The article further elaborates on the importance of the human body image in Manipuri society, and how the body philosophy pervades different areas of life. It also examines how the philosophy of the sacred body is now secularized in children's alphabet books in order to be taught in the modern nation-state.

Our team gathered for the morn ing ritual offerings, and we started climbing in a single file to the peak. At the summit, the stone formations are thought of as parts of the human face resembling twenty seven letters of the Meitei alphabet. I stood by and watched members of the group make offerings to the stone forma tions. As circles of smoke from the burning incense rose higher and high er disappearing among the clouds, the Iril river shone in the distance. "This is the letter 'na,' it means the right ear," said Ojha M., a prominent religious leader pointing to a stone formation; "this place where we are standing is the head," and pointing to the river, he indicated, "those are the nerves of the body." This moment has remained with me, during the course of my research on the body and the alphabet. Orthography and Ideology in the Current Context Studies in orthography are perhaps the first branch of Literacy Studies, which rapidly developed in tandem with the linguistic pursuits of the mis sionaries working on Bible translation projects in different parts of the world (Smalley 1964). In recent years, however, debates over orthograph ic choices have become integral to studies of language from a cultural perspective (Schieffelin and Doucet 1999). Ethnographic examples of mys tic traditions that legitimize a writing system abound throughout the world (Smalley 1991), and the politics of nationalism have also been an intrinsic factor in the choice of orthography in many cases. In this article, I explore the cultural scenario that framed the contest over the choice of orthography of the Meitei language in Northeastern India. I argue against the grain of the popular assumption that language and writing is the exclusive domain of linguists. To achieve a fuller understanding of lan guage and orthography, one has to take into account the cultural process that accounts for legitimizing a writing system in society. Brinkley Messick (1993) has shown for example how the pattern of writing in a text could be a central organizing principle of a society in Yemen, while William Hanks (2000) has convincingly demonstrated that the orientation of domestic and social space in the Yucatan follows the unconscious linguistic structure in Mexico. These two cases illustrate sep arate patterns of language and writing with separate processes of repli cation in the cultural space. My concern in this article is with orthogra 130</page><page sequence="3">_SQHINI RAY phy and the patterns embedded in it. A study of Whitney's Sanskrit gram mar shows that in the orthographic systems of Indo-Aryan languages, the letters of the alphabet are grouped according to their points of articula tion (Whitney 1967). Among other recent studies of literacy and culture, those of Niko Besnier (1995) and Laura Ahearn (2001) are also noteworthy. Besnier looks at the changing patterns of communication between individuals in Polynesia, con current with the introduction to literacy by the missionaries; Ahearn's work is a groundbreaking account of the acquisition of female agency through the introduction of literacy which has resulted in the changing marriage patterns among the Magars in Nepal. Literacy and gender remains a rela tively unexplored topic but has found some attention in the series of works by anthropologists and language specialist focusing on the Nushu, a writing system used exclusively by women of China (McLaren 1996, Silber 1994) My work aims to contribute to the larger discourse of the place of lan guage and writing in India focusing specifically on the choice of orthogra phy for the Meitei language in the northeastern region of the country. Bernard Cohn (1985) was one of the first to include the study of language in the history of colonial India, as he claimed that it was one of the tools through which British officers exerted control. However, Partha Chatterjee (1993) has discussed the emergence of nationalist thought in India, empha sizing language as one of the domains of life which the Indians claimed through the nationalist movement. Sub-national politics dealing with lan guage have also gained attention in recent academic publications, the best examples being Sumati Ramaswamy's (1997) work on Tamil in south India and Nivedita Mohanty's (1982) research on Oriya. These studies demon strated the importance of the role of language in defining regional nation alism in India. The complex politics of the divergence of Hindi and Urdu as separate languages are yet another example of how linguistic issues are intertwined with stories of nationhood (King 1994). In this essay my aim is two-fold. First, I trace how the cosmology of the body in the ancient Meitei religion transgresses the arena of the sacred to influence the orthography of the now-secular writing system of Meitei language. Second, I demonstrate how the orthographic debates in Meitei society and the process of choosing a script led to the translation of the sacred words from the puyas, or religious manuscripts, to secular images in children's alphabet books. Since the Indian nation is a secular state, the religious philosophy behind the writing system cannot be included in the 131</page><page sequence="4">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India school curriculum. Thus, the images that bear the essence of the philoso phy are included instead. Historic/Ethnographic Background Manipur, situated near the border of India and Burma, is the home of the Meiteis, a linguistic group of approximately one million speakers. Several groups of people have migrated to the Manipur valley from both South East Asia and South Asia. The Meitei Muslims and Meitei Brahmins have migrated from South Asia. T. C. Hodson (1908) writes that the word "Meitei" has its origin in two words, Mei which means man and thei which means other. So, Meitei literally means the other man.1 The Meitei com munity has its own religion and related ritual practices since ancient times, and this religion has been recently named "Sanamahism." Sanamahism has its own pantheon of deities and religious philosophy. The major festival of the faith is Lai-haraoba. In 1727, a Hindu missionary from Bengal came to preach Hindu Vaishnavism in Manipur. The king of Manipur decided to convert to Hinduism and ordered all his subjects to do so immediately. The king ordered a number of the sacred manuscripts to be destroyed by fire.2 The original script of the Meitei community was discarded at this time, since the Bengali script (originally used to write Bengali, a Sanskrit-derived Indo-Aryan language) was used to write the Meitei language. What fol lowed was an era of syncretic adoption of the two religious traditions. In their daily life, Sanamahi followers prayed to the god in the main room of the house (a corner of the room is kept partitioned and offerings are made there.) It is important to note that in this system of worship there is no use of images. A Meitei person also prayed to the Tulsi (basil) plant as it is considered to be a representation of the Brinda devi, a deity wor shipped in the Hindu Vaishnavite faith. Every Meitei household had a Tulsi plant in the center of its courtyard.3 In the 1940s however, a rethinking of the cultural history of the Meitei community commenced among the Meitei settlements of Cachar, a district in the Assam, the neighboring state of Manipur. The pioneering figure of this movement was Naoriya Phullo, the first person to envision establishing the ancient Meitei faith, devoid of all Hindu influences as the sole religion of the community. This movement today has become an important part of Meitei cultural life in Manipur. In 1947 with the independence of India the state of 132</page><page sequence="5">_SQHINI RAY Table 1: The Thirty-five Letter Alphabet ~Ve?ar I Ke M I Khe ^ l Ge IF I Ghe K I Ne M Palatal Ce HZ ~Che y? ~je Z Jhe ^ Ne / Retroflex_Te SS\ The "S De ft Dhe Rfl Ne H Dental_Te S6 The % De ST Dhe 3" Ne g Labial_Pe M Phe E Be ^ Bhe H" Me FE Glides/Liquids Ae HT ~Ye R Re BT Le g We U Fricative_e 1ST Se B She C9 He "a Kshe a Manipur merged with the newly formed Indian union but the history of this merger has always been complicated. After a long and turbulent struggle to achieve the status of a state (a major administrative division within India) in the early 1970s, the members of the Meitei community realized that the next step of recognition for them within the Indian nation would be inclusion of their language in the Indian constitution. Concurrently, the Meiteis realized that they needed to revive their original writing system lost during the time of the eighteenth century religious conversion. The attempted revival of the writing system, which had been part of the marginal religious revival move ment, thus became a pan-Manipuri phenomenon, and people irrespective of religious affiliation came to support it. At this point several debates broke out within the community regard ing the nature of the orthography of the "authentic script." The versions presented by two factions of the community were completely different. One of them was in the nature of Sanskrit writing systems and consisted of thirty-five letters grouped according to the points of articulation (see Table 1). The other had a completely different logic of organization of the letters arranged according to the parts of the body: the anthropomorphic manifestation of Taibangpanba mapu, the high god of the Meitei religion (see Table 2). The philosophy of the letters is found in a religious manu script named Wakoklon hi lei thilel Salai a mi Ion pukok puya.4 With respect to the first system as shown in Table 1, velar sounds are those that are pronounced from the back of the mouth, palatal sounds are pro nounced with the tongue against the roof of the mouth, retroflex sounds are pronounced with the tongue curled back, and dental sounds are pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the back of the teeth?the position of the tongue at the end of the word "bath."

(Differences between most un-aspirated and aspirated consonants are diffi cult to discern in speaking) The letters in this system are referred to by their phonemic sounds, eg. ka, kha, ga, gha and so on. The twenty-seven-letter system consists of eighteen primary letters and nine additional ones. The pattern of arrangement of the first eighteen let ters follows the parts of the body (see Figure 1). The additional nine are derived from them. The pattern of arrangement of the twenty-seven let ters also follows the logic of a religious philosophy. The letters themselves are referred to by the names of the body parts that they are derived from, for example, kok (head), sam (hair-parting), lai (means forehead) and so on. Table 3 shows the nine letters that were added later and specifies those of the primary letters from which they are derived. Despite the fact that the thirty-five-letter system was supported by all the academics of the state, including several linguists and archeologists, the state committee voted for the twenty-seven-letter alphabet, which thereafter became the script of choice to write the Meitei language.5 In the following sections, I examine the cultural dynamics within the Meitei community that led to this choice.

It is a manuscript in archaic Meitei language in which the philosophical mean ing behind the shape and form of each of the letters is described: Each of the letters is imagined to resemble a different part of the human body. The first letter kok resembles the head, and the word kok also means head. The second letter sam resembles the hair part ing, and the word sam means hair. The letter lai resembles the fore head. The word for forehead is laipak, and the word lai is an abbre viation of laipak. The letter mit resembles the shape of human eye, and the word mit means eye in Meitei language. The letter pa resem bles the shape of the eyelid; the word pa also means the hair on the eyelid. The letter na resembles the shape of the ear, and the word na also means the ear. The letter chil is derived from the shape of a human mouth. The letter til resembles the source of saliva in the mouth, and the word til is metaphorically derived from the word tillang. The letter khou represents the chin, and the word khou is derived from the Meitei word khoudang, which means the chin. The letter ngou resembles the palate or the roof of the mouth, and the word ngou in Meitei language also means the same. The letter thou resemble the rib cage, and the word thou is an abbreviation of the word thoupak that means chest. The letter wai resembles the heart. The letter yang resembles the vertebral column, and the word yang 136</page><page sequence="9">_SOHINI RAY means the vertebral column as well. The letter huk resembles the sit ting posture of the entire human skeleton. The letter un resembles the form of human skin, and the word un is derived from the Meitei word unsha, which means skin. The letter // represents blood and the word ii means blood in Meitei language. The letter pham metaphor ically represents the body as the seat of the god, as the letter is shaped like a seat. The word pham also means seat in Meitei lan guage. The letter atiya represents the sky, and the word atiya also means the sky. (Thoukachanba 1978) The above paragraph is a summary translation of the contents of the Wakoklon puya?a detailed analysis of the metaphors and nuances of which is beyond the scope of this essay. Even though there have been sev eral controversies regarding the authenticity of the Wakoklon puya, and many segments of Meitei society still do not accept it as an authoritative text, it is taught to every student in the state-sponsored Meitei mayek (lit erally meaning Manipuri script) teacher's training course. This course is taught in various state-sponsored institutions and is mandatory for every individual who wants to be a teacher of Meitei mayek. During the course of my fieldwork I attended the teacher's training course and studied the puya. But what interested me more than the theo logical contents of the manuscript were the stories that surrounded this sacred doctrine. Many elders in the community told me that this manuscript was hidden away to be saved from the wrath of the king as following his conversion to Vaishnavism the royal family disapproved of pre-Hindu man uscripts. Some oral proverbs in Meitei language bear testimony to this story. One example, "Ke ke kru moirang kekru nacha namba sangai namba yotgi porol laigi shamchet,..." may be translated as "something written has been kept concealed in hands of Moirangs [name of a Meitei clan], and it should be told to your own sons or sons-in-laws, not to your relatives." Another such proverb, "Houroubigi hingolda lashing polang phoubani yen shokani konnaraba ting ting" may be rendered as "0 men of the future, something has been secretly preserved for you in the land where the hill people dwell so that it does not come to the king's attention. If the king knows one could get hurt." Older people in the community explain that these proverbs point to the fact that the ancient script of the Meitei people was preserved as a closely guarded secret, especially from the attention of the royal establish ment who at that time supported Bengali script. These stories belong to the 137</page><page sequence="10">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India oral historical traditions of the community and are not found in any writ ten record, such as the royal chronicle.6 These untold stories are not the "official history" of the Meitei society; the contents of the puya along with such beliefs and tales played an important role in the modern orthograph ic debates of the secular state. The idea of the letters of the alphabet resem bling the body raises the question about the place the sacred body might occupy in Meitei faith. I was reminded of Ojha-M.'s teaching that "the body is the temple of god, if you want to do something for god, do it for your own body." With this ethnographic context in mind, I started exploring the mul tiple layers of meanings that the body holds in Meitei society. In the follow ing section, I will establish the importance of the image of the human in the ritual and cultural life of the Meitei people. The Body Cosmology as a Cultural Schema Use of the body as a design for patterning or ordering society is not new in anthropology. However, while the discourse on the anthropology of the body has expanded vastly in different directions within the disci pline, the connections between cosmology and the body still remain rel atively unexplored. The most noted work in this domain is Carol Delaney's The Seed and the Soil (1991). This seminal text looks at the cos mological faith of a rural community in Turkey and analyzes its gender dimensions and its significance in everyday life. In previous ethnograph ic studies of Meitei cosmology (Brara 1998) the cosmological significance of ritual kingship has been extensively discussed. In N. Vijaylakshmi Brara's description of the cosmology of statehood, the state is imagined as the body of a human. The newly crowned king ritually crosses the umbilical cord during the ceremony to be "re-born" in his new life as a ruler. Homologous to this is the idea of installing the gods or the spirit by the maibi (female priestesses in the ancient religion) to the body of the newborn (Brara 1998). The notion of cosmology in the ancient Meitei faith is extensive and could encompass several studies. In the present essay, I have described the body cosmology of the ancient Meitei faith as an arrangement of the body parts in different areas of the universe. The mapping of the universe or different elements of the surroundings with the metaphor of the body is seldom discussed or looked at in an anthropological study of cosmology. In this case, the human body is a schema that is found in the different cosmological 138</page><page sequence="11">_SOHINI RAY domains of Meitei sacred thought?the universe, the land, the house, and later on, the alter offerings and the sacred floor design. The cosmology of the body parts following the anthropomorphic form is thus an integral part of the Meitei faith system. Two other cosmological arrangements of the body that are found in the Meitei faith system are that of the narrative of gestures in a sacred dance and that found in the beliefs associated with the martial arts. As I have previously noted, the twenty-seven letters of Meitei mayek consist of eighteen primary letters that were the most ancient letters in the writing system and nine added ones. In my extensive oral interviews with Ojha M., I also discovered that the number eighteen has ritual significance in Meitei life, since the impor tant elements of the universe are also eighteen (See Table 4). When I asked what the elements of the universe have to do with the human body, Ojha-M. replied that the five elements of nature (Numbers 1-5 in the table) are all represented in the human body. The eighteen let ters therefore have their roots in the body. At the very beginning there was fire, and then the five elements were formed from this. The sun started giv ing light during the day and the moon gave light at night. The seven main stars in the sky (Number 7-14 in Table 4) are arranged according to the pat tern of a human body, with the North Star being the head. The manuscript Leithak leikharol puya describes the process of creation of the elements of the universe in detail, much of which is beyond the scope of this essay. The notion of the stars being arranged according to the pattern of the body struck me as something in continuity with the cultural schema of the body. The notion of the seven stars being arranged in a group is an old one and in Hindu belief, it is referred to as the Saptarishi mandal (the seven sages), whereas in the West it is called Orion's Way. What differs in the Meitei case is that the stars are arranged in the pattern of the human body. "We will be going to our yearly pilgrimage to Koubru on the day of Imoinu-puja [worship of Goddess Imoinu], do you want to come with us?" Ojha-M. asked me one day. As the anecdote related at in the beginning of this essay suggests, the pilgrimage to Koubru was to give me rich insights into the alphabet and its relation to body imagery. The geography of the land of Manipur is imagined to be a human body. Mount Koubru situated in the north of Manipur is one of the main pilgrimage sites in the pre-Hindu faith. The stone formations on the peak are conceived of as the parts of the face from which the letters of the alphabet are derived. The members of the pilgrimage made offerings to every letter of the alphabet that morning, 139</page><page sequence="12">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India Table 4: Elements of the Universe and the Corresponding English Names No, Khununglon Inunglon English Sanskrit (archaic (modern _ language)_ language) _j_ | 1. kampi_ Mei fire_ | 2. | laicha Ishing water_j 3.

The cosmology of the body as manifested in the land of Manipur is described as follows in oral accounts: Lake Khongampat is the heart; Kangla (the old royal fort) is the naval center. Lake Loktak is the reproduc tive organ; Nungthong in Sugnu is the anus and urethra. The three impor tant rivers, Imphal Iril, and Nambul form the veins and arteries. The Langol hill is the right hand, and the Thangjing hill the right leg. The Nongmaijing hill is the left hand. Wangbren hill is the left leg. Mountain Koubru, where we went for the pilgrimage is imagined to be the head of this body and also a center of many sacred myths in the Meitei faith. 140</page><page sequence="13">_SOHINI RAY The body mythology is perpetuated in the traditional architecture of Manipur. Given a frontal view of the Meitei Yumjao or house, the top is identified as the Sandang Kha or the door of the soul at the front side of the top of the head. The front door is the mouth; the two windows on the two upper sides of the door are the two nostrils. The bridge of the nose at the forehead is the small opening above the door. Seen from the side view, the roof ridge is the spinal column, and the top roof structure is the ribs. The two legs are the pillars, and the edges of the roofs are the two hands. The window at the rear of the house jointly represents the anus and the urinal tract together. The Phunga Lairu, or the fireplace, represents the navel aper ture. The three stones on the three sides of the navel aperture are known as Mangang, Luwang, and Khuman (names of the three most important clans of the Meiteis). It is of note that none of these body parts relate to any thing that identifies the gender of this imagined body. Ojha-M. is of the opinion that it is the body of the divine Taibangpanba Mapu Sidaba and is thus beyond gender. In a house, however, the left side is identified as female and the right side is identified as male. According to some scholars in Manipur, the reason why the part of the body is female is because the home is a place of fertility, which is associated with women. In another opinion, the house is identified with Taibangpanba Mapu Sidaba and thus beyond gender. The various parts of the body as correlated with the parts of a traditional house therefore are shown in Table 5. When there is important worship to be performed, for example, when there is a serious illness in the community, an offering is made to Lainingthou Sanamahi, the most important deity of the Meitei pantheon. The way in which the offering is laid out resembles that of the human body. The phambal (seat) representing the headgear appears at the top of the offering. In the center of the main body of the offering is a banana leaf with two others at the two sides. At the base of the leaves, there is a rectangle made of sticks and at the center of the sticks there is an earthen pot containing water. This represents the navel or the center of the body. At the four corners of the navel, there are four deities that guard the naval center. On each of the banana leaves there is a small leaf where rice is offered. This represents the stomach. The two wings of the banana leaf represent the breasts. The seven kinds of flowers, which are placed in a line on the right side, represent the right hand and the right foot. The seven kinds of fruits arranged linearly on the left side represent the left hand and the foot. 141</page><page sequence="14">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India Table 5: Parts of the Body as Correlated to the House Part of the house Part of the house Corresponding Body (Meitei) (English)_part_ kanchi ridgepole backbone hundangrok ridges along the wall nerves phaklang wall_skin_ mamayang tariba front of the house_face_ thongjao (mamang) main door mouth maningthong back aperture backdoor mit window eyes_ phunga hearth naval yenkai rafters (beam) esophagus shai roof front of the hair style of young women (according to some) Pallandhabi is one of the most sacred designs of the traditional Meitei faith. It is said that during the time when the earth was forming, mother earth took and formed the Paphal in her own body. Salailel Sidaba (name of the high god of Meitei religion) asked Pakhangba to form the Paphal so that the earth does not break again. The upper point of the star is the head, the right hand and the foot are the two right-side hands, and the left hand and the foot are the two left-side points of the stars. The sacred design represent ing the body thus produced is manifested in different ways. In Thang-ta or Manipuri martial arts, the design of Pallandhabi is traced on the floor by steps along with the movements of the thang or the swords held in both hands. The mythology of the body in the ancient Meitei faith thus provides an important commentary on the studies of cosmology and the body. While I would refrain from essentializing the body in Meitei faith to be fixed in any singular order, it is fair to say that the anthropomorphic form signi fies a cosmic pattern in the Meitei life that surfaced significantly during the orthographic debates.7 In contrast to the Turkish faith (Delaney 1991), the cosmology of the body of the Meitei faith does not take gender into account. Instead it advocates the imagining of a divine anthropomorphic form that is beyond gender. The central idea of the philosophy of the Meitei mayek is that the let ters are derived from the different parts of the body. When asked about 142</page><page sequence="15">_SQHINI RAY the gender of this body Ojha-Mreplied that this body belongs to none other than the Supreme Being, who is beyond gender, neither man nor woman, and so the body is beyond gender. It struck me that each of the letters in the alphabet resembled parts of the human body, but each one of them were non-gendered body-parts. In thinking about this explicit silence regarding questions of gender, I was tempted to interrogate Ojha-M on this a bit further. During a ques tion-and-answer session following prayer, I asked why there is no gender. I stressed how I should answer to people in the West when they ask me about gender of the body of Taibangpanba mapu. Ojha-M's reply was "it is a concept that the outside people in the West are yet to fathom that we have here in the Manipur." Even though I did not agree with him, I noted the nationalist sentiment that echoed in his words. Also, while the unspo ken androgyny in Ojha-M's preachings and the gender politics of Meitei society could be the subject of another project, I choose to focus on the anthropomorphic images in the cosmological beliefs of the ancient Meitei faith and the cultural pattern that they construct. In the next subsection, I look at the traditions of the bodily movements in the Meitei society and decipher the patterns by which they are connected. Cosmology of Gestures Lai-haraoba, the most important festival of the pre-Hindu religion, is cel ebrated widely by the Meiteis. During this festival the women priestesses, the maibis, propitiate the indigenous deity by performing various dances. One of the dances that is obligatorily performed in front of the god is the enactment of the creation of the body. In order to learn more about the philosophical aspects of this dance I went to meet T. maibi during my fieldwork. Eighty years old, T. maibi is the oldest living maibi in Manipur and he is also an exceptional case among the maibis because he is male.8 He became a maibi through divine intervention. An excerpt from my interview with T. Maibi follows: "The navel aperture in the human body is as important as a sacred pilgrim spot; on top of this spot the lotus blooms, and that is where guru or the Supreme Being exists, and the Supreme Being's shadow falls on the water. Atiya guru sidaba or the Supreme Being was a bird before; then he became toad and later after a number of incarna 143</page><page sequence="16">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India tions, the human body was created after looking at the guru's shad ow. In the body of a pregnant woman, the child stays in the water. From the navel, everyday the child grows up. So, as he grows in 364 days, the initial stage is 64 days and the later stage is 300 days. The 64 hand gestures in the dance form that are used to describe the making of the human body signify 64 days. Later, 300 are added. Thus, 364 gestures have come to existence. When a child is born, the top of the head is soft because the guru comes in through there and stays on the navel. Ima Leimarel resides on the left side of the body, and Lainingthou Sanamahi on the right side of the body. Guru is present in the eyes to make us [human beings] distinguish between dark and light. The body hair in different parts such as head, armpits, and genitalia represents umang or forest, and it is from this concept that word umang-lai has developed. The navel is a very important holy spot, which is even more important than the ocean. The different parts present in the ocean are all present in the body. The nerves and veins, 108 in number are all more important than the ocean. Women have 12 opening/doors in their bodies, and men have 10." (T. maibi: personal communication 1998) As I listened to T. maibi, I asked him how the dance performed in Lai Haraoba is related to the philosophy of the body. He replied that the dance was a celebration of nature's process of the replication of life, and thus a celebration of the process in which life is created. The dancing sig nifies the making of the first body in the universe, i.e. the body of the Supreme Being. The imaging of the human body and the attempted correlation of the number of gestures with the birth cycle is yet another example of the pervasive cosmological principles of the Meitei faith. The Lai-haraoba festival itself signifies the making of the universe, and the ritual per formance of the dances of the making of the body in the festival signi fies the making of the body of the Supreme Being, the same body from which the letters of the 27-letter alphabet are derived. This ritual per formance of body-making is accomplished through a series of hand ges tures. The 64 hand gestures and their correlation with the number of days in the gestation cycle of a human infant reveal a cosmic pattern. Even though the cosmology of the body described here differs consider ably from that described earlier in this essay, this variation of the body 144</page><page sequence="17">_SQHINI RAY cosmology is yet another example of the cultural schema of the body in the Meitei society. Letters as a Protection of the Human Body?Another Cosmology Thang-ta, the martial art of Manipur, is one of the oldest martial art tra ditions of South Asia. Rich in combat techniques it also includes a tradi tion of occult practices to be used during war. Martial arts in Manipur has a very long tradition, and at present martial arts are popularly used as a performing art, rather than in training the real warriors. There are sever al martial arts institutions in the state that train artists to perform Thang ta mostly on stage as choreographed combats or theater or dance produc tions. The mystic traditions surrounding Thang-ta are completely hidden from non-practioners.9 The following is an excerpt from an interview with an elder of the community. "The body of the warrior is protected by the letters of the alphabet during a combat. Apart from the above, thoughts there is another aspect of the Meitei mayek. Each of the letters represents a deity and resides in a part of the human body. And, they are in charge of protecting that part of the body. The list of letters is as follows: Atiya Sidaba (remain/protects in the front) = "kok" (HI) Thongarel (remain/protects the back) = "thou" [Equivalent to Lord Yama] (3?) Koubru (remain/protects the right side) = "atiya" (m) Nongpok achiba, an incarnation of Sanamahi (remain/protects the left side) = "pa" (M) Soraren (remain/protects the top) = "til" ($&gt;) Lainingthou Sanamahi (remain/protects the forehead) = "lai" (5") Pakhangba (remain/protects the breast) = "kok" (HI)" This is one of the most profound bodies of knowledge of the Meitei community. Our great warrior heroes practiced the worship of these forces so that during a war their bodies could be protected. Have you heard stories of Paona Brajabasi? He was highly proficient in black art and had many magical powers. There were so many times during the Khomjom war when there were bullets directed towards him, but they flew away to another direction, because of his magical powers. ...This art 145</page><page sequence="18">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India was very highly developed among our Meitei heroes. But these had to be used carefully as any mishandling of this knowledge can lead to danger and even death. ...There are other things that are even more dangerous than what I have told you." The magical practices of the Meitei warrior tradition are extensive and beyond the scope of the current project. Thang-ta or the Meitei martial art tradition has an extensive training for warriors on magical practices like thengkourol. Phillip Zarrilli (1998) has shown how martial arts in Asia, even though popularly seen as performative entertainment, encompass extensive tradi tions of sacred ritual practices. The role of the Meitei letters of the alphabet as a divine agent of protection also indicates the presence of their deities. Each of the letters has a ruling deity and is responsible for protecting a part of the body.10 There are many accounts of combats from the historic battle of Khomjom.11 Especially noteworthy is that of Paona Brajabasi, document ed in the book Paona Brajabasi written by his grandson, which describes in detail the last combat of this legendary warrior of Manipur. Here it is said that Paona Brajabasi, who was conversant in the sacred arts of invoking pro tection from the deities, was able to deflect many of the bullets from the enemy's side. Letters are thus used as a mystical protective device for the body. The cosmological pattern, in this case, maps the body into different zones, and designates the different letters to protect each zone. Body as Icon, Embodied Practice, and Cultural Schema Having established above the different tenets of the body philosophy in Meitei cultural life, in this section I look at how the image of the static body, along with the philosophy behind bodily movement traditions, con tribute to the cultural foundations of Meitei society. In her discussion of the Sherpa temple founding, Sherry Ortner (1989) has discussed how the different patterns of the themes in the stories of temple founding have been repeated in different mythologies, thus in every case sustaining the temple-founding process in the Sherpa commu nity. Marshall Sahlins (1981) has related how the coming of Captain Cook related to a "cosmological drama" that re-iterated a fixed "cultural inscription" within the Hawaiian community. In the case of Meitei cosmol ogy, I see the arrangement of the human body as the unsaid "cultural inscription" that functions as a schema within the Meitei society. 146</page><page sequence="19">_SQHINI RAY The religious revival movement has its own emphasis on the bodily order that includes the body in everyday practice. The sacrosanct space of the human body delineates in the practice of exercises called Chingkheirol and the strengthening of the body are given a heightened status in the revived form of the religion. This gives the observer a glimpse into the everyday body politic of the Meitei society, where the cosmological order of the body is being reinstated in people's minds through everyday practice. "The next time you come, you have to learn how to write in Meitei mayek and you have to learn Thang-ta and exercises. Only then you can know our religion, only studying texts will not be enough." Ojha-M advised me when I first met him that "The practice of exercises teaches you discipline, makes you fit. With the conversion to Hinduism, our culture lost its heroic ele ments. It is time that we try to bring them back." Paul Connerton argues that, "Bodily practices of a culturally specific kind entail a combination of cognitive and habit-memory" (1989:88). The practice of Chingkheirol by the revivalist groups and the mass participation in the dances of Lai-haraoba festival could be seen as a formation of habit-memory for the body. I would like to pose the question vis-a-vis cultural schema: Is the embodied notion of the self the instrument that makes the body such a powerful cosmic icon in Meitei society? While I do not offer any simple answer to this question, I am reminded of what W. J. T. Mitchell (1981) writes in discussing imagery, "If there were no more minds, there would be no more images, mental or material. The world may depend upon consciousness, but images in (not to mention of) the world clearly do" (Mitchell 1986:17). In light of Mitchell's statement, I would propose that human beings, in a quest for their origins, have often constructed images of the divine as an anthropomorphic form. It is thus not surprising that the body is held so sacred in Meitei society.12 What is the role of the human bodily con sciousness then in constructing those images? Does the notion of embod ied selfhood in everyday life contribute to the notion of the divine body? What is remarkable is that the anthropomorphic form is being the cultur al pattern that is replicated again and again in the Meitei way of life. In the following section, I will demonstrate that the secularization of the cosmology and the sustenance of the pattern of body cosmology through the writing system?that is, the propagation of the orthography through printed texts in the children's textbooks?is yet another example of the cultural schema of the body being spread throughout Meitei socie ty. Whereas Ortner (1989) has focused her discussion of cultural schemas 147</page><page sequence="20">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India to the story of temple founding, I demonstrate how the same cosmologi cal schema can transgress its ritual arena and be meaningful in the mod ern debate of orthographic choice in a secular nation-state. Sacred to Secular: Science as a Grounding for Eighteen Separation of state and religion was adopted by the Indian nation at its very inception and codified into article 28 of its constitution. Once the writing system of a region was accepted by the Indian state, language text books were written and printed using it. The now state-sponsored writing system had to be separated from its religious significance in order to be taught in state-sponsored educational institutions. At this juncture, Meitei preachers and script experts consciously tried to disassociate their writing system from its religious philosophy, employ ing a secular rationale in teaching and propagating it. In my extensive interviews and study sessions with different religious practioners and experts on the script, I observed the attempt to justify the cosmology of the eighteen primary by science or scientific "truths." Rajeev Bhargava (1998) has argued that secularism in India goes hand in hand with glorify ing science and scientific rationales. In the following examples from the preaching sessions, I found the attempt to construct the cosmology of the Meitei in the terms of science. Ojha-M. for example explained to me that the number eighteen is signif icant in different aspects of life. He referred to a translated edition of a Russian book on human physiology which said that the human heart beats on the eighteenth day of human life on the earth. Quoting from the same book he told me that water, which is the giver of life to every living being on earth, is composed of eighteen compounds. He also spoke of the work of Gabriel Bertrand, a French biochemist whom he said maintained the human body contains eighteen elements. These forms of scientific conjecture mag nify the importance of the number eighteen in human lives. It is clear from Ojha M.'s citations that science is the hegemonic episte mology through which the cosmology of the eighteen is rationalized and made secular and respectable. As Sharon Traweek (1988) has argued, "Physicists of course do not see themselves as writing the cosmology of some secular religion: for them, religion is about belief rather than knowl edge. But they do see their own profession as the revelation and custody of fundamental truth and to a surprising degree Western culture confirms 148</page><page sequence="21">_SQHINI RAY them in this privileged role" (Traweek 1988:2). The mention of science and scientific truth holds a place in modern Indian society higher than any reli gion. It is indeed ironic that cosmology, traditionally the domain of theolo gians, is being interpreted through the science in order to make it believ able and to gain wider acceptance in Meitei society. Ashish Nandy (1988), in his essay in the volume Science, Hegemony, and Violence, has demonstrated the multiple dimensions of the use of science in Indian society. Unlike many nations in India, science has traditionally been a civilian's enterprise and has not been funded by the army or any dictatorship;13 As Nandy has com mented on modern India, "science has become the new reason of the state" (1988), since India remained the sole domain of scientists without creating any space for a critique by non-scientists.14 As Nandy remarks, "Because the concept of science in this model of scientific growth is that of the ultimate key to all the problems facing the country, scientists subscribing to the model can lay claims to the charisma which in some other political cultures belongs exclusively to god-kings" (1988:8). Based on my fieldwork experience with Meitei mayek, I would agree that science is the new religion of Indian society and argue that the pro ponents of the twenty-seven-letter Meitei mayek are merely conforming to the notion by resorting to science when advocating for the script. As I was returning from Mount Koubru, I remarked how thankful I was that I got to see the stone formations. One of the members of the group responded that she hoped that I found it all very scientific. The use of the language of science thus not only rationalizes the cosmology in modern minds but also reaffirms the cultural inscription of the number eighteen with examples drawn from modern science. The cosmological principle of the sacred eighteen is thus secularized and reincarnated in the new reli gion of the modern India?the language of science. Orthography as Secular Cosmology Michael Herzfeld (1991) and Liisa Malkii (1995) have studied how the order of nation-states can be comparable to the cosmological order in the uni verse. In doing so, they use the term "secular cosmologies." Liisa Malkii (1995) in her study of the Hutu refugee camps in Tanzania has described how the study of nation-states can be looked upon as an analysis of an order or a pattern in a universe, and thus the place of illegal refugees does not correspond to the "correct" order, rather they are looked upon as peo 149</page><page sequence="22">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India pie "out of place" or outside the normal order of things. Herzfeld (1991) in his study of bureaucracies has shown that, just as the elements of the uni verse are supposed to be arranged in a particular order, so nation-states and their bureaucracies closely adhere to cosmological patterns. In the case of the twenty-seven-letter alphabet, the cosmology of the body as a cultural schema is extended to the modern and secular writing system, which is a part of the everyday life of the Meitei people. Here the pattern of the orthography or the logic of arrangement of the letters follows the pattern of the parts of the human body. The first two pages of the chil dren's alphabet book of the twenty-seven-letter Meitei mayek have sketch es of the body parts along with the letters. (Fig I) After the state accepted the twenty-seven-letter orthography, these books were printed. The Wakoklon puya is a sacred document that does not have any pictures. It describes the body and relates a letter's shape and form to a particular body part. The question here is, does drawing these images secularize the body? And how does this secular body translate to the learner? In contrast to the sacred "order of things" that I have explored hereto fore, the images in the children's alphabet book are secular, and this is a very conscious decision. Endorsed by the state, they are teaching aids for a secular writing system. The cultural schema as expressed by the sacred body is thus transferred to secular letters and the orthography of the twenty-seven-letter Meitei alphabet translates to a secular cosmology. The sacred theology nonetheless haunts the letters. The striking feature of the twenty-seven-letter Meitei mayek is that the names of the letters are not phonetic but are the names of the body parts. In the first pages of children's alphabet book, the letters are written along with their names, and the names of the body part that they are named after and resemble in shape and form. In the state-sponsored secular education system in India the philosophy of the letters being derived from the sacred body cannot be taught. Therefore, in the secular textbooks where the theol ogy cannot be discussed, the proper names of the letters of the alphabet become the agent that is represented by the pictures. The philosophy of the sacred body parts is thus transferred to the drawings through the names of the letters that are synonymous with the names of the body parts. The use of proper names as an agenct of propagation of an ideology is not new in anthropology. Mary Steedly's (1996) study of landscapes in Indonesia attests to this. While Steedly (1996) argues for the use of place names as a marker of authenticity in the postcolonial context in Indonesia, in this case the 150</page><page sequence="23">_SQHINI RAY names of letters of the alphabet in the twenty-seven-letter writing system legitimize the images which now, stripped of their sacred context, are teach ing tools for children. But their presence in the alphabet books does remind the learners of the script and the unspoken context. The names and the pic tures together translate the theology of the Wakoklon puya, but in the writ ten discourse of the twenty-seven-letter alphabet, as taught in the state sponsored education system, the puya remains hidden in the background. Conclusion The ideology behind the choice of the twenty-seven-letter alphabet over the thirty-five-letter alphabet has a long cultural process behind it. The theology of the Wakoklon puya concerns the philosophy of the twenty seven letters. The sacred body mentioned in the puya can map the belief system of the ancient Meitei faith. The cultural schema of the body per vades not only the sacred cosmology but also the secular, as ultimately the orthography of the alphabet is legitimized by the cosmological pat tern of the arrangement of the parts of the human body. While the trans lation process of the theology of the text into images is reminiscent of W. J. T. Mitchell's analysis of words to images (1986:42), my concern is the nature of the images, as the word and the image in this context have yet another binary: the sacred and the secular. The cosmological domain traces the roots of the body parts to the sacred anthropomorphic image of the high god of the Meitei religion. In everyday religious practices how ever, I see that movement traditions, such as the dance and the exercises, build the embodied knowledge among the people that substantiates the body as icon. This icon, when brought to the secular arena of orthogra phy, still holds the ground for the body in the children's alphabet books. As every young student in the everyday school experiences the letters of the alphabet through images, the secular writing system endorsed by the Indian nation-state silently bears the spirit and the meaning of the sacred text. The order of the secular images replicates the order of the sacred turned-secular body, while divinity stays silent in the background. 151</page><page sequence="24">Writing the Body: Cosmology, Orthography, and Fragments of Modernity in Northeastern India ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The materials for this article were collected as part of my dissertation. I thank the chair of my committee Paul Kroskrity for his intellectual inspiration, and the UCLA Anthropology department for a generous grant. I am deeply indebted to Michael Herzfeld for many stimulating discussions. The article was written when I was a fellow in the University of California Humanities Research Institute in University of California, Irvine. I am grateful to Institute director David Goldberg for inviting me, and to the other fellows for their interest in my work. Leslie Stern and two anonymous reviewers of Antropological Quarterly provided many helpful insights and Lynne Kostman edited a draft. Michael Everson provided invaluable help in typing the Meitei mayek. My greatest debt however is to the people of the Manipur among who are my several teachers, friends and colleagues. To maintain confidentiality I have used pseudonyms in the arti cle to refer to some of them. The little I have accomplished is from their warmth, kind ness, and generosity. I am solely responsible for all errors. ENDNOTES 1There are several theories about the spelling of the name "Meitei." There is a compet ing view within the community that the spelling "Meetei" is more accurate. While both spellings have a mythological basis for their claims, currently both of them have passed their mythological significance, signifying the political affiliation of the scholar. For my usage, I have retained the spelling "Meitei" for convenience in academic cataloguing but do acknowledge the presence of the other point of view. 2This incident is highly controversial and debated within the community and there are several views and evidence about how it happened. Currently it is commemorated by a national day of somber protest in remembrance of the script. 3There are several schools of history and anthropology in Manipur, and the traditional school looks at this change in a positive light. However, a recent school of scholars views it in a negative light, arguing that this symbolized the beginning of colonial con trol of the Indian nation, which first manifested itself in the areas of religion and cul ture, and later moved on to making these arenas part of the state. 4Actually writing systems have a religious ideology behind them, and the thirty-five-let ter alphabet has its own associated mythology. When it comes to teaching the alpha bet to the common people, however, the thirty-five-letter is spoken of as linguistically accurate, and the twenty-seven-letter alphabet is described as relating to religion. 5For a detailed comparative linguistic analysis of the two orthographies, please see "Competing Ideologies, Competing Scripts: The Politics of Orthographic Choice in Northeastern India" by Shobhana Chelliah and Sohini Ray. 6The royal court of Manipur had a tradition of keeping a written chronicle that docu mented the events in the kingdom. This corpus, Cheitharol Kumbaba, is considered the most important source material for the history of Manipur. 7There are several sets of mythologies correlating the letters and the human body in Manipur. The thirty-five-letter alphabet also has a mythology about the letters coming out of the snake form of Pakhangba, the progenitor of the Meitei community. (For details refer to my dissertation titled "The Sacred Alphabet and the Divine Body: The Case of Meitei Mayek in Northeastern India.") Also, as in Tantric beliefs, in which there is a philosophical assumption about the letters coming out of the chakras, or the cen ters in the human, in Manipur there are also traces of a parallel mythology with letters coming out of the different centers of the body (See "Hakchanggi thambal," unpub lished manuscript by B. Kulachandra Sharma.) But during the orthographic debates, 152</page><page sequence="25">_SQHINI RAY none of these mythologies that support the thirty-five-letter alphabet were mentioned. During the debate the thirty-five-letter version of the orthography was argued to be lin guistically more accurate, since it resembles the other Sanskritic orthographies preva lent in India, and the twenty-seven-letter version was argued to be culturally authen tic, and no linguistic reasoning was given for it. 8T Maibi passed away recently. 9For a detailed account of Thang-ta and its associated religious practices, see Sohini Ray, "Thang-ta" in Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia, edited by Thomas Green Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Publishing. 10There is an extensive discussion of the letters of the alphabet and their ruling deities in the manuscript Mayek laishak khangba, but for the purposes of this article, I will limit the discussion to the oral interview. 11The battle of Khomjom in 1871 between the British and the king of Manipur is one of the landmarks of the history of Manipur, as it was at this time that Manipur became a princely state under the British Empire. 12The anthropomorphic form is held to be sacred in Indian Hinduism as well, but the Meitei interpretation of the anthropomorphic form seems different from the popular Hindu notion of seeing the divine, since it is interpreted through bodily practice as opposed to only anthropomorphic icons. 13Nandy's essay was written before the recent nuclear tests in India. But for the purpos es of this article, the rest holds true. 14l would argue here that Sharon Traweek makes the same observation when she dis cusses her fieldwork experience among scientists in the United States and Japan.
