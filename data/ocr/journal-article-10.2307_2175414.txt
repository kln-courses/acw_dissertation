Herr Jerusalem tells us that he has for a number of years been convinced that the nature of Judgment is a fundamental problem of</page><page sequence="2">No. 5.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 537 philosophy, and that its solution would contribute much toward a satisfactory metaphysical theory. " In Judgment we have before us a real principle of the cognitive activity, which is daily experienced by every one, and which is nevertheless of universal validity. If we can show that Judgment is the form which is developed in every man according to necessary psychological laws, and that this form must be applied to everything given to consciousness in order that this matter may really become a conscious content and mental possession, we shall thereby have approached the solution of metaphysical questions. The concepts ' God' and ' Mind' may receive new light, and it will also be easier to answer the question whether it is possible to prove the existence of a course of events which is independent of us, and beyond our consciousness "(pp. 34, 35 ). That the nature of Judgment is one of the central problems of philosophy is, of course, no new doctrine, since Kant pointed out that all the acts of the understanding can be reduced to this form of func- tioning. The author, however, claims that his method is superior to that of Kant, inasmuch as the latter deals with preempirical cate- gories which can never be found in experience, while his investigation is to stand on psychological ground and to use the method of psycho- logical analysis (p. 34). The introductory part of the work seems to promise that the logical function of Judgment is to be deduced and explained from a psychological analysis of the elements which enter into it. " Not until it has become clear by thorough psychological analysis of what known elements the act of Judgment is composed, and what relations obtain between it and other psychical processes, will the necessary basis be gained for the logical and epistemological meaning of our forms of thought " (p. 2). It will be impossible to dis- cuss this in detail, but the programme has not, I think, been carried through. The logical question (What does Judgment do?) is indeed introduced and answered in the sections which profess to analyze the Judgment process (pp. 78-96), but the necessary connection between the ideational, affective, and conative elements discovered by analysis, and the cognitive function which Judgment performs, are not made clear. The second division of the book (pp. 36-77) is devoted to an historical sketch of the various discussions of Judgment in ancient, mediaeval, and modern philosophy, including a section dealing with the theories of the most prominent writers of the present time. It is evident that in this brief compass only a very summary account of the various doctrines is possible. The author 's statements are,</page><page sequence="3">538 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. however, clear, and his criticisms acute. In dealing with the school of Brentano one cannot but feel that his judgments are harsh, and there is an animus displayed which is happily strange to philo- sophical criticism in this country. The references to Mr. Bradley, both in this chapter and later (p. i86), seem to show that the author has either read no further than the first chapter of The Principles of .Logic, or that for some reason he has failed to understand the former's position. Of Mr. Bosanquet's work he makes no mention. In the third and fourth divisions of the work, Ursjprung und Elemente der Urtheilsf nation, and En/wick/ung der Urtheilsfunction, we have the statement and development of the author's theory. What really takes place, Herr Jerusalem asks, when we make a simple judgment like ' The tree blooms'? The answer is that by means of the judgment the entire ideational complex is ordered and system- atized (wird geformt und gegliedert) in such a way that the tree is represented as a unitary being possessed of a force whose manifes- tation is the bloom. Along with this there goes what the English call 'belief,' and the school of Brentano 'Anerkennung.' The tree is represented as something existing independently of me, and so objectified as something beyond my idea of it (p. 82). But more, it is now regarded as a 'c entre of force,' as a being endowed with something analogous to a human will, of which the various attributes it exhibits, and the changes it undergoes, are the manifestations (p. 83). It is of the very nature of intelligence to be anthropomorphic, and the judgment always introjects into the content upon which it acts a 'centre of force,' or 'will,' to serve as its permanent unity and principle of explanation. This mode of explaining the actions of external things is derived from the immediate experience of the reciprocal connection between psychical and physical process ; that is, from the direct perception that all our movements are the result of our own will (p. 93). "The reciprocal connection of physical and psychical processes is the first and only form of Causality which we really experience " (p. 26i). In the section on the development of Judgment, the author proceeds to show that all the various kinds of judgments fulfil the same function and fall under the definition given above. The judgment, ' It will rain,' is equivalent to, " In the present condition of the weather there exists a tendency or inclination or will to rain" (p. I35). Even in hypothetical judgments this intro- jection of a will has not altogether disappeared. The whole discussion of Judgment is exceedingly suggestive, and the sections dealing with the relation of language to thinking are</page><page sequence="4">No. 5.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 539 especially helpful and instructive. It does not seem to me, however, that we have anything distinctively new in the theory here presented. That it is the function of Judgment to order and systematize the unanalyzed complex of perception into a world of known objects, is a doctrine which has been recognized by almost every one since the time of Kant. And that in performing this task Judgment always takes the form of Causality (which implies Substantiality) is no more than Schopenhauer maintained. Moreover, the view that this category only finds a meaning in our own volitional experiences, and necessarily leads us to interpret things as Wills, or centres of force, is scarcely a new doctrine to a reader of Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung. It is worth noting, also, that Schopenhauer is much better furnished with categories than Herr Jerusalem, for, in addition to Space and Time - about which the latter says nothing - his category of Causality has a ' fourfold root,' and provides for the lower categories in the princeipium rationis essendi, and for the higher in the principium rationis cognoscendi. The author's sole principle of ex- planation, on the other hand, seems to correspond to the ratioftendi, or principle of efficient causality. It does not seem to me evident that every judgment which expresses causal relation necessarily involves the conception of objects as ' forces' or ' wills.' I should rather say that such a mode of conceiving the relation is a psychological accident, which is depend- ent upon the vividness of the imagination of the person who judges, and is in no way essential to the nature of the judgment. But even if this point be not pressed, the theory fails to provide any place for judgments expressing simple Quality and Quantity, and still more obviously for judgments involving teleology. I should be quite willing to admit all that the author urges regarding the unavoidable anthropomorphism of our judging faculty. Hoomo mensura is the principle upon which all explanation of the world must proceed: to render intelligible what is given through sense perception is to find ourselves in it. But to order and systematize the material thus given as centres of force, or wills without purpose, is by no means to satisfy completely the demands or the possibilities of Judgment as a function of explanation or interpretation. Our intelligence demands that the real shall be exhibited as rational, and this demand is not fulfilled so long as we view it merely as the expression of force or purposeless volition. The application of the author's views to psychical phenomena carries with it some interesting conclusions. The fundamental</page><page sequence="5">540 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. V. characteristic which distinguishes psychical from physical phenomena is the complete lack of any substratum in the former. "Physical phenomena cannot be thought without a. substratum, psychical phenomena cannot be thought with one " (p. 9). However, in judg- ments regarding a mental process, there is always something which becomes the subject and is regarded as a permanent centre of force. This may sometimes be a bodily organ, sometimes a word which signifies a feeling or an emotion, sometimes the Ego itself (pp. i64- I67). We must distinguish, however, between psychical states as merely lived (erlebt), and as forming the material of a judgment. The first stage corresponds to consciousness, the second to self-conscious- ness (p. i67). When, moreover, we raise the question regarding the truth or falsity of judgments, the author finds that judgments regard- ing physical processes do correspond to a reality beyond conscious- ness, and are therefore true. This conclusion is supported by the fact that our predictions and judgments of expectation regarding the exter- nal world are actually confirmed by the course of events, and also by the agreement of our judgments with those of our fellows. There is, however, no such evidence for the truth of the judgments we pass upon psychological processes. Indeed, since, as we have seen, it is the very nature of Judgment to substantialize and objectify, we must regard such judgments as in a certain sense a falsification of the psychical fact as actually lived. " Every attempt must be made to eliminate the personification attaching to Judgment, and to emphasize the fact that we only wish to describe the process so that the hearer or reader may be able to reproduce it in himself, or recognize it again when he experiences it" (p. i96). " Every judgment about psychical phenomena is, strictly taken, a figurative mode of expression, and the real process never exactly corresponds to the judgment made regarding it. Whether the subject be denoted by the head or the heart, the Ego or the Soul, there is always reference to a permanent centre of force which can never be found in erlebten Vorgang " (p. 259). There- fore, the author concludes, " physical phenomena can be known only discursively, psychological phenomena only intuitively " (p. 260). Though this discussion is extremely interesting and has important bearings on the question regarding the proper procedure of psychology, the conclusion reached seems to me to depend upon the assumption that psychological processes are by their very nature destitute of any permanent centre or substance. To make judgments about them is to refer them to some kind of .substratum which can never be found im erlebten Vorgang, and therefore, the author concludes, to falsify</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 541 them. But would not the same argument hold of our judgments regarding physical phenomena? For, when Judgment ascribes various physical changes and processes to permanent centres of force, when it ' introjects,' to use the author's own word, a will into the presented phenomena, there is certainly involved a reference to a permanent subject which can never be found im erlebten Vorgang. In every judgment we have a process of interpretation which carries us beyond the given to some permanent principle which makes the given intel- ligible. If now this process yields truth when dealing with physical events, it is not clear why it should fail to correctly interpret the occurrences of the mental world. The theory of Judgment which we have been examining seems to the author to furnish the basis for a complete system of philosophy, and he promises to set forth its metaphysical, ethical, and sociological implications in a future work. Even in the treatment now before us, however, we are not left in doubt regarding the general character of that system. The author regards his theory of Judgment as leading directly to Dualism and Realism. It is curious to note that Idealism -to the refutation of which considerable space is devoted (pp. 222- 234)-is opposed to Realism as the doctrine that nothing exists apart from the individual consciousness. Idealism thus interpreted is then described as the hypertrophy of the cognitive impulse (die Hypertropzie des Erkenntnistriebes), continuance in which must lead to the destruc- tion of the organ of thought (p. 233). The same sentence is pro- nounced against Materialism and all other systems which attempt to reach a monistic view of the world by joining together what is funda- mentally different (p. 248). Nevertheless, so far as one is able to judge from the brief statement at the end of the book, the author himself is driven to Monism. We must conceive of the world as a whole, the totality of physical and psychical phenomena, he tells us, as the mani- festation of one all-ruling divine Will (p. 263). How this can be recon- ciled with the Dualism which has just been noticed I do not know. It will doubtless be wise to await the completer exposition promised in the forthcoming philosophical work. J.
