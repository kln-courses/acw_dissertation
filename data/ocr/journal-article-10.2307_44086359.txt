<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Outka (De) composing Whitman Ecocriticism hasn't paid much sustained attention to Whitman, certainly not compared with his transcendentalist contemporaries Thoreau and Emerson.1 Despite Whitman's manifest love of the American natural landscape, he spent almost all his life in cities; he was, as he said, "of Manhattan the son." And, as a result, the vision of the natural world his poetry offers has a particularly urban and queer character- dynamic and charged with erotic possibility, it stresses multiplicity, mobility, and intimate contact.2 No sooner are we "leaning and loafeing at [our] ease observing a spear of summer grass," at the beginning of "Song of Myself," but we're almost immediately roused, "naked," off to the "bank by the wood." Nature writers generally tell us what nature is like, lend us their keen eye for detail and nuance, their ability to concentrate, to pause, be still, see, know, tell. Whitman, however, characteristically moves quickly through a range of different stances toward nature in his writing, from close observation, to anthropocentric interpretation, to an uncanny organic materialism, and back again, a circuit that is generally meant to produce pleasure, anguish, or beauty, rather than knowledge. Whitman's nature is inherently transitional, an ongoing, restless circulation through a variety of possible definitions. Put another way, our neglect of Whitman is arguably symptomatic of our commitment to defining what nature is, the sort of knowledge that traditionally comes from the naturalist's patient observation. Whitman's restlessness makes such knowledge difficult if not impossible; and in fact such knowledge itself poses a potential threat to Whitman's restless movement. Consider, for example, the following journal entry Whit- man composed late in life: Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 12.1 (Winter 2005) Copyright © 2005 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">42 ISLE Home again; down temporarily in the Jersey woods. Between 8 and 9 A.M. a full concert of birds, from different quarters, in keeping with the fresh scent, the peace, the naturalness all around me. I am lately noticing the russet-back, size of the robin or a trifle less, light breast and shoulders, with irregular dark stripes- tail long- sits hunch'd up by the hour these days, top of a tall bush, or some tree, singing blithely. I often get near and listen, as he seems tame; I like to watch the work- ing of his bill and throat, the quaint sidle of his body, and flex of his long tail. I hear the wood-pecker, and night and early morning the shuttle of the whip-poor-will- noons, the gurgle of thrush delicious, and meo-o-oow of the cat-bird. Many I cannot name; but I do not very particularly seek information. (You must not know too much, or be too precise or scientific about birds and trees and flowers and water-craft; a certain free margin, and even vagueness- perhaps ignorance, cre- dulity-helps your enjoyment of these things, and of the sentiment of feather'd, wooded, river, or marine Nature generally. I repeat it- don't want to know too exactly, or the reasons why. My own notes have been written off-hand in the latitude of middle New Jersey. Though they describe what I saw- what appeared to me- I dare say the expert ornithologist, botanist or entomologist will detect more than one slip in them.)3 (904-05) Whitman begins by observing the russet-back's behavior closely, but then wanders off, replacing the bird in its particularity with poeticized descriptions of bird songs ("night and early morning the shuttle of the whip-poor-will, the gurgle of thrush delicious"). The paragraph moves from a focus on particular detail to an anthropomorphized (the cat bird goes meow!), constructed, and quite lovely "enjoyment of these things and of the sentiment of feather'd, wooded, river, or marine Nature generally." This pleasure depends, Whitman claims, on an active refusal to know ("I don't want to know too exactly, or the reasons why"). He doesn't turn, as one might expect, his delighted observation of the russet-back into a template for observing other birds or into an opportunity to instruct the reader. Instead, Whitman pushes against the knowledge he has gained, favoring instead "ignorance," "vagueness," "credulity." The final lines neatly summarize the tension Whitman feels between the authority of scientific classification and poetic "enjoyment" as he deftly, if not waggishly, counterpoises his "off-hand" experience (what he "saw- what appeared to [him]") with the supposedly more authoritative judgment of the "expert ornitholo- gist, botanist, or entomologist" ready to "detect" a "slip" in the details of Whitman's observations. But the whole passage, of course, embraces "slippage" more than "detection."4 Whitman is doing something more subtle here than rejecting scien- tific "dull realities" in favor of a naturalized, narcissistic romanticism</page><page sequence="3">(De) composing Whitman 43 (though he is doing that).5 Rather than a simple juxtaposition between cold classificatory knowledge and intimate poeticized experience, Whit- man offers a carefully qualified ambiguity.6 He calls for "a certain free margin. . . even vagueness. . .perhaps ignorance, credulity," does not " very particularly seek information," does not want to "know too much" or " too exactly," or be " too precise or scientific." He neither rejects "infor- mation" entirely, nor embraces "enjoyment" utterly, but calls for some inherently unclear and changing mixture of both. It is this shifting, uncertain blend of a variety of multiple natural discourses that com- poses Whitman's "certain free margin"- an existent but unmapped territory of intersecting constructions, all of which can be proffered because none of them has final authority. It is here that we begin to see how useful Whitman might be to cur- rent green critical discourse. For far from serving its traditional role as some ahistorical source of Truth or Value, the reference of "nature" has become as contentious an issue as any in contemporary ecocriticism. At the core of the debate lies the fundamental contradiction that "nature" is both a construct and isn't, that the term refers at once to a product of human culture and language and to an unknowable realm outside of any text. As Laurence Buell declares succinctly, our representations of nature must have "a dual accountability to matter and to discursive mentation" ( Environmental Imagination 92). While I think only the naïve believe in the possibility of an entirely unmediated or Absolute experi- ence of nature, and only the most anthropocentric theoretical idealists would deny nature's independent existence altogether, debates over whether we should emphasize nature's constructedness or givenness, or how we might (or if we can) reconcile or ameliorate the division between our constructs and the independent, nonhuman world has divided green studies for some time.7 In the "free margin," Whitman moves gracefully through a range of possible "natures" while fundamentally acknowledging the in- completeness of each one's definition. Rather than seeing "nature" as exclusively referring to either text or language or some fixed ratio between them, Whitman offers us a continuum of reference bounded by textuality and "pure" Otherness, where we roam, rather than fix on and defend a particular position. Every definition of nature is "right" under this model, as long as it falls within those boundaries and in- corporates, at least in some shifting ratio, a recognition of both poles. Indeed, Whitman's stance permits us to sidestep the whole contentious notion of "right" altogether, and instead ask pragmatic and creative questions about what part of this free margin suits our purposes best, what area is the most interesting or useful one to move through, what</page><page sequence="4">44 ISLE provides the most intellectually engaging, aesthetically pleasing, and/or politically effective characterization of "nature."8 Rather than worrying about parsing precisely what nature is or isn't, spatializing the meanings of the word "nature" invites us instead to stress the imaginative possibilities afforded by mobility, transition, and multiple contact. Each position in this free margin is connected to, and contextualized by, a potentially infinite number of other po- sitions, other ways of understanding the mix of story and fact that also describe "right" understandings of nature. The authority of our textual constructions remains real, but local; the authority of the extra- textual materiality of nature is limited by the fact that it is accessible only through such local textual constructions. The point is neither to descend into mere textual play where the "nature" reference ceases to matter materially, nor to aspire to rise out of our constructions to an essentialized authority, but to circulate, as Whitman does, through a variety of definitions in a way that provides pleasure, interest, insight, and that offers new bases for critique and action. While Whitman has a great deal to offer ecocriticism, the reverse is also true; Whitman critics have often folded Whitman's nature writ- ing into a symbol of his cosmic ego, his sexuality, his other political and cultural concerns.9 Indeed, Whitman's nature is often treated as a symbol of everything except nature. And yet the "grass" that titles Whitman's book and that serves as his central poetic symbol, clearly represents both text and nature. Consider his first attempt to describe its meaning in "Song of Myself," an extremely well-known passage that an ecocritical approach allows us to read afresh: A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands How could I answer the child? .... I do not know what it is any more than he. I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven. Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped, Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose? Or I guess the grass is itself a child .... the produced babe of the vegetation. Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, Growing among black folks as among white,</page><page sequence="5">(De)composing Whitman 45 Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive from them the same. (31) The child's question- "what is the grass?"- is a question both about the meaning of Whitman's poem and about the meaning of grass itself, Whitman's central, ubiquitous, and shifting symbol for both his poetry and the natural world. The point is not to choose whether Whitman is "really" writing about his poem or the natural world but to note how Whitman conjoins the meaning of both. The answers that follow the child's question- or the lack thereof- go to the very center of the way Whitman conceived the relation between textuality and the landscape. Whitman's first "answer" is, characteristically, a dodge, a refusal to define the meaning of the grass "too precisely." He declares: "How could I answer the child? .... I do not know what it is any more than he." Here, from the start, the grass forms another version of the free margin, a foregrounded uncertainty built into the attempt at natural description. And as we saw with the journal entry, this uncertainty frees Whitman to move through a variety of possible definitions of the natural. His chant-like repetition of "Or I guess," followed by enor- mously complex and beautiful images that don't clearly connect to one another, has the effect of at once engaging the reader on an aesthetic and emotional level, while leaving our analytic abilities further and further behind. Like Whitman himself, the destabilized reader cannot, at least immediately, quantify the grass, cannot codify its meaning in concrete language. Rather than clarifying just what nature/poetry/identity is here, Whitman's catalogue provides a series of definitions of the natural through which the reader moves, each definition accurate, incomplete, and interconnected- a sort of linguistic ecosystem. Whitman's first attempt to define the grass- "I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven"- blends na- tional, ecological, and personal identities. The grass is a "flag," a symbol of national identity. But its unadorned green color refuses even the symbolic "writing" most national flags contain, such as the American flag's Stars and Stripes. Walt's green flag subtly refigures the country as countryside. And this conjunction of nation and natural is in turn folded into the speaker's own identity, this is "the flag of [his] disposi- tion," woven of "hopeful green stuff." The next "guess" expands the scope of his unsettlement further, traversing a second historically and politically resonant understanding of nature, one central to American identity from the Puritans onward- the landscape as a sign of God's handiwork. Walt shifts from seeing the grass as a reflection of the hu- man, offering instead the possibility that the grass, "is the handkerchief</page><page sequence="6">46 ISLE of the Lord, / A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped, / Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?" The significance of the grass suddenly changes from a personal to a metaphysical, even theological, frame of reference here. In making this shift, Whitman takes on one of the most entrenched and static definitions of nature available- nature as the sign of the divine. Although Whitman is certainly playing with the traditional trope of the Great Chain of Being, he's only playing. Nature here is represented as divine flirtation rather than an opportunity for scholastic proof; the grass becomes the "scented" and endlessly repeated name of God, a startling, lovely, and profoundly ambiguous "guess." The possibility of an Absolute valuation of nature is proffered, but with a wink rather than judgment or a ponderous mysticism. Slipping again, Walt next guesses that "the grass is itself a child . . . . the produced babe of the vegetation." This guess intertwines those that have come before, summarizing them in a way that produces a meaning different from the sum of its symbolic parts. Here, rather than forming the "hopeful green flag" of Walt's "disposition," the grass itself becomes a child, one metaphorically linked to the child/reader that asked the initial question. Again, the constitutive links between Walt and the reader are emphasized; both of us are constructed of, and by, this mysterious grass. And instead of merely serving as a sign of God's presence (i.e., as "the handkerchief of the Lord"), the grass becomes the "babe" of a vegetative creator-god, a questioning presence like Walt or the reader. The previous stresses on the reader, Walt, and God, are dislocated from each of those individual figures, and combined into this new child that is at once all three of the earlier guesses, and something in its own right. So what is the grass? Whitman's final guess, that "it is a uniform hieroglyphic" returns the discussion to its starting place, decreating the earlier figures, returning them back to the primordial poetic lan- guage of which they are, literally, composed. These figures- and by extension, Walt, his readers, even God Herself- are constructions of a mysterious "hieroglyphic" language. It is as if the linguistic material of the poem itself speaks at this moment, folding the author, the reader, and the divine into itself, blurring the borders of the text and of the selves that occupy, speak, and are ultimately spoken by, that text. The grass's language is a "uniform hieroglyphic ," a sign that occupies a space between the abstraction of alphabetic words, and a simple pictorial rep- resentation of the signified.10 On the border between abstract language and the world, between nature as linguistic construction and nature as unspeakable, unconstructed material Other, the hieroglyphic grass is both "in and out of the game" of language, interpenetrating the human</page><page sequence="7">(De)composing Whitman 47 and the natural through the medium of the poem. The hieroglyph does not represent anything specific; it is both "uniform," a single, endlessly repeated sign, but a sign that represents transitional activity rather than a concrete object of perception: "And it [the grass as hieroglyph] means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, / Growing among black folks as among white, / Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same I receive them the same." Especially in 1855, for the hieroglyph/grass to " mean " "sprouting alike..." or "growing among. . ." is to undo definition as much as to specify it, to understand the grass lecosystemically, as an interconnecting green force that joins what is separate, that undoes the rigid human constructions of race and place that brought the nation to civil war. Whitman's grass greens the free margin. * * * The primordial decreating process I just noted parallels the larger natural processes that grip all of us, that constitute and determine our own material- and not merely textual- natures. The body, like nature- as nature- is a text. But, like nature, the body is also not simply textual; it is also extra-linguistic and mortal, a manifestation of the same natural materiality it purports to observe and construct. This recogni- tion is at the base of Whitman's conclusion of his catalogue of the grass's definition: "And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves" (31). The grass, finally, becomes not only a kind of organic tombstone, symbolizing an absent figure, the last "word" of someone's life, but a language spoken by nature to describe us. Unlike a tombstone, the grass is intimately connected to the corpse it marks, it "transpires from the breasts of young men," it not only represents "offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps," "here [it is] the mothers' laps." The grass "speaks" the corpse using the "language" of the natural world: O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues! And I perceive that they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing. I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps. (32) The grass here becomes an infinite number of "uttering tongues," a language Whitman can "perceive" but not "translate." The speaking self becomes the material body, which becomes the corpse, which</page><page sequence="8">48 ISLE merges with the landscape, fertilizing the grass that in turn "speaks" of the grave it springs from, and references the text of Whitman's book in which this circuit of transformation from text to material and back again takes place. The final connective task of the grass is to undo the distinction between the living and the dead, a radical decentering of the anthropomorphic that aligns Whitman here with the deep ecologi- cal view of the human as very much a subset of the larger biotic com- munity. Whitman's texts are embodied and his bodies are textualized, a parallel that intersects with a similar dynamic in the larger natural landscape at the point of the body's decomposition. This cycling links Whitman's understanding of nature's shifting definitions to his understanding of human identity, breaking down the anthropocentric distinction between human and natural not only in the familiar move of seeing nature and the body as text, but in seeing the natural and bodily texts as material. To move unidirectionally from the fact of the body's materiality to its textual signification is to make the same mistake as choosing between nature as pure essence and nature as textual construct. In both cases, the disjunction between the observing critical consciousness and the physical world is maintained, and the constructive primacy of the former is upheld at the expense of the latter. What ecocriticism loses in the process is the radical, material similarity between body and land. As Deborah Slicer notes in "The Body as Bioregion:" The only bioregion that we can claim strict identity with is the body. A human body is sixty electrical jolts a minute, at rest: twenty-five feet of gut, containing a virtual hothouse of microbes, each with its own diet; ninety square yards of alveoli, all performing the elegant exchange of oxygen and carbon; a mind that blips continuously up and down an eighteen-inch rope of salty brain-stuff the thickness of a man's finger. To be "home" is first to inhabit one's own body. We are each, as a body, a biological ecosystem as complex, efficient, and as fragile as the Brooks Range, the Everglades, a native prairie. Most environmentalists, including the bioregionalists, have little to say about the body. . .. While I want to acknowledge the profound influence of cultural inscriptions on the body, I do not want to abandon the body to a noumenal realm that is culture.... Inundated by discourses that reduce the body to a political cipher or "swaddle" her in culture, I wish to put in a word for the organism. The environmentalists' silence about the body is all too familiar. My worry is that this silence reflects that traditional and dangerous way of thinking that the body is of no consequence, that our own corpo-</page><page sequence="9">(De)composing Whitman 49 real nature is irrelevant to whatever the environmentalists are calling "Nature." (113-14) Slicer's call here echoes Whitman's much earlier and poetically formative declaration in the 1855 Preface to Leaves of Grass that the landscape is textual- "the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem" (5)- and that the poet is the landscape, an expression of the national geography: "His spirit responds to his country's spirit. ... he incarnates its geography and natural life and rivers and lakes. [. . .] When the long Atlantic coast stretches longer he easily stretches with them north or south. He spans between them also from east to west and reflects what is between them" (7). This ideal American poet is interpenetrated not only by history and contemporary society, "he" [sic] at once "incarnates" the country's "geography and natural life and rivers and lakes" in poetry, and is himself the poetic incarnation of that geography- simultaneously speaking the landscape and being spoken by it. Indeed, occupying this liminal position between land and text is, for Whitman, the central role of the poet. The so-called "American bard's" poetic authority lies not in an esoteric modernist knowledge, nor in more traditional Romantic terms as a special sensitivity to natural beauty, but rather in his ability to communicate, in language, a preexisting, prelingual connection between human beings and the natural world: The land and sea, the animals fishes and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the forests mountains and rivers are not small themes . . . but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objects .... [T]hey expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well enough . . probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons, drivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old and varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty and of a residence of the poetic in outdoor people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive . . . some may but they never can. The poetic qual- ity is not marshaled in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops the seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of unifor- mity that it coveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or</page><page sequence="10">50 ISLE orations or recitations are not independent but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. (10-11) Whitman's conception of poetic beauty is not simply rooted in the author, the text, or in nature, but in the cycling between them- it is communicative, transitive, a response by the "beautiful blood and [. . .] brain" of the reader/viewer. His poetry not only reproduces "the land and sea, the animals fishes and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the forests mountains and rivers," in all the "beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objects" but "indicates" a two-way path between this "reality" and the "soul." This poetic indication is itself half constructed, half natural- budding not from the poet's sublime brain nor from free wilderness, but from cultivated plants, from lilacs, roses, chestnuts, oranges, melons, and pears.11 As Emerson does in Nature , Whitman insists that our perception of outer natural beauty is a perception of the same thing inside us. But unlike Emerson, Whitman understands this "something inside" not as an immaterial essence, but as material: "blood" and "brains," real objects made of the same stuff as the animals and geographic features he lists at the begin- ning of the paragraph. Just as the American bard must "incarnate" the American landscape, so too the identity of his readers is here situated in the physical rather than- or not simply in- the mental or spiritual realms. Whitman insists on a fundamental, material, and constitutive similarity between ourselves and the world around us. But there's an important difference between people and the world, an alienation just as paradoxically primary as the similarity. Put simply, although we're "real objects," we aren't " dumb real objects." We can speak, write, read; we know ourselves, others, and the world only through language. Although Whitman often expresses deep admiration for the unselfconscious existence of animals, for example, he never denies the mediated nature of our existence, never offers us a sham transcendence of the linguistic. The bard's role is to "indicate the path between reality and... [the] soul," both to translate the landscape into language, and to assert the material connection between "blood," "brain," the American landscape and "beauty." Whitman both wants to break out of language into the "real world," and to "translate" that world- the landscape, people, animals, himself- back into language. Here again we see a version of the strange double parallel that emerged at the end of the "What is the grass" passage, and that springs, I think, from the profound ambiguity of the free margin: just as the body is radically part of the physical world, Walt, Whitman's written self, is con- stitutively the same as the written world he creates and inhabits- flesh is to land as character is to text.</page><page sequence="11">(De)composing Whitman 51 And yet, however beautifully imagined, nature doesn't "speak" except when we do, except as us. A few years later, in the 1860 poem "As I Ebb'd With the Ocean of Life" Whitman confronts this fact, con- fronts his (and our) inevitable failure to translate the grass's "hints," the impossibility of poetically bridging the gap- or, indeed, healing the rift- between the textual and the nontextual natural. 0 baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth, Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth, Aware now that amid all the blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am, But that before all my arrogant poems, the real Me stands yet untouch'd untold, altogether unreach'd, Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows, With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written, Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath. 1 perceive that I have not really understood anything, not a single object, and that no man ever can, Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon and sting me, Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all. (395) Despite the despondent tone, Whitman's fundamental under- standing of the relationship between human identity, beauty, and the natural world retains deep similarities with the 1855 Preface. What is an external role in the Preface- the American bard- and an external object- the grass- in "Song of Myself," here is characterized as an in- ternal structure, a True, unspoken self, but one linked explicitly to the very American geography that in part constitutes- "incarnates"- those earlier figures. Whitman here characterizes his poetic failure as an in- ability to "touch," "tell," or "reach" what he calls the "real Me." But this failure is not simply internal, an inability to translate some unique psy- chological essence into poetry. The "real Me" doesn't point to Whitman after "pointing in silence" to his "songs," it points to " the sand beneath!' Whitman's "real" identity here seems as connected to the beach sand as it is to his own physical form; indeed, in the final stanza, "nature" takes the place of the real Me's mocking laughter, "darting upon" and "stinging" the poet. Whitman may be, as he says in "Song of Myself," "not contained between his hat and boots," but that does not imply a transcendence of the physical; Whitman does not fault his poetry here for failing to soar to some ethereal realm above the earth. Rather, Whitman faults his poetry for not doing justice to the deep, constitutive</page><page sequence="12">52 ISLE links between the "real Me" and the natural setting; for his feeling that he has "not really understood anything, not a single object." This failure, he's right to point out, is not his alone; indeed, as I have argued, it is an inevitable failure. All our texts fail to "understand" na- ture, to represent it without constructing it. For Whitman, this failure to "understand" is explicitly connected to the real Me's silent accusa- tory pointing to his "songs;" to understand would be to sing the beach successfully. Just as Whitman physically occupies a liminal zone- yet another free margin- between land and sea as he walks along a trail of debris left by the ebb tide, so too here Whitman seems trapped be- tween his linguistic constructs of the world and the frustrating feeling of a world existing external to those constructs, a world that he can only understand in and through a medium- language- that is itself the source of the alienation that first sets his desire to understand in motion. And given Whitman's conception of the self as formed out of the landscape, the external division between poet and nature mir- rors a similar internal division between his linguistic and "real" or bodily selves. The real Me brilliantly captures this anguished double dichotomy; constructed by the language of the poem, it does not speak, but points in silence , a representation of a gesture outside of the word. Whitman's crucial deixis here underscores his twin, contradictory, commitments to textuality- the possibility of translating himself and the landscape into poetry- and his often anguished insistence that what is most important, the materiality of nature and the body, remains outside the text, unsaid and unsayable.12 Whitman, of course, can't resolve this paradoxical double commit- ment to textuality and the nonrhuman landscape that is constitutive of any environmentally concerned writing. He can only move on to another definition. The free margin does not offer stable definition or resolution. What we say about nature isn't what it "really" is- but it's a part, and it's all we have anyway, at least until our final, permanent, (re)union with the landscape outside of the text. Indeed, death is the only possible resolution. The very attempt to imagine nature as it "re- ally is," in itself, outside of language, perhaps inevitably devolves into a meditation on our own mortality- one reason for our shameful treat- ment of the environment, our insistence on our linguistically marked difference from nature, is, perhaps, because we're so unhappy about, angry over, afraid of that final return. As Buell notes, "Sooner or later, the implacable thereness of the external world is found to represent the adversary. No matter how resolutely cheerful or stoic one's tempera- ment, in some moods or phases nature will metamorphose from pos- sibility into fate" ( Environmental Imagination 111).</page><page sequence="13">(De)composing Whitman 53 And so rather than the grass's "uttering tongues" proving that "there really is no death," this poem ends with nature speaking an endless elegy for the dead: Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,) Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother, Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me, Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you. I mean tenderly by you and all, I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead, and following me and mine. Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses, Froth, snowy white, and bubbles, (See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, See the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,) Tufts of straw, sands, fragments, Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another, From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, swell, Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil, Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thown, A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature, Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets, We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you, You up there walking or sitting, Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet. (396) Yet, despite the real despair of this poem about poetry's possi- bilities and the radical alienation between the human and the natural that our language helplessly imposes, there's a slip even here, in the uncanny lines where he imagines himself dead: "(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, / See the prismatic colors glistening and rolling)." Here, I would argue, for a moment, Whitman bridges the gap between poet and landscape, or at least successfully imagines the possibility of speaking not about nature, but as nature, of writing a poem that would satisfy the demands of the Real Me. Just as the Real Me "points in silence," earlier in the poem, here the mouth of the dead Whitman utters not words that represent the landscape, but "exudes" the landscape itself, a physical speech like the grass's uttering tongues that comes only at the highest price. But in paying it here, in</page><page sequence="14">54 ISLE imagining his own death and his rotting corpse, in aligning himself not with resurrection but with the ecosystem, he speaks, "at last," for a moment the earth's poetry, transforming his putrid ooze into "pris- matic colors glistening and rolling." Rather than the smallest sprout showing there is no death, here death is embraced, accepted, but as a return, not simply an end. The corpse doesn't go away- as we expect garbage to do today- but becomes the very stuff of the landscape, the debris that litters the shore. Our linguistic experiences of nature may be constructed, but that doesn't change the facts about where we spring from, what we depend upon, and where we end up. We are the part of the earth that learned to speak, nature's best trick, but that does not create a human realm separate from the natural, a separation key to our unsustainable lifestyle eager to "balance" environmental and "other" concerns. There's only one place and we are an expression of it- Whitman offers us this. I would argue that this realization- that rather than simply con- structing nature linguistically, we are constructed by it and of it- if deeply felt is a vital one in developing our environmental conscious- ness. For Whitman's restless nature, the interconnections between language, corpse, and landscape that I have noted both describe and depend upon a healthy ecosystem. I want to turn finally to a rare mo- ment in Whitman when the poetic, erotic, and chemical interchanges between earth and poet that comprise the free margin are threatened. The poem, published as "This Compost" (it was originally entitled "Poem of the Resurrection of the Wheat"), offers a profoundly disturb- ing and prescient understanding of the consequences of a disruption in the (de)compositional cycle. I quote it in its entirety since it is rarely anthologized and its force, I think, comes in the cumulative impact of its imagery: I. Something startles me where I thought I was safest, I withdraw from the still woods I loved, I will not go now on the pastures to walk, I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea, I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me. O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken? How can you be alive you growths of spring? How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain? Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you? Is not every continent worked over and over with sour dead? Where have you disposed of their carcasses?</page><page sequence="15">(Decomposing Whitman 55 Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations? Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat? I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd, I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through the sod and turn it up underneath, I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat. 2. Behold this compost! behold it well! Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person- yet behold! The grass of spring covers the prairies, The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden, The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward, The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches, The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves, The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree, The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on their nests, The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs, The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the colt from the mare, Out of its little hill rise the potato's dark green leaves, Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in the dooryards, The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead. What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious, That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous after me, That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues, That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it, That all is clean forever and forever, That the cool drink from the well tastes so good, That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy, That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that melon, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me, That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease, Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a catching disease. Now I am terrified of the Earth, it is that calm and patient, It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,</page><page sequence="16">56 ISLE It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions of diseas'd corpses, It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor, It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops, It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them at last. (495-97) What "startles" Whitman where he thought he was "safest" and in- terrupts the erotic communion with the natural world that "Song of Myself," among other poems, depends on, is, I think, a proto-toxic consciousness. The horror of the first section's vision of the soil as a thin covering for "foul liquid and meat," the visceral, disgusting way that Whitman forces his readers to share his nightmare vision of the earth refusing our waste, refusing to "translate the dead young men and women" into grass, speech, beauty, abundance, foreshadows in an uncanny way our contemporary fears of ecological disaster, of a poisoned earth, one that refuses to grow "sweet things" out of "such cor- ruptions," that no longer turns "harmless and stainless," whose "divine materials" are exhausted, that no longer "accepts such leavings." But for Whitman, the foul liquid and meat of the corpse can be, be- lievably, thrillingly, disconcertingly transformed both poetically and chemically into the "transparent green-wash of the sea," the "cool well water," the "flavourous and juicy blackberry," the fruits of the organic orchard. Whitman is "safe" because the circuit from corpse to poetry travels through the transformative filter of a healthy, ahuman earth. Decomposition is, or should be, linked to composition, in language and on the planet- this is the final meaning and promise of the free mar- gin. For us, conversely, the threats are more pervasive, more insidious, more abstract- dioxin, PCBs, MTBE, arsenic, and so on lurk beneath our grass. Love Canal has replaced the graveyard. Environmental degradation is itself a form of nature writing, both a human text and an essential, anti-human Other- and we have been busy writing in the 150 years since Whitman's poem. Rather than forming a free margin of possible meaning, our toxins fuse constructivism and essentialism in a definition of nature that threatens to conjoin artificiality and per- manence. And so the elegiac anxiety that haunts sensitive readers of "This Compost" in 2004 marks our modernity. We no longer fear the earth- the old sublime- we fear for it, fear ourselves on its behalf.</page><page sequence="17">(De) composing Whitman 57 NOTES 1. For example, only one article focusing on Whitman (on his prose work Specimen Days , not his poetry) has been published in the history of ISLE: In- terdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment , the ecocritical journal of record- see Major. Whitman appears on only one page in the authoritative Glotfelty collection, and Buell makes several intriguing, but only passing, refer- ences to him in his monumental Environmental Imagination. Moreover, very few articles examining Whitman from an ecocritical approach have been published in the last fifteen years, and almost all focus on Specimen Days (Philippon and Cummings are notable, and very worthwhile examples of this prose focus). See Warren ("Contexts") for a rare example of ecocritical analysis that examines Whitman's poetry. My own willingness to explore Whitman and ecocriticism was bolstered by the astute and generous comments I received from my colleagues Gretchen Legier and Daniel Gunn, and my wife Uma Outka. I could not have received better help; the essay's flaws are my own. 2. Buell's more recent Writing for an Endangered World addresses Whitman as an urban nature writer (see 90-109 in particular). Buell's study engages Whitman's fluid self-creation in a metropolitan context; my interest in much of what follows is in how Whitman's urban viewpoint constructs nature outside of the context of the city. 3. All Whitman quotations are taken from Kaplan's edition. 4. Buell notes, again in passing, Whitman's generally accurate and sympa- thetic observations of birds, especially in "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" (Environmental Imagination 7), and his conversations with Burroughs about the hermit thrush that plays such an important role in "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" (490, footnote 21). For additional information on Whitman's influence on Burroughs, see Warren "Whitman Land" and Renehan. In general, Whitman was both well-informed about the important scientific developments of his day and eagerly incorporated them in his poetry. For more on Whitman's scientific knowledge, Beaver remains important. See also Aarnes, and Reynolds, especially (235-78). Of particular interest for this article is Reynolds' discussion of Whitman's great interest in the then-new theories of Justus Liebig, the Ger- man founder of agricultural chemistry. Liebig studied the decomposition of human and animal corpses, analyzing the chemical process of decomposition and transformation into sources of new life (240-42). 5. In referencing Poe's "To Science" here, I don't mean to imply that his poem simply rehearses this opposition either. Poe's poem is, however, built on a conflict between the discourses of science and the mythic imagination that leaves out the redemptive possibility of an extra-human natural world. He wants his "dream beneath the tamarind tree" and could care less, I think, about the tree itself. 6. See Aames for a valuable analysis of the "free margin" in Whitman's writing. Although Aarnes does not address ecological issues directly, his work remains important for this article. Aarnes argues that Whitman assumed an identity with the physical world, evidenced uneasily in his attempts to incor- porate German idealism into his work, and more successfully "when he ap-</page><page sequence="18">58 ISLE proaches the mystery of identity with the freedom of an amateur naturalist" (244). 7. This debate between nature essentialists and nature constructivists mir- rors a similar debate in feminism, studies of race, gender, and sexuality, and other criticism interested in identity, as Mazel, among others, notes. Mazel adopts a thoroughgoing poststructuralist approach to nature throughout his book; see especially xi-xxv and 59-92 for a stimulating attempt to bring Judith Butler's theories of embodiment and performity to bear on the construction of nature. In addition to Mazel, other important constructivist approaches include Cronon, and the more recent Branch, Tallmadge, and Herzogenrath collections. A more essentialist emphasis can be found in the Soule collection, which offers a variety of often quite nuanced defenses of nature as including an extra-textual and ahuman element. The deep ecology movement (see especially Devall) also often rejects poststructualist approaches as anthropocentric. Leopold's classic argument in "The Land Ethic" (201-26) and Nash's history also argue for treat- ing nature as having intrinsic and extra-human value. Regardless of which emphasis I have assigned them, most of these accounts blend a sense of nature as text with a sense of it being also an independent existent with claims and rights of its own. I believe it is both things, of course; an argument for one or the other side, or for a particularly fixed ratio between them seems unfruitful to me. See Levin for an important statement on the need for such a combination. Along these lines I also particularly admire the Gaard ecofeminism collection, Buell (especially his call for "aesthetics of duel accountability" discussed from 83-114 in Environmental Imagination) and both Everndan books. 8. This approach largely gives up on the notion of truth as corresponding to a fixed reality "out there" that we discover, and instead, as Richard Rorty and others in the American pragmatic tradition urge, understands truth as some- thing made rather than found, a way of talking that works to accomplish ends for which we must take personal, rather than purely "objective" responsibility. In the Rortian sense including a Whitmanian free margin in all our descriptions of nature "builds in" the possibility of changing those descriptions, of engag- ing in a different conversation. (Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity discusses this notion in a particularly engaging way.) At the same time, however, the truths we make are, in Hayles' sense of the word "constrained" by material fact and physical laws; it won't do, as she points out, to construct a version of the natural world in which, say, gravity doesn't apply. 9. Which is not to say, of course, that such approaches are not worthwhile and valid- just that they're not the whole story. I do, however, appreciate Buell's irritation at how "literary theory has been making the idea of literature devoted to recuperating the factical environment seem quaintly untheoretical" (Environmental Imagination 86). He goes on to claim that "all major strains of contemporary literary theory have marginalized literature's referential dimen- sion by privileging structure text(tuality), ideology, or some other conceptual matrix that defines the space discourse occupies part from factical 'reality,'" and offers a well-chosen (if rare) Whitman example to prove his point: "Whitman, in 'Song of Myself,' may insist that 'I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass,' but there is no grass, no summer, no loafer (despite the</page><page sequence="19">(De)composing Whitman 59 title-page illustration done from a photograph of Whitman himself). No, there is only an image, a symbol, a projection, a personal, a vestige or democratic deformation of aristocratic pastoral (compare Thomas Gray's 'disporting on the margent green'), a contortion of heptameter" (86). 10. For more on the influence of Egypt and hieroglyphic language, see Irwin's study. 11. Steve Cushman taught me this and much else about Whitman in a seminar I had the good fortune to take with him in graduate school at the University of Virginia. 12. Howarth distinguishes deixis from mimesis and sees the former as central to ecocriticism: "Ecocriticism, instead of taxing science for its use of language to represent (mimesis), examines its ability to point (deixis) [...]. [D]eixis locate[s] entities in space, time, and social context. Through deixis, meaning develops from what is said or signed relative to physical space: I-you, here-there, this-that. Common as air or water, deixis expresses relative direction and orientation [...]" (80). REFERENCES Aarnes, William. '"Free Margins': Identity and Silence in Whitman's Specimen Days."
