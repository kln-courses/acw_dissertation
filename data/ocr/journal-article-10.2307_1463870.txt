<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion, XLVII/3, 417-427 Ezekiel's Vision Seen Through the Eyes of a Philosophic Mystic David R. Blumenthal ABSTRACT The stunning vision which Ezekiel reported having seen (Chapter One) gave rise to many interpretations, some attempting to explain the vision itself and some re-interpreting the vision in new and different terms. This article traces such a re-interpretation from the pen of Hoter ben Shelomo, a Jewish fifteenth-century savant from Yemen. Hoter began by rejecting the anthropomorphisms of the vision. This forced him into a symbolic interpretation in which he construed the text as a revelation of the structure of the cosmos as follows: the figure on the Throne, which is electrum from its waist upwards and fire from its waist downwards, represented the Agent Intelligence and the Universal Soul, respectively, yet taken together; the sapphire Throne represented the first Prime-Matter (the substrate of the supernal spheres); the firmament of awesome ice represented the outermost sphere. The Hayyot represented the other supernal spheres; the wings, faces, and facets representing the sum of natural causes the emanate from the spheres while the other parts of the body represented other aspects of the spheres such as their roundness, purity, and perfect motion. Finally, the Wheels represented the (spheres of the) elements. By integrating Ezekiel's vision with other texts, .Hoter was able to interpret the vision as a complete cosmology. Cosmology, however, was not enough for a medieval thinker. One had, also, to account for the downward flow of divine energy (or light) as well as for the upward flow of the human soul (or spirit). Hoter thus interpreted the Hebrew word for [the radiance of the] "electrum" to represent the emanation of the Intelligences one from another. And he interpreted the general radiance and fire that surrounded the vision as representing the process by which the forms (neoplatonic Ideas) were "impressed" into matter. As to the upward flow of the human soul, Hoter taught that man must learn about the structure of the cosmos from revelations such as Ezekiel's vision and, then, he must meditate his way up the vision: from the earth to the elements, to the spheres and their characteristics, to the Prime-Matters, to the Universal Soul, and finally to the Agent Intelligence. This last was the limit of human inquiry and meditation. To meditate upon it was to achieve the highest form of knowledge available to man. It was also to have "contact" with the divine mind. In this way Ezekiel's vision was transformed into the mystic's vision; theophany became mystical worship. David R. Blumenthal occupies the Jay and Leslie Cohen Chair of Judaic Studies at Emory University. He is the author of numerous books and articles, and currently is the vice-president of the Association for Jewish Studies.</page><page sequence="2">418 David R. Blumenthal he first chapter of Ezekiel is one of those classical texts which have evoked much explicative and harmonistic exegesis for it claims to be one of those very rare moments when man was permitted a glimpse of the form and actions of the heavenly beings. Briefly / 1 / the vision contained in chapter one is Ezekiel's description of the Glory of God as it approached him from the North. As it drew closer, the prophet saw it more clearly. The center of the vision was the Throne of sapphire which rested upon a firmament which was the color of dazzling ice. Below the firmament were the Hayyot, each of which had four faces, four wings, and an erect body which was the color of burnished copper. On the Throne sat the "likeness of the figure of a man" which was the color of fire from its hips downward and the color of electrum (one part gold and five parts silver) from its hips upward. Surrounding the entire Glory was a radiance which was the color of the rainbow. For Ezekiel, this vision was a theophany. For the rabbis of the mishnaic period, this vision was but an intimation of the much greater complexity and grandeur of the celestial palaces. For the medievals, such anthropomorphism was an anathema. Thus, the stage was set for exegesis of the harmonistic-integrative type. It was not, however, a simple matter to assign metaphorical meaning to the figures of the Ezekelian vision for they had to be understood in several contexts. First, there was the context of Isaiah's theophany in Chapter 6 (Question 59). Then, there was the context of other passages which used the same vocabulary, e.g., Ex. 24:6 (Question 27), Gen. 28:2 (Question 33), Zech. 4:2 (Question 66), Ps. 68:5 (Question 78), and similar passages. Then, there was the context of the rabbinic understanding of Ezekiel, e.g., the Targum to Ezekiel (Question 61), the PRE (Questions 68, 92), and the midrash (Questions 34, 35, 37, 63, 67, 70, 73). And, to be sure, there was the context of the Maimonidean interpretation of Ezekiel (Questions 36, 62, 73, 74, 76, 90, 95) / 2/. It also made a difference whether one interpreted Ezekiel as a metaphor for prophecy, or for cosmology, or for both (in different places). The decipherment of Hoter ben Shelomo's interpretation of Ezekiel's vision begins with the firmament which was the color of awesome ice. Basing himself on PRE which, in turn, based itself on the common usage of the word "firmament" (Heb., raqiqa) in Genesis 1:6-8 and Ezekiel 1:22-26, Hoter commented / 3/: [As to] his [i.e., the author of PRE] saying, "Which firmament is it that was created on the second [day]? I would say that it was the firmament which is above the head of the Hayyot," this indicates the all- encompassing sphere with all its forces and all its forms. In his other cosmological comments, Hoter consistently maintained this interpretation. Thus, he taught /4/: that God first created "water" which was the prime-matter common to all physical reality; that God then separated it into the "upper waters" and the "lower waters,"i.e., into the first prime-matter which was the substrate for the supernal physical beings and the second (or lower) prime-matter which was the substrate of the elements and the sublunar</page><page sequence="3">Ezekiel's Vision 419 physical beings; and that from the upper waters (i.e., from the first prime- matter) God caused the firmament (i.e., the outermost sphere) to come into being. This last step was accomplished by causing a drop of the upper waters to "gel" (Heb., hugleddh), a term taken from Bereshit Rabba. Hoter then associated this gelling process with Ezekiel's vision by noting that the Targum understood the phrase "as the color of awesome ice" to mean "as the color of [the] awesome gelled-substance" (Aram., ke-'eyn gelid hasin) /5/. In this identification of the firmament of Genesis and Ezekiel with the outermost sphere, Hoter appears to be following Maimonides and it is the exegetical harmonization of the various texts, together with the double prime-matter theory, that makes Hoter's interpretation unique /6/. Having established that the firmament of awesome ice stood for the outermost sphere, Hoter proceeded quite logically to teach that everything above the firmament stood for something above the outermost sphere in the cosmological hierarchy while everything below the firmament stood for something below the outermost sphere in the cosmological hierarchy. For example, he taught /7/: THE QUESTION What is the meaning of the splitting of the form of a man which is on the Throne, its upper part being the color of electrum and its lower part being the color of fire? THE ANSWER We say that these forms called "electrum" are an end and a beginning. [They are] the end of the forms which exist in their own essences [i.e., the Intelligences]. But there exist, there, other forms whose existence is not in their essences and which are established only by their being radiated into matter; these are the soul-forms. Since this form which has been called "electrum" is the end of the Intelligences and the beginning of the souls, he split this form and said, "And I saw. . ." His saying, may He be exalted, "from the appearance of its hips and upward," means: those spiritual forms of the level called "electrum," [and they] stand over against those projected souls ... and again /8/: "And, on the form of the Throne, ..." that is, for that split form, of which it is said, "from the appearance of its hips . .." It is known that the substrate of the all-encompassing sphere is the Universal Soul and [that] the protector of the Universal Soul is the Agent Intelligence. This level is the ultimate of the levels of the human intellect. For Hoter, then, the "split" figure on the Throne stood for the Agent Intelligence and the Universal Soul taken together because both are spiritual forms. That is, the figure represented the last of the emanatory chain of Intelligences and the first of the chain of souls. It was a transition figure in the descending cosmological hierarchy /9/. And, it was the limit of the ascending</page><page sequence="4">420 David R. Blumenthal hierarchy, i.e., of the process of intellection-prophecy / 10/. In all this, Hoter undoubtedly believed himself to be following Maimonides who also had seen the crucial nature of this figure, pointing out that it was the third, and the most noble, of the intellectual perceptions contained in Ezekiel's vision and, calling it "the split man" (Ar., al-rajul al-mubaccad) /11/. Maimonides had not, however, specified what being(s) in the hierarchy he had in mind except to state that this figure did not represent God / 12/. He also had not explained why the figure was "split." Having established that the split figure stood for the Universal Soul and the Agent Intelligence taken together and, that the firmament of awesome ice stood for the outermost sphere, IHoter faced the problem of the symbolism of the sapphire Throne. This Hoter understood as standing for the first prime- matter, because it was placed between the Universal Soul and the outermost sphere / 13/. Thus he taught / 14/: As to his [the author of PRE] saying, "Whence was earth created? From the snow under the Throne of Glory," this indicates the second prime-matter which is the prime-matter of the elements... Therefore, the prime-matters are two: the prime-matter of the simple [bodies] and the prime-matter of the compounded [bodies], the prime- matter of the simple [bodies] being more noble. And his saying, may his memory be a blessing, "from the snow under the Throne of Glory," this is because it [i.e., the snow] is far from the Throne. Again, in the context of the sin of the Elders of the Israelites [Ex. 24], .Hoter taught / 15/: that they perceived the first prime-matter which was "radiant, luminescent, translucent, simple, pure, and its [ultimate] origin was He"; that the first prime-matter emanated from the "light of His garment," and that it was the color of sapphire, i.e., the same color as the Throne of Glory. And in the context of his discussion of the split figure, while Hoter did not directly interpret the symbolism of the Throne he, having interpreted the figure as the end of spiritual reality, left open the clear assumption that the next entity was the beginning of physical reality, i.e., the first prime-matter / 16/. However, in the context of direct discussion of the term, "Throne" (Heb., kissjP), .Hoter avoided the cosmological symbolism and understood the term as a metaphor for the majesty of God's essence. In this he followed Maimonides' discussion of the same term / 17/. And in the context of the discussion of perception- prophecy, IHoter probably taught that the Throne stood for the Universal Soul while the figure stood for the Agent Intelligence. This was not an unknown interpretation in IHoter's milieu although it contradicted his other interpretation of the figure / 18/. Finally, in the context of the discussion of the firmament, .Hoter again did not directly interpret the Throne, although at one point he did note that the term "firmament" included its respective forces, the soul of the sphere among them / 19/. It is clear then that Hoter usually interpreted the sapphire Throne of Glory as standing for the first prime- matter but that at certain points his interpretation was ambiguous /20/. Two final aspects of Hoter's interpretation of that part of Ezekiel's vision which was above the firmament must be clarified: the "electrum" and the</page><page sequence="5">Ezekiel's Vision 421 "fire/ radiance." Concerning the "fire" of the figure and the "radiance" which surrounded the Glory, lHoter commented that cosmologically they represented the impression ("fire") made upon the souls by the illumination ("radiance") of the Intelligences, while in terms of perception-prophecy they represented the difficulty of perceiving the Agent Intelligence /21/. Concerning the "electrum" which comprised the upper half of the figure, .Hoter commented /22/: As to "electrum" (Heb., hashmal), it has two derived meanings because of the composition of the word: hash, mal. This points to two things: speed and being cut off. ... The Separated One emanates the forms unto all eternity and this is the meaning of the word "speed," and it is hash. The Sages, may their memory be a blessing, have said of the Agent Intelligence ... [that it is] that with which the cutting-off of the existence of the separated Intelligences [begins] .... This is the meaning of "cutting-off," and it is mal. "Electrum" thus stood for the emanation of the Intelligences and the ceasing thereof with the Agent Intelligence. As the images above the firmament of Ezekiel's vision were understood by IHoter to represent cosmological entities above the outermost sphere, so the images below the firmament were understood to represent cosmological entities below the outermost sphere. The decipherment of Hoter's interpretation of this symbolism begins with the differentiation he made between the Hayyot and the HIayyot ha-Qodesh. The former term referred to the creatures below the firmament in the vision of Ezekiel. Being below the outermost sphere, they represented other physical heavenly entities. The latter term, derived from the rabbinic liturgy (with roots in the Merkabah mystical literature), referred to the First Intelligence and hence represented beings "above" the firmament. In this Hoter followed Maimonides /23/. From the text of Ezekiel it would appear that there were four Hayyot, each of which had four faces and four wings. However, already the Targum construed the text to say that each creature had four faces and each face had four facets. This yielded sixteen facets per creature, with sixty-four facets altogether. In addition the Targum understood the phrase "four wings" to be applicable to each facet. This generated four wings for each facet, sixteen wings for each face, sixty-four wings for each creature, and a total of 256 wings for the whole / 24/. All this anthropomorphism was out of the question but the numbers and the fact that they were multiples of four gave Hoter and other medievals a ready tool of symbolic interpretation, for the quaternity was a mainstay of ancient and medieval numerology /25/. Thus Hoter's basic quaternities were: the four causes of the movement of each sphere /26/, the four orbs /27/, the four spheres within each orb /28/, the four elements, the four natural forces / 29/, the four qualities / 30/, the four types of sublunar beings / 31/, the four types of perception / 32/, and the four objects of perception /33/. These quaternities were rendered symbolically by /34/: the four cubits of the Halakha in which God has contained Himself, the four-</page><page sequence="6">422 David R. Blumenthal headed shin of the Tefillin, the four Hayyot/faces/facets and 'Ofannim, and the four steps of Jacob's ladder. These quaternities were also grouped into pairs using the symbolism of the two straps of the Tefillin and the pairs of ascending and descending angels /35/. And they were multiplied to form the number 256. Hoter's interpretation of the Hayyot was as follows: (four Hayyot) x (four faces) x (four facets) x (four wings) = 256 entities to be interpreted. They are: (four orbs) x (four spheres) x (four natural forces) x (four causes of the movement of each sphere) = 256 causes emanating from the spheres which exercise an influence on everything below them in the cosmological hierarchy / 36/. In interpreting the wings as causes, Hoter was following Maimonides /37/. In an unrelated exegetical comment, Hoter interpreted the four faces as a description of four aspects of the outermost sphere /38/. In addition to their faces and their wings, the Hayyot each had a body which stood erect and which was the color of burnished copper. Each also had a foot which was rounded like a calf's foot. Hoter interpreted the erect quality of the body as indicating two things: that the spheres had an undeviating, circular movement and that the perception which the spheres had of their respective Intelligences was also undeviating, i.e., unending /39/. He interpreted the color of burnished copper as indicating the purity of the matter. of the spheres /40/; the foot as representing that which was caused by the upper spheres (presumably, the lower spheres) / 41 /; and the roundness of the foot as indicating the roundness of the spheres /42/. Ezekiel's vision also contained four "wheels within wheels" whose rims were full of eyes. They were clearly described by Ezekiel as dependent upon The Hayyot for their movement. The place for them in Hoter's cosmology was below the spheres and above the sublunar world. (This was, after all, a vision of the heavenly realm.) Quite logically he interpreted the wheels as the spheres of the elements (perhaps as the elements themselves), the eyes representing the changing character of the beings to be generated out of the compounding of the elements /43/. Conclusion What then became of the vision of Ezekiel as Hoter ben Shelomo understood it? Hoter began by rejecting the anthropomorphisms of the vision. This forced him into a symbolic interpretation in which he construed the text as a revelation of the structure of the cosmos as follows: the figure on the Throne, which is electrum from its waist upwards and fire from its waist downwards, represented the Agent Intelligence and the Universal Soul respectively, yet taken together. The sapphire Throne represented the first Prime-Matter (the substrate of the supernal spheres); the firmament of awesome ice represented the outermost sphere; the Hayyot represented the other supernal spheres, the wings, faces, and facets representing the sum of natural causes that emanate from the spheres while the other parts of the body represented other aspects of the spheres such as their roundness, purity, and</page><page sequence="7">Ezekiel's Vision 423 perfect motion; finally, the Wheels represented the (spheres of the) elements. By integrating Ezekiel's vision with other texts, Hoter was able to interpret the vision as a complete cosmology. Cosmology, however, was not enough for a medieval thinker. One had also to account for the downward flow of divine energy (or light) as well as for the upward flow of the human soul (or spirit). Ho.ter interpreted the Hebrew word for "[radiance of the] electrum" to represent the emanation of the Intelligences one from another. And he interpreted the general radiance and fire that surrounded the vision as representing the process by which the forms (neoplatonic Ideas) were "impressed" into matter. As to the upward flow of the human soul, Hoter taught that man must learn about the structure of the cosmos from revelations such as Ezekiel's vision, and then he must meditate his way up the vision: from the earth to the elements, to the spheres and their characteristics, to the Prime-Matters, to the Universal Soul, and finally to the Agent Intelligence. This last was the limit of human inquiry and meditation. To meditate upon it was to achieve the highest form of knowledge available to man. It was also to have "contact" with the divine mind. In this way Ezekiel's vision was transformed into the mystic's vision; theophany became mystical worship /44/. NOTES / 1/ For the vision of Ezekiel, see chapter 1. For the later rabbinic development of this vision into the Merkabah literature, cf. D. Blumenthal, Understanding Jewish Mysticism, and G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, ch. 2. The fifteenth-century Yemenite savant through whose eyes we shall examine Ezekiel's vision was Ho.ter ben Shelomo. Only two of his works have been published: cf. D. Blumenthal, The Commentary of R.

I have dealt with the difference between "explicative-clarificatory" and "harmonistic-integrative" exegesis in PQ &amp; A, in the appropriate chapter. /2/ Hoter dealt with the Ezekielian vision, directly or indirectly, in the following Questions: 34-36, 62, 68, 73-77, 88, 90, 92, and 95. Maimonides dealt with Ezekiel's vision in the Guide as follows: III:1-3 (description of the vision in Ezekiel 1, 8-11); 111:4 (comment to the Targum); III 5-7 (comment on the figure on the Throne and on Isaiah ch. 6). He dealt with individual aspects of the vision in other chapters as follows: nehoshet (II: 10, 29, 43; 111:2); regel/cegel/hashmal(I:28,43; II: 10, 29,43; III:2); kanaf (1:43, 49); kisse (1:9), the heavens (1:9, 28, 70); and the angels (esp. MT, "Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah," 2:5-7). In spite of all this, Maimonides' precise interpretation remained obscure because of his reticence in interpreting esoteric texts and ideas.</page><page sequence="8">424 David R. Blumenthal /3/ Question 68 citing PRE, ch. 4 (ed. Luria, 9b). /4/ Question 70, with the notes there. Cf. also Question 69 and Comm., 17-23, for the cosmology. /5/ Ibid., end. /6/ Cf. Guide, 11:30 (Joel, 247:14f.) where the same rabbinic passages are cited. Maimonides does not stipulate a (first) prime-matter for supernal physical reality, probably because all the beings in it are formed out of the quintessence. Hoter, on the other hand, reasoning that in-formation (or impressing a form into a substance) did not suffice for sublunar beings and hence could not suffice for supernal beings, did read Maimonides as teaching the existence of a first prime-matter (cf. Comm., 20, n.3, for his reading of this passage from Guide, 11:30). Cf. also Question 72, n. 11, for other Maimonidean passages. /7/ Question 36. Note the interweaving of Ezekielian and Ismaili terminology. /8/ Question 35, toward the end. /9/ This is further confirmed by Hoter's interpretation of the "fire" and "radiance" as standing for the processes of emanation and in-formation (impressing of forms into matter). / 10/ Question 35, as just cited, and Question 5 where Moses' prophecy is clearly described in these terms. / 11/ Guide, 111:5 (Joel, 306:9) and 111:7 (Joel, 309:8). / 12/ Ibid., III:7 (Joel, 309:12). For the Ismaili tendency to merge the Universal Soul and the Agent Intelligence, see PQ &amp; A, at the appropriate chapter. /13/ Hoter was very clear on the subject of his cosmology: after the Tenth Intelligence came the Universal Soul. After it came the first prime-matter and after it came the spheres and the second prime-matter. (He was not clear on the subject of the direct provenience of the second prime-matter, i.e., whether it came from the last sphere or whether it came directly from the first prime-matter, "skipping" the step of the spheres. In Comm., 23, I decided in favor of the former and am still so inclined.) This cosmological sequence was treated by Ho.ter in the context of Genesis (Questions 68 and 70) and in the context of PRE (Question 92). / 14/ Question 92, citing PRE, ch. 3. As I commented, ad loc, the sequence appears to be: the "light of His garment" (the Agent Intelligence with the Universal Soul) yielded the "heavens" (the first prime-matter and then the spheres), while the "Throne of Glory" (the first prime-matter) yielded the "snow" (the second prime-matter) which yielded "earth" (the elements and sublunar reality). The "Throne" was included in the "heavens," indicating the most noble part thereof (cf. also Question 90). Maimonides, too, taught that "Throne" could be used of the "heavens," (Guide, 1:9) although as noted above he did not envision a first prime-matter. / 15/ Question 27 with parallels cited, ad loc, and in Comm., 20, 22, and 102. Cf. Question 77, n.13, that Hoter differed with Maimonides on this. /16/ Questions 35 and 36. / 17/ Cf. Question 90. /18/ Question 34: " .. the Universal Soul is emanated from the light of the</page><page sequence="9">Ezekiel's Vision 425 Intelligence and they compared the emanator with the emanated saying, 'And on the form of the Throne was a form of the appearance of a man ...'" For the Throne as the Universal Soul, cf. Nur al-Zalam, (ed. Y. Qafih), 6, cited in Question 90. / 19/ Questions 68 and 70. In the former Ho.ter uncharacteristically called the soul of the sphere, "the Universal Soul" (cf. the notes, ad loc). In any case it was contained within the term "firmament," the term "Throne" not being interpreted by him. / 20/ Perhaps this was due to the highly esoteric nature of the doctrine of the first prime-matter (cf. Comm., loc cit., and Question 70, beginning). /21/ Question 36, end. /22/ Question 75, following Guide, 111:7 (Joel, 309:1). For the sources of this popular etymology (and another like it), cf. the notes, ad loc. /23/ Question 95. In Guide, 111:1-7, Maimonides mentioned the IHayyot but did not make his symbolism explicit. All the commentators, however, understood him to be talking of supernal physical reality. This is to be contrasted with MT, "Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah," 2:5-7, where the Hayyot ha-Qodesh are listed among the angels (i.e., the Intelligences). Hoter's attempt to harmonize these sources is admirable though weak. /24/ Cf. Question 61, where the text and explanation is given in full. /25/ Hoter dealt with the theme of quaternity in Questions 33, 38, 61, 68, 77, and 78. [Cf. also the scribal note to Question 67.] Maimonides dealt with quaternity in Guide, II:10 and 111:2, where most of Hoter's quaternities appear although Maimonides did not organize them systematically. To be sure, reality understood as a group of quaternities conflicted with the conception of reality conceived as a set of tens (as in al-Farabi), or of fives (as in the neo-platonists), or of sevens (as in Talmud, "Hagiga," 12b, quoted in Guide, 1:70). Medievals, however, did not permit such matters to interfere with their theology. /26/ Its soul, its own internal intellect, its shape, and the object of its perception (i.e., its Intelligence). Cf. Questions 60 and 61. /27/ An orb (Ar., kura) is larger than a sphere (Ar.,falak), the former containing several of the latter. The four orbs are: that of the permanent stars, that of the moving stars, that of the sun, and that of the moon. Cf. Questions 33, 60, and 61. /28/ The sphere which bears the stars, the sphere of the constellation, the sphere which inclines, and the sphere which rotates. These terms are somewhat puzzling but not unknown. Cf. Question 61 and the scribal note to Question 67. /29/ The force which brings inanimate objects into being, the force of the plant- soul, the force of the animal-soul, and the force of the rational-soul. Inanimate objects have no "souls" but they must have a "force" which functions as a soul, i.e., which brings them into being and sustains their existence. Cf. Questions 33, 60, 61, and 62. /30/ Wetness, dryness, cold, and warmth. /31/ Minerals, plants, animals, and man. /32/ Perception of the sensibles, the spheres, the souls, and the Intelligences. Cf.
