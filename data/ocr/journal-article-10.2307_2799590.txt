Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt and neolithic Crete with comparative material from the prehistoric Near East and mainland Greece (R. anthrop. Inst. Occ. Pap. 24). xvi, 530 pp., plates, figs., tables, bibliogr. London: Andrew Szmidla, 1968. ~6 6s. The neolithic figurines of Crete and Egypt have long been the subject of speculation and comment: it is remarkable, therefore, that this work should be the first systematic study of them. Systematic it certainly is, since the first part is a corpus, listing 226 Egyptian predynastic figurines and the 103 Cretan neolithic examples known. All the Cretan figurines and a proportion of the Egyptian ones are illustrated by the author's adequate drawings, and a good number by photo- graphs also (although the layout of the plates is flagrantly wasteful of space). Each figurine is described in detail, the occurrence of specific traits such as material of manufacture, arm position, indication of sex, as well as context, being given quantitatively for each group. This careful and well documented survey constitutes a major contribution to our know- ledge of the subject. Among minor points, however, which might perhaps be modified:</page><page sequence="2">298 BOOK REVIEWS good quality marble is now documented from Crete itself; Cretan figurine no. 68 is, I believe, certainly part of a Folded Arm Figurine of Early Cycladic type and date; the authenticity of the Kato lerapetra figurine is neither explicitly accepted nor rejected by the author. The comprehensive corpus for these areas is followed by a study of finds from neo- lithic Hacilar, Jarmo and other predynastic Near Eastem sites and from mainland Greece. Although not setting out to be complete this study provides good material, some of it in quantitative form, for comparison and discussion. This admirably detailed study occupies three quarters of the length of the book, and invests the succeeding discussion of inter- cultural relations with considerable authority. Ucko concludes that the evidence provided by similar features is not sufficient to indicate intercultural connexions between Egypt, neolithic Crete and Hacilar. Possible influence from Mesopotamia to Egypt, neolithic Crete and neolithic Greece is indicated. But here Ucko's numerical analysis is far from ideal, for although the frequency of each trait in each area is very properly considered, there is no good analysis of trait correlations. In such a study the consideration of frequencies of single features-especially when they are as generalised as the indication of backbone-seems inadequate, and good use might have been made here of some of the concepts of numerical taxonomy, such as taxonomic distance. One good parallel on the basis of several correlated features would carry more conviction than the computation of frequencies of these single traits. However, Ucko's findings here are properly cautious. The essential point is that for the first time they are based on a consideration of all the relevant material. This is what gives particular importance to his discussion of the inter- pretation of the figurines, which will be of general interest to many not specifically concerned with east Mediterranean prehistory. Despite the caution and moderation with which he expresses his conclusions, they are a devastating indictment of the uncritical way the concept of an almost universal reverence for an 'Earth Mother Goddess' has been accepted by prehistorians. No evidence was found to suggest that the figurines in question represented a fertility goddess. Ucko il- luminatingly employs modem ethno- graphical parallels to suggest possible functions, and if such further figurines as may be found in future are published with full details of context, the prospect for pro- gress is not a bleak one. But first, archaeolo- gists and students of prehistoric religion will have to overhaul present theories very critically. Because he has chosen a limited field, and within it listed the totality of the available evidence, considering it systemati- cally, Ucko's work is a major contribution. It should have a considerable impact in a field where at present almost every statement that is made rests on inadequate foundations. COLIN RENFREW</page></plain_text>
