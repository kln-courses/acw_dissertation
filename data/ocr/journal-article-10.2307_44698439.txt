(Minucius Felix, Oct. 22) But if anyone calls to mind with what assault-weaponry and with what lifting-machinery every statue is formed, he will blush at his fearing matter, sported with by a craftsman to make a god. For a god of wood, perhaps part of a pyre or a gallows is hung up, hewn, carved, planed; and a bronze or silver god is melted down from a foul vessel, as often was done for the Egyptian king, and is beaten with mallets and shaped on anvils; and a stone god is hewn, carved and polished by a polluted man, nor does it perceive the insult of its birth, nor likewise afterwards the observance of your worship. Unless it is the case that the stone or wood or silver is not yet a god. When therefore is this god born?

Indeed it is a mere diverting pastime (inlusam) for craftsmen which produces such gods as quickly as you can say ut deum jhceret. The answer to the question of when such a god is born is provocatively dragged out only to be pithily summed up: tunc postremo deus est, cum homo ilium uoluit (then at last it is a god, when man wished it to be). As homo chiastically balances deus, so homo is foregrounded as the ultimate cause of any deus: a pagan god is born when and only when a human decides to make one. In similar vein Athenagoras breezes through a history of pagan statue manufacture to arrive at this thundering conclusion: ó 118V 8fļ xpóvoç òAíyoç xooouxoç xaîç eucóai Kai xfj rcepi xà sïôcotax 7cpayjiax8Íq, coç ëxeiv eirceïv xòv émaxou xexvíxrjv 0eoñ [...] croveXóvxa cpávai, ouSèv auxœv Siarceipeuyev xò ļifļ i m9 àvGpamoD yeyovévai. ei xoívDV 08OÍ, xi ovK fjaav éč, àpxfiç; xi Sé eiaiv vecoxepoi xœv 7C87cou1kóxcùv; xi Sé 8Õei aòxoiç rcpòç xò yevéaGai àv0p&lt;xmcov Kai xéxvqç; yfj xauxa Kaì A,i0oi Kaì x)h' Kaì rcepíepyoç xé%vr|.

Why are they more recent than those who have made them? Why did 1 All translations are my own. 2 Minucius Felix and other early Christian apologists coined the term planus as an insult, and for that reason modern scholars have often felt uneasy about adopting it: no 'pagan' would ever have called him or herself a pagan. Yet pagan is an eminendy useful word in that it refers succincdy to an accepted category of people (namely anyone in the ancient world who would not classify themselves as Christian or Jewish) without retaining any of its original insulting connotations. Therefore I will use the term throughout: my discussion will in practice be limited to those pagans who viewed themselves as polytheists. 30</page><page sequence="3">AILSA HUNT they need men and craftsmanship in order to come into existence? These statues are earth and stones and wood and elaborate craftsmanship. Having branded statues as incapable of escaping public recognition of their true nature, Athenagoras pours out relentless rhetorical questions which drive the reader to an elliptical assertion of what statues really are: yrj xauxa Kai XiQoi Kal x&gt;fo' Kai 7U£píspyoç xéyyt] (these statues are earth and stones and wood and elaborate craftsmanship). So patently are these statues nothing more than material plus a bit of craftsmanship that they are quite sufficiently described simply by being placed in apposition with these materials and the sculptor's xé^vT}.3 Both Minucius Felix and Athenagoras write as though faced with a basic misconception held by obtuse pagans, completely oblivious of anything potentially problematic in their equation of material statues with gods and in their manufacture of these statues. This rhetorical construction implied a level of confidence and coherence to pagan religious thought about statues of the gods which was in fact lacking. Christian critique distorts pagan thought about these statues by framing it in very stark terms, namely by equating statues with pagan gods, whilst for many pagans statues occupied a conceptual grey area somewhere in between being gods and representing gods. Correspondingly, human manufacture of such statues presented a theologically ambiguous process, about which pagan thought was at once more nuanced and more hesitant than the Christian apologists caricaturing it were willing to allow. Many pagans, I propose, were awake to theologically difficult implications arising from human manufacture of statues of the gods. Indeed pagan conceptions of the ontological status of statues of the gods demand a closer look than the apologists granted them. A pagan might have located a statue of a god at any point on a weakly demarcated sliding scale between being the god and representing the god. Literary and artistic depictions of statues rarely pinpointed them on this scale, but rather situated them in an area of it, which may have shifted depending on who was looking at the statue, when, why and in what context: this forms a serious stumbling block to modern attempts to pin down their precise status. Ando, for example, concludes concerning the black stone from Pessinus that 'people in the ancient world might well have understood that Cybele somehow was, and yet was not coexistensive with, their black stone'.4 Unsatisfying as this conclusion may seem on the surface, its great merit is that it accurately reflects the fluidity of Roman 3 Placing XÉXVT1 in a list alongside the statues' materials also strangely objectifies it, thus further undermining the process by which gods are brought to birth. 4 Ando (2008) 42. 31</page><page sequence="4">PRJAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION thinking about the status of an individual statue. Modern critics tend to be more intellectually comfortable towards the end of the scale where statues are understood as representational, and Gordon therefore has been deservedly influential in emphasising how often pagan thinkers found themselves at the other end of the scale, due to what he calls the 'ancient 'failure' to distinguish between god and statue'.5 Gordon notes how ancient authors would often write 'Artemis' when referring to what we feel compelled to describe as 'a statue of Artemis', or at the very least, 'an Artemis'.6 He perceptively emphasises that it is not ancient authors but modern translators who are 'conscious of a semantic difficulty in applying the name of the divinity to the statue'.7 Eisner valuably turns to the complex range of options embraced by the middle area of the scale, analysing hints in Pausanias of 'a much more dynamic interpénétration of image and referent, representation and prototype than we usually allow for in discussions of mimesis'.8 This slippage between a statue and what it 'represents', to use terminology from one end of the scale, is by no means confined to statues of divinities. It constitutes a playful topos of epigram, and unsurprisingly so considering epigram's penchant for statue dedications and speaking statues: the range of this topos I will illustrate with two examples, one a statue of a dog and one a statue of a god.9 Tòv KÚva, xàv 7üf|pav xs Kai àyicuXóôovxa aiyuvov Ilaví xs Kai Núpxpaiç ávxíGspai Àpuáaiv* xòv KÚva 8s Çcòovxa rcáÀiv rcoxi xauAiov aÇco Çripàç siç (xkóXodç Çuvòv s/siv ëxapov (AP 6.176).

On this interpénétration see also Steiner (2001) 79-104 and Stewart (2002) 35-45. See Steiner (2001) 105-20, Elsner (2007) 11 and Woolf (2001) 125 on the types of cult action which might arise from the conceptual blurring between statue and god. 9 The first example (AP 6.176) is by a sixth-century AD poet, Macedonius Consul, and the second (API. 175) by the first-century BC poet Antipater: the gap in date of composition illustrates epigram's persistent engagement with the topos. See Piatt (2002) 33-50 for an analysis of the 'complex relationship between divine prototype and mortal representation', focused through epigrammatic depictions of Knidian Aphrodite (34). 32</page><page sequence="5">AILSA HUNT On reading line three we first understand xòv KÓva (this dog) to be the statue dog of line one, as encouraged by its repeated position at the front of the line. Yet the author Macedonius Consul anchors the humour of this epigram on ôé, which so narrowly separates the living dog from the statue dog that we are made to read 'I will lead the statue dog alive back to my cottage', before we understand 'I will lead the living dog back to my cottage'. Similarly Antipater holds up to the light the ill-defined nature of the gap between a stone statue of Aphrodite and the goddess herself. "H M0oç còç ITacpíri 0(ûpf)ÇaTO, tļ xá%a pãÀAov eîSe M0OV Ila(pír| Kai tôpoaev* ""H0eXov sīvai." (API. 175). Either the stone armed itself as Paphian Aphrodite, or perhaps rather Aphrodite saw the stone and swore 'If only I were it'. By ascribing a conscious will either to the stone to be dressed as the other entity, or to the goddess to become the other entity, Antipater locates the statue within two areas on the scale between being and representation. Both these ways of understanding the relationship between statue and goddess are expressed as options, and their hypothetical nature is intensified both by use of metaphor (dressing up as the goddess) and by making the goddess reflect on her own status through an unfulfilled wish; ultimately Antipater plumps for no particular mode of comprehension. I Let us direct critical interest in the ambiguous theological status of these statues onto a specific category of statues, namely wooden statues of the god Priapus.10 Through this focused sample I intend to paint an alternative picture to the Christian image of pagan failure to engage intellectually with the manufacture of statues of the gods. I will also fill in the flip side of the picture: did the destruction of a statue of a god conceptually entail the god's death? I will be concerned with the Priapus most frequently met in Roman sources, namely a garrulous, ithyphallic god who delights in vaunting his sexual prowess. He also commonly guards a garden, threatening with 10 O'Connor (1989) 25 lists the materials of Priapus statues featuring in literary depictions, of which wood is by far the most common. 33</page><page sequence="6">PRIAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION rape those who steal its produce or otherwise arouse his attention.11 Snapshots of wooden Priapus statues will be drawn from the Carmina Priapea, Martial, Columella, Horace, the Appendix Virgiliana, the Anthologia Planudea and Romano-Campanian wall painting: the selection is thus strongly weighted towards epigram, as well as its attendant concern with statue representation. I do not wish to add to the debate concerning the authorship and date of the Carmina Priapea, but suffice it to say that this collection is invariably dated between the Augustan period and the late first century AD, or just into the second century AD so as to postdate Martial.12 The priapea of the Appendix Virgiliana are also located at a variety of points within this time-frame.13 The two epigrams from the Anthologia Planudea whose wooden Priapus statues I discuss (API. 86 and API. 260) are anonymous and therefore undatable. Incorporating all known possibilities, then, the data of my study constitute literary and artistic representations of wooden Priapus statues from the first century BC to the early second century AD. I should also clarify that although the willingness of wooden Priapus statues to talk about themselves further qualifies them as an excellent source for engaging with conceptions of statues' theological status, I do not approach this collection of data as a unified 'Priapic voice'. However, I do hold that these literary and artistic representations of the god engage with and voice a nexus of similar concerns: correspondingly it is illuminating to study them together, as individual voices contributing to a shared cultural debate from a variety of angles. Advising on the ideal guardian statue for a garden, Columella dismisses polished works of craftsmanship in favour of a carved tree trunk, instructing the reader to worship it as the godhead of Priapus (10.31-2). Columella equates the tree trunk with Priapus the god by setting truncum (trunk) and numen (godhead) in apposition, both nouns standing as object of the command to worship. As an aid to empathising with this conceptual blurring between wooden statue and god, from now on I will often refer to such wooden statues of Priapus simply as 'wooden Priapus'. At first ascribing to a god the qualities of his statue may seem disconcerting, but we must remember that is was not so for Tibullus, reminiscing about the days when people knew how to respect lignea ... Pales (wooden Pales, 2.5.28) or indeed any ligneus ... deus (wooden god, 11 Priapus also had roles as a god of harbours and fishermen (eg. AP 10.1) and as patron god of Lampsacus (eg. API. 242). 12 See Parker (1988) 32-7 for a succinct summary of the 'insoluble' debate over authorship and dating (36). Richlin (1983) 141-3 surveys the evidence and likewise offers no conclusive opinion. 13 See Parker 12-13, Rand (1919) 129-132, Büchner (1955) 1068-70 and Richmond (1981) 1145 for discussion of the vexed question of the authorship and date of these priapea. 34</page><page sequence="7">AILSA HUNT 1.10.20).14 Nor indeed was it odd for Priapus himself, who styles himself in CP 6 as 1 igneus ... Priapus (wooden Priapus, 1) and in Priap. 1 as 'igneus ... hie deus (this wooden god, 3-4). Nevertheless, scholarly commitment to the conceptual slippage between statue and god in pagan eyes often falters when faced with wooden Priapus.15 Typical is Parker's identification of a group of poems within the Carmina Priapea in which 'we are not concerned with the deity of Priapus the god, but with the behaviour of the rudely-carved statues erected in the countryside by farmers and peasants to scare away birds and thieves'.16 Seemingly this is partly due to underlying presumptions that a statue so crude as to spend most of his time showing offhis enormous penis and raping anyone in sight could not possibly be a 'real' god.17 Emphasis on the unsophisticated wooden appearance of Priapus statues also deters scholars from understanding them as potentially conflated with the god Priapus; his rough-hewn appearance renders the conceptually problematic overlap of a material statue and a divine agent harder to ignore. Priapus experienced this kind of prejudice in his own day too, for wooden statues were often the butt of jokes.18 In API. 187 a pun equates being wooden with complete inefficacy as a god, as betrayed when a wooden Hermes is put to the test by a human 14 Ando (2008) 21-42 battles against some of the ingrained presumptions which make such pagan models disconcerting. 15 Herter (1932) 31 does notice the lack of clear distinction between statue and Priapus, but shies away from it and presents it as a rustic mistake: 'rustici ipsi simulacra sua manu facta a numine ipso non semper satis distinxerunť. Stewart (2002) 74 is one scholar who bucks the trend of modern indifference to the blurring between Priapus and his statues, observing that 'the god and his cult image are portrayed as one and the same thing'. A more nuanced statement is needed to embrace the range of options for understanding the relationship between Priapus and his statues, but a level of assimilation is certainly at the root of theologically hesitant expressions of his manufacture and destruction. 16 Parker (1988) 43. 17 Exemplifying this type of sentiment, Uden (2007) 15 writes that 'a constant tension between Priapus' divinity and the shameless licentiousness of his actions makes itself felt in ancient accounts of Priapus'. 18 Indeed wooden statues could prompt such hilarity that Athenaeus describes how such a statue succeeded in snapping someone out of a pathological inability to laugh (Drip. 14.614b). It is because of attitudes like this thatTibullus urges his wooden lares neu pudeat prisco vos esse e stipite factos (do not be ashamed that you were made from an old fashioned stump, 1.10.17). On the other hand, it is true that some wooden statues (Çóava) were coloured with venerable associations, their crude appearance symbolic of a religiously upright halcyon past. (For a detailed discussion of the term Çóava and its resonances see Donohue (1988)). For Tibullus wooden gods signal a lost morality (1. 10.19-20) and Pliny the Elder aligns the end of Roman production of wooden statues with the conquest of the East, unde luxuria (whence comes luxury, Nat. 34.34). However, my focus in this article is on wooden Priapus at the point of manufacture and destruction, when it is the problems caused by his woodenness rather than its venerable associations which are naturally highlighted, and I do not offer a more general assessment of the cultural connotations of wooden statues. 35</page><page sequence="8">PRJAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION plea for help: 'Eppsirļ ÇuAivco tiç s7rr|i)X£TO, Kai ÇúÀuv rjev (a certain man prayed to a wooden Hermes, and he was wooden, 1).19 Priapus is indeed acutely conscious that his crude wooden appearance may throw up doubts about his efficacy as a god, often introducing his woodenness in a concessive clause before vigorously asserting his sexual prowess as an illustration of his agency.20 In CP 6 Priapus begins with a self- effacingly comprehensive account of how wooden he is: quod sum ligneus, ut vides, Priapus et faix lignea ligneusque penis ... (1-2) although I am a wooden Priapus, as you see, and my sickle is wooden and my penis is wooden ... but concludes that nevertheless he will thrust this wooden penis right up to the seventh rib of the girl whom he is addressing (3-6). 21 On two occasions concern about Priapus' woodenness is even more overtly revealed when his retort of sexual prowess drops out from the above model, repeated so often that it feels like a type scene from which the absence of any element stands out like a sore thumb. In CP 56 Priapus melodramatically laments (heu heu; alas alas, 3) that his penis is wooden, and rather than countering this by asserting his sexual power concludes that he will ask his master to irrumate thieves on his behalf (5-6). Similarly in Priap. 2 a farm overseer usurps Priapus' role by breaking off his penis for use as a cudgel to drive away a thief. He also breaks off Priapus in mid penetration threat; the comic implication that this wooden 19 This epigram is also anonymous and therefore undatable. 20 As a fishermen's Priapus asserts at AP 10.8 (an epigram by Archias from the first century BC), he is the kind of god better known from his actions than from his appearance. See O'Connor (1989) 184-5 for a brief discussion of troubling aspects of Priapus' woodenness, both in 'erotic poems and minae, where he belies his wooden origins, as well as in inverse minae where the god, by being wood, is threatened' (184). 21 In similar vein Priapus tells an interlocutor that although he is wooden, his 'spear' aptetur ueris usibus (is fit for real usage, CP 43.4). Again when his penis is viewed with scepticism by certain girls, Priapus reassures them that this apparendy inutile lýnum (useless piece of wood) will certainly be utilis (useful) inside them (CP 73.3-4). Nor is this motif restricted to the Carmina Priapea. We meet a figwood Priapus in API. 86 who is frank about his roughly carved appearance, and accepts that such an appearance invites laughter. Yet, he warns, if you overstep the line and damage the property of his owner, you will find yourself laughing grimly: doubtless the implication is that the mocker will receive the rape which Priapus threatens ad nauseam in such circumstances. Cf. the crudely carved figwood statue of Theocr. Ep. 4 who claims to be able to perform the works of Aphrodite despite his appearance (2-4). 36</page><page sequence="9">AILSA HUNT Priapus was all talk and no trousers voices wider conceptual concerns about ascribing agency to a material statue.22 Priapus' home-made wooden appearance and exuberantly arrogant sexual boasts problematise the ease with which we understand wooden Priapus as both god and statue: they also render him acutely susceptible to mockery. Our predisposition to laugh at Priapus makes us accordingly sensitive to any aspects of personal weakness which he might display: the moment of his manufacture and his impending death must be prominent points of weakness in any sketch of his existence. A focus on manufacture and destruction in representations of Priapus, as about to be analysed in depth in parts II and III, is, however, not just an idiosyncracy resulting from his comical nature. The nature of his material is far more to blame. For the relative crudeness and vulnerability of wooden statues, in comparison with stone or metallic statues, draws attention to Priapus' manufacture and intensifies the likelihood of his destruction, both problematic processes for all statues which are also to some degree gods.23 Thus wooden Priapus constitutes a rich source through which to engage with wider conceptual hesitancy about the manufacture and destruction of statues of the gods, which are, whatever their constituent material, invariably of ambiguous ontological status.24 A garrulous god whose favourite topic is himself, wooden Priapus concentrates issues which are very much present, but are felt with less urgency and intensity, in representations of gods of other materials. II References to the manufacture of Priapus must inevitably have conjured up images of human dependence which would have sat uneasily with his status as a divine agent.25 22 Uden (2010) 197 succinctly sums up the theological rub of this poem: 'the contrast between Priapus and the strong-armed uilicus ... exposes Priapus' inadequacies: he is wooden and immobile'. 23 Minucius Felix draws no such distinction in problematic intensity when lumping into one category wooden, bronze, silver and stone gods (Oct. 22). Of course wooden statues are not entirely alone in their fragility: representations of terracotta statues of the gods might foreground similar issues. 24 Woolf (2001) 125 observes that the act of representing a god in a literary text could be understood as a religious act. Likewise I take literary and artistic representations of statues which are themselves representations of gods to constitute a process of theological engagement with thorny concepts. 25 In light of the conceptual blurring between statue and god, I only note the theological problems thrown up by the plurality of statues of the same god, analysis of which lies outside the scope of this article. These problems are rarely foregrounded in the texts discussed as they tend to focus on interaction with one Priapus statue at a time, with CP 33 and Martial 8.40 providing exceptions which prove the rule. 37</page><page sequence="10">PRIAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION Admittedly I believe that pagan polytheists were much more comfortable with the concept of divine births than monotheists like Minucius Felix tend to be, but nevertheless references to Priapus' recent birth would have undermined his status as an immortal: a divine birth projected back to the opening credits of the history of the cosmos is one thing, a divine birth which the human addressing Priapus can remember attending is quite another. Indeed concerns about manufacture expressed by Priapus himself sound loud against the background noise of his characteristic aggressive sexual confidence, and indeed admission of his manufactured status often goes hand in hand with rare self- deprecating moments. Thus in API. 260 Priapus admits in response to an imagined question that his behaviour of raping garden intruders is shameful for a god, but concludes somewhat bathetically that it was for this purpose that he was set up (3-4). Wooden Priapus lets slip mention of the final stage of his manufacture at the very point when his divinity is most coming under attack. Even when mocked by someone with no more intellectual weight than an insulsissima ... puella (very stupid girl, CP 10.1), Priapus immediately goes on the defensive about his manufacture, pointing out that he was no work of Praxiteles or Scopas or Phidias: sed lignum rude vilicus dolavit et dixit mihi: tu Priapus esto (CP 10. 4-5) but the farm overseer cut a rough piece of wood and said to me: you, be Priapus. Priapus' birth was the result of a human command, a command moreover which by its very terseness comes across as halfhearted and totally lacking in any sense of awe for the divine. Priapus' reference back to the lignum rude (rough piece of wood) by means of the personal pronoun simply reinforces the farm overseer's belittling tone. Again in Horace S. 1.8 Priapus emphasises the chance nature and dependence on human decision of his coming into existence:26 olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum, cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum, maluit esse deum. deus inde ego .... (1-3) 26 Buchheit (1962) 63 also notes the 'Widerspiel zwischen Hilflosigkeit und Gottheit' exemplified in this satire. 38</page><page sequence="11">AILSA HUNT Once I was a figwood trunk, a useless piece of wood, when a craftsman, unsure whether to make a stool or a Priapus, preferred it to be a god. Since then I have been a god ... The unexpectedly sudden decision, following directly on Priapus' account of the craftsman's dilemma, underscores the whimsical nature of his choice, as does its lack of explanation: he simply preferred the god. No sooner was this whim conceived than Priapus was a god, the juxtaposition of deum and deus highlighting the instantaneity of his creation and thus comically disparaging the significance of the moment. This negative emphasis on the speed of manufacture and the utter dependence of a god on a craftsman's volition shows that pagans were indeed concerned by precisely those aspects of god manufacture which Minucius Felix satirised (Oct. 22). At other times Priapus has critics to emphasise his manufacture for him. The speaker of Martial 8.40 warns Priapus to guard well the wood of which he has been placed in charge: non horti neque palmitis beati sed rari nemoris, Priape, custos, ex quo natus es et potes renasci ... (1-3) you are not the guard of a garden, Priapus, nor of a rich vineyard but of a sparse wood, from which you were born and can be born again ... The threat of Priapus' 'rebirth', or in other words replacement by a new Priapus sourced from the wood, cruelly undermines the mock seriousness of the terminology of 'birth': within half a line this is revealed to be no more than a form of manufacture. Finally, in one striking epigram Priapus highlights his own manufactured nature by an unsetding reference to the times before he existed. In CP 68 Priapus rewrites Homer, and Penelope ends up holding a competition to find out which of the suitors has the best penis: Priapus regrets that he did not have the chance to win as he was non dum tempore /actus (not yet at that time made, 38). Again Priapus uses workmanlike vocabulary of construction at a point when his image as a timeless divinity is extremely compromised. This comic irony, by which Priapus is made his own worst enemy when it comes to promulgating his divinity, is one angle of engagement with the conceptually problematic nature of manufacturing a statue-god. On other occasions I propose that wooden Priapus attempts to allay, rather than self- deprecatingly emphasise, the worrying implications of manufacture. This he does by 39</page><page sequence="12">PRIAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION presenting himself as a living tree rather than a wooden statue.27 This tree-like pose mitigates the process of manufacture, eliding the necessary transition from tree to statue in the production of a wooden statue.28 In Pr iap. 2 Priapus introduces himself as a tree: ego artefabricata rustica / ego arida . . . populus (I a dry poplar tree, shaped by rustic skill, 1-2). Priapus may have undergone a bit of artless carving, but his identity is fundamentally that of a tree. Likewise in Priap. 3 he describes himself as a quercus arida rustica fomitata securi (a dry oak chipped by rustic axe, 5-6). Once again Priapus is a carved tree, not a statue carved from a tree. It is perhaps telling that Priapus emphasises his vivacity as an organic tree on occasions when he also admits that he is dry and withered (both trees are described as arida): is this somewhat ineffective rhetoric imposed on Priapus the author's cutting hint at the tension inherent in understanding a dead piece of wood as a living god? Is Priapus' attempt at smoothing over the distinction between tree and statue set up only to be undermined? Finally, in Horace S. 1.8 Priapus recounts how he frightened off certain witches with a fart: pepedi / diffissa nate ficus (I farted, a figtree with split buttocks, 46-7). Since the scansion demands that 27 By posing as a tree Priapus slots himself into a world in which trees regularly blurred with statues and vice versa. Tree-like statues featured in evolutionary narratives about Roman sculptural and religious development, Pliny the Elder telling us that in the old days Romans had arborea ... simulacra numinum (arboreal images of the gods, Nat. 12.5): they were not just wooden but actually tree-like. Transferring this image of primitive sculpture from their own early history onto near contemporary Gaul, Lucan depicts a terrifying grove near Massilia, about to fall foul of Caesar's axe, where stood images of gods barely distinguishable from the trees on which they were carved: caesisque extant inform ia truncis (featureless &lt;statues&gt; protrude from hewn trunks, 3.412-13). Likewise Dio Chrysostom notes that many barbarians lacking in artistic skill resort to calling ôévôpa àpyà (unworked trees) gods (Orat. 12.61). These statues have barely left behind their status as trees, whilst conversely some trees are approached in ways which strongly paint them as statue-like. Offerings appear to be made to trees, as when clippings of the Vestal Virgins' hair are brought to a specific nettle tree (Nat. 16.235). They may also be accompanied by inscriptions, like an ancient holm oak on the Vatican with its attached bronze plaque engraved with Etruscan writing (Nat. 16.237). On inscriptions written directly into the bark of trees, see Kruschwitz (2010) 45-62. The planting of trees can also be figured in vocabulary reminiscent of statues, as when Horace uses statuere for the planting of a tree on his estate (C. 2.13): this verb very rarely has the meaning 'to plant' (OLD§ib), but is standardly used of statues meaning 'to erect' (OLD§4). Tree and statue are also visually conflated in Pausanias' snapshot of a wooden image of Artemis set up in a cedar tree (8.13.2), its context emphasising its closeness to arboreal form. Finally, pushing yet further at the boundaries of the tree-statue divide, Pausanias depicts a bronze statue of a palm tree, with imitation fruit and all (10. 15. 4): this statue of a tree also has a gilt image of Athena set on it, making this an arboreal and anthropomorphic statue all in one. 28 See Freedberg (1989) 73 who writes of wooden statues that 'the god in the tree prolongs his stay in those images which still remind their beholders of their arboreal origins'. Excerpting the concept of 'tree gods', this phenomenon of 'arboreal memories' in statues is exactly the one I wish to illustrate. 40</page><page sequence="13">AILSA HUNT jkus is nominative here, it must be understood 'in apposition to the ego contained in pepedi'.29 Priapus presents himself not as a figwood statue but as a figtree with buttocks. It is surely not coincidental that he favours this presentation at the very point when his dry wood splits with a deafening crack, leaving Priapus with conspicuous structural damage: Priapus reasserts an image of himself as organic living tree when such an image is likely to be farthest from the viewer's mind.30 Tree-like posing also has another major advantage for Priapus' self-presentation. Losing his penis is one of his recurrent fears (eg. Priap. 2, CP 55): jutting out at a jaunty angle, this would naturally have been the most vulnerable part of any of his statues. By presenting himself as an organically complete tree which has undergone minimal manufacture, rather than a statue fitted together from several wooden components, Priapus smooths over the worry that his penis could be a structural weakness.31 Indeed on another occasion he is open about this precise worry, and in audacious parody of 29 Brown (1993) 174. 30 Hallett (1981) 341-347 reads one meaning officus as dominant here, namely an anal wart supposedly gained from being anally penetrated (OLD§3), jokes about which often feature in priapic poetry (eg. CP 41). On her reading we can hear a characteristic, if implicit, reference to Priapus' threats of anal penetration and associated boasts of sexual prowess (the kind of behaviour which doles out such anal warts), which as we have seen are regularly made to compensate for admission of his wooden inadequacies. 31 Our understanding of the manufacture of wooden Priapus statues is almost entirely conjectural. A rare survival of wooden statues deposited at the Seine reveals just how simplistic such statues' construction could be, carved out of one piece of wood with the bare minimum of anthropomorphic detail. See Deyts (1983) for discussion and images of the find, of which he sums up one representative as a 'sculpture qui reste soumise à l'exiguïté de la branche dans laquelle elle est travaillée' (74). Confirming the simplicity of wooden statues, Pliny the Elder expresses surprise that there should be joins which need looking after in a wooden statue of Diana (Nat. 16.214). As to Priapus, Herter (1932) 5 suggests that a Priapus statue could have been carved out of a piece of naturally bifurcated wood (if conveniently split at an angle so as to simulate the god's erection and the trunk of his body), or that a separate branch could have been attached as the penis. Salviat (1964) 486-95 favours the bifurcation hypothesis in his discussion of certain amphora stamps which he believes depict herms of Priapus 'en zigzag', explaining that 'le corps sinueux et mince donne l'impression nette d'une structure ligneuse, d'une branche, fourchue au niveau du sexe' (488). Gow and Page (1965) 535-6 suggest in response to Priapus' 'legless' nature in AP 9.437 that such statues were made by carving a head and penis onto a log or stump. In AP 6.22 Priapus is described as povoaxóp0uyÇ, which the TLG explains as qui ex uno jactus est stipite (that which is made from one block), whilst the scholia to this line elucidate it as follows, érci évi rcoöi íaxápevoç (standing on one foot). As this is the adjective's only extant occurrence it is hard to ascribe a meaning to it with full confidence but its constituent parts, póvoç (single) and oxópÔuyÇ (spike), suggest that Priapus is conceived here as a pointed block. Cf. AP 10.8 featuring a cpo^óç (pointed) and aîtouç (footless) Priapus. Modern scholars tend to favour a one block hypothesis for the construction of Priapus statues, for which there is certainly ancient support, both literary and archaeological. I would not be surprised if several methods of constructing Priapus statues were in use, but Priapus certainly also favours the one block image, allowing him to present his penis as an integral component of his body. By way of contrast stone genitalia must normally have been attached separately to minimise wastage of material. 41</page><page sequence="14">PRJAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION 11. 1.234-6 and, in all likelihood, its Latin model at Aen. 12.206-11, describes his member as follows:32 hoc sceptrum, quod ab arbore est recisum nulla iam poterit virere fronde (CP 25.1-2) this sceptre, which was cut off a tree, will no longer be able to grow green with foliage. Priapus' penis is dead matter. Characteristically, he is quick to counter this self- degradation by an extravagant assertion of his sexual prowess, but images of his penis as separate component had an enduring imaginative effect: Prudentius mocks Priapus for his turpiter ramo ... adjìxo (shamefully fixed on branch, c.Symm. 115). Again Priapus engages with the worry that his penis might be a prosthetic attachment, but in an entirely different tone, when he boasts in Martial 6.49 that his penis is uiva generata de cupressu (born from a living cypress tree, 4). Thus Priapus blurs the transition from the time when his penis was part of a living tree to its current position as statue component, supporting this organic image by language of birth (generata) rather than construction.33 The author of Priap. 4 informs us that Priapus is accustomed to stand sub arboris coma (under the foliage of a tree) and indeed in visual representations, whether a fully anthropomorphic figure or a statue, Priapus is often accompanied by a tree, as seen in figure 1. Cult statues are frequently shaded by trees in literary and visual representations, so this is nothing particularly unusual in the case of Priapus statues. However, in the following representations I propose that Priapus statues interact with their customary tree in such a way as to express a unique relationship between them and their arboreal counterparts. In this I build on the work of Stewart who shows that statues of Priapus are frequently presented as 'growing' organically from the ground, standing on a miniature rocky outcrop in place of a traditional pedestal. This distinction is clearly seen when he analyses a marble relief from the House of the Coloured Capitals in Pompeii: Priapus on his stony mound is offset by a neighbouring statue posing on 32 Only a very early dating of the Carmina Priapea would preclude this allusion. See n. 13 on dating the collection. 33 Pausanias similarly describes a statue of Aphrodite as made of living myrtle (5.13.7), which surely has to be metaphorical unless the tree remained rooted when it was turned into a statue. In contrast, Minucius Felix deliberately gives wooden statues deathly associations, by selecting a pyre or gallows as examples of the type of source from which they might originate (Oct. 22). 42</page><page sequence="15">AILSA HUNT Fig i.

Photo: Fotografica Foglia 45</page><page sequence="18">PRIAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION mirrored by the angle of the tree's branches behind him. Indeed the tree is almost a shadow of Priapus. The visual alignment of the tree's trunk with Priapus' pedestal further downplays his identity as statue and reminds us of his arboreal origins: the branches which constitute his statue once grew out of such a trunk rather than a pedestal.37 In a painting of Polyphemus and Galatea from the House of the Priest Amandus in Pompeii a Priapus statue on a pedestal again observes the protagonists from the margins (figure 3). This time no tree shadows him, but the central tree against which Polyphemus leans forms the same angle with the uppermost fork of its trunk as does Priapus' body and his penis. Moreover, the branch aligned with Priapus' penis appears to have sheared off and is noticeably without foliage, just as Priapus once described his penis as a broken off branch which will no longer put forth leaves (CP 25.1-2). In a supporting role is the column behind the main tree, which interacts with the leaning tree so as to stand almost as an alternative trunk: this interplay of column and tree parallels and reinforces the blurring of statue and tree. By way of a final example, a wall painting from House 1. 12, 9 in Pompeii shows two Priapus statues on either side of an altar, with a huge tree towering behind their backs (figure 4). Again the trunk of the tree and a lopped off branch monumentalise the angle formed by the body and penis of its counterpart Priapl. The construction encircling the bottom of the tree also draws a horizontal line beneath the lopped off branch which replicates that drawn under the Priapi's penises by the tops of their pedestals: such mirroring reaffirms the essential affinity of Priapus statue and tree. To sum up, concern about Priapus' manufacture is sometimes expressed with deprecating frankness and sometimes with reticence, whether through the words of Priapus himself, through the words of humans engaging with him or through visual assimilations: the two emotional stances are not to be seen as contradictory but rather as different angles of engagement with this recurring conceptual concern. 37 It is hard to ascertain the material of the Priapus statues in figures 2-4. It is important to note, however, that we need not let their pedestals deter us from approaching them as wooden: Pausanias certainly knew of a wooden statue on a pedestal (2.14.3), an^ according to Athenaeus the wooden Hera of Samos also belonged on a pedestal (Deip. 15.11-15 = F. Gr. Hist. 541 Fi). I hold that these statues' visual assimilation to their accompanying trees, as well as the fact that wood is the material of choice when Priapus statues are depicted in literary rural settings, urges us to view them as wooden. Yet if these Priapus statues are meant to be depicted in materials other than wood, their shadowing by arboreal counterparts may have further implications, reminding the viewer of such statues' wooden forebears. 46</page><page sequence="19">Fig 4.

On the supposition that gods are immortal, there is much that is conceptually problematic about a wooden god daily exposed to the natural elements, liable to rot if too wet, to warp if subjected to extreme temperatures and always precariously flammable.38 Priapus' woodenness exacerbates and highlights worries about material vulnerability which would have coloured understanding of any statue- god.39 The chief disadvantage as to life expectancy which distinguishes wooden statues from stone or metallic statues is their flammability, and therefore it comes as no surprise to find that Priapus is pathologically pyrophobic. In Priap. i his dread of the ease with which his lignum (wood) could become i¿jnis (fire) is highlighted by the jingle of juxtaposing these almost anagrammatical words.40 nam frigus metuo et vereor, ne ligneus ignem hie deus ignavis praebeat agricolis (3-4) for I fear the frost and I am afraid that this wooden god might provide fire for coarse farmers. In Martial 8.40 the speaker of the epigram cruelly plays on this fear with a warning: fiiraces moneo manus repellas et silvam domini focis reserves: si defecerit haec, et ipse lignum es (4-6) 38 Indeed Pliny the Elder considers noteworthy Alexander Cornelius' report of an oak tree and its attached misdetoe which could not be destroyed by fire or water (Nat. 13. 119). Likewise wooden statues which could resist fire received great kudos. A wooden statue of Tullius which survived unscathed a conflagration of the temple of Fortune housing it was venerated by the Romans (D.H. 4.40.7), and a log which was actually Hermes Perpheraios in disguise was only recognised as the god by its refusal to burn as firewood (Dieg. Call.Iamb.7). 39 Priapus' transitory woodenness stands in stark contrast to the impression given by stone or metallic statues, described by Woolf (2001) 126 as follows: 'the very solidity and apparent permanence of images in stone or metal evoked a sense of unchanging cosmic order and a power that was both transcendent and immanent'. 40 Rand (1919) 130 captures this jingle: 'winter gives him a chilling fear that despite his divinity, some lazy rustic may turn the ligneous god into igneous fuel'. 48</page><page sequence="21">AILSA HUNT I warn you to ward off thieving hands and to preserve the wood for your master's hearth: if it runs out, you yourself are wood. If Priapus does not maintain the standards required of his role as firewood custodian he will be firewood himself: the present tense in the conditional's apodosis underlines the ease of this transition and its lack of consequence for Priapus' master.41 Priapus' nightmare of going up in smoke even makes its presence felt in his most rambunctious moods, as in Martial 6.73: aspice quam certo uidear non ligneus ore nec deuota focis inguinis arma geram, sed mihi perpetua numquam moritura cupresso Phidiaca rigeat méntula digna manu (5-8). Look how I appear non-wooden with my features distinct and how I do not carry a groin-weapon doomed to the hearth, but my immortal penis, worthy of Phidias' handiwork, stands erect, made of eternal cypress. Due to the quality of his cypress, this Priapus ironically claims to escape the embarrassing appearance of being wooden: with the associated threat of death by burning thus elided, he can trumpet his divine immortality. Whether anxious or boasting, Priapus is always well aware that, in Stewart's words, he is incongruously posing 'halfway between divinity and firewood'.42 Shifting the focus from death by fire to natural decline over time, another cypress Priapus in Martial boasts that the quality of his wood will save him from cariem ... 41 As persuasively argued by Fitzgerald (2007) 134-5 there is an ironic parallel between this epigram and the preceding one: the dissolution of Priapus' divinity is contrasted with the imagined deification of Domitian in 8.39. Fitzgerald analyses how this juxtaposition undermines Domitian's godhead, but the two-way process also reinforces Priapus' lowly status, who unlike Domitian does not even receive tongue in cheek flattery as a potential divinity, but instead is abruptly cut down to size. I am grateful to an anonymous reader of CCJ for the observation that this juxtaposition also implicates Priapus in wider debates and concerns about humans 'creating' gods. 42 Stewart (2002) 76. Early Christian apologists somewhat hero worshipped Diagoras as a pagan insightful enough to realise the true worth of wooden statues, relishing the anecdote in which he put a wooden statue of Heracles on the fire in order to speed up the boiling of some turnips (eg. Athenagoras, Leg. 4.1). On Christian penchant for the story see Finney (1994) 48-9. 49</page><page sequence="22">PRJAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION senectae (the decay of old age, 6.49. 6).43 In characteristic tone he boasts that his penis does not fear the passing of the centuries because it is not made I igno . . . quolibet (from any old wood, 3), but is viva generata de cupressu (born from living cypress, 4): this is a wood to counteract Priapus' customary fears about his life expectancy, but whose spectre is raised even in their cancellation by the self-conscious humour of ascribing the mental state of fearing to a penis. Indeed Priapus' optimism about his future is strongly determined by his wood. Cypress was renowned in the ancient world for its long life (eg. Nat. 16.212, Thphr., CP 5.4.2), and consequently Martial's two cypress Priapi can largely dismiss the fears of mortality which plague other Priapl.44 In contrast, the figwood Priapi whom we meet in Horace S. 1.8 and API. 86 are both disparagingly critical of their personal appearance.45 Such insecurity is hardly surprising considering figwooďs reputation for its brevissima vita (very short life, Nat. 16.241), its senectus ocissima (very swift old age, Nat. 16.130) and its senescendi celeritas (speed of ageing, Nat. 17.155).46 Priapus' self-deprecating presentation of his manufacture finds its match in his insecurities about his approaching end, whether hastened on by fire or his wood's insufficiencies. Conclusion A few lines preceding his tirade against the manufacture of pagan gods, Minucius Felix sets out the basics as to what constitutes a divinity: divinum autem id est, quod nec ortum nec occasum habet (that is divine, which has neither birth nor death, Oct. 21). Surely no pagan ever felt troubled by quite such a stark definition of the divine when conceptualising their statues of the gods, which were, after all, ambiguously divine objects. Yet pagan lack of precision in representing the ontological status of such « Wooden statues which managed to escape decay were singled out for praise (eg. Nat. 14.9 on a vine wood statue of Jupiter which remained tot aevis incorruptum (undecayed for many ages). Naturally enough, long lasting woods were sought out for statues of the gods, Pliny the Elder describing the aeternitas (eternal life) of a particular type of cedar and its corresponding popularity for divine images. 44 See Meiggs (1982) 313 on the preeminence of cypress as a sculpture wood. 45 Theocritus' legless and noseless figwood Priapus is also very much brought down to size (Ep. 4). 46 See O'Connor (1989) 83 on the low status of figwood. Theophrastus notes that figwood is easy to bend (CP 5.6.2), and it may be significant that Pliny excludes fig from his list of woods which do not split of their own accord (Nat. 16.212): it would be hard not to see Priapus' behaviour as again informed by his wood when Horace's figwood Priapus splits his buttocks in a fart (S. 1.8.46-7), on which see Brown (1993) 174. Meiggs (1982) 324 writes that when constructing a Priapus statue 'no special attention would be paid to the choice of woods', but authors depicting wooden Priapus statues were certainly not indifferent to this choice, as seen in the strong correlation between Priapus' psychological state and his constituent wood. 50</page><page sequence="23">AILSA HUNT statues should not prevent us from understanding their manufacture and destruction, or birth and death, to have been perceived as theologically problematic. Indeed study of wooden Priapus has revealed just how insistently pagans could toy with these conceptual issues. With his modern reputation for being a less than weighty divinity, wooden Priapus is in need of rehabilitation as a god worthy of more serious theological consideration: ironically, or perhaps fittingly, the issues of manufacture and destruction which urge us to this re-consideration must be confronted through the jokes, mockery and farcical caricature by which pagans so often engaged with this wooden god. Appendix Responding to awareness of Priapus' penchant for assimilating himself to a tree, I suggest a re-interpretation of CP 61. What ostensibly occurs in this poem is that an apple tree, weighed down with bad poems, justifies its lack of produce to its owner. Parker starkly concludes: 'this poem is not a priapeum'.47 Yet if we read CP 61 in close conjunction with the preceding poem, there is no reason not to hear the T of the poem as the voice of Priapus.48 In CP 60 the poet addresses Priapus: si quot habes versus, tot haberes poma, Priape, esses antiquo ditior Alcinoo. If you were to have as many apples as you have verses, Priapus, you would be richer than Alcinous of old. It is a common motif for Priapus to have verses pinned onto his statue or the walls of his shrine, and here we are asked to imagine Priapus as such, and then to substitute those imagined verses with apples.49 With the image fresh in mind of Priapus laden down with apples, we proceed to CP 61 in which purportedly an apple tree addresses us. It does seem odd, however, for there to be just one poem in this collection neither spoken by Priapus nor about Priapus.50 Moreover, the speaking voice in CP 61 is remarkably close to that of Priapus elsewhere in the collection, as he gets involved in 47 Parker (1988) 163. To my knowledge the view that the speaker of this poem is an apple tree has not previously been challenged. Uden (2010) 202-3 has very recently reasserted the standard view. 48 Parker (1988) 38-9 emphasises the intentional ordering of the Carmina Priapea. 49 Eg. CP 2 and CP 49. 50 1 cannot accept the claim of Parker (1988) 41 that Priapus is 'not really relevant' in CP 19. 51</page><page sequence="24">PRIAPUS AS WOODEN GOD: CONSTRUCTING MANUFACTURE AND DESTRUCTION an implied debate with his master about his responsibilities and comments on the quality of verse he receives from poets.51 Just as Priapus presents himself as a talking tree in Priap. 2, Priap. 3 and Horace S. 1.8, what is to prevent us from hearing Priapus speaking as an apple tree in CP 61?52 Once he was a bene fiuctuosa malus (pleasingly fruitful apple tree, CP 61.2) but, so the joke goes, he is no longer fruitful because he is weighed down not with apples but with awful poems, just like the poem-laden Priapus of the preceding epigram. This is a crop of which no discerning literary critic would be proud: since he stopped being a tree and became a statue Priapus has been, as it were, 'male jructuosus'. Responding to CP 60, in which we are asked to make a mental substitution of verses for apples, in CP 61 Priapus hints at a reverse narrative in which he himself substituted apples for verses. His admission of sterility is also characteristic, mirroring his concern in CP 25 that his penis is no longer fruitful, unlike the tree from which it came: in CP 61 sterility cripples the whole of the one-time tree. The obvious objection to my reading of CP 61 is that the speaker refers to features which might seem exclusive to him being identified with a tree, namely buds and branches. However, it should be noted that lines 4-12, in which the reference to buds occurs, constitute a ręfutatio dismissing certain phenomena as factors contributing to the speaker's sorry state: it is not the case that a late chill nipped his buds (6-7). Indeed we can read this whole ręfutatio as a rebuttal to the farmer's complaints that he is no longer fruitful (1-3): this is hardly his fault, Priapus claims, because he is not actually a tree anymore, but a statue. On this model, Priapus' final reference to supporting poems on his 'branches' jokes on the multivalence of the word ramus, which blurs the gap between arboreal and human form by meaning both branch and arm.53 Priapus is here posing as a tree-like but at the same time anthropomorphic statue, a stance with which we are by now familiar. AILSA HUNT QUEENS' COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE 51 In Priap. 2 a farm overseer overrides Priapus' supposed role by chasing off thieves for him (19-21). In CP 56 Priapus delegates his role as irrumating scarecrow to his master (5-6) and in CP 77 he shows no commitment whatsoever to his traditional guardian duties but remonstrates with his master for erecting a fence which keeps out sexy thieves (1-3). Priapus demands poetry in CP 41 and CP 47, specifying in CP 41 that it should be humorous (20), to the implicit exclusion of works by erudite poets (3-4). 52 The speaking trees of the Nux and the Anthologia Palatina (eg. 9.3, 9.247 and 9.563) all support this reading of CP 61. If we are to understand poma as apples rather than generic fruits, then the fact that Priapus receives these as offerings in CP 16, CP 21, CP 53 and Priap. 1 would make it fitting for him to originate from an apple tree. 53 On the blurring between trees and people see the classic discussion of Nisbet (1987) 243-4 an" Gowers (2005) 334-6 for a further collation of the ancient evidence. 52</page><page sequence="25">AILSA HUNT WORKS CITED Ando, C.
