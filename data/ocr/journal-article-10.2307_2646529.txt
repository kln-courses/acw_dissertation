<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gender, Race, and Semicolonialism: Liu Na'ou's Urban Shanghai Landscape SHU-MEI SHIH Mr. Na'ou is a sensitive urban man. With his special talent, he wields a sharp scalpel to dissect airplanes, movies, jazz, skyscrapers, eroticism, the high speed of long- bodied cars, and the mass production of modern life.... We especially recommend Mr. Liu Na'ou's style. The freshness of his style is unprecedented and best reflects our times. From him we can learn new literary techniques, new artistic forms, new tunes, as well as disjointed and tortuous syntax. (La nouvelle litte'rature 1930)' In 1924 a half-Taiwanese, half-Japanese man travelled from Japan to Shanghai to study French at the Jesuit Universite L'Aurore. He was young, flamboyant, and rich, and eventually used his own personal funds to found two bookstores and three journals in Shanghai. Despite his ambiguous national identity and lack of formal Chinese education, he also became the founder of a Chinese modernist literary movement called new sensationism (xinganjue pai), earned substantial notoriety, and attracted a host of followers. Murdered by an unidentified assassin in 1939, in his short life Liu Na'ou (1900-39) mirrored the literary movement that he created and that died with him. But this was not before he had published an intriguing collection of short stories entitled Scene (his own French title, 1930a), which was in some measure to define Shu-mei Shih is assistant professor of modern Chinese literature and Asian American literature at the University of California, Los Angeles. This article is part of a book manuscript in preparation tentatively entitled The Lure of the Modern: WVriting Modernism in Semicolonial China. I would like to acknowledge my dissertation advisor, Professor Leo Ou-fan Lee, for guiding me through both the writing of the dissertation and my continuing efforts at revision. Professors Theodore Huters, Leslie Pincus, Gail Her- shatter, Lisa Rofel, as well as friends Meng Yue and Yibing Huang have read an earlier version of this paper, and have given illuminating comments. All blemishes in this paper remain my own however. My research in China (1990-9 1) was supported by a Fulbright grant and a grant from the Committee on Scholarly Communication with China. This project was also supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the Center for Chinese Studies at UC, Berkeley (1992-93).

In this paper I ask questions regarding cultural constructions of gender, race, and national identity in relation to semicolonialism in Liu Na'ou's work by examining the specific representations of the Westernized "modern girl," whose Chinese incarnation embodies elements of exotic women from both Franco-Japanese literary sources and Hollywood icons. I begin with a brief discussion of gender and race politics in postcolonial theory that deals with the representation of Westernized women, in order to contrast its politics with the semicolonial politics of gender and race in Shanghai in general, and Liu Na'ou's representation of these issues in particular. I point out the tendency in postcolonial theory to link discussions of gender and race politics in the colonial setting, often exclusively, with nationalism, and propose a reconsideration of this link in the semicolonial context of Shanghai by questioning the 'given-ness' of nationalism. I find the partial, multiple, and fragmentary domination of semicolonialism and its colonial racism often displaced in the putatively "cosmopolitan" imagining of Shanghai. This cosmopolitan imaginary sanctioned a strategy of displacement which bifurcated the discursive (writings about modernity and race in reference to discourses in the metropolitan West and its honorary member, Japan) and the material (modernity and racism as colonial constructs). I argue that this harkens back to the May Fourth cultural enlightenment discourse where a similar bifurcation operated in its construction of the role and function of "the West": modern, metropolitan Western culture as the object of emulation (discursive) and the imperialist presence of the West in China as the object of nationalist critique (material). In this bifurcation, the discursive was valorized over the material due to the perceived urgency of the cultural enlightenment project, hence nationalism did not necessarily undergird cultural articulations. Furthermore, to make the discursive work, the material often had to be rendered invisible from a principled position.2 This bifurcation was a useful strategy that helped legitimate the cosmopolitan enlightenment ideology so that the search for "civilization" in the Western mode3 need not be hampered by the existence of Western imperialism in China. In the absence of nationalism, semicolonial formulations of gender and race in Shanghai as seen in Liu's work did not characteristically endorse patriarchy, nor did they ostensibly repudiate racism; instead, they saw the Westernized "modern girl" as a desirable embodiment of antipatriarchal, autonomous, urban, and hybrid modernity. Following the discussion of semicolonial politics of race and gender, I provide a short genealogy of Liu Na'ou's life and work in relation to Japanese new sensationism (shinkankakuha) and French exoticist literature. I then begin to examine in detail the decoupling of nationalism with the politics of gender and race. I argue that the alienated urban man commonly portrayed in modernist writing has a contradictory relationship with the semicolonial city-the embodiment of the material which destabilizes his subjectivity by both seducing and rejecting him, and that his response 2This of course does not mean that the May Fourth intellectuals did not adopt Western styles, such as Western suits or hairdos, in everyday life. What I emphasize is that the justi- fication for Westernization needed to separate the metropolitan West as a source of cultural enlightenment from the colonial West as the agent of imperialism. In this regard, the donning of Western styles would also be justified as attributes of the metropolitan, and not necessarily the colonial, West. For a more detailed analysis of this strategy of bifurcation, see Shih 1996. 3For a discussion of the pursuit of "Civilization" in the Western mode by Shanghai exo- ticist writers and artists such as Shao Xunmei and Zhu Yingpeng, see Heinrich Freuhauf 1993.</page><page sequence="3">936 SHU-MEI SHIH to such rejection lacked nationalist overtones. But here, the semicolonial reality is no longer displaced as vigilantly as in May Fourth enlightenment discourse and begins to filter into the more urban construction of modernity: the physical settings of the city such as the cabaret, the theatre, and the racetrack are the sites of action and narration. Liu's innovative language and syntax grace these sites with a sensuous and seductive allure, self-consciously creating a myriad new sensations that Liu would characterize as distinct experiences of the urban-hence the modernist namesake, new sensationism. I then conclude my discussion with a sustained examination of the osmosis between the semicolonial city and the modern girl in Liu's fiction. I argue that the modern girl's excessive materiality unsettles the bifurcation between the discursive and the material, and that her representation rather exemplifies a discursive attempt to confront the material without necessarily taking a nationalist or masculinist stance. This shows how the Shanghai cosmopolitanism project, unlike the May Fourth antecedent, acknowledged semicolonial urban materiality as part of the constitution of modernity. But the modern girl's illusiveness may ultimately suggest that the desire for this urban modernity was yet to be fulfilled. Colonial and Semicolonial Politics of Gender and Race It has been noted that scholarship on China during the Cold War era insisted that China was a "noncolonial" nation, thereby "displacing" the need to examine colonialism. In contrast, recent scholarship has aimed first to introduce colonialism as an important category of analysis and then to define semicolonialism as a colonial formation specific to the Chinese situation (Barlow 1993, 224-67). For the few scholars engaged in this effort, theories of colonialism and postcolonialism based on South Asian, African, and Caribbean experiences have been influential but have been perceived to have limited applicability to the Chinese context. In this effort, Gail Hershatter's rethinking of South Asian postcolonial theory, particularly of the concept of the "subaltern," in light of the specific condition of semicolonialism in China, is most noteworthy (Hershatter 1993, 103-30). I continue this rethinking of postcolonial theory by examining semicolonialism and semicolonial gender and race politics, providing important contextual information and analytical tools for reading Liu Na'ou's work, while at the same time "provincializing" postcolonial theory in the manner it has earlier proposed to "provincialize" Europe's hegemonic discourse of history and modernity (Chakrabarty 1992, 1-26). I find that much of postcolonial theory acknowledges three general assumptions about gender and race relations in colonial situations: (1) the fact of racialized colonial domination and the resulting confused condition of cultural and racial identity for the colonized who must resist colonial racism; (2) the gender implications of colonialism as the emasculation of the colonized male, hence the tendency to counter such emasculating force by constructing an equally, if not more, masculinist nationalism, as in the famous conception of "hypermasculinity" (Nandy 1983, 1-63); (3) the tendency to deploy "women" as signifiers of nationhood, as "victims of social backwardness, icons of modernity or privileged bearers of cultural authenticity," which further subject women to patriarchal nationalist imaginary (Kandiyoti 1994, 378). In these assumptions, the conflict between the colonizer and the colonized is chiefly seen as the struggle of men against men; women either serve that struggle or are left out</page><page sequence="4">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 937 entirely. On the one hand, if the colonial struggle is troped as a "heterosexual" conquest of the feminized native men by the masculine colonizer, the colonized native women become an irrelevant third term in the struggle. On the other hand, the persistent patriarchal representation of women in the service of nationalist imaginary also discounts the actual varied experiences of women under colonialism. In general, in the name of nationalism, patriarchal dictates absorbed discussions of race and gender politics under colonialism. Two brief but representative examples that specifically deal with Westernized native women in the nationalist imaginary of the colonized will suffice to illustrate how the above gender and race assumptions operate. For instance, Franz Fanon's seminal text extremely influential for postcolonial theorists, Black Skin, White Masks (1952), well illustrates the subsumption of women's issues by the nationalist patriarchy. In this text, Fanon works with an implicit masculinist supposition that denigrates Westernized native women in the Antilles as complicit with colonialism in doubling the emasculation of the native male. He does this by way of analyzing the desire of Westernized native women to be wooed by and eventually to marry white men, and their rejection of black men as potential marriage partners. Fanon describes this process of gaining white acceptance as "bleaching" and "lactation," finding it a "nauseating phenomenon," especially when the subjects are educated, Westernized black or mulatto women (Fanon 1952, chap. 2). Unlike his in-depth analysis of a similar desire for white acceptance among black men as the result of the psychosocial effects of colonialism, and therefore representing their honor as wronged but nevertheless sovereign national subjects, his value-ridden, accusatory treatment of Westernized native women is strikingly unequivocal. Obsessed with the question of manhood under colonialism, Fanon presumes black women to be traitors who furthered the oppression of black men. In so doing he exposes the patriarchal underpinning of his anticolonial discourse (Chow 1995, 5-29). Partha Chatterjee's typology of three kinds of women in nineteenth-century Indian nationalist discourse offers further insight into the procedures by which Westernized women are denigrated. In order of hierarchy, the lowest rung was occupied by the "common women," the maidservants, washer women, barbers, prostitutes, and other such women who were considered "coarse, vulgar, quarrelsome, devoid of superior moral sense," and "sexually promiscuous"; on the next rung were the "Westernized women" (the memsahebs), who came from wealthy parvenu families with colonial connections and who were seen as "brazen, avaricious, irreligious," and "sexually promiscuous," like the common women; on the highest rung were the "new women" (the new bhadramahila), a nationalist construction, closely monitored by the new native patriarchy-hence, although educated in Western knowledge, they maintained all feminine virtues and were barred from becoming "essentially Westernized." Such distinctions among the types of women in nationalist discourse, Chatterjee argues, were due to the fact that nationalist ideology dichotomized the "home" (the uncolonized, the spiritual) and the "world" (the colonized, the material). It was crucial to designate "new women" who were worthy of the role of proprietor of the spiritual domain of the "home," and to guard the home against "common women" and "Westernized women" in the "world" who were vulgar and immoral manifestations of Western materialism and colonialism (Chatterjee 1993, 116-57). Like educated Westernized black women in Fanon's Antilles, "Westernized women" in Bengal, by their transgressive behavior and unacceptable outlook on life, embodied the threat to native identity, the threat of men losing control of the domestic realm, and above all, the threat of native men seeing in them a double of themselves</page><page sequence="5">938 SHU-MEI SHIH (Chatterjee notes that men were forced to become Westernized and materialistic in order to cope with the "world"). The native male's fear of becoming too Westernized was displaced as the rejection of Westernized women and the passion to maintain in new women" the embodiment of Indian spirituality. In formally colonized sites such as the Antilles and India, then, Westernized women in the discourse of native intelligentsia represented both the invasion of colonial ideology into the domestic sphere and the threat to native manhood and identity. The Westernized woman's transgressive behavior, predominantly troped as her sexual promiscuity, threatened to destroy the boundaries native men police: their property, their possessions, and their rights as men (especially the right to possess native women's sexuality). Ultimately, then, the Westernized woman was charged with complicity with the colonial regime's emasculation of native manhood. But the charge against her was not at all in proportion to the crime itself (the male intelligentsia were as guilty of the crime of being Westernized); rather, it was merely indicative of the nationalist patriarchy's monopolization of discursive power within the colonized domain. In sum, the coupling of anticolonial nationalism and gender politics has persistently inscribed Westernized women as transgressors of racial and sexual boundaries, and thereby the agents of crimes against the nation.4 Reflecting on the above assumptions of gender and race politics in postcolonial theory has led me to the following considerations. (1) Semicolonialism as a different mode of colonial control operates through fragmented, multiple, or multilayered forms of domination, as I explain below. Hence the strategies used to deal with colonial culture and colonial racism are quite different, and the positions of the subject within this fragmentary, multilayered colonial structure cannot be assumed in any Manichean fashion. (2) The complex trajectory of Liu Na'ou's identity opens up the question of cultural and racial/ethnic identity and how it operated within the semicolonial setting. (3) Liu's ambivalent national identity also challenges the undisputed presence of a masculinist nationalist imagination, and raises instead the prospect of an antipodal relationship between modernism-as the literary product of immigrants a la Raymond Williams (Williams 1989, 31-35)-and nationalism. (4) Finally, if the absence of a masculinist nationalist imagination is part of what constitutes semicolonial cultural politics, of what does "woman," in this case, the "modern girl" become a signifier? These questions, which the rest of the paper engages, not only problematizes the postcolonial paradigms of race and gender politics, but also undermines a homogeneous reading of the projects of modernity in different Third World locations as a predictable set of reactive and "reactional" responses to colonization. What then constitutes semicolonialism, and in what forms does its gender and race politics manifest itself? Republican China has been variously called a "semicolony" (ban zhimindi) and a "subcolony" (ci zhimindi) because of the obvious limitation of applying the term "colony" to China. "Semicolony" has been employed since the 1920s by Marxist critics, including Mao Zedong, as a way to describe the simultaneous coexistence of colonial and native feudal structures. Hence the other half of the "semicolonial" is the "semifeudal." "Subcolony," on the other hand, was coined by Sun Yat-sen to designate the worse-than-colony situation of China, because the Chinese were not just the "slaves of one country, but of all" (Sun 1950, 41). As they competed and intermittently cooperated with each other for power and profits, 4From a different angle, feminist scholars have critiqued the masculinist assumptions of nationalism as a "fraternity of men" (Benedict Anderson's term) and its subjugation of women. See for instance, Parker et al., 1992.</page><page sequence="6">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 939 eighteen foreign nations forced China at gunpoint to grant them extraterritorial rights in some fifty treaty ports beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. But unlike other colonized Third World nations, China was never systematically colonized, and thus lacked a central colonial government implementing extensive colonial institutions and structures. Paul Cohen therefore describes the Chinese colonial experience as partial, multiple, and layered (Cohen 1984, 144-45). A further limitation to the concept of colonialism in the Chinese context lies in its inadequacy to describe the rivalry among multifarious imperialist powers. Besides the multiple relationship of domination between the foreign powers and China (for which "colonialism" is insufficient), the relationship of rivalry and cooperation among the foreign powers in China (to which "colonialism" does not refer at all), also needs to be considered. That is, the multiple and multilayered colonization of China by competing foreign powers vying for more power and profit resulted in specific colonial experiences. If we posit that a degree of "care" had to be exercised by an imperial nation in its formal colony in order to assure the quantity and quality of production serving the imperial center, the absence of such "care" in China coupled with intra- imperialist rivalry and cooperation had the effect of snowballing exploitations. Sun Yat-sen argued, for instance, that if a formal colony encountered natural disasters such as famine and flood, the imperial nation would feel obligated to offer relief as befitting the role of the master. But when northern China suffered from a natural disaster in the early 1920s, no imperial nation saw it as its obligation to provide relief (Sun 1950, 39-40). On the other hand, however, the absence of a tight-fitting colonial structure also afforded Chinese intellectuals ideological, political, and cultural options beyond the typical Manichean choices of anticolonial nationalism or antinationalist collaboration. This was the case throughout modern Chinese cultural history, when a multiplicity of intellectual positions largely reflected the state of emergency-and the state of emergence-of modern Chinese consciousness. The May Fourth enlightenment project, for instance, had an ambivalent relationship with nationalism: enlightenment was heavily encoded as a form of antifeudalism and pro-Westernism, so the enlightenment thinker was not so much a nationalist as a self-appointed cultural critic and cultural vanguard. It was this ambivalent relationship between the cultural critic and nationalism that opened the possibility for multiple perspectives. My use of "semicolonialism" in this paper reinscribes existing discussions of the term to mean the following: "Semicolonialism" as a discursive context designates both the multiple intellectual positions available due to both a fragmented colonial structure and the urgency of the appointed task of antitraditional cultural criticism via pro-Westernism, in tension with the material existence of multilayered colonial domination.5 In the specific context of Shanghai in the late 1920s and early 1930s, before the League of Leftwing Writers began to exert extensive control, culture was very much commercialized; something akin to a "literary industry" arose (Shih 1992, 164-84). This commodity economy legitimated cultural production that obscured the high/ low or serious/popular literary divide, that displayed sumptuous cultural capital as a measure of its commercial worth, and that, most importantly, did not present strong ideological positions. Hence we witnessed the market success of such popular writers as Zhang Ziping (1893-1959) and Zhang Yiping (1902-46), and the exuberant, decadent, exoticist pomp in the art and life-style of such cultural figures as Shao Xunmei (1906-68). The new sensationist school of writing, largely initiated by Liu 5For a sustained analysis of semicolonialism as a distinct colonial formation, see Shih 1996.</page><page sequence="7">940 SHU-MEI SHIH Na'ou in the late 1920s, proposed to write in a mode that celebrated writing for its own sake. In the self-conception of writers such as Liu Na'ou, therefore, it was possible to be a writer without a stable ideological, cultural, or even national, identity. Coupled with the fragmentation of both colonial control and the authority of the Guomindang government-visually manifested in the division of Shanghai into three independent jurisdictions whose different levels of tolerance formed sanctuaries from unitary ideological control, and where a "strategic use of law" (Lee 1995, 5) was possible- the city was a site of relative cultural flexibility. However, this by no means should be extolled as benevolent imperial powers bestowing cultural "freedom" to the Chinese but rather should be seen as the paradoxical emergence of culture in the fissures between different agents of control whose authority did not overlap.6 Caution against celebrating the "freedom" of Shanghai's semicolonial cultural context is also borne out of the disjuncture between the discursive construction of the liberating potential of Occidentalism (the emulation of the metropolitan West and Japan) and the material condition of the city (the colonial West, and later, Japan). Since the May Fourth movement, the presence of "the West" in the enlightenment imaginary was largely "positive" in that it was embraced as a corrective to the supposed inadequacy of Chinese tradition in the modern world, but its material presence in Shanghai was embodied in the colonizers and the exploitative industrial culture they produced. The materiality of this colonial West was obvious in the racial hierarchization of the city,7 the modern conveniences built exclusively for the colonizers, and the cordoning off of spaces preventing Chinese entry. Everyday life in Shanghai, as Wen-hsin Yeh and Frederic Wakeman argue, was "suffused with ambivalence" for the Chinese intelligentsia, daily experiencing both an adoration of Western culture and a loathing of the foreign imperialists (Yeh and Wakeman 1992, 1-14). Colonial racism was part and parcel of the political and material construction of foreign Shanghai. Racism against the Chinese was endorsed by a series of unequal treaties and arbitrary laws since the Treaty of Nanjing was signed in 1842. It was probably most strongly felt and most commonly exercised, however, on the level of day-to-day contact, or lack thereof, between Chinese and Shanghailanders (foreign residents of Shanghai). As Marie-Claire Bergere pointed out, "humiliation showed up at every crossroad" for the Chinese residents of the city, in the "brutality of a policeman," or the "grimace of a blond child" (Bergere 1981, 13). Many of these Shanghailanders were criminals and undesirables, such as opium traffickers, gamblers, prostitutes, and quack-evangelists who committed such crimes as petty larceny, terror, murder, fraud, and vagrancy (Ch'en 1979, 213-16). According to two separate reports by a British visitor and a scholar, this foreign community was not intellectual, was not interested in culture, and considered it a "sin" to be friendly with a Chinese and "utterly ridiculous" to marry one. In foreign commercial buildings, Chinese were forced to use a separate lift; on French-controlled trams, they were not allowed to ride 6Poshek Fu also writes about Shanghai's paradoxical experience of modernity: "Republican Shanghai's experience with modernity was full of ambiguity: it represented a new commodity culture offering rich possibilities for individual development on the one hand and an imperialist regime of terror and exploitation on the other" (Fu 1993, 165). 7One event that threatened to destabilize the racial hierarchy in Shanghai was the entrance of white Russian women into the thriving prostitution industry (there were about 48,000 prostitutes within the 12.5 square miles of the settlements in 1929), who served both Western and Chinese clientele. By 1935, 25,000 Russian women were living in Shanghai (Ch'en 1979, 213-16; Hershatter 1989, 493-98).</page><page sequence="8">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 941 in the first-class compartment; no Chinese, except as guests of foreigners, were admitted to foreign clubs; and, except for domestic servants and city employees, Chinese were barred from entering the Public Garden (Huangpu Park) and other recreation grounds, the upkeep for which Chinese helped to pay (Ransome 1927, 142-49; Ch'en 1979, 232-33). Nicholas Clifford notes that Chinese contributed 55 percent of all taxes and rates in the International Settlement, but were barred from using the most modern and best equipped hospitals, and were given very little voice in its governance. Foreign Shanghai therefore looked like "parasites on the body of China" that only took without giving, serving only as "channels through which the country's wealth passed on its way to enrich London and Tokyo, New York, and Paris" (Clifford 1991, 25-27). Although colonial racism as part of the material reality of the semicolonial city was infused in one's daily life as a visual, physical, and psychological experience, the Chinese discourse of race studies, eugenics, mainly centered in Shanghai in the 1930s, did not take colonial racism into consideration in any integrated way. Instead, the perception of the white race in that discourse was more often than not as the pure race that naturally commanded superiority. Some said that the Chinese were like the white race in that they were pure; others said that the original Chinese, the Xia, were actually similar to Caucasians in physical features; while there were also others who responded to Western racist anthropology and contested white superiority (Dikotter 1992, 132-90). Despite their differences, all these treatments of race ignored the concrete manifestations of colonial racism and instead adopted eugenics as a Western discourse potentially beneficial to China, again continuing May Fourth valorization of the discursively constructed metropolitan West and the displacement of the materially constructed colonial West. The bifurcation of the discursive and material contexts of the question of race and racism was a crucial characteristic of semicolonial cultural politics, where the intellectual could actually ignore the existence of racism if s/he so chose since it was fairly contained within the concessions, while at the same time engaging in a discourse of race heavily indebted to race theories from the West. Fragmented Shanghai then, kept back colonial racism from becoming hegemonic to the extent of thoroughly oppressing the Chinese intellectual, and racism could be easily displaced by a cosmopolitan celebration of the culture of the metropolitan West and Japan. Hence, ironically, racial hierarchy often remains either unproblematized or merely replicated in some of Liu Na'ou's stories, and the material culture of the West, as it is present in Shanghai, becomes transformed into an alluring urban modernity embodied in the figure of the modern girl. The Alienated Individual in the Semicolonial City The Shanghai in which Liu Na'ou found himself upon arrival in 1924 was inhabited mainly by immigrants from other parts of the country (Yeh and Wakeman 1992). Born of a Taiwanese father, a Japanese mother, and raised in Japan, Liu Na'ou was well-versed in both modern Japanese and French literature, and spoke the fluent Japanese of the Tokyoites, but his Chinese was heavily accented. After completing a university education in Japan, he arrived in Shanghai to attend the special two-year French program at the French Jesuit Universite L'Aurore. Among his classmates were Dai Wangshu (1905-50), Shi Zhicun (b.1905), and Du Heng (1907-64), with whom he would later initiate a modernist movement. At the time, his written Chinese was reportedly rather awkward, prompting Shi Zhicun to note decades later that Liu</page><page sequence="9">942 SHU-MEI SHIH initially wrote Chinese as if he were writing Japanese (Shi 1984, 51-54). Leftist literary critics from the 1930s on would seize upon the "un-Chinese" quality of his writing to delegitimize modernist writing in general. Native-born Mu Shiying (1912- 40), who followed Liu's style, came under the same kind of attack. But this departure from authentic "Chinese-ness" itself had been part of the aesthetic agenda of Shanghai modernist fiction from its inception. As a cosmopolitan literary project heavily drawn from French and Japanese antecedents, Shanghai modernism prided itself in writing fiction that interweaved urban, exotic, and erotic motifs rendered in experimental style and form that supposedly knew no national boundaries. After a visit to Japan in 1926, Liu returned to Shanghai in 1928 with a library of books, including stories by Kawabata Yasunari, Yokomitsu Riichi, and Tanizaki Jun'ichiro. With his own funds and with the help of his classmates, he immediately opened a publishing house called Frontier Bookstore (Diyixian Shudian), which published such works as Erotic Culture (Seqing Wenhua), a translated collection of Japanese new sensationist works. When the bookstore was banned by the Nationalist government for allegedly promoting left-leaning publications, Liu moved his publishing activities first to the International Settlement and then to the French Concession. There he started the Waterfoam Bookstore (Shuimo Shudian), which again published the work of, among others, Japanese new sensationists, most notably a collection of Yokomitsu's stories entitled The Sensations of the Bridegroom (Xinlang de Ganxiang). During this time, he also financed and edited two influential literary journals, Trackless Train (Wugui Lieche, 1928) and La nouvelle litterature (Xin Wenyi, 1929-30), wrote his famous collection of short stories, Scene, and translated the works of Japanese new sensationism and French writer Paul Morand (1888-1976). Later he turned to writing film scripts, ran a journal called Modern Cinema (Xiandai Dianying) and even produced a film version of La dame aux camajas at the Guangming studio in 1938, a year before his assassination. It is not known exactly who sent the assassin, and varying conjectures point to such diametrically opposed parties as the Guomindang (for Liu's alleged sympathy for leftist causes and for taking on the editorship of Wenhui Daily run by the puppet government of Wang Jingwei), the Chinese Communist Party (for working for the Japanese), and the Green Gang (for his connection with the underground and related to his "decadent" life style). If anything, the disagreement over the identity of his killer points to Liu's own fundamental ideological ambiguity and instability. Ideological ambiguity and instability were also characteristic of the Japanese new sensationists whom Liu seemed to have so ardently admired. The new sensationist writing in Japan was a short-lived (1924-30), distinctly modernist movement that began around a magazine called Literary Age (BungeiJidai), with such participants as Kawabata Yasunari, Kataoka Teppei, and, most importantly, Yokomitsu Riichi. Among other things, they emphasized technical experimentation and capturing the subjective sensations of an act, instead of the act itself, in fresh new language and form. Liu's 1928 translation of Erotic Culture included Kataoka's "Erotic Culture," Yokomitsu's "Activities of the Seventh Floor" (Qilou de Yundong), and Iketani Shinzaburo's "Bridge" (Qiao). In his introduction to the collection, Liu writes that new sensationist writing is a symbolic form of writing, best suited to depicting the "color of the times" (shidai secai) in modern Japan. It exudes "the aura of importation" (pailai de qiwei), he says, and does not seem very "Japanese," but that this is precisely where its uniqueness lies. It does have a clear ideological content, according to Liu, which is that it exposes the corruption of Japan's capitalist society, while providing a prophetic vision of the coming proletarian society (Liu 1928a, 1-2). The recipe for</page><page sequence="10">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 943 new sensationism as laid out here by Liu is a combination of modernism (symbolic), socialism (anticapitalist) and exoticism (imported and not native). But what Liu says about Japanese new sensationism did not necessarily correspond to the perception of the concept by its practitioners. While Kataoka did soon become passionately engaged with the production of proletarian fiction, the soul of the group, Yokomitsu, remained firmly convinced of the autonomy of literature from ideological control and only much later turned to the right. The ambiguous ideological positioning of these Japanese modernists has often been seized upon by critics as marking the complicity of an apolitical, aestheticist stance with Japanese imperialism. This particular recipe of Japanese new sensationism is easily seen in Liu's own short stories, eight collected in Scene and two uncollected ones, "A Lady to Keep You Company" (his own English title) and "Below the Equator" (Chidao Xia). Many of these stories do not appear to have overt political references at all; rather, a profound ideological ambiguity enshrouds them. The so-called "depravity of capitalist culture" becomes the locus of allure and eroticization, thereby reducing the supposed socialist thrust to a kind of empty, perhaps fashionable, gesture. An illustration of this ambivalence can also be found in his other literary activities in the late 1920s. On the one hand he admired and translated the Marxist classic The Sociology of Art by the Soviet literary theoretician Vladimir M. Friche (originally published 1926; Liu's translation, 1930), while on the other he affected the writing style of the French aesthete writer Paul Morand, without noting the potential ideological contradiction between the two. In terms of the publication activities of his bookstores as well, he and his fellow modernists were chiefly interested in two kinds of literature: the "newly emergent literature" (xinxing wenxue) and the "avant-garde literature" (jianduan zvenxue) (Shi 1985, 184-90). The former refers to literature emerging from post- October Revolution Soviet Union, while the latter refers to literature with high aesthetic and often decadent thrust such as psychoanalytic fiction. The affinity in meaning and implication between the Chinese terms used-xinxing and jianduan- helps explain why these two kinds of literature were not considered contradictory as both foreground the sense of the new and the vanguard. So the Marxian notion of the political vanguard appears to have been wedded harmoniously with avant-garde aesthetic radicalism. It was therefore considered possible for the Chinese modernists to be anticapitalist and yet write in a modernist form where "technique is of foremost importance," as one critic said of Liu Na'ou's style (Yi 1944, 233). Despite Liu's critique of city culture as an immoral capitalist product, he is at the same time profoundly fascinated by it. The exotic setting of the partially colonized city of Shanghai afforded an occasion for the author to exercise techniques that mimic the smells, sounds, and speed of the city. Liu clearly takes great pleasure in describing city scenes, eroticizing them as the objects of his gaze. In almost every one of Liu's stories extended passages in metaphoric language depict aspects of city life and its material culture. Even the moral degradation of the city itself becomes seductive in such linguistic feasts. The city may be anthropomorphized into a horrifying monster-it "swallows up" people; its elevators and buildings "vomit" people out into the street8 -but the thrill the author connotes in describing such horror as a new mode of urban experience goes against his critical intent. The urban setting in the first story in Scene, "Games" (Youxi), allows the writer to experiment with unprecedented ways of capturing new sensations (hence their 8These two anthropomorphic images were used frequently by Liu Na'ou and later by Mu Shiying and others who imitated his style.</page><page sequence="11">944 SHU-MEI SHIH namesake, xinganjue). Without the nightclubs of Shanghai, there could not have been a description such as this: Everything in this "Tango Palace" is in melodious motion-male and female bodies, multicolored lights, shining wine goblets, red, green liquid and slender fingers, garnet lips, burning eyes. In the center is a smooth and shiny floor reflecting tables and chairs around it and the scene of people mixed together, making one feel as if one had entered a magic palace, where one's mind and spirit are both under the spell of magical powers. Amidst all this the most delicate and nimble are the movements of those waiters clad in white. Vivaciously, like butterflies among flowers, they fly from here to there, then from there to another place, without a trace of rudeness. The air is heavy with a mixture of alcohol, sweat and oil, encouraging all to indulge in the high level excitement. There is a middle-aged man laughing heartily with his teeth showing, a young lady speaking endearingly while her arms make charming, affected gestures. Over there, the one with his hands supporting his chin, staring at a bottle of beer on the table in front of him and always silent, is a lone man. Finding the couple sitting at a table by the window in this merry crowd is not so easy. -------Ha, ha, ha, ha. -------What's so funny? -------You look so funny, look, your eyes are filled with tears! Suddenly the air begins to stir and a blast of music vigilantly cries out. The musician in the middle of the band holds a saxophone, the demon of jazz, and blows wildly at the people. Then the gong, the drums, the organ and the strings start to howl madly. This is like a memory of African blacks, the sacrifice before the hunt, the pumping of blood in the veins, the discovery of primitive sexuality, the gong, drum, organ, strings, boom boom boom. (Liu 1930a, 3-6) The narrative angle moves like a film camera, capturing a large scene in a third- person, objective tone, then zooming in on a couple sitting by the window and pausing with them for a short while before moving onto the jazz band. Along the way, the nightclub affords the author the opportunity to describe the sights, sounds, colors, tastes, smells, and tempo of the place, in a technique that may be called "synaesthetic listing," in which a string of sense-crossing images follow one after another.9 This is a classic new sensationist technique later profusely utilized by many writers who wrote about the city, having its source not only in the Japanese new sensationists, but also in the "grandfather" of both Japanese and Chinese new sensationists: Paul Morand. In his article on Morand (translated by Liu), Benjamin Cremieux lists the repertoire of Morand's favorite techniques, many of which are dutifully employed by our Chinese Morand: the flash method of films, ellipsis, listing, roundabout description, irony, and so on (Liu 1928b, 147-60). But what is also notable in the above passage is that the urbanism of the scene is not presented without racial stereotyping: jazz is the music of African blacks and an expression of their "primitive sexuality."'10 Such 90n synaesthesia in new sensationist writing, also see Yan 1989, 125-74. "0Here it is informative to consider Franz Fanon's discussion of colonial sexual psychology where he notes that black men are made to represent primitive sexual instincts in the colonialist thinking as a way to vilify the black men as less than human (Fanon 1952, chap. 6). Also note the mistaken attribution of jazz to Africans rather than to the African diaspora in the United States.</page><page sequence="12">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 945 stereotyping will appear time and again in Liu's other stories, and I will come back to this point later. In the above passage, the tempo of the city as embodied in the constant darting of the narrative angle is a quick-time staccato, mimicking the wild trembling movements of the bodies dancing to the fast rhythms of the music. The speed of the city is also captured through flashing images. The male protagonist Buqing, the man who has tears in his eyes in the passage above, suddenly sees a tiger leaping, only to realize that it is a fur stole draped over a woman's shoulders. His perception is the camera capturing a sudden image as an illusion and later focusing it into a clear picture. Indirect descriptions abound: "Waves rose on the snow-white sheets" describes lovemaking; "he found by his lips a row of teeth not his own," describes a kiss (Liu 1930a, 14). The rhetoric has a persistent cinematic quality, using suggestive euphemisms coupled with imagistic, visual details. The lights of the city are as pale as "the faces of tuberculosis-stricken patients"; and as noted earlier, the metropolis is a "hungry monster" that engulfs people (Liu 1930a, 7, 14). Because of the hubbub and moral corruption of the city, Buqing becomes an alienated, disillusioned individual, the classic protagonist of modernist literature. Whereas human alienation was seen to be brought on by the overdevelopment of dehumanizing technology in Western modernism, Buqing's alienation in Shanghai may be said to be caused by his inability to come up to "speed," so to speak, with the urbanized city. He loves his urban girlfriend, appropriately named Yiguang (moving light), but she leaves him for a richer Chinese man with a Charlie Chaplin- like moustache who will provide her a Hollywood-style romance and a racy red sports car complete with two "black-faced chauffeurs." When as a parting gift she voluntarily offers Buqing her virginity, his outdated patriarchal moral sensibilities disallow him from experiencing any pleasure in the act. He only feels sorry for her future husband who has lost his right to her virginity. After finally parting with her, the city becomes a spiritual "desert" in Buqing's eyes, a degenerate place of abandon and immorality. He embodies the residual values of chastity, morality, and faithfulness, and thereby is all the more hopelessly alienated. With its anthropomorphic power, the city plays colossal jokes on him (he calls this "urban humor") and eventually swallows him up. He is a modern man lost in the city whose speed he cannot keep up with, dragging his traditional sense of propriety (including his male chauvinism), and trudging toward his inevitable doom. This variance between the speed of the city and the character's slowness indicates on the one hand how the urban is experienced in mainly temporal terms," and how the unevenness of the temporal experience implies the semicolonial subtext of urban modernity on the other. The semicolonial subtext is especially visible when we note the stereotypical and hierarchical representation of race, as in the passage quoted above referring to the black-faced chauffeurs. In "Etiquette and Hygiene" (/iyi he weisheng), the narrator records the male protagonist Qiming's visual experience of race as he travels from the bund to the Chinese city: The streets around the Huangpu bund before rush hour seemed to be occupied by Western women shopping. Their high heels stepped on tender sunlight, emitting light quick sounds on the wooden pavement. A blonde walked out from a flower shop holding an armful of tulips. A car arrived in a hurry and parked on the side of "1For a detailed analysis of the urban temporal experience in modern Chinese literature, see Zhang 1996.</page><page sequence="13">946 SHU-MEI SHIH the street, spitting out a woman in a light coat with the scent of green grass and her little daughter. A big Indian guy raised his short baton, so Qiming crossed the track following the vehicles, and entered a large drugstore. His nose immediately detected a meal of fancy fragrant dishes. -----How can I help you, sir? A Slavic woman asked, raising a face with only lips and eyes. -----Sana . .. Do you have the German make? -----Sana? Sana? . . . Of course, you mean ... She replaced the rest of the sentence with a smile and, after throwing him a knowing glance, went into the back of the store. ...... Slavic women are not bad either. Their primitive flavor like barbecued lamb from the Caucasus is worth tasting. Since their race has only relatively recently received the baptism of technology, they at least have less technological coldness than other nationalities. After having left their country, haven't they built an oasis along Avenue Joffre to humidify this desert-like Shanghai? Only a distance of two or three blocks and the scenery changed as if having crossed a huge ocean. The colorful store signs protruding from the shops made the area above the head a danger zone. From inside stores never having received the grace of sunlight spewed a cold ghastly stench. The mixture of oil, sweat, and dust pierced directly through the nose and into the lungs. Health had fled to a remote place. Even the cu cii sound of a hooker soliciting customers had the pungent odor of ammonia from the alley. A boiling teahouse opened its gigantic tiger mouth and sucked in the prostitutes and all other conspiracies, business plots, and machinations. (Liu 1930a, 111-14) Reading the different women described in this passage from the perspective of racial economy, the white women are the high-class consumers in the most trendy area of the city, the Slavic clerk is the capitalist mediator between commodity (prostituted bodies) and consumer through her sale of aphrodisiacs, the Russian prostitutes are the providers of exotic sexuality, and the Chinese prostitutes are the least expensive commodities, lowest in the hierarchy. The narrative focalizer of this passage, Qiming, is an elite lawyer who, known in the city as one who worked for women's rights, was ironically on his way to visit a Chinese prostitute. Along the way, he records what to him was just the common visual reality where racial hierarchy is assumed, not interrogated, and further consolidated through his own participation. His perception of the Chinese quarter in the last paragraph quoted above as laden with associations of filth and illegality would also easily pass as that of a racist Shanghailander. Furthermore, the hierarchically constituted racial structure of the city also mimics its stratified spatial structure. The lawyer moves from the bund to the Chinese city, from affluence to squalor, from the smell of "green grass" to "ammonia," marking the spatial disjunctures between modernity and underdevelopment the very condition of possibility for the semicolonial city. If Shanghai was a metropolis, the passage implicitly makes clear, it was a distinct Third World metropolis created by a semicoloniality that sanctions extremely uneven development. Just as it was a necessary ingredient for Japanese new sensationist writing, so too would the Chinese brand of new sensationism that Liu created be full of the "aura of importation" or exoticism which the semicolonial city of Shanghai abundantly provided. The specific historical conditions of Shanghai ironically rendered it the perfect site for the creation of this modernist, new sensationist writing. Chinese writers</page><page sequence="14">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 947 did not have to travel far to find materials to write in such a mode; even foreign writers could easily write about Shanghai as the perfect object of modernist representation-Yokomitsu's novel Shanghai (Shanhai, serialized 1928-31) being an example. This immigrants' city, in which there were very few "native" residents, did not discriminate against Liu Na'ou or prevent him from creating a new school of modern Chinese writing. The ambiguity surrounding his national and cultural identity merely dissipated into a sea of ambiguities that comprised the everyday existence of the urban man living in a fragmented city. His characters' alienation from the city results both from its fast-paced modernity as well as their inability to identify with the large Chinese populace whom they too denigrate. In the concessions, the intellectual protagonist in "Games" feels alienated; in the Chinese city, the lawyer from "Etiquette and Hygiene" willfully alienates himself from the Chinese throng to assert his superiority and his purchasing power. If we may call this a "denationalized," "rootless," "bourgeois cosmopolitanism" after Joseph Levenson, it is certainly not to criticize its practitioners as too simplistic, too detached from China, or acting like "imperialist-puppets" as Levenson does (Levenson 1971, 30-38). This cosmopolitanism is instead the very consequence of the semicolonial cultural condition which discourages attempts to forge a singular, stable cultural identity or solid ideological position beyond the dictates of nationalism. The City and the Modern Girl The male protagonist in "Games" observes a curious osmosis between the city and the modern girl, who is also a "product of modernity" ( jindai de canwu). She has round, thick lips, protruding breasts, a body soft and smooth like an eel, dangling jade earrings (references to her sexuality and seductiveness), a "rational" forehead, short hair, and a Greek nose (references to her Western appearance). She seeks pleasure, speed (she loves the 1928 Viper sports car), and money; she is attractive, precocious, but most importantly, unfaithful. With this story, Liu Na'ou creates a prototype of the modern Shanghai femme fatale who will populate many stories written in this era. Lodged in her are the characteristics of the urban culture of the semicolonial city and its seductions of speed, commodity culture, exoticism, and eroticism. Hence the emotions she stimulates in the male protagonist-helpless infatuation and hopeless betrayal-replicate the attraction and alienation he feels towards the city. The origin of this modern girl can be traced partly to Franco-Japanese sources. A short genealogy here is useful to show how Liu adopts and yet subverts the figure in terms of the cross-cultural politics of gender and race. The images of exotic women in Paul Morand's Fancy Goods (Tendres stocks, 1921) and Open All Night (Ouvert la nuit, 1922), two collections of stories influential both with Japanese and Chinese new sensationists, can be said to have descended from an exotic tradition in French literature traceable to Gustave Flaubert. In one of Flaubert's famous travel notes, he depicts an encounter with an Egyptian dancer, Kuchuk Hanem, who becomes the embodiment of the "Oriental": carnality and animality. Edward Said has shown how this figure of the Oriental woman provided an occasion for Flaubert to muse upon his own thoughts: she is passive, silent, gazed at, studied, and represented. Said therefore sees this as an example of Orientalism, a form of cultural domination exercised by Westerners which relegates the Orient to the status of the subhuman Other (Said 1979, 184-90). More blatant are the novels of Pierre Loti which reproduce this classic</page><page sequence="15">948 SHU-MEI SHIH Orientalist exoticism. In his autobiographical novel Madame Chrysantheme (1888) set in Japan and later translated into Chinese by Xu Xiacun (b. 1907), the Japanese woman depicted is said to be his "inanimate exotic object," strange and therefore attractive, mysterious, and inaccessible (Lerner 1974, 69-72). The lineage is then taken up by Paul Morand, many of whose stories have exotic, foreign women as protagonists. These women are wild, undisciplined, sentimental, and, of course, carefully studied by the male narrators as objects of erotic reveries. When this figure traveled to Japan, instead of the Occident's Oriental woman, she became the Orient's Occidental woman. The "modern girl" or "modan gdru" (moga for short), as she was called in one of the variations in Japan, had Westernized, if not Eurasian, looks, like Tanizaki Jun'ichiro's Naomi in his novel A Fool's Love (Chijin no ai, 1925), wore bobbed hair, sheer stockings, high heels, and often a brightly colored one-piece dress in the fashion of American film idols such as Clara Bow, Pola Negri, Mary Pickford, and Gloria Swanson (Sato 1993, 363-81). She was a "glittering, decadent, middle-class consumer who, through her clothing, smoking and drinking, flaunts tradition in the urban playgrounds of the late 1920s" (Silverberg 1991, 239). She travelled to China on her own sometimes, and appeared as the Japanese modern girl in Xu Xiacun's story with the English title "Modern Girl" (1929). The first mention of a Chinese "modern girl" (in her English appellation) appeared in a story collected in Concert Ditties (Yinyuehui Xiaoqu, 1927) by the Japan-educated May Fourth writer Tao Jingsun (1897-1952). When her image traveled to China through both American films and Japanese literature, she also took on the characteristics of a typical Chinese flapper-that product of the Jazz Age. According to a news item in the North China Herald in January 1928, she is defined as a young woman "usually dressed in semi-foreign style with bobbed hair ... short skirt.... and powdered face. She attends movies regularly and expects to be courted in screen lover fashion.... [She leads] a wholesome outdoor life and thrive[sJ on it." The newspaper then announces: "The Chinese flapper has come to stay" (Sergeant 1991, 271). In the web of signs in which she is produced within Liu Na'ou's fiction, however, the modern girl becomes a reciprocal metaphor of the city. The city is eroticized as the girl is eroticized; the girl is gazed at as the city is observed. Erotic intimacy and ineluctable separation-the latter could be said to enhance the former if we assume that desire operates through lack-characterize the male protagonist's relationship with the city and the modern girl. In a scene after the modern girl dumps the protagonist in "Games," an explicit connection is made between the modern girl and the city in their shared betrayal of the protagonist: She was gone, gone on a path he did not know. He followed the crowd rolling out of the station. Walking, he thought to himself.... What is this? ... Is this a joke played on me by the city? Ha, ha, .... A spasm of bitter laughter rolled from his stomach. Feet, feet, feet, feet on the pavement ..... In a moment, he was in the midst of a crowd, and the city, like a hungry ghost, swallowed him up. (Liu 1930a, 17) The speed of the city is paralleled by the speed with which the modern girl changes boyfriends and by the modern girl's love of speedy sports cars: transitory scenes and transitory romances, a city of fast cars and brief encounters. The modern girl in "Two Men Out of Tune with Time" (Liang ge Shijian de Buganzhengzhe) seduces several men around her, and then promptly and skillfully jilts all of them. She appears at a horse race like a puff of wind, bearing the fragrance of "Cyclamen" perfume:</page><page sequence="16">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 949 When H turned his head he saw the image of a sportive, modern girl. Under transparent, glossy French silk were elastic muscles trembling as if engaged in a slight exercise. When his eyes focused, he saw the small cherry break open and a smile protruding from the green lake. He felt that he could not remove his eyes from the pair of white knees slightly covered by the opera bag and peering out through the grey-black stockings. (Liu 1930a, 93) As luck would have it, the protagonist "H" wins a large sum at racetrack, is soon approached by the modern girl who unabashedly offers him a date, and goes with her to an American cafe. From the racetrack to the caf6 and then while promenading on busy commercial streets, urban lures such as a "Fontegnac 1929" automobile attract his attention, and he prides himself for being in tune with the urban tempo. But soon after, they run into a dapper young man named "T," who says that he has a date with this modern girl. The two men, now rivals, go to a dance hall together with her at her suggestion. After "T" and the girl dance to the blues (bolusi), "H" gets to dance a waltz (hua'erzi) with her, during which she abruptly tells him that his time is up. She lets fly the following remark at "H" who is still in shock: --- Ah, you are just a child. Who told you to be so clumsy and slow with your hands and feet? What with eating ice cream and taking a walk, what a bunch of nonsense! Don't you know that love-making should be done in a car amidst the wind? There is green shade outside the city [to park the car underl. I have never spent more than three hours with one gentleman. This was already an exception! (Liu 1930a, 104) She soon leaves both of them for another date, and upon leaving recommends to them that they pick up the taxi dancers instead. Although "H" believed himself to be in tune with the urban tempo, he abruptly discovers that he is lagging far behind the pace of the modern girl. In "Landscape" (Fengjinig), a chance encounter between a city man and the modern girl leads to a sexual frenzy in which the girl takes the initiative. The girl "smells of Brazilian coffee"; has "boyish short hair," "firm muscles," and a "rational, straight nose"; wears a "European-style short dress"; and speaks in a metallic voice. When they first meet on the train, described as "sitting on speed," the male protagonist, Ranqing, barely begins to muse upon the beauty of the female passenger sitting opposite him before she stares back at him and aggressively eroticizes him with her own "oppressive gaze." She then takes the lead by telling him that he has a "cute male face." Shocked by her directness, he gingerly begins to converse with her. At her suggestion they get off at a station and check into a hotel. But she is not to be constrained by the hotel room, and runs out into a field, stripping her clothes off as she goes. The "green grass" becomes their "bedsheets." In the end, however, she belongs to someone else or to no one in particular, so his desire for her can never be in the traditional form of "possessing" her sexuality. Similarly, when the male protagonist in "Below the Equator" takes his wife to a tropical island to separate her from her numerous male admirers in the city, he finds that even there she is unfaithful to him. His fantasy to maintain patriarchal authority, to be able to "order her to laugh, to cry, and even to beat her when necessary," ultimately to possess her fully, simply eludes him. Departing from the genealogy of exotic women from which she came, the modern girl in Liu Na'ou's fiction is no longer the passive object of erotic gaze, but the one who returns the gaze. Also contrary to the ways in which the representations of the</page><page sequence="17">950 SHU-MEI SHIH modern girl in Japanese intellectual discourse are made to displace the actual militancy of modern Japanese women (Silverberg 1991, 239-5 5), the particular "modernity"- or shall we say, "semicolonial modernity"-possessed by Liu's modern girl affords her a surprising degree of autonomy and agency. It is patriarchal sexual morality in the form of the ideology of female chastity ("Games"), marriage as convenient sexual contract ("Etiquette and Hygiene"), and the male possession of women ("Below the Equator") that are ironically treated and subtly criticized throughout these stories, not the transgressive behavior of the modern girl. The main female character in "Flow," for instance, a "modern, masculine woman" ( jindai de nanxinghua le de nuzi), is an example of a modern girl who transgresses the boundaries of gender and class, and who fights the imperialists through her involvement in the labor movement. Furthermore, in the ironically entitled "The Passionate Man" (Reqing zhi gu) and in "Etiquette and Hygiene," a modern girl who defies Orientalism appears. In the first story, a Frenchman named Pierre comes to the Orient in search of exotica. A self- styled Pierre Loti, as he himself puts it, he dreams of meeting his own Madame Chrysanthemum as in Loti's novel by the same name. One day at a flower shop amid the fragrance of chrysanthemums and marigolds, he discovers his "Chrysanthemum," his "mermaid," a "spring goddess from the flower garden." She promptly becomes the repository of Oriental exotica for him: ... He could not believe that such a charming lovely Chrysanthemum could be so close at hand. He thought about her and felt that every point on her body from head to toe was lovely. Those black eyes seemed to hide in their depths the passion of the Orient, those two pearl-colored ears were the shells in the ocean from which Venus was born. The subtle movements around her waist carried with them a mystery that those Near Eastern women in Hugo's poetry do not have. Slender delicate eyebrows, Ah! Those small feet that cannot bear a squeeze! Compared to the animal-like Western European women, how fragile and sweet she is! (Liu 1930a, 76) He goes about colonizing her materially, so to speak, bringing her chocolates from Marseilles, buying her things, and taking her out to theaters and ball games. The shroud of mystery surrounding her background, like her "mysterious black eyes," only enhances her seductiveness. However, in what to him is an unbelievable anticlimax, at the crucial moment when he, mumbling "Ma cherie" and entirely engrossed, bears upon her "fragile body" that seems to crush beneath his weight, she suddenly says, "Will you give me five hundred yuan?" She plummets from goddess to prostitute in his eyes, his exoticist imagination completely shattered, he turns away in disgust. Far from being the passive receptacle for his fantasies, she rebukes him in a letter that he receives the next morning: Do you think I am too materialistic [for having asked you for moneyl? But when all abstract things such as justice and morality can be bought with money in this economic age, why do you demand that I not exchange my chastity for some urgently needed cash? . . . Are you saying that I should not have requested it at that moment? I have never been a woman with constraints. I speak when I want to, and I cannot comprehend those people who cannot express their thoughts as they come to them. I think it is good to be so materielle as myself. Whenever you speak, you write poetry like a poet. But the kind of poetry you demand is nowhere to be found in this age. The content of the poem has changed.</page><page sequence="18">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 951 Even if there is poetry in front of your eyes, I am afraid you won't see it. That's all. You may go back to dream those old dreams of your past. (Liu 1930a, 86) Demanding money from him is, from her point of view, in keeping with his own method of seducing her through material gifts. She therefore exposes the snobbishness of his exoticism: it is created purely out of his imagination and will, and it refuses to allow for the existence of anything that runs counter to his carefully constructed illusion. Within this manufactured Orientalist dream or poetic fantasy, he can shower her with material goods, but she may not request them. Her demand for money therefore unsettles this unequal colonial relationship where the colonizer is invariably constructed to be the giver or benefactor, and the colonized the passive recipient of colonial gift. With her demand, she consciously shatters Pierre's exotic fantasy and sabotages his Orientalism. Most significantly, this sabotage occurs through a strategic self-commodification. Her unabashed materiality is the marker of her anti-Orientalist agency; her materiality is the gaze back at the Orientalist imagination by refusing to conform to the latter's rules. "Etiquette and Hygiene," from which the passage about Qiming the lawyer travelling from the bund to the Chinese quarters is taken earlier, further dramatizes a subversion of Orientalism, but in this story, a Frenchman's Orientalist fantasy is thwarted at the same time Qiming's patriarchal authority is repudiated. Using the exact same words used by Pierre in "The Passionate Man" to describe his Oriental beauty, the Frenchman Pouillet notes that Keqiong, Qiming's wife and the object of his desire, is not animalistic like Western women, her black eyes "hiding the secret of the East," and her ears "as lovely as the seashells brought from the depth of the ocean." He calls his infatuation with Keqiong part of his "intoxication with the East" (dongfang zui), which includes a passion for Chinese antiques and art objects. An erstwhile Beijing-based diplomat who became a seller of Chinese antiques to Westerners in Shanghai, Pouillet decides to pursue his Orientalist dream by "purchasing" Keqiong from her husband Qiming. He offers Qiming his antique shop and all its contents in exchange for a couple of years of "seductive bliss" (yanfu). As a patriarchal and unfaithful husband, Qiming ironically sees Pouillet's Orientalism as an expression of true love, although he does not accept or reject Pouillet's offer but rushes home. There he finds that Keqiong has disappeared; a note informs him that she has left with her new lover whom she calls her "Pekinese." Keqiong thereby refuses to play either the role of an erotic object d'art for Pouillet, or the faithful wife for a husband who frequents prostitutes, but an active agent in pursuit of her own pleasure. With her husband she leaves her mute sister because, as she explains in the note, what her husband needs and wants is not so much a woman as a female body. She further explains that she is leaving her sister with him to prevent his contracting sexual diseases from visiting prostitutes. Finally, she taunts him by saying, "the easy to get are not always the most hygienic"-hence the ironic title, "Etiquette and Hygiene." The modern girl who gazes back and resists both Western Orientalism and Chinese patriarchy is able to do so precisely because of an ambivalent identity that is no longer "essentially" Chinese but has attributes of both the Hollywood actress and the Westernized moga from Japan. She communicates signs of Western material culture through her paraphernalia (clothing, handbag, cosmetics), her sexual promiscuity, her mannish Western looks (high nose, slender body, short hair, often with muscular arms and legs), and her unrestrained behavior. She is in this sense a dissimulation of the images of Hollywood actresses and the moga, which allows her</page><page sequence="19">952 SHU-MEI SHIH to exude an exotic imported air. But in the intimate co-figuration of her and the city of Shanghai, we see how her excessive materiality simultaneously implies the semicolonial condition. Both a discursively constructed (borrowed, dissimulated) and materially contextualized figure (who roams the urban spaces of the semicolonial city) then, she unsettles the bifurcation of the discursive and the material in the enlightenment discourse that sought to displace the semicolonial reality with a project of cosmopolitan, cultural modernity. By so doing, she disrupts the intellectual conception of modernity as the property of the metropolitan West that can be learned only belatedly by the Chinese, and instead pushes it into an impure realm where the "contamination" from semicolonial culture cannot be entirely prevented. She is therefore the object on which, to borrow Leo Lee's phrases from a slightly different context, an "urban imagination of Chinese modernity" is focused and where the "modernity of the everyday life" is envisioned and materialized (Lee 1996, 23). Liu Na'ou's cosmopolitanism then departs from that of the May Fourth intellectuals in its incorporation of semicolonial urbanity. This explains why the kind of modernity Liu communicated appeared decadent and corrupt to nationalist intellectuals associated with either the League of the Leftwing Writers or the Guomindang. His vision of modernity is not merely a projection of an ideal based on a discursive emulation of the metropolitan West, but also a willing engagement with the materiality of the West in its "corrupted" form of semicolonial culture. Conclusion: Desire and Semicolonial Modernity In the absence of a securely positioned nationalist imaginary as in Franz Fanon's Antilles or nineteenth-century Indian nationalist discourse as presented by Partha Chatterjee, the Westernized modern girl in Liu Na'ou's work comes to represent not the object of repudiation but the object of desire. Departing from the representation of Westernized women in the nationalist imaginary, the modern girl's sexual promiscuity, rather than condemned on patriarchal moral grounds, becomes the mark of her free will to pursue her own desires. Her materiality, rather than condemned as vulgar and corrupt, becomes the sign of her ability to adapt to the modern world; it is a metonymic extension of the inescapable materiality of modernity. Rather than posing a threat of double emasculation to the native male, she embodies the speed of modernity that demands pursuit. Instead of being a threatening double to the male intellectual, she subverts tradition in a way that the male intellectual himself might have liked to do. In this particular sense, she plays the mediating role between Western material culture and the male intellectual, as she stands at the vanguard in the pursuit of urban modernity. This icon of modernity threatens Liu's male characters' sense of masculinity, but since that masculinity is not undergirded by nationalism, the usual union between nationalism and patriarchy is sundered. This absence of nationalism in the patriarchal imagination may be due to Liu's own ambivalent national identity, but it reveals, in large measure, the agenda of a cosmopolitan project whose categories are conceived in terms other than the nation. When nationalism no longer operates to subsume and subjugate issues regarding women, a radical subversion of patriarchy becomes securable, and a more sustained gendered inquiry into male-female relationships becomes feasible. Indeed, as history tells us, nationalism in Third World nations has time and again served as effective ammunition for patriarchy to assert its control over women in order to displace frustration with</page><page sequence="20">GENDER, RACE, AND SEMICOLONIALISM 953 threats of colonial, and, more recently, neocolonial forces. The ironic conclusion we may derive from Liu Na'ou's work is that, in modern China, denationalized cosmopolitanism may be the only position from which women's emancipation from patriarchal control can be expressed without too many strings attached. In the modern girl's refusal to conform to the fantasies of Western Orientalism as represented by the characters of Pierre and Pouillet, we see that her modernity does not co-opt Western categories of gender relegated to "Oriental" women, nor does she readily accept all Western cultural values. Her rebellion is therefore two-pronged, against both the patriarchal and the Orientalist imaginaries, which raises the provocative question of whether there are structural similarities between Third World patriarchy and Orientalism in their shared desire to subjugate native women as a depository of male fantasy. When Pouillet offered to exchange his antique shop for the "ownership" of Keqiong in "Etiquette and Hygiene," Qiming's understanding of that offer as arising from love leads one to believe that the Orientalist and the patriarchal indeed can be complicit: if she had not resisted, Keqiong could have been bartered, transacted, and trafficked, to help maintain both communities of men and their homogeneous interests. The modern girl's refusal to play by both sets of rules distinguishes her from the myriad representations of modern women since the May Fourth era. In the trajectory of changing representation of women in modern Chinese literature, the modern girl's antecedent may be traced back to the "new woman" (xin nixing) of May Fourth writing, where the new woman's emancipatory behavior is projected by a generation of male writers who themselves could not overcome existing feudal structures such as arranged marriages. The new woman was the courageous figure who put into practice the agenda of "total westernization" (quanpan xihua) and antitraditionalism (for example, Hu Shi's propagation of Ibsen's Nora, Lu Xun's Zijun, and Mao Dun's many heroines); hence her failure to achieve complete liberation embodied the eventual despair of May Fourth male writers at the tenacity of feudal structures and the difficulty of completing the cultural enlightenment project (Chan 1993, 13-32). The new woman was predominantly a trope for the projection of male desire, the site where male subjectivity negotiated its changing relationship with the May Fourth dyad of tradition and modernity. It is therefore not surprising that the representation of the new woman was more or less subjugated by male narrative voices, and antifeminist sentiments were often unabashedly articulated (Shih 1994, 108-27). The modern girl may also be interpreted in terms of the question of male subjectivity. In her transgressiveness on the planes of gender, race, culture, and national identity, we may read the projection of a cosmopolitan male subjectivity of an ideal double upon whom he lavishes desire and adoration. Neither moaning over the difficulties of achieving cultural enlightenment, nor using women to criticize society, both of which are premised on a stable male identity and a sense of patriarchal right, Liu Na'ou's work rather presents a male subjectivity that questions its groundings in patriarchy, that does not assume a stable identity, and that opens the question of newly constructed gender roles in the urban context of semicolonial Shanghai. Instead of despair, then, here the modern girl's relative success in attaining autonomy may indicate a certain hopefulness in Liu's vision of modernity that captured the coexistence of the metropolitan and the colonial. Finally, in the persistent bifurcation of the West as a discursive and a material presence in modern Chinese intellectual discourse, the representation of the Westernized modern girl can also be interpreted as a discursive attempt to confront, negotiate, and incorporate the material. Because of her overpowering seductiveness, she becomes securely lodged as a prominent figure in the landscape of the male</page><page sequence="21">954 SHU-MEI SHIH protagonist's desire, and has ineluctably become constitutive of what he is as a man of desire. Within this realm of desire, the discursive and the material cannot be easily separated any longer as she transgresses their boundaries by embodying elements from both. As a figure of urban modernity, she further exemplifies how modernity as a discursive construct itself must confront the material conditions of semicoloniality, and how desire is inextricably intertwined with this semicolonial modernity. In the work of other Shanghai modernists such as Shi Zhicun and Mu Shiying, the make- up of this landscape of desire is uncovered in its ever greater complexity, encompassing the ambivalent experience of urban modernity in the semicolonial condition. The exploration of this landscape, however, would gradually become delegitimized with the increasing ascendancy of the Manichean politics of nationalism after the outburst of the Sino-Japanese war, eliminating the condition of possibility for the kind of semicolonial cultural politics we witness here.
