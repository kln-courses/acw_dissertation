Honeycutt - Sabine Begall Oliver Locker-Gru'tjen * Andreas Scharff Are naked and common mole-rats eusocial and if so, why? Received: 19 April 1999 / Received in revised form: 10 December 1999 / Accepted: 23 January 2000 Abstract Eusociality in mammals is defined in the pres- ent paper by the following criteria: reproductive altruism (which involves reproductive division of labor and coop- erative alloparental brood care), overlap of adult genera- tions, and permanent (lifelong) philopatry. We argue that additional criteria such as the existence of castes, colony size, reproductive skew, and social cohesion are not per- tinent to the definition of eusociality in mammals. Ac- cording to our definition of mammalian eusociality, sev- eral rodent species of the African family Bathyergidae can be considered eusocial, including the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), Damaraland mole-rat (Crypto- mys damarensis), and several additional, if not all, spe- cies in the genus Cryptomys. Furthermore, some species of social voles (like Microtus ochrogaster) may also ful- fill criteria of mammalian eusociality. Understanding the evolution of eusociality in mole-rats requires answers to two primary questions: (1) What are the preconditions for the development of their eusocial systems? (2) Why do offspring remain in the natal group rather than dis- persing and reproducing? Eusociality in mammals is by definition a special case of monogamy (more specifical- ly: monogyny one female breeding), involving pro- longed pair bonding for more than one breeding period. We argue that eusociality in mole-rats evolved from a monogamous mating system where cooperative brood care was already established. A tendency for group liv- ing is considered to be an ancestral (plesiomorph) trait among African bathyergid mole-rats, linking them to other hystricognath rodents.

Honeycutt Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences and Faculty of Genetics, Texas A&amp;M University, 210 Nagle Hall, College Station, TX 77843, USA some genera, such as Bathyergus, Georychus, and Helio- phobius, is assumed to be a derived trait that arose inde- pendently in different lineages of bathyergids, possibly as a consequence of selective constraints associated with the subterranean environment. In proximate terms, in eu- social mole-rats either puberty is assumed to be develop- mentally delayed so that under natural conditions most animals die before dispersal is triggered (e.g., in the case of Heterocephalus) or dispersal is induced only by an in- cidental encounter with an unfamiliar, yet adequate sexu- al partner (e.g., in the case of Cryptomys). Ultimately, a combination of strategies involving either dispersal and/or philopatry can be beneficial, especially in a high- ly unpredictable environment. If genetic relatedness among siblings is high (e.g., a coefficient of relatedness of 0.5 or more), then philopatry would not invoke an ap- preciable loss of fitness, especially if the cost of dispers- ing is higher than staying within the natal group. High genetic relatedness is more likely in a monogamous mat- ing system or a highly inbred population. In this paper, we argue that the preconditions for eusociality in bathy- ergid mole-rats were a monogamous mating system and high genetic relatedness among individuals. We argue against the aridity food-distribution hypothesis (AFDH) that suggests a causal relationship between cooperative foraging for patchily distributed resources and the origin of eusociality. The AFDH may explain group size dy- namics of social mole-rats as a function of the distribu- tion and availability of resources but it is inadequate to explain the formation of eusocial societies of mole-rats, especially with respect to providing preconditions con- ducive for the emergence of eusociality.

Although many specimens of mole-rats have been collected and many new species and subspecies were named in the late 1800s and early 1900s, a basic under- standing of mole-rat biology, especially with respect to ecological and behavioral characteristics, remained ob- scure. By the end of 1980, no more than 40 papers had been published on mole-rat biology, and it was not until the two seminal papers by Nevo (1979) and Jarvis (1981) that interest in mole-rats was stimulated. While Nevo's (1979) paper dealt with subterranean mammals in general, it did stimulate considerable research in the physiology, sensory biology, communication, temporal and spatial orientation, ecology, taxonomy, and phyloge- ny of fossorial rodents including mole-rats. Jarvis' (1981) paper was devoted to naked mole-rats, and their unusual social system was described for the first time. From 1981 to 1990, approximately 45 papers were pub- lished on various aspects of the morphology, physiology, ethology, ecology, and evolution of African mole-rats, and stimulated by this research and new information on fossorial rodents, two books were edited by Nevo and Reig (1990) and Sherman et al. (1991), the latter book being dedicated to the evolution and behavior of naked mole-rats and related bathyergids. Since the publication of these two books, about 130 papers have been pub- lished on African mole-rats, and one of the most fre- quently emphasized attributes of mole-rat biology has been their "eusocial" system. In fact, eusociality in mammals has been equated with the social system seen in the naked mole-rat Heterocephalus glaber and the Damaraland mole-rat, Cryptomys damarensis (Jarvis and Bennett 1993). What is eusociality? In the entomological literature, eusociality was defined by Batra (1966), Michener (1969), and Wilson (1971) as a social system with (1) reproductive division of labor (monopolization of breeding by a few individuals while the majority does not breed), (2) overlap between gener- ations (age classes, life stages), and (3) cooperative brood care (parental andlor alloparental care). The attributes of eusociality, as originally outlined in the classical definition, are similar to the concept of the co- operative monogamy described for some mammals (cf., Kleiman 1977; Carter and Getz 1993; Solomon and French 1997). Accordingly, Gadagkar (1994) and Sherman et al. (1995) proposed that "eusociality" should be viewed as synonymous with "cooperative breeding," thus repre- senting a continuum of fundamentally similar social sys- tems whose main differences lie in the distribution of lifetime reproductive success among group members, i.e., in the degree of reproductive skew (breeding asym- metry). However, defining eusociality by means of re- productive skew is problematic because different species may reveal reproductive skew but for different reasons, and that skew might be more ephemeral in some situa- tions than in others (Crespi and Yanega 1995; Crespi 1996; Wcislo 1997). Adopting the expanded usage of the term eusociality, as suggested by Gadagkar (1994) and Sherman et al. (1995), requires that other species of mammals (e.g., dwarf mongooses, wolves, African wild dogs) be considered eusocial. The classical definition of eusociality was developed and used prior to the identification of mammals as po- tentially eusocial. Thus some entomologists suggested that an additional criterion - permanent castes (individ- uals with distinct life histories) - should be added to the classical definition, thus narrowing the scope of the term eusociality (Michener 1974; Kukuk 1994; Crespi and Yanega 1995; Crespi 1996). With this additional at- tribute, the naked mole-rat would be excluded because there are no irreversible permanent castes. Although there is a basic distinction between breeders and non- breeders in naked mole-rats, we consider any discussion of reproductive and non-reproductive castes as repre- senting an overstatement. It is quite clear that non- breeding in mole-rats and other mammals that show re- productive altruism (or helping) has the potential to be transient. Rather than attempting to change definitions of eusociality, Wcislo (1997) has suggested that terms be used in a manner that enhance our ability to test hy- potheses pertaining to complex social systems. The im- portance of the definition is whether it is useful in high- lighting convergence in ecology and social characteris- tics. In the case of mole-rats, some authors distinguish be- tween "eusocial" and "social" (meaning cooperatively breeding) species on the basis of maximum colony size and "level of social organization" (e.g., Jarvis et al. 1994; Faulkes et al. 1997; Faulkes 1998; Wallace and Bennett 1998). For instance, Faulkes et al. (1997) made the following statement: "As a measure of sociality, we chose maximum group size, a parameter for which we have the most complete data set, although group sizes for (some species) are based on limited data from 3-6 colo- nies" (p. 1621) . . . "Maximum group size was chosen as our measure of sociality as it reflects constraints on dis- persal" (p. 1626). However, the choice of maximum group size as a measure of sociality is problematic. First, absolute colony size is not considered in the definition of eusociality, and is not an appropriate mea- sure for quantifying the degree of sociality (reproductive skew index, eusociality index) (cf., Keller and Reeve 1994; Keller and Perrin 1995). Sherman et al. (1995) noted that as group size increases, the probability de- creases that a particular individual will be able to fill any within-group breeding vacancy. However, if breeding possibilities are constrained by incest avoidance, none of the animals would reproduce within its family (regard-</page><page sequence="3">295 Table 1 Classification and nomenclature of social and mating systems encountered in fossorial and subterranean rodents Social system Mating system Characteristics (example) Solitary Diverse Burrow system is occupied by a single adult animal, mother cares for her offspring alone, young disperse after weaning (Spalax ehrenbergi). Colonial (gregarious) Diverse Basically solitary animals build their burrow systems in close vicinity to each other (Citellus citellus). Social Burrow system is occupied by at least two adult animals. Communal, Polygynous Typically, more than one female breeds in a colony simultaneously; ?cooperatively breeding (polygamous) nestmates may or may not cooperate (Spalacopus cyanus). Familial, Monogynous Typically, only one female breeds in a group. Dispersal of the offspring cooperatively breeding (monogamous) is delayed; as long as they live in the parental nest they do not reproduce; they help in foraging, extending, maintaining and defending the burrow system and looking after younger siblings (Microtus pinetorum - if not eusocial). Eusocial Monogynous Most of the offspring never disperse and are lifelong nonbreeding helpers (monogamous) (Cryptomys damarensis). less of whether the family consists of either 4 or 40 members) even if there was a breeding vacancy. Second, colony size (like population size) is affected by habitat quality (i.e., availability of resources) as demonstrated for naked mole-rats (Brett 1991) or voles (Solomon and Getz 1997, and citations therein) and it may fluctuate in time and space. Given this fluctuation, the comparability of data on colony size (both mean and maximum) is severely affected by sample size. Many years of intensive field work and investigation and/or re- visiting of many (n&gt;60) colonies were needed before a group with 300 naked mole-rats (H. glaber) (Brett 1991) or 41 Damaraland mole-rats (C. damarensis) (Jarvis and Bennett 1993) was found. Mean family sizes in these species are much lower. Furthermore, colony size reflects more than just con- straints on dispersal (contra Faulkes et al. 1997). Colony size is a product of at least three factors which may change in time and space: (1) rate of recruitment of new family members (determined by the number of breeding females and their fecundity); (2) duration of the period spent by offspring in the parental nest (determined by lifespan, developmental rate, and timing of dispersal), and (3) loss of family members due to dispersal and mor- tality. Colony size is a useful tool for comparing ecological and behavioral characteristics among different eusocial species (e.g., in insects that differ with respect to colony characteristics and ecology). Nevertheless, we consider group size as being uninformative in terms of either quantifying the degree of sociality (colonial, communal, or familial) or identifying a particular mating system (monogynous versus polygynous) in mammals (cf., Ta- ble 1). "Level of social organization" is a vague term and a parameter composed of several components, and there- fore, cannot be directly and unambiguously quantified. Comparative laboratory studies of "social cohesion," "dominance hierarchy," and so on in different species are problematic because different species behavior may vary in response to captive conditions. Rosenthal et al. (1992), Gabathuler et al. (1996), and Wallace and Bennett (1998) compared the (stability of) linear domi- nance between different "social" and "eusocial" Crypto- mys species, and argued that dominance is indicative of social complexity. There is, however, little reason to as- sume a relationship between dominance and degree of sociality. In a eusocial system, a clear dominance/subor- dinance relationship can be expected only between breeders and non-breeders and only when breeding in subordinates is behaviorally suppressed. However, if the "sterility" of all non-breeders is mediated by incest avoidance or pheromones (which means that none of the non-breeders has a chance to emancipate behaviorally and usurp the nest from within), an egalitarian society of non-breeders can be expected (cf., Burda 1999 for fur- ther discussion). Linearity of dominance is thus indica- tive of mechanisms associated with the maintenance of social structure but not of its degree of complexity. Recently, Burda (1999) suggested continued use of the terms "eusocial" and "cooperative breeding." In ad- dition, he suggested that for mammals, permanent phi- lopatry (as opposed to temporary philopatry) be used along with the classical attributes to define eusocial sys- tems. Duration of philopatry equates with the duration of reproductive altruism as indicated in Tablel. Which bathyergid mole-rats are eusocial? Although we present in Table 2 an overview of social or solitary habits among subterranean and fossorial rodents, in the following discussion we focus on the family Bathyergidae represented by five genera of subterranean mole-rats. These genera exhibit different social behavior. Three genera (Bathyergus, Georychus, and Helio- phobius) comprise animals of solitary habits and in terms of mating behavior are presumably promiscuous (yet nothing is known about mating systems in these sol- itary species). Mole-rats of the two other genera, Hetero-</page><page sequence="4">296 Table 2 Which fossorial and subterranean rodents are social? This survey shows the distribution of social and solitary lifestyles (sensu definitions in Table 1) among the genera of fossorial and subterra- nean rodents as retrieved from the current mammalogical literature and references quoted below. There is a continuum in degrees of adaptation and confinement to subterranean mode of life. Whereas bathyergids and spalacines are truly subterranean, other named ro- dents may also forage and disperse aboveground, yet this aspect of their ecology is largely unknown (cf. Nevo 1999). We follow the classification of rodents proposed by McKenna et al. (1998). Most of the social subterranean rodents belong to the suborder Hystrico- gnatha and to the subfamily Arvicolinae of the Muridae, though not all the subterranean hystricognaths and arvicolines are social. The African rodent family Bathyergidae includes five genera of subterranean mole-rats exhibiting different social behavior: three genera (Bathyergus, Georychus, and Heliophobius) comprise animals of solitary habits. Two genera, Heterocephalus (naked mole-rat) and Cryptomys are highly social, living in monogynous families whose structure can be denoted (in Heterocephalus glaber and at least some species of Cryptomys) as eusocial (see references and reasonings in the main text). Within subterranean octodontids, the genus Ctenomys compris- es species which lead a solitary existence as well as some which are social. In some species, there may also be sexual and regional differences in sociality, and both solitary and social lifestyles may be encountered (Reig et al. 1990). In general, the social organiza- tion of colonies in Ctenomys is poorly understood (Lacey et al. 1997) and it is virtually unknown in Pithanotomys (=Aconaemys) (Nowak 1991; Redford and Eisenberg 1992). The coruros, Spalac- opus, apparently live in extended polygynous (harem) colonies consisting of up to more than 32 members (Begall et al. 1999). Dispersal of the offspring is delayed and they help in foraging, de- fending the burrow system, and taking care of younger siblings (see also Table 3). Relatively little is known about social behavior in fossorial ec- himyid and arvicoline rodents. Although some are classified as so- cial, the evidence is mostly only anecdotal. In fact, the traits of co- operative monogamy as described for prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster and some other microtine voles (cf. Carter and Getz 1993; Getz and Carter 1996; Solomon and Getz 1997, and litera- ture cited therein) correspond very much to the attributes of euso- ciality (Solomon 1994; see also Table 3). Most fossorial sigmodontines (as well as Myospalax) are probably solitary, yet data on their life histories are very scarce or not avail- able. All rhizomyines and geomyids are solitary.

(BxC)] cephalus (naked mole-rat) and Cryptomys live in groups. Both field and laboratory data suggest that H. glaber and all species of Cryptomys that have been studied so far are monogynous with a clear tendency to monogamy. Mating of a single breeding female (monogyny) with one to three males (polyandry) and multimale parentage is rather common in H. glaber (Jarvis 1981; Faulkes et al. 1997; Lacey and Sherman 1997). The existence of two breeding females (polygyny) within a colony is not ex- cluded but is rather exceptional. In H. glaber, up to 11% of families may involve more than one breeding female (Sherman et al. 1992). The incidental occurrence of more than one breeding female in a family has been reported for the giant mole-rat, C. mechowi (Burda and Kawalika 1993). Because the frequency of dispersal and philopatry cannot be estimated in captive mole-rat colonies, it is difficult to distinguish between prolonged philopatry as- sociated with eusociality and ephemeral philopatry gen- erally associated with familial cooperative breeding. An objective means of assessing the persistence of philopatry and non-breeding by individual mole-rats is to conduct field studies designed to observe and quantify the length of time individuals stay within the familial group. Such information requires multiple-year mark-re- capture studies of all animals in a colony. One problem with such an approach are the time and labor required. A second problem relates to the invasiveness of the meth- od, which considerably disturbs animals, colonies, and burrow systems. Such disturbance can interfere with the normal structure and dynamics of a colony. Thus far, di- rect field evidence of eusociality is available only for H. glaber (Jarvis 1981; Brett 1991; Braude and Ciszek 1998) and C. damarensis (Jarvis and Bennett 1993; Jar- vis et al. 1994). An indirect method of estimating philopatry can be obtained from the relationship among colony size, repro- duction, and developmental biology as follows: P=S- R, where P=philopatry (turnover), S=colony size, and R=re- cruitment (number of breeding females times fecundity). There is indirect evidence (philopatry and turnover of families estimated on the basis of the group size in the field and reproductive parameters in the laboratory) that Zambian mole-rats, C. anselli (a recently described new species; cf., Burda et al. 1999) and C. mechowi, as well as all Cryptomys species studied to date should be con- sidered eusocial in the same way as either H. glaber or C. damarensis. Considering laboratory data on fecundity and field data on colony size, we can conclude that a na- ked mole-rat lives in the parental colony on average for 15 months, a Zambian mole-rat (C. anselli or C. mechowi) for 31 months (cf., Table 3). This conclusion is congru- ent with results from field studies. For instance, of the six families of H. glaber studied in the field for up to 4 years, only 1- 2% of the initial residents remained af- ter 3 years (Sherman et al. 1992). Apparently, the main mechanism of increasing and maintaining family size in H. glaber is through prolific breeding and colony regeneration, whereas stability is an essential ingredient for maintaining family size in Cryp- tomys. Although absolute life expectancy estimated for each genus in the field may be different, relative life ex- pectancy (measured by the overlap of generations) is comparable. An "average" mole-rat in both Heteroceph- alus and Cryptomys lives long enough to care for about six litters of siblings, with subsequent death or dispersal. In captivity, mole-rats live and probably breed for much longer. For example, captive H. glaber have lived in ex- cess of 21 years (Faulkes 1998), and observations of C. anselli in our laboratory have documented individuals living at least 17 years. One may conclude that despite smaller family sizes for C. anselli and C. mechowi, both Cryptomys taxa are as philopatric as H. glaber. The estimation of philopatry (cf., Table 3) in the prai- rie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) indicates that this spe- cies (and probably also some other microtines) should be considered eusocial almost in the same way as Hetero- cephalus or Cryptomys, as suggested earlier by Solomon (1994). On the other hand, the overlap of generations and the degree of philopatry in the coruro (Spalacopus cyanus), another species of social subterranean rodent, is</page><page sequence="6">298 apparently somewhat lower than in either social bathy- ergids or the prairie vole. Why are Hetrwepthals and Cryptems mole-rats eusocial? Proximate factors relating to the maintenance of the eu- social structure (pair bonding, tolerance toward weaned offspring, reproductive suppression or reproductive ab- stinence, suppression or delay or non-expression of dis- persal) have been reviewed in Honeycutt (1992) and Burda (1999) and will be only marginally addressed here. One hypothesis pertaining to preconditions for the or- igin of eusociality in mole-rats was proposed by Richard Alexander (Alexander 1991; Alexander et al. 1991). This hypothesis (termed the predator, safety hypothesis) em- phasized the safety of the subterranean niche as a factor promoting a tendency to become eusocial. However, the pattern of convergence among subterranean mammals does not support the idea (cf., also Jarvis et al. 1994). The underground niche seems to lead to territoriality and competition, and indeed the solitary way of life is typical for subterranean mammals (Nevo 1979, 1995). Two ad- ditional hypotheses (the aridity food distribution hypoth- esis [AFDH] and the hypothesis of phylogenetic con- straints) have been put forward as explanations for the origin and adaptive significance of eusociality in mole- rats. To evaluate these hypotheses, one must first consid- er how they relate to individual components of eusociali- ty. This requires an examination of three questions per- taining to eusocial systems: (1) Why are Heterocephalus and Cryptomys monoga- mous (monogynous)? (2) Why are the offspring reproductively altruistic? (3) Why do most offspring not disperse? We will attempt to address each of these questions in the following paragraphs. Why are Heterocephalus and Cryptomys monogamous? One explanation for monogamy in Heterocephalus and Cryptomys may be a tendency toward increased social tolerance and aggregation. Nevo et al. (1992) and Ganem and Nevo (1996) found that Spalax in desert habitats ex- hibits diminished aggression, and suggested that this pacifistic behavior has been adaptively selected for sur- vival in harsh desert conditions. This strategy may mini- mize overheating, water and energy expenditure, and can be considered a prerequisite for social evolution. Never- theless, Burda (1998a, 1998b) has argued that this find- ing is not pertinent to the evolution of eusociality in bathyergids (but see Ganem 1998). Groups of H. glaber and Cryptomys arise through retention and cohesion of family members and not through aggregation of unfamil- iar individuals as in pacifistic Spalax populations. In fact, (eu)social bathyergid mole-rats are xenophobic and aggressive against unfamiliar conspecifics. In general (cf., also Kleiman 1977), social tolerance of a mate beyond the mating period may be selected for in subterranean rodents when (1) assistance of the part- ner is needed because the female cannot competently rear her young alone and/or (2) finding an adequate part- ner is risky. The question of risky breeding dispersal and finding a partner will be discussed below in connection with general problems of dispersal. Based on the analysis of reproductive, growth, and de- velopmental parameters in Zambian Cryptomys (Burda 1989a, 1990; Burda and Kawalika, 1993), we suggested that cooperative breeding in some mole-rats is necessary primarily because the female mole-rat may be not able to rear her offspring alone. Specifically, we have argued that because they are unable to store and mobilize enough fat reserves, both Cryptomys and Heterocephalus females are dependent upon regular provisioning of food by others during long periods of gestation and lactation. One would expect that reproductive females (which are dominant over and much less active than non-breeding females) should be able to store more fat in order to have energy reserves for prolonged development of their off- spring. Although we have not quantified their ability to store fat, our experience with both wild-caught and cap- tive C. anselli and C. mechowi indicates that, contrary to males, there is no evidence of obesity in females. Autop- sies have revealed minimum body fat in females and no difference (as noted also by Bennett et al. 1994 for C. darlingi) between breeding and non-breeding females. It should be noted at this point that fat-storing dispersers in H. glaber are almost exclusively males (O'Riain et al. 1996). Conversely, autopsy of female Heliophobius sp. (a solitary species) captured in August/September in Zambia (A. Scharff and 0. Griitjen, unpublished data) and in March to June in Malawi (W.N. Chitaukali and H. Burda, unpublished data) revealed apparent fat reserves. Moreover, female Heliophobius stored extra fat in cap- tivity. Similarly, female G. capensis (another solitary mole-rat species) apparently store fat prior to breeding (cf., Bennett and Jarvis 1988), although they are less de- pendent on such reserves because pregnancy and lacta- tion are much shorter than in Cryptomys and Hetero- cephalus. The question as to whether or not a female Cryptomys or H. glaber is able to complete pregnancy and rear her offspring alone cannot be studied experimentally since the isolation leads to social stress (Gattermann and Burda 1994), with a subsequent failure to complete preg- nancy or rear offspring, even when maintained under sta- ble conditions and fed ad libitum. Analyses of both re- productive and developmental biology in C. anselli (Burda 1990; Begall and Burda 1998), C. mechowi (Scharff 1998), and S. cyanus (Begall et al. 1999), and the phylogeny of developmental length in rodents in gen- eral (Burda 1 989b) suggest that developmental length is phylogenetically constrained, and its ecological and indi- vidual plasticity are rather insignificant. These observa-</page><page sequence="7">299 tions are in accordance with the view of Weir (1974) that long pregnancy and slow postnatal development are ba- sic hystricognath traits. Therefore, we consider slow de- velopmental rate as one of the causes rather than a con- sequence of eusociality in Heterocephalus and Crypto- mys mole-rats. (It should be noted that an alternative in- terpretation was provided by Bennett et al. 1991.) Why are the offspring in a monogamous family reproductively altruistic? Generally, a weaned offspring can choose among four strategies: (1) independent dispersal and reproduction; (2) dispersal and no reproduction; (3) remain in the natal group and reproduce; (4) remain in the natal group and not reproduce. The first strategy is the most common among mammals and can be considered evolutionarily stable. The second alternative represents a strategy re- sulting in extremely low fitness. The third strategy is not stable in that unrestrained reproduction in the parental nest by all individuals would lead to uncontrolled colony increase and increased competition for both reproduction and resources among breeders and an increased potential for inbreeding. The fourth choice is a stable strategy em- ployed by helpers in cooperatively breeding mammals. If an individual stays at home and does not reproduce, it can still enhance its fitness by helping to care for its sib- lings (and its parents producing them). The question about the evolution of eusociality is not why the off- spring help and do not reproduce but instead why they do not disperse in order to reproduce. Why do most offspring in eusocial families never disperse? Although permanent philopatry or at least markedly de- layed dispersal is a key characteristic of eusocial organi- zation, underlying proximate mechanisms in mole-rats have not been examined. Generally, dispersal in mam- mals can be considered a behavioral manifestation of at- tainment of the last stage of puberty, characterized by high luteinizing hormone levels (controlling production of gonadal hormones) and attainment of a particular body mass or amount of stored fat. Theoretically, puber- ty (and thus dispersal) may be delayed or absent be- cause of generally slow developmental rates (which may be phylogenetically and/or nutritionally constrained or pheromonally inhibited) or because the external cues triggering puberty are absent (Foster and Ebling 1998). Burda (1999) suggested that puberty in mole-rats may be markedly delayed so that most animals die before dispersal is triggered (e.g., Heterocephalus; cf., O'Riain et al. 1996), and/or that the dispersal is induced (pro- voked) by an incidental encounter with an unfamiliar adequate sexual partner (e.g., Cryptomys; cf., Burda 1995). Ultimately, dispersal/philopatry opportunism (as in Cryptomys) can be expected when the ecological con- ditions determining benefits and costs of philopatry/dis- persal are markedly and unpredictably fluctuating, or when benefits (costs) of philopatry do not substantially differ from benefits (costs) of dispersal. In the case of monogamy (or a highly inbred population), a high de- gree of relatedness between siblings originating from different litters is guaranteed, thus providing a higher benefit, in terms of fitness, for individuals that stay in the natal group. There are two explanations for philopatry (cf., also Emlen 1984, 1994; Jennions and Macdonald 1994) in- cluding: (1) the cost of dispersal is higher than the cost of staying in the natal group, and (2) a tendency to stay in the natal group is an ancestral trait. Aridity food distribution hypothesis In terms of the costs of dispersal versus philopatry in mole-rats, the most widely discussed explanation is the aridity food distribution or cooperative-foraging hypoth- esis (AFDH) coined by Jarvis and Bennett (reviewed in Jarvis and Bennett 1991; Jarvis et al. 1994; Faulkes et al. 1997; Faulkes 1998) or risk sensitivity hypothesis (Love- grove and Wissel 1988; Lovegrove 1991). The AFDH sees the principal meaning of sociality as relating to ben- efits of cooperative foraging (and/or in risks of solitary foraging) in unpredictable, arid habitats where the soil is hard for most of the year and feeding resources are clumped and widely spaced. The search for widely dis- tributed food resources is assumed to be random (an as- sumption that has never been experimentally tested) and requires underground excavation beyond the abilities of a single individual. The hypothesis predicts that such habitat and resource characteristics promote: (1) larger colony size (as a working force for cooperative forag- ing), and (2) smaller individual body size (to meet ener- getic demands of the colony). While the colony size can influence the rate and the efficiency of foraging, it does not necessarily influence the social (cooperative or not cooperative; colonial, com- munal, generally familial, or eusocial) and mating (mo- nogamous, polygamous, promiscuous) structure of the group. The parameter itself does not appear to be rele- vant to the definition of eusociality (see above). Rather the AFDH is about colony size and not social structure. Therefore, the AFDH may explain why cooperative for- aging is necessary for survival in an arid habitat but it cannot discriminate between group living as a conse- quence of harsh environments and sociality or coopera- tion as a precondition for occupying harsh environments. Alexander's (1974) statement regarding primates is ger- mane to this argument: ". . . the evolution of complex so- cial structure chiefly or solely as a result of feeding ad- vantage is doubtful. It seems more likely that the feeding behavior, whether competitive or cooperative, is a result of grouping that was originally advantageous for other reasons." This argument was later extended to include the naked mole-rats (Alexander 1991).</page><page sequence="8">300 Whether smaller body size of mole-rats in arid re- gions can be interpreted as an adaptation to reduce the energetic costs of cooperative foraging is questionable. While H. glaber is the smallest mole-rat, C. damarensis is medium-sized relative to other bathyergids. Body size may represent a thermoregulatory adaptation (Bergman's rule) or it may reflect nutritional constraints. Actually, a smaller body size in individuals from arid habitats com- pared to those from mesic regions is a well-known phe- nomenon in both the solitary blind Palestinian blind mole-rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) and diverse surface-dwell- ing rodents (cf., Nevo 1991 for a review). If the AFDH is a viable explanation for eusociality of mole-rats, as advocated by some researchers (cf., among others Sherman et al. 1991, 1992; Jarvis et al. 1994, 1998; Faulkes 1998; Wallace and Bennett 1998), then one would expect to see (1) evidence of convergence among unrelated taxa in similar habitats and/or (2) evi- dence of divergence of social structure among related taxa in different habitats. Both the naked mole-rat (H. glaber) and Damaraland mole-rat (C. damarensis), two of the eusocial species (Jarvis 1981; Jarvis and Bennett 1993; Jarvis et al. 1994), live in large colonies in arid regions with patchily distributed resources, thus supporting the AFDH. Never- theless, as Lacey and Sherman (1997) indicate: "Because the AFDH was developed using information from both naked and Damaraland mole-rats, comparative analyses of these species do not provide a robust test of this argu- ment". Examination of other species of subterranean ro- dents fails to reveal further support for the AFDH. For example, there is no additional evidence for evolutionary convergence among subterranean mammals in similar habitats. Indeed, there are several species of subterra- nean rodents (Bathyergus, Heliophobius, Ctenomys, Spa- lax) which are solitary even when living (at least in some parts of their distribution) in comparatively arid habitats. In some areas, there is even overlap with social species. Thus far, there has been no evidence for divergence of social systems between species of a particular genus or between subspecies or populations of a particular species of mole-rat occupying different environments. Most, if not all Cryptomys species, are social, probably eusocial, irrespective of the habitat they occupy, even if they occur in mesic areas (with small, more uniformly distributed geophytes). Of interest may be that the largest colonies of naked mole-rats occur where food is most abundant (and therefore the risk of dispersal is low) (cf., Brett 1991). Similarly, the coruro (S. cyanus), a social subter- ranean species occurs in both mesic and semiarid habi- tats (Begall and Gallardo, in press). Worth noting is that although some authors believe that sociality of prairie voles (M. ochrogaster) evolved in response to limited food, their social organization does not vary with food availability (cf., Carter and Getz 1993; Solomon 1994; Getz and Carter 1996). Another problem with any explanation for sociality of mole-rats, especially one related to a cause and effect re- lationship between sociality and ecological factors, is the enormous spatial and temporal variability of such param- eters. While low unpredictable rainfall, clumped patchy distribution of food resources, and hard soil during dry periods may well characterize many localities, they do not characterize the whole distributional range of partic- ular species. As indicated recently by Jarvis et al. (1998), regional variation in these characteristics has not been considered in most previous studies, and species-level generalizations have been made from a single habitat. Yet even within a small area, appreciable local differ- ences may be found. As discussed below, soil hardness is a good example of how habitats can vary. It is frequently argued that soil in habitats of naked mole-rats is ex- tremely hard for most of the year, thus preventing any ef- ficient digging and foraging during arid periods. This is, however, a simplification because all heavy (clay) soils with high contents of iron and manganese oxides become extremely hard during the African dry season. The soils in generally mesic southeast Central Africa may become as hard as those in arid northeast Africa. On the other hand, sandy soils poor in these oxides may be very workable even during dry seasons. Wallace and Bennett (1998) considered soil hardness during dry periods to be the reason for sociality of giant mole-rats (C. mechowi). Such an explanation does not seem justified. Giant mole- rats in Zambia can be found in a variety of soil types, yet they are always social (Griitjen 1999). In contrast, pock- et gophers (Geomys bursarius) or silvery mole-rats (Heliophobius argenteocinereus) are solitary subterra- nean rodents, but they also occur and dig in different soil types, some of which may become very hard during dry periods (Kennerly 1964; own observations, respective- ly). Furthermore, soil hardness varies not only temporal- ly and locally but also vertically, and mole-rats may avoid hard soils by digging in softer soil horizons (Gruitjen 1999). Considering only soil hardness as a digging constraint is to an extent anthropomorphic. As Arieli (1990) noted, soil permeability to gases is low in heavy (clay) soils when the pores in the soil are filled with water. The hyp- oxic and hypercapnic stress in the rainy season (in mesic habitats) may represent a much greater constraint on dig- ging activity than soil mechanical hardness in arid habi- tats (cf., also Nevo 1991 for a review). Proponents of the AFDH interpret burrowing activity observable after rains and showers as digging of new foraging tunnels, thus im- plying that there is only a short window of time when the soil is soft enough to be exploited for digging and forag- ing. However, there may be digging activity during dry periods not apparent aboveground because mounds are not built and excavated soil is transported to abandoned tunnels. Observations of pocket gophers by Howard and Childs (1959) revealed less mound production during warm summers, with animals shifting their activity to deeper layers, probably to avoid temperature stress. The observable digging activity (transport of soil on the sur- face) after rains may represent a means for either replen- ishing the burrow atmosphere (Arieli 1990) or repairing collapsed tunnels (Gruitjen 1999), and not necessarily or</page><page sequence="9">301 solely the digging of new foraging tunnels. Finally, ap- petitive digging behavior after rains may be triggered not (only) by softening soil but rather by kairomones ema- nating from sprouting rootlets (Kocks 1999). Is the tendency to stay in the parental nest an ancestral trait? With respect to social evolution and divergence in the Bathyergidae, two scenarios can be suggested. First, the common ancestor of the bathyergids was solitary, and a solitary lifestyle was retained by some mole-rat lineages such as Heliophobius, Bathyergus, and Georychus, whereas the ancestors of Heterocephalus and Cryptomys inhabited arid regions invoking sociality, with the reten- tion of sociality after secondarily occupying mesic re- gions. Second, the common ancestor of bathyergids was social, and sociality was retained by Cryptomys and Het- erocephalus mole-rats, while Heliophobius, Bathyergus, and Georychus have become solitary. The first scenario seems to be favored by the majority of authors (e.g., Jarvis and Bennett 1990; Faulkes et al. 1997) because there is a general assumption that eusoci- ality is an endpoint of social evolution, with a solitary lifestyle being plesiomorphic. An assumption that euso- ciality is derived or apomorphous provides support for the AFDH and helps explain the exceptions (e.g., group living in Cryptomys in mesic habitats). However, as has been shown recently, a reversal in social behavior (in some bees and wasps) may be more common than previ- ously expected (Crespi 1996; Gadagkar 1997; Wcislo and Danforth 1997). What is the evidence that solitary behavior in bathyer- gid mole-rats was ancestral? Jarvis and Bennett (1990) provide two arguments. First, most subterranean mam- mals are solitary. Second, the earliest known fossil bathyergids were large and because the largest extant bathyergids are solitary, leading to the conclusion that the ancestral bathyergids were also solitary. There are several problems with such assumptions. Not all subter- ranean rodents are solitary (Table 2), and not all large bathyergids are solitary: e.g., C. mechowi is eusocial but in size comparable to Bathyergus janetta, and is larger than Georychus or Heliophobius. Additionally, fossils of early small bathyergids have, arguably, not been found. The scenario also assumes that, unlike the ancestors of the social genera, the lineages of Bathyergus, Georychus, and Heliophobius have never been exposed to aridity. More important, the first scenario assumes that in the absence of its main and exclusive benefit (cooperative foraging in arid habitats) group living will be selectively neutral. However, group living is costly in terms of indi- vidual fitness (see review by Ebensperger 1998; Wcislo and Danforth 1997), and in most cases, the underground ecotope should promote a solitary way of life, territorial- ity, and competition as seen for many fossorial rodents (Nevo 1979, 1995, 1999). We may therefore expect that sociality underground will be counter-selected. Conse- quently, a retention of sociality in different habitats would imply that the extrinsic advantage of cooperative foraging has not been the main factor upon which selec- tion has acted but that the advantage (or constraints which do not allow the giving up of sociality) has to be intrinsic, common to all social mole-rats (of a particular genus). There is no reason to reject the opposite viewpoint that sociality is the ancestral condition and a solitary life- style derived in some species, as first argued by Burda (1997, 1999). Mapping of character states (either sociali- ty or solitariness) onto published cladograms of the Bathyergidae (cf., Honeycutt et al. 1991; Honeycutt 1992; Faulkes et al. 1997) does not justify preferring or rejecting either evolutionary scenario, ancestral solitari- ness or ancestral sociality. Of course, as noted by Honey- cutt et al. (1991), different interpretations of the evolu- tion of sociality in bathyergids can be derived depending on which phylogenetic hypothesis one accepts. As long as the problem of intrafamilial phylogeny of bathyergids is not solved unambiguously, all possible cladograms and all possible interpretations have to be considered. Based on interfamilial phylogenetic relationships (Bathyergidae belonging in the suborder Hystrico- gnatha), one should assume that the common ancestor of bathyergids was already social (and cooperatively breed- ing) as typical of most recent hystricognath rodents. So- cial tolerance as a plesiomorphic trait in hystricognath rodents was recognized by Kleiman (1974), who noted that about 80% of the hystricognath rodent genera are social (colonial, familial, or pair-bonded). She pointed out the independence of sociality from ecological factors and related it to reproductive constraints and antipredator mechanisms. In support of the ancestral nature of sociali- ty, Burda (1997, 1999) suggested that living in groups (or at least in pairs) could have markedly enhanced the chances of survival of involuntary emigration from Afri- ca, transoceanic rafting, and founding of viable popula- tions in South America, all of which are events presum- ably associated with the radiation of hystricognath lin- eages in South America (cf., Lavocat 1974). According to our scenario, eusociality in mole-rats is a result (byproduct) of cooperative monogamy (which, in turn, is an ancestral trait in bathyergids) reinforced by living underground which, per se, constrains dispersal (cf., also Rado et al. 1992) and allows continuous rather than seasonal breeding leading to a rapid overlap of gen- erations. Longevity, slow prenatal and even slower post- natal growth and development may have played roles in establishing eusocial families in mole-rats but, as the case of social voles shows, these factors are not a general prerequisite for eusociality. Assuming that an ancestral social bathyergid was subjected to the same selective pressures as other subterranean mammals (cf., Nevo 1979, 1991, 1995), we can conclude that its descendants tended (independently and convergently) to become soli- tary. The rate of abandoning the social way of life may have been different along various bathygerid phylogenet- iC lineages.</page><page sequence="10">302 We suggest that the appropriate question concerning the evolution of eusociality in mole-rats should be: why did Bathyergus, Georychus, and Heliophobius become solitary rather than remaining social like their counter- parts, Cryptomys and Heterocephalus, and why could Cryptomys and Heterocephalus not abandon the social way of life?
