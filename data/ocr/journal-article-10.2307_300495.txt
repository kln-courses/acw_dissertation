As many of the chapters were written years ago, these volumes may hold more interest for those not specializing in early Rome and the middle Republic than for those who keep up with current publications. It is perhaps appropriate, then, that the journal's editors have asked an imperial historian for an outsider's reaction. It should go without saying that no review of two volumes running to I ,400 pages written by nineteen authors can hope to do justice to all of the chapters. Indeed, what follows can be characterized as arbitrarily selective. The project The weight and expense of the volumes will present an aura of authority to readers, especially when placed in the reference section of a library. In what sense are these voiumes authoritative? Certainly the authors are excellent scholars with authority in their fields. Yet the editors are quite explicit that the volumes are not meant to be definitive - indeed, the differences of views are scrupulously cross- referenced in the footnotes in Volume vii. 2. The reader who follows up the cross-references may come away with a sense of disappointment that we are no closer to resolution of many of the most basic and central issues of early Roman history than in the first edition. Astin's chapter in Volume viii, 'Roman government and politics, 20z-134 B.C.', is the only one to give a systematic critical review of the variety of previous approaches to his subject - a treatment that may be more helpful than bare acknowledge- ment of differences of opinion to be found in other chapters. The whole project of The Cambridge Ancient History is of course characterized by multiple authorship, which has benefits and creates problems. Among the benefits are not only the individual expertises of the authors but also a sense of disputes about historical interpretations that lay-readers often fail to appreciate. Though Volume VII.2 does offer varied views, it strikes me that the range of reconstructions of early Rome comes from a relatively narrow band that might be characterized as 'conservative'. Thus, while the lay-readers may be puzzled by the lack of consensus, the absence of any truly radical reinterpretations may also leave them not fully aware of how fragile the early Roman narrative is. The problems of multiple authorship seem to me to be particularly acute for early Roman history. In traversing centuries for which there are so few sure footings, the historian grows persuasive through the coherence of his interpretative connections of those (hopefully) solid points. So the historian's treatment of the fourth-century Licinian-Sextian Rogations is integrally linked to a stand on the plebeian names on the consular fasti for the early decades of the fifth century, and the interpretation of the fourth- century Lex Poetilia is bound to be grounded in a particular understanding of personal execution for default on debt in the XII Tables. The division of the narrative of the early Republic between Drummond and Cornell allows the reader to see two different views of these central matters, but does not allow either author to develop the kind of persuasive argument that he might have if given the chance to demonstrate the coherence of his synthesis. As a result, differences of historians' judgements are displayed for the readers, but without the material needed to help themn make up their mind. Similarly, it may be hard to construct a coherent account of the extent of Hellenization from the differing assessments through the two volumes (e.g., stressed by Cornell [VII.2, 4I8] for the late fourth century with reference to coinage and cognomina, but seemingly minimized by Rawson [VIII, 431] for the early second century). The most glaring anomaly comes in Volume VII.2. North's final chapter on 'Religion in republican Rome' powerfully suggests the pervasiveness of religion in the public life of the Republic:'. . . the whole of the political and constitutional system was conducted with-in an elaborate network of religious ceremonial and regulation which had the effect of bringing the time, space and hence the validity of political action within the divine sphere' (599). Moreover, 'we tend to think of the rituals of power as no more than reflections of the reality of power, established by quite other, more practical means; but in a society which had no policemen, no secret services, no security firms, the symbolism of power was far</page><page sequence="2">I58 RICHARD SALLER closer to constituting the reality of power as well. In this sense, religion played an essential part in the functioning of ancient city life' (609). All of this may startle the reader who has read 572 pages containing only a few, scattered comments on religion. The relative neglect of religion in the other eleven chapters is in part an unfortunate result of poor evidence, as North notes, but not entirely. For instance, Staveley's discussion (447 f. ) of the turmoil caused by the politics of Appius Claudius Caecus omits any reference to the religious issue of replacing the Potitii by freedmen in an ancient cult of Hercules; Cornell notes the reform in passing (410). Yet Livy (IX.29-30) stresses this as an example of how Appius Claudius upset the established order and was struck blind for provoking the anger of the gods (cf. North, 622). Volume viii gives little more attention to religion. The religious ferment of the years 2I8-20I B.C. is omitted from the narrative of the Hannibalic War in chapter 3. Instead, the recall of Fabius Cunctator from Apulia on 'religious business' in 217 B.C. is treated as a 'pretext' for the 'real reason' (5I). It would be very interesting to see North attempt a synthetic narrative of republican history to show how these and other episodes with religious dimensions could be interpreted as integral elements of the story. Sources and method In view of the crucial and excruciating source problems for early Roman history, Ogilvie and Drummond's admirably rigorous first chapter of volume VII.2, 'The sources for early Roman history', encourages optimism that a firm basis is being laid for the coming narrative. The early Roman historiographical tradition is reviewed, and the principal surviving work from that tradition, Livy'sAb urbe condita, is very critically assessed: 'he is basically retailing at second, third or fourth hand the evidence of earlier historians and doing so with prejudice and without a critical or scholarly intent. Since the works of these earlier historians do not survive, it is a nice judgement how far Livy has reproduced them accurately and how far they, for their part, were in any position to give an authoritative account of early Roman history. Every scrap has to be scrutinized' (9). The unreliability of the annalistic tradition makes authentic survivals from early Rome especially precious. So the bits of evidence from the antiquarians are given more weight, as are the consular fasti. On the other hand, the early inscriptions are discounted because of their brevity and lack of context. The pontifical records do not provide a basis for confidence in the annalistic narrative because it is uncertain when they began and what might be the 'kernel of truth' contained in them. As for the hope placed in the oral tradition, Ogilvie and Drummond recommend caution: 'it is an attractive conjecture that in a traditional, predominantly oral society a broad consensus on the major phases or landmarks of Rome's internal and external development had become established among the aristocracy but if so, this can have operated only in very general terms; it will have been highly (and unpredictably) selective and much will have been vague and malleable, subject to progressive reinterpretation and modification as the perspectives and needs of society changed. Moreover, there is no reason to suppose that the earliest historians would have refrained from altering or (especially) supplementing such pre-existing traditions if (for whatever reason) that appeared justified .. .; there can, after all, seldom have been specific evidence to refute such versions. . .' (23). In sum, 'stringent criticism' is advocated, with the burden of proof on the historian 'to demonstrate how a particular datum might have been preserved before it can be considered as potentially reliable' (28). This is eminently sound methodology, but can a history of early Rome running to several hundred pages really be written to meet this standard? That burden of proof remains very difficult to meet, since the early annalistic tradition remains for the most part a black box out of which the Livian narrative emerges and the historian cannot have a very clear idea of what was going on in the box. The contemporary evidence of archaeology and early inscriptions may offer some hope, but in fact can rarely be brought decisively to bear on the central questions raised by the historical narrative. Archaeology is enriching our picture of early Rome, but as Snodgrass has pointed out with reference to early Greece, archaeology and narrative history tell two different kinds of story in ways that make it difficult to pin down the latter with the former: 'although classical archaeology can excel ... in revealing man the maker with startling clarity, man the doer is a different and much more elusive quarry' (An Archaeology of Greece: The Present State and Future Scope of a Discipline, 66). Torelli's chapter on 'Archaic Rome between Latium and Etruria' advocates a more positive position, concluding that 'the reader will be able to co-ordinate for himself this sequence of major archaeological events with the historical data which emerge from the following chapter by A. Momigliano. . .' (5i). But in the following chapter Momigliano himself thought it 'prudent to give separate accounts of the archaeological and of the literary evidence...' (56). More might be anticipated from the written evidence of archaic inscriptions. For instance, the lapis Satricanus, a short dedication to Mamers by the sodales of Publius Valerius, is used as evidence in four chapters. It is taken by Momigliano as 'confirmation' of the presence of roving band chiefs in archaic central Italy (97). Yet as Drummond points out, the few inscribed words leave too many questions unanswered to confirm very much (I I and 58). In a different context North rightly cautions against taking 'occasional recorded facts' and building a straightforward narrative from them. 'It is only if the recorded facts could be fitted into a known scheme of development that they could be raised to the</page><page sequence="3">PROGRESS IN EARLY ROMAN HISTORIOGRAPHY I59 significance of a historical process' (577). The known scheme in this case rests on tenuous foundations, and it is easy to imagine the few words of the lapis Satricanus being confidently used to support an entirely different narrative sequence. The historian who really adheres to the burden of proof laid down in the first chapter will, I think, have only a very limited narrative left, and that would be unacceptable as a 'reductive' approach to the literary tradition (the opposite of the 'non-reductive interpretation' advocated by Torelli in Vol. VII.2, 5i). There is a general fear of missing something on account of too rigorous a method. Momigliano acknowledges in 'The origins of Rome' that 'we do not yet know how the Roman tradition about the monarchic position took shape' (go) and decides not to use the leges regiae as evidence but adds the lament that 'in doing so we may well miss some interesting facts' (io6). Clearly there is a sense of reluctance about following the tough-minded methodology of North, who is willing to allow for the possibility that 'in the present state of our knowledge, no valid basis exists for analysing [Roman religion's] early development. We could construct a priori theories, but they would be incapable of verification' (582). How does an historian write plausible history without meeting the strict burden of proof advocated in ch. i ? The rhetorical devices used to shift that burden make for an interesting study. The historian may employ words like 'plausible' and 'probable' to diminish the reader's expectations for data whose preservation can in fact be traced. Sometimes those words come in such rapid succession, however, that the reader may have doubts. In his discussion of the Etruscan kings of the mid-sixth century, Momigliano writes: 'the colourful wife of Tarquinius, Tanaquil, . . . seems plausible in that society of adventurers. It is another matter when it comes to believing that Tarquinius doubled the Roman cavalry or that he was murdered by a faction of the sons of Ancus Marcius and succeeded by his protege Servius Tullius. ... Servius Tullius, a Latin king and reformer thrown in between two Etruscans is too improbable a figure to have been invented' (gif., my emphases). Plausibility and improbability in a passage like this may strike the reader as too easily manipulable to provide secure criteria for assessment of the tradition. So also when Drummond accepts the first plebeian secession as 'credible' (2I6) but rejects the early plebiscites 'as at best unproven' (222). Could not the secessions also be discarded on the standard of 'at best unproven'? The reader coming across the 'sardonic' statement of R. M. Ogilvie (quoted with approval at 279), 'we are not compelled to disbelieve either the notice or the names [associated with the colony to Ardea]', may wonder just how much would be excluded from the annalistic narrative of early Rome on the criterion of what we are 'compelled to disbelieve'. More troubling are the references to 'genuine popular memory' (287) and 'traditional facts' (29I) to justify elements of the narrative. We are asked to accept these, 'unless we dismiss the whole tradition as worthless' (338) and believe that the annalistic historians 'deliberately fabricated out of nothing' (36I). There is a crucial ambiguity in the phrase 'genuine popular memory' that is glossed over. Does 'genuine' mean that the populus remembered or repeated some such story at some time? Or does it mean that the oral tradition accurately preserved information about early Rome? To prove the former is difficult enough; to demonstrate the latter is usually impossible; and the latter is presumably what is needed to justify, e.g., the inclusion of the tale of Coriolanus in the narrative. To give the reader the choice between acceptance of 'traditional facts' or belief in wholesale fabrication by the annalists is to set up a false dichotomy. As ch. i indicates, everything we know about oral tradition should make us think that elements of stories about the past were reworked by each generation, with the result that the popular memory could be 'genuine' or 'authentic' but far from 'factual' in the historian's sense. Since oral tradition remains important as a basis for the early Roman narrative, it would have been helpful to have each author confront this problem directly. But none offers the sort of detailed analysis of the modes of oral transmission recently presented by Wiseman (RS 79 (I989), I33-5), who identifies various contexts ranging from the more institutionalized (dramatic performances) to the less (drinking songs) to the completely informal (nurses' stories). The accuracy of the transmission surely depended on the mode, and the scraps of information collected by Wiseman leave the historian well short of knowing how any particular story was handed down through the generations or might have been reshaped. Predispositions and interpretations As a result of the slippery evidential grounding and the flexibility of the rhetoric of the plausible, the contributors to Vol. vii.z differ on the most basic questions - e.g., the nature of the-patrician-plebeian distinction and the 'strugglh' (compare Drummond, 176, z38ff. with Cornell, 325, 339). It is as if the historians are trying to reconstruct a jigsaw puzzle missing all but a few of the pieces: they cannot agree on which pieces actually belong to the puzzle and should serve as a starting point to piece the whole together; moreover, the few pieces available do not fit together (or fit too easily) because they have been warped through the ages. Given the latitude needed in choosing the pieces and forcinog them together, much depends on the predisposition of the historian. From the chapters of this volume several polarities in historians' predispositions emerge.</page><page sequence="4">I6o RICHARD SALLER The first polarity might be described as conservative versus creative, as measured by how much of the annalistic tradition in Livy the modern historian wants to save. Generally, the contributors are conservative, but some are more willing than others to take the pieces of Livy's puzzle apart and reconstruct them in a different way. Drummond's chapters on the fifth century are the most conservative and cautious. He is intent on saving the consular fasti and the basic annalistic interpretation of them. Even to believe that the apparently plebeian names on the early fasti are really plebeian would require too 'radical' a revision of the tradition about early patrician monopoly of high office; instead, he prefers to believe that the names belonged to patrician families who disappeared from the historical record soon after (176). Drummond thus preserves the annalistic story of a unilinear development toward recogni- tion of plebeian rights and privileges. Cornell reinterprets the evidence to find more ebb and flow in early republican history, with patrician power increasing in the early fifth century down to the ban on intermarriage between patricians and plebeians in the XII Tables, followed by a decline in patrician monopoly until in the later fourth century a rudimentary democracy briefly emerged and was aborted (339, 39I) It is difficult to choose between these two credible alternatives: unilinear stories ought to arouse the suspicion of historians, but Drummond rightly points out how slender is the evidence for the development of patrician exclusivity in the first decades of the Republic. A more interesting difference lies in the predisposition to see early Rome as different from classical Rome, as against the inclination to assume that early Rome was similar unless demonstrated otherwise. Of course, the tendency to assume that early Rome or the early Republic was quite different goes back to the Romans themselves, who thought of their ancestors as morally superior. No contributor voices that nostalgic view, although Staveley does portray the third century as the 'golden age of stable and ordered government' (445). Major social and political theorists of the modern era have drawn on the supposed otherness of early Rome to construct their evolutionary schemes - e.g., Sir Henry Maine's development from Status to Contract. Shadows of the evolutionary view linger in the new edition. Momigliano characterizes archaic central Italy of the sixth century as in a transition from a pre-state society, with warrior chiefs followed by bands of dependents, to a centralized state (passim, esp. 97, io0 f.). This characterization may well be right, but the evidence for it is so fragmentary that the sceptic may suspect its plausibility depends on our sense of social evolution as much as the scraps of evidence. Evolutionary schemes lurk in some other chapters in the form of covert assumptions about cultural hierarchies. Native peoples like the Libyans are said to have been 'culturally very inferior to their masters', the Carthaginians (504). The Carthaginians in turn are characterized by 'slyness and cruelty' as a foil for the charismatic Greek Pyrrhus (484) and in their dourness 'seem to have neglected all fields of artistic pursuit' (5 I 3). Scullard's chapter, 'Carthage and Rome', does not wholly escape the Romano- centric bias of our sources. In assessing Carthaginian culture he writes: 'Unlike the early Roman authors who began by translating Greek epic and tragedy, the Carthaginians seem not to have felt the need for any imaginative literature. . .' (513). The comparison gives the Romans too much credit, since 'the early Roman authors' were not born in Rome or bred in Roman culture but came to Rome as slaves and immigrants. More generally, there is a danger that supposed cultural hierarchies may be taken by lay- readers as an implicit justification for conquest. It is refreshing, then, to find Harris in Vol. VIII addressing these suppositions directly: the Spain that Rome conquered was not 'entirely primitive' (i I9), and Carthage had a 'high culture' that 'was murdered, with very little regret, by the Romans' in I46 (i62). Drummond and North consciously challenge evolutionary schemes in their chapters, working back in time from later republican history on the premise that society and religion probably did not change unless there is cause to believe otherwise. Drummond finds no good reason to believe in the existence of an early era of clan domination; on the basis of evidence for later Rome, he doubts that agnatic kin had a corporate existence and that clients were tied to patrons as tenant farmers (I 50-54; cf. Cornell, 331). Having discarded the idea that early Rome was somehow fundamentally different, Drummond is able to draw on comparative evidence from peasant studies to present a valuable sketch of the early Roman economy (I i8 ff.). In his chapter on religion North demolishes the evolutionary schemes that portrayed Roman religious history as a development from animism to anthropomorphism. In place of Warde Fowler's developmental account of an original Roman religion declining under foreign influences, North, reading back from the later Republic, offers a more constant picture in which the Romans again and again integrated foreign deities and ideas into their religious practices (58i f.). The method of reading back in time on the provisional assumption of no change has implications for one of the most basic criteria for assessing the tradition: the search for retrojections of later republican events and structures into the traditions about earlier periods. Cornell describes the populist politics of men like Q. Publilius Philo in the late fourth century and concludes that 'the system involved a substantial democratic element that was largely absent in the later period when the senate controlled the government and the outcome of elections had little effect on the general direction of policy' (347). This idea is attractive, but it could be doubted on the grounds that the source, Livy, is reading back late republican political conflicts between oligarchs and populists into the fourth century. Whether we accept Cornell's view will depend on whether we assume fourth-century politics could have been sufficiently</page><page sequence="5">PROGRESS IN EARLY ROMAN HISTORIOGRAPHY i6i similar to late second-century politics to produce annalistic narratives in similar terms. It seems to me to be very hard to find independent grounds to make a judgement. Instead of assumptions of otherness of early Rome, the historian may be guided by unselfconscious assumptions of sameness that lead to the ascription of anachronistic meanings to Roman behaviour. Staveley's chapter, 'Rome and Italy in the early third century', offers a wealth of material but sometimes interpreted in suspiciously modern terms. Rather than beginning with a general discussion of Roman political culture of the period (as Astin does for the second century in ch. 6 of Vol. viii), Staveley presents a narrative in terms reminiscent of contemporary British politics: nobiles were repeatedly elected to magistracies and took their places in the senate because 'power called not only for skill and experience in her executive magistrates, but also for a certain consistency and stability in policy- making.. .' (444); nobiles built their influence through the support of 'backbenchers' who acted as 'potential harvesters of votes' (447); and the senatorial discussions about foreign policy matters like entry into war with Carthage focused on the economic growth of Rome and its role as a Mediterranean power. Very little ancient evidence is adduced to justify these interpretations. The accounts of Polybius and Livy are not taken very seriously when they represent the contention during Appius Claudius' censorship as a debate over honour and status, and the discussion preceding the First Punic War as a moral question regarding the Mamertimes (compare Staveley's account, 448 with Scullard's, 540). Polybius and Livy may have misunderstood the nature of the political discussions and values of fourth- and third-century Rome, but one would like to see the nature of Roman political culture addressed explicitly rather than having contemporary political terms slipped in to describe important political issues. Franke's following chapter on 'Pyrrhus' takes us back to the sort of history in which 'great men' are judged in more or less timeless terms that minimize the importance of specific historical cultures for understanding the meanings of men's actions, which are taken to be transparent and unproblematic. So the chapter begins with the statement, 'There was a treaty between Rome and the South Italian Greek city of Tarentum . . .' (456), and after an informative, detailed narrative culminates with an assessment of Pyrrhus' personality. It was a personality that found its own kingdom 'a very limited and limiting field in which to develop. .. ' (461 ). Consequently, Pyrrhus took his army abroad, though he was 'not a man who thrived on the adventure of war. . .' (467). The king's statues 'bear witness' to a personality that 'united military genius with personal courage, diplomatic skill with winning charm, charisma even. . .' (484). As Franke points out in his final paragraph, Pyrrhus' personality holds a timeless fascination (485). If personalities of historical figures are so transparent, they can be directly interpreted without the need to consider the mediation of a specific cultural context. Roman imperialism The principal theme of Vol. viii is Roman expansion. It might have been expected that the problems of multiple authorship would have been most apparent in the treatment of this pervasive theme. In fact, the reader will find no obvious contradictions between chapters or even volumes. There are no advocates of defensive imperialism in these pages and the aggressiveness of Rome is not minimized. Some smaller differences of interpretation do emerge. Cornell in three chapters at the core of Vol. VII.2 takes the story of the expansion of republican Rome down through the Samnite wars, an expansion that picked up pace through the middle of the fourth century. Cornell effectively sets the stage for later events by pointing to the general features of Rome that contributed to the unparalleled progression of wars. He stresses that there is no reason to pass moral judgement on Rome; rather, we should try to understand the phenomenon in terms of Roman values, interests and habits of action. With broad strokes, Cornell paints a picture of the persistent belligerence of a 'warrior' society possessing a culture with 'a military ethos' (384). This analysis of basic traits prepares the reader for Staveley's continuation of the story into the third century: far from a hiatus after Rome's victory in the Third Samnite war, 'the advance of her authority ... was even more spectacular' in the decade and a half down to 264 (422), in the years following the First Punic War 'Rome's wars in the north of the Italian peninsula were largely of her own devising' (43 1) . In this context, Franke's statement (467) that 'Rome urgently needed a long period of peace' after the Samnite wars seems pointless: 'needed' from whose point of view? In Vol. viii Harris, Errington, Derow, and Habicht continue the story of expansion down through the first two-thirds of the second century. Like Cornell, Harris interprets Roman expansion in the west with reference 'to the internal workings of state and society of the conquerors' (I 07) - in other words, an understanding must be firmly situated in the Roman social and cultural context. In describing the subjugation of Cisalpine Gaul and Spain and the annihilation of Carthage, Harris gives more attention than other contributors to what the Romans got out of their wars - e.g., the 5632 prisoners and 350,000 denarii in the campaign in Cisalpine Gaul in I77 B.C. (I I6), and more generally the territory needed to satisfy 'Roman greed for land' (II17). While not offering an apologetic for Rome, Errington in 'Rome against Philip and Antiochus' is perhaps less sensitive to Roman values in accounting for the Second</page><page sequence="6">I62 RICHARD SALLER Macedonian war in terms of an 'Eastern lobby' and the aims of revenging 'a stab in the back' and of 'winning the "hearts and minds" of the Greeks' (262). In writing wryly that Manlius (cos. I89) 'became expert on the affairs of Asia-Minor by leading a major plundering expedition into central and southern Anatolia' (288), Errington inadvertently (I think) casts doubt on the whole notion of regional 'expertise' among senators in foreign affairs. Derow's understanding of Roman imperialism in the second quarter of the second century is couched in the contemporary terms of Polybius: the senate expected the Greeks to bring their affairs before it, using various opportunities to weaken leading Greek powers (3i8); the rhythm of war was both ingrained and consciously perpetuated, as in the declaration of war on the Dalmatians in I56 to keep up the martial spirit of Italian men (320 f.). Habicht's chapter, 'The Seleucids and their rivals', portrays a 'treacherous' and 'utterly dishonest' Rome whose policy from 172 B.C. was driven by 'arrogant' aggression (333, 382 f.). Habicht effectively dispenses with the possibility that Rome was motivated by fear and conveys the grovelling obsequiousness of the Greeks in approaching Roman power (385). The terms of moral disapprobation applied to the Romans are justified to some extent by the moral debate going on in Rome during the Third Macedonian war, but it is not always clear whether these terms represent ancient judgement or Habicht's own indignation. If the latter, then we may wonder with Cornell about whether there is any point. The chapters on Roman expansion are more satisfactory than those famous chapters of Holleaux in the first edition. As a group, however, they have certain shortcomings through no fault of the authors. As has been pointed out in the past, the duration and intensity of Roman imperialism make it imperative for the historian to analyze the phenomenon as a whole, and not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. The division of labour in these volumes does not give any one author the responsibility for the sort of systematic, general analysis that would be so helpful to the lay-reader. The chapters offer the reader an interesting range of views on imperialism, but their value as a sampling of the historiography on the subject is somewhat mitigated by the fact that some were written more than ten years ago. W. V. Harris's Warand Imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-7o B.C. (I 979) and Erich Gruen's The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome (I984) are not acknowledged in Errington's or Derow's chapters, even though they have a direct bearing on the formulation of Roman imperialism in those chapters. Was there intentional irony in the editors' choice of Gruen's book as the example of their format for citation (Vol. viii, ix)? 'Exceptional advances' The Preface to Vol. Vii.2 justifies the separation of Hellenistic and early Roman history into two volumes and the expanded treatment on the grounds of the 'exceptional advances, both of discovery and interpretation,' made in the past half century. While there is likely to be debate about what constitutes an 'exceptional advance' in the interpretation of the annalistic tradition, the increase in archaeological evidence available does promise major progress in certain areas. Once we have accepted the idea that archaeology will shed more light on 'man the maker' than on 'man the doer', important conclusions can be drawn, as these volumes demonstrate. Historians have known in a general sense about influences from the eastern Mediterranean on central Italian culture. The archaeologists are increasingly able to place those contacts in a concrete physical context. For instance, Torelli's chapter on 'Archaic Rome between Latium and Etruria' offers an interesting discussion of emporia, with their shrines built to eastern deities from the early eighth century, as nodal points for cultural exchange (48 ff.). The processes of urbanization and the develop- ment of public life in central Italy are becoming clearer. The decades around 600 B.C. appear to have been crucial, with the emergence of the hoplite phalanx, the construction of urban defenses, and at Rome the paving of the Forum which provided 'the framework of political and religious life' (37). In the past historians have argued about how fast Rome emerged as a dominating city-state within the 'common culture throughout Central Italy' (I5). A case had been made (e.g., by A. Alfoldi) that the Roman tradition greatly exaggerated Rome's importance in early Latium. Cornell, however, uses archaeological and other evidence to show just how far Rome had outdistanced its Latin neighbours and every other city of Italy except Tarentum by 500 B.C. In terms of size and monumental architecture, Rome was already in a league with the other major cities of the Mediterranean (243 ff.). As such, Rome was a centre for trade and manufacture. Archaeology cannot resolve debates about economic policy-making, but it 'shows beyond doubt that Rome was an important manufacturing and trading centre in the years before and after 300 B.C.' (411)- Beyond construction and economic activity, archaeological evidence is used by Torelli and Momigliano in Vol. VII.2 and Morel in Vol. viii to illuminate social differentiation, expressed in part through burial goods and consumption of luxury items. Morel tells a fascinating story of how there emerged out of the common central Italian material culture of 300 B.C. a gap between luxury artefacts and those for daily use. The concentration of wealth in the hands of the Roman aristocracy at the expense of the poor in the second century is thus visible in the archaeological record, as common goods degenerated in quality while the nobilitas appropriated Greek art 'to define more clearly the gulf between</page><page sequence="7">PROGRESS IN EARLY ROMAN HISTORIOGRAPHY I63 itself and the common people' (51 ) . Morel shows how artefacts can enrich our understanding of social differentiation to the extent that it was represented through durable materials, but the archaeological record alone provides only a partial and general sense of development and not one in the terms of the culturally-specific categories of rank used by the Romans. The relative uniformity of material artefacts in the fourth century does not prove the absence of differentiation, but that it was not expressed through certain forms of durable materials. Further, the relation of artefacts to the specific social categories known from the written sources must be more problematic than Morel acknowledges. When he writes in regard to the plastic arts that 'Greek influence was in fact limited to the circle of the nobilitas' (5 I I), one wonders in how strict a sense 'nobilitas' is meant to be taken, since it is not obvious how we can know whether the owner of a particular piece of art was a nobilis, a new senator, a wealthy equestrian or freedman. In better documented periods the correspondence between social rank and material display was certainly not so neat. Consequently, archaeology, valuable as it may be, is no substitute for written evidence if we wish to write social history in terms of native categories rather than trans-cultural categories. Archaeological discoveries have produced 'exceptional advances', not so much because they allow us to check specifics of the literary tradition as because they allow us to situate Rome in Italy in a much fuller way than the tradition does. Torelli's chapter in Vol. VII.2 and Morel's and Gabba's chapters in Vol. viii offer many insights on Rome initially as a part of central Italy and then as the focal point of and predominant influence on Italian culture, as Roman political and social structures were replicated throughout Italy in the form of colonies. Archaeological work is showing in increasing detail which areas of Italy prospered under Roman domination in the aftermath of the Hannibalic War and which declined. These volumes offer different things to different readers. To the historian of early Rome and the middle Republic, they will serve as one expression of orthodoxy - a starting point to be challenged. Lay-readers will have a rich, solid narrative. No doubt many will read individual chapters and miss the sense of alternative reconstructions of the past to be gained by comparison of chapters. Those (few) who read the volumes from cover to cover will find that the material is generally presented in a sensible order, with a few exceptions. In Vol. VII.2 the narrative of the third century seems oddly disjointed: Staveley's narrative of domestic and foreign affairs down to 220 B.C. is followed by a chapter nearly as long on Pyrrhus and another chapter on Carthage and the First Punic War, with Pyrrhus given nearly as much space as the events of the remaining three-quarters of a century. This is presumably a nod in the direction of writing a history of the entire ancient Mediterranean world, yet the chapter on Pyrrhus seems intrusive and shows that these volumes really are organized around Rome as ultimately the dominant power. (One has to sympathize with the editors, whose problem of incorporating disparate strands into a unified narrative is as old as the genre of history itself.) It also seems odd to place the chapter on religion in Vol. VII.2 rather than viii, since North emphasizes the lack of reliable evidence for early Rome. In the period covered by Vol. viii the evidence becomes more plentiful, but North makes only passing reference to, e.g., the Bacchanalian affair because it lies beyond his brief. The narrative order in Vol. viii is straightforward, but the reader might have been better served by grouping the chapter on Roman expansion in the west with the others concerning the eastern Mediterranean and adding a chapter of general analysis of imperialism. For imperial historians, these volumes offer an opportunity to take stock of the Rome from which their Rome developed. My sense is that economic and cultural historians of the imperial era are likely to be most satisfied with the 'advances'. Historians of political and social institutions, still attested principally by the annalistic tradition, may well find their origins in early Rome frustratingly opaque. For the social historian seeking explanations of the peculiar configuration of Roman social relations there remains the obstacle that by the time institutions and relationships begin to come into focus through contemporary evidence of the second century, many of the presumed changes in kinship and the wider society had apparently already occurred.
