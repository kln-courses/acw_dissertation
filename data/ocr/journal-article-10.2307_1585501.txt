<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS IN EXODUS XXIII 14-19 AND XXXIV 18-261 by SHIMON BAR-ON Jerusalem Classical criticism assigns the festival calendar found in Exod. xxxiv 18-26 to J, presumed to be the earliest of the Pentateuchal sources, and its counterpart in Exod. xxiii 14-19 to E.2 This determination is inextricably linked with the prevailing view which regards the "Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xx 22-xxiii 33) as the law-book of the Elohistic document and the "Minor Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xxxiv 10- 26) as that of the Yahwistic source.3 Even scholars who diverge from this traditional method of correlating the non-Priestly law-codes with the narrative sources, acknowledging that there are literary and redac- tional relationships between the two festival calendars, adhere for the most part to the basic assumption that the earliest kernel of Israel's 'The following commentaries are cited by the commentator's name only: Rashi; Rasbam; Ibn Ezra; Bechor Shor; Nahmanides; Sfomo; Abrabanel and Mesudat David; B.

The accepted view of these two passages as belonging to two different documents-J and E-representing two literarily independent formulations, would seem not to be the result of objective study of the two texts themselves but rather of the scholarly necessity to sustain the classical documentary hypothesis. But outside the support it has pro- vided for the source-critical theory, this approach has contributed little to the actual interpretation and characterization of the two calendars. It has in fact, to some extent, actually barred the way to critical exegesis, since the theoretical model adopted has tended not only to obscure the remarkable similarity between the two texts-thus excusing schol- ars from the need to account for the existence of practically identical material-but also to enable scholars to disregard the precise differences between the two texts. In contrast to existing method, the avenue of inquiry to be pursued here will not shrink from drawing the obvious conclusion from the undeniable resemblances between the two texts; namely, that one was copied from the other.6 It will also attempt to explain why the copyist 6 The possibility that both texts have been copied from a third is, for our purposes, 163</page><page sequence="4">SHIMON BAR-ON has revised his Vorlage, altering and supplementing it as he rewrote. I shall first consider the additional material found in Exod. xxxiv as compared with Exod. xxiii; next, I shall discuss the formulational and stylistic diferences between the two texts; finally, I shall attempt to account for the isolated cases in which the text of Exod. xxxiv is lacking in comparison with the parallel text in Exod. xxiii. A. Additions in Exod. xxxiv as Compared with Exod. xxiii 1. The law of the first-born In its present form, the law recorded in Exod. xiii 1-2, 11-15 reflects the conception that the command to consecrate the first-born was given in the wake of the annihilation of "all the first-born in the land Egypt" (v. 15), and that its purpose was commemorative: to remind future generations that "it was with a mighty hand that YHWH brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage" (v. 14). This is a relatively late text, dependent upon the law of the first-born in Exod. xxxiv 19-20.7 As distinct from the law in Exod. xiii, none of the other Pentateuchal legislation regarding the first-born (Exod. xxii 28-9; Lev. xxvii 26-7; Deut. xv 19-23) is aware of any connection with the slaying of the first-born of Egypt. Moreover, this connection is totally absent from practically all other contexts, including passages which speak of the pesa offering and the ma.s6t pilgrimage. The only exception is a par- ticular stratum of the Priestly source reflected in Num. iii 13 and viii 17, where, in connection with the ceremonies of dedication of the Levites, the slaying of the Egyptian first-born is given as the rationale for YHWH's ownership of all first-born in Israel.8 The suspicion thus arises that the mention of the first-born in Exod. xxxiv in the context of the massot pilgrimage is an expansion which, as shown by the comparison irrelevant, since, as will be shown, one of the texts is in any case patently older than the other. Thus, in my formulation of the process, the secondary text was copied from the original one, while in the alternative formulation, both were copied from a common source but one is closer to it than the other. The difference is thus a speculative, theo- retical matter only. 7 This conclusion rests on a detailed analysis of Exod. xiii 1-2, 11-15, the origin and composition of which are the subject of considerable controversy. I hope to devote a separate study to this passage. 8 See C. Steuernagel, Lehrbuch der Einleitung in das Alte Testament (Tibingen, 1912), p. 160 (?40, 5c). I. Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence (Minneapolis, 1995), pp. 71-3, assigns these verses to the "Holiness School". 164</page><page sequence="5">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS to the original text still preserved in Exod. xxiii 15, the writer has added to the festival calendar. The suspicion is confirmed by a consideration of the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed". In Exod. xxiii 15 these words appear without further elaboration in connection with the massot pilgrimage, leaving the reader to wonder just what one is to bring as an offering on this pilgrimage in order to avoid seeing YHWH's face empty-handed. In their present context in Exod. xxxiv 20b, however, these same words can only be taken to refer to the offering of first- born animals during the massot pilgrimage. The writer of Exod. xxxiv has expanded the original text by interpolating the command to offer the first-born, positioning it between the basic law requiring the observ- ance of the massott pilgrimage itself and the otherwise unexplained words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed". He has thus interpreted these words to mean: do not dare to participate in the pilgrimage of mass6t without bringing along any first-born livestock as an offering to YHWH.9 Such a law, however, positively commanding the Israelite to bring his first-born animals as an offering to YHWH as a part of the observ- ance of the massot pilgrimage, is nowhere to be found in the Pentateuch. Further, this interpretation of the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" cannot possibly be their original intent; rather it stands to reason that they pertain to all three annual pilgrimages, not to that of mass6t alone.'0 This is corroborated by the summary verse (Exod. xxxiv 23): however the face of YHWH is to be seen, it is to be seen three times a year. This is precisely the manner in which the 9 See, for instance, Dillmann-Ryssel, p. 276; compare Fishbane (n. 5), p. 196. 10 This is certainly true with regard to Exod. xxiii 15, where there is no mention whatsoever of the first-born. Thus, in their original context, the words in question per- tain to the general prescription "On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me" (Exod. xxiii 14); indeed, this verse appears to be their most natural original context. Perhaps it was, and the verse could be reconstructed to read "On three occa- sions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me, and my face shall not be seen empty- handed." If so, then the possibility that the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" have been dislodged accidentally from their original placement, directly before v. 15 ('et-hag hammassot, etc.) and moved to their present location, before v. 16 (w'hag haqq.sir) should not be discounted (homoioteleuton?). Even if this text-critical sug- gestion is rejected, the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" in Exod. xxiii certainly apply to the command to make a pilgrimage itself; though in this case the location of the stipulation would have to be explained as a result of the lawgiver having mentioned it in connection with the first of the three pilgrimages, the Pilgrimage of ma.sst, and assuming it to be in effect on the other two pilgrimages as well; see, for instance, Kalisch, p. 454; Keil, p. 494. 165</page><page sequence="6">SHIMON BAR-ON words in question were understood by the author of Deut. xvi, who has actually incorporated them in the concluding summary (v. 16): Three times a year all your males shall see the face of YHWH your God in the place which He will choose, at the Pilgrimage of Unleavened Bread, at the Pilgrimage of Weeks, and at the Pilgrimage of Booths, and none shall see the face of THWH empty-handed." The fact that the text of Exod. xxxiv 19-20 leaves no option but to interpret the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" in a way utterly opposed to their plain meaning thus lends considerable weight to the supposition that this passage is a secondary expansion. These two verses in Exod. xxxiv concerning the first-born are in fact much closer in content and style to the parallel Priestly passages (Lev. xxvii 26-7 and Num. xviii 15-18) than they are to the non-Priestly ones (Exod. xxii 28-9 and Deut. xv 19-23). The term peter rehem ("first issue of the womb") in v. 19 is attested in the Priestly texts in various forms (Num. iii 12, viii 16, xviii 15; cf. Ezek. xx 26) but is completely absent from the non-Priestly legislation, which makes use of the term bekor ("first-born") only. The reliance of the first-born legislation in Exod. xxxiv on Priestly texts is thus unmistakable. In this light, the repeated use of peter and peter rehem throughout the detailed prescriptions in Exod. xxxiv 19-20, only to be replaced sud- denly, in the concluding command, by the word bekor, becomes all the more remarkable. It seems that the last clause is a corrected version of the parallel law in Exod. xxii: Exod. xxii 28b Exod. xxxiv 19-20 ...b ,nDf 'D a I Tnn 11=11n: rmnn Inn 19: "CD Clearly, the detailed provisions of the law, which employ the term peter (rehem), are the later material, while the final clause would seem " For the possibility that the existing vocalization does not represent the original intent, and that the true sense of the phrase is "see the face of YHWH" compare A. Geiger, Urschrift und Ubersetzungen der Bibel (Breslau, 18572 [18281]), p. 337; S.D. Luzzatto, Perus 'al Sefer resayah (Tel Aviv, 19702 [1845']) on Isa. i 12. To be sure, the texts of Exod. xxxiv 23 and Deut. xvi 16 could also be adaptations of the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" in Exod. xxiii 15 (see below), in which case the inter- pretation reflected is indeed the original intent. 166</page><page sequence="7">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS to be drawn from the ancient text. Yet even this final stipulation, that the first-born of human beings, are to be redeemed, has not merely been copied and proceeded by a series of late additions. This corrected version of the earlier law in Exod. xxii has been designed to make clear that the first-born of humans are not to be "given", at least not in the same sense that the first-born of livestock are "given", but rather redeemed. Without this "correction", the opposite conclusion might surely have been drawn from the text of Exod. xxii 28-9: You shall hold back your fullness or your outflow; the first-born among your sons you shall give to me. You shall do the same with your cattle and your flocks;'2 seven days it shall remain with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me. In response to this formulation of the law, in which both the first- born of livestock and those of human beings are to be "given" and no distinction seems to be made, the writer in Exod. xxxiv has introduced the explicit stipulation that the human first-born are to be redeemed. The law in Exod. xiii, which is dependent upon Exod. xxxiv, has been formulated to stress this same distinction between human beings and livestock: Exod. xxxiv 20 Exod. xiii 13 Every first-born among your Every first-born human among your sons you shall redeem sons you shall redeem The same sensitivity may underlie the Priestly legislation in Num. xviii 15: The first issue of the womb of all beings which may be offered to YHWH shall be yours; but'3 you shall redeem'4 the first-born of human beings, and you shall redeem the first-born of impure animals. The fact that the practice of redeeming both human first-born and those of impure animals is confined to Exod. xxxiv and the Priestly legislation (Lev. xxvii 27; Num. xviii 15-17), and is absent from the laws of the first-born found in the non-Priestly codes, cannot be overem- phasized. The very use of the verbal stem pdy in legal-cultic contexts 12 On the problem of the literary unity of v. 29 see Fishbane (n. 5), pp. 181ff. 13 For the word 'ak as a formula indicative of restrictive inner-biblical exegesis, see Fishbane (n. 5), pp. 184-5, 197-8. 14 Here as frequently, the infinitive absolute together with the finite verb (paddh tipdeh) is not merely emphatic but contrastive; see GKC ?113o-p. 167</page><page sequence="8">SHIMON BAR-ON is characteristic of Priestly texts in particular. The conclusion seems to be inescapable: the text of the first-born law in Exod. xxxiv is based on that found in Exod. xxii 28b, but has been rewritten to accord with Priestly legislation. This in turn has resulted in the stylistic incon- sistency peter rehem/bekdr.l5 It appears that the purpose of the secondary interpolation of the first-born law in the festival calendar when it was revised (Exod. xxxiv 19-20) was to spell out precisely what the interpolator felt could be inferred from the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" which were already present in the original text but not, in his view, sufficiently specific. The notion that the first-born of Israel-man and beast-were consecrated to YHWH when the first-born of Egypt were slain, which emerges from the Exodus narrative in its present form,16 finds expression only in Exod. xiii 1-2, 11-15 and in the Priestly ration- ale found in Num. iii 13 and viii 17. But the actual command found in Exod. xxxiv itself, namely, that the first-born livestock are to be 15 It is noteworthy that the law in Lev. xxvii 26-7, the kernel of which is admitted to be quite early even by the Wellhausen school, shows no familiarity with the redemp- tion of first-born human beings (compare the open opposition to such a procedure in the herem-law of v. 29). This law too, just like the ancient law of Exod. xxii 28-9, employs only the term bek6r. 16 In B.W. Bacon's view (The Triple Tradition of the Exodus [Hartford, 1894], p. 56 note), the words "and all the first-born of the cattle" (w'kol b'k6r behema) in Exod. xi 5 and xii 29 are a late interpolation, and the original J account of the slaying of the first-born spoke only of human beings-all the livestock of Egypt having died in the pestilence (Exod. ix 6). Even if Baentsch (p. 86) is right in claiming that this contradiction can be overcome, the awkward placement of the words wekol b'kAr behemd in both verses cannot be ignored. Twice these words occur at the end of the verse, outside the literary merism "from the first-born of Pharaoh... until the first-born of the slave-girl/ captive..." The merism is preceded by the general statement "every first-born in the land of Egypt", and it stands to reason that if the poetic elaboration that follows includes only human beings ("from the first-born of Pharaoh ... until the first-born of the slave-girl/captive .. ."), this is the original intent of the generalization as well. The words "and all the first-born of the cattle" are then clearly interpolated, apparently added to provide an etiological basis for the law that all first-born, man and beast, belong to YHWH. Remarkably, the late passage in Exod. xiii 1-2, 11-15, in which the slaying of the first-born is associated with the law of the first-born, attempts to transform this loosely connected interpolation into a integral part of the text, by creating a new merism, "from the first-born of man to the first born of beast" (v. 15)-which, however, pales considerably when compared to the original. At the very least it must be admitted that, even in the present form of the story, the emphasis is on human beings, not livestock; only the slaying of human first-born is mentioned later in the narrative, and it alone is necessary in order to coerce Pharaoh into releasing the Israelites (Exod. xii 30). Since this plague touched the entire Egyptian populace, causing even those unaffected to fear for their own lives (Exod. xii 33), the death of livestock adds nothing. The Priestly account too (Exod. xii 1-13) places the emphasis on the slaying of the first-born in Egyptian households, that is, families. 168</page><page sequence="9">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS offered on the massot pilgrimage, is not attested anywhere else in the Pentateuch. 2. The cessation of work on the seventh day Exod. xxxiv 21, which requires the cessation of work on the seventh day, interrupts the sequence of the festival calendar, occurring between the massot pilgrimage and that of Weeks. This alone suggests that this passage too, which is also not present in the original text of the festival calendar as given in Exod. xxiii, may be the result of secondary expan- sion of the earlier text. Indeed, Exod. xxiii does include the weekly cessation from work-but there (v. 12) it precedes the pilgrimage fes- tivals (vv. 14-19), following the law of the seventh, fallow year (vv. 10-11). The copyist wished to include the reference to the weekly ces- sation of labor as an integral part of the festival calendar. This prac- tice of incorporating the mention of the weekly Sabbath in the listing of annual festivals is a uniquely Priestly one, as is immediately appar- ent from the inclusion of the Sabbath in the Priestly calendars of sacred occasions in Lev. xxiii and Num. xxviii-xxix, at least in their final forms. It should also be remarked that the law of weekly cessation from labor in Exod. xxxiv has omitted the humanistic, social rationale for the Sabbath found in Exod. xxiii 12, just as the Priestly writers have done. The writer-or perhaps a later interpolator-has replaced it with "even at plowing-time and harvest-time (qa.dr) you shall cease from labor" (xxxiv 21b), thereby providing the needed justification for the unusual placement of the law, between the massot and siabiiot festivals- the latter being the festival celebrating "the first fruits of the wheat harvest (qestr)" (v. 22);'7 namely, the desire to stipulate that the harvesting 17 This interpretation of the juxtaposition can be traced to M. Piorka (1853-?), author of a commentary entitled Derek Haqqodes (published posthumously, Jerusalem 1980), who cites an earlier commentator with a similar view (vol. I, p. 112). In critical scholarship it was advanced by Klostermann (n. 5), pp. 529 n. 4, 532; for full elaboration see Jacob, p. 995. The interpretation is not jeopardized by the suggestion that the words "at plowing-time and harvest-time you shall cease from labor" are a merism, and that the intent is: at all times in the agricultural year (see Gen. xlv 6; 2 Sam. viii 12); com- pare J. Halbe, Das Privilegrecht Jahwes Ex 34, 10-26. Gestalt und Wesen, Herkunfi und Wirken in vordeuteronomischer Zeit (Gottingen, 1975), p. 190. For an attempt to connect the mention of the weekly Sabbath with the counting of seven weeks, see F. Criisemann, Die Tora.

This tendency, to stress the prohibition of labor on the weekly Sabbath, is also characteristic of the Priestly redac- tion of the Pentateuch.'8 3. The epithet "God of Israel" in v. 23 The added epithet "God of Israel" in Exod. xxxiv 23, when it is compared with the otherwise almost identical verse in Exod. xxiii, is particularly remarkable: Exod. xxxiv 23 Exod. xxiii 17 Three times a year all your males Three times a year all your males shall see the face of the Lord shall see the face of the Lord YHWH, YHWH. the God of Israel. The combination "YHWH, the God of Israel" is not widespread in the Pentateuch,'9 and it may be that its appearance in Exod. xxxiv, which, in its present narrative context, functions as part of the covenant- renewal following the calf episode, is not mere coincidence. Twice in the course of the calf narrative we are reminded that Aaron cried out "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt" (Exod. xxxii 4, 8). Perhaps the writer responsible for the revised festival calendar of Exod. xxxiv wished to take into account the total narrative context, and that the unusual "YHWH, God of Israel" is his way of referring to the perversion of the calf apostasy, when the molten god became Israel's God. In order to create the pp. 442-6; BJ. Schwartz, "Sabu'a, sabu'ot and Seven Weeks" (Hebrew), Tarbiz, 65 (1996), pp. 191-4. 18 The placement of the Priestly laws dealing with the sanctity of the weekly Sabbath alongside the commands for the building of the Tabernacle (Exod. xxxi 12-17, xxxv 2-3) is intended to stress that even the worthy task of building of the Tabernacle may not be performed on the Sabbath. This redactional intent was correctly apprehended by the rabbis and the medieval exegetes; see Mekilta de-Rabbi Sim'on bar Yohay (ed. E.Z. Epstein -J.N. Melamed, p. 222); Rashi, Rasbam, Nahmanides and Ibn Ezra on Exod. xxxi 13; Rashi and Nahmanides on Exod. xxxv 2; Rasbam and Ibn Ezra on Exod. xxxv 1; J. Wellhausen, Die Composition des Hexateuchs und der historischen Biicher des Alten Testaments (Berlin, 18993), p. 145. 19 As the expression is attested only twice more, in passages generally assigned to E (Exod. v 1 and xxxii 27), its appearance here, in a recognized J-passage, is all the more striking. 170</page><page sequence="11">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS clearest possible contrast between that hag lyhwh in which the calf was worshipped (see Exod. xxxii 5), the writer now admonishes Israel, at the moment the covenant is renewed, to make its hag by appearing before "YHWH, the God of Israel".20 The prohibition of making molten gods (xxxiv 17) may also have been formulated in order to allude to the making of the molten calf (xxxii 4, 8).21 Indeed, all the terms of the renewed covenant in Exod. xxxiv may have been designed as a corrective to the calf apostasy. In stark contrast to the broad scope and variegated nature of the laws in what the text itself refers to (Exod. xxiv 7) as the Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx 22-xxiii 33), the whole content of what scholars call the "Minor Book of the Covenant" (Exod. xxxiv 11-26) is confined to a few laws against idolatry and the calendar of haggim-pilgrimages. These two are the very areas in which the Israelites are said to have committed offense against the deity by worshipping the calf: they cel- ebrated a hag (xxxii 5) and sacrificed and prostrated themselves before a molten calf (xxxii 6, 8).22 4. Verse 24 We come finally to verse 24, which enlarges upon the recapitulation of the command to appear before YHWH three times a year. Prac- tically no scholar disputes the attribution of this passage to a redactor who assumes the centralization of the cult, and who seeks to encourage pilgrimage to the single shrine on the feasts.23 The requirement that the entire people make a pilgrimage, all on the same date, to a single shrine, which may lie at some distance from one's own locale, must lead to prolonged absences from one's ancestral homestead. The under- standable anxiety about leaving the entire country virtually unprotected from the neighbouring peoples is alleviated by the lawgiver in the pro- mise that "no man will covet your land",24 an expression reminiscent 20 Compare the longer commentary of Ibn Ezra on v. 23. 21 'elohe mass&amp;ek, attested only once more in the Bible (Lev. xix 4); see Keil, p. 566. 22 'egel massekd; see M.

Halbe [n. 17], pp. 162-7 denies the unity of the passage, assigning to the Deuteronomic redactor only the first half of the verse; his arguments are not compelling. 24 The first-person form should not be taken as addressed to the individual landholder 171</page><page sequence="12">SHIMON BAR-ON of Deuteronomic phraseology such as "no man will stand before you" (Deut. vii 44; cp. xi 25). The need to encourage and persuade is equally characteristic of Deuteronomic style; indeed the verse as a whole is of a distinctly Deuteronomic flavor.25 Note too that the conclusion of the verse is a resumptive repetition, in characteristically chiastic form, of the beginning of the previous verse, further corroborating its expansion- ary nature vis-a-vis Exod. xxiii: Exod. xxxiv 23-4 Exod. xxiii 17 v. 23 -- Three times a year Three times a year all your males shall see all your males shall see the face of the Lord YHWH, the face of the Lord YHWH. God of Israel. v. 24 For I will drive out nations before you, and enlarge your territory. Nor shall any man covet your land, when you shall go up to see the face of YHWH your God three times the year The addition of verse 24 is thus an inner-biblical midrash, inspired by the viewpoint and style of Deuteronomy. It stands to reason that it too has been appended to the festival calendar by the author who created the festival calendar of Exod. xxxiv by expanding and revising the more ancient calendar of feasts found in Exod. xxiii. B. Changes in Exod. xxxiv as Compared with Exod. xxiii 1. The name sabu'ot and the designation 'first-fruits of the wheat harvest" Exod. xxiii 15 Exod. xxiv 22 And the Pilgrimage And you shall make a Pilgrimage of the Harvest, of Weeks (saba'ot) but rather the nation as a whole. The practical question how realistic the requirement to make a pilgrimage could be in the light of the demand for centralization is beyond the scope of this study. 25 Compare the expression "drive out nations before..." to Deut. iv 38, ix 4, 5, xviii 12 (see M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School [Oxford, 1972], p. 343), and the phrase "enlarge your territory" to Deut. xii 20, xix 8 (Kuenen [n. 23], p. 250 [?13, n. 32, 5e]; Baentsch, p. 284). 172</page><page sequence="13">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS of the first fruits of your produce, of the first fruits of the wheat harvest, whatever you sow in the field; and the Pilgrimage of the and the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering... Ingathering If the common view of Exod. xxxiv as the earlier of the two festival calendars were correct, it would be difficult indeed to explain why the supposed later author of Exod. xxiii would omit the designation of the date of the second annual pilgrimage as the time of the first-fruits of the wheat harvest. The opposite, however, is not at all surprising: in place of the earlier, more general text, designating the time of the fes- tival as that of the first-fruits of "whatever you plant in the field", the more explicit reference to the first-fruits of the wheat harvest was sub- stituted in the later text of Exod. xxxiv. In making this substitution, the revisor may even have thought that the ancient law stood in oppo- sition to other festival calendars with which he was already familiar. The requirement to celebrate a pilgrimage at the harvesting of "the first fruits of your produce, whatever you sow in the field" (xxiii 26)- i.e., at the beginning of the grain harvest-may have seemed to him not to allow for the 'mer-ritual required by Lev. xxiii 10. According to the law in Leviticus, this ritual, which is to be observed at the beginning of the harvest, takes place a full seven weeks before Pentecost. This being so, the author of Exod. xxxiv is likely to have felt com- pelled to alter the festival calendar of Exod. xxiii in order to alleviate the tension between it and the Priestly law. He has accomplished this first by substituting "the first fruits of the wheat harvest" for "the first fruits of your produce, whatever you sow in the field".26 In this manner, he has prevented what would for him have been a misapprehension, namely, that this pilgrimage was to take place at the beginning of the grain harvest, insisting instead that the intent of the law was in fact narrower than this, and that it referred to the wheat harvest alone. Second, he has replaced hag haqqdsfr "the Pilgrimage of the Harvest" with hag siabi'ot "a Pilgrimage of Weeks"-an obscure designation to be sure, and one for which the literary context in Exod. xxxiv provides no explanation, but which is clearly intended to refer to the holy day occurring after the counting of seven weeks required by the Priestly legislator in Lev. xxiii 15 (cf. Deut. xvi 9). The ancient calendar of feasts in Exod. xxiii 14-19 thus presents 26 The words "when you gather in your produce from the field" may have been omitted in the wake of the omission of the counterpart "your produce, which you sow in the field" (v. 16). 173</page><page sequence="14">SHIMON BAR-ON the Pilgrimage of the Harvest as occurring at the beginning of the harvest season. It is alone in doing so; this is the only biblical passage in which the designation hag haqqadsr is attested. In the remainder of the Pentateuchal festival calendars the feast is referred to as hag sadb'Jot (in addition to Exod. xxxiv 22, see Deut. xvi 9; cf. besdbuf'otkem, Num. xxviii 26) or yom habbikkurinm (Num. xxviii 26), and it is held seven weeks after the beginning of the harvest. According to the Priestly leg- islation of Lev. xxiii, the beginning of the harvest is to be marked by the 'omer-dedication ceremony (Lev. xxiii 10-14), not by the Pilgrimage of the Harvest. By referring to the latter as hag s'ab'jot and by char- acterizing it as the opening of the wheat harvest, thus freeing the ear- lier date of the harvest of the first-ripening grain-barley-for the 'cmer ceremony, the author of Exod. xxxiv 18-26 has undertaken to harmonize these otherwise irreconcilable laws.27 2. The date of the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering Exod. xxiii 16 Exod. xxxiv 22 and the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering and the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering, when the year goes out (besg't hassaina) the turn of theyear (teq2pat hasdnad) The phrase beset hassana "when the year goes out" in Exod. xxiii clearly refers to the end of the year. It is firmly grounded in agricul- tural life, in which, the calendar year ends, and a new year begins, when the produce of the field has been gathered in. In contrast, the expression teqzpat hassanat "at the turn of the year", which has replaced this phrase in Exod. xxxiv, is not quite as unambiguous. The term tequpap is usually associated with haqqdpa in its sense of "cycle";28 tequpat hassana occurs only once more, in 2 Chron. xxiv 23.29 It is possible 27 As correctly understood by the rabbinic exegesis; see M. Sota II 1; Sipra, Nedaba 13 (ed. L. Finkelstein, p. 94). 28 Compare Rashi, followed by most medieval and modern commentators tequ2pat hassind is thus elliptical, and designates the point at which the cycle of the previous year ends and that of the new year commences. According to this explanation the two parallel expressions t'qupat hassind and b'se't hassdna are identical in meaning. 29 As opposed to the Exodus passage, the use of the expression in Chronicles is unambiguous. The clear sense is "at the end of one year", a year after the last narrated event (A. Even-Shoshan, Hammillon Hehadas [Jerusalem, 1985], p. 1474; compare the commentary of Mesudat David). Thus, Joash receives his punishment for the murder of Zechariah ben Jehoiada (v. 22) exactly a year after the crime. Compare the account of Ahab's war against Aram (1 Kings xx 22-6), in which we find the similar expression tetsbat hassdnd in the prophetic announcement of the war and in the narrator's report of its fulfillment (vv. 22 and 26); here too the intent is evidently to state that the events 174</page><page sequence="15">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS that the substitution has actually been made here in order to obscure the unequivocal sense of "New Year" implied by the more archaic b'se't hassanda.30 The reason for this would be that the author of Exod. xxxiv wished to avoid the tension that might arise from the comparison to the Priestly literature, according to which the calendar year ends in the spring and not in the autumn (cf. Exod. xii 2). The difference between the degree of ambiguity in the two expressions is reflected in the LXX: while bese't hassadn is rendered literally en' EXZ686ou xoi utaxoz ("at the year's going out"), tequpat hassand appears as pecao?vrow rov eviavlro ("the middle of the year"), taking the "turn" of the year as its mid-point.31 3. The replacement of tizbah ("sacrifice") by tishat ("slaughter") Exod. xxiii 18 Exod. xxxiv 25 You shall not sacrifice (lo' tizbah) You shall not slaughter (l6' tishat) the blood of my sacrifice the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened with anything leavened Throughout the non-Priestly literature the root zbh is used to denote sacrificial slaughter.32 Priestly usage differs: of 134 occurrences of zbh in the Bible, only eight are found in Priestly texts,33 all of which pertain to a particular type of offering: the zebah s'ldmzm. For ritual slaughter the Priestly texts widely employ the verb sht;34 seven more occurrences of occurred a year after they were predicted. This also seems to be the intent of tqiupot hayyamfn in 1 Sam. i 20 (which should perhaps be emended to tqiipat); compare TJ, Kimhi; contrastJ. Wellhausen, Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (Berlin and Leipzig, 19276), p. 90 n. 1. 30 See Dillmann-Ryssel, p. 390, Eerdmans, p. 90. Compare R.H. Pfeiffer, "The Oldest Decalogue", JBL 43 (1924), p. 304: "The feast of ingathering came in the fall, 'at the exit of the year' (2216) according to the old Canaanite calendar. During the Exile the Babylonian calendar became current and, since the year began in the spring, according to the new reckoning, the fall equinox, which was the date of this feast, could no longer be called the end of the year; it is called in 3422 'revolution of the year' (tqwpt hfnh), a term that was applied to the two solstices and the two equinoxes. There could be no clearer evidence of the post-exilic date of the 'J Decalogue'." 31 Compare J.W. Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus (Atlanta, 1990), p. 566. 32 E.g. Exod. xx 21; see R. Rendtorff, Studien zur Geschichte des Opfers im Alten Israel (Neukirchen, 1967), p. 55. 33 Lev. ix 4, xvii 5 (twice), xix 5 (twice), xxii 29 (twice). 34 Most of its appearances are in P, followed Ezekiel, Chronicles and Ezra. Moreover, the exclusively cultic use of the verb is limited to the Priestly literature; in non-Priestly sources it denotes non-sacrificial slaughter as well. See, for instance, Judg. xii 6; compare N.H. Snaith, "The verbs zabah and sahat", VT 25 (1975), p. 244; J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 (New York, 1991), p. 154. 175</page><page sequence="16">SHIMON BAR-ON sht, all of which pertain to the pesah sacrifice, all belong to demonstrably late or Priestly texts.35 These data seem to point to the conclusion that here too the writer who has composed the revised of the festival cal- endar in Exod. xxxiv has been influenced by Priestly ritual terminology. 4. zebah hag happasah as the designation for the pesah sacrrice The festival calendar in Exod. xxiii concludes with an appendix of various laws (vv. 18-19). The first prohibits the presence of leaven in sacrificial offerings (v. 18a); a similar law can be found in the Priestly legislation in Lev. ii 11.36 The second commands that the suet of the hag (the sacrifice made on a pilgrimage-festival)37 be not left until morn- ing (v. 18b).38 Though this law has no precise equivalent in the Priestly 35 Exod. xii 6 (P), 21 (redactional; see S. Bar-On, "Zur literarkritischen Analyse von Ex 12, 21-27", ZAW 107 [1995], p. 23); 2 Chron. xxx 15, xxxv 1, 6, 11; Ezra vi 20. 36 See also Lev. vi 10. M. Haran (Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel [Oxford, 1978], pp. 328-9) demurs, arguing that if Exod. xxiii 18 were indeed aimed at pro- hibiting the sacrifice of leavened meal-offerings along with animal sacrifices, the text ought to have read "You shall not burn (or put, or bring) unleavened bread on [the blood of] my sacrifice" rather than the converse "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice on leavened bread". But Haran's point is based on the precise diction of the Priestly literature, which should not be imposed upon the text of Exod. xxiii. Moreover, even in P itself the preposition 'al ("on") does not necessarily preceed the primary ele- ment rather than the subsidiary one, as evidenced, for instance, by the command "they shall eat it [the flesh] on bitter herbs" in Exod. xii 8. Haran accepts the midrashic interpretation offered by the Mekilta as the literal sense of the verse and explains the text as pertaining to the pesah sacrifice alone: You shall not offer (or, You shall not slaughter) my sacrifice (i.e., the pesa sacrifice) while there is still leavened bread in the house (p. 328). Yet this interpretation too is an attempt to read the Priestly pesah and massot laws of Exod. xii into the non-Priestly text of Exod. xxiii, a procedure which seems to me inadmissible. Further, it arises from the juxtaposition of the two separate Priestly pericopae in Exod. xii, which deal respectively with the pesah (vv. 1-13) and the ma.sst festival (15-20). It actually runs counter to the plain sense of these texts, for according to them the command to remove leaven pertains not to the pesah sacrifice but only to the first day of the ma.sot festival (v. 15). Nor can the reference to Exod. xxxiv 25 and Deut. xvi 3-4 support the assertion that Exod. xxiii 18 pertains to the pesah, as aptly put by Rofe, "inner-biblical exegesis cannot be used as an indication of the original meaning of the text" (Rof6 [n. 5], p. 38 n. 1). 37 hag here means pilgrimage sacrifice, not just pilgrimage; see E. Konig, Hebrdisches und Aramdisches Worterbuch zum Alten Testament (Leipzig, 19223), p. 98; compare also Mal. ii 3; Ps. cxviii 27. 38 The use of the verb ydlin in this stipulation cannot be taken as proof that a night- time sacrifice, i.e., the pesah, is implied, as asserted by Haran (n. 36), pp. 331-2. No positive statement is made regarding the time of the sacrifice, only a negative one regarding a delay in the burning of the suet. Similarly, in other laws employing the verb lwn, Lev. xix 13 and Deut. xxi 23: neither the laborer's work nor the execution of the criminal can plausibly be inferred to have taken place at night. The former pas- 176</page><page sequence="17">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS legislation, its counterpart, from a substantive and stylistic point of view, can be found in the Priestly prohibition of leaving the flesh of the seldmm-sacrifice until the morning (Lev. vii 15; see also Lev. xxii 29-30). The difference is that the non-Priestly passage refers to the suet only, which is not eaten but is required to be burned on the altar before morning, whereas the Priestly law speaks of the flesh which is consumed by the celebrants, and requires that this be done by morning. It seems that the idea that the burning of the suet too will have taken place by morning is self-evident in the Priestly law. In any case, this law, as the one which precedes it, is clearly a general prescription concerning all sacrifice. Surely there is no justification for taking it as pertaining to the pesah sacrifice alone, as several scholars have done.39 One must wonder therefore what can possibly have motivated the author of the revised text in Exod. xxxiv to do so: Exod. xxiii 18 Exod. xxxiv 25 nor shall the suet of nor shall the suet of my pilgrimage-sacrifice the pesah pilgrimage-sacrifice (heleb-hagg) (zebah hag happasah) be left lying until morning be left lying until morning. The revised text is anomalous in the extreme: it denotes the pesah sacrifice as a hag, a term used nowhere else in this connection.40 hag is a pilgrimage festival, and the hag everywhere associated with the pesah is the Pilgrimage of Unleavened Bread (hag hamma.sst); pesah is the name of the sacrifice, not of the pilgrimage.41 For this reason various sage is illuminated by the parallel in Deut. xxiv 14-15 ("you must pay him his wages on the same day"; compare Nahmanides). The latter passage explicitly rules out the pos- sibility that the execution itself took place at night ("you must bury him on the same day"); compare Josh. x 26-7: 'Joshua had them put to death and impaled on five stakes, and they remained impaled on the stakes until the evening; at sunset Joshua ordered them taken down from the poles and thrown into the cave, etc." 39 This approach is characteristic of rabbinic exegesis, particularly with regard to the first of the two laws Rabbi Yisma'el in Mekilta, kaspa 20; ed. H.S. Horovitz - I.A. Rabin, p. 334); it is also reflected in Targum Onkelos and in the medieval commen- taries (on the strength of the parallel in xxxiv 25), and in the commentaries of Kalisch, Keil, Holzinger, Baentsch, Beer-Galling, Jacob, etc.; see also N.H. Snaith, "Exodus 23: 18 and 34: 25", JThS N.S. 20 (1969), pp. 533-4 and Haran (n. 36), pp. 317-48. In the light of this virtual unanimity in traditional exegesis, it should be noted that the tannd'im were not all of one mind; see the controversy in the passage cited from the Mekilta. Modem opponents of the traditional interpretation include Dillmann-Ryssel, Kahana, Heinisch, Driver, Noth, Cassuto, Childs and most other critics. 40 This meaning may be intended in the redactional Exod. xii 14; see Bar-On (n. 35), pp. 25-6. 41 Haran (n. 36), pp. 329, 340. 177</page><page sequence="18">SHIMON BAR-ON emendations of Exod. xxxiv 25 have been proposed, though without textual foundation. My analysis leads to a more reasonable solution: Exod. xxxiv 25, as shown above, represents a revision of Exod. xxiii 18. The earlier text is completely unambiguous; moreover, it is now clear how the more difficult text, that of Exod. xxxiv, has come into existence. The word hag derives from the word haggi in the original text, where it referred to the offering made on the occasion of pilgrimage festivals. The author of the revised text, however, has forcibly interpreted it to refer to the pesah sacrifice alone. He has apparently done so as a result of the association aroused by the reference to leaven in the first half of the verse (Exod. xxiii 18a).42 The ancient law admonishing the offerer not to allow the suet of the sacrificial animal to be left until the morning seemed superfluous, if not indeed incomprehensible, to a post-Priestly writer; the prohibition did however remind him of the Priestly injunction not to allow any of the flesh of the pesah sacrifice to remain uneaten until morning (Exod. xii 10), and in the light of the mention of leaven in the earlier part of the verse this seemed to be the most reasonable interpretation of the law. The very fact that this verse appears as an appendix to the festival calendar supports this interpretation of the verse as pertaining to the festival laws, especially since its first half indeed does-though it speaks of all pilgrimages, not just one of them.43 Finally, it should be noted that the expression zebah hag happdsah would probably not have offended the stylistic sense of a later writer who had already become accustomed to thinking of the pesah sacrifice and the massot pilgrimage as a single, organic entity- which is indeed what they had become in later times (cf. Ezek. xlv 21). 42 See F. Hitzig, Ostern und Pfingsten im zweiten Dekalog (Heidelberg, 1838), p. 40; Eerdmans, p. 90. 43 Compare Hitzig, p. 40. The proximity to the words "the choice first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of YHWH your God" in the next verse, which may have been associated in the mind of the copyist with "the Pilgrimage of the Harvest, of the first fruits of your produce" (v. 16) may be partially responsible his having interpreted v. 18 as pertaining to the pesah and massot observances. Later, attempts were made to interpret the concluding command "You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk" in the same manner, as though it too belonged to the festival laws in general (Rasbam) or even specifically to the Ingathering pilgrimage (Abrabanel, Sforno, Dillmann-Ryssel; see also J. Spencer, De Legibus Hebraeorum Ritualibus earumque Rationibus 4 [Tubingen, 17322], pp. 310, 335-7; Kalisch, p. 460; and Klostermann [n. 5], p. 525, all of whom adduce an ancient Karaite exegetical tradition). This last is an extreme example of the trend to apply consistently the forced interpretation of the appended provisions in the calendar as pertaining to the festival laws; according to it, v. 18 would apply specifically to the pesah and ma.so6t observances, v. 19a to the Harvest pilgrimage, and v. 19b to the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering. 178</page><page sequence="19">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS C. Passages lacking in Exod. xxxiv 18-26 as compared with Exod. xxiii 14-19 1. "On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me" (xxiii 14) This command, which stands at the beginning of the festival calendar in Exod. xxiii, is missing from the revised calendar in Exod. xxxiv. Classical criticism, taking the text of Exod. xxiii as the later one, gen- erally viewed it as a late expansion, designed to add to the text of Exod. xxiii a fitting caption. This appears, however, to be nothing more than the automatic and mechanical application of a dogmatic preference for the lectio brevior, without real foundation in this case. Nor can the purported duplication in v. 17 serve as evidence for viewing v. 14 as a secondary interpolation; rather, the opposite inference is to be drawn. It is not v. 14, but rather the concluding v. 17, which com- bines elements all of which have been mentioned previously, whose integral literary connection with the remainder of the text needs to be examined: v. 17 vv. 14-15 Three times (sdlos p'amfm) a year On three occasions (islos rgadlim) a year all your males shall see the face of the you shall make a pilgrimage Lord YHWH to me... And my face shall not be seen empty-handed The comparison leads to the realization that the words "On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me" (v. 14) and "And my face shall not be seen empty-handed" (v. 15b) probably belong to the early stratum of the text of Exod. xxiii, while the summary verse (v. 17) would seem to be the later expansion. This conclusion rests on three considerations. 1. Verse 14 is formulated as first-person divine speech: "you shall make a pilgrimage to me". This is well in keeping with context, and the sequel "And my face shall not be seen, etc." (15b),44 as well as the preceding portion of v. 15 ("as I have commanded you"), follows this pattern.45 In contrast, the third-person reference to the deity in v. 17 is without parallel in the festival calendar of vv. 14-17. 44 See above, where the possibility that the words "and my face shall not be seen empty-handed" originally followed this command directly was advanced. 45 Even in its revised portion; see below. 179</page><page sequence="20">SHIMON BAR-ON 2. Had a late redactor interpolated the general command of v. 14, it is doubtful whether he would have used the rather unusual regel for "time, occasion" instead of the more common pa'am. Outside this pas- sage, the word regel is employed in this sense only in the Balaam nar- rative in Num. xxii (vv. 28, 32-3), while pa'am is well attested throughout all stages of biblical literature-101 occurrences-including late Biblical Hebrew.46 If, then, the originality of one of the two general statements in this passage is to be denied on grounds of duplication, it would seem that the more obvious candidate would be v. 17, which contains the more common word pa'am.47 3. Finally it should be noted that the differences between the for- mulation in xxiii 17 and its parallel components in vv. 14-15 are intel- ligible if seen as the result of inner-biblical exegesis. V. 15b exhibits particularly blatant anthropomorphism: the speaker is YHWH, the grammatical subject is YHWH's face, and the concern of the verse is with the deity's concrete "needs"; one is not to appear before him empty-handed. Little regard is paid to the question of who is to supply these needs; the entire passage is theocentric. The deity's face must not be seen by the empty-handed. V. 17 is formulated in striking contrast. Its central concern is not to provide for the needs of the deity but to define the obligations of the worshipper. The verse stipulates that the obligation in question devolves upon males only, and they are required to fulfill it thrice yearly. Moreover, the obligation to make a pilgrimage is implicit in the verb hgg of v. 14 according to its use in classical Biblical Hebrew.48 As distinct from this formulation, v. 17 explains the obligation of pilgrimage expressis verbis: "Three times a year all your males shall see the face of the Lord YHWH". The latter formulation would seem to be intended to clarify that the statement "On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me" in v. 14 is not exclusive; it does not aim at giving an exhaustive list of the annual appointed times but rather only those 46 Of which 15 occur in the phrase sdls pe'amzm "three times". 47 This is held, for example, by Klostermann (n. 5), p. 524 n. 5; Driver, p. 244. In the Balaam narrative as well, the interchange of silos regdlim in the episode of the ass (Num. xxii 28, 32, 33) with sAdls pe'dmm in the next chapter (xxiv 10) is indicative of the text's composite nature; see, A. Rofe, "The Book of Balaam" (Numbers 22:2-24:25).

This may therefore be an attempt to minimize the tension between the festival calendars of Exod. xxiii and xxxiv and the Priestly calendars, which include the Sabbath, New Moon, Day of Remembrance and Day of Atonement.49 The apparent repetition in the summary v. 17 cannot therefore be viewed as evidence for the secondary nature of v. 14. The more reason- able conclusion, on examination of context and style and on the strength of the parallels between the summary verse and the opening vv. 14-15, is that the summary verse is the interpolated expansion. Indeed, the view that v. 14 has been added to the text is to be rejected on other grounds as well, irrespective of the problem of repe- tition in v. 17. The words "On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me" are an indispensable part of the syntactical struc- ture of the entire pericope. Without them, v. 16 is left syntactically hanging in mid-air; hag haqqdszr and hag hd'asip are no longer in appo- sition to regdilm, replacing it as the direct objects of tdhog; rather they are a mere list, and the sentence has neither subject nor predicate. Accepting v. 14 as original creates a smooth syntactical transition: (v. 14) On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me: (v. 15) The Pilgrimage of Unleavened Bread... (v. 16) and the Pilgrimage of the Harvest, of the first fruits of your produce, which you sow in the field, and the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering when the year goes out, when you gather in your produce from the field. The alternative, namely, that the two feasts in v. 16 resume and continue the accusative hag hammass6t in v. 15 and that they too are objects of the verb tisnmr, is less likely.50 In fact the more reasonable conclusion is that the opposite is true: that in its original form, v. 15 49 In the Priestly calendar of Lev. xxiii, at least in its present form, all the days mentioned are referred to by the term mo'ddfm "appointed times" and all include the requirement of miqrd' qedes "sacred convocation". The command to appear before YHWH, however, is entirely lacking. 50 The verb timrn can best be taken as connected with the words l'm'goi hUded hde 'abib later in the verse, meaning "The Pilgrimage of Unleavened Bread you shall keep at the appointed time in the month 'abib". This interpretation is reflected in the Masoretic cantillation; compare Deut. xvi 1. This rules out extending the syntactic function of tifmJr beyond its immediate context. Indeed, the use of the verb samar-with a single command as its direct object-is suspect, this idiom being characteristic of Deuteronomic style; see Weinfeld (n. 25), p. 336, and the verse from Deuteronomy just cited. Below, it is suggested that tifmnr may not be original here. 181</page><page sequence="22">SHIMON BAR-ON was actually syntactically dependent upon v. 14 just as v. 16 is in the present text, and did not contain the verb tifmor. Critics have long noted the stratified character of v. 15.51 The detailed prescriptions it provides concerning the massot festival, out of all proportion to the other two festivals commanded in v. 16, as well as the reference "as I have commanded you" betray the work of an interpolator. Whether the reference is to Exod. xiii 6-7 or perhaps to Exod. xii 15, 18, it is certainly to a text of later date than the original festival calendar of Exod. xxiii. No consensus exists as to the original form of the verse; it may have contained only the words 'et-hag hammassot 1emoed hodes hda'abb,52 in which case both verses, 15 and 16, would be, from the syntactic point of view, completely and identically dependent on the introductory v. 14: v. 14: On three occasions a year you shall make a pilgrimage to me: v. 15: *The Pilgrimage of Unleavened Bread at the set time in the month Abib, v. 16: And the Pilgrimage of the Harvest, of the first fruits of your produce, which you sow in the field, And the Pilgrimage of the Ingathering when the year goes out, when you gather in your produce from the field. The omission of the introductory clause would of course destroy the syntactic parallelism and with it the syntactic structure of the pas- sage. Thus it is literarily impossible to view this clause as a secondary interpolation. When we turn to Exod. xxxiv, it becomes apparent that the author of the revised calendar has omitted this introductory clause without destroying the syntactical structure of the pericope. In the course of revising, he has not only disconnected the verse which, in the original text, was the grammatical continuation of the introductory clause (xxiii 16) from its syntactical dependence on the verb tahog (v. 14), he has also taken care to provide the verse with a new predicate of its own (ta'adeh leka)53: 51 Already Wellhausen (n. 29), p. 90 n. 1. 52 Klostermann (n. 5), pp. 523, 528 n. 1. 53 Note the similarity to the Deuteronomic hag hassukkot ta'daeh leka (Deut. xvi 13; compare vv. 1, 10). 182</page><page sequence="23">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS Exod. xxxiv 22 Exod. xxiii 15 And you shall make a Pilgrimage And the Pilgrimage of the Harvest, of Weeks, of the first fruits of the wheat of the first fruits of your produce... harvest... As will become clear, the writer has thus deprived the original verses of their artistic balance and poetic parallelism. For the present, how- ever, it remains to be explained why his revision included the omis- sion of the introductory clause itself, the compensation for which has cost him so dearly. The explanation seems to lie in the greater dis- tance which would have been created in the revised calendar between the introduction "On three occasions a year you shall make a pil- grimage to me" and the verse dealing with the Pilgrimages of Weeks and Ingathering (v. 22 in the present text) than had existed in the original text-the result of the inserted passage pertaining to the laws of the first-born (vv. 19-20) and the weekly cessation of labour (v. 21). Four entire verses (vv. 18-21) interposed between the predicate tdhog and the resumed accusative appositives wehag haqqdszr ... wehag hd'dsip would have been simply incomprehensible. The verse containing them thus had to be provided with its own predicate (ta'daeh), at which time the introductory verse itself became superfluous.54 2.

In this case, he has not omitted the opening "On three occasions", etc., which he found in Exod. xxiii 14; rather, he has revised and supplemented it, and moved from 183</page><page sequence="24">SHIMON BAR-ON Though the differences between the two calendars with regard to the formulation of the commands concerning these two feasts have been accounted for, a final comparison of the two verses in their entirety may enable us to see just how much the structural form of the original text (Exod. xxiii 16) has been damaged and just how thor- oughly the artistic balance between its two parts has been upset by the intervention of the interpolator. There can be no doubt that the substantive parallelism of the verse in Exod. xxiii, embellished at its midpoint by chiasmus, represents the earlier text:55 -Ilio snrn il l|D D 1111'n -rspl xm .n-'=n 0 1 ''ai n) r oBo: n1rr nsn: p^Ri im The antiquity of the verse is confirmed by the elsewhere unattested designation of the second pilgrimage as hag haqqasfr and by the sub- stantive tension with all the other festival calendars concerning the time of this pilgrimage at the beginning of the harvest (see above). Summary and Conclusions The analysis of the two festival calendars in Exod. xxiii 14-19 and Exod. xxxiv 18-26 has led to the realization that they are not two sepa- rate texts at all; rather, the latter is but a midrashic revision of the former. The inner-biblical midrashic process has solved difficulties, eliminated obscure words and phrases, and drawn conclusions based on the juxtaposition of disparate elements in the earlier text. Archaic linguistic usages have been replaced by later ones, and the discrepan- cies between the ancient festival calendar and those found in later Pentateuchal texts have been harmonized. The calendar has been posi- the beginning to the end of the text (v. 23). The eventual inclusion of this verse-in his primary form-in Exod. xxiii (v. 17) as well would then be the result of secondary assimilation, and would have caused a certain superfluity-xxiii 14 and xxiii 17 saying approximately the same thing. On the phenomenon of secondary assimilation, see Y. Zakovitch, "Assimilation in Biblical Narratives", in J.H. Tigay (ed.), Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism (Philadelphia, 1985), pp. 175-96. 55 Contra A. Toeg, Lawgiving at Sinai (Hebrew) (Jerusalem, 1977), p. 70, and others, who consider the words beospkad 'et-ma'daeka min-hassadeh to be an explanatory gloss. This is another case in which the "rule" that the shorter version is preferable is not automatically applicable. 184</page><page sequence="25">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS tioned within the account of the renewal of the covenant56 following the calf apostasy, and this context has left its mark not only on the reformulation of the commands but on their substance as well: the terms of the renewed covenant-prohibitions of idolatry and a calendar of hag provisions-all pertain to the two spheres in which the Israelites betrayed YHWH, celebrating a hag (xxxii 5) and worshipping a molten calf (xxxii 6, 8). This specialized, tendentious selection of laws stands in stark contrast to the quantity and variety which characterize the leg- islation imparted when the original covenant was made (xx 22-xxiii 33). It is evident that this conclusion is irreconcilable with classical source criticism, which views the laws included in Exod. xxxiv as an ancient law code, one of the "Sinai traditions". Our investigation has shown that, at the very least, vv. 18-26 are not an independent document at all but rather a revision of extant materials; the secondary nature of this revision is reinforced by the presence of Priestly influence and Deuteronomic style that we have seen. As noted by many scholars, Deuteronomic elements, both linguistic and theological, can be discerned in the verses preceding the festival calendar (Exod. xxxiv 11-17) as well.57 This has generally been taken as evidence of Deuteronomic 56 The covenant renewal, of course, is found in the present form of the text of Exod. xxxiv; the original intent of the components of the narrative is not of concern here. 57 Beginning with v. 11 (perhaps even v. 10), the addressee is no longer Moses but Israel. At this point we begin to sense Deuteronomic phraseology, as noted by: Wellhausen (n. 29), p. 387; Kuenen (n. 23), p. 250 (?13, n. 32, 5e); Bacon (n. 16), p. 155 note; R.

However, my analysis has demonstrated that the festival calendar as well shows no evidence whatsoever of being an authentic, independent tradition. Thus this study should be taken as an attempt to lay to rest once and for all the entire theory that the covenant-renewal narrative of Exod. xxxiv contains an ancient legal document. Moreover, if this supposed collection of laws has hereto- fore been presumed to be the legal code of the Yahwistic source, the very existence of a J-document which contained its own law-code is now called into question. Indeed, the entire Sinai complex, and the literary composition of Exod. xxxiii-xxxiv in particular, will need to be re-evaluated in the light of the redactional nature of the laws in Exod. xxxiv. This study also has implications for the form-critical study of the passage, in particular, its relation to the covenant pattern as it has been identified elsewhere in the biblical literature and in the ancient Near East. Ever since the pioneering studies of G.E. Mendenhall, in which the formal similarities between the biblical berft and the Hittite treaties were first noted, form-critical study of the biblical covenant and its parallels has been a major branch of biblical research:58 V. Korosec was the first to identify the characteristic structural components of the Hittite treaties,59 and an attempt to demonstrate the presence of these elements in Exod. xxxiv was made in K. Baltzer's classic study of the covenant formula.60 Though his attempt was unconvincing, Baltzer 58 Law and Covenant in Israel and the Ancient Near East (Pittsburgh, 1955). Mention should also be made of an apparently forgotten study pre-dating those generally cited, H.M. Wiener, "Zur Deuteronomiumfrage", MG4' 72 (1928), pp. 24-48. Despite his rather fundamentalistic view of Deuteronomy, Wiener already identified some elements of the covenant-form in the Pentateuch by a legal-historical approach; see esp. pp. 28-34. 59 Hethitische Staatsvertrdge (Leipzig, 1931), pp. 12-4. 60 Das Bundesformular (Neukirchen, 1960), pp. 19-28, 48-51. His description included six components, though he admitted that the first (preamble) and the last two (the invocation of the gods as witnesses and the recitation of curses and blessings) are lacking in Exod. xxxiv. To be sure, the third component (the statement of substance con- cerning the future relationship) is also missing, but Baltzer argued that though it is not explicitly contained in Exod. xxxiv in its final form, it was present in the earlier text of vv. 1 la, 12-16 (despite stylistic pecularities). As for the second component (the antecedent history), Baltzer claims to have found it in vv. 10-1 lb; these verses, however, speak of the future. The all-important fourth component (the specific stipulations), of course, Baltzer located in vv. 17-26. Assertions similar to those made by Baltzer with regard to the presence of the covenant formulary in Exod. xxxiv were set forth independently by Beyerlin (n. 57), 186</page><page sequence="27">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS even went so far as to suggest that the text of Exod. xxxiv had its own independent existence prior to its having been inserted in the Sinai-narrative. Yet he failed to deal with the literary and text-critical issues, and did not take into account the parallel text in Exod. xxiii. His study is an example of a direction taken by scholarship in the latter half of the 20th century, as aptly pointed out by Toeg ([n. 55] p. 93): Historical speculation, particularly of the type that rests upon typological parallels from extra-biblical literature, can indeed greatly advance the investigation of various biblical issues. Today, however, we may discern a tendency to over-use such parallel material, while fundamental matters of literary and textual analysis are consciously or unconsciously overlooked. Toeg spelled out his opposition to the overuse of typological parallels particularly in regard to his study of the Sinai lawgiving tradition (p. 4): Thus, despite theoretical considerations regarding a possible set of con- nections between the various literary phenomena to be found in Exod. 19-24 and other factors of, for instance, a cultic or historical nature, there is a methodological justification, indeed, obligation, to concentrate almost exclusively on literary analysis. The more strictly discussion is confined to this area, the less likely it is to fall prey to the danger of leaving the facts behind and sailing off into the seas of pure speculation. For what is true of the biblical traditions concerning the lawgiving at Sinai is true of many other biblical passages: in the realm of facts there lies nothing but the four ells of the literary phenomenon. At least so far as the first stages of critical study and its point of departure are concerned, the literary and textual analysis must certainly precede the typological and comparative study.6' The preceding study of Exod. xxxiv has been an attempt to illustrate this principle by con- fining discussion to the laws which are regarded as the very substance of the covenant described by the narrative. Though no conclusions emerged which might rule out a possible connection between the covenant-form in Exod. xxxiv and the Hittite vassal treaties of the pp. 103-4, who proceeded from the comparative study of the covenant model to draw out literary-historical implications as well; see pp. 59ff. and Lohfink (n. 57), pp. 176-9; F.B.

McCarthy himself,63 foremost among scholars who assert the biblical covenant's dependence on ancient Near Eastern treaty patterns, was forced to admit that very little material for such comparison can be found in the Sinai complex of Exod. xix-xxiv. He acknowledged that literary patterns which reflect recurring circumstances in societal life may in point of fact be the result of independent developments taking place in different periods and locations, and that there is not neces- sarily any historical connection between the separate manifestations of a single phenomenon.64 Since, moreover, with regard to the passage studied here, it has become clear that the terms of the covenant in Exod. xxxiv reflect no authentic ancient tradition at all but are rather a late revision and redactional adaptation of earlier texts, it seems that any reconstruction of the purely hypothetical "covenant pattern" based on the form of the covenant in Exod. xxxiv would be unwarranted.65 One might well ask whether in such a case it is reasonable to assume any literary 62 The Aramaic Sefire treaties (see J.A. Fitzmyer, The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire [Rome, 1967]) and the Assyrian treaties, in particular the Neo-assyrian vassal treaties of Esarhaddon from 672 B.C.E. (see DJ. Wiseman, The Vassal Treaties of Esarhaddon [London, 1958]) serve as apt parallels for the Covenant at the Plains of Moab in Deuteronomy, not of the Sinai Covenant in Exodus. 63 Old Testament Covenant (Oxford, 1972), pp. 29-30; idem, (n. 3), pp. 152-67, 172-6; compare Weinfeld (n. 25), p. 66. 64 McCarthy (n. 63), p. 28. His earlier study adopted a more unequivocal stance regarding the historical continuity between the various Mesopotamian political treaties; see (n. 3), p. 80. The need to exercise caution when drawing historical implications from form-critical analysis (such as Mendenhall's "proof" that the Decalogue dates from the Mosaic period; see Mendenhall [n. 58], p. 28) can also be sensed in the sec- ond portion of Baltzer's study, where an attempt is made to uncover the Hittite vas- sal treaty form in the writings of the Qumran sect and in early Christian texts; see Baltzer (n. 60), pp. 103-83. 65 For reservations about the assumed connection between ancient vassal treaties and the biblical covenant between God and Israel, see E.W.

Further, in the light of this study, there remains no traditio-historical basis for asserting the antiquity of the covenant laws in Exod. xxxiv. The tradition-history approach is well illustrated in Beyerlin's study of the Sinai traditions ([n. 57] especially pp. 97-102), in which he sug- gested that the cultic regulations and festival calendar of Exod. xxxiv took shape in the Priestly circles of the Shiloh sanctuary. Beyerlin saw evidence for this theory in the expression "God of Israel" (xxxiv 23) which originated, in his view, in the traditions of Shechem and was later transferred, with the wanderings of the Ark of YHWH, to Shiloh (Gen. xxxiii 20; Josh. viii 30, xxiv 2; 1 Sam. i 17). He considered accepting the Samaritan reading 'm ("ark") in place of the Masoretic 'dn ("Lord") in v. 23, believing that this reading corroborated the view of Shiloh, where the Ark of YHWH stood during the period of the judges, as the place where the legislation developed. According to this hypothesis, this cultic and legal development took place during the conquest and settlement of Canaan, and was an Israelite reaction against the threat of total assimilation with Canaanite cultic practices. Drawing on ancient Near Eastern legal convention, Beyerlin went on to suggest that the ritual laws of Exod. xxxiv were originally drafted and preserved, in the form of an independent document, in the shrine at Shiloh. Only later would this document have been taken over as part of the literary work of the Yahwistic narrative. Though Beyerlin did not actually delve into the similarities between the festival calendar of Exod. xxxiv and that of Exod. xxiii, these did not go unnoticed. In his opinion, the most likely explanation for the similarities was that the two texts are separate recensions of a com- mon source,66 and he even goes so far as to posit that the cultic laws 66 As noted above, this is a widespread approach. See especially the following stud- ies, all of which speak of independent but parallel versions of written documents or oral traditions: L.B.

One is hard pressed to find evidence for all this in the biblical text; the impression gained is that a closer reading of the text and its biblical parallels would perhaps have led to more solid ground. In more recent decades, the debate over the attribution of the legal material in Exod. xxxiv to J has been renewed. Halbe,68 who has con- ducted a lengthy and detailed study of Exod. xxxiv 10-26, in which the text is closely examined, all the fundamental questions surround- ing it are examined anew, and the pre-literary source of the covenant tradition is sought, arrives in his own way, at the end of his literary- historical discussion, at the conclusion reached by classical criticism, namely, that the festival calendar is an authentic part of the Sinai tra- dition in the Yahwistic narrative. A perusal of subsequent studies shows, however, that Halbe was unsuccessful in his attempt to uproot the old scholarly tendency to discern Deuteronomic influence not only in the preamble (vv. 11-16; see the literature cited above)69 but even in the formulation of the laws (vv. 11-26). The latter view was always so mar- ginal that many scholars were unaware of it; from time to time it had to be rediscovered by scholars unconscious of its earlier adherents. It has lately been revived by Ginsberg, who considers vv. 10-27 to be a Deuteronomic interpolation.70 Taking another approach, Nicholson, fol- Ex 23, 10-33 und Ex 34, 10-26", BZ N.F. 15 (1971), p. 220; Haran (n. 36), p. 327; Wilms (n. 57), p. 187; Halbe (n. 23), pp. 449-50. 67 This was already suggested by Kittel ([n. 3] p. 493; but see also p. 494 n. 1). 68 (n. 17) pp. 11-526.

Although Ginsberg considers vv. 10-27 to be a Deu- teronomic interpolation, he reconstructs a "Ritual Decalogue" in Exod. xxxiv (on the history of research of this theory see the appendix at the end of the present article). Ginsberg designates the "decalogue" in Exod. xxxiv as "the Second Ritual Decalogue", thus distinguishing it from the "First Ritual Decalogue" which he sees in Exod. xxiii 190</page><page sequence="31">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS lowing Perlitt, has argued that vv. 10-27 were composed as an organic part of the calf episode of Exod. xxxii-xxxiv, and that no early J stra- tum can be detected at all.71 On the question whether this narrative was composed, as Perlitt had argued, by a Deuteronomic author of the Josianic period, or perhaps by a "proto-Deuteronomic" author at the time of Hezekiah, as supposed by Phillips and Zenger who view the substance of the covenant made in Exod. xxxiv as the basis for Hezekiah's reforms,72 Nicholson does not take a stand. Meanwhile, Johnstone73 has launched an attack on Hossfeld for identifying both J and JE ele- ments in Exod. xxxiv,74 an identification which Johnstone views as both "unconvincing and unnecessary", since, in his view, the festival calendar in Exod. xxxiv belongs not to theJE tradition but to the Deuteronomic Stratum ([n. 73] "Decalogue", p. 380). Similarly, E. Blum75 assigns vv. 11-27 to the "D-Komposition" in the chapter. Nor has the debate ended here. Of late, both Osumi and Crusemann have declared their allegiance to the classical view of the festival calendar in Exod. xxxiv as earlier than the parallel text in Exod. xxiii, while Levin maintains 10ff. (see pp. 46-7). It is the latter which is referred to, in his view, in Exod. xxxiv 28(!). Goldstein and Cooper adopt Ginsberg's approach, but they exchange Ginsberg's "post-Deuteronomic writer" ([n. 23] p. 46 n. 62) for a "proto-Deuteronomist", who they believe to have been a northern redactor responsible for combining J and E (RJE); see B.R.

Zenger (ed.), Der neue Bund im alten (Freiburg, 1993), p. 64. 73 See his recent series of articles advancing the claim that the Sinai narrative in Exod. xix-xl has undergone two redactions, one Deuteronomic and one Priestly: W.

Delcor (Paris, 1985), pp. 57-68, in whose view Exod. xxxiv 10-26 is based on aJ text which has undergone Deuteronomic redaction. 75 Studien zur Komposition des Pentateuch (BZAW 189) (Berlin, 1990), pp. 369-70. 191</page><page sequence="32">SHIMON BAR-ON the opposite-now, however, in accord with the more recent tendency to assign J to a relatively late period.76 I would not subscribe to the view held by the scholars mentioned above that the covenant in Exod. xxxiv is Deuteronomic in its entirety, nor would I, by the same token, assign the entire pericope to a Priestly writer.77 Since, as I have shown, both Deuteronomic and Priestly ele- ments can be detected, I have thought it best to attempt to deal with the manner in which the copying, revision and redaction has been carried out and to speak of the writer-reviser who has accomplished this task without affixing to him one of the conventional labels. I have proposed a dating of the revised festival calendar only in terms of its relation to other specific texts without reference to any of the four Pentateuchal documents (J, E, D and P) as a whole. My intention here is to convey my clear realization that none of the sources is a unified whole. In a majority of the studies mentioned, the relationship between the two festival calendars is treated in a broader context, such as the gen- eral question of redactional levels in the Sinai pericope or issue of the composition of the Torah as a whole. In such discussions, the detailed literary comparison of the two calendars cannot possibly receive the attention it requires. In the examination to which they have been subjected here, I have attempted to show that such a comparison- provided it is conducted prior to the literary-critical analysis, and in a manner unencumbered by existing scholarly hypothesis-can help to arrive at a more objective view. Accepted critical theories, such as the idea of a "ritual decalogue", have proven to be an obstacle in the path of unprejudiced comparison of the two texts, while the avoidance of such comparison, on the strength of the speculative supposition that the two texts originate, independently of each other, in a common third source turns out to be a case of missing the most important turn on a journey.78 As I believe the results of this study have shown, the very existence of two parallel texts should serve as the factual point of departure for critical appraisal, and the comparative textual analysis 76 Y.

Kratz too expresses the view that the literary dependence between the two texts must be acknowledged: "Der Dekalog im Exodusbuch", VT 44 (1994), p. 217. 192</page><page sequence="33">THE FESTIVAL CALENDARS is a reliable basis from which discussion of larger issues may proceed. Of course, the literary comparison must not be confined to form-critical matters of structure and overall style, nor can it restrict itself to tech- nical issues of the textual tradition and its transmission. Rather, in order to determine the significance of the differences between the two texts, the primary considerations which must be employed are exegetical. Appendix: The supposed antiquity of Exod. xxxiv 18-26 The assumption that the earliest kernel of Israel's calendar of sacred feasts is to be sought in the substratum of the text of Exod. xxxiv 18- 26 is held to be the case by most adherents of the theory that the festival calendar in Exod. xxxiv is part of a "ritual decalogue" (xxxiv 14-26), believed to be earlier than both the "ethical decalogue" (Exod. xx 1-17) and the Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx 22-xxiii 33). The "ritual decalogue" hypothesis took shape in the light of the view that the terms of the covenant made in Exod. xxxiv are identical with the "ten words" written on the two stone tablets (Exod. xxxiv 28). This understanding of the text is actually known from the writings of a 5th- century Alexandrian theologian; see E. Nestle, "Ein Vorganger Goethes uber den zweiten Dekalog", ZAW 24 (1904), pp. 134-5, and was revived in an anonymous essay by the young poet Goethe in 1773 ("Zwo wichtige bisher unerortete biblische Fragen, zum erstenmal griindlich beantwortet von einem Landgeistlichen in Schwaben", see Goethes Werke, Sanssouci-Ausgabe IX). Such attribution of greater antiquity to cultic law than ethical law is typical of the Graf-Wellhausenian view of the evolution of Israel's religion, and Wellhausen in fact adopted Goethe's suggestion; see Wellhausen (n. 18), pp. 84-5. (In this he was preceeded by Hitzig [n. 42], p. 42; E. Bertheau, Die sieben Gruppen mosaischer Gesetze in den drei mittleren Bichem des Pentateuchs [Gottingen, 1840], pp. 90-3, H. Ewald, Geschichte des Volkes Israel 2 [Gottingen, 18653], p. 238.) Wellhausen later defended the theory against Kuenen's attack (pp. 329- 35). The number of suggestions as to how one can locate a decalogue in this text is embarrasingly large; for a catalogue of 36 different attempts see Wilms (n. 57), pp. 200-6. This fact has not, however, deterred numerous scholars from embracing the theory of the "ritual decalogue". See, for instance, the commentaries of Holzinger, pp. 96, 119-20; Baentsch, pp. xlvi-xlvii; Beer-Galling, pp. 163-4; as well as: K.
