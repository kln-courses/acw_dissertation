<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COMPARISON OF ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART PLATES XIX-XXIII * A COMPARISON of Eskimo and Upper Palaeolithic art has been undertaken in this study. It forms part of an investigation of the general thesis that the modern Eskimo are the descendants by blood and culture of the cave men of Upper Palaeo- lithic Europe. This assertion is an old one and one which has been continually ap- pearing in the literature of European prehistory from the time when it was first uttered. It has gained a new interest through the researches of Dr. Paul Rivet of Paris and Professor Sollas of Oxford, while the recent work of Dr. Birket-Smith of Copenhagen reformulates the old problem in a new and what may prove to be a fruitful way. Further investigation of the question may not only lay a troublesome ghost, but may also lead to related problems of importance. The assertion that the Eskimo were descendants of the cave men rested upon evi- dence drawn from physical anthropology and ethnology. It would lie outside the limits of the present study to enter into the controversy over the racial affinities of Chancelade man. To investigate the possibility of a Palaeolithic basis of Eskimo culture would necessitate both a comparison of all similar types of specimens and a study of the distribution of those possessed in common, not only to determine the closeness of the possible relationship, but to see if the great gap in time and space might be bridged. Since the similarity between Eskimo and Palaeolithic art is one of the arguments most frequently advanced by those who postulate a connection be- tween the two peoples, we shall compare the two arts in some detail. The explana- tion of the similarities existing between the material culture of the Eskimo and that of the Upper Palaeolithic peoples of Europe constitutes a real problem. We should be prepared, however, to find certain likenesses due to a somewhat similar environ- ment. It is a question whether these resemblances are too great to be explained by fortuitous circumstances and must therefore argue a common origin of culture. The aim of the present study will be to find out what would constitute proof of a con- nection between Palaeolithic and Eskimo culture; and whether the art of the two peoples can furnish such a proof. Our conclusions in the field of art can not prove or disprove the theory of a connection until all possible similarities in material cul- ture have been compared. No matter what the final answer, our studies should cast some light on the more general problem of diffusion versus independent origin, inas- much as a large body of pertinent data will be collected. THE HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM The early works dealing with the problem fall into several divisions. The first discussions were characterized by dogmatic assertions based upon scanty ethnologi- cal material alone, that the Eskimo of today are the direct descendants of the cave men of France. Testut's publication on the Chancelade skull changed the nature of the problem by introducing anatomical material. Following him, there have been several works dealing almost exclusively with this new evidence, as well as *For list of illustrations, see pp. 509-511. 477 THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA</page><page sequence="2">478 FREDERICA DE LAGUNA more comprehensive researches containing all the available material. Later re- search has tended toward a more cautious statement of hypotheses, with a fuller description and enumeration of actual specimens and sources upon which the proof is based. The earliest supporters of the theory of a Magdalenian parentage for Eskimo man and his culture were superficial in their investigations, uncompromising in tone, and their writings scanty in documentation. However, the material to which they allude was probably better known to their contemporaries than to modern readers, since there was not at the time the vast accumulation of publications which now confronts us. A short sketch of the history of the problem and of the contributions of various writers on the subject will be useful for our study and informing in regard to the evo- lution of a scientific attitude toward the material. According to Sollas,1 Pruner Bey was the first scholar who attempted to identify the men of the Upper Palaeolithic with various Mongoloid races. He was criticised by Hamy for advancing theories without sufficient proof, although Hamy admitted some truth in his assertions.2 One of the earliest writers to introduce on an extended scale comparative ethnolog- ical material into the study of prehistory was Sir John Lubbock.3 His analogies were not limited to comparing a particular ancient culture with any particular modern one, and he certainly did not attempt any such identifications. The first to claim the Eskimo as the descendant of Magdalenian man was William Boyd Dawkins.4 His sources consisted of works by Lartet and Christy.' He also referred to the journals of the arctic explorers, Parry, Ross, and Lyon. It is inter- esting to know Dawkins' sources, for many who relied on his work never verified his statements, which are repeated over and over again with all the assurance of well- proven facts in the publications immediately following the first presentation of his theory. After briefly reviewing the discoveries at Les ]yzies and La Madeleine, Dawkins says:6 " The sum of evidence proves that man, in a hunter state, lived in the south of Gaul, on reindeer, musk-sheep, horses, oxen, and the like, at a time when the climate was similar to that which those animals now inhabit. To what race did he be- long? 7 In solving this, the zodlogical evidence is of great importance. The rein- deer and musk-sheep now inhabit the northern part of the American continent, and are the principal land animals that supply the Eskimo with food." These animals are known to have retreated further and further north during the historic period until the musk-ox completely disappeared from Europe. " May not the race that fed on these two animals in Southern Gaul have shared also in their northern re- treat, and may it not be living in company with them still? The truth of such an 'W. J.

The elements common to the two cultures mentioned by Dawkins are: the fowl- ing spear, harpoon, scraper, and marrow spoon, the habit of crushing bones for the marrow, and the lack of regard for the dead. Both peoples are of small bodily size.' The only difference between the cultures is the possession of the dog by the Eskimo, but a long enough time has elapsed to account for its adoption from some other peo- ple or for its domestication. As the climate of southern France became warmer at the end of the Palaeolithic period, "musk-sheep, reindeer, and Esquimaux would re- treat further and further north, until they found a resting place on the American shores of the great Arctic sea. Possibly, in the case of the Esquimaux the immigra- tion of other and better armed peoples might be a means of accelerating this move- ment." This hypothesis was given a more extended treatment in Cave Hunting, in 1874.2 Dawkins augmented his previous list of cultural types common to the Eskimo and Palaeolithic man.3 The elements in common are: the harpoon (the Palaeolithic forms differing only in their grooved barbs), heads of fowling and fishing spears, darts and arrows (with the same types of base for hafting), the shaft-straightener, scraper of stone in handle of ivory, stone lance head, sewing needle, and realistic art (except in so far as the hunting scenes depicted by the Palaeolithic artists were not familiar to the Eskimo).4 In conclusion he advanced the argument already quoted, pointing out that "there are no two savage tribes now living which use the same set of instruments without being connected by blood. . . . The conclusion, therefore, seems inevitable, that so far as we have any evidence of the race to which the dwell- ers in the Dordogne belong, that evidence points only in the direction of the Esqui- maux." Practically the same argument is made in his later work.6 Dawkins' point that similarities between two sets of culture elements make a stronger argument for a common origin than a similarity between isolated items is, of course, well taken. There remains, however, the question of fact. Further- more, it seems rash to attempt to prove racial affinity by ethnological material. Dawkins' theory did not pass unnoticed. Sir John Lubbock incorporated his views in a later edition of his work 7 and wrote a favorable review of Dawkins' posi- tion.8 Also, Charles E. Rance9 summarized some of Dawkins' arguments and added the suggestion that the European Arctic fauna and Palaeolithic man may have reached the New World during interglacial times by means of a land bridge from Siberia to America. In 1870, Hamy 10 followed Pruner Bey in assigning the races of Cro-Magnon and Furfooz to the group of hyperborean peoples. There is, of course, no question as 1 As proved by the finding at La Madeleine of poignards with handles so small that "they can only be grasped by three fingers of an ordinary-sized hand-a fact that indicates a small race of men." 2Dawkins, Cave Hunting, London, 1874.

As soon as they were found, every one except Dechelette admitted that they belonged to a different race from that of Cro-Mag- non, and an attempt was made to prove the affinity of this race with that of the Eskimo, while Cro-Magnon man was left out of the argument. According to Hamy, on the ethnological side we must turn to the Arctic peoples for analogies with Palaeolithic Europe. He first warns us against being misled by superficial and fortuitous similarities. The works of primitive man in stone are the same everywhere, and this is true of some simple bone implements. Only in the ex- treme north, among the Lapps, Eskimo, and Chukchi, do we find reproduced, "in all their details," the tools of stone and bone of the Upper Palaeolithic. The list of similar types includes: the "couteau a' soie" of the Ve'zere valley (?) which is the same implement as that used by the Eskimo, Chukchi and Lapps; the flint scraper, the awl (but he has already listed this among the simple tools of universal distribu- tion), the smoother (lissoir), "harpoon," bone point (already listed as of universal distribution), spatula, needle, dart point, etc., and style of art, particularly in the carving of animals, though in his opinion Eskimo art was decadent. A similarity of customs was also noted: in regard to the eating of marrow, boiling liquids with hot stones, (which may explain the presence of so many stones in the French caves!), making fire by friction, as at Les IEyzies (sic!) or by pyrites as at Chaleux, and the lack of regard for the dead. Hamy also called attention to the similarity between the Scandinavian stone age and the French Magdalenian, as proof that Palaeolithic man accompanied the reindeer in its migration to the north. Some of the circumpolar tribes are actually the descendants of Palaeolithic man, and "con- tinue in our own day in the circumpolar regions the age of the reindeer of France, Belgium, and Switzerland, with all its zodilogical and ethnographical characteristics."' Dupont2 accepted Boyd Dawkins' conclusions, and added a few items of resem- blance between the Eskimo and the cave man, though the lack of weapons suggestive of organized warfare is the only significant and valid point mentioned.3 Although published after the discovery of the skeletal remains so important in any consideration of this problem, the opinions of two French writers, Laloy and DI)chel- ette, and of one American, Hoffman, ought to be mentioned here because they deal only with the material known to Boyd Dawkins and do not consider Testut's arguments. Hoffman4and Laloy5 advanced arguments against Boyd Dawkins' theory. They seem to believe that a crossing from Europe to Greenland, via the British Isles, for which they rightly find no evidence, is necessarily involved in the "following-the- reindeer" theory. This was certainly not a part of Boyd Dawkins' thesis. They arbitrarily dismiss the possibility of a crossing via Bering Strait. The argument for a Palaeolithic basis of Eskimo art, resting on the similarity of realistic figures, can not be held, since, according to Hoffman, Eskimo pictographic representation is 10p. cit., pp. 357-367. 2 M.

Dechelette2 also attacked Dawkins' thesis, thereby exhibiting his reluctance to explain cultural phenomena by a movement of peoples. Thus, he denied any proof of migration during the whole course of the European Palaeolithic and Epipalaeo- lithic periods or even of the direct diffusion of a foreign culture into Europe during that time.3 Dechelette was unable to understand why Palaeolithic man should have preferred to follow the reindeer to the north when he could have hunted the stag and the wild boar, and when the climate in Europe was becoming so much more agreeable.4 Similarities between Eskimo and Palaeolithic culture he ascribed to a similarity in material life and natural environment. He also mentioned Hoffman's opinion that Eskimo art is recent. D&amp;chelette is open to criticism because of his extreme views, the more so since he made no allusion to the evidence which skeletal remains or the temporal and geo- graphic distribution of culture might give. He also erred in denying a migration because the motives for a migration to the north following the reindeer are not ap- parent. Sollas answered in part, at least, some of Dechelette's objections, and we know from the spread of Epipalaeolithic culture into Scandinavia after the retreat of the ice that movements of some sort did occur. Furthermore, D&amp;chelette no- where alluded to Testut's attempt to dissociate Chancelade man from that of Cro- Magnon and to connect him with the Eskimo. Last of all, an article by Lartet should be mentioned6 in which he discussed resem- blances between the Eskimo and the Lapps on the one hand and the cave men on the other in the matter of bone needles and their manufacture, the use of sinew thread, love of embroidery,' and the use of tooth pendants.s The studies were carried out in detail and include excellent illustrations and quotations from travelers in Lap- land and the American Arctic. These comparisons were intended only as analogies, not to prove a relationship. The writers discussed above made practically no use at all of skeletal material and such material as has been mentioned is not that on which later arguments were based. Yet these writers have attempted to prove an identity of race between the Eskimo and Palaeolithic man because of a claimed identity of culture. The validity of such a proof is not evident. There has also been the assumption that Upper Palaeolithic man must have been related to some living race, and that to point out the race he most closely resembles is to prove an identity. The alternative, that Palaeolithic man may have become extinct without leaving any direct descendants 1 Mathiassen's discovery of realistic art in the ancient Thule phase of Eskimo culture, of course dis- proves this statement. 2 J.

We have already remarked upon this un- conscious assumption underlying Boyd Dawkins' first statement of his thesis and we are to meet it again in the writings of Testut and Sollas. There is a similar criticism to be made of the attempt to prove an identity of culture. If we examine the actual material types, Eskimo and Palaeolithic, said to show an absolute identity in every detail, we shall see with what little critical judg- ment these claims have been made. Dupont, Dawkins, Hamy, and more recent in- vestigators alternate between the notion that Eskimo culture shows analogies useful in explaining Palaeolithic remains, and the notion that these analogies constitute real similarities, proving a common cultural tradition. The confusion of these two points of view constitutes an essential weakness in the treatment of the problem. It is to be explained by the spirit in which archaeologists have approached their task of interpreting Palaeolithic remains which have survived to us, sadly altered by the vicissitudes of time and isolated from the body of culture which alone could render them intelligible. The comparative method, as proposed by Lubbock, offered the best solution. It brought to light many analogies between the culture of the Eskimo and those of Upper Palaeolithic Europe, which archaeologists have ex- ploited to the full, exaggerating both the number and closeness of the similarities. Not having to deal with differences, they tended to ignore their existence. More- over, they have failed to perceive that an analogy sufficiently striking to suggest a plausible interpretation may not be close enough to prove connection. Further- more, it has become a habit, as we can see from the writings of Breuil,1 Rivet,2 Saint- Perier,3 etc., to turn first to the Eskimo when seeking an explanation of a Palaeo- lithic object. This furnishes plenty of analogies, but at the same time makes for a greater possibility of error than if the problematic objects had been compared im- partially to a wide range of corresponding forms. On the other hand, the eth- nologists have not had the same interest in establishing affinities between Palaeo- lithic and modern cultures and have usually dismissed the possibility as fantastic. Testut's monograph cast an entirely new light on the old problem, for in the re- mains of Chancelade, Testut claimed to have found a new race, differing from that of Cro-Magnon,4 and exhibiting the anatomical characteristics of the Eskimo. The Chancelade skeleton had been buried in a flexed position, and true to the old tradi- 1 Breuil, "Notes de voyage paleolithique en Europe centrale," part II, L'Anthropologie, XXXIV, Paris, 1924, p. 532, compares fig. 532 from Predmost with the "bag-handles" of the Eskimo. In Breuil and Saint-Perier, Les Poissons, etc. darts l'art quaternaire, Memoire 2, Archives de l'Institut de Paleontologie humaine, Paris, 1927, p. 81, footnote, he compares the little bifid points of the upper Magdalenian with the bird arrows of the Eskimo and other peoples. 2 Rivet, "Interpretation ethnographique de deux objets prehistoriques," Congres International des Americanistes, XI Session, Part II, Gdteborg, 1925, pp. 203-206, compares the feline figure from Is- turitz with the Eskimo ajagaq. 3 Saint-Perier, "La Grotte de Goueris a Lespugue," L'Anthropologie, XXXVII, Paris, 1927, com- pares a segment of a bone ring from Lespugue, fig. 17-1, with the head of an Eskimo comb, and per- forated ivory plates from Mas d'Azil, fig. 18-2 and -3, with Eskimo belt buckles. In "Engins de P&amp;che palkolithiques," L'Anthropologie, XXXVIII, Paris, 1928, he compares, pp. 20-21, Palaeolithic specimens with Eskimo fish needles, and Eskimo salmon decoys. 4 Cro-Magnon man, according to Testut, is a cross between Chancelade man and the invading Neo- lithic race: L. Testut, Recherches anthropologiques sur le skelette quaternaire de Chancelade (Dordogne), Lyon, 1889, p. 115; however, cf. M. Boule, Les Hommesfossiles,2 Paris, 1923, pp. 285-293.</page><page sequence="7">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 483 tion, Testut compared this with Eskimo burials, though he found his analogy, not as did Dawkins and the others, in the lack of proper respect for the dead, but in the manner of burial., Testut made a complete study of the skeletal remains, at every point comparing the measurements and striking characteristics with those of other races, both living and extinct. This otherwise careful work was rendered somewhat less valuable be- cause the skull had to be reconstructed from fragments, and was incomplete in several important parts. Furthermore, Testut did not tell from what sources he obtained the figures about other races which he used in his comparison. This is an unfortunate omission, for we should like to know whether the methods by which they were obtained and compiled are comparable to those employed by Testut on the Chancelade remains. Testut states in conclusion: " Parmi les races actuelles, celle qui me parait presenter la plus grande analogie avec l'homme de Chancelade est celle des Esquimaux." They have the same skull, the same type of face, the same height, the same nasal and orbital indices, the same degree of torsion of the humerus. He mentions the "fol- lowing-the-reindeer" theory, and adds: "La decouverte de Chancelade, en mettant en lumitre une analogie frappante entre le squelette de notre troglodyte p&amp;rigourdin et celui des Esquimaux actuels, apporte a cette opinion, aussi sdduisante que naturelle, I'appui de l'anthropologie anatomique, qui, dans l'espece, a une importance capitale."2 Testut's work, in particular his estimation of the cranial capacity of the Chance- lade skull, has received considerable criticism. Sollas,3 however, after comparing it with the Greenland skulls published by Furst and Hansen 4 heartily indorses Testut's conclusions. Sollas sums up 28 points of resemblance between Chancelade man and the Eskimo, and finds only 5 doubtful or differing characteristics. "It has been objected-and no doubt with justice-that there is a great danger in forming a judgment on the evidence of a single skull. 'Unus est nullus'-it is said. But there is no universal rule, and in the present instance we are dealing with a skull of very distinctive characters, and with the Eskimo, a race of equally distinctive charac- ters.5 . . . I think it will be generally admitted, on reviewing the evidence that the assemblage of characters presented on the one hand by the Chancelade skull, and on the other hand by the Eskimo, are in very remarkable agreement, and that the onus of discovering a similar assemblage, but possessed by some other race, rests with those who refuse to accept what seems to be a very obvious conclusion." He does not here admit of a third possibility, namely, that the similarities observed, however striking, are not sufficient to prove a relationship and that there may be no race living today which is closely related to that of Chancelade. He attempts to answer objections by pointing out that "the bones of Chancelade, however, re- semble those of the existing Eskimo, as closely as those of the French musk ox re- semble those of the Greenland musk ox; and are not separated in space by so wide an interval."6 Sollas here argues for the "following-the-reindeer" theory.7 1 Op. cit., pp. 3-4. 2 Testut, p. 117.

After comparing the du Roc skulls with those of various races, living and fossil, he concludes that the du Roc group belongs to the same race as Chancelade man, for whom Testut established a striking comparison with the Eskimo. In any case, he felt that one could not deny the Mongolian affinities of this race.' However, even with the du Roc skulls, is there sufficient material to establish the racial type of Chancelade? And are the similarities between this type and the Eskimo sufficient to prove a relationship notwithstanding the great separation in space and time? It has often been asserted by Boyd Dawkins and his successors that the distribu- tion of animal species common to the European Pleistocene and the present fauna of Arctic North America offers a strong argument by analogy in support of the "follow- ing-the-reindeer" theory. We must call attention to the fact that at best the evi- dence shows only that man might have followed these animals into the New World, not that he did so. The picturesque consideration that the same animals furnished food and tool materials to both prehistoric man and the modern Eskimo adds noth- ing. Dawkins and Hamy seem to imply that the musk ox and caribou of the New World are the actual offspring of the same herds which roamed Europe during the Ice Age. Moreover, for Chancelade man and the Eskimo a closer relationship has been claimed than that proved for these animals, i.e., a racial affinity, over and above the participation in a common species. As a matter of fact, not all the American Arctic and European Pleistocene animals mentioned in this connection have as close a relationship as that of the same species.2 The "following-the-reindeer" theory definitely specifies a post-Pleistocene immigration of the original Eskimo into the American continent. However, most of the animals of the American Arctic crossed to the New World before the close of the Pleistocene, in many cases much earlier, so that, if man accompanied them, he must have done so at a much earlier date than that assumed by the theory.3 In Ancient Hunters and their Modern Representatives, Sollas makes the most com- plete case in favor of Boyd Dawkins' thesis, though the skeletal evidence is given in more detail in his more recent article on the Chancelade skull. On the ethnological side, Sollas enumerates 11 main points of resemblance: the 1 H.

Boule, in Les Hommes Fossiles, p. /299, supports Testut's identification of Chancelade man with the Eskimo. 2The cave bear, ursus spelaeus, which became extinct during the Pleistocene, is related to the American grizzly, and to the brown bear of northern Europe and Asia, though none of these are classed within the same species. (Max Weber, Die Sdugetiere, Jena, 1904, p. 535.) Though there is only one species of reindeer, the European Pleistocene form belongs to the same sub- group as that of Lapland, while the various other sub-groups of American caribou are distinct. (H. F. Osborn, Men of The Old Stone Age,2 New York, 1916, p. 209; Andrew Murray, The Geographical Distribution of Mammals, London, 1866, pp. 151-159). The musk-ox of the European Pleistocene and the American Arctic are classed within the same species. (Weber, op. cit., pp. 680, 725.) 3 The evidence for Pleistocene man in North America is not yet definite enough to shed any light on the problem of Eskimo origins.</page><page sequence="9">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 485 shaft-straightener, bone arrowhead with ownership marks, hairpin, ivory pendant, snow scraper, bone needle (though he lays no stress on this because of its wide dis- tribution), hollow bone needlecase, wound pin and plug,' ivory smoother, barbed bone spearheads, spear thrower (though he mentions that this is widely distributed and the shape of the Magdalenian form is quite different from that of the Eskimo), and art.2 Minor resemblances to which Sollas alludes in passing, but does not men- tion in his conclusion are: the gorge,3 stone implements from Greenland which are upper Palaeolithic in character without belonging to any definite type,4 the stone lamp,5 and the bow drill.6 He admits that some of the most important and character- istic implements of the Eskimo are lacking in Magdalenian culture: the sledge,' the kayak, and the fully developed (toggle-head) harpoon. However these are spe- cialized types that we should hardly expect to find in the Palaeolithic.8 To this "prima facie case in favor of an alliance by culture" Sollas would add racial identity, indicated by Testut's work. The Chancelade skeleton is that of "a veritable Eskimo, who lived in southern Gaul during the Magdalenian age."' The Magdalenian peoples emigrated towards the north owing to pressure exerted by Neolithic peoples and to the withdrawal of the sub-arctic fauna upon which the Magdalenian hunters depended. Proof of a shifting of population is afforded by the discovery of several Magdalenian stations in regions formerly glaciated.1o Sollas here states that a connection between Magdalenian Man and the Eskimo does not necessarily involve the "following-the-reindeer " theory, and though at- tractive it is not supported by facts." The hypothesis he here advances is as follows: "During the Magdalenian age at least two races of dolichocephalic Leiotrichi, differing greatly in stature, extended from Western Europe to the east, across the entire breadth of Asia, occupying a zone which included much of the tundra and the steppes. They possessed a common Magdalenian culture, and resembled in their mode of life the Algonkians and Athapascans of the tundra as they existed before the advent of the white man, feeding on reindeer and the mammouth, horse, and bison, together with various kinds of fish." The taller race lived to the south, while the shorter race was forced to the north and so came to develop a special kind of culture.

A movement of the Leiotrichi was thus set up towards the north; but as there was no room for expansion in that direction, it was diverted towards the only possible egress, and an outflow took place into America over Bering Strait or the Aleutian Islands. The primitive Eskimo, already accustomed to a boreal life, extended along the coast." The other peoples came in behind and gradually spread over the whole of the New World.' It is difficult to criticise this theory because it does not seem to follow directly from the evidence and arguments which Sollas has previously presented in his work. Though Upper Palaeolithic sites have been discovered in Russia and Si- beria, the culture of these eastern stations apparently differs considerably from the European Upper Palaeolithic cultures.2 Unfortunately, in this country we do not yet have access to the results-of recent excavations in Siberia, though a comparison of Siberian Upper Palaeolithic types with those of the Eskimo is of the highest importance for our problem. According to Sollas, comparison should be made between the Upper Palaeolithic of Siberia and the Algonkian and Athabaskan Indian, not between the Palaeolithic of Western Europe and the Eskimo. This theory approaches those of Hatt, Hallowell, and Birket-Smith, except that Sollas believes that the differentiation of the Eskimo culture out of the common pre- Eskimo-Indian background took place in the Old World rather than in the New. Sollas' hypothesis is of value because he shows that what we have here is only the fragment of a much larger problem, involving the culture history of Siberia and North America and the peopling of the New World. Dr. Paul Rivet has also considered this problem, but he has published little more than a statement of a hypothesis to explain similarities between the Upper Palaeo- lithic cultures and those of Arctic Europe, Asia, and the Eskimo, and a short paper comparing some Palaeolithic objects with the Eskimo ajagaq. Among the cultural types he considers common to the Eskimo and the Palaeolithic are: the throwing- stick, shaft-straightener, barbed "harpoon," snow knife,3 ajagaq (or cup-and-ball game), and art.4 The hypothesis which he advances to explain these similarities is as follows: "On peut supposer que les peuples ouralo-altaiques ont eu pour centre de dispersion quelque region situde " l'est de la Caspienne et que de la est parti un premier essaim vers le nord de l'Europe occidentale de's le quaternaire, un second essaim vers le nord, repre- sente par les Finnois, les Lapons, et les Samoyedes, et enfin un troisieme essaim vers l'est, par les regions circumpolaires, dont les Eskimos sont les representants les plus 1 Sollas, 1924, p. 596. 2 It has hitherto been believed (MacCurdy, Human Origins, New York, 1924, I, p. 439, and p. 206, and Von Merhart, "The Paleolithic Period in Siberia, etc." trans. by G. G. MacCurdy, American Anthropologist, N. S. XXV, 1923, p. 21-25) that the Siberian Upper Palaeolithic was lacking in art. In the last few years, however, remarkable discoveries of art objects have been made, and I only regret that I am not able to make use of that material in this paper. 3 The presence of the snow knife in the Palaeolithic seems to me very doubtful. Some of the large spatulas of Le Placard, for example, might have been suitable for such a purpose, but there is nothing to indicate that they were intended for that rather than for scraping skins, etc. 4 Rivet, "Interpretation Ethnographique, etc." p. 265, and "Les Origines de l'homme Americain," L'Anthropologie, XXXV, Paris, 1925, p. 297.</page><page sequence="11">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 487 orientaux." This last migration could not have taken place before the end of the Palaeolithic.1 This hypothesis has the virtue of bringing all the circumpolar peoples into the problem, but so definite a theory seems premature since we know so little about the archaeology of Siberia. A REFORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM Up to this point the writers considered have not used Eskimo archaeological ma- terial. This is because until very recently there has been no available body of material to consult, with only at best isolated collections of Eskimo antiquities of uncertain provenience, inadequate for any systematic conception of the development of Eskimo culture. On the other hand, there have been several attempts to dis- cover the origin of Eskimo culture by rationalistic deduction, either through an analysis of the culture itself, as in the work of Steensby, or through a study of the distribution of Eskimo traits outside the Eskimo area as in the writings of Hatt and Thalbitzer. The influence of these authors has left its mark upon their successors, Mathiassen and Birket-Smith. The attitude of the average ethnologist to Boyd Dawkins' thesis is illustrated by Steensby's criticism.2 What similarities exist between the two cultures he ascribes to common tool-materials and similar environment, pointing out that the toggle harpoon heads, typical of the Eskimo, have never been found in a Palaeolithic de- posit.3 Sollas had also mentioned this fact, but for him it did not present a fatal obstacle to his theory. This is because the two have something quite different in mind when writing of "Eskimo culture." While Sollas would not deny the recent origin of many Eskimo traits, he, like other archaeologists, has rather tended to ignore these latter phases. Steensby, however, is interested in the finer distinctions which set Eskimo culture apart as uniquely "Eskimo" and which differentiate it from every other, that of the adjacent Indians in particular. European archaeolo- gists have not been interested in these distinctions but have sought to emphasize those points of resemblance by which the Eskimo and the Upper Palaeolithic might be included in a common scheme. They have erred in not distinguishing between what the Eskimo share with other peoples and what appears to be exclusively their own. Yet this distinction is of the highest importance, since it is only for those widely distributed traits that we can expect to find Palaeolithic origin. The purely Eskimo traits, on the other hand, must be considered of local origin. It is only in respect to the "non-Eskimo" traits that the Eskimo can be Palaeolithic. It is hardly necessary to say much about Steensby's theory since it has been re- cently summarized by both Mathiassen and Birket-Smith, whose own theories have superseded it,4 Steensby believed that Eskimo culture developed out of an Indian background. The pre-Eskimo, speaking the mother tongue of the present Eskimo language, lived in an area between the Barren Grounds and the prairies. Even 1 Op. cit., 1925, p. 296. 2H. P.

The most "typical" Eskimo culture is the Arctic form, which is, therefore, the oldest, the sub-Arctic forms being derivations.2 The region most "suitable" for the development of this Arctic Es- kimo culture from the original Indian mode of life is the Arctic Archipelago of Canada, and in particular the region about Coronation Bay, so that it is there that we must look for the home of Eskimo culture.3 This Arctic or "Palae-Eskimo" phase of culture was really an inland culture, the sub-Arctic or coastal aspects did not develop until the culture spread into other regions and felt the influence of other cultures, particularly the Asiatic cultures at Bering Strait, where a later "Neo- Eskimo" phase developed, characterized by borrowings from Asia.4 It is this cul- ture sequence which we meet again in Birket-Smith's thesis. Steensby's use of the criteria of "typicalness" and "suitableness" is very danger- ous, since they depend so much upon individual judgment, and the possibility of error, where there is no archaeological material as a check, is very great. Steensby has attempted to discover the origin of various elements of Eskimo cul- ture. Unfortunately except for the throwing-board, which he believes to be a local Eskimo invention,j and the lamp which he thinks was not though he fails to state its place of origin,6 he does not discuss those objects capable of being preserved, and of which we could consequently hope to find traces in the Palaeolithic. A long list of elements common to the Eskimo and the tribes of Arctic and sub- Arctic Siberia and Europe has been published by Thalbitzer.7 This study is in the nature of a bibliography rather than a finished work; the only conclusion drawn is that the resemblances may point to an original geographic community or even a common origin of circumpolar cultures.8 The Danish scholar Hatt in his monograph on moccasins 9 has distinguished two types of clothing, each associated with a corresponding type of culture, the younger of which originated in the area of the Tungusian tribes, or a little to the south, and now enjoys the wider distribution. With it was associated the snow-shoe. "If this theory be correct, we shall then have to reckon with two large culture waves, which in prehistoric times swept over the northern regions. The oldest of these, now most fully developed in the culture of the Eskimo tribes, did not have snow-shoes and therefore could not conquer the vast inland areas; it must have followed and taken possession of the rivers and coasts, and we would call this first great wave the coast cul- ture. The younger culture wave is found fullest and unmixed in the culture of the Tungusians, although its influence is felt from Lapland to Labrador: it still has the character of an inland culture and must have originated as such. Its most valuable possession is the snow-shoe which has carried it over the greater part of the arctic."1o 1 Steensby, p. 205. 2 Op. cit., p. 170. 3 Op. cit., p. 168. 4 Op. cit., p. 166. 6 Op. cit., p. 162. 6 Op. cit., p. 202. 7 W.

As Mathiassen has pointed out,2 Hatt, by placing the coast culture as the earliest phase, inverts the order Steensby tried to establish. Hatt believes that this original coast culture was related to the Palae-Asiatic cultures of northeastern Asia, and possessed the umiak, fish-net, gut-skin shirt, urine tanning, square house, etc., and also a part of the elements found among all Eskimo tribes. The wave of inland culture brought the kayak, and because of this valuable invention was able to sweep over the whole Eskimo area, which accounts for the uniformity of the Eskimo language. Mathiassen considers this theory in the main correct, since it is supported by the discovery of the markedly coastal Thule culture as the oldest culture in the Central regions. However, the kayak was not introduced by the modern, inland culture, but belonged to the Thule phase.3 Systematically excavated archaeological material which has long been needed is provided for us in Mathiassen's 4 classic monograph on the archaeology of the Cen- tral Eskimo. No future study of the problem can afford to neglect this contribution. The Thule culture, i.e. the original "coastal" culture in the Central regions, is the oldest in northeastern Canada and in Greenland of which we have any archaeologi- cal record. Mathiassen believes that it originated in Alaska or in northeastern Siberia, because the types or prototypes of certain characteristic implements of the Thule culture are found in the west, and because anthropogeographical consid- erations point to Alaska as a suitable place of origin since it possesses ice for the development of ice-hunting, wood for the building of umiaks, and large sea mam- mals which were incentives to whaling.5 Unfortunately the archaeology of Alaska has not been sufficiently explored, especially on the north coast, for us to be certain about the place of origin of the Thule culture. Hence it is impossible to say what relationship the Thule culture of the east bears to the archaeological Alaskan cul- tures, the so-called Old Bering Sea and the Punuk, and how these are all related to the original Eskimo culture. It is hoped that the present investigations conducted at Point Barrow by the U. S. National Museum will solve some of these problems. In the meantime it is certain that some of the Thule types now found in Alaska are recent there, at least in the region about Bering Strait,-and were introduced from the east by a backwash of Thule culture into Alaska in very recent times.6 How- ever, it is also fairly certain that at an early date there was a Thule or a related phase at Point Barrow, represented by the Van Valin 7 and Hobson collections in the University Museum, Philadelphia, but only further excavation can determine the exact position of this culture. Birket-Smith carries on the traditions of Steensby and Hatt, although his studies 1 "Kyst- og Inlandskultur i det arktiske," Geografisk Tidsskrift, XXIII, Copenhagen, 1916. 2 Mathiassen, 1927, II, p. 198. 3 Ibid., p. 200. 4 T.

He follows Steensby's general scheme of the history of Eskimo culture. The Palae-Eskimo, or original inland culture, is represented today by the Caribou Eskimo, the Neo-Eskimo phase by the Thule culture. Birket-Smith accepts Hatt's theory of two great culture waves in northern Eurasia and North America, but finds Hatt's terminology misleading and would substitute "ice-hunting" and "snow-shoe" for the terms "coast" and " in- land" cultures.' The Caribou Eskimo should be considered the most primitive and conservative survivors of the ice-hunting culture. The second volume of Birket-Smith's work is largely devoted to the elements of this culture, and to the position of the Caribou Eskimo within it. Perhaps the fullest picture of the "snow- shoe" phase is to be found in Hallowell's study of the bear cult in northern Eurasia and North America. By the expression "ice-hunting culture" Birket-Smith does not want to imply that it was absolutely homogeneous throughout its entire area. The term "is merely an abstraction, an expression meaning that a certain common basis must be assumed to lie under the building up of the culture everywhere in the circumpolar region."2 Unfortunately Mathiassen and Birket-Smith have left us two very different pic- tures, and as yet no way has been found to reconcile their opinions.' However, they agree on a point of the greatest importance for our problem, viz., that the origi- nal Eskimo culture contained many Asiatic elements. Birket-Smith has suggested a way in which the problem of a Palaeolithic origin of Eskimo culture can be restated. The comparison should be made between the Palaeolithic and the "ice-hunting" culture as a whole, not with the Eskimo alone. He also believes in the possibility of such a connection, suggesting that the connect- ing links are to be sought in the Scandinavian Neolithic. The stone ages of Scan- dinavia, and even the Lapp Iron Age carry on traditions established in the Palaeo- lithic.4 The modern culture of the Lapps, as Thalbitzer, Birket-Smith, and others have shown, contains a substratum which makes it one among the related circum- polar cultures. In this way the enormous gaps of space and time may be filled to a certain extent, and a connection between the Upper Palaeolithic and the Es- kimo can no longer be argued on similarities between those two cultures alone. A related chain of similarities must be exhibited, with a continuity of tradition. But at present such an ideal argument is impossible. However, it is not at all certain that we shall be able to establish a connection in the way Eirket-Smith has outlined. It is not easy to trace Palaeolithic traditions in the Scandinavian Neolithic.' At first glance the series: Magdalenian-Magle- mosian (or Mullerup)--Arctic Stone Age--Lapp Iron Age, appears as a chain of 1 Birket-Smith, 1929, II, p. 114. 2 Ibid., p. 216. 3 See the discussion between Mathiassen and Birket-Smith in the American Anthropologist on the origin of Eskimo culture. n.s.

Even though the chain of Palaeolithic in- fluences were unbroken, we should still have to satisfy ourselves that they were embodied in those cultural types shown to have a wide distribution from Lapland to the American Arctic, if we are to prove that Eskimo culture can be traced back to the Palaeolithic over this route. Unfortunately the resemblances to Eskimo cul- ture do not increase as we advance along this suggested sequence; in some respects the Magdalenian seems closest to the Eskimo, in others the Maglemosian, and in still others the Lapp Iron Age. Yet this last culture is too late to represent a direct link in the chain; at best it can be a stage parallel to that which saw the invention of the toggle-head harpoon in the original Eskimo or proto-Eskimo culture, with an art style, which though apparently local, suggests some similarities with that of the Punuk culture in Alaska. However, if, as I believe, it is only in Siberia, if anywhere, that we can hope to find a Palaeolithic-Neolithic culture sequence from which Es- kimo culture is derived, the Scandinavian stone age can not tell us much of that development. It would reflect only faint traces of those culture waves which might reach the western limit of the circumpolar area. As a matter of fact, the Neolithic culture which bears the closest resemblance to the Eskimo is that of Japan,' and since no Palaeolithic has been found there, it is difficult to see what this may mean for our problem. At best the theory of the inheritance by the Eskimo of Palaeolithic culture via the Scandinavian Neolithic can be proved only by a study of particular cultural types, for most of which Birket-Smith has traced a wide distribution throughout northern Eurasia and elsewhere, and to these, others might possibly be added. The list would include: the stone lamp, sewing-needle, bone needle-case, barbed bone points with tang (not with socket), both fixed and detachable, chipped flint end- scraper, gorge, fish-lure, fish-needle, shaft-straightener, bone spoon, marrow ex- tractor, bone awl, throwing-stick, pendant, bead, button with perforated shank, etc. To use these elements in any proof it would first be necessary to show that the identi- fication of the Palaeolithic specimens involved is correct. To these, the Magle- mosian or an analogous culture stage in the east may have contributed: the bone comb, barbed fish hook, etc. However, these are all extremely simple types of wide distribution, so that to be sure of dealing with the same element and not with sim- ilar objects of independent origins, it would be necessary to demonstrate the con- stancy of some distinguishing stylistic trait in each case, or perhaps the associated occurrence of a complex of elements. It seems doubtful if any connection between the Palaeolithic and the Eskimo can be limited to even a circumpolar culture area. Again and again Birket-Smith finds a trait common to the "ice-hunting " cultures in South America, too, or even in Oceania; and this, I suspect, will also hold for any of the Palaeolithic elements we may include in the comparison. Some traits which Birket-Smith has discussed appear to be so simple and satisfy such inevitable human wants that we wonder if they are significant in a distribution study, especially when its scope precludes the taking into account of stylistic features. This difficulty would also apply to many IG. N. Munro, Prehistoric Japan, Yokohama, 1911.</page><page sequence="16">491 FREDERICA DE LAGUNA of the elements common to Eskimo and Upper Palaeolithic cultures. These con- siderations make us doubt whether a connection between the Eskimo and the Upper Palaeolithic would depend on anything stronger than those bonds of common human culture which unite all peoples, due either to an inheritance from remote antiquity, or to such simple parallelisms as may arise anywhere under similar conditions. The resemblances would then be explained by the fact that the Eskimo remained in a simple stage of culture where these elements are comparatively conspicuous, while a similar natural environment has favored accidental and superficial similarities. Or, it may be that the Eskimo have actually retained an important share of the Palaeolithic substructure which sets them apart among all other peoples. In any case, we have passed far beyond the original thesis of Boyd Dawkins. REPRESENTATIVE ART In support of a Palaeolithic origin for Eskimo culture a similarity in art, particu- larly in the case of animal representations, has been cited as one of the strongest arguments. If this similarity is due to nothing more than an attempt on the part of both peoples to portray men and animals realistically we may dismiss the argu- ment as of little worth. It will be necessary to show that the style of representation is the same, and that there is some archaeological or ethnological evidence to sug- gest the possibility of a connection. The age of Eskimo realistic art is, of course, of primary importance. Though Hoffman's theory that all Eskimo realistic incised art was due to Russian influence has been disproved, the age of incised representations of men and animals in Alaska is still unknown, our archaeological examples being of uncertain age. Mathiassen ascribes realistic etchings to the hypothetical first stage of the Thule culture in Alaska, but according to Collins this form of art originated in the Canadian Thule culture, being carried to Alaska by a late wave of migration, since such etchings have not been found in the sites of the Old Bering Sea or the Punuk cultures.2 Representations of animals in the round, however, are known from all the archaeolog- ical Eskimo cultures,-the Old Bering Sea, Punuk, and Canadian Thule cultures,- and from archaeological sites in northern Alaska. The human figure in the round, on the other hand, is not known from the Old Bering Sea culture, though its ab- sence, in view of the scantiness of our collections can not be taken as very significant. Though the realistic art of the two peoples is really very different, as I think I shall be able to prove, an argument might be based upon purely geometric decora- tions, motifs composed of straight lines for the most part. The geometric art of the Upper Palaeolithic has received very little attention because it is less conspicuous than the representations of animals, and also because too often the patterns have been explained as degenerate animal or human figures. In comparing the non-represen- tative art of the Eskimo and Upper Palaeolithic cultures, we must proceed with cau- tion, for the elements are so simple that they might possibly be bound up with the technique of working bone with stone tools; that is, they might arise spontaneously from any attempt to decorate bone objects with straight-line patterns. To prove a genetic connection, will it be enough to show that the same decorative elements 'Mathiassen, 1930, p. 802. 2 Collins, 1909, p. 44.</page><page sequence="17">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 493 occur in both arts, or must we also show them to be executed by the same technical means? Do they occur too often to be fortuitous? Are they used in the same way, for the same decorative effects, entering into the same types of composition and fill- ing relatively the same place in the two art styles? Certainly the argument would gain weight if these designs, though simple, were really limited in distribution, say, to the circumpolar area. However, I think it is impossible to prove this; the de- sign elements appear sporadically in every part of the world wherever there is a style of incised decoration, unsophisticated enough for simple straight-line patterns to find a place. But to investigate the distribution of these simple patterns would be a task far beyond the limits of the present study. No argument, therefore, which relied upon these simple elements alone could attempt to prove more than the participation in a common aesthetic background, with the alternative theory of parallelism unanswerable. We shall content ourselves with an analysis of the two arts, trying to discover what evidence might be found in a comparison of the com- plete repertory of the simple design elements, and in their stylistic functions. In this study I have tried to use the archaeological Eskimo material as far as possible, and thus have perhaps appeared to slight modern Eskimo art. Unfortu- nately the archaeological specimens most exactly datable come from what we must consider a peripheral region when discussing connections with Asia; they belong to the Thule culture of Canada and Greenland. The oldest of these finds dates back perhaps a thousand years. Mathiassen has argued that the art of the Thule culture of Canada appears to be a degenerate form of an older art in the west; but from Arctic Alaska and northeastern Siberia, where presumably the Thule culture and its art originated, we lack properly excavated specimens, and must content ourselves with purely modern or with archaeological material about the age of which we can say very little. Possibly some of these, perhaps a considerable portion, are the re- sult of that western spread of the Thule culture in recent times which I have already mentioned. In the region about Bering Strait, the oldest culture is the so-called Old Bering Sea culture, but its art is so highly evolved and so very individual in character that we shall omit it from our comparison. Collins believes that future excavation will prove the Old Bering Sea culture to be the parent of the Thule cul- ture,1 but in spite of its great antiquity in Alaska, in my opinion it is too specialized to be the original Eskimo culture which must be much more generalized, at least in art style. On St. Lawrence Island Collins has found a succession of sites showing the development of the Old Bering Sea culture into its most typical forms and its subsequent change into something intermediate between the Old Bering Sea and the modern Alaskan culture, a phase he has called the Punuk. The art of this period is characterized by rigid metal-cut lines and all-over patterns, of a style so local and individual that it is difficult to include it in our comparison. In the Punuk finds there also occur specimens with ornamentation like that of the Thule or the modern Alaskan art, which we are to interpret, perhaps, as forms introduced from a con- temporary Thule or a proto-Thule culture in the north. The typical Punuk style with mechanically drawn dot-and-circle, metal-cut lines, round bored dots at the ends of short lines and spurs, with red or black paint rubbed into the incisions, is, I 1 Collins, 1929, p. 47.</page><page sequence="18">494 FREDERICA DE LAGUNA believe, the result of the introduction of design elements and techniques from Si- beria, associated with the use of metal engraving tools, which produced a revolution in the art of the Old Bering Sea period. However, some of the designs are also characteristic of the Thule culture and, long before their introduction into Punuk art, may have existed on the Arctic coast of Alaska where they formed part of what was in many ways a simpler style, lacking the elaborate, all-over, connected pat- terns of the Old Bering Sea and Punuk art. The history of Eskimo art in Alaska and the chronological position of the Punuk phase are naturally of vital importance to our problem, but they can not be understood without more excavations, par- ticularly on the north coast. Among the Caribou Eskimo, who represent, according to Birket-Smith, the original stage of Eskimo culture, carved or decorated bone work is virtually non- existent.' However, the original Eskimo could not have been without art; its lack among the Caribou Eskimo is an extreme case of degeneration among the modern Central Eskimo. THE HUMAN FIGURE The human figures in the round of the Upper Palaeolithic might be compared to the dolls and figurines of the Eskimo. However, the human figure is not carved in the round in the Magdalenian, but is confined to the Aurignacian and the Sol- utrean, with the exception of one example about which opinions differ, and this is in itself an argument against a direct connection with the Eskimo. Almost all the Eskimo carvings of the human figure appear to be children's toys, except for a few puppets used by shamans. The Eskimo dolls represent both males and females, and for most the sex is not indicated at all. The carvings of the Palaeolithic, on the other hand, appear to be works of art, not toys, and with the exception of the man of BrUnn, Moravia, and a somewhat uncertain fragment from Brassempouy,2 all represent women with exaggerated sexual characteristics. The most typical of the Aurignacian figures are the so-called "Venuses" of Wil- lendorf in Austria, and of the Grotte des Rideaux at Lespugue in France. (Plate XIX A-2 and 7.)* Four female statuettes in crystalline talc from the caves of Grimaldi, near Mentone, are in the same style,3 as is also a modeled figure of a woman from Unterwisternitz, Moravia.4 The female torsos from the Grotte du Pape at Brassem- pouy have a much greater naturalism, which makes them stand a little apart from the rigid stylization of most of the Aurignacian statuettes. (Plate XIX A-i.) The Aurignacian type is characterized by the bowed head without features, the long pendent breasts, the spindling arms, folded above the breasts, which hang so low that the arms are usually at the level of the waist, the prominent belly, the fleshy hips, and the feetless legs which taper below the knees. The figures are quite naked, except the Lespugue Venus, who wears a little apron or fringed skirt below the buttocks. The hair, or a headdress, is often shown. The full front of a woman carved in low relief from the Aurignacian rock shelter of Laussel, Dordogne, should 1 Birket-Smith, 1929, I, p. 253. 2 E.

The principal stylistic features are the same, though the head is bent to the side, not bowed to the front, probably because of the difficulty of representing the traditional pose. MacCurdy considers the work unfinished, the artist intending to show the profile of the face,' but I think the features were purposely omitted in conformity with the tradition. The steatopygous female figure from Mentone, with erect, pointed head, and narrow hips, is very different from the other Aurignacian figures.2 A steatite statuette from Savignano sul Parano, Italy (Plate XIX A-4), also has the narrow hips, with a tendency towards steatopygy, and the shoulders terminate above in a pointed cone, suggestive of the pointed head of the Mentone figure. The other proportions of the body, especially the little arms folded over the breasts, place it in the ordinary Aurignacian tradition. The only Eskimo figure I can compare with those just described, is the ivory carving of a woman from Punuk, in the St. Lawrence Island group, Alaska. (Plate XIXA-6.) The resemblance is not close, however. As in the Aurignacian statuettes, the neck is bent forward, and the head, now missing, was probably bowed. The legs are slender and are together, though they do not appear to taper. The arms are too short, and are held close to the side and bent, as on the Aurignacian statuettes. This same attitude is also found on a shaman's doll (archaeological), from Point Hope, Alaska, probably representing a masculine figure. (Plate XIX A-5.) The belly of the Punuk woman is prominent, though not nearly as exaggerated as on the Aurig- nacian figures. The vulva is shown, which is not usual in Aurignacian statuettes,3 though it is found on incised representations. It is in the bodily proportions, how- ever, that the Punuk figure shows the most striking differences from the Aurig- nacian. The breasts are flat, and though pendent, do not fall too low; in consequence the arms are bent below, not above them. The buttocks are too small, and the hips are ridiculously narrow. In the narrowness and in the roll of fat over the hips there is a similarity to the Italian figure and the Laussel bas-relief, though the hips of the latter are very wide. The Magdalenian engraving of the "femme au renne," of Laugerie-Basse (Plate XIX A-8), has a few points of similarity with the Punuk statue. The vulva is shown, though the artist had to place it on the left side in order to get it into the picture. The woman appears to lack breasts, but this may be because they are flat, like the old woman's of Punuk. The arm is too short and too thin in proportion to the body. The hand ends at the knuckles as if closed or cut off there, as on the Punuk woman and the Point Hope man. The hands of the Aurignacian figures are usually open, with the fingers sketched in by a few lines. Beginning with the wrist of the Laugerie-Basse woman, and extending up to the elbow, are rows of parallel trans- verse lines, which I interpret as tattooing. The Punuk figure is also tattooed with transverse lines on the upper arms. Such tattooing is characteristic of Eskimo women, though the pattern may be more complex. 1 MacCurdy, I, explanation to fig. 162. 2 Boule, fig. 195-6. Cf., however, one of the Mentone figures, IH.

The crude figures carved out of mammoth metacarpals from the Solutrean station of Piedmost, Moravia,' which suggest seated, shrouded figures, and the Aurignacian figure from Pont-a-Lesse, Belgium, carved from a tip of antler,2 are of this clumsy type. A little better is the "fillette" of Brassempouy (Plate XIX B-3), which might be com- pared to the Eskimo dolls from the Thule culture (Plate XIX B-6, 8, 11), though the "fillette" has very prominent buttocks, and probably also had breasts, now broken off, while the Thule culture dolls from the central regions not only lack sex characters, but arms, and feet, and usually features. Mathiassen considers these dolls male, simply because the sex is not indicated.3 In the Thule culture in Greenland sex is clearly shown, as on a doll from Comer's Midden, North Greenland (Plate XIX B-11), but this is a later development in Greenland. I suggest that the similarity between the Brassempouy girl and the Eskimo dolls is due only to a sketchy naturalism and a crudity of representation rather than to any similarity in style. The best of the Aurignacian figures of this second group is the " Venus impudica" of Laugerie-Basse (Plate XIX B-1), which Sollas has compared to a modern Alaskan needle case in human form,4 and two ivory figures from Brassempouy,5 of which un- fortunately only the lower part of the body remains. These three female figures form a striking contrast to the fat, exaggerated women of the first group, and were perhaps intended to represent young girls. We have nothing quite like them in Eskimo art. The naturalism of Inugsuk, a late Thule site in Greenland, offers parallels,' but these are the product of a later and local Greenland development, as already explained. The figures from the Thule culture of Canada are stiffer, like those of modern Alaska, though there are some similarities between the "Venus impudica" and a modern Alaskan female figure (Plate XIX B-4). Although the Aurignacian figures we have discussed lack features, the artists of the time were able to portray them if they chose. The girl's head from the Grotte du Pape, Brassempouy (Plate XIX B-5) and the head of the man from Brtinn, Moravia, have features indicated by the cutting out of the ivory below the brows and about the nose. The mouth and eyes are not shown on the girl's head, while on the man's the mouth is indicated only by a faint line. The girl's hair, or headdress, is shown, somewhat conventionally, by a pattern of crossing vertical and horizontal lines, forming little squares. This is not the Eskimo method. The figure of a woman carved from a horse's tooth from Mas d'Azil, of uncertain age (Plate XIX B-2), is more realistic and has eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. The Eskimo dolls of the Thule cul- ture and of later periods in the east almost always lack the features. The face is usually cut off flat, and the head may be rounded in the back to suggest the ap- pearance of a head in a fur hood. However, when the features are shown, as they 1 G. H.

The Aurignacian method of cutting out the material below the brows and around the nose appears in the very few representations of the human figure which we know from the Scandinavian stone ages. The human head on the bone comb from Gdtland, Arctic Stone Age (Plate XIX B-7) is treated in the Aurignacian way, as are the amber charms, in the shape of human heads, from Carelia, Iand the Kurische Neh- rung, East Prussia,2 of approximately the same age. On the latter specimen, how- ever, a line is added for the mouth. We hesitate to infer any connection between these Neolithic figures and the Aurignacian, especially because of the vast gap in time, during which human representations are unknown. The human figure is rare in the stone age of Scandinavia. Among the minor but curious resemblances between Palaeolithic and Eskimo art, we must cite the Solutrean figure from the Vallke du Roc, Charente, France (Plate XIX B-9), carved from a block of limestone, with apparently natural rings, to which a face has been added at one end by incised lines for the eyes and mouth, in the Eskimo way, and on the other hand, a modern Alaskan ivory carving, representing the "man-worm," a mythical figure, with the segmented body of a worm, and the upper part of a man. (Plate XIX B-10.) It is impossible to determine the significance of this similarity, especially since the carvings are unique in their respective cultures. Lastly, the phallic representations of the Palaeolithic are practically absent from Eskimo art. The carved bone penis from the Sukkertoppen District, West Green- land, is a unique exception belonging only to the latter half of the seventeenth century.3 Mathiassen believes that the flat, featureless face and the lack of arms characteris- tic of the Thule dolls of Canada are due to the degeneration of Thule art in the east as compared to the earlier Thule stage in Alaska, from which he believes the Cana- dian Thule culture was derived. The dolls of this hypothetical earlier stage, like the modern Alaskan dolls, had arms and features,4 and it is with these, of which unfor- tunately we lack properly excavated examples, that we should compare the Aurigna- cian statuettes. Therefore, some of the resemblances between the Canadian Thule dolls and the Palaeolithic figures which might be cited-the lack of features, the tendency to omit the arms or to reduce them in size, and to show the legs pressed together and feet lacking-must be the result of chance parallelism, since, if Mathi- assen is right, these are later developments, peculiar to Canada. Moreover, another difference between Eskimo dolls in general and those of the Aurignacian must be cited. With the exception of the Lespugue "Venus," and two figures from Bras- sempouy, one with a "belt," the other with a "cape," both very doubtful,5 the Aurignacian statuettes are naked, whereas the Eskimo lolls are frequently shown with the amulet strap, the natit, or genital covering worn by both sexes, the belt, boots, or even the whole jacket. In fact, the head of the Canadian Thule dolls, 1 Pictures from the Collections, Helsingfors, p. 4-2. 2 Hoernes, 1925, p. 243, fig. 1. 3 Mathiassen, "Ancient Eskimo Settlements in the Kanghmiut Area," Meddelelser om Gr5nland XCIII, Copenhagen, 1931, fig. 35, and plate 5-9. 4 Mathiassen, 1930, p. 83. 5 Piette, pl.

The similarities between the Aurignacian figures from Europe and the Eskimo dolls are therefore not sufficient to prove any connection between the art of the two peoples. However, within the last few years, Palaeolithic statuettes have been dis- covered in central Russia and in the Lake Baikal district, Siberia ' which may lead us to modify this conclusion. In Central Russia (Kostienki and Gagarino), over 19 female figures were found. Some of these statuettes resemble the conventionalized European Aurignacian form, illustrated by the "Venuses" of Willendorf and Lespugue, others show an exaggerated female type, but less rigidly conventional- ized,2 while others, again, are more generalized human figures. The possibility that these statuettes may be related to the Eskimo carvings can not be dismissed. Their great numbers suggest that they may have been dolls, like the Eskimo figures, and the absence in many cases of the rigid conventionalization characteristic of the European statuettes, means a closer resemblance to the Eskimo dolls. Many of these Siberian statuettes have features, like the Alaskan dolls, and one has a rounded head with flat face, like the Thule dolls. However, we must beware of considering an imperfect naturalism as an indication of a true similarity, based on a common origin, for it can equally well result from degeneration of several distinct conven- tionalized styles. Engravings of human flgures are more difficult to find in the Upper Palaeolithic than are the representations of animals, and as a rule they are less skillfully executed. Luquet 3 finds that the human form is usually represented with animal-like aspects: hair on the body, muzzles instead of faces, protruding stomachs, stooping posture, etc. This, he explains, is because the Palaeolithic artists first portrayed animals, and when they turned to human beings gave them a bestial character simply because it belonged to the technique and art style they had already perfected. However, not all the peculiarities of the Palaeolithic human representations can be thus explained. The incised female figure from the cavern of La Colombiere,4 which is either final Aurignacian or early Magdalenian, is like an outline of the profile of one of the Aurignacian statuettes. Other female figures are the "femme au renne," already mentioned, and the woman with pendent breasts on the walls of the cave of Com- barelles.5 I exclude from this discussion the painted figures in the Spanish caves, for the style seems to be local, and though analogies to Bushman art have been pointed out, there was, in any case, no spreading of this type of painting to the north. The male figures are more numerous. I have figured (Plate XX A, B) the man stalking a bison from Laugerie-Basse, the man with a stick from La Madeleine, the sorcerer of Lourdes, the anthropomorphic figure from Mas d'Azil, and the sorcerer engraved and painted on the wall of the cave of Trois-Frbres in Aribge.

Among the more fantastic figures, we have the grinning faces at Marsoulas, of Magdalenian age;2 the Aurignacian animal-headed monsters of Altamira, Spain;3 and the grotesque figures of Combarelles, Dordogne," which include a curious creature with the head of a girl, the body of a pregnant woman, and a man's sexual organ. There are also human figures with animal heads and other monstrous forms difficult to interpret. Besides the human figures with animal heads (Altamira, Combarelles, Mas d'Azil), there are men with remarkably high pointed heads (Lourdes, Laugerie- Basse, La Madeleine, Marsoulas, La ColombiZ're, the last superimposed on the figure of the woman, and one figure, though not very human in the features, from Combarelles). This high pointed head is hardly an animal characteristic; neither are the full beards (Trois-Frbres and Lourdes). Another striking feature of the style is a long, rather heavy body, which the sorcerer of Trois-Frbres illustrates quite clearly. It is also found in the figures of Lourdes, Laugerie-Basse, La Madeleine, Mas d'Azil, etc. This heavy, disproportioned body, however, is not found on the Aurignacian figure of a man in low relief on a limestone block from Laussel,5 and it may be a Magdalenian feature. There is also a tendency towards small feet (Trois- FrBres). We have seen that on the Aurignacian statuettes there was a tendency to slight the feet for stylistic reasons, which appears also with the Magdalenian male figures from Laugerie-Basse and La Madeleine. The body is often bowed, as in the case of the figures of Trois-Fre'res and Mas d'Azil,-though here the body of the latter is probably bent to fit the round area of the bone disk,-the figures at Alta- mira, and especially those at Combarelles, where the men go almost on all-fours. Representations of the human figure in Eskimo graphic art are not closely com- parable with those just discussed. They are executed in the silhouetting technique, (Plate XX B-3), which I shall describe in detail in connection with the representations of animals. The Eskimo men are usually reduced to their simplest forms, a dot for the head, and lines for the body and for the limbs. (Plate XX B, 3,5,6.) They are much smaller in scale than the Magdalenian figures, and only in a few cases do we find them large enough to make possible any real comparison. The human figures on two archaeological combs from Alaska have the same long heavy body, with a tendency to a protruding paunch, which Luquet called an animal trait in Palaeo- lithic art, and the same bent attitude, though for the Point Hope figure it is hardly a stylistic feature. (Plate XX B-3 and 4.) The engravings on Central Eskimo combs (Plate XX B-10) seem to be quite mod- ern and were probably made under white influence. The figures are clothed, not naked like the Palaeolithic representations. Some of the Palaeolithic figures have been taken for men disguised as animals. The sorcerers of Lourdes and Trois-FrZres, with their tails and horns, certainly impersonate animals.

The arms are not shown, but the figures appear to be enveloped in shaggy fur robes, which is perhaps the only example in Palaeolithic art of complete clothing. The monstrous animal-headed creatures of Altamira may also be men disguised as animals. MacCurdy mentions the representation of a human figure with a bear's head from Mas d'Azil, and another with a horse's head from the cave of Espdlugues at Lourdes.2 A male and female figure, wearing masks representing animal heads, have been found incised on pebbles at La Madeleine.3 Masks and animal disguise for festivals are found among the Eskimo, particularly in Alaska, where the masked ceremonial has been greatly stimulated by contact with Northwest Coast Indians. The mask, however, is a common Eskimo trait, presumably very old." It has a wide, though sporadic distribution in North and South America, as well as in Siberia.5 It is not improbable that the mask, or animal impersonation, originated in the Palaeolithic, but we must not suppose that the connections are any closer between the cave men and the Eskimo, than between the former and almost any other modern primitive people. Birket-Smith's distribution appears confined to the circumpolar area only because of the limits he set for him- self. We have a few examples of figures disguised as animals in Eskimo art. (Plate XX B-7 and 8.) The shaft-straightener originally figured by Boyd Daw- kins is decorated with figures of caribou and men disguised as caribou, dancing with horns on their heads and in their hands. (Plate XXIII A-2.) A scene taken from a modern Alaskan specimen shows a festival with two men beating drums, and five dancers with animal heads and ears. An eighth figure lifts something in the air, (Plate XX B-8.) Although we do find a similarity in subject between these Eskimo engravings and the Magdalenian figures, we must not overlook the great difference in technique. The Eskimo figures are shown only in silhouette. ANIMAL REPRESENTATIONS The range of animals depicted during the Upper Palaeolithic, incised or carved in bone and ivory, or incised and painted in caves, is rather large. The horse was the most popular, followed by the red deer, the reindeer and other deer, the bison, and the wild goat," but almost every species of beast, bird, and fish known to Palaeolithic man was represented.7 In Eskimo art the whale, caribou, seal, bear, dog, and birds are the most common, while other animals are rarely represented. The repertory is thus not nearly so extensive as in the Upper Palaeolithic. The difference can be explained in part by the absence from the Arctic of some of the species the cave men knew, but also by the fact that where Eskimo art was most highly developed the hunting was chiefly of aquatic, not land mammals. One of the chief differences between the two arts lies in the lack of cave painting among the Eskimo.

Those which I saw in Cook Inlet were very small figures of men and animals, executed in solid red silhouette. The surface of the rock showed no preparation and with one excep- tion the figures did not seem to have much relationship to each other. The animals were in general better executed than the human or anthropomorphic figures. How- ever, these paintings can hardly be used to prove connection with Palaeolithic Europe, because they have been discovered only in southwestern Alaska, a periph- eral region of Eskimo culture, and their occurrence there is possibly due to influence from Indians in the South.1 The Eskimo method of incising animal forms on bone and ivory is quite different from that employed by Palaeolithic artists. The latter generally represented the animal on so large a scale that they were able to show the body markings. In the finest Palaeolithic examples the coat of the animal is carefully represented by rows of short parallel strokes in the direction of the hair. This method of rendering the hair is so characteristic that Hoernes finds in it the prototype of all the simple geometric decorations,2 a view I consider extreme. I would say, rather, that the rows of short incisions and notches which are such common elements in non-repre- sentative art have been carried over and incorporated into the technique of realistic representation. There is a tendency to enhance the decorative effect of the natural body patterning. (Plate XXI A-1.) The same method of indicating the hair is found on animals in the round, as for example, on the famous Magdalenian horse from Lourdes (Plate XXII B-1), where the edge of the shaggy coat is indicated by very short vertical lines forming a zig-zag band. The zig-zag lines on the flanks may have become further stylized into the triangles on the flanks of animals in- cised on the walls of caves, like the horse at Combarelles (Plate XXI A-q), and from which Shetelig tried to derive the triangles and zig-zag lines on the reindeer engraved on rocks in Norway.3 Besides the arrangement of short vertical lines in zig-zag bands, we find other conventionalizations of the body markings, for example in the treatment of the mane of the bison on the Magdalenian "bdton de commandement" from Laugerie- Basse (Plate XXIII A-1) and on the feathers of the grouse on a Magdalenian throwing-stick from Mas d'Azil.4 Even the scales on the salmon in the famous carving from Lorthet of the stags crossing a salmon stream have been made into patterns. (Plate XXII A-5.) This attention to the details of the animal's markings and the representation of fur, in particular, is quite foreign to Eskimo art, except during very recent times, in carvings made under white supervision for the tourist trade. The older method, represented in the realistic Thule etchings, in archaeological finds from Alaska, and in modern but old-fashioned Alaskan art, invariably shows the animals and other figures in silhouette, the entire space being filled in with single or cross-hatching, depending on the size of the area. In modern times, black paint, consisting of char- coal from burned grass mixed with oil, is rubbed into the cuts.6 We have no evi- 1 "Eskimo Rock Paintings in Cook Inlet," by the author, in preparation. 2 Hoernes, op. cit. first edition, 1898, p. 43.

The rubbing of paint into incisions was introduced during the Punuk period and is applied to non-representative as well as to realistic art. The same methods of scratching out the space is used in representations of men, houses, tents, boats, sledges, etc. We might be tempted to suggest that the Eskimo shows everything in silhouette in this way, because that is how objects and animals most often appear to him, black against the white snow. However, just as the short parallel lines, zig-zag and crossing lines of the Upper Palaeolithic, which are used in representative art as the mechanism of rendering detail, exist independently in non-representative art, so do the single- and the cross-hatching of the Eskimo appear as parts of geometric patterns, not only in Thule and modern art, but also in the Old Bering Sea period. Even the double line with alternating internal spurs, per- haps the most characteristic element of Eskimo art, has entered the domain of animal representation, as on a modern ivory drill bow from Port Clarence, Alaska (Plate XXI A-5), where both this design and cross-hatching fill in the bodies of the walrus. This use of the double line with alternating internal spurs is quite un- usual, but shows how closely the non-representative style and technique control the development of realistic art. Eskimo art has nothing comparable to the sketchy and impressionistic, but often spirited outlining of animals, characteristic of the Upper Palaeolithic. Hoffman has drawn attention to this difference in spirit.' However, the subject of this Magdalenian technique, usually an animal head (Plate XXI A-3, 4), is often re- peated several times, resembling the decorative use of the walrus head by the Eskimo. (Plate XXI A-7.) In the Eskimo examples the heads are usually bounded by two straight lines, the lower one representing the water, from which the heads emerge. They are not arbitrarily cut off, as are the Magdalenian animals' heads. The latter are not usually repeated as often as the Eskimo walrus heads and are not transverse but are likely to be placed longitudinally on the object. The neatness of the arrangement, due largely to the bordering lines on the Eskimo specimens, is not characteristic of the Palaeolithic. The bottom line, in more elaborate Eskimo specimens, represents the ground or the surface of the water, sometimes for two sets of figures, one of which, of course, is upside down with reference to the other (Plate XXI B-3), or both borders may serve as ground for two different scenes, producing a similar effect. (Plate XXI B-6.) In Palaeolithic art the ground is rarely shown (as an exception see Plate XXII A-2) and sometimes in Eskimo art the figures are arbitrarily scattered.2 In general, however, the bor- dering lines, in both realistic and geometric art, make one of the most striking differ- ences between the style of Eskimo art and Palaeolithic. Besides conventionalizing and repeating the heads of animals, the artists of the Upper Palaeolithic did the same with smaller parts, for example, the horns and the ears, or the horns and the eye.3 Though this is very different from anything in 1 Hoffman, p. 765, for examples, cf. Hoernes, 1925, pp. 36-37. 2 Like the caribou on an archaeological kayak scraper from Point Barrow, Alaska (Copenhagen, P 15-297). 3 Hoernes, 1925, p. 149, and Breuil, 1913, fig. 19-2, and fig. 40-2.</page><page sequence="27">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 503 Eskimo art, I can cite an isolated case of similarity in the use of the fish's or whale's tail. The Eskimo are fond of taking the latter as it sticks up out of the sea, and repeating it as an element in a decorative band, as they do the walrus head. (Plate XXI B-7 and 8.) I think that the whale's tail design and the Y figures on a line have had a mutual influence on each other. The similarity of the whale's tail to the Y and its significance as a whaling amulet have both stimulated its use as a decorative element. On a "bdton de commandement" from the beginning of the final Magdalenian, from Raymondin, Chancelade (Plate XXI B-2) we have two vertical whale's tails, connected around the cylindrical shaft by a continuation of their outlines. However, they do not form a real border in the Eskimo way and they are combined in a haphazard fashion with geometric figures and schematized animals of a character very different from anything in Eskimo art. Among the superficial similarities in subject we should mention the animal skin, though from the Palaeolithic I can cite only one example, the skin of a fox (?) on a spear point. (Plate XXI B-5.) This can be compared to the figures of skins on modern Alaskan drill bows, which are, however, blocked out by cross-hatching. (Plate XXI B-4.) On most of the Eskimo examples, the skins are repeated as trans- verse elements of a longitudinal band.' The simplest type of composition of animal representations is the repetition of exactly similar figures, like elements of a formal design. This is very characteristic of Eskimo art. (Plate XXI A-6, 8.) We find similar repetitions in the final Magdalenian. (Plate XXI A-9.) Lest we be tempted to see the conventionalized Eskimo figures as the final stage from an early Palaeolithic naturalism towards that greater stylization characteristic of the final Magdalenian, we must remember that the few animal figures of the Maglemosian show a return to realism before the final extinction of incised animal representation, and that the conventionalization in the final Magdalenian, with the distortion of the bodily proportions, is very different from Eskimo conventionalization, which is hardly more than a simplification and stiffening. We find some attempts at composition into a picture in the Upper Palaeolithic, especially in the latter half of the Magdalenian, but they are never very successful in grouping more than a few animals, or in the handling of perspective. The stags crossing a salmon stream, on a piece of antler from Lorthet (Plate XXII A-5), ex- emplify this failure, all the more striking because the individual animals are so beautifully executed. We must note, however, a certain stiffness in the attitude of the last stag, which is looking backwards. The Magdalenian artists have not fully mastered the technique of presenting animals in any but strict profile. However, the real difficulty comes from introducing the salmon into the picture and is aug- mented by the restrictions of space, since the whole composition is incised on the cylindrical surface of an antler. The salmon themselves are faithfully represented, but they have been, so to speak, taken out of the water and squeezed between the legs of the stags; two are even in the air above the backs of the deer. A somewhat similar effect is found on the poorer Eskimo examples, as in the hunting scene from Point Barrow, Alaska (Plate XXI B-6), in which a man is shooting at two animals, 1 Hoffman, pl. 21-1 and 4, pl. 22-3, and pl. 59-1.</page><page sequence="28">504 FREDERICA DE LAGUNA perhaps caribou, while two whales apparently float through the air over his head. The difficulty here results from an attempt to depict two unrelated scenes in a limited space. A very crude type of composition is illustrated by the pendant from Raymondin, Chancelade,' incised with a picture of five men feasting on a dismem- bered bison, in which the human figures are each viewed from the back, and are grouped about the bison as on a map, not as in a picture in perspective. A similar effect is produced in a modern Eskimo illustration of a shamanistic ceremony, very crudely drawn.2 On the latter specimen further confusion arises from representing the shaman several times, at different stages of the ceremony. However, the best of the Eskimo realistic pictures surpass those of the Magdalenian in the composition of the figures and in the spirited and natural attitudes of the men and animals. The representation of animals in various attitudes does not seem to present great diffi- culties. (Plate XXI B-1.) Sollas has already pointed out the great difference be- tween Eskimo and Palaeolithic art in that the Eskimo drawings seem to tell a story, often illustrating actual events, while Palaeolithic art does not.3 The difference in the treatment of animals massed in a herd is significant of the difference in fundamental principles. The two best known Magdalenian examples, both from the latter half of the period, are the herds of wild horses, engraved in broken lines on a stone, from the cave of Chaffaud, Vienne, France (Plate XXII A-9), and the reindeer engraved on a wing bone of an eagle from the cave of La Mairie, Dordogne. (Plate XXII A-1.) The leaders of the horses are almost completely outlined, though rather sketchily, especially in the legs. For the rest of the herds, there are only the heads, all in a line on the same level, each somewhat obscured by the one in front, with the outlines of the neck ending abruptly. The bodies are not indicated at all, and the effect of legs is given by a row of short lines, just above the ground. The last animal in each herd is more fully drawn, with the outline of the chest and back indicated. The reindeer exemplify the same impressionistic tendency carried still further. The first three deer and the last one are drawn almost completely, even to the hairs of the coat and the shaggy mane. The rest of the herd is nothing but a line of horns, all too large, and under them a band of short vertical lines, which run into the body hairs on the last of the three leaders and into the legs of the last animal in the herd. On modern Eskimo examples of herds of caribou (Plate XXII A-3, 4) the bodies are represented by a solid horizontal band, filled in by neat vertical hatching (like a variant of the "ladder" pattern discussed later). Sometimes the heads are lifted above this band, but in other cases the animals stand in the slouching attitude, characteristic of caribou, with only the horns, drawn in neat pairs, sticking up above the band. The legs appear to be in the proper groups of four, corresponding to each pair of antlers, but it is not possible to distinguish the individual animals, and the herd remains merely schematized. The difference between the Eskimo and the Palaeolithic herds seems to result in part from the Eskimo tendency to fit ani- mals into a formal pattern, a tendency perhaps due to the greater relative strength of the purely geometric designs in Eskimo art, and partly from the Magdalenian trend towards a sketchy impressionism. This latter principle is in direct oppo- 1 MacCurdy, I, fig. 137. 2 Hoffman, fig. 142. 3 Sollas, 1924, pp. 584-585.</page><page sequence="29">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 505 sition to that other Magdalenian tendency to emphasize the details of the body markings, and both are embodied in the reindeer herd from La Mairie. The similarities between Eskimo and Upper Palaeolithic carvings of animals in the round have been exaggerated. There is nothing in Palaeolithic art comparable to the little carvings of swimming birds, so characteristic of both ancient and modern Eskimo art. Sometimes the bird ends with the upper part of a human body, rather conventionalized, instead of a bird's head (Plate XXIII B-13) and such mixing of human and animal parts is quite foreign to Palaeolithic art. The Eskimo, however, have nothing corresponding to the horses' heads cut out of thin bone, with highly styl- ized hair, and markings about the muzzle, which the Abbe Breuil has interpreted as representations of the teeth under the skin.' But as these figures are typical of the Middle Magdalenian alone, it is not surprising that they are not found among the Eskimo. In the Thule culture, however, there are silhouette figures, cut out of thin sheets of baleen, representing a whale, from Point Barrow, Alaska,2 a bird, from Naujan, Melville Peninsula, Canada,3 and a bear, from Inugsuk, West Green- land." These figures have no markings, only the outline being given. The chief difference between the carved animal figures of the Eskimo and of the Upper Palaeolithic is that the former are usually quite plain or else are ornamented with non-representative designs, while the animals of the Upper Palaeolithic are finished, like the incised figures; by lines emphasizing the body markings. However, there are exceptions: some Palaeolithic carvings are plain, and in Eskimo art we may find the eyes, mouth, ears, whiskers of animals, and the fins and gills of fish, etc., indicated, though usually in the simplest manner with dots and lines. It is not easy to tell whether the dots so common on the swimming bird figures and on other little carvings are intended to represent the patterning of the natural markings or are merely non-representative elements applied to the carvings. (Plate XXIII A-8 and Plate XXIII B-4, 8, 13, 15, 17.) However, the most elaborate of the purely realistic Eskimo carvings never approaches the type of work illustrated by the bison from Laugerie-Basse or the horse from Lourdes, nor does the most decorative treat- ment of hair on Upper Palaeolithic carvings ever produce so geometric a design as the compass-drawn dot-and-circles, the double line with alternating internal spurs, which is not unusual on Eskimo animal figures. (Plate XXIII B-14, 16.) Another difference, though it, too, admits of exceptions, is that the Eskimo carvings of ani- mals, like those of human beings, seem to be toys, while those of the Upper Palaeo- lithic give the impression of being more serious works of art. There are only certain species of animals represented in the round by both peo- ples. Carved ivory bears are characteristic of the Thule culture and are common in modern Alaska. Bears are not common in Upper Palaeolithic art, and I have been able to find only one example in the round, a carving in stone, from the cave of Isturitz, Basse-Pyr~nbes, France. (Plate XXII B-6.) Unfortunately the head is missing, and the hind legs are broken. Moreover the species is very different from the Polar bear, which has a long body and neck. The Eskimo examples, on the IPiette, pl. X-4, from Lorthet, pl. LXXVIII-3, from Brassempouy, etc. 2 Mathiassen, 1930, pl. 11-10. 3 Mathiassen, 1927, I, fig. 14. 4Mathiassen, M.o.G. 1930, pl. 19-15.</page><page sequence="30">506 FREDERICA DE LAGUNA whole, seem more conventionalized. The neck tends to run into the head without a distinct separation, which is an exaggeration of the natural appearance of the animal, and the forelegs are underemphasized in comparison with the hind legs. (Plate XXII B-2.) The final stage in this degeneration is found in the modern Central Eskimo ajagaq. (Plate XXII B-3.) This type of conventionalization is certainly foreign to the Palaeolithic. The bear from Ponds Inlet is a good example of the application of a geometric design to a realistic figure. Over the back is a design suggesting a harness, though Mathiassen points out that it is defective,' consisting of the line with spurs on one side, the double line with alternating internal spurs, and the "ladder" pattern, all elements common in non-representative art. Here, these designs have nothing to do with the coat of the animal. In this connection we might mention a carved bear figure from the Chukchi, decorated with dots and V shaped lines (Plate XXII B-4) and the figures on an ivory pipe from Kamchatka, ornamented with carvings of two men hunting a walrus and two bears. (Plate XXII B-5.) Across the backs of the bears and the stomach of the walrus is a continuation of the same pattern which covers the lower part of the pipe stem. A powder-charge measure from the Ostyak of the Vas-Jugan River, carved to represent a bear, is covered with a pattern of little gouged triangles.2 That the decoration of bears and other animal figures with conventional patterns may be very old is suggested by the Maglemosian amber bear, from the swamp at Resen, in Denmark,3 decorated with the characteristic Maglemosian design of the double line with diagonal cross-hatching and crossing lines forming lozenges. The first pattern is found in both Eskimo and Magdalenian art, the second is peculiar to the Maglemo- sian. Since the specimen is unique in the Scandinavian Neolithic, not much weight can be attached to it. Fish figures, probably fish lures, are found in both the Upper Palaeolithic and Eskimo cultures. Those of the Eskimo are carved to represent fish, while most of the Palaeolithic examples are made from bear's teeth or are cut from thin plates of bone. On the Eskimo specimens the eyes are indicated by dots, the gills are out- lined, the medial line down the side may be a simple straight line, or may have fine spurs on both sides (like that on one of the salmon in the stag picture from Lorthet), or the medial line may join the outline of the gill. The spines of the fins and the tail may be represented by lines. (Plate XXIII B-2, 3, 4, 8.) These devices are also found on Palaeolithic representations of fish (Plate XXIII B-1, 5) but since they are of the simplest nature, they can hardly show a real similarity in style. There are resemblances in the secondary use of animal forms, especially as decora- tions on handles, or on the ends of objects. Animal carvings on objects are found in the Old Bering Sea, Thule, and modern Eskimo cultures. Buttons, toggles, han- dles of knives, bodkins, and shaft-straighteners, dart foreshafts, finger rests for harpoons, the flaring ends of comb handles, of thimble holders, and of reels, the knobs on needle cases, etc., are given an animal form, usually the head of a seal, a walrus, or the like. The Eskimo shaft-straighteners published by Boyd Dawkins 1 Mathiassen, 1927, I, p. 186. 2 National Museum, Helsingfors, 3904.590. I. Miller, Uldtidens Kunst i Danmark, I, Copenhagen, 1918, fig. 24.</page><page sequence="31">ESKIMO AND PALAEOLITHIC ART 507 and by Hoffman (Plate XXIII A-9, 5 and 7) show rather striking analogies to the "bdtons de commandement " from the early Magdalenian of Le Placard, figured by Breuil. (Plate XXIII A-3, 4, 6, 10.) The similarity becomes more significant if we accept Boyd Dawkins' suggestion that these are also shaft-straighteners.1 The plac- ing of two animal heads back to back, illustrated by Boyd Dawkin's shaft-straight- ener, and by Eskimo combs and thimble holders,2 also occurs in Palaeolithic art, as Sollas has pointed out, for example on the " bdton de commandement " from Laugerie- Basse, which Sollas compares to that figured by Boyd Dawkins.3 (Plate XXIII A-1.) The animal's head on an archaeological hunting dagger from Point Hope, Alaska (Plate XXIII A-9), also resembles a head on an implement from Le Placard. (Plate XXIII A-10.) However, not much weight can be attached to these similarities, which appear, on closer examination, to be due only to a sort of sketchy naturalism, a lack of precise style, rather than to a real similarity in artistic rendering. Animal heads as decorations appear on the slate knives of the Arctic Stone Age,4 on the famous bone comb from Gitland, with the human face, already described, and animal heads of a similar style are also found in the Finnish Neolithic.5 How- ever, the decoration of objects with animal heads occurs so widely and is so natural that these specimens can only suggest the possibility that the Eskimo, among many others, share in this common Palaeolithic tradition. However, proof of this must remain uncertain since the animal heads of the Neolithic in Scandinavia and East Prussia 6 have a style of their own, different from both the Eskimo and the Palaeo- lithic. Hrdlicka 7 has made a comparison between the modern Alaskan Eskimo carvings of a kneeling animal embracing the handle of a knife and a similar Magdalenian carving from the rock shelter of Monastruc at Bruniquel. The specimen from Bruniquel, as Hrdli6ka figures it, is incomplete. The object as mended, some years after it was found, does not appear to be a dagger, and there are two reindeer on it, not one, so that some of the similarity to the Eskimo forms is lost.8 Furthermore, we can not stress the position of the animals, since it is dictated by the requirements of utility and of the restricted space. The Eskimo use the whale tail in the round to decorate objects. Hoffman has illustrated some of the more elaborate forms on modern Alaskan specimens (Plate XXI B-8), some of which have rows of tails, the flukes touching and in some cases 1 It must be remembered that it is the Aurignacian and lower Magdalenian " bdtons "which resemble the Eskimo shaft-straighteners; those of the upper Magdalenian, however, are quite different. As the Abbe Breuil has suggested, it is possible that we have been grouping under the single term, "bdtons de commandement," or shaft-straighteners, implements of several different functions, and that one explanation will not cover them all. As far as the Eskimo are concerned, the shaft-straightener is not found in the Thule culture in Canada, and though found archaeologically in Alaska (Mathiassen, 1930), is probably not very ancient there. 2Mathiassen, 1927, I, pl. 76-7, and 1930, pl. 11-6. 3Sollas, 1924, p. 258. 4 Montelius, "Sur les souvenirs de l'age de la pierre des lapons en Subde," Congres International d'Anthropologie et d'Archeologie prdhistoriques, I, Stockholm, 1874, fig. 18. 5 Pictures from the Collections, Helsingfors, figs. 7 and 8. 6 Cf. the amber and clay figures, Hoernes, 1925, p. 243, figs. 4 to 7. 7 A.

(Plate XXIII B-6.) We might compare these and similar Eskimo carvings, with the fish and fish tails used as pendants (Plate XXIII B-7), and as handles of spatulas in the Magdalenian. (Plate XXIII B-9 to 19.) However, in this comparison, differences between the styles are again more apparent than the similarities. (To be continued) FREDERICA DE LAGUNA.
