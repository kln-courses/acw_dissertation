<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sodomitic Lions of Granada GLENN W. OLSEN University of Utah, Salt Lake City Even before the appearance in 1980 of John Boswell's Christian? ity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, scholars had shown some interest in the presence of "homoeroticism" in medieval Spain.1 Their attention centered on erotic themes found in Jewish and Muslim poetry associated with the tenth-century urban culture of Andalusia, the Muslim south of Spain. According to many scholars, during Andalusia's "golden age" ad- herents to the three monotheist religions?Islam, Judaism, and Christian? ity?lived tolerantly together in convivencia.2 Moreover, according to Boswell, Andalusia was a particularly good example of what was common throughout early medieval Europe and lost only in the High Middle Ages? a society that tolerated homosexuality and gay people. Though erotic poetry provides a particularly rich lode for those wish- ing to study same-sex phenomena in medieval Spain, other kinds of evi? dence have also survived?sculptural as well as textual. Sculpture embodying sexual motifs was more abundant in the Christian Romanesque north during the eleventh and twelfth centuries than at any period in Islamic Spain, presumably because portraying the human body was proscribed by Islam. Still, in 1982 Norman Roth brilliantly linked the sculpture on one ofthe Islamic ablutional basins discovered by archaeologists near Cordoba Earlier versions of this essay were given at the annual conference of the Mediterranean Studies Association, May 31,2002, Granada, Spain, and the annual meeting ofthe Medieval Association ofthe Pacific, Portland State University, March 29, 2003.

Olsen earlier in the century to the treatment of love of boys in the poetry.3 Though part ofthe argument ofthe present study is that Roth made some impor? tant mistakes, his goal is noteworthy: a contextual interpretation of a ba- sin that at first glance has nothing sexual about it. He established a histori? cal context by using contemporary Jewish and Muslim poetry to "read" the basin's sculpture and extract its sexual meaning. Such a contextual reading seems to me a reasonable way to approach much medieval sculpture. On matters sexual, the artistic record of both the Christian north and Muslim south of Spain is especially difficult to interpret: no surviving written documents explain straightforwardly its meaning. In an earlier study I attempted to show for the Christian church in the north of Spain that has the greatest profusion of erotic sculptural themes what a contextual reading can achieve.4 Here I wish to do something similar for a quartet of Islamic ablutional basins, including the one studied by Roth, that originated around 1000 in the vicinity of Cordoba but are now scattered in northern Africa and Spain. My goal is not simply to place specific works of art within a plausible historical context but to illustrate the degree to which a historical context can be recovered by giving attention to all the kinds of evidence that remain?political, geographical, literary, religious, and artistic. The end in view is the recovery of a way of life, in particular, the interlace of sexual attitudes, ideas, and practices. Of necessity, Jewish and, especially, Arabic poetry have a prominent place in the discussion that follows. But Christian materials fill out the picture, showing how relative outsiders viewed "goings- on" centered at the caliphal court in Cordoba. The life of a Christian saint, Pelagius, recently studied for what it tells us of "sodomy" at this time, reveals even more when aligned with the nonliterary record. Today in the Museo Arqueologico de Cordoba stands a rectangular basin (figure 1) discovered in 1926 in the ruins of Alamiria (Almeria), the palace or country house of Almanzor (939-1002) in the Sierra de Cordoba, just to the west of Medina al-Zahra.5 Alamiria was an extensive palace city that was begun about 936 by Caliph Abd al-Rahman III (912-67) and took 3"'Deal gently with the young man': Love of Boys in Medieval Hebrew Poetry of Spain," Speculum 57 (1982): 20-51. 4Glenn W.

A tenth-century caliphal capital in the same museum (D/C.C. 133) has four musicians on it with mutilated faces, evidence that Islamic prohibitions against portraying the human body could be flouted at this time but might face iconoclastic retaliation. Anthropomorphic animals skirted such controversy In trying to place this basin in context, Rafael Castejon called attention to another ablutional basin now found in the Museo de la Alhambra (Museo Nacional de Arte-Hispano-Musulman) (figure 2).9 This second basin, which is the focus ofthe present study, was brought to Granada by Badis (1038- 73), the king ofthe Ziri taifa (small state), after the Berbers destroyed Medina al-Zahra and the Cordoban palaces.10 In its present recut form, this basin seems to date from 1304, when Muhammad III had it placed at the entrance to the Alcazaba, the kernel of the present Alhambra.11 Made of marble, it is 60.5 cm high, 114 cm long, and 88 cm wide. In a scene portrayed on each of its two longitudinal sides (figures 2 and 3), four lions have seized four goats, gazelles, ibexes, stags, or antelopes from behind; the lions' mouths are at the back ofthe necks ofthe animals under attack, and the lions' forepaws are on their backs; no further bodily contact is evident.12 The labels in the Alhambra museum describe the gazelles as cervidos (deer), but in such carving it is often difficult to distinguish among deer, goats, ibexes, antelopes, and gazelles. In any case, it is unclear that sculptural portrayal of any of these animals was based on direct observation.13 Taken 8Castej6n portrays further lions and lion heads throughout (203), gives a picture ofthe detail of an anthropomorphic lion head, and comments on further mustachioed lions (205). 9Cataloged R.E. 243 in the Palacio de Carlos V, it was found on the Alhambra grounds.

Olsen literally, so to speak, this seems to be a hunting scene.14 Castejon has no explanation for this composition beyond noting that animals play a great role in the caliphal art of Cordoba, that fierce animals often attack gentle ones, and that lions bite deer or goats.15 Markus Hattstein takes the basin's scene to "symbolize the triumph of Islam over its enemies," the victories of Almanzor.16 This is quite possible and is compatible with other symbolic meanings that will be explored in the present essay. The figures on the Alhambra basin merit further description.17 The scene on the two long side panels, already mentioned, displays what various scholars have taken to be symbolic manifestations of royal power, the lions representing the caliph.18 These panels also have in their center a small tree of life, the symbol of abundance and eternity.19 Though the idea that in Andalusia gardens were designed to recall paradise has recently been challenged, the themes of trees, vegetal ornament, and paradise were common in Islamic architecture and sculpture, as in the Great Mosque of Cordoba itself, "a sacred, a paradisal garden."20 In secular poetry, Arabic and Hebrew, the garden could simply symbolize the good life.21 The scene on the two short side panels of the Alhambra basin portrays on the Latin world, what he says is sometimes useful for understanding Islamic portrayal. Similarly, Florence McCulloch, Medieval Latin and French Bestiaries (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1962), chap. 5, lists the characteristics associated with these various beasts in the Latin and French bestiaries, noting, as at 85, widespread confusion about the identity of some of these animals?an antelope, for instance, that according to some resembled a goat. 14 Arte isldmico en Granada, 279-80, discusses the inscription, which helps date the basin's removal to Granada. 15Castejon, 200-2, for this and the following. On 202 is a picture ofa later basin for ablutions, also in the Museo de Cordoba, from the Almoravid period beginning in the late eleventh century with a base on which one lion attacks another below him. Throughout Castejon notes additional lions that can be found in other museums. 16"History," in Hattstein and Delius, eds., 208-17 at 216, for a detail ofthe basin, which Hattstein dates to ca. 980. In the same volume, Almut von Gladiss, "Decorative Arts," 238-43 at 239, gives a picture ofthe basin. 17The basin is excellently displayed and thoroughly described in its museum exhibit, which is the basis for what follows. 18For the ancient iconography ofthe various animals mentioned in this essay, see Jocelyn M.

The eagles' claws grasp deer or some similar animal below them. Lions and eagles, both possessing the nobility and strength of the predator, symbolized rule.22 In these scenes, taken together, we seem to have a statement about the ruler's power and an expression of hope that his rule will be stable, fruitful, and continuing. In addition to the basins now found at Cordoba and the Alhambra are two similar ones located at Marrakech and Madrid. I have seen only pictures of the former, made in Andalusia between 1002 and 1007 and now at Marrakech, but its side panels appear to be similar to those of both the Alhambra basin and the basin now in Madrid.23 The Madrid basin, made in 987-88 and also from Medina al-Zahra, has been in the Calle lista in Seville but is currently in the Museo Arqueologico Nacional in Madrid (N. inv. 50.248). It has a well-preserved, long front panel composed of three arches, within each of which is foliage or a stylized tree of life, and two central shafts 22Joyce E.

Existing understanding of the lions and eagles on these basins seems secure. Aggressive animals, especially lions, had long symbolized protection and are found as talismans in Ionian, Persian, Byzanrine, and Arab culture.27 24G6mez-Moreno, 189, with photograph; Luis Balmaseda Muncharaz, Juan Zozaya Stabel-Hansen, and Maria Angela Franco Mata, Edad Media (Madrid, n.d.), 66-67, with photograph.

Rear panel, Madrid basin (see figure 5). One need merely recall the great lions of Assyrian or Persian art, the row of lions facing the sea at Rhodes, the menagerie of lions outside the Arsenal in Venice (the city ofthe Lion of Saint Mark), or, for that matter, Patience and Fortitude, the lions in front ofthe New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. Lions fill late Roman and medieval Christian sculpture.28 The lion, which is the first animal presented in most bestiaries and is treated in the opening chapter ofthe Latin Physiologus as the king of beasts, was an obvious choice to symbolize rulership.29 There were many lions in Andalusia, though the most famous are later than our tenth- or early-eleventh-century basins of Cordoban origin but not generally later than the recutting ofthe Alhambra basin around 1304. Though the magnificent complex that existed in Seville when the Christians reconquered the town in 1248 has either disappeared or been gready modified, the exquisite Patio del Yeso survives. It is a remembrance ofthe 28Michel Pastoureau, "Pourquoi tant de lions dans POccident medieval?"

Olsen time in the twelfth century when Seville was the capital ofthe Almohades' taifa kingdom. Nearby are the Patio del Leon and, built into a surviving Almohadic Wall, the Puerto del Leon, with its Christian azuelos (glazed tiles) ofa crowned lion.30 In the Alhambra itself, built by the Nasrid rulers from 1238 on, is the patio of the lions, constructed in the time of Mohammed V (1354-59 ).31 The twelve lions ofthe central fountain of this patio, each symbolizing the sun or source of life and together representing the suns of the zodiac, the months of which exist simultaneously in eternity, seem to be much older than the patio itself. They apparently come from the palace ofthe eleventh-century Jewish Zirid vizier, Yosef han-Nagid, the son of Samuel han-Nagid (993-1055/56).32 In Christian Spain the two most common representations seem to have been the guardian lion and the anthropophagous (androphagous), or man- eating, lion.33 Since ancient times the anthropophagous lion was seen as devouring man, transforming him in its stomach, and restoring him to new life. For Christians this was the perfect symbol of baptism, of the death of the old man and the birth of the new.34 But anthropophagous lions attack and devour men not gazelles. Only occasionally in the Christian north, as on an exterior capital at San Vicente de la Barquera, do we find something similar to?but later than?the basins of the South. At San Vicente, as at Granada, facing lions devour an animal rather than a man.35 Ofthe nature of things, such pictures are common across the cultures: the panels of a tenth-century Byzantine ivory box in the treasury of the cathedral of Sens have a lion attacking a sitting deer from above and behind and another lion doing the same to an ibex.36 Like most animals, lions could symbolize many things and any given lion more than one thing.37 (Of course, sometimes a lion was just a lion, as was the Cid's pet lion, who, escaping his cage at the beginning of canto 3 30Bohlen, 48-51, 54. 31Ibid., 282, 298-99.

The gazelle was much less common than the lion in ancient Mediterranean iconography and in the bestiaries. Because the Greek tragelaphos or Latin tragelaphus could designate either a fabulous beast or a type of gazelle or antelope,43 confusion exists about exactly what kind of animal the tragelaphos is?gazelle, deer, antelope, or goat. Representations ofa lion attacking a goat are very old, found in Sassanid art. An image of a lion attacking a gazelle appears on an eighth-century mosaic floor in Kirbat al-Mafjar, Palestine: while gazelles nibble leaves on the left side ofa large fruit tree, a lion attacks a gazelle on the right side. If Volkmar Enderlein's suggestion is correct, that we should "imagine the caliph enthroned above the tree" of this mosaic with the gazelles on the left symbolizing the world of peace and those on the right the world of war, we have a work with a number of analogies to both the Alhambra and Madrid basins.44 For our present purposes, the distinctions among the various animals that might be portrayed under attack?gazelles, antelopes, deer, goats? are unimportant because in Arabic and Hebrew poetic usage, to which we will shortly turn, all of them, especially deer, could signify the beloved.45 38This is also evidence that lions could be found in Europe at this time. 39Margaret Haist, "The Lion, Bloodline, and Kingship," in Debra Hassig, ed., The Mark ofthe Beast: The Medieval Bestiary in Art, Life, and Literature (New York, 1999), 3-21. 40Ignazio Malaxecheverria, Bestiario medieval (Madrid, 1986), 90. 41Voisenet, Betes et hommes, 57. 42Ibid., for Rabanus, and see 377-78. 43Ibid., 84. 44"Building Decoration," in Hattstein and Delius, eds., 80-87 at 87.

Replace the fruit tree of this mosaic with a tree of life and we are especially close to the subject matter ofthe Madrid basin.

In Christian literature the gazelle was among those animals of difficult or shifting classification, a composite "goat-stag" or "bad-stag," more at home in the world of men than of animals and incarnating the bad inclinations of Christians (Voisenet, Betes ethommes, 84). A Sudanese example ofa "stag" carrying a cross on his head, inevitably suggestive ofthe later iconography of Saint Hubert, may in fact use a gazelle instead ofa stag (ibid.).</page><page sequence="12">12 Glenn W. Olsen Islamic art had its own bestiaries, the hadices, which essentially repeated the bestial symbolism found in Christianity.46 Thus in both Islamic and Christian Spain the lion and the gazelle had at least partially overlapping symbolic meanings. However, there does not seem to have been a Christian usage parallel to Hebrew and Arabic in which the gazelle stood specifically for the object ofa dominating male's desire. It is to this we now turn. While a luxurious court life had begun to develop in the Arabian peninsula under the Umayyads,47 with the appearance in 750 ofthe Abbasid caliphate and its transfer to Baghdad, Arabic civilization underwent profound changes.48 An age of merchants and men of letters replaced an era of warriors and religious experts (ulama); a literature ofthe city displaced a literature of the desert. A desire for refinement, aimed at entertainment, swept through the Muslim world from Baghdad, the setting of A Thousand and One Nights. Books of erotology, the science of love, appeared, and adab literature, given over to music, dancing, and slave girls, spread as far as al- Andalus.49 Here the maqama genre and the vocabulary of love flourished. Hispano-Arabic and Romance poetry interacted, and the popular genre of the zajal treated erotic themes and what Francisco Marquez-Villanueva calls transgressive and devil-may-care sex.50 In addition, from the tenth through the fourteenth centuries, courtier rabbis and other Jews in Andalusia wrote in Hebrew a remarkably sensuous poetry ofthe gazelle.51 46Jesus Herrero Marcos, Arquitectura y simbolismo del Romdnico Palentino, 2nd ed.

From its beginnings in the ninth century, Arabic erotic poetry could often be crude and pornographic and could refer directly to consummation and specifically to anal intercourse.

In both Hebrew and Arabic poetry, a "gazelle" was a boy whose beard had not yet appeared.60 Thus the following lines of Ibn al-Abbar (1198-1260): No, the gazelle is no more handsome And his countenance, once like a moon, no more shines, A beard has appeared on his face, a blemish Which brought him death with no resurrection.61 While these lines were written in the thirteenth century, a large body of poems by male poets on the charms of boys had developed in Arabic literature from the Abbasid period.62 This and what is possibly the earliest 57Diwan, trans.

In his treatment of Spain, Boswell listed a number of mostly twelfth-century Jewish poets whom he described as having written "gay erotic verse."64 Although this label is anachronistic, these poets did write of love and desire of youths, sometimes within the norms of an elite class's vision of ideal beauty and sometimes, at least in Arabic verse, to scandalize the reader.65 Often the context of this poetry's recitation, whether Muslim or Jewish, was a wine party begun after dinner, attended by a servant, usually "a young boy trained to perform his office with flirtatious charm. When the function was performed by young girls, they wore their hair short and dressed like boys."66 There was presumably considerable sexual ambiguity here. The young boy or girl might be admired simply for his or her prepubescent beauty, which some might wish to label a form of androgyny But the ubiquitous category of "effeminacy" seems close at hand. This category, for all the civilizations discussed here, was rooted in the distinction between penetrat- ing and being penetrated sexually: it was masculine to penetrate, feminine to be penetrated.67 Within this framework, the cupbearer was often ad? mired for his "femininity," symbolized by his lack of facial hair and by the fact that he was available, "like a woman," for sexual penetration.68 Both Arabic and Hebrew gazelle poetry expressed a preference for young wine bearers of another religion than that ofthe drinkers, Muslims, for instance, preferring Christian or Jewish cupbearers.69 The "femininity ofthe gazelle" was thus tied to a quadruple submission that expressed the domination of old over young, male over female, free over slave, and Moslem or Jew over the religiously other. This was closely linked to the use of slaves for sexual 63Scheindlin, Wine, Women, and Death, 87, quotes what is possibly the oldest Hebrew example. 64Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, 233-34.

Olsen purposes in both Arabic and Jewish Andalusian households.70 Both cupbearer and slave, if indeed they were not the same, were, sexually speak? ing, fair game. One scholar, recalling Greek experience, has called the Hebrew poems a poetry ofthe "Ephebe."71 Since Boswell wrote, Raymond P. Scheindlin has continued to study the gazelle in Hebrew poetry, arguing that this poetry is not primarily about the experience of love or of an individual beloved but about the courtier class's ideal of beauty: "[T]hey used poetry to articulate their devotion to beauty as a cardinal value ofthe spiritual life. . . . [T]he object of the love poet's adoration . . . is not an individual but a shared experience. . . . [I]t is an esthetic rather than a loving experience."72 Roth disagrees, seeing in the poetry an expression of lived sexual experience, especially at the lower levels of society.73 Though these disagreements need not be resolved for the purposes of the present paper, in making their arguments Scheindlin and Roth are both right to note that much of this poetry does remind us ofa world going back to the Greeks.74 There can be no doubt, in the light of their studies, that a fawn or gazelle could signify the boy or youth in some form of pederastic relationship. 70Manuela Marin, "Marriage and Sexuality in al-Andalus," in Eukene Lacarra Lanz, ed., Marriage and Sexuality in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia (New York, 2002), 3-20 at 11, 13-14, 16-18, all on female slaves. 71J. Schirmann, "The Ephebe in Medieval Hebrew Poetry," Sefarad 15 (1955): 55-68. Roth, "'Deal gently,'" 30, and "The Care and Feeding of Gazelles," 114-15, disagrees with Schirmann's contention that none of this verse reflects personal experience. 72Scheindlin, Wine, Women, and Death, 85-89 at 85-86, and see 89: "Courtly Hebrew love poetry, like courtly Arabic love poetry, deals not with sex but with beauty. Its great innovation was not the introduction of homosexuality into its thematic repertoire, but the spiritualization of love itself, a truly Greek notion fundamentally at odds with both biblical and rabbinic thinking." 73Norman Roth, "'Fawn of my Delights': Boy-Love in Hebrew and Arabic verse," in Joyce E. Salisbury, ed., Sex in the Middle Ages: A Book of Essays (New York, 1991), 157-72, beginning at 159, takes issue with Scheindlin on a number of points but does not seem always to have read him carefully. This is part ofa larger dispute as to how much this poetry reflects actual sexual practice in medieval Spain (162-63). In arguing that there were few Jewish court poets and that most Hebrew poets of Spain were ofthe "'working class,' often desperately poor," Roth allows a number of tenth- and eleventh-century exceptions relevant to the present paper (161). In any case, I am not persuaded that he has dealt adequately with an obvious objection to his views, the constant mention of wine parties and cupbearers (= slaves) in Hebrew gazelle poetry, not things that one would readily associate with working- class origins. That said, I think Roth is correct in this article in criticizing a perceived tendency in Scheindlin to see too much of neo-Platonism in too much ofthe gazelle poetry. However, in overcorrecting Scheindlin's views he goes so far as to say that "love in our poetry was exclusively physicaf (165). The point I would insist on is the variety we find in this poetry, everything from ideal love to crudity. 74Scheindlin, Wine, Women, and Death, 68-71, 82-89, and The Gazelle, 91, 95, 250 n. 4; Roth, "'Deal gently'"; "The Care and Feeding of Gazelles," 96, 98-100, on the many shadings of love; and "'Fawn of my Delights.'"</page><page sequence="17">The Sodomitic Lions of Granada 17 In sum, Hebrew and Arabic erotic poetry featuring "gazelles" pro? vides a context for reading the sculpture ofthe basins of Andalusia.75 The argument is that at Granada?and elsewhere?the lion can evoke the man of high office who suborns and sexually dominates "gazelles," that is, "boys" or young men.76 Of several scholars who have studied the poetry ofthe gazelle, Roth especially has explored this, and a goal ofthe present essay is to refine and make more precise what he espied.77 Truth be told, Roth confused as well as illuminated the issue, apparendy because he did not actually view the basins under discussion here or refer to much ofthe then-existing art historical literature on them but relied for his understanding on a bewilderingly scrambled reading of Castejon's article. In any case, his pioneering study of the present article's topic gives a thoroughly confused description ofthe Alhambra basin.78 Perhaps because the Spanish word Castejon used in describing it was pila, Roth called the basin a pillar. Apparently confusing the Alhambra and Cordoba basins, he described the lions on the Alhambra basin as having heavy mustaches, thus indicating that they are, symbolically, dominant males in a pederast relationship. The lions on the Cordoban basin as well as others elsewhere do have mustaches, but the lions ofthe Alhambra basin, definitely males, have either thin mustaches or no mustaches at all but rather simply upper- lip lines that are being read as mustaches. Deciding whether one is looking at an upper-lip line or a mustache is often a problem in viewing lions; witness a Christian eleventh-century capital at Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire.79 Most grievously, Roth stated that the gazelles of the Alhambra basin, associated in his mind with the gazelles or beloved youths of Hebrew and Arabic verse, are being sexually "mounted" by lions ("the position ofthe animals certainly suggests sexual imagery"), whereas they simply are being 75Wright and Rowson, eds., provide an entrance into a very large subject that I can only hint at here. Schippers, 48-52, traces the origins of Hebrew Andalusian poetry and provides the most comprehensive study ofthe passage of genres and motifs from Arabic into Hebrew. The gazelle of secular erotic Hebrew poetry can appear also in religious verse; see Scheindlin, The Gazelle, 95. 76I have been unable to ascertain whether the Muslim tradition made explicit a connection between the royal ty ofthe lion and his pride. In the Christian tradition, the Latin Physiologus does not give pride as a characteristic ofthe lion, but this was emphasized in later bestiaries: Carmen Brown, "Bestiary Lessons on Pride and Lust," in Hassig, ed., 53-70 at 66 n. 29. Pride in the sense of "machismo" is related in many cultures to the man of station showing his manliness by suborning youths: see the treatment of Saint Pelagius in what follows. For Hebrew poetry, see Scheindlin, The Gazelle, and Wine, Women, and Death, and see Wright and Rowson, eds. 77Roth, "'Deal gently,'" "The Care and Feeding of Gazelles," and "'Fawn of my Delights.'" This latter article seems to begin with a misunderstanding of Plato but does note many parallels among Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew boy-love. 78Roth, "'Deal gentiy,"' 26. 79Raymond Oursel, Romanisches Frankreich: 11 Jahrhundert, trans.

There is no evident body contact other than the jaws and claws of lions on the necks and backs of gazelles, as would be expected in a hunting scene.80 Though I believe Roth was right to suggest that the Arabic and Hebrew poetry of love of boys provides a plausible context in which to view the Alhambra basin, his suggestion must be more conjectural than he indicates. It is based on a "misviewing" ofthe sculptural evidence, which through a language of "mustaches" and "mounting" attributed features to the "literal sense" ofthe basin that it does not have. I agree with Roth that a late- tenth- or early-eleventh-century viewer, especially one aware ofthe poetry of gazelles, could have made sexually symbolic associations when viewing the Alhambra basin; however, I must admit that there is little in the ostensible subject-matter of the basin, a hunting scene, to compel that viewer to do so. If the lions do not have mustaches, the scene before the viewer does not require that they symbolize dominant males, specifically the caliph himself; if the lions are not mounting the gazelles except in hunting, there is litde sexual innuendo to prompt the viewer to wonder if the gazelles are really stand-ins for the caliph's favorite boy(s). Boswell argued that from the late eleventh century some European (male) writers, at least as an act of the poetic imagination, expressed a conscious "personal" sexual orientation toward other males. One might debate from case to case how truly "personal" this was; one might argue rather that at least as often the preference expressed was, at one pole, for the shared vision of ideal beauty of some elite group or, at the other pole, for specific kinds of sex acts such as anal intercourse with youths.81 In neither case did "persons" necessarily stand to the fore. The language was often not of "sexual orientation," understood as permanent sexual preference for those of one's own sex, but was either a less specific language of desire for 80More likely candidates for presentation of "mounting" occur in later Christian art. A twelfth-century sculpture at Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul, Rosheim, in the Vosges Mountains, shows a lion with his paws on the shoulders of an apparentiy naked, bearded man, with the bodies of both positioned so that they could be in coitus. The man appears to be letting out a howl of pain: see Viviane Minne-Seve and Herve Kergall, Romanesque and Gothic France: Architecture and Sculpture, trans. Jack Hawkes and Lory Frankel (New York, 2000), 158? 59, with a picture and discussion ofthe possible theological meanings. Presumably completely by accident, there is a frieze at the nearby abbey of Andlau on which a lion kills a gazelle (160). Probably the symbolism at Rosheim is theological rather than sexual, about the struggle between good and evil rather than about anal penetration, but bearded men frequentiy embody hypersexuality in medieval thought, and the expression on the man's face is similar to one ofthe more likely presentations of anal penetration in Romanesque sculpture, on a cloister capital now in the Cloisters, pictured in Boswell, illustration 8. 81Of the many studies in which the discussion has continued since Boswell, see David M. Halperin, How to Do the History of Homosexuality (Chicago, 2002), 168-69 n. 43, commenting on my "St. Anselm and Homosexuality," Anselm Studies: An Occasional Journal!

To put this in categories that have become increasingly popular in scholarly analysis since Boswell's groundbreaking book and to which we have alluded, in the Roman, early medieval Christian, and Islamic worlds the emphasis, sexually speaking, was on the fundamental distinction between penetrating and being penetrated. We find something like this, therefore, in tenth-century Andalusia.84 Whatever else it was and whatever emotions accompanied it, human coition commonly involved domination or submission, especially the former, which could have "a thrill of its own." Coition, however, was not always the question, and, not surprisingly in a literature that has been thought by many to lie behind various medieval Christian ideas of courtly love, Hebrew and Arabic poetry often expressed a love centered on desire rather than consummation.85 Listen to Ibn cAmmar (ca. 1086), some years after the sculpting of our basins, threatening to blackmail al-Mu'tamid (ruled 1069-91) while being held in his prison: I see you ablaze with women's love. But I knew you of old to love men. . . . Do you remember our youthful days When you were like the crescent moon, When I used to embrace your slim figure And drink the nectar of your mouth, Content to keep to a sinless path, But you'd try your best to trespass into sin. I'll expose you little by little, Lift up the curtains one by one!86 82The language ofsodomy," derived as it is from the biblical city of Sodom, could have been found in Islam because of its reception ofthe Hebrew scriptures but so far as I know was not. However, see note 90 below. 83A long neck "like a gazelle's" was often spoken of in Arabic poetry as an attribute of female beauty. See Khadra Jayyusi, "Andalusi Poetry," 1:351. 84Monroe, "The Striptease," esp. 119-20. 85James T. Monroe, "Zajaland Muwashshaha: Hispano-Arabic Poetry and the Romance Tradition," in Khadra Jayyusi, ed., The Legacy of Muslim Spain, 1:398-419, thinks the differences between Arabic and Romance poetry greater than the similarities. Cf. in the same volume Roger Boase, "Arab Influences on European Love-Poetry," 1:457-82. Monroe, "The Striptease," treats the convention of unconsummated love. 86Trans.

Olsen These are the words of one who has known desire for another youth but claims to have respected Islamic strictures and not to have physically consummated this love.87 It is pretty clear, however, that Islamic law was often flouted, and one scholar, clearly with coition in mind, speaks of "homosexuality" as "rampant" in Andalusia, taking as her showpiece the poems of Ibn Shuhayd al-Andalusi (992-1035), who lived to see and write about the destruction of Medina al-Zahra.88 Particularly in response to this event, Ibn Shuhayd's poems were elegiac in tone and evoked a male world of friendship, erotic attachment especially to youths, and loyalty. It has been argued that Ibn Shuhayd himself expressed a personal preference for youths and not just for the easily available slave.89 When Boswell cast his eye on Muslim Spain, he, as some continue to do, called the poetry we have been examining and its authors homosexual. If we do not want to import this word with all its baggage from another age, and if we doubt that everything Boswell called homosexual should in any case be arranged under a single label, it is, nevertheless, very difficult to know how we are to proceed here. We might instead, as above, call the poetry and its poets pederastie, for in this poetry we often find adult men dominating and penetrating boys and youths. Thus James T. Monroe has written of "The [Arabic] Poet as Pederast," even arguing that the classical Arabic term liwat, which he takes "to be a back-formation based on the name ofthe prophet Lut ('Lot')," is equivalent to the Christian "sodomy."90 If meant as more than an analogy to one Greek usage, this terminology too is anachronistic and carries imprecisions of its own, but it is probably the best we can do. No labels are satisfactory. One historian of contemporary America, with an eye to modern psy? chological and legal literature, notes the availability of a distinction be? tween pedophilia, desire for children below the age of puberty, and ephebophilia, interest in youths about the age of puberty or older, from about fourteen to eighteen.91 For earlier periods, in addition to the in? trinsic problem of anachronism, use of such a term might imply a greater 87Pierre Cachia, "Andalusi Belles Lettres," in Khadra Jayyusi, ed., The Legacy of Muslim Spain, 1:307-16 at 312. Lois A. Giffen, "Ibn Hazm and the Tawq al-Hamama," in the same volume, 1:420-42, has very useful things to say about Islam and the poetry of love between men (433-35). For Jewish, Christian, and Islamic strictures against anal intercourse, see Schirmann, 63-65. 88Khadra Jayyusi, "Andalusi Poetry," 1:326, for the comment about "homosexuality," and 1:335-42 on Ibn Shuayd. 89Ibid., 1:339, 351. 90"The Poet as Pederast" is a subsection of Monroe's "The Striptease," 115-27, from which comes the phrase on Lut (116). Monroe's discussion of Arabic terminology is more helpful than his comments on Latin and Christian usage. Cf. Chebel, "Loth/Louthi/Liwat" and "Sodomie." 91Philip Jenkins, Pedophiles and Priests: Anatomy ofa Contemporary Crisis (New York, 1996), 7-8, 15-16, 77-80, 103-4, 163, 166.

The evidence considered in the present paper does not easily allow precise categorization, though after J. Schirmann's article on "The Ephebe in Medieval Hebrew Poetry," Roth subsequently noted that responsa (legal rabbinic) literature in Spain distinguished between a man having sex with a man and with an adolescent boy, assigning the death penalty to both parties in the former case and only to the adult male in the case of intercourse with a boy from nine to thirteen.93 In the case that we are about to discuss, Pelagius was ten years of age when first imprisoned by Abd al-Rahman III and thirteen when martyred for re? sisting the caliph's advances. If not always set in a court situation or addressed to a court audience, gazelle poetry, with its domination of a boy or youth by an adult male, might be said to depend on a dynamics, centering on a powerful man, typified by court life.94 This brings us back to the court at Cordoba.95 The sexually charged atmosphere of the tenth-century Cordoban court was famously caught, as Christian outsiders perceived it, in The Martyrdom of St. Pelagius. This was written by a Cordoban priest, Raguel, not long after the martyrdom of Pelagius about 925 and has been recently studied by Mark D. Jordan and translated by Jeffrey A. Bowman.96 No earlier scholar in the exchange of letters generated by this article Wills denies this (New Tork Review of Books, September 26, 2002: 86-89 at 86). Obviously, Jenkins's distinction is relevant to the question of whether there is a moral distinction between an adult male having sex with a child and with a youth: this distinction, some form of which was made by all medieval religious groups, in part feeds the controversy surrounding Jenkins. In the New Tork Review of Books, June 13,2002:12, writing in regard to the 2002 pedophile scandal in the American Catholic Church and saying that "one reason the hierarchy's defenders still rely on Jenkins's Pedophiles and Priests is that they like the book's distinction between pedophiles and ephebophiles," Wills somewhat misses or avoids the point that, whatever else it does, this distinction attempts to differentiate between "child abuse" and something more consensual, which in turn tends to draw "homosexuality" into the discussion. This is one of Kenneth Woodward's points in his letter in the New Tork Review of Books, September 26, 2002: 88- 89 at 89. See the entries "Ephebe," "Pederastie," and "Pedophilie" in Chebel. 92A study of medieval sodomy I am working on argues that, because no society has clearly fixed, stable boundaries separating the ages, stages, and terminology of sexual development and expression, the evidence will always resist a generalizing vocabulary. 93Roth, "'Deal gently,"' 22-23. Roth does not note that similar distinctions were common in early medieval Christian penitential literature. 94Hillenbrand, 1:125-27, effectively evokes the figure ofthe Cordoban caliph and the splendor of Medina al-Zahra. 95I have not been able to see Ann Christys, Christians in al-Andalus (711-1000) (Richmond, Surrey, 2002). 96Mark D.

Olsen seems to have seen the relevance of this document for drawing the picture ofthe environment in which our basins were sculpted and viewed. I close by introducing it into the discussion. Pelagius was offered at ten years of age to the Muslims as a substitute for his uncle, Bishop Ermogius of Tuy, whose health had deteriorated while he was held a war captive in a Muslim prison.97 Pelagius's captor, Abd al-Rahman III, the builder of Medina al-Zahra with its cult of the semisacred caliph, famously had created at Cordoba a court of great refinement, the locus in much medieval description of what we might call homoerotic sensibilities but that all sides in the tenth century linked to the "domination" of which we have already spoken, with its linked categories of "effeminacy" and "luxury."98 "Effeminacy" was but the bottom line in the logic of domination and submission already at the center of Roman life: an effeminate person of either sex was one who was, literally or metaphorically, "treated like a woman," penetrated in one sense or another by a dominator. A "luxurious" person was one who reveled in sensuality, again "like a woman," though?and this is a critical point for understanding the court at Cordoba?all through the Middle Ages, Western or not, effeminacy could be expressed in hypersexuality, roughly what we mean by calling someone oversexed.99 A famous, if contested, example of hypersexuality in the Christian world is Chaucer's Pardoner, whose "womanishness," it has been argued, includes (male) hypersexuality.100 Central here was the idea of abandonment ofa corrections ofthe former in the book I am preparing on medieval sodomy and ofthe latter in my review of Head's volume in the Catholic Historical Review 88 (2002): 109-15 at 111. The present treatment of Pelagius introduces dimensions of the question I did not have the space to address in my book review. Jordan's chapter is found in a revised form in Josiah Blackmore and Gregory S. Hutcheson, eds., Queer Iberia: Sexualities, Cultures, and Crossings from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance (Durham, N.C., 1999), 23-47. This latter book gives much contextual material on sodomy in Spain, almost all of which is after the period studied here, but see the passionately involved essay by Daniel Eisenberg, "Juan Ruiz's Heterosexual 'Good Love,'" 250-74 at 253-55.

Annie Shaver Crandell and Paula Gerson, with Alison Stones, The Pilgrim}s Guide to Santiago de Compostela: A Gazetteer (London, 1995), 218, gives a picture ofa relief at S.

F. Yeager and Charlotte C. Morse, eds., Speaking Images: Essays in Honor ofV.A. Kolve (Asheville, N.C., 2001), 411-44.</page><page sequence="23">The Sodomitic Lions of Granada 23 universally assumed stereotype of "maleness," defined by the idea that the proper male was rational and disciplined. In one way or another, ways that seem incompatible to most moderns, a man could become "feminine."101 He could move from the male standard by taking on either the penetrated status of a woman or the sexually hyperactive status of a man who does not discipline his sexuality, who penetrates beyond all reason, abandoning himself to passion. Abd al-Rahman III is presented by the priest Raguel both as a dominating = male predator of boys and as sunk, with his court, in feminine luxury or "softness," a representation that continues the ancient association of the East with effeminacy and luxury.102 Raguel's was the time ofthe royal favorite Ziryab, a poet from Baghdad who had become the arbiter of fashion in Cordoba, introducing toothpaste, underarm deodorant, short hairstyles, exotic cuisine, and the practice of changing fashion according to the season.103 There was good reason, then, for Christians to associate Abd al-Rahman with luxury Praised for his "beauty and charm" and brought after three and a half years in prison before the caliph "so that he might gaze at him," Pelagius was encouraged to deny Christ and offered "luxuries to szvor"104 Luxuria in medieval Christian thought was a sin in which effeminates languished, the context within which effeminacy flourished. When Abd al-Rahman attempted to grope Pelagius, the boy responded by calling him a dog and rejecting his advances: "Do you think me like one of yours, an effeminate?"105 Pelagius in effect was asking whether Abd al-Rahman thought that he could make Pelagius submit to him as he had made the other men ofhis court do. Such accusations were common and conventional but not for that reason necessarily ungrounded. An interesting question is whether the priest Raguel was aware ofthe body of Muslim gazelle poetry in which the love object was a Jewish or Christian boy. Did Raguel know that a standard tenth-century erotic tale in Arabic relates the story of a Muslim man who becomes infatuated with a Christian boy, and did such poetry or such a story have any influence on his presentation of Pelagius's life?106 Was Raguel aware ofthe convention ofthe Christian cupbearer = ephebe in the service ofa Muslim lord, and did he view Pelagius as on the precipice of being drawn into this ambience?107 To continue the story, 101See Roth, "The Care and Feeding of Gazelles," 115 n. 3, for further references on effeminacy in Andalusia. 102Mathew Kuefler, The Manly Eunuch: Masculinity, Gender Ambiguity, and Christian Ideology in Late Antiquity (Chicago, 2001), 47, and see 55-61 on the ancient association of "Unmanliness and the Love of Luxury." 103Hillenbrand, 1:117. 104Bowman, 228-29, 232-33. 105Ibid., 233, 235 n. 4, but I prefer the translation of Jordan, 13. 106Sprachman, as at 192; Roth, "'Deal gentiy,"' 30, 44. 107Schippers, 121.</page><page sequence="24">24 Glenn W. Olsen Abd al-Flahman had Pelagius dressed in fine clothes, but Pelagius took them off, a sign of his refusal to be sexually subordinated by a powerful man, a dominator of youths. The upshot was Pelagius's martyrdom at thirteen years of age, tortured in the most excruciating way, one limb hacked off after another. For our purposes, the point of the story is its perfect evocation of an atmosphere in which "lions" dominate "gazelles." In sum, for those with the eyes to see, that is, those conversant in Arabic and Hebrew poetry ofthe gazelle and with court life, the imagery ofa basin like that found at the Alhambra could well have been an expression not just or even mainly of an idealized form of love of boys but of a more sinister court atmosphere in which a caliph, while admiring youthful beauty, had his will with youths. The caliph was someone who could not be resisted without putting one's life in jeopardy. He was the lion who preyed on the gazelle. Raguel may have been an outsider to the life ofthe Cordoban court, but he was, nevertheless, a Cordoban and must have heard much about this life secondhand. An interpretation that sees such things in what seems at first viewing a hunting scene and then a symbolization ofa ruler's power and of hope for unending victory and prosperity through him can never be proved. Still, such an interpretation, at once fuller but more modest than that suggested by earlier scholars, fits the surviving evidence very well. The materials surveyed in this essay speak to several current questions in the history of male-male sexuality. One standing debate concerns the historical appearance of sexual identities, specifically whether before the development ofthe concept of homosexuality toward the end ofthe nineteenth century one can properly speak ofthe existence of either sexual orientation or sexual identity. Boswell held that "personal" sexual orientations existed in our period. What he meant by this shifted over the years but was related to his rather unpopular adherence to "essentialism." In the years since his book appeared, the discussion has become caught up in debates associated with the (also changing) views of scholars such as David Halperin about the historical emergence of sexual identities. A basic polarity here has been the contrast between a time?usually most of human history?in which sex acts were at the forefront of attention and a time?usually the period since the late nineteenth century?in which interest shifted from acts to actors, from something impersonal to something personal. The materials examined in this essay suggest that Boswell's "personal- ism," though not wrong, needs precision. In Spain around 1000, sexual preference seems to have expressed itself in a number of ways across a wide spectrum. Sometimes a specific person was desired, as "this boy." Some? times a representative ofa class of people was desired, as "a boy." Some? times an act was desired, as "anal intercourse." Sometimes something more</page><page sequence="25">The Sodomitic Lions of Granada 25 spiritual was intended, as "the beauty found by passing beyond all bodies." In much of this persons did not stand to the fore but rather objects ranging from ideal beauty to someone's rear end. Similarly, though language was not commonly about sexual orientation understood as permanent sexual preference for one's own sex, sometimes some such preference was ex? pressed. This seems related to the question ofthe existence of sexual iden? tities. In effect, to say "I prefer men/boys" is to think of oneself as, sexually, a certain kind of being. This does not mean that one necessarily sees oneself as centrally constituted or defined by this sexual identity; simply that, what? ever else one is, one sees oneself as having a sexual orientation or standing sexual preference. One might not have a word for what one is or even clearly think of oneself as belonging to some larger class constituted by sexual preference, but a certain sense of identity seems sometimes present. Like Abd al-Rahman, one could find the term "effeminate" hurled at one? self. We cannot say that in tenth- or eleventh-century Andalusia sex was simply about acts, preferences, or identities. All these seem in varying de- grees to have been present.</page></plain_text>
