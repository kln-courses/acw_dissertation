<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Atiqot 57, 2007 Local Glass Production in the Late Roman-Early Byzantine Periods in Light of the Glass Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana* Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson Preface Two salvage excavations conducted at Khirbat el-Ni'ana on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (henceforth IAA) uncovered large quantities of glass vessels in a fairly good state of preservation. The amount of glass, the various shapes, the quality and the fabrics called for further study of the finds, the results of which are hereby presented.1 The first IAA excavation season, carried out during July-August 1991 by Nitza Bashkin (1995), exposed an industrial area. The second IAA season, directed by Ofer Sion in late 1996early 1997 (see Sion, this volume), uncovered parts of a cemetery and remains of a pottery workshop dump. The lion^ share of the glass finds date to the fourth and early fifth centuries (all dates are CE, unless stated otherwise). While studying the glass from both excavations we realized that the material is very similar and that the vessels display distinct characteristics, suggesting they are the products of a local glass workshop. Furthermore, remains of glass production were discovered, mostly in the areas excavated in 1996-1997. Most of the glass was discovered in tombs, fills of industrial installations and dumps, limiting any stratigraphie contexts. However, the significance of the glass from the site lies in the assemblage attributed to a local glass workshop and its contribution to the study of ancient glass history. Most of the vessel types, generally attributed to a wide geographical region, are wellknown from collections, yet scarcely found in scientifically excavated sites. Therefore, mapping and dating local glass workshops (see below, Fig. 39) and their products may assist in tracing the origins of vessels from burial complexes, as well as those now located in museums. A review of the methodological research of glass workshops opens this paper, followed by a typological study of the glass vessels, small glass objects and glass production remains from each of the excavations, accompanied by illustrations and a catalogue of the finds. The glass finds from the 1996-1997 season are presented first, as they comprise a much larger corpus that is the foundation of this study. Vessel types discussed therein are merely recorded in the 1991 assemblage, yet other types, appearing only in the 1991 assemblage, are researched in detail. A few Late Islamic glass finds were retrieved from the latest phase of occupation at the site excavated in 1996-1997. They are presented separately in Appendix 1, as their forms, fabrics and techniques are very different from those of the early glass. Methodological Research of Glass Workshops Glass production involved two different processes: glass making, the primary stage in which chunks of raw glass were produced from the raw materials, and glass working, in which glass objects were made of molten *In memory of Michael Miles, our friend and colleague at the IAA glass department, who worked with us for ten wonderful years. Michael drew most of the glass finds from the IAA excavations, including those in this publication. As a draftsman Michael focused almost exclusively on glass, which he brought to life through his artistic talent. Michael's friendship and work will be cherished by us.</page><page sequence="2">74 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson glass. In the glass workshop artisans melted raw glass chunks and recycled glass sherds in small furnaces. They then worked the hot glass to form vessels and objects (Gorin-Rosen 2000a:50). The working area included the furnace, the glass-blower's working table, the blowing tools and the debris of the blowing process (Israeli 2003:94-97). Several glass workshops, dated from the Early Roman, Late Roman, Byzantine and medieval periods, have been uncovered during the past three decades in archaeological excavations in the western and eastern parts of the Roman Empire.2 The remains of these workshops corroborate the illustrated depictions of similar installations on Roman oil lamps and medieval manuscripts. These workshops also resemble traditional glass ateliers still functioning today in eastern Mediterranean marketplaces, e.g., in Hebron, Cairo and Damascus (for more information on traditional glassworking, see Nenna 2003). The archaeological evidence of a glass workshop rarely includes the furnace and the working area; generally it is the production debris that is discovered, either nearby or in a fill farther away from the workshop. The study of glass workshops suggests that piles of blowing leftovers could be discovered very close to the furnace, below the glass-blower's working station, whereas other wasters and raw materials may spread over a larger area. Therefore, it is not essential to find a furnace or glass debris in order to establish the existence of a local glass workshop. The sites of Jerash, Bazra and Suweida in Jordan and south Syria, for example, have yielded archaeological evidence of glass production, but so far no remains of furnaces related to glassmaking or glassworking (Dussart 2000:91). Several years ago Gorin-Rosen addressed the subject of glass workshops and suggested that a site may be identified as a production center if large quantities of similar vessel types are evident alongside production debris, although the original location of the workshop is unknown, as is the case at Khirbat el-Ni'ana (Gorin-Rosen 2000a:56, 58). Based on data accumulated from many recently excavated sites, it is now evident that large quantities of vessels of the same limited number of types sharing similar decorations, fabric and workmanship, are sufficient to determine the presence of a glass production center, despite the lack of furnace residue or glassworking waste. Occasionally, it is even possible to identify the fingerprints of a specific craftsman in particular features, such as the fashioning and application of handles or trails onto the vessels. We identified this phenomenon in many of the vessel types from Khirbat el-Ni'ana (see the typological discussion below). We also detected similar manifestations of a single artisan's traits in other glass corpora studied by us, from sites excavated in Israel during the past two decades, as well as other published examples, mostly from this country. The group most significant in this context is the one from the burial ground at Horbat Qastra, so far only partially published (GorinRosen and Katsnelson 1999; Gorin-Rosen 1998; Castra 1999; New Antiquities 1997). This group includes numerous jugs, ointment jars and perfume containers that exhibit the current trends in glassware of the fourth-fifth centuries (e.g., decoration with thick glass trails, depressions on the vessel body, ribbing of various types, typical trail handles), yet with a unique touch. This phenomenon was the focus of an exhibition of vessels from Horbat Qastra, as phrased in the catalogue: "Such a large concentration of identical vessels makes it possible to discern the particular features of the group and seems to indicate the existence of a local workshop. The finish of the vessels is not perfect, and the proportions—of the handles and bases, for example—are in some cases exaggerated. These features, along with the vessels' rather clumsy charm, undoubtedly reflect the particular style and taste of the master artisan of Qastra's glass workshop" {New Antiquities 1997:12). Another group of small jugs sharing similar characteristics was unearthed in Late Roman</page><page sequence="3">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 75 burials at Zippori in the lower Galilee, all probably produced in the same local workshop at the site (Israeli 2005:110*). A group of juglets from Burial Cave 2 at Khirbat el-Shubeika in the western Galilee displays a unique fashioning of the handles and trail decoration. The handles have an irregular cross-section, and the manner in which they are attached to the body (drawn upward and disconnected on the rim) is distinctive. Additionally, at least eight of the juglets exhibit a distinctive handling of an irregular, thick and coarse trail; the trail is attached to the body in a sloppy wedge-shaped blob and crookedly wound several times around the neck, occasionally overlapping the blob (Gorin-Rosen 2002b:307310־, Figs. 3, 4a). This particular treatment of the handles and trails may be identified as the individual imprint of a local glass blower. Another Late Roman group of juglets from the Tyre cemetery also bears distinctive features, different from those at Khirbat elShubeika; these include lack of decoration and careless execution, inattentive to details (Chéhab 1986: Pl. LVI-LVIII). Another group of vessels attributed to local production based on their shapes and fabrics alone, was discovered in burial caves at Horbat Rimmon in the southern Judean Shephelah (Gorin-Rosen 2004d:l 19*120־*). In some cases the fingerprints of a group or individual craftsmen were obvious and notable and pointed at a local manufacturer. This allowed the distinguishing of non-local vessels from local products, e.g., at the Late Roman glass factory at Jalame (Weinberg 1988) and the late Byzantine-Umayyad glass workshop in Beirut (Foy 2000:240-282). The discovery of many local workshops in Israel, as well as the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe, raises questions as to the interactions between them. When a specific type is detected in wide distribution, it may reflect one of several circumstances: mutual influences between regions and workshops, migration of artisans, a parallel or universal fashion, or a single center supplying all the merchandise. The latter alternative is the least probable during the Late Roman period, when glass manufacture centers flourished throughout the Roman world. Even high quality products were made in the periphery, such as the fine jugs that were produced contemporaneously in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Rhineland (Israeli 2003:185). Some of the vessels from Khirbat el-Ni'ana have parallels in a very wide geographical area. The bowls with a trail-wound base (Figs. 7; 31:1-5), for example, were collected at the site in rather large numbers and were produced locally. Many trail-wound bases were discovered in Israel and Jordan (see below). Numerous bases identical in shape, yet of brighter colors, were unearthed in north Sinai, along with remains of local glass production.3 Other examples were retrieved from Karanis, Egypt (Harden 1936: PI. 19:658), Carthage (Sternini 2000:140-141, Figs. 58-62; TattonBrown 1984:208, Fig. 68:103-105), Rome (dated to the mid-fourth and fifth centuries; Sternini 1995:249, PL 15:188-200; Sternini 2000:140), and southern France (dated to the fifth century; Foy 1995:196, PI. 7:40^13). It seems that vessels with a trail-wound base, as well as other types of vessels, were in vogue and widespread all over the Mediterranean during the fourth and fifth centuries, and were produced in many local glass workshops, such as the one at Khirbat el-Ni'ana. The local artisans followed the general fashion, using local fabrics and applying adornment to satisfy local tastes. We, therefore, suggest that during the Late Roman and early Byzantine periods several types of glass vessels were part of a universal trend, resembling that of the koine in earlier periods. On the other hand, some vessels attributed to the local glasswork at Khirbat el-Ni'ana convey a different pattern of distribution. These types appear mostly in sites in Israel, less frequently in the neighboring countries and are missing from European assemblages. One such example is the double kohl tubes (Figs. 17-21, and see</page><page sequence="4">76 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson discussion therein), abundant in Palestine in the Late Roman-Byzantine periods. The 1996-1997 Excavation Introduction A large amount of glass was unearthed during the excavation season conducted at Khirbat elNi'ana by Ofer Sion (this volume).4 More than 8000 fragments, including 20 complete and four intact vessels, were discovered in Areas 100 and 101, inside and outside the tombs. About half of the fragments were registered; others were too small to reconstruct their original forms. A summary of the quantities is presented in the following table: Area Total Glass Non-Diagnostic Registered Fragments Body Fragments Fragments 100 7026 3888 3138 101 1102 97 1005 The amount of glass finds discovered in this short-term salvage excavation is rather large. Yet, such richness is not surprising, considering the quantities of glass and remains of glass production collected in the 1991 excavation at the site (Bashkin 1995, and see below). Most of the glass finds are dated to the fourth and early fifth centuries. Two glass seals of the sixth-fourth centuries BCE, reused as jewelry, are the earliest finds (Fig. 24:3, 4 and see below). A few Late Islamic glass fragments are associated with the latest phase of occupation at the site (see Appendix 1). The Glass Vessels of the Late Roman and Early Byzantine Periods One hundred and thirty-three specimens were selected for presentation. These are the most diagnostic vessels and objects, representing the whole range of types of the Late Roman and early Byzantine periods uncovered at the site. The assemblage comprises tableware, cosmetic containers and oil lamps. All the vessels were blown, generally of bluish-green glass, ranging from nearly colorless to dark hues. Also frequent is green, occasionally with a yellowish tinge. A few colorless and purple pieces were also found. Some of the glass is streaked by yellow and red veins. Several vessels are decorated with trails, either blue and turquoise or of the same color as the vessel. The glass finds bear a silver layer of weathering and iridescence, and are generally covered with sand deposits. The glass is very bubbly with black impurities and deformations, the quality of the fabric is rather low and the vessels often display careless workmanship. The large quantity of glass fragments and their characteristic fabric and workmanship, as well as a rather limited number of types, suggest a local glass production. It is noteworthy that regardless of their provenance (inside and outside the tombs), almost all the vessels (as well as those discovered in the 1991 excavations) were produced in the local workshop. Since the glass collected in the tombs and in the surrounding area is chronologically homogeneous, it is hereby discussed typologically. Most of the parallels quoted are from sites in the Syria-Palestine region, assisting in establishing the chronology and geographical distribution of the various types. Some of the types from Khirbat el-Ni'ana also have counterparts in the western part of the Roman Empire, however, as we are dealing with locally produced vessels, it is irrelevant to the following study. Bowls Bowls with Rounded Rim (Fig. 1:1-5).— Numbers 1-5 belong to large open vessels, i.e., dishes or shallow bowls with straight or slightly slanted walls. The rims, thickened to varying extents, range in diameter from 200 to 240 mm. Several bowls have marks of exterior polishing on and below the rim. The walls are rather thin and delicate, some slightly bulging (Nos. 4, 5). These bowls usually have a pushed-in ring base. Bowls of this type generally date to the late</page><page sequence="5">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 77 1 \ / י::•־־••:'־ '::־•'':.־־a1 • -י-•.::; V Fig. 1.

Bowls with Rounded Rim and Horizontal Ridge (Fig. 1:6-9).— Bowls Nos. 6-9 have a shallow horizontal ridge below the rim and are distinguished by horizontal ridges forming a wavy wall. Number 6, a deep bowl with vertical walls, has a single horizontal ridge, located 8 mm below the rim; shallow bowl No. 7, with slightly curving walls, has two pronounced ridges. Bowls Nos. 8 and 9 have ridges just below their flared rims. Recent excavations demonstrated that these bowls were very frequent in the Galilee and were probably produced in the Jalame factory (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:45, 47, Fig. 4-6:49-64). Examples were unearthed in burial caves, mostly of fourth-century contexts, particularly in the western Galilee, e.g., at Kisra (Cave 3; Stern 1997: Fig. 2:12), near Kabri (Cave6; Stern and Gorin-Rosen 1997: Fig. 10:6, 7) and at H. Sugar (Cave 2; Gorin-Rosen 1997a: Fig. 5:3). Bowls of this type were also found on Mount Carmel, e.g., at Sumaqa, where they are thin and delicate as Nos. 8 and 9 (LehrerJacobson 1998:359, Fig. 1:2, 3) and at Raqit, where they are a little coarser (Lehrer-Jacobson 2003:233, Fig. 1:4-6). The bowls from Khirbat el-Ni'ana belong to the same type as those found elsewhere, yet they are distinguished by their delicate thin wavy wall and shallow ridges. Numbers 8 and 9 also display a thin delicate rim slightly bent outward. These minute differences</page><page sequence="7">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 79 may characterize the local workshop products that follow the traditional forms of the period, yet with a special touch.

Their diameters range from 150 to 280-300 mm. All known parallels have a low tubular ring base. Variants of shallow bowls with outfolded rims were unearthed at Jalame, within the remains of the factory dump dated to the second half of the fourth century (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:41-43, Fig. 4-3:14-19). Bowls with Outfolded Collar Rim (Fig. 2:4-9).— These deep and shallow bowls display versions of the collar rim. The rounded rim was folded outward and then back toward the wall, forming a heavy collar with either a thickened edge (Nos. 4-6) or two hollow folds (Nos. 7-9). Rim fragments resembling Nos. 4-7 are mentioned at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:49, Fig. 4-8:77-82). A deep bowl with an upright collar rim similar to No. 7 was found in Tomb XV at Hanita, dated to the third-early fourth centuries (Barag 1978a:21, Fig. 11:40). Fragment No. 8 belongs to a shallow bowl or plate with a wide splayed rim. Similarly shaped rims are common on very large dishes, like the well-known decorated plate from Catacomb 15 at Bet She'arim and two other plates from ElBassa, all dated to the late fourth century (for a full discussion of the type, see Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:49, Fig. 4-8:80, 81). The large shallow bowl, No. 9, has a wide upright collar, drawn from the rim down to the bottom of the wall and then folded at the edge. It belongs to a type, probably produced at</page><page sequence="9">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from khirbat el-Ni'ana 81 Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:47-48, Fig. 4-7:71-73). This type is most frequent in the Galilee, e.g., at Meron Strata IV (180-324 CE) and V (324-451 CE) (Meyers, Strange and Meyers 1981: Figs. 9.10:15, 16; 9.11:1-4), and in a fourth-century context at Kisra (Cave 3; Stern 1997:106, Fig. 1:6). Bowls with Double Fold Below Rim (Fig. 3).— These bowls were found at the site in many versions and relatively large numbers, and represent one of the most frequent types of the local production. A deformed rim of this type (Area 100, L9, B233, not illustrated) reinforces this assertion. Bowls of this type were also retrieved from the 1991 season (Fig. 28). Numbers 1-8 form a group of rather deep, small- and medium-sized bowls (rim diameters range from 90 to 140 mm), with convex or tapering walls. The complete vessel (No. 1), with its high, footed, pushed-in ring base, preserves the probable shape of the other bowls in this group. Number 9 and at least two more similar bases (not illustrated) from the site present another version of this base type. The rims are rounded and outsplayed to form a short shelf-like (Nos. 1-4), flared (No. 5), or upright (Nos. 6-8) rim. The most distinctive feature of these bowls is a double fold below the rim, formed as the rim was folded inward, upward and then downward. The location of the fold varies: it is either just below the rim (Nos. 1-5) or farther down the wall (Nos. 6-8). These bowls are often decorated with horizontal trails in turquoise or dark blue, applied and marvered-in at the top of the rim (Nos. 4, 5) or in between the folds (No. 5). ... . vSiWSSSW^MlSWjM 2 7 9 0 2 1 I ■WiUj■*™■ ־" י'־ '" Fig. 3.

The variations in shapes, fabrics and techniques, enable the dating of the whole group of bowls from Khirbat el-Ni'ana to the fourth century rather than earlier. A complete bowl with a rim like Nos. 2-4, a high tubular ring base and a body decorated with trails, was unearthed in Burial Cave 2 at Khirbat el-Shubeika and dated to the second half of the fourth century (Gorin-Rosen 2002b:304305־, Fig. 1:2, and see references therein). A rim from Ashqelon, resembling No. 4 in shape and decoration was dated by parallels to the thirdfourth centuries (Katsnelson 1999:67*, Fig. 1:1, and see discussion and further references therein). Various bowls with a similar double fold originated in the fourth-century fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem5 (Magen 2005: PI. 15:9-12), and in the Roman baths at Hammat Gader (Cohen 1997:401, PL 11:3). Several bowls of this type, including parallels to Nos. 2, 3 and 6-8, were discovered at Sumaqa and dated to the mid-fourth century (Lehrer-Jacobson 1998:360, Fig. 1:4, 5). Two bowls similar to Nos. 6-8 were found at Raqit (Lehrer-Jacobson 2003:233-234, Fig. 1:7, 8). The bowls with a double fold below the rim have various types of bases, all evident at the site. The most frequent is a high tubular ring base (Fig. 6:3-5), as the one on the complete</page><page sequence="11">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 83 bowl from Burial Cave 2 at Khirbat elShubeika (Gorin-Rosen 2002b:304-305, Fig. 1:2, and see above). Other variants are a high, footed, pushed-in ring base (Fig. 3:1, 9) and a trail-wound base (Fig. 7:6, 7). A complete deep bowl with a rim resembling No. 8 and a trail-wound base, currently in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, is allegedly from Toobas, Syria and dated to the second half of the fourth century (Fleming 1999:95, Fig. E.44). Deep Bowl with Flared, Cut-Off and Ground Rim (Fig. 4:1).— This hemispherical bowl has a band of horizontal incisions on the wall and a single thin wheel-cut groove farther down the body. It probably had a rounded bottom with no distinctive base. This type of bowl is dated to the Late Roman period and may have also served as an oil lamp. A shallow version of this bowl was found in the 1991 season (Fig. 29). Several bowls of this type were discovered in the glass factory dump at Jalame, dated to the second half of the fourth century (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:94-96, Fig. 4-49:477-480). Undecorated pieces were unearthed at the 'Dominus Flevit' compound on the Mount of Olives (Bagatti and Milik 1958:148, Fig. 35:18), Sumaqa (Lehrer-Jacobson 1998:359, Fig. 1:1) and the Late Roman winepress at Akhziv (Syon 1998: Fig. 14:3).

Many plain and decorated bowls of this type were excavated in Beirut, dated to the fifth century (Jennings and Abdallah 2001-2002:242, Fig. 6:11-17) and in Jordan, dated from the fourth to the early sixth centuries (Dussart 1998:61-62, Types BI.221, BI.222, PI. 4:22-31). Bowls with Thickened Rounded Rim (Fig. 4: 2, 3).— The rims are rounded and have polishing marks on the exterior. Number 2 has an upright rim, while No. 3 has a flared one. These bowls probably had thickened, concave and flattened bottoms like Fig. 5:3, 5. They are assigned to the Late Roman-early Byzantine periods. Published parallels are rare. The upper part of a bowl of this type, identified as an oil lamp, was found in a context of the fifth-seventh centuries in the northern church at Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Patrich 1988:139, Fig. 14:32). Asmall complete bowl, probably of the same type, came from Tomb 295 at Bet She'an, dated to the mid- or late fourth century (Fleming 1997:31, Fig. 14). Similar shallow and deep bowls with thickened concave bottoms, discovered at Hammat Gader, were dated, probably erroneously, to the eleventh-twelfth centuries (Cohen 1997:400, PI. 1:8, 9). Several vessels similar in shape and fabric, yet with folded rims, were unearthed in a Byzantine context at Caesarea.6 Despite their scarcity among corpora published so far, these bowls were widespread and occasionally appeared in rather large quantities, for example in another assemblage from Caesarea.7 Judging by their fabric and workmanship, it is plausible that the bowls with a thickened rounded rim were made in the local workshop. Bowls with Multiple Wound Trails On and Below Rim and Flat Bottom (Fig. 5:1-5).— These bowls display forms resembling their contemporary undecorated counterparts (Fig. 4:2, 3). Numbers 1-3 have a flared rim, while No. 4 has an upright rim. They are all decorated with an applied blue trail, closely wound several times around the rim and below it. Bowls with this type of trail-decoration were widely distributed. Most of the parallels come from southern Israel, e.g., two bowls with flared rims resembling Nos. 1-3 fromAshqelon (Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004:100-102, Fig. 1:5, 6) and several variations of trailed bowls from Mezad Tamar, dated to the late fourth century (Erdmann 1977:107, Pis. 5:515, 523; 6:569,581). Other examples were found in contexts of the fourth-fifth centuries at the 'En Boqeq fortress (Gichon 1993:435, Fig. 60:21), and in the early Byzantine levels (Phases I, II) at 'Ein ez-Zâra, Transjordan (Dussart 1997:98, PI. 24:6). Also from Jordan are a rim like No.l and a bowl resembling No. 3, both from fifthcentury contexts at Petra (Keller 2006:206-207, Pl. 9:g, 1). Bowls with trails of varied colors marvered-in below the rim were also collected from the Byzantine cemetery church at Horbat Karkur 'Illit in the northern Negev (Katsnelson 2004:266-267, Fig. 58:6-9). Farther north, two trail-decorated bowls, one resembling Nos. 1 and 2, and the other similar to No. 3, but with a wide, shelf-like rim, were found at Horbat Nashe in the western Samarian foothills and dated to the Late Roman-Byzantine periods (Jackson-Tal 2004: Fig. 58:2,3). A small complete bowl, with a rim like Nos. 1 and 2 and a bottom resembling Nos. 3 and 5, was unearthed in a burial cave of the fourth-sixth centuries at Kafr 'Ara (Sussman 1976:99, Fig. 4:10). An upright rim resembling No. 4 and decorated with dark blue trails was discovered at Raqit on Mount Carmel (LehrerJacobson 2003:233, Fig. 1:1). Several variants of similarly trailed bowls were discovered in the Jalame factory dump, dated to the second half of the fourth century, as well as randomly around the site (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:55-56, Fig. 4-17:129-130). Numbers 3 and 5 display the bottoms of these trail-decorated bowls. A similar bottom was recovered at Horbat Karkur 'Illit (Katsnelson</page><page sequence="13">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 85 S-VrWr- '11: '.-.&lt; Vi*Mis yy'vi:vw15'w5&gt; 0 2 1 I Fig. 5.

Bowl No. 7 is also decorated with shallow ribbing on the body. No published parallels were found. Bowl with Mold-Blown Decoration (Fig. 5:9).— This bowl is decorated only on the body with pronounced mold-blown horizontal ribbing. This design is quite frequent on closed vessels of the Late Roman-Byzantine periods, but rather rare on bowls. A few examples have been recently published, e.g., a bowl from Ashqelon decorated with slanted ribs (Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004: Fig. 1:8), and a vessel with mold-blown diagonal ribbing, from the Byzantine cemetery church at Horbat Karkur 'Illit in the northern Negev (Katsnelson 2004: Fig. 61:11). Bowls with Pushed-In Hollow Ring Base (Fig. 6).— These are variants of ring bases that probably belonged to bowls resembling those in Figs. 1-3. Numbers 1 and 2 are of the low ring base subtype, while Nos. 3-7 are of the higher subtype. The bottom, thickened at the center, was pushed-in and a hollow ring, in varied shapes and heights, was tooled out.

At least two more low ring bases and 15 more high pushedin ring bases (not illustrated) were collected at the site. Four pushed-in, hollow ring bases of various sizes, including parallels for Nos. 3-6, were unearthed in a burial cave of the fourth-sixth centuries at Kafr 'Ara (Sussman 1976:99, Fig. 4:12-15). Similar bases were found at Raqit on Mount Carmel among other vessels dated mostly to the fourth-fifth centuries (Lehrer-Jacobson 2003:233, 237, Fig. 3:1-5, 10). Late Roman examples of complete bowls with this type of base were discovered in Tomb XV at Hanita (Barag 1978a: Figs. 6:5; 7:9, 10; 10:34; 11:44, and see further discussion and references therein).

The floors of these bases are more or less flat (Nos. 15־) or convex (Nos. 6, 7). The number of coils ranges from two to five and the diameters from 54 to 70 mm. The bases are made of glass in combinations of green, yellow or greenish-blue; occasionally, the body and base are made of different tinges of the same color. The bases from the 1996-1997 season at Khirbat el-Ni'ana probably belonged to bowls, judging by their large size and the angle of the wall fragments that survived.8 Moreover, most of the trail-wound bases from the 1991 excavation at the site were clearly identified as bowls (Fig. 31:1-5), bar Fig. 31:6 that may have also belonged to a jug or flask. The published excavated specimens encompass a wide area: several trail-wound bases from the Byzantine fill of the Roman painted tomb at Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:69*-70*, Fig. 2:3); a base from 'En Gedi (Jackson-Tal 2005:77*, Fig. 2:8); two bases from Jerusalem—one from a dwelling cave on the Mount of Olives (Winter 2000: Fig. 10:4), and another, belonging to a handled-jug of the fourth to the early fifth centuries, from Area W in the Jewish Quarter excavations (GorinRosen 2003:387-388, PI. 15.9:G 104); a few trailed bases from Shekhem—a fourth-century group from a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, and a base from the amphitheater (Magen 2005: Pis. 18:6-10, 52:7); a base with two wound trails from Khirbat Badd 'Isa (Qiryat Sefer) (Magen, Tzionit and Sirkis 2004:216, PI. 9:22); a base fragment from the Red Tower (al-Buij alAhmar), found in the Byzantine Phase B dated to the fifth-sixth centuries (Pringle 1986:161, Fig. 52:6); a piece from Horbat Nashe in the western Samarian foothills (Jackson-Tal 2004: Fig. 58:4); similar bases, probably of bowls, from Sumaqa, dated to the fourth century (Lehrer-Jacobson 1998:361, Fig. 1:13, PI. 6:a); and a base attributed to a jug from Raqit (LehrerJacobson 2003:240-241, Fig. 7:14). Several complete jugs and head-flasks with trail-wound</page><page sequence="18">90 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson bases were uncovered in tombs at Horbat Qastra9 and at Tirât Karmel.10 A few pieces were excavated in Jordan, e.g., bowl fragments dated to the fourth-fifth centuries from 'Ein ezZâra (Dussart 1997:102, PI. 29:2a, b) and "coil bases" from 'Iraq el-Emir (Lapp 1983:51, 58, Fig. 24:15). The trail-wound bases were uncovered at Khirbat el-Ni'ana in large numbers compared with other sites, indicating they were locally manufactured at the site. Furthermore, a salvage excavation at Khirbat el-Fatuna (near Yavne) yielded numerous bases of this type, together with remains of a local glass industry." It can therefore be established that several vesseltypes with a trail-wound base were produced in local glass workshops in the region during the Late Roman-Byzantine periods.

Nos. 157, 158). Conical beakers were used as lamps, as evident on the mosaic floors of the synagogues at Bet She'an and Hammat Teveriya (Tiberias), in which conical beakers are depicted set on menorah branches. Corroboration for their use as lamps also comes from the oily residue preserved inside conical beakers from Karanis (Stern 2001:268, and see further references therein; Israeli 2003:193). Conical beakers also served as drinking vessels, as indicated by a wall painting from a fourth-century tomb at Ostia (Fleming 1997: Fig. 18). Additionally, a conical beaker, a flask and a jug are depicted under an arch, engraved on the large glass plate from Bet She'arim, suggesting that these vessels were used in ceremonial rituals (Israeli 2003:193; Fleming 1997:30-33). About a hundred fragments of conical beakers were collected at Jalame, mostly from the glass factory dump (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:87-94, Fig. 4-46, and see therein discussion of the type, its function and technique). Consequently, it was established that at least this one local glass workshop in Palestine produced conical beakers. Furthermore, recent publications introduced fragments of conical beakers from two fourthcentury assemblages, one from Khirbat Badd 'Isa (Qiryat Sefer) (Magen, Tzionit and Sirkis 2004:216, PI. 9:23), the other from a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem; the latter includes a rim resembling No. 1 and pieces decorated with blobs (Magen 2005: PI. 17:5, 7, 10-12). Several decorated beakers were sealed in a late fourth-century cistern at Bet Guvrin.12 Others were uncovered in the Roman baths at Hammat Gader (Cohen 1997:408, PI. 3:6). The excavations at Banias also yielded conical beakers: a complete specimen from the</page><page sequence="21">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 93 Pan sanctuary and another from the "Street of Shops" (Gorin-Rosen 2001:69, Cat. Nos. 113, 117).13 Another piece was discovered at Horbat Manot in the western Galilee and dated to the fourth century (Yeivin 1958). Two conical beakers decorated with blue and turquoise blobs, now in the Israel Museum collections, were purchased in northern Israel and probably originated from the same site (Israeli 2003:195, Cat. Nos. 229, 230, and see further discussion and references therein). Conical beakers were also unearthed in Jordan, e.g., at 'Ein ez-Zâra, Bozra and Petra (Dussart 1998:78-79, Type BVI.llllal, BVI.lllla2, PI. 13:1-5; Keller 2006: Pis. 3:1, m; 13:h, i). Beakers with Solid Base (F ig. 8:3-9).— Besides the specimens herein presented (Nos. 3-9), at least ten more beaker bases (not illustrated) were unearthed at the site. Number 3 represents the upper part of the vessel with a rounded rim and an applied horizontal trail below it. The body is generally cylindrical. Numbers 5 and 6 reveal evidence of the manufacturing process: the base was applied when the hot solid gob of glass was pressed against the bottom of the beaker. Beakers of this type were widespread in northern Israel, as well as other regions. They were a major product of the Jalame glass factory, dated to the second half of the fourth century (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:60-61, Fig. 4-23, and see full discussion therein). The beakers with a solid base discovered in Israel provide firm dating to the fourth century and are found at nearly every excavation incorporating a phase from this period conducted in the country in the last two decades. Beakers of this type were published, e.g., from a fourth-century winepress at Akhziv (Syon 1998:95-96, Fig. 15:1-5), Giv'at Yasaf (Gorin-Rosen 1999:137-138, Fig. 1:1), and the Roman baths at Hammat Gader (Cohen 1998: PI. 111:14-19). Solid bases were discovered, e.g., at Caesarea (Peleg and Reich 1992: Fig. 18:16), Shekhem (Magen 2005: PI. 18:14, 15), Sarafand el-Kharab, Nes Ziyyona (Gorin-Rosen 2004c:59-60, Fig. 1:1), Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:69*, Fig. 2:2) and 'En Gedi (Jackson-Tal 2005:77*, Fig. 2:11, 12). This type of beaker was also widespread in modern-day Jordan, e.g., at Jerash, 'Ein ez-Zâra, 'Amman and Bozra (Meyer 1988:193, Figs. 6:Z, 7:A, B; Dussart 1998:96-98, Type BVIII.121, PI. 21:18-41). The large quantity, the fabric and the workmanship of the bases from Khirbat elNi'ana may point to a local production. Beaker or Flask with Solid Flat Base (Fig. 8:10).— This flat base, thickened at the center, belonged to a rather large beaker or flask, probably with a conical body. A two-handled flask with a similar base was unearthed in Burial Cave 3 at Horbat Rimmon (GorinRosen 2004d:119*-120*, Fig. 3:24) and may have been produced at the local workshop there. Beakers with Pushed-ln Base (Fig. 8:11—15).— These pushed-in bases with hollow rings frequently held various Late Roman beakers and jugs (Magen 2005: PI. 18:16-21). Beakers with this type of base were collected at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:62-63, Fig. 4-24:187-192, and see discussion and references therein, including an example from Samaria). Jugs—some of them complete—with similar bases were found in large numbers at Horbat Qastra (Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 1999:27*, Fig. 51, Color Plate iii:6, 9), and at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:65, 68, Fig. 4-29:242-244, and see discussion therein). Pushed-in bases of this type were also unearthed in the fourth-century winepress at Akhziv (Syon 1998:95, Fig. 15:23, 24). Wineglasses (Fig. 8:16,17).— These specimens have a hollow ring base: No. 16 with a solid stem and No. 17 with a beaded stem. These footed bases belonged to wineglasses with rounded rims, often trailed. They are generally dated to the Byzantine period, similar to the ones from Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:70*-71*, Fig. 2:9-14). Two similar bases, dated to the late</page><page sequence="22">94 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson Byzantine period, were discovered at Khirbat Tabaliya (Giv'at Ha-Matos), Jerusalem (GorinRosen 2000b:84*-86*, Fig. 2:14, 15, and see further references and discussion therein). Jars Small Jars (Fig. 9).— The 1996-1997 season yielded ten small cosmetic jars: five complete, plain and decorated jars presented below (Nos. 1-5; see also Flebrew Cover), and five identical jars (from L44, not illustrated). The vessels are relatively small (60 to 80 mm high) and have a rounded rim and a wide funnel-shaped mouth. Their bodies are rounded or squat and the bottoms are concave, bearing a pontil scar. The jars, bar No. 1, are decorated with horizontal collar folds at the neck (Nos. 2,4, 5), indents on the body (Nos. 3, 5), or a combination of both (No. 5). The jars are characterized by careless workmanship: sloppy and irregular upper parts (Nos. 2-4) and irregularities in the decorations. The color scheme of these jars is striking, especially compared with the rest of the assemblage. Three of the jars (Nos. 1, 2, and 5) are purple while the others are of light bluish-green (No. 3) and yellowish glass (No. 4). Among the five non-illustrated jars, two are yellowish-brown and the others are yellowishgreen, light green and bluish-green. The small cosmetic jars belong to a wellknown group of vessels, prevalent in burial complexes of the late third to the early fifth centuries in Syria-Palestine (Barag 1970:148-155, and see full discussion therein). This group is rich in variations of shapes, handles and decorations, and several variants of the type were often discovered together (see references below).

A small jar resembling No. 3, but with an infolded rim, and another jar with a collar fold like on No. 4, were discovered in a tomb at Beit Fajjar (Husseini 1935: PL 85:5, 8), dated by Barag (1970:150) from the mid-fourth to the mid-fifth centuries. Two jars resembling No. 3 in shape and decoration, and another jar, very similar to No. 5, were unearthed in a burial cave at Kafr 'Ara, dated by parallels to the late third-fourth centuries (Sussman 1976:99, PI. 28:3-5). Several larger, coarse jars, similar to Nos. 2-5, were found in Tomb 200 at Giv'at Sharet, Bet Shemesh, dated from the last quarter of the fourth to the first quarter of the fifth centuries (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:50,59, Fig. 15:2—4). Another example, similar to No. 4, came from Tomb 201 at Gezer (Macalister 1912: PL 119:5), dated by Barag to the late fourth or early fifth centuries (Barag 1970:154, Type 6:18). The largest group of similar jars, unearthed in a burial complex near Kibbutz Palmahim,14 was dated to the late fourth-early fifth centuries (Gorin-Rosen 1998:20, top photo, the two vessels on front right).

Numbers 8 (see also English Cover: right) and 9 share similar features with Nos. 1-7 and also have a handle that identifies them as juglets. The rounded handles (on No. 9 only the base of the handle survived) are irregular and too massive in relation to the body. Several additional vessels of this type were discovered in both the 1996-1997 (not illustrated) and the 1991 seasons (Fig. 33:4-10). Vessels Nos. 1-9 seem to have been made locally on account of their shape, color scale, low-quality fabric and the large quantity from both excavations at the site (Fig. 33:4-10). A few deformed rims of this type (not illustrated), possibly production waste, also support a local origin for these vessels. Two bottles with a constricted neck were discovered in the cemetery at Horbat Rimmon; they were assigned to a local workshop, based mainly on their fabric and on the entire assemblage, as well as on their resemblance to the group from Khirbat el-Ni'ana (Gorin-Rosen 2004d: 117*).</page><page sequence="26">98 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson Bottle No. 3 belongs to this group, yet differs slightly with the horizontal ridge below its rounded rim. A bottle with a similar rim was unearthed in the 1991 season (Fig. 33:13). A vessel with a constricted neck and a similar ridge, created by a partly open fold below the rim, was discovered in Burial Cave 3 at Horbat Rimmon, dated to the Late Roman period, particularly the fourth century (Gorin-Rosen 2004d:117*-123*, Fig. 3:13). Another bottle of this type was unearthed in Burial Cave 121 at the 'Dominus Flevit' compound in Jerusalem (Bagatti and Milik 1958: Fig. 33:12). A bottle with a trailed rim and a constricted neck was found in the northern cemetery at Samaria and dated to the fourth and fifth centuries (Crowfoot 1957:412, Fig. 95:12, and see therein two examples from Jerusalem). Another example came from the Roman baths at Hammat Gader (Cohen 1997:427, PL 8:1). This type of constricted neck was common in the Late Roman period in the Near East, mostly in Egypt, often on larger and decorated vessels. Many variants were excavated at Karanis, in houses dated later than the year 300 CE (Harden 1936:186, PL 17:516, 533, 537). Based on parallels from Karanis, Crowfoot (1957:412) proposed that the bottle from Samaria (mentioned above) was "probably an Egyptian import". Barag suggested the same, as vessels of this type had rarely been published at the time from sites in Israel (Barag 1970:201, Type 16:9-1, PI. 44:9-1). However, we are now convinced that this type of bottle with a constricted neck was locally manufactured; it does bear some characteristics that are also familiar among Egyptian glassware, but the fabrics are different, indicating that the vessels were produced in distinct local glass workshops in Palestine and Egypt (see below, discussion on mutual influences and universal fashion). Bottles and Jugs with Funnel-Shaped Mouth (Fig. 11).— This group of bottles and jugs belongs to rather familiar types of the Late Roman and early Byzantine periods, and includes several subtypes, varying in size, rim shape and decoration. Most of the specimens from Khirbat el-Ni'ana are small and mediumsized. The vessels are generally characterized by a cylindrical neck, a funnel-shaped mouth, a piriform or cylindrical body and a concave or pushed-in hollow ring base. Numbers 1-4 have an infolded rim and a short funnel-shaped mouth. Vessels of this type were discovered at Jalame, in the factory dump dated to the second half of the fourth century and in pre-factory contexts (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:72, Fig. 4-33:284-288). Bottles resembling Nos. 1 and 2 were unearthed in the fourth-century fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem (Magen 2005: PI. 19:12-15). Number 3 is decorated with an applied trail below the rim; a similar rim was found in the Late Roman winepress at Akhziv (Syon 1998: Fig. 15:19). Number 4 also has a trail handle, identifying it as a jug. Similar jugs were uncovered in various excavations at Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:72*—73*, Fig. 3:6, 7; Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004: Fig. 2:3). Numbers 5-7 have a rounded rim and a short funnel-shaped mouth with a single wound trail. This type of rim may belong to bottles (Nos. 5, 6) or jugs (No. 7). The strap handle of No. 7 is typical of these jugs, resembling those from Burial Caves 2 and 3 at Kisra, dated to the fourth and early fifth centuries (Stern 1997:112-114, Fig. 5:22, 24). Bottles with a funnel-shaped mouth and a single trail were discovered, e.g., at Jalame, mostly in the factory dump (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:69-70, Fig. 4-31:262-263), and in Burial Cave 3 at Kisra (Stern 1997:110-111, Fig. 4:17). A jug with a rim like No. 6 and a neck resembling No. 8 was also found at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:64-67, Fig. 4-28:217). A few bottles with rims resembling Nos. 5-7 were unearthed in the fourth-century fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem (Magen 2005: PI. 19:7-9, 11 ). Rims such as Nos. 6 and 7 were recovered at 'En Gedi (Jackson-Tal 2005: Fig. 3:10, 11). Number 8 displays a neck fragment of a bottle or jug decorated with a single trail on its funnel</page><page sequence="27">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 99 V t 15 ז 0 2 1 I Fig. 11. Bottles and jugs with funnel-shaped mouth. shaped mouth and another trail wound around the lower part of the neck. A similar jug was found in the Late Roman winepress at Akhziv (Syon 1998: Fig. 15:20). Number 9 has a rounded rim and a short thin-walled funnel-shaped mouth; No. 10, similar in shape though slightly larger, has a thin trail wound several times below the rim and on the mouth and neck. A bottle with its trail wound like No. 10 was found in the fourth century fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem (Magen 2005: PI. 19:10). Bottles with a rounded rim and a funnel-shaped mouth were common in the Late Roman period, e.g., the piece from Burial Cave 1 at Kabri, dated to the third-early fourth centuries (Stern and Gorin-Rosen 1997:14-16, Fig. 8:16). Jugs with a rounded rim and multiple wound trails were also unearthed at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:64-66, Fig. 4-27:208, 211).</page><page sequence="28">100 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya katsnelson i Fig. 11 No. Loc.

Both are characterized by an uneven, unfinished rim with a fire-rounded edge. The complete bottle resembles other large and medium-sized bottles from the site. These bottles support the concept of local production and demonstrate, with their incomplete or crooked rims, how the same workshop may yield some unsuccessful vessels alongside the fine pieces. Moreover, the malformed vessels may have been sold as poor quality, second-rate products. Large Bottles with Rounded Rim and FunnelShaped Mouth (Fig. 13).— These bottles generally have a cylindrical and rather tall neck, a large squat (No. 1) or cylindrical (No. 2) body, and a concave bottom with no pontil mark (Nos. 1, 2). The height of the bottles ranges from 180 to 240 mm. They differ from those mentioned above (Fig. 11:5, 6) by their size and workmanship. The bottles are decorated with applied horizontal trails on the mouth.

A trailed bottle, very similar to No. 2, was unearthed in a fifth-century tomb at KafrDikhrin (Rahmani 1964:52, Fig. 2:1, and see therein example from Jerash, dated to the fifth and early sixth centuries). Another bottle of this type was uncovered in the Byzantine fill of the Roman painted tomb at Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:74*, Fig. 4:2). Bottles with decoration resembling Nos. 3 and 4 were found at Ashqelon (Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004: Fig. 2:4, 5). A bottle with densely wound trails like No. 5 was unearthed in the fourth-century fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem (Magen 2005: PI. 19:18). The large number of vessels, the quality of the fabric and the style of trail winding all attest to these bottles being locally produced at the site.

The body may be piriform (No. 4) or squat (Nos. 3, 8), and the bottom is generally concave (Nos. 3, 4, 8). Numbers 6 and 7 are decorated with mold-blown ribbing. Several more bottles of this group (not illustrated) were unearthed at the site: three similar to No. 1 ; two, as well as a few specimens from the 1991 excavations (Fig. 35:1-3), resembling No. 3; and a large bottle identical to No. 8. These types of bottles were frequent in the region during the Byzantine period, particularly in the fifth-sixth centuries. The bottles bearing mold-blown decoration belong to types that continued into the late Byzantine and early Umayyad periods, as attested, e.g., by examples</page><page sequence="34">106 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya katsnelson from Jerusalem (Gorin-Rosen 2000b:87*, trailed: Fig. 2:18, mold-blown: Fig. 2:19). Bottles of these types were discovered in burial complexes, as well as settlements. Bottles resembling Nos. 1 4־ were found in the Byzantine fill of the Roman painted tomb at Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:73*74־*, Figs. 3:8-15, and see therein further references to bottles from burial contexts in and around Jerusalem). Another site at Ashqelon also yielded similar vessels, including bottles such as Nos. 1 3־ (Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004:105-106, Fig. 2:6, 8, and see further references and discussion therein). A bottle decorated with mold-blown ribbing similar to No. 6 was found in a rectangular built tomb at Ashqelon, dated to the fourth-fifth centuries (Gorin-Rosen 2002c: Fig. 136:6) and in another site at Ashqelon (Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004:105-106, Fig. 2:13, 14). Another bottle resembling No. 6 was unearthed at 'En Gedi (Jackson-Tal 2005:77*-78*, Fig. 3:2). Two bottles bearing vertical mold-blown ribbing as on No. 7 were uncovered in the 1991 excavations at Khirbat el-Ni'ana (Fig. 35:5, 8). Despite the scarcity of the pieces, the characteristic shape, decoration and fabric of these bottles may point to a local production. Spouted Bottle (Fig. 14:9).— This bottle is characterized by an upright rim, a long cylindrical neck slightly tapering downward, and a globular body with a spout applied to it. The shape of the vessel and its fabric assign it to the local glass repertoire, although only this spouted specimen was retrieved from the 1996-1997 excavation, and only two were discovered in the 1991 season (Fig. 34:9, 10). A similar spouted bottle, discovered in Tomb 200 at Giv'at Sharet, differs only in the applied wound trail on the neck (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:58-59, Fig. 16:1), and may have served as a lamp filler. The assemblage from Giv'at Sharet that includes several other parallels to the Khirbat el-Ni'ana vessels, dates from the last quarter of the fourth to the first quarter of the fifth centuries (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:59). Spouted bottles appeared during the Roman period and continued with slight alterations into the Byzantine period (Barag 1970:220-221, Type 23:1 Roman, Type 23:3 Byzantine; PI. 47: Types 23:1, 23:3, and see further references therein). Two spouted bottles in the Israel Museum collections represent different periods: the earlier one dates to the third-fourth centuries, while the later subtype dates to the sixth-seventh centuries (Israeli 2003:165, Cat. No. 173; 173, Cat. No. 193). The bottle from Khirbat el-Ni'ana displays a combination of those two pieces and probably dates in between, contemporary with the one found at Giv'at Sharet. Spindle-Shaped Vessel (Fig. 14:10).— This vessel has a spindle-shaped body, resembling not the common elongated spindle-shaped tube,15 but rather the two-handled flasks, like the one unearthed in Tomb 200 at Giv'at Sharet, dated to a short period of time from the last quarter of the fourth century to the first quarter of the fifth century (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:56, 59, Fig. 16:2, and see therein references to Beit Fajjar, Netiv FTa-Lamed-FIe, Kh. Dikhrin and Gezer). The parallels cited in the Giv'at Sharet report (bar Beit Fajjar) came from sites in the vicinity of Khirbat el-Ni'ana; therefore, we suggest that this vessel was also a local product. Decorated Vessels These specimens (Fig. 15) represent varied shapes and decorations. Only one piece of each type was found. These vessels have parallels in other sites in modem-day Israel, as well as in Egypt (Karanis), Syria (Dura-Europos) and Jordan (Abila). Vessel No. 1 has a different fabric than the other two pieces, and may have, therefore, been brought from a distance rather than made in the local workshop. Numbers 2 and 3, although displaying exceptional shapes, are similar in their fabric to the local products.

Decorated vessels. the base of the neck. The vessel is decorated with an applied horizontal trail on the funnelshaped mouth and a vertical pattern of pinched bifurcated ribs on the body. The shape, color, fabric quality and milky weathering are characteristic of the second-third centuries. Examples were found, e.g., at Dura-Europos, the specimens there dated from the second century to 256 CE (Clairmont 1963:48-50, PI. 23:186199 ־), and at Karanis (Harden 1936:208, PI. 18:593). Pinched vertical ribs continued to appear up to the fourth century, yet on different types of bottles. A fragment of a similarly decorated bottle was discovered at Jalame near the furnace (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:80-81, Fig. 4-39:351). Other specimens came from Tomb XV at Hanita (Barag 1978a:23, 26-27, Fig. 12:50) and Samaria (Crowfoot 1957:410, Fig. 94:12). A large bottle from the Franciscan Museum at Nazerat was allegedly unearthed at Bet She'an (Bagatti 1967:229, Fig. 3:78). Moreover, funnel-shaped mouths adorned with a single trail and constricted necks appear on some of the local types at Khirbat el-Ni'ana (Fig. 33:7-10), suggesting the bottle with</page><page sequence="36">108 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya katsnelson pinched vertical ribs (Fig. 15:1) belonged to the assemblage and was neither earlier in date nor imported. Mold-Blown Bottle with Grape Design (Fig. 15:2).— This poorly-preserved piece, consisting of the base and a small part of the ovoid body, is part of a mold-blown bottle with grape design. The body was blown into a two-part mold with a stylized grape pattern, comprising rows of hemispherical bulges. The type, known mostly from collections, displays varied upper parts, occasionally with handles. It was recorded mostly in Syria-Palestine and Egypt and dated, primarily on stylistic grounds, to the second-third centuries (Israeli 2003:310, Cat. Nos. 413, 414), with variants dated to the fourth century (Stern 1995:187, 191, Cat. Nos. 120-128, and see full discussion therein). The closest parallel to the Khirbat elNi'ana piece is a grape bottle unearthed in a Late Roman tomb at Horbat Qastra (GorinRosen and Katsnelson 1999: Color Plate iii:2). Two body fragments of grape vessels were uncovered in a settling pool at Ras el'Ein, Shekhem and dated to the fourth century (Magen2005: PI. 20:8,9). A similarly decorated bottle with a funnel-shaped mouth and a collar above the shoulder was discovered in Burial Cave D at Nazerat (Feig 1990:78-79, Figs. 10:18; 11:4). The vessel, found together with a third-century flask, was erroneously dated to the second-third centuries.16 A similar bottle, said to have been unearthed at Bet She'an in 1932, is in the Franciscan Museum at Nazerat (Bagatti 1967:228-229, Fig. 3:77). Another bottle from Bet She'an is in the collections at the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem (Israeli 2003:310). A bottle with grape design was unearthed in Tomb L-2 at Abila that was in use in the fourth-sixth centuries (Fuller 1987:146, Fig. 118B). A similar flask was found at Karanis (Harden 1936: PI. 18:628). Vessel with 'Toe Base ' (Fig. 15:3).— The base probably belonged to a bowl or a flask. This type of base was frequent from the second century onward, yet rarely published. The earlier finds were uncovered at Karanis (Harden 1936:194, 219-220, PI. 19:678, 681, 682, 708) and at Dura-Europos, in a context of the second or early third centuries (Clairmont 1963:50-51, Pis. 5:204-208; 6:211). 'Toe bases' continued into the Late Roman period. Two bases of this type were unearthed in Late Roman contexts at the courthouse site in 'Akko (Avshalom-Gorni 1999: Fig. 22:3).17 Fragments of 'toe bases' were found in an unstratified context at Jalame (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:59-60, Fig. 4-22:161) and in Tomb I at Nahariyya, dated to the third century and the first half of the fourth century (Barag 1970:141, Type 3:25, PI. 32:25). Another base was recently published from the hippodrome at Shekhem (Magen 2005: PL 41:15), and other specimens were uncovered along the southern coast of Israel, e.g., Ashqelon.18 A 'toe base' was found at Jerash, in Phases 1-3, dated to the first-third centuries (Kehrberg 1986: Fig. 9:9). These bases were widespread in north Sinai, where they are dated mostly to the fourth-fifth centuries.19 The fabric of the 'toe base' from Khirbat elNi'ana resembles that of other vessels from the site. Additionally, the 'toes' are rather long and thick, evenly spaced and carefully worked compared with 'toe bases' from other sites. Furthermore, the same basket also yielded two glass wasters. All three factors suggest it is a local product. Cosmetic Tubes Several types of cosmetic vessels with a single or double tube were collected at the site. Most of them are complete or missing small parts. They belong to a well-known group of vessels used as cosmetic containers, for instance for kohl, often discovered with a bronze or ivory applicator or kohl stick. These vessels are found in Late Roman and early Byzantine complexes, mostly tombs. The tubes from Khirbat el-Ni'ana share features such as fabric, style and workmanship, indicating a local workshop at the site.</page><page sequence="37">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 109 The single tubes are characterized by an applied trail-wound base. They are all decorated with either applied trails or mold-blown ribbing, while the double tubes are all plain. Double tubes—plain, as in Khirbat el-Ni'ana, or, more often elsewhere, decorated with applied trails—are a frequent find in excavations in Israel, Jordan and Syria. They appeared in the middle of the fourth century and continued to prevail with small alterations up to the late Byzantine period (Barag 1970:175-177, Types 12:2, 12:3, PI. 39:2, 3). The numerous double tubes from Khirbat el-Ni'ana have two tubular-shaped containers made by pinching the parison. They are classified by their varied handles into three groups: tubes with two handles (Fig. 18), three handles (Fig. 19) and elaborate handles (Figs. 20, 21). The tubes and handles bear great resemblance, as if made by the same local glass craftsman. Tubes of the three groups were discovered together and are therefore dated to the same period, indicating that handles cannot serve as chronological factors, as had been suggested in the past (Barag 1970:176, see discussion of Type 12:2-3). Single Tubes with Applied Base (Fig. 16).— These single tubes, two of them complete (Nos. 1, 2; see also English Cover: left, center), have a nearly cylindrical body, slightly constricted where it meets the funnel-shaped mouth. The rims are infolded and the handles are generally drawn from the body up to the rim. Number 1 is flanked by crude handles, too massive in proportion to the body. Number 2 has two short handles and a basket handle on top. These handles were formed by drawing a glass trail from the body up to the rim, then over the vessel to the other side of the rim, then attaching it to the body. The most characteristic feature of these vessels is the trail-wound base, created by a massive trail wound once or twice and applied to the thickened bottom and then flattened while the glass was still hot. The tubes are decorated in various techniques, including horizontallywound applied trails (No. 1) and vertical (No. 2) or twisted (No. 3) mold-blown ribbing. The single-tube cosmetic vessels are rather common finds in Late Roman (mid-third to fourth centuries) burial complexes excavated in Israel (Barag 1970:155-158, Type 7, PI. 35:13־, and see further discussion and references Fig. 16 ► No. Loc.

Single tubes with applied base. therein). The single tubes appear in various forms, with or without handles, with trailed or ribbed decoration, and generally mounted on a pushed-in, hollow ring base, like the one from Tomb 200 at Giv'at Sharet, dated to the last quarter of the fourth and the first quarter of the fifth centuries (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:50, 56, 59, Fig. 17:1). The specimens from Khirbat el-Ni'ana with trail-wound bases and massive uneven handles probably represent early Byzantine production, continuing the Late Roman tradition. Only very few excavated parallels were published so far, e.g., a trailed tube with basket handles and an applied base from Tomb 1 at Netiv Ha-LamedHe, dated to the late fourth-early fifth centuries (Barag 1974:82, Fig. 2:3, and see an example from Tell en-Nasbe therein). The general shape of the tubes and their decoration seem disproportional and carelessly made, attesting to a local production. Plain Double Tubes with Two Handles (Figs. 17:1,2; 18).— These cosmetic vessels are plain and uneven, with an unevenly infolded rim and tooling marks on the body. The bottoms are</page><page sequence="39">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 111 Fig. 17. Cosmetic vessels: (1) Fig. 18:1; (2) Fig. 18:2; (3) Fig. 19:3; (4) Fig. 21; (5) Fig. 20. thickened, convex and unevenly flattened by the pontil. Small handles on both sides are drawn up from the body to the rim (Barag 1970:176, Type 12:2, PI. 39:2). At least four additional vessels of this subtype (not illustrated) were collected at the site. Although more examples of decorated double tubes have been published than of plain ones, only the plain vessels are mentioned hereby. A double tube with two crude handles was discovered at Giv'at Sharet, in Tomb 200 dated to the last quarter of the fourth and the first quarter of the fifth centuries' (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:50, 59, Fig. 17:2).20 This piece also sheds light on the use of these vessels as kohl tubes; it was found together with a bronze spatula and bore dark residue that was tested to be galena, the basic material used in the manufacture of kohl (Seligman, Zias and Stark 1996:50). Similar double tubes with two handles were found, e.g., in burial caves at Horbat Hanut,21 and in Cave D at Nazerat (Feig 1990:78-79, Fig. 10:17).22 Another example was unearthed at Abila, Jordan, in Tomb L-2 dated to the fourth-sixth centuries (Fuller 1987:145-146, Fig. 118A). The variations in the shape of the handles and their workmanship, either crude or delicate, are the minute fingerprints of a local workshop and even of a glass artisan. Plain Double Tubes with Three Handles (Figs. 17:3 ; 19).— These tubes are similar to those with two handles (Fig. 18), yet have an additional basket handle over the vessel, attached to the top of the small side handles (Barag 1970:177, Type 12:3, PI. 39:3). A similar vessel with a crude basket handle and uneven side handles was discovered with a bronze spatula in a Roman-Byzantine mausoleum at Khirbat Sabiya, dated from the late third or early fourth centuries up to the fifth or sixth centuries (Ayalon 1994: Figs. 5:8; 6). Other such double tubes were unearthed at Tell en-Nasbe, in Tomb 33 dated to the late fourthearly fifth centuries (McCown 1947:107, Fig. 105:1) and at Gezer, in Tomb 156 (Macalister 1912: PI. 108:7), dated by Barag to the midseventh century (Barag 1970:175, 177, Type 12:3, and see additional references therein).

E.107). The three plain double tubes with three handles from Khirbat el-Ni'ana are very similar in shape, quality and workmanship, and point to a local production. Plain Double Tubes with Elaborate Handles (Figs. 17:4, 5; 20; 21).— The plain body of these nearly complete specimens is flanked by two small side handles and adorned by multiple applied basket handles rising over the rim. Two additional double tubes of this subtype (not illustrated; L57, B289; L62, B313) were registered at the site. Barag noted that all examples of this type known at the time have decoration on the body and that no undecorated specimen was recorded. He classified the decorated type and dated it particularly to the fifth century (Barag 1970:177-178, Type 12: 5-1, PI. 39:5-1, and see therein references to Bet 'Anya and Yaffo). A very similar double tube with elaborate handles, in the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, is dated to the fifth century and said to have originated in Lydda (Lod) (Fleming 1999:106, Fig. E.49). The double tubes with elaborate handles from Khirbat el-Ni'ana are very similar in shape, quality and workmanship, pointing to a local production. Bowl-Shaped Oil Lamps The specimens from the site (Fig. 22) represent several variants of bowl-shaped oil lamps, generally discovered in public buildings, as well as private dwellings. They were frequent in the eastern Mediterranean during the fifth-seventh centuries. The bowl-shaped oil lamps from Khirbat el-Ni'ana are dated the latest among the Late Roman-early Byzantine group, yet they constitute earlier versions of the well-known Byzantine types. Bowl-Shaped Oil Lamps with Oufolded Rim and Three Handles (Fig. 22:1, 2).— Despite their tiny dimensions, these fragments clearly represent the type of oil lamp most frequent during the Byzantine period and into the Umayyad period. Examples have been discovered, e.g., at Ashqelon (Katsnelson 1999:78*, Fig. 5:1-3; Katsnelson and Jackson-Tal 2004:106, Fig. 3:1, and see further references therein). Bowl-Shaped Oil Lamps with Crude Loop Handles (Fig. 22:3).— This handle belonged to a suspended oil lamp with three handles applied on the body at mid-height.

This type has the same rims and handles as Fig. 22:1, 2. The bottom is generally thickened and concave or pushed-in with a tubular ring base. An incomplete specimen was found in the Byzantine baptistery at Nir Gallim, dated to the fifth-sixth centuries (Gorin-Rosen 2002c: 123-124, Fig. 2:5, and see therein parallels from Ashqelon, Jerusalem, Bet She'an and the Negev, and a complete example from Samaria).

Bowl-shaped oil lamps. also displays a rounded rim, yet a different body shape. Three more stems (not illustrated), resembling Nos. 6 and 8, were collected at the site. Several rims and stems of similar lamps were recovered in the baptistery at Nir Gallim, dated to the fifth-sixth centuries (Gorin-Rosen 2002c:122~123, Fig. 2:1-4, and see further discussion and references therein). The stems from Khirbat el-Ni'ana are rather short and have a slight indent and a constriction where they join the body. This may be a characteristic feature, indicating a local workshop. Stemmed bases of this type were widespread, and when discovered in large homogenous groups, may attest to local production. About 400 oil-lamp stems were recovered at Caesarea Maritima (Peleg and Reich 1992:155-158, Figs. 19, 20, and see further references therein). They were found in a locus that "probably served as a dump... perhaps as waste from a neighboring glass factory or simply as a garbage heap" (Peleg and Reich 1992:158). Despite their dubious provenance in a "garbage heap", these specimens represent the vessels in daily use in the city, vessels that were probably manufactured locally. Another large group of stems comes from Samaria, where some 40 stems of the hollow type were discovered in the glass factory area (Crowfoot 1957:414-415, Figs. 96:2, 6; 98:4). The Glass Objects Forty-eight small glass objects were uncovered in Tombs I and VI during the 1996-1997 excavation at Khirbat el-Ni'ana.

Glass Beads The corpus from Khirbat el-Ni'ana comprises simple unadorned beads, as well as beads decorated with trails or spots. These types of beads are generally attributed to the fourth-fifth centuries. The glass beads were generally manufactured by winding or folding a gob of glass around a rod (probably of metal), followed by tooling (for a general discussion on the technology of ancient glass beads, see Spaer 2001:45-48). Most of the beads display low quality glass and careless workmanship, with pronounced marks of unfinished tooling. The beads were possibly produced locally, together with glass vessels found at the site. The plain cylindrical and hexagonal beads (Nos. 24-30) were probably drawn from glass tubes and tooled, whereas the facetted beads (Nos. 31-33) were probably rod-formed and then molded or ground. The glass is largely translucent and of various tinges of deep bluishgreen; it is of better quality than the beads discussed above. Plain Beads (Fig. 23:1-12).— These beads are mostly opaque and occasionally translucent.</page><page sequence="47">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 119 The colors are dark, generally blue and green appearing as black; it is difficult to distinguish the colors of the beads due to their poor preservation.

Numbers 8-12 are small beads of undefined shape with pronounced tooling marks; No. 12 probably had a trailed body.

A group of similar beads was discovered at Horbat Qastra, in tombs dated mostly to the Roman and Byzantine periods (Spaer 2001:102-103, Fig. 47).23 A bead resembling Nos. 14-17 was unearthed in a rectangular tomb at Ashqelon, dated to the fourth-fifth centuries (GorinRosen 2002a:87*-88*, Fig. 136:16). Beads of this type were also found in burial caves in the Galilee, e.g., a bead resembling No. 20, from Cave 3 at Kisra, dated to the fourth-early fifth centuries (Stem 1997:126, Fig. 14:75). Number 21 is exceptional in its elaborate, yet hardly preserved pattern: an originally red field adorned with spiral bands of a blue trail, framed by thinner white trails. 'Eye' and 'Crumb' Beads (Fig. 23:22, 23).— These barrel-shaped beads are simple versions of their archetypes. Bead No. 22, poorly preserved, has an 'eye' pattern, probably made of three colors. Number 23 is a 'crumb' bead, the likes of which were uncovered, e.g., in Cave 1 at Akeldama (Winter 1996:113-114, Fig. 7.2:10-12, and see further references therein). Cylindrical, Hexagonal and Faceted Beads (Fig. 23:24-33).— Numbers 24-30 are plain cylindrical and hexagonal beads. Beads resembling No. 29 were found in Burial Cave 2 at Khirbat el-Shubeika, dated from the Late Roman to the Umayyad periods (Katsnelson 2002:326, Fig. 2:9). Beads Nos. 31-33 were molded or ground into facets, imitating precious stones. Numbers 31 and 32 are complex versions, named 'cornerless cube' beads, typical of many Roman and post-Roman sites in the region (Spaer 2001:64, 74, Nos. 48, 49). Similar beads were recovered from Cave 3 at Kisra, dated to the fourth-early fifth centuries (Stern 1997:126, Fig. 14:72, 73). Number 33 is a larger pyramidal bead with a single perforation. This type of bead, generally used as a double-perforated spacer, is dated around the third century and is considered</page><page sequence="51">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 123 a local product. Parallels are known, e.g., from Tomb XV at Hanita, Bet She'arim and Jerusalem (Spaer 2001:75, No. 53). Faience(?) Beads These rounded squat beads (Fig. 23:34-37) are severely corroded. Although no glaze survived on the surface, they may have been made of faience. These beads were formerly referred to as 'frit beads'. Numbers 34 and 35 are plain, whereas Nos. 36 and 37 are tool-ribbed. Similar plain and ribbed beads are common finds in burial contexts of the Late Roman and Byzantine periods, e.g., from Cave 1 at Akeldama (Winter 1996:114-115, Fig. 7.2:17, 18, and see further references therein). Miscellaneous Small Objects Pendant (Fig. 24:1).— This is a small conical pendant with a loop twisted where it joins the body. It is a crude version of a familiar local type known as 'simple looped pendant'. Similar pendants were discovered, e.g., in Burial Cave 1 at Khirbat el-Shubeika, dated to the Late Roman and Byzantine periods (Katsnelson 2002:323, Fig. 1:24, 25) and in the tombs of the fourth-sixth centuries at Horshat Tal (Spaer 2001:176, Fig. 81, two top rows). Bracelet (Fig. 24:2).— This is a fragment of a circular-sectioned twisted bracelet. This type of twisted monochrome bracelet is broadly considered pre-Islamic (Spaer 1988:59, Fig. 5&lt; י I 0 1 1 Fig. 24. Miscellaneous small objects. No. Loc. Bask.

A similar bracelet, dated to the Late RomanByzantine periods, came from Giv'at Yasaf (Gorin-Rosen 1999:137, Fig. 1:4), and another was unearthed in the 'Dominus Flevit' compound, in Tomb 221 (Bagatti and Milik 1958: Fig. 37:34), probably dated to the middle or the second half of the third century (Barag 1970:29). Seals (Fig. 24:3, 4).— These two pieces were made of bright hues of greenish-blue translucent glass. The quality is quite mediocre, judging by their carelessly executed shapes and designs. These two perforated seals bear intaglio images; they may have been used as either seals or amulets. Seals of this type are usually dated to the Persian period (Oman 2001: Cat. Nos. 505-519) and were probably produced in a Syro-Phoenician workshop (Bianchi 2002:174, NE. 27a-d, and see therein a group of contemporary specimens from the Borowski collection). These specimens are the earliest glass objects recorded at Khirbat el-Ni'ana, yet they correspond to the Late Roman-early Byzantine corpus, reused as beads or amulets. Seal No. 3 is scaraboid and perforated lengthwise. It depicts a molded, rather than engraved, unclear intaglio scene, portraying two left-facing animals: a lion(?) with a raised tail pursuing another animal, its form uncertain. No parallels to this scene were located. Quite a few Persian-dated glass scaraboids were discovered in Israel, including some from the vicinity of Khirbat el-Ni'ana (Brandi 2000). Number 4 is a conical seal with a small perforation at the top. It has a molded intaglio motif depicting a long-bearded male head facing right. Conical glass seals were quite common in the eastern Mediterranean region. A very similar seal of unknown provenance, in the British Museum collections, dates to the late sixth-late fourth centuries BCE (Barag 1985:58, No. 106). A conical seal depicting a sphinx found at Dor dates to the late sixthfifth centuries BCE (Spaer 2001:216, Fig. 90). Another contemporary seal depicting a lion has been recently published from a tomb at Horbat Zikhrin (Jackson-Tal 2007: Fig. 3:1). Remains of Glass Production The remains of glass production unearthed during the 1996-1997 excavation in several locations were rather scant compared with the large quantity of glass vessels. These remains include deformed vessels, glass drops, several chunks of raw glass and a few fragments of furnace debris (Fig. 25). However, these constitute only some of the types of evidence expected to be found in a glass workshop location. Completely missing from the site (from both the 1996-1997 and the 1991 seasons) are the most diagnostic remains of glass blowing, which indicate the location of a furnace. These are moils, also called 'overblows'—the glass originally in contact with the blowpipe, and pontil knock-offs—the hot glass blobs affixed to the pontil and used to attach it to the vessel; both turn into cullets after the vessel is removed from the pontil. On the whole, the production debris from Khirbat el-Ni'ana resembles that discovered at the Jalame glass workshop, dated to the second half of the fourth century (Weinberg 1988, and see below for specific details). The complete late-Byzantine glass workshop unearthed at Bet She'an in the past decade is also a good example and a source of comparable information (GorinRosen 2000a:59-60). Deformed Vessels (Fig. 25:1-4).— A few fragments of deformed vessels were found at the site. The deformations were probably the outcome of faults during the blowing or annealing processes. All the deformed vessels belonged to types prevalent in the assemblage in rather large quantities. For instance, No. 1 is a bottle with a wide funnel-shaped mouth decorated with thick trails, similar to Fig. 13:4; the rim and handle fragment, No. 2, belonged to a jug, probably similar to those in Figs. 10:8 and 11:4; the deformed upper-part of a double kohl tube, No. 3, resembles those in Figs. 17-20. Except for these recognizable vessels, the excavation yielded additional deformed necks</page><page sequence="53">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 125 10 16 0 2 Fig. 25.

Deformed vessels were also discovered in the factory dump at Jalame (Weinberg 1988:35, Fig. 3-12). Glass Drops (Fig. 25:5-8).— The elongated glass drops are characterized by a cylindrical or squat shape with a rounded edge and are all broken at the top. They are made of greenish-blue, bluishgreen and greenish glass and some have yellowish streaks. Although some of the drops resemble the solid stem of bowl-shaped oil lamps, it is obvious that these pieces are production debris rather than fragments of vessels. Similar drops, identified as 'test drops5, were found in the debris of the Jalame glass workshop. Weinberg singled them out as the most interesting group of objects discovered in the factory dump, easily explained by reference to modern glassmaking procedures: "When a new batch is prepared, a small amount of glass is taken from the furnace on the end of a pontil and allowed to hang down, thus forming an elongated drop. By examining the quality and viscosity of this drop, the glassmaker determines whether the batch is sufficiently melted and the quality of the glass satisfactory." (Weinberg 1988:36, Pl. 3-8B). These glass drops, which "seem not to have been noted at ancient or medieval glasshouse sites" (Weinberg 1988:36), have so far served as a significant indication of glassmaking traditions in Palestine during the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. In addition to these well-shaped drops, irregular drops with remains of metal from the blowpipe or the pontil were also collected at the site (No. 8). Similar wasters were found at Jalame, identified as "blobs pulled out and tooled" (Weinberg 1988:35: Fig. 3-10). Raw Glass Chunks (Fig. 25:9-20).— Numerous raw glass chunks were unearthed at the site. They range in size from 30 mm long to 100 mm long. Most of the chunks are of bluish-green hues; some are green with yellowish streaks; others are yellowish-brown with green streaks. The glass is characterized by a fine, clear fabric. One piece displays a lower-quality fabric, less clear and dotted with impurities (No. 16), another bears the remains of the tank floor (No. 20). Most of these chunks were broken, as attested by Nos. 9-15 and 17-19. Large quantities of raw glass chunks are a typical find around glass workshop locations. Piles of lumps were stored at the Bet She'an workshop, in the main room near the furnace, against the walls, in the storeroom and in the courtyard (Gorin-Rosen 2000a:59-60). Raw glass chunks were traded and purchased for remelting in furnaces; they are mentioned in ancient sources, e.g., the Babylonian Talmud (Weinberg 1988:25, also see n. 2).

They convey the conglomerate structure of the severely-heated stone, with some veins of partially-vitrified glass and opaque layers (No. 21). The site also yielded fragments of the furnace floor, with a glass layer on top (No. 22). Occasionally, glass that seeped during the production process appeared in small holes and cracks in the stone. These specimens of dismantled glass furnaces indicate that the raw glass chunks were melted in limestone containers of a kind also used in the Jalame glass workshop (Weinberg 1988:31). The 1991 Excavation Introduction Although smaller and less diverse than the 19961997 assemblage, the group of glass vessels from the salvage excavation conducted at the site in 1991 by Nitza Bashkin (1995:59-61) is significant in expanding the corpus of types produced in the local workshop (see Preface).24 The Glass Vessels of the Late Roman and Early Byzantine Periods Some two hundred fragments, including four complete vessels, were collected during the 1991 excavation (Fig. 26). About 80o/o of the vessels were discovered inside a pool (L141) in the industrial area (Bashkin 1995:59) and three were retrieved from another pool (L143). The rest of the glass finds were scattered at the site. Seventy-four glass vessels are hereby presented, following the typology of the 1996-1997 glass finds (see above); vessel types studied therein are briefly recorded, while those appearing only in the 1991 group are discussed in length. All the vessels were blown, generally of light green, greenish-blue and bluish-green glass. A few vessels are yellowish-green, olive-green and colorless. Several vessels are decorated with trails, either blue and turquoise or of the same color as the vessel. The vessels bear a silver layer of weathering and iridescence, and are generally covered with sand deposits. The glass is very bubbly with black impurities and blowing spirals, the quality of the fabric is rather low and the workmanship often careless. Bowls Shallow Bowls with Rounded Rim (Fig. 27: 1,2).— These bowls usually had a low hollow pushed-in ring base, such as Fig. 30:5-7. This type of bowl was very common during the fourth century. Numerous examples were unearthed in the 1996-1997 excavations (Fig. 1:1-4). Bowls with Outfolded Rim (Fig. 27:3-8).— These bowls are more varied and common, and appear in a small shallow version (No. 3) and a deeper one (No. 4). Numbers 6-8 are characterized by an upright rim with a wide fold. Numbers 5 and 6 were discovered together with a low hollow ring base (Fig. 30:6); this base belonged to the same bowl as either No. 5 or No. 6. These bowls resemble the ones in the 1996-1997 assemblage (Fig. 2:1-6). Vessel with Infolded Rim (Fig. 27:9).— As infolded rims are generally common on bottles and jugs, yet very rare on bowls (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:50), this piece is either a plate or a deformed vessel. A very similar rim (not illustrated; light bluish; L9, B152) was uncovered in the 1996-1997 season, in the same basket with glass production remains (Fig. 25:2, 8). Deep Bowls with Double Fold Below Rim (Fig. 28).— These bowls display uniformity in shape, fabric and workmanship characteristic of a craftsman's fingerprint, suggesting they are the work of a local artist. A wider range of variations is evident among the bowls from the 1996-1997 assemblage (Fig. 3). Shallow Bowls with Cut-Off Rim (Figs. 26:1; 29).— These bowls, known as 'segmental bowls', usually bear horizontal incisions or</page><page sequence="58">130 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson A 9 Fig. 27.

A bowl of this type, although with a flared rim, was uncovered in a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Shekhem, dated to the fourth century (Magen 2005: PI. 17:1). Several similar bowls were unearthed in Beirut and dated to the fifth century (Jennings and Abdallah 2001-2002:242, Fig. 6:11, 12, 15).

Figure 31:6 is smaller and cylindrical or conical, and probably represents another closed vessel, such as a jug.25 Beakers Beakers with Solid Base (Fig. 32:1-3).— Bases resembling Nos. 1 and 2 were recovered during the 1996-1997 season (Fig. 8:4-6). Base No. 3 is slightly more convex, and may have belonged to a juglet. It was probably produced in the same method, yet for a vessel with different proportions. Beakers and Jugs with Pushed-In Ring Base (Fig. 32:4-6).— Number 4 represents a rather small vessel, probably a small beaker or a juglet, while Nos. 5 and 6 probably belonged to jugs or juglets. Several bases of this type were found in the 1996-1997 excavations (Fig. 8:11-15). Bottles and Jugs Bottles and Jugs with Funnel-Mouth (Fig. 33:1-3).— These vessels are generally of small or medium size. Number 1 is very delicate and of high quality fabric. Number 2 is broken; it could have belonged to a bottle with an infolded rim as No. 3, or to a bottle resembling Fig. 33:13, with its wide ridge just below the rim (see below). At least three similar vessels were unearthed in the 1996-1997 excavation (Fig. 11:9). Bottles and Jugs with Funnel-Shaped Mouth and Narrow Neck (Figs. 26:7-9; 33:4-13).— In addition to the pieces presented below, the 1991 excavation yielded several more fragments of this type (not illustrated). The better preserved ones display a typical, usually triangular body (Fig. 33:4-7). Some have a constriction at the base of the neck (Fig. 33:4—10). Figure 33:5 bears shallow mold-blown ribs, resembling those on other bottles from this corpus (Fig. 35:5,8) and on a bottle discovered in the 19961997 excavation (Fig. 14:7). Several are adorned with a single horizontal trail on the mouth (Fig. 33:7-12), exactly like their counterparts from the 1996-1997 season (Fig. 10:1-9).

Jugs with Constricted Neck (Figs. 26:10; 34:1-3).— At least three vessels with their handles preserved may be confidently classified as jugs. Number 3 preserved its entire profile, with a characteristic triangular body and a constricted neck. The handle of No. 1 is drawn diagonally to the rim and misplaced, suggesting careless workmanship. A complete jug of this type and a small specimen with its handle broken were unearthed during the 1996-1997 excavation (Fig. 10:8, 9). Bottles with Applied Trails on Mouth and Neck (F ig. 34:4-8).— Each of these bottles represents a subtype and is discussed separately. Although they resemble specimens from the 1996-1997 corpus, they are not identical and are therefore classified as subtypes. Bottle No. 4 is thin-walled and delicate and has an upright rim and multiple thin trails wound horizontally on the neck. Similar bottles, though with a thicker wall, were discovered at Jalame, some in the factory dump, dated to the second half of the fourth century, and others in the Byzantine winepress (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:70-71, Fig. 4-32:272, 274). Number 5 has a slightly flared rim and a wide cylindrical neck decorated with thin wound trails, three of which survived. Number 6 has a wide funnel-shaped mouth with multiple trails wound on its upper part, a short narrow neck and a slanted shoulder. Number 7 is a funnel-shaped mouth decorated with a few wound trails. A similar piece was found at Jalame and identified as different than the local types (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:71-72, Fig. 4-32:282). Number 8 represents another subtype with an upright rim and a cylindrical neck decorated with trails on its upper portion and on its lower end, above the shoulder. The yellowish color of this bottle is rare among the vessels in the assemblage, yet it is identical to that of Fig. 34:10, suggesting both fragments belonged to the same bottle. Spouted Bottles (Figs. 26:11; 34:9, 10).— These bottles are similarly shaped and probably represent another local type. Number 10 may have belonged to the same bottle as Fig. 34:8 (see above), thus establishing at least two subtypes</page><page sequence="68">140 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson ■w Fig. 34. Various bottles and jugs. of spouted bottles in the assemblage: plain and decorated. A spouted vessel was also recovered during the 1996-1997 season (Fig. 14:9). Bottles with Upright Rounded Rim, Wide Cylindrical Neck and Cylindrical or Squat Body (Figs. 26:12-16; 35:1-9).— The most homogeneous group from the 1991 season consists of plain bottles (Nos. 1—4, 6, 7, 9, and at least 20 more pieces, not illustrated) and two mold-blown ribbed bottles (Nos. 5, 8). The bottles range from small (Nos. 1 and 2) to medium-sized (Nos. 3, 4, 9), to large (No. 7). They are plainly shaped without a pontil and hence the rims are simply cut or fire-finished. The mold-blown bottle (No. 5) has no pontil scar as well, and the rim is of the upright and rounded type (No. 8). Their outstanding uniformity of shape, fabric and workmanship suggests they are local products.</page><page sequence="69">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el־Ni'ana 141 &lt; Fig. 34 No. Loc.

Bottles similar to Nos. 1 and 2 were unearthed in Tomb 215 at the 'Dominus Flevit' compound on the Mount of Olives (Bagatti and Milik 1958:144-145, Fig. 34:4, 5). Cosmetic Tubes Double Tubes (Fig. 36).— These two fragments of cosmetic double tubes discovered in the 1991 excavation were also local products.

Bowl-Shaped Oil Lamp with Wick Tube (Fig. 37:2, 3).— The complete wick tube (No. 2) and the bowl with remains of a wick tube on its floor (No. 3) represent oil lamps with a wick tube applied to their floor center. Two specimens of this type were found in the 19961997 excavation (Fig. 22:4, 5). Bowl-Shaped Oil Lamp with Hollow Stem (Fig. 37:4, 5).— Number 4 is identical to the stem of a complete oil lamp from the 1996-1997 season (Fig. 22:6), characterized by a slight constriction where it joins the body and a slight bulge on the stem. Number 5 is curved and partially solid. Remains of Glass Production Only one definite piece of production debris was found in the 1991 excavation. It is a glass drop (Fig. 38) similar to the drops from the 1996-1997 season (Fig. 25:5—8), identified as 'test drops'. This drop joins the other finds associated with glass production discovered at the site and further supports the existence of a glass workshop at Khirbat el-Ni'ana. Furthermore, the excavator detected glass slags in a deposit near a mosaic pavement (Bashkin 1995:59). Summary and Discussion: Local Production of Glass Vessels at Khirbat el-Ni'ana—The Broader Scope The large quantity of glass vessels and the remains of production debris uncovered at Khirbat el-Ni'ana prompted a comprehensive study of the typological and technological aspects of the glass repertoire. Both issues induced special attention to the distribution and chronology of the assemblage. These subjects were discussed above and are therefore not addressed here. The following observations focus on the production of glass vessels, rather than raw glass, during the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. Production of glass vessels was widespread during the Late Roman period in both the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empire. Glass blowing, invented about four hundred years earlier, had already been extensively experimented and had reached its technological and artistic peaks, unsurpassed until this day (for a synopsis on the invention of glass blowing, see Israeli 2003:95-97). The local glass workshops supplied most of the demand for glass vessels and objects. The workshop at Khirbat el-Ni'ana, for example, manufactured tableware, such as bowls, beakers and bottles, alongside cosmetic jars and tubes. The study of glass workshops in present-day Israel is based primarily on the detailed report</page><page sequence="74">146 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson on the glass workshop at Jalame, excavated and published by Gladys Weinberg (1988). The Jalame workshop yielded remains of a furnace, raw material, debris of glass blowing and hot glassworking, as well as an abundance of glass vessels. It was dated by the excavators to the second half of the fourth century, however further studies of the pottery and the coins suggested it had continued to function in the fifth century. Yet, although it is dated to the early Byzantine period, the Jalame repertoire represents Late Roman traditions. One criterion for this assertion is the small amount of typical Byzantine vessels, such as wineglasses and oil lamps, compared with the numerous bowls, beakers and jugs characteristic of the Late Roman period. The vessel shapes in the glass repertoire from Khirbat el-Ni'ana closely resemble those from Jalame and demonstrate the same proportions, i.e., only two wineglasses (Fig. 8:16, 17) and 13 oil lamps (Figs. 21, 37) among more than 8000 fragments unearthed at the site. The map (Fig. 39) dotted with sites featuring glass workshops draws on two main sources of information: published material, as well as unpublished material studied by the IAA glass department over the last two decades. The map provides a general impression of the volume and distribution of glass production in Palestine in the Late Roman and Byzantine periods. The sites recorded on the map yielded glass manufacture remains; most of them also contained vessels resembling those discovered at Khirbat el-Ni'ana, discussed above. Sites where a local industry was identified based solely on the vessels discovered there were not set on the map (e.g., Khirbat el-Shubeika and Horbat Rimmon; see above, Methodological Research of Glass Workshops).

Selected glass workshops of the Late Roman and early Byzantine periods.</page><page sequence="75">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 147 The glass workshop at Khirbat el־Ni'ana, the subject of this study, is not the only one identified in the Shephelah region. Salvage excavations conducted at nearby Lod unearthed several pieces of production debris, including blowing leftovers (moils), glass drops and small raw glass chunks, within a Late Roman-early Byzantine assemblage.26 An industrial facility at Horbat Hermas, between Rehovot and Yavne, exposed remains of raw glass production and glass vessel making, including numerous blowing leftovers and furnace debris (Gorin-Rosen 2006:34*35־*, and see further references therein). Another local workshop was detected at Khirbat el-Fatuna, also in the vicinity of Yavne, where numerous trailwound bases were uncovered among remains of a glass industry.27 Glass workshops were identified farther north and northeast, e.g., at Samaria-Sebaste (Crowfoot 1957:404-405), at Bet She'an—a well-preserved facility dated to the Byzantine period (Gorin-Rosen 2000a:59-60), at Jatt on the Samarian foothills, yielding remains of glassworking (Gorin-Rosen 2004b:26*), and at Khirbat Jarrar, where numerous pieces of industrial debris, including glass drops, chunks of raw glass and overblows, were collected on the surface and dated to the Late Roman-early Byzantine periods (Gorin-Rosen 2004a: 17*). A similar pattern of densely located remains of Late Roman-Byzantine glass workshops is apparent in other regions: In the Haifa area— Horbat Qastra, Shiqmona and Bat Gallim;28 in the lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley—Bet She'arim, Jalame, Zippori and Raqit (LehrerJacobson 2003:247); and in the western Galilee, e.g., Kafr Yasif (Gorin-Rosen 2000a:57-59, and see further references therein). The abundance of glass workshops and their distribution indicate that glass vessel production was practiced in major cities, such as Lod, Samaria, Bet She'an and Zippori, as well as in small villages, such as Khirbat el-Ni'ana and most of the other sites mentioned above. Moreover, calculations of the amount of glass produced in ancient Palestine at these sites and others located in present-day Jordan and Lebanon, show that it far exceeded even an excessive consumption by the local population. This observation raises the probability of export to other markets, at least of a portion of the products. This speculation, along with a comprehensive investigation of local glass production, entails further research. Appendix 1 : Mamluk Glass Finds from the 1996-1997 Excavation A few glass finds from Area 101 of the 1996-1997 excavation at Khirbat el-Ni'ana correspond to the poor architectural remains of the latest occupation phase at the site during the Mamluk period (see Sion, this volume). They are contemporary with the pottery (de Vincenz and Sion, this volume) and the clay lamps (Sussman, this volume). The glass finds hereby presented include two marvered pieces, two bracelets and a plaque. Vessels with Marvered Decoration (Fig. 40: 1, 2).— These two small fragments of purple vessels with marvered decoration represent the most characteristic decorated types of the Mamluk period. Number 1 is a thick incurved rim of a large purple bowl, decorated with marvered trails of opaque greenish-blue glass. Bowls of this type were discovered in Area T of the Jewish Quarter excavations in Jerusalem and dated from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries (Brosh 2005a: 186; 2005b:2237־36 ,23־, Figs. 17.1, 17.2, and see further references and discussion therein). Several fragments of this type were found in salvage excavations in Jerusalem and Ramla.29 Number 2 belongs to a cosmetic bottle with an incurved or infolded rim, a short neck and a conical or pyramidal body. Complete specimens, presumably from Egypt or Syria, are dated to the twelfth-thirteen centuries (Carboni 2001:304, Cat. Nos. 80a, b, and see further references therein). Fragments, usually bases, of bottles of this type were discovered in excavations</page><page sequence="76">148 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson ID \ 3 0 2 1 I Fig. 40. Mamluk glass. No. Loc.

Four bottles of purple glass with white marvered trails were unearthed in Area T of the Jewish Quarter excavations and dated to</page><page sequence="77">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 149 the Mamluk period (Brosh 2005b:2526,45-47־, Figs. 22:35,23:8, and see further references and discussion therein). Bracelets (Fig. 40:3, 4).— Bracelets of two types were collected. Number 3 is decorated with an applied trail forming a triangular section. Number 4 is dotted with uneven multicolored crumbs, classified by Spaer as local, of the "Pre-Ottoman Islamic period" (Spaer 2001: 202, Cat. No. 469, and see further references therein). Both types of bracelets were unearthed at Giv'at Yasaf (Gorin-Rosen 1999:138-139, Fig. 1:10, 12) and attributed to the Umayyad through the Mamluk periods. However, the nature of the bracelets from Khirbat el-Ni'ana suggests they are of Mamluk date. Plaque (Fig. 40:5).— The rectangular, light greenish glass plate is smooth on both sides and finished on all four edges. Its surface is covered with a thin characteristic layer of iridescence, pointing to a medieval date. The function of this plaque is unclear; it may have served as a mirror or an inlay. Smaller circular plaques, known as 'magic mirrors', were often inlayed in objects serving in burial practices in the region from the fifth century (Rahmani 1964:55-60, and see discussion and interpretations therein). However, the plaque from Khirbat el-Ni'ana is larger and rectangular, and its fabric seems later in date. Three thin, colorless and octagonal plaques were discovered in Tomb 17 at Tel Mevorakh, dated to the late twelfth-thirteenth centuries (Barag 1978b:5-7, Fig. 11, and see further references therein). Although painted and of a different shape, these plaques probably served the same purposes as those from Khirbat el-Ni'ana. A similar rectangular plaque was recently recovered at Kefar Sava, in a cemetery dated to the Mamluk-Ottoman periods.30 Notes 1 We are grateful to our colleague Tamar Winter, who edited this paper, for her guidance, help and encouragement throughout the process. We also wish to thank our colleagues Yael Israeli and Maud Spaer for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper, and Marie-Dominique Nenna for her comments. 2 An extensive discussion on workshops is beyond the scope of this paper; research of glass workshops is currently taking place in France, Italy, Switzerland, Great Britain and Germany (see e.g., Nenna 2000; Foy 2003). 3 The glass finds were studied by Yael Gorin-Rosen and Tamar Winter of the IAA. Thanks are due to Eliezer Oren of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, who headed the North Sinai Survey, for the opportunity to study the glass finds before their return to the Egyptian authorities. 4 We wish to thank the excavator, Ofer Sion, for the opportunity to study the glass finds. Many thanks are also due to Olga Shorr and Mireia-Timna Elper for the glass restoration, to Clara Amit and Tsila Sagiv for the photography, to Michael Miles for drawing the vessels and objects, and to Carmen Hersch for additional drawings. 5 The numerous glass vessels unearthed in the fill of a settling pool at Ras el-'Ein, Flavia Neapolis, Shechem, were recorded by Sivan Sarig, guided by Yael Gorin-Rosen. Plates and a short description of the vessels were published, yet without further discussion (Magen 2005). However, this group is very important for the study of Late Roman glass in the region. Some types appear there in the greatest quantity so far published, while others are represented by a single piece, the only one of their type from a methodical excavation published so far. The richness of shapes and decorations, as well as the large quantity and quality of the material, allow us to suggest that most of the vessels from the settling pool at Ras el-'Ein are of local origin. 6 Unpublished, courtesy ofYosef Porath. 7 The glass finds from the University of Haifa excavations at Caesarea Maritima, headed by Joseph Patrich, were studied by Yael Israeli. 8 The bases from Khirbat el-Ni'ana belonged to bowls; however, bases of this type may have also</page><page sequence="78">150 Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya katsnelson held closed vessels, such as jugs and flasks. The only complete vessel with a trail-wound base published from excavations in the region is a flask from Tomb E220 at Samaria (Crowfoot 1957: Fig. 94:13). All other examples from Syria-Palestine published to date are in museum collections. Among them are groups of Late Roman fine jugs and head flasks with multiple trail-wound bases, dated to the fourth-fifth centuries (e.g., Whitehouse 1997:367-374, PI. 1-3; Israeli 2003:187, 190-191, Cat. Nos. 221,224-226). 9 The glass from Horbat Qastra is being studied by Yael Gorin-Rosen and Natalya Katsnelson. Thanks are due to Ze'ev Yeivin and Gerald Finkielsztejn, directors of the excavations, for permission to cite these finds. 10The glass from Tirat Karmel was studied by Ruth E. Jackson-Tal and Natalya Katsnelson. We wish to thank the excavator Shalom Yankelevitch for permission to cite these finds. 11 The glass vessels were studied by Ruth E. JacksonTal. The excavation was conducted by Kamil Sari and we thank him for permission to cite these finds. ,2The cistern at Bet Guvrin was excavated by Amos Kloner and Michael Cohen and we thank them for permission to cite these finds. 13The Pan sanctuary was excavated by Zvi Uri Maoz and the "Street of Shops" by Vassilios Tzaferis and Shoshana Israeli; we thank them for permission to cite these finds. The publication cited (Gorin-Rosen 2001) is an exhibition catalogue, not a scientific publication. 14The excavation was conducted by Shlomo Pipano. The glass finds have not been studied, yet several vessels were preliminarily published in the catalogue of the exhibition "Ancient Glass from the Holy Land" (Gorin-Rosen 1998). 15The elongated spindle-shaped tube, generally 30-50 cm long, was popular in both parts of the Roman Empire, particularly in the fourth century CE (Weinberg and Goldstein 1988:74; Isings 1957:126, Form 105; Barag 1970:220, PI. 47:4). 16Feig dated this cave to the second-third centuries, although the parallels quoted for the tubes date from the late third to the fourth centuries (Feig 1990:78). Moreover, Barag (1970:175) noted that this subtype appeared around the middle of the fourth century and not earlier. 17 Another piece was recorded during the first season conducted by Moshe Hartal. The glass finds are to be published in the IAA Reports series by Natalya Katsnelson. 18The excavation at the Ashqelon Marina was conducted by Shoshana Israeli. 19See n. 3. 70The numerous references cited on p. 58 of the Giv'at Sharet publication are of decorated double tubes, many of which were discovered in the vicinity. 21 The site at Horbat Hanut was excavated by Radwan Badhi and the glass was studied by Ruth E. JacksonTal. 22Seen. 16. 23See n. 9. 24We wish to thank the excavator, Nitza Bashkin for the opportunity to study the glass finds. Thanks are also due to Olga Shorr for the glass restoration, to Michael Miles for drawing the vessels and to Clara Amit for the photography. 25See n. 8. 26The site at Lod, Newe Yaraq, was excavated by Eli Yannai and Radwan Badhi and the glass was studied by Yael Gorin-Rosen and Ruth E. Jackson-Tal. We thank the excavators for permission to quote this information prior to the final report. 27See n. 11. 28The glass from Shiqmona and Bat Gallim was studied by Yael Gorin-Rosen. We wish to thank the excavators, Raz Kletter and Dror Barshad, for permission to cite these finds. 29The glass vessels from both excavations were studied by Yael Gorin-Rosen. Thanks are due to Gideon Avni, who headed the Herod's Gate excavations, and to Raz Kletter, excavator of the site at Ramla. 30The glass vessels were studied by Natalya Katsnelson. The excavation was conducted by Amir Gorzalczany, to whom we thank for permission to cite this find.</page><page sequence="79">Glass Production in Light of the Finds from Khirbat el-Ni'ana 151 References Avshalom-Gorni D. 1999.
