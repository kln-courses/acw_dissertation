<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> THEOMACHY, CREATION, AND THE POETICS OF QUOTATION  IN LONGINUS CHAPTER 9 m. d. usher T he quotations from Homer and the biblical book of  Genesis inLonginus chapter 9—“the most famous part of  the book in theeighteenth century” and a subject of  considerable interest ever since1—invite still closer inspection. Longinus’ critical assessment of Homer’s poetry in this chapter is justly famous and itself  deserving of  close consideration. But two more basic questions about these quotations have proven particularly stubborn: whether or not the Genesis passage is an in- terpolation,2 and whether or not Longinus is quoting Homer directly or using the material at second hand.3 According to Russell and West, it is probable (and in at least one case certain)4 that much of  this quoted material had been quoted and discussed already by others, possibly by Caecilius, the critic to whom Longinus is responding in this treatise.5 However, while it may be true that some of these Homeric passages had indeed attracted the attention of  other ancient critics and commentators,6 the way the quotations are concatenated by Longinus suggests rather that we are dealing with an author who is fully engaged (and conversant) with his source material. What is more, his method of  quotation reveals what we might call—for lack of  a better phrase—a This paper is dedicated to the memory of  my teacher and colleague, Robin Schlunk. RESPICE TELOS. 1. Russell 1964, xlvi, and see Averintsev’s recent appraisal (2000, 11–15) of  the modern reception of this section. 2. The history of  this controversy is summarized, with bibliography, in Russell 1964, 92; Russell himself views the Genesis passage not as an interpolation per se, but as “a sort of  parenthesis in the discussion” (p. 93). 3. For convenience I will follow common practice in using the name Longinus when referring to the author, even though we do not know for certain who wrote the work. 4.

Yet it must be said, with respect to actual quotation, the overlap between Longinus and other such authors—viz., Demetrius, Pliny the Younger, Plutarch, and Philostratus (see Russell 1964, 91)—is not ex- tensive. Pliny (Ep. 9.26.6) and Demetrius (Eloc. 83), for example, quote and comment only on the metaphor involved in the first half  of  verse 388 from Iliad 21 (a ̊mfμ de; savlpigxen mevgaÍ ou ̊ranovÍ), quoted by Longinus at 9.6. Philostratus (Her. 25.9) quotes the same half-line in a critique of  the content of  Il. 20.61–65 (two passages from the Iliad that Longinus conflates in quotation as a continuous passage—see further Exhibit 3 below). For his part, Plutarch (Mor. 16E) does not quote, but only alludes in a general way to the content of  Il. 20.61–65. Classical Philology 102 (2007): 292–303 [ç 2007 by The University of  Chicago.

However, we gather from where he left off  before the lacuna that Longinus is discussing the kind of sublimity achieved through the inventive power of  imagination.10 The first words we get after the gap are Longinus’ own. (The actual quotation is now lost with those missing leaves of  manuscript.) Those words make it clear that Longinus had quoted Homer’s depiction of  the goddess Eris (“Strife”) in Iliad 4 (lines 439–43), which he admires for the way the poet gives gods grandeur by endowing them with preternatural bodily size. What Longinus particularly admires is the “distance between heaven and earth” that the passage evokes (to; ejp∆ ou ̊rano;n a ̊po; ghÅÍ diavsthma): Exhibit 1 (re: Longinus 9.4)11 ≈rse de; tou;Í me;n ◊ArhÍ, tou;Í de; glaukΩpiÍ Âqhvnh 4.439 De∂movÍ t∆ hjde; FovboÍ kaμ ¢EriÍ aßmoton memau∂a, 4.440 ◊AreoÍ a ̊ndofovnoio kasignhvth eJtavrh te, 4.441 h§ t∆ ojlÇgh me;n prΩta koruvssetai, au ̊ta;r eßpeita 4.442 ou ̊ranåÅ ejsthvrixe kavrh kaμ ejpμ cqonμ baÇnei. 4.443 7. The concern here, of  course, is not with authorship or intention, but rather with the “poetics” of these quotations, i.e., with “the establishment of  general laws of  which [this] particular text is the product,” to invoke Todorov’s almost Aristotelian definition (1981, 6). Whether what I attribute to “Longinus” might in fact have been the work of  some predecessor(s) does not detract from the arguments presented here. 8. This observation corrects Stanley (1992, 278–81), who investigates Longinus’ quotations briefly (his main focus being the apostle Paul’s quotation of  scripture) and concludes that, “No pattern can be discerned in the various types of  material used by [Graeco-Roman] authors in adducing their quotations” (290). 9. In this regard I am expanding on West 1995. 10. See Russell 1964, xii–xvi. 11. Note: In the following exhibits of  text, I will be presenting more Homeric material than appears in Longinus. So as to distinguish clearly between what Longinus quotes and other (usually contiguous) verses from Homer, I give Longinus’ actual quotations in boldface. (All book and line numbers in the exhibits refer to the Iliad.) Note, too, that I have underlined key words and phrases to which I will be drawing attention in the course of  this discussion. Also, while I have chosen not to burden the page or the footnotes with full translations of  the Homeric passages, all relevant words and phrases have been translated or glossed. </page> <page sequence="3"> 294 M. D. Usher This good example from Homer reminds Longinus of  a bad example— which he quotes from the Pseudo-Hesiodic Shield, where a divinity, ÂcluvÍ (“Gloom”) though preternaturally large herself, is portrayed—quite un- favorably—with mucus dripping from her nose. This detail does not detain him long, however, for the distance covered by Eris as she grows large on the field of  battle immediately reminds him of  another diavsthma (and Longinus uses this word in his evaluation of  the passage12) and a second, positive example of  grandeur—namely, Homer’s description of  the great strides made by Hera’s supernatural horses in Iliad 5 (lines 768–72), where the goddess is traveling from Olympus back to the battlefield at Troy: Exhibit 2 (Longinus 9.5) mavstixen d∆ appouÍ: tw; d∆ ou ̊k aßkonte petevsqhn, 5.768 messhgu;Í gaÇhÍ te kaμ ou ̊ranouÅ a ̊steroventoÍ. 5.769 o§sson d∆ hjeroeide;Í a ̊nh;r ≥den ojfqalmo∂sin, 5.770 h§menoÍ ejn skopi¬Å, leuvsswn ejpμ o≥nopa povnton: 5.771 tovsson ejpiqr∫skousi qeΩn uÒyhceveÍ appoi. 5.772 What, we might ask, beyond a general thematic connection, helped call this second passage to mind? Though Longinus only quotes the simile portion of  the larger passage, I would suggest—following recent work on the use of  semantic and lexical prompts in Homeric composition13—the phrase messhgu;Í gaÇhÍ te kaμ ou ̊ranouÅ a ̊steroventoÍ that immediately precedes the simile functioned as a semantic trigger, evoking as it does the thematic elements in the description of  Eris in Iliad 4 that interested him in the first place: in both passages heaven and earth are mentioned together only to em- phasize the distance between them. (Compare, in particular, the contrasted pairs ou ̊ranovÍ – cq∫n in Exhibit 1, line 443 and ga∂a – ou ̊ranovÍ in Exhibit 2, line 769.) In fact, as will be seen in the exhibits below, “earth” and “heaven” serve as key-words throughout this section—a point to which we will return shortly. The next Homeric quotation, presented by Longinus as a self-contained unit, is really a conflation of  lines from two different theomachies in the Iliad: Exhibit 3 (Longinus 9.6) a ̊mfμ de; savlpigxen mevgaÍ ou ̊rano;Í | OußlumpovÍ te. 21.388 + 5.750 eßddeisen d∆ uÒpevnerqen aßnax ejnevrwn Â∑dwneuvÍ, 20.61 deÇsaÍ d∆ ejk qrovnou a®lto kaμ ≥ace, mhv o¥ [eßpeita]14 20.62 ga∂an a ̊narrhvxeie Poseidavwn ejnosÇcqwn, 20.63 o√kÇa de; qnhto∂si kaμ a ̊qanavtoisi faneÇh, 20.64 smerdalev∆ eu ̊r∫enta, tav te stugevousi qeoÇ per. 20.65 12. th;n oJrmh;n au ̊tΩn kosmikåÅ diasthvmati katametre∂ (9.5). 13.

The MSS of  Homer read u§perqen for eßpeita here. </page> <page sequence="4"> Longinus Chapter 9 295 What impresses Longinus about this passage is the way the poet depicts the cosmic repercussions brought about when gods make war: “You see, friend, how the earth is split to its foundations, hell itself  laid bare, the whole uni- verse sundered and turned upside down; and meanwhile everything, heaven and hell, mortal and immortal alike, share in the conflict and danger of  that battle.”15 Consider the details of  this conflation. Here, too, key-words and themes serve as triggers. Not only is there “earth” and “sky” here (underlined in Exhibit 3), in the preceding lines that Longinus does not quote in the theomachy from Book 20 we find Eris once again present (Il. 20.55): Exhibit 416 w¶Í tou;Í a ̊mfotevrouÍ mavkareÍ qeoμ ojtruvnanteÍ 20.54 suvmbalon, ejn d∆ au ̊to∂Í eßrida rJhvgnunto bare∂an. 20.55 deino;n d∆ ejbrovnthse path;r a ̊ndrΩn te qeΩn te 20.56 uÒyovqen: au ̊ta;r eßnerqe Poseidavwn ejtÇnaxen 20.57 ga∂an a ̊peiresÇhn ojrevwn t∆ a√peina; kavrhna, 20.58 pavnteÍ d∆ ejsseÇonto povdeÍ polupÇdakoÍ ¢IdhÍ 20.59 kaμ korufaμ Tr∫wn te povliÍ kaμ nhÅeÍ ÂcaiΩn 20.60 In the context surrounding the theomachy in Book 21, she also appears, along with earth and sky, twice (at Il. 21.385 and 390): Exhibit 5 au ̊ta;r ejpeμ Xavnqoio davmh mevnoÍ, oi ¶ me;n eßpeita 21.383 pausavsqhn: £Hrh ga;r ejruvkake cwomevnh per: 21.384 ejn d∆ aßlloisi qeo∂sin eßriÍ pevse bebriqu∂a 21.385 a ̊rgalevh, dÇca dev sfin ejnμ fresμ qumo;Í aßhto: 21.386 su;n d∆ eßpeson megavlå patavgå, bravce d∆ eu ̊re∂a cq∫n, 21.387 a ̊mfμ de; savlpigxen mevgaÍ ou ̊ranovÍ: aßie de; ZeuvÍ 21.388 h§menoÍ Ou ̊luvmpå, ejgevlasse dev o¥ fÇlon h®tor 21.389 ghqosuvn¬, o§ q∆ oJraÅto qeou;Í eßridi xuniovntaÍ 21.390 Another connection linking Exhibit 3 to the quotation in Exhibit 5 above is the first line there—a ̊mfμ de; savlpigxen mevgaÍ ou ̊rano;Í | OußlumpovÍ te—which is a conflation of  Il. 21.388 and 5.750.

Note, too, the presence of  the key-word “horses” in the portion of  text closely preceding the passage quoted in Exhibit 2: 15.

Moreover, the assumption behind branding the line in this way is that this “plus-verse” appeared in some text that Longinus or his source had in front of  him when he wrote this part of  his treatise, and that he (or his source) is simply re- producing this pre-Aristarchean textual accretion without thought. I would suggest, on the contrary, that the cognitive processes that produced so-called plus-verses in the first place are at work here as well. As we see from looking at the larger environment—looking, that is, to material that is contiguous or proximate, but not quoted—we see that one poetic environment is impinging upon another, related one. Such contextual “cross-fertilization” may also ex- plain the variant that Longinus has at the end of  Iliad 20.62 (see Exhibit 3 above)—eßpeita for the MSS’ u§perqen: is it purely accidental that we find a similar collocation of  sounds with the word eßpeita in the final position of the verse in the unquoted context of  Iliad 21 (oi ¶ me;n vs. mhv o¥—see Exhibit 5, line 383)?19 Longinus 9.8 presents us with another conflation, into which verse 60 from Iliad Book 20 has insinuated itself, and out from which a chunk of  lines we now have as Iliad 13.20–26 has fallen: Exhibit 6 (Longinus 9.8) kraipna; posμ probibavÍ: trevme d∆ oußrea makra; kaμ u§lh 13.18b kaμ korufaμ Tr∫wn te povliÍ kaμ nhÅeÍ ÂcaiΩn 20.60 possμn uÒp∆ a ̊qanavtoisi PoseidavwnoÍ √ovntoÍ. 13.19 bhÅ d∆ ejlavan ejpμ kuvmat∆, aßtalle de; khvte∆ uÒp∆ au ̊touÅ 13.27 pavntoqen ejk keuqmΩn, ou ̊d∆ hjgnoÇhsen aßnakta: 13.28 ghqosuvn¬ de; qavlassa dii?stato, toμ de; pevtonto. 13.29 Clearly, mention by name of  Poseidon shaking mountains in Exhibit 3 (line 63) helped bring this second example to mind. Concerning the presence here of  line 60, West himself  notes that “the similarity of  contexts has some- how caused L (if  not a predecessor who quoted both passages together) to transfer a line from one to the other.”20 But, again, when we look beyond the verses Longinus actually quotes, I think we can offer a more precise analysis: 18.

(I refer to the phrase the korufhÅÍ Savmou uÒlhevsshÍ in line 12.) Moreover, it is one thing to say that Priam’s city and the Achaean ships “appeared” to Poseidon as he looked out towards Troy from Samothrace, as Homer does in 13.14, but quite another to say, as the syntax of  the passage in Longinus’ quotation has it, that “the mountains, forests, and peaks—the Trojans’ city and ships of  the Greeks” (Exhibit 6, first three lines) all tremble at his approach. In creating this catalogue, fusing as it does Nature and Culture into one cosmic reaction to Poseidon’s epiphany, one might almost say that Longinus has made the sublimity of  the original even more sublime. Be that as it may, the collocation of  mountains and peaks is so rooted in the formula system that it was quite natural for Longinus to associate them—and even more natural for him to do so using a line from another context that he had just invoked moments earlier. But why are verses 20–26, the marvelous description of  the god’s four giant steps from Samothrace to Troy, omitted from the quotation, especially given the fact that Longinus has just drawn our attention to divine strides (those of  Hera’s horses) in an earlier example? West suggests that this may be just the reason for the omission; either that, he writes, or “the quotation has suffered abridgement in the transmission.”21 Another—I think better— explanation is that just as scenes in epic poetry typically undergo expansion and compression in composition and performance, so too in epic quotation.22 Exactly why this passage in Longinus was condensed here we shall never know, but I would point out that it is perfectly natural for anyone conversant with Homeric poetics who has just uttered the word √ovntoÍ (see Exhibit 6, Il. 13.19) to pick up the next line with a word in the same semantic register, bhÅ—just as natural, say, as when an aoidos or rhapsode follows a line like Iliad 20.61, beginning with eßddeisen, with the participle deÇsaÍ in the next, as in Exhibit 3.23 But what is even more fascinating in this regard is that 21. West 1995, 338. 22. On expansion and compression in oral and orally derived poetry, see Lord’s seminal discussion (1960, 102–23); for this same feature in Homeric poetics, see Martin 1989, 206–30. 23. For this habit of  composition in Homer, see Fehling 1969, 153–62. </page> <page sequence="7"> 298 M. D. Usher Longinus’ conflation of  theomachy material from Books 20 (Exhibit 3) and 21 (Exhibit 5) is itself  a compression—on a much larger scale, to be sure, yet also in its own way completely Homeric: it is, I suspect, no accident that Longinus is drawn in quotation to the very passages where Homer’s narrative of  the Theomachy is introduced, and then resumed after a long intermezzo that does not interest him (namely, various episodes in Achilles’ aristeia).24 In other words, whereas Homer expands Achilles’ aristeia with the Theo- machy in order to highlight the significance of  Achilles’ toil, Longinus squeezes Achilles’ aristeia out of  the picture completely by his conflated quotation. Both practices—expansion and compression—are among the most fundamental techniques of  the Homeric style.25 We come now to the quotation from Genesis: Exhibit 8 (Longinus 9.9) tauvt¬ kaμ oJ tΩn ∆IoudaÇwn qesmoqevthÍ ou ̊c oJ tucw;n a ̊nhvr, ejpeidh; th;n touÅ qeÇou duvnamin kata; th;n a ̊xÇan ejc∫rhse ka ̊xevfhnen, eu ̊qu;Í ejn t¬Å e√sbol¬Å gravyaÍ tΩn novmwn “eπpen oJ qeovÍ,” fhsÇ: tÇ... “genevsqw fΩÍ, kaμ ejgevneto: genevsqw ghÅ, kaμ ejgevneto.”26 This passage has been the subject of  much discussion and controversy ever since Boileau translated Longinus into French in 1674.27 It is often regarded as an interpolation, added by a zealous Christian reader. Others have suggested it was already in Longinus’ source, the earlier treatise on the sublime by Caecilius, a critic of  the Augustan period, said to be a Jew.28 West seeks to explain its presence here by tracing both it and all the Homer passages in this section to a Near Eastern poetic milieu, and he cites some very persuasive parallels from the gamut of  Ancient Near Eastern poetry and myth.29 West, I think, has in fact identified the deep structure of  this section. But what about its surface structure? 24. Note in particular (1) Il. 20.74—the context of  the quoted lines in Exhibit 3—where the river Xanthus and Hephaestus are the last gods to be paired off  in the roll call of  Theomachy participants, and (2) the resumption of  the scene at Il. 21.330 ( just before the verse that Longinus quotes in Exhibit 5), where these same two are the first gods to engage in battle, Hephaestus having been summoned by Hera to aid Achilles in his struggle with Xanthus. 25. See Edwards 1991, 11–23, 296–97 (also 286), though he uses terms like “anticipation,” “preparation,” and “ring-composition” to describe these features—see further his discussion ad 20.19–23 and 20.44–48; cf., too, Richardson’s remarks (1993, 85) ad Il. 21.383. An example of  compression and expansion from the Odyssey might make Homeric practice even more plain: the traditional hospitality type-scene is expanded considerably in the account of  Telemachus’ visits to Nestor and Menelaus in Books 3 and 4, but compressed to only a few lines in the mention of  his visit, en route from one to the other, at Diocles’ palace in Pherae (Od. 3.487–90 = Od. 15.185–88, with Reece 1993, 193). 26. “So, too, the lawgiver of  the Jews, no ordinary man, having formed a worthy conception of  divine power, gave expression to it at the very threshold of  his Laws where he says: ‘God said’—what? ‘ “Let there be light,” and there was light. “Let there be earth,” and there was earth’ ” (trans. Fyfe). 27. Cf. Russell 1964, 92: “hardly anything in L. has so caught the fancy of  readers.” On the immediate, seventeenth-century response in French letters, see Brody 1958, 50–51 and 90–91 and Maurer 1979, 234 and 247. 28. See Russell, 1964, 92–94; on Caecilius, see Roberts 1897. Berg, however, notes this passage was familiar enough to educated Greek audiences to have attracted the attention of  Galen and Numenius (2005, 115; cf. Tieleman 2005). 29. West 1995, 338–42. </page> <page sequence="8"> Longinus Chapter 9 299 First, a general observation, by way of  reminder: all the passages that Longinus has quoted thus far deal with the gods’ supernatural traits and the cosmic repercussions of  their fighting and epiphanies. The involvement in their divine struggle of  the sea, the earth, and the underworld, and of  moun- tains, which quake under the feet of  the participants, are all traditional elements in poetic descriptions of  the Titanomachy, and of  Zeus’ battle with Typhoeus.30 As we have seen, these same motifs (and the words used to express them) also help bind Longinus’ various Homer quotations together. Zeus’ battle with Typhoeus in particular, while not quoted or specifically alluded to by Longinus here, provides an additional clue (as we shall see) to understanding why perhaps the quotation from Genesis appears where it does amongst these Homeric passages. If  we look at the last thing mentioned in the Homer quotation in Exhibit 6 we find the sea and its parting with joy before its lord, Poseidon (ghqosuvn¬ de; qavlassa dii?stato). The locus classicus for parting seas in the Hebrew tra- dition is, of  course, the parting of  the Red Sea by Moses, and it so happens that the Septuagint rendering of  Exodus 15.8, the triumphal song (åjdh)v  sung by Moses and the Israelites after their escape from Egypt, speaks of  water being parted in rather similar terms:31 Exhibit 9 (Exodus 14:27–15:10 LXX) ∆Exevteine de; MwushÅÍ th;n ce∂ra ejpμ th;n qavlassan, kaμ a ̊pekatevsth to; u§dwr . . . kaμ ejxetÇnaxe KuvrioÍ tou;Í A√guptÇouÍ mezo;n thÅÍ qalavsshÍ . . . tovte ¬®se MwushÅÍ kaμ o¥ u¥oμ ∆Israh;l th;n åjdh;n tauvthn tåÅ QeåÅ, kaμ eπpan, levgonteÍ çßswmen tåÅ KurÇå . . . appon kaμ a ̊nabavthn eßrriyen e√Í qavlassan . . . dia; pneuvmatoÍ touÅ qumouÅ sou dievsth to; u§dwr . . .

Rather, he approximates the wording (in admittedly tangled syntax—see Exhibit 8) of  Genesis chapter 1, verses 3 and 9.34 It is 30. Edwards (1991, 293–94) neatly summarizes the literature on this topic and analyzes the relevant ancient passages (three are from Hesiod). 31. This passage, along with the subsequent Song of  Miriam (Exodus 15.20–21) and the Song of  Deborah in Judges 5, happens to be the oldest piece of  Hebrew poetry preserved in the Hebrew bible (see Propp 1998, 482). 32. “And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the water returned to its place . . . and the Lord shook off  the Egyptians in the midst of  the sea . . . Then sang Moses and the children of  Israel this song to God, and spoke, saying, Let us sing to the Lord . . . horse and rider he has thrown into the sea . . . And by the breath of  thine anger the water parted asunder . . . Thou sentest forth thy wind, the sea covered them . . .” (trans. Brenton). 33. In this regard, note the verbal correspondence between Exhibits 4 and 9 with tinavssw used of  both Yahweh and Poseidon. 34.

Usher important to note, however, that biblical scholars think that the language and imagery of  the Moses song in Exodus intentionally echoes the account of  creation in Genesis, where, “in the beginning,” the wind of  Yahweh hovers over the face of  the waters, and the god separates (diec∫risen) the waters above the firmament from the waters below it (Gen. 1:7).35 More to the point, however, is this: the creation account in Genesis is directly related to the Mesopotamian myth, recounted in the Babylonian creation story, Enuma Elish, about Marduk and Tiamat in which Marduk, the storm god, subdues Tiamat, the sea, splitting her in two by deploying an arsenal of  winds.36 West himself  notes the close taxonomic relationship of  Typhoeus to Tiamat in his monumental study of  Near Eastern elements in Greek poetry and myth,37 and the motivic and formulaic relationship of  the Greek Typhoeus myth to Greek gigantomachies and theomachies has, we have noted, already been well established.38 The creation story in Genesis, then, is not only a poetic moment of  cosmogony that appealed to Longinus’ sense of  the sublime, it is also, morphologically and historically, a cousin of  the theomachies he quotes (and notably conflates) from Homer.39 What triggered the Genesis quotation in such a context was, I suggest, the parting of  the sea at Poseidon’s approach to Troy (Exhibit 6, Il. 13.29). That this is not as wild a suggestion as it may seem,40 consider Longinus’ next quotation: diec∫risen oJ Qeo;Í a ̊na; mevson touÅ u§datoÍ, o¶ h®n uÒpokavtw touÅ stere∫matoÍ, kaμ a ̊na; mevson touÅ u§datoÍ, touÅ ejpavnw touÅ stere∫matoÍ.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of  the water, and let it be a division between water and water, and it was so.

Brenton].) 35. The connections are there in the Hebrew—see textual notes on the use of  tehomot “Deeps” and ruah “wind” at Exodus 15:5 and 8 (also used in the Creation account in Genesis) in Propp 1998, 472–73 and 520—but they are even more apparent in the LXX Greek (to which Longinus and other Hellenized readers would have had access): cf. dia; pneuvmatoÍ . . . dievsth . . . pneuÅma in the Exodus passage (Exhibit 9) with pneuÅma qeouÅ ejpefevreto ejpavnw tou u§datoÍ . . . diec∫risen . . . diacwrÇzon . . . diec∫risen in Genesis (Exhibit 10). In short, as Propp concludes in his extremely detailed commentary: “the Sea event [in Exodus] symbolically recapitulates Creation” (p. 523). On the specific motif  of  Yahweh “splitting” the sea in these two passages, see Propp 1998, 559. 36. See Pritchard 1969, 67. Bremmer calls attention to the dependence of  Greek creation myths on their ancient Near Eastern counterparts and proposes that the Genesis version is specifically dependent on Persian versions involving Ahura-mazda (Bremmer 2005, see esp. 74–77 and 90–96). Propp (1998, 558), while acknowledging the fundamental connection of  the Genesis and Exodus passages and their indebtedness to this Near Eastern “combat myth,” finds the account of  Yahweh’s activities in Genesis (these part of  the so-called “Priestly” source) more depersonalized. Other biblical versions of  this myth, e.g., in the Psalms and Prophets, are decidedly more anthropomorphic. 37. West 1997, 300–304. 38. See again Edwards 1991, 293–94. 39. This observation runs counter to the view, expressed recently by Averintsev, that the insertion of the Genesis passage represents an “historico-cultural misunderstanding” on the part of  Longinus (or his interpolator) in that the concept of  the sublime “is much too Greek a category to be able to characterize adequately the inner cast and pitch of  the biblical text, for there is too much aestheticism in it, too much cult of  culture and the pathos of  distance, which are totally foreign to the Bible” (Averintsev 2000, 14). 40. Mazzucchi (1992, 172) sees “una certa affinità” between the Genesis selection and the preceding Homeric passage insofar as both celebrate the god’s mastery over the elements, but he does not elaborate on this observation. </page> <page sequence="10"> Longinus Chapter 9 301 Exhibit 10 (Longinus 9.10) a ̊clu;Í aßfnw kaμ nu;x aßporoÍ au ̊tåÅ th;n tΩn ÔEllhvnwn ejpevcei mavchn: eßnqa dh; oJ A≥aÍ a ̊mh- canΩn “ZeuÅ pavter,” fhsÇn, “a ̊lla; su; rJuÅsai uÒp∆ hjevroÍ u∏aÍ ÂcaiΩn, poÇhson d∆ a≥qrhn, do;Í d∆ ojfqalmo∂sin √devsqai: ejn de; favei kaμ oßlesson” [= Il. 17.645–47b]. . . . ejpeidh; ejn a ̊pravktå skovtei th;n a ̊ndreÇan e√Í ou ̊de;n genna∂on eπce diaqevsqai, dia; tauÅt∆, a ̊ganaktΩn o§ti pro;Í th;n mavchn a ̊rge∂, fΩÍ o§ti tavcista a√te∂tai, wJÍ pavntwÍ thÅÍ a ̊rethÅÍ euÒrhvswn ejn- tavfion aßxion, ka ̇n au ̊tåÅ Zeu;Í a ̊ntitavtthtai.41 The quotation in this passage, from Iliad Book 17, follows directly upon the quotation from Genesis and was clearly triggered by the mention of light—not only by the word fΩÍ (used in the quotation and by Longinus in his discussion of  the passage), but also by light’s synonyms and necessary corollaries: night, darkness, and gloom (the relevant key-words are under- lined above). This passage, interrupted in the course of  quotation with an authorial fhsÇ, is Ajax’ heroic prayer to Zeus to destroy him, if  die he must, not in the gloom but in the light.42 Zeus’ response—in the part of  the larger passage not quoted by Longinus (lines 649–50)—is immediate (au ̊tÇka), decisive, and revealing. It is, in fact, an act of  creation worthy of  Yahweh himself: “He scattered the haze and pushed the mist aside,” the poet sings, “and the sun shone forth and the whole field of  battle was revealed” (au ̊tÇka d∆ hjevra me;n skevdasen kaμ a ̊pΩsen ojmÇclhn / hjevlioÍ d∆ ejpevlamye, mavch d∆ ejpμ paÅsa faavnqh). I do not want to push these parallels too far, but simply conclude by suggesting, as West does after presenting his evidence: “Perhaps L’s juxta- position of  Homer and Genesis in this section will now appear a little less strange.”43 At the very least, the way in which the Genesis and Homer quo- tations are integrated tells against the view that the biblical passage is an in- terpolation.44 Furthermore, the way Longinus’ quotations from Homer are concatenated reveals a deep familiarity with the themes, structures, and tech- niques of  Homeric poetry. That is, the author of  this treatise seems to be remembering and reproducing Homer’s poetry spontaneously, as a compos- ing poet or rhapsode might have done in performance. This is an important 41. “Suddenly he plunges the battle of  the Greeks into mist and helpless night. At his wits’ end Ajax cries: ‘Zeus Father, rescue from out of  the mist the sons of  Achaia, / Brighten the heaven with sunshine, grant us the sight of  our eyes. / So it be but in daylight, destroy us.’ . . . Since the ineffectual darkness robbed his courage of  all noble use, therefore, distressed to be idle in battle, he prays for light on the instant, hoping thus at the worst to find a burial worthy of  his courage, even though Zeus be ranged against him” (trans. Fyfe). 42. Köhnken (2002, 216, with reference to Longinus 17.2) adroitly relates this passage to Longinus’ larger aesthetic program, where light and shadow serve as a painterly metaphor for “die Wirkung und das Verhältnis von Natur (&gt;Größe&lt;) und Kunst (&gt;Figuren&lt;) in der Rede.” The Ajax passage is also, according to Köhnken, expressive of  Longinus’ view of  the poet’s relationship to his material: “Das Beispiel demonstriert also, nach Ps.-Longin, die mitreißende Größe des Aias ebenso wie die seines Schöpfers Homer” (p. 217). Yet, surprisingly, he says nothing about how the Genesis quotation also fits in with this same program. That it does adds further weight to the argument (again, contra Averintsev’s view of  the aesthetic in- compatability of  the Greek and biblical material—see n. 39 above) that the quotation is integral to this section. 43. West 1995, 342. 44. Mazzucchi (1992, 173) reaches a similar conclusion, but again, without elaboration; cf., too, Russell’s view, n. 2 above. Even if  the passage were an interpolation, the evidence presented here suggests that the interpolater was a perceptive reader who intuited Longinus’ modus operandi in composing this section. </page> <page sequence="11"> 302 M. D. Usher point to emphasize, for it contradicts the view that Longinus or his prede- cessor(s) merely gleaned these examples from secondary sources. The proposition that an author like Longinus could reproduce and re- combine Homeric verse in quotation in the Homeric manner should come as no surprise: if  Homeric poetry is indeed a generative linguistic system, that is, a langue, even if  an artificial one, developed over centuries to facilitate composition in a culture without writing, later users of  the system—even astute literary critics—are bound to show traces of  its characteristic features. Greek and Roman readers were, after all, reared on the recitation of  Homer. Longinus’ quotations reveal he was just such a reader himself. University of Vermont LITERATURE CITED Averintsev, S. 2000.
