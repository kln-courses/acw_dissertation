Carnegie Institution of Wash- ington Publication 530. By Arthur B. Drescher, E. L. Furlong, Ida S. DeMay, Paul C. Henshaw, Robert W. Wilson, Hildegarde Howard, and G. H. R. von Koenigswald. Carnegie Institution of Washington. Washington, D. C. $2.25 (paper); $2.75 (cloth). 91 x 6~; 222 + 31 plates. 1942. The first of these studies is by Drescher on the Later Tertiary Equidae from Tejon Hills, California (3 plates, 6 text figures). Recent collections from this area fur- nish sufficient evidence to permit reappraisal of earlier studies of the fossil horses of this region. Two groups of horses can now be defined, one from the lower, Santa Margarita, formation and the other from the overlying Chanac formation. Considerable data are added to the dentition records of Nannippus tehonensis (Mer- riam) from the Santa Margarita formation. From the Chanac formation is reported a new species of fossil horse, Pliohippus leardi. While no complete dental series of this species was found, a sufficient number of upper teeth were obtained to construct composite series. The next paper-A new Pliocene antelope from Mexico, with remarks on some known antilocaprids (2 plates, 1 text figure) is by Furlong. The new genus, Hexobelomeryx, which is described, "shows an unusual type of specialization of its horn cores, in which three distinct prongs are present." Ida S. DeMay follows with two papers, the first, Quaternary bird life of the McKittrick asphalt, California (4 text figures), and the second, Bird life on the Carpinteria asphalt, California (4 text figures). DeMay finds that the great abun- dance of falcons, buteonid hawks, and small owls from the McKittrick "strongly suggests that there was considerable open country in the region about the tar seeps in late Pleistocene time. The presence of nesting quail, doves, and road runners indicates particularly</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 269 the presence of chaparral-covered hiHlsides in the vicinity." The Carpinteria assemblage substantiates the view that the Carpinteria asphalt traps were sit- uated in a forested region. "Half of the species with known habitat preferences are those usually found in wooded areas, and more than a third have a preference for brushy regions. Of the six species represented by young birds as well as mature individuals, three are brush dwellers." The fifth paper in the series, and by far the longest, is by Henshaw on A Tertiary mammalianfaunafrom the San Antonio Mountains near Tonopah, Nevada (11 plates, 7 text figures). The presence of a saline lake and plains fauna give evidence of an Earid climate for this region. That the bones were not widely scattered and occurred in delta deposits along the shores of the lake further bears out the theory of the occurrence of occasional droughts. The mammalian fauna contains 19 species, 6 of which are known from no other locality. "The abundance of grazing horses (Mery- chippus) and antelopes, coupled with the occurrence of camels and long-limbed rhinoceroses, indicates without question that the environment was one of grassy, per- haps shrub-covered plains." The Equidae make up the bulk of the fossil remains. Teeth and foot bones are in great abundance but only a few and poorly pre- served vertebrae are found and no complete skulls. Two distinct groups are represented, the hypohippine (10 adult and 2 young) and the merychippine (100 adult and 10 young). Many of the systematic descrip- tions of the forms are accompanied by detailed dentition measurements, and where limb bones were available, measurements of these are given. The next paper is by Wilson on A preliminary study of the fauna of Rampart Cave, Arizona (4 plates, 1 text figure). The importance of this cave first became known in 1936. Two test pits have been dug in the floor of the cave which is composed of ground-sloth dung. These pits yielded a wealth of vertebrate fossils. Wilson gives a preliminary survey of this material which is in the collections of the museum in the National Park Service headquarters at Boulder Dam. For the present no further excavations at Rampart Cave will be undertaken. In the seventh paper Hildegarde Howard gives A review of the American fossil storks (1 plate, 2 text figures), while in the eighth and last paper, The South African man-apes and Pithecanthropus, von Koenigswald discusses the evidences which "dem- onstrate beyond any doubt that Pithecanthropus is a member of the human family." UPPER CRETACEOUS FLORAS OF THE RoCKY MOUNTAIN REGION. Contributions to Paleontology, Carnegie In- stitution of Washington Publication 508. By Erling Dorf. Carnegie Institution, Washington. $3.00 (cloth); $2.50 (paper). 11' x 9; 168 + 36 plates; 1942. This report is in two parts: (I) Stratigraphy and Palaeontology of the Fox Hills and Lower Medicine Bow Formations of Southern Wyoming and North- western Colorado (19 plates, 8 text figures); (II) Flora of the Lance Formation at Its Type Locality, Niobrara County, Wyoming (17 plates, 3 text figures). In the first part Dorf outlines the stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Medicine Bow formation and describes and discusses the fossil plants collected within the past two years from this formation. Collections were made from six localities, and for each of these regions detailed information is given concerning exact location and areal distribution of formations (with accompanying maps), position of faunas, floras, and coal beds (illustrated by measured sections), and complete lists of fossil plants found. There is also given in chart form changes in interpretation of the strati- graphic sequence beginning with 1907, when the earliest geological studies of the region were made, to the present time when Dorf gives his own interpretation. A total of 64 recognizable forms is reported of which 47 are referred to as species previously described by others, 11 are described as new species, and 6 are re- corded as not specifically determinable. They are distributed as follows: Dicotyledonae, 45 species; Monocotyledonae, 8 species; Coniferales, 2 species; Equisetales, 1 species; Filicales, 3 species; and 5 species whose position is uncertain. Three localities furnished a sufficient number of specimens for quantitative leaf counts to be made. These sho'wed the most abundant leaves to be those of Ficus planicostata. A study of leaf character (margin, length, nervation, texture, or- ganization, dripping point) showed that the Medicine Bow flora "is distinctly not a cool temperate assemblage, but is intermediate in character between warm tem- perate and subtropical, more nearly approaching the latter." In the second part of the study the author limits his report "to the description and discussion of plants known definitely to have come from the Lance forma- tion at its type locality." Earlier work in the area is reviewed, the stratigraphy outlined, fossil plants listed for each locality and the composition of the flora dis- cussed. Seventy forms are reported, falling among 32 families as follows: Dicotyledonae, 55 species; Mon- ocotyledonae, 6 species; Coniferales, 2 species; Gink- goales, 1 species; Lycopodiales, 1 species; Equisetales, 1 species; Filicales, 4 species. Of these, 56 forms are referred to species previously known, 5 are described as new species, and 9 are given generic designation but are not specifically determinable. Quantitative analysis was not particularly satisfactory since none of the localities in the Lance Creek area yielded more than 280 specimens. An analysis of leaf characters and a comparison of the generic and specific fossil and living forms of the region point to humid lowland conditions</page><page sequence="3">270 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of growth under a warm temperate to subtropical cli- mate, more nearly approaching the former. "For purposes of correlation the Lance formation at its type locality is made the basis of a new pro- vincial time term, 'Lancian age.' This time unit is regarded, on the basis of the stratigraphic position and palaeontology of the type Lance formation, as latest Cretaceous, i.e., post-Montanan and pre- Paleocene." In both parts of the monograph the systematic de- scriptions of the fossil forms are accompanied by very fine plates. The work concludes with an index of genera and species. GENETICS SYSTEMATICS AND THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist. By Ernst Mayr. Columbia University Press, New York. $4.00. 9 x 5'; xiv + 334; 1943. In this book, Mayr has made an excellent and very lucid synthesis of the contributions of modem syste- matics to the problem of speciation. The book is based on studies of the systematics of birds though studies of other groups are treated more briefly. This emphasis on one group has the disadvantage that it leads at times to somewhat one-sided conclusions with which stu- dents of other groups might not agree. However, it has the distinct advantage that the conclusions are based on one of the taxonomically best studied groups. The book is written from the point of view of the so- called "new systematics" in which the emphasis is on infraspecific variation and the evolution of species as opposed to the so-called "old systematics" in which emphasis is more frequently placed on the identification and cataloging of species. Mayr points out that this point of view has been applied primarily in investiga- tions of well-known groups and that of necessity it has been little applied in poorly known groups. It is most successful in groups in which most of the species are already known. A discussion of the origin of species is necessarily greatly influenced by the species concept employed. Mayr employs a "biological" species concept. He states: "Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are repro- ductively isolated from other such groups." This definition has the advantage that it is based on a char- acteristic, reproductive isolation, which is fundament- ally involved in the process of speciation rather than on morphological or other characteristics which might be considered more as biproducts of the process. How- ever, as Mayr points out, it is not always easy to use in practice and as a consequence it must often be left to the judgment of the taxonomist whether reproductive isolation has really been established. While Mayr realizes this, it seems to the reviewer that he has not taken it sufficiently into account in some of his dis- cussions of individual cases. With such a definition, morphological difference is no longer a sufficient criterion for species delimitation. As a consequence, different populations of the same species may differ morphologically from one another. Mayr points out the value of such a polytypic species concept in simplifying taxonomy. He shows the considerable reduction in the number of recognized species, particularly monotypic species, that has come about in recent years through the application of this concept. Mayr devotes considerable space to geographic variation. He discusses in some detail various phe- nomena such asRassenkreise, etc. Great stress is laid on geographic isolation as a first step in speciation. Mayr is inclined to believe that other kinds of isolating factors play little r6le in these first steps, at least in animals. However, he points out that no final conclusion can be reached in this matter. It seems to the reviewer that cases of adaptive radiation in lakes and other isolated areas present serious difficulties for this point of view despite the fact that Mayr points out that some of them can be explained on the basis of original geographic isolation. In one of the longest chapters, Mayr discusses "The biology of speciation". Special emphasis is laid on various isolating mechanisms that may serve to sepa- rate one species from another. Here, as elsewhere, no detailed discussion of genetic mechanisms is given since these have been discussed in other works. However, Mayr shows that he is thoroughly familiar with the contributions of modem genetics to the study of evo- lution. The final chapter discusses rather briefly the higher categories of classification. Mayr concludes that these higher categories are, unlike species, primarily subjective units though they are based on the objective fact thatall species are not equally distinct from one another. A discussion is also given of the various factors involved in macroevolution and the way in which these factors can be used to explain various macroevolutionary phenomena. This discussion shows that it is at least theoretically possible to explain macroevolution in the same terms as microevolution. The book is very clearly and logically written. This, together with the author's obvious familiarity with fields of biology other than his own, should make this work of great value in bringing about a better under- standing of the contributions of systematics to evolu- tionary theory and in facilitating the synthesis of the results of different lines of investigation into a unified and logical picture. It should be read by all who are interested in the problems of evolution.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 271 ANiMAL BREEDING PLANS. By Jay L. Lush. Iowa State College Press, Amnes, Iowa. $3.50. 91 x 64; viii+437; 1943. The study of animal husbandry has been substantially elevated and clarified by the appearance of this excellent text. In a precise and authentic manner, the author has discussed the origin, genetics, and the merits and possibilities of the various accepted procedures of im- provement of the races of domestic animals (including fur-bearing animals, bees and silk-worms). After a brief analysis of the history of animal breed- ing methods and the mendelian mechanism of inheri- tance, the genetic basis of variation is discussed in the light of modern statistical procedure. The balance of the volume is devoted to the consideration of methods available for the improvement of animal stocks, namely, selection, inbreeding, and outbreeding, and carefully points out the merits and faults of each method in rela- tion to the improvement desired. The author makes a plea for animal breeders to set up a definite plan of procedure concomitant with a definite goal (e.g. improved body appearance for show work, improved body size and flesh texture for meat produc- tion, improved physiological attributes for the produc- tion of superior quality and quantity of wool, milk, eggs, etc.), before attempting to improve the race or strain of animals. The recommended plan is (1) to decide what type or kind of animal is nearest the ideal for a given characteristic; (2) to find which animals have the most perfect hereditary record with respect to the desired qualities; (3) to get the animals that most nearly meet the phenotypic and genotypic ideals for a given trait and set them to reproducing at rates pro- portional to their perfection of heredity; and (4) to hold on to, and closely line-breed the most perfect indi- viduals obtained. Time, patience, and careful selec- tion and breeding are indicated as equally important ingredients in the success of any attempted program of animal improvement. Each chapter carries a list of references pertinent to the discussions presented therein, as well as numerous formulae and tabular material. A short index is provided. GENETICS FOR MEDICAL SU1DENTS. By E. B. Ford. Methuen and Company, London. 7s. 6d. 71 x 43; 162; 1942. Of all textbooks of genetics, Ford's Genetics for Medical Students is probably the one that follows least a tradi- tional ciche. Only too often a textbook of genetics has been a juxtaposition of independent chapters. Ford's new book makes of the principles of genetics a coherent story, in which the different aspects of genetics are bound together by a well thought through plan d'en- semble. The book is a response to the growing demand for genetic knowledge among medical students and physi- cians. This no doubt has helped the author in selecting the method of presentation and the material. The latter again is rather unusual: to make the book more attractive to the particular type of reader for whom it has been written, the examples illustrating the basic principles of genetics have been selected, so far as pos- sible, among the material of human genetics. Even Mendel's first and second laws are illustrated by crosses involving human characters. Significantly the index contains only nine references to Drosophila and none to maize. Not only examples from man are preferably selected, but throughout the book emphasis is placed on the facts and methods of particular importance for the study of human genetics. The book is divided into six chapters: I. Mendelian heredity; II. The genetics of sex; III. Mutation and the nature of heredity; IV. The action of the genes; V. Polymorphism; VI. Methods of study in human genetics. A basic knowledge of cytology is assumed: consequently the usual description of the "physical basis of heredity" will not be found in the book, except in the form of a condensed summary, in an appendix. A second appendix provides the reader with a classified list of some human genes. The book will hardly be regarded as a full-fledged textbook. To fulfill that function it is too short, too poorly illustrated, somewhat too general and lacks the traditional list of problems which proves so useful in the teaching of genetics. It is to be considered rather as an introduction to a more detailed study of human genetics and as such it will undoubtedly be successful. FAMILY TREASURES. A Study of the Inheritance of Normal Characteristics in Man. By David D. Whitney. Jaques Cattell Press, Lancaster, Pa. $3.50. 9' x 63; 299; 1942. The author has attempted to write a popular account of human inheritance based primarily on normal varia- tions. To do this he has made use of a large collection of photographs, often of several generations of a family. The text is built around these photographs. Unfortunately the text does not live up to the ex- cellence of the figures. Whitney has attempted to dispel superstitious beliefs concerning birthmarks, ma- ternal impressions, etc.; but he has substituted in their place another kind of superstition. Anyone reading his book without previous acquaintance with genetics would certainly come to the conclusion that any char- acteristic found in more than one member of a family is thereby shown to be inherited. Whitney makes no distinction between characters whose inheritance has been clearly shown and those whose inheritance is doubtful or improbable. For example he makes the statement that good taste in dress is inherited and</page><page sequence="5">272 THIE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY presents four photographs to illustrate it. Whitney does not state how he evaluated this ability, but it is to be doubted that everyone would agree that his choice of photographs was completely fortunate. This ab- solutely uncritical, frequently naive, attitude char- acterizes the whole book. There is nothing that would give the reader a satisfactory idea of even the most elementary genetic principles or of the careful methods so essential in the study of human inheritance. There is certainly no excuse for such a completely uncritical, indeed misleading, book. It is highly unfortunate that this important subject has been presented to the general reader in this way. GENERAL BIOLOGY THE OCEANS: Their Physics, Chemistry, and General Biology. By H. V. Sverdrup, Martin W. Johnson, and Richard H. Fleming. Prentice-Hall, Inc., New York. $10.00; Text edition, $8.00. 9 x 6; x + 1077 + 8 folding charts; 1942. This volume, by three staff members of the world's leading institution for oceanographic study, is the most comprehensive treatise ever compiled dealing with this subject. Some years ago when the senior author was lecturing before the American Association for the Advancement of Science the chairman who introduced him stated that he would speak about the biggest thing in the world-the ocean. A book dealing with such a subject cannot help but be bulky, and this volume will disappoint no one in this respect. There is a certain type of mind to which the statement that the foreign circulation of this book has been prohibited by the Federal Government will be more impressive than the differential equations that are so generously scattered throughout its pages. It is true that it makes a definite contribution to the war effort, but to attempt its appraisal on that basis would be a most inappropriate way to evaluate its importance, for its contribution to the arts of peace is even more significant. Long before the present holocaust became inevitable the experi- mentation and observation on which the book is based was under way. It is the fruit of the pursuit of truth- of a sincere search for knowledge of what goes on in that little understood domain beneath the surface of the sea. Throughout the ages man has stood in awe before the sea. The land he could subdue and survey, he could even remove mountains if he had adequate faith, but the sea defied him wherever he encountered it. Homer thought it was a river that flowed around the world; Pytheas and Leif Ericson ploughed its uncharted surface on their way to discover new lands, in ignorance of what lay beneath their keels; Jules Verne speculated about it and wrote one of the most remarkable novels of all time; and Anton Rubenstein dedicated to it the lengthiest symphony in musical literature; but the combined knowledge of all of these is not so great as that which an intelligent reader might glean from a careful perusal of this book. Not that any such reader will have an easy task; the book is frankly intended for the trained specialist, but many of its less esoteric passages shed light on those questions which inevitably arise in the mind of anyone who has stood "gazing with a timid glance On the ocean's broad expanse." It is now universally believed that life originated in the ocean. Not only does sea water resist sudden changes in temperature, salinity, and alkalinity, but it holds in solution all those substances which enter into the chemical composition of living matter. In fact, the chemical content of sea water is practically identical with that of the body fluids of marine animals generally, and has the same osmotic pressure. It is also so similar to the blood of the terrestrial animals as to lead to the belief that the latter represents the condition of the sea water at the time when the ancestors of the terrestrial animals first emerged from the ocean to seek a new life on the land. The most influential factors in the distribution of plants and animals in the ocean are light and tempera- ture, respectively. Below the level to which sunlight can penetrate there can be no photosynthesis, and con- sequently no vegetable life except that of the anaerobic bacteria. An excellent illustration of this is the Black Sea, which is more than 2000 meters deep. The Straits of the Bosphorus are only 40 meters in depth, and this effectively precludes the entrance of oxy- genated water from the Mediterranean. The only water that the Black Sea receives is mostly from the Danube and Don rivers, so that aeration by convection currents is reduced to a minimum and what little oxygen there may be is exhausted by the decomposition of organic matter accumulated on the bottom, and the lower 1800 meters is so highly toxic that it cannot sup- port animal life of any kind. The depth to which light can penetrate is approxi- mately the level of the continental shelf, so there can be no vegetable life on the continental slope. But ocean currents and the vertical displacement of water from other causes brings sufficient oxygen to the slope to support animal life which subsists on the continuous precipitation of planktonic material from the surface layers of the sea. The phytoplanktonic forms have a specific gravity slightly greater than that of sea water, and mostly have no power of locomotion, so that they are always de- scending to the depths. The rate of this descent into the abyss is very slow-due in part to the friction be- tween the water and the surface area of the organism. Although the phytoplankton consists of extremely minute organisms, the surface areas of these forms are quite large in proportion to their weight. In certain</page><page sequence="6">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 273 local areas there is an upwelling of water from the depths, and this is frequently sufficient to overcome the sinking tendency, otherwise the phytoplankton might have been exterminated long ago. It is well known that animals living in the darkness of subterranean caverns tend to lose their eyes and their pigmentation. But the nektonic forms from below the limit of light penetration generally are heavily pig- mented and have well-developed eyes. This unex- pected condition seems to be related to the presence of luminescent organs which are of common occurrence among abyssal forms but unknown in cave fauna. That such luminescence is ever strong enough to reveal non-luminescent organisms by reflected light, however, seems unlikely. There is a great difference between the animal and vegetable kingdoms as to the number of their phyletic groups represented in the marine flora and fauna. Of the seventeen phyla of animals five are exclusively marine and none lacks marine representation. But with one strange exception all marine plants are algae. The one exception is the eel grass, a true flowering plant whose root is attached near mean low water level. At high tide the eel grass is entirely submerged. The reviewer puts down this book rather reluctantly, regretting that lack of space precludes more than mere mention here of such matters as the tides, ocean cur- rents, distribution of temperature and salinity, plank- ton, the Sargasso Sea, sedimentation, Globigerina ooze, coral reefs, inter-relations of organisms, etc., to mention a few at random. The science of oceanography is still young, and our knowledge of many special phases of it has been acquired during the most recent years. What we know today about it is but a drop in the bucket (or shall we say, in the ocean?) as compared to what we have still to learn. The sea is still the symbol of the mystery, and the increments of our knowledge about it are like islands, surrounded by the unknown. As we complete the survey of each island we realize more com- pletely the meaning of Rosetti's words "Leagues beyond those lands there is more sea." , BIOLOGY SEASON BY SEASONfor Catholic Schools. By Sister Mary Anthony Payne. American Book Company, New York. $2.32. 84 x 54; xi + 675; 1942. "The beautiful quotation from the Book of Genesis gives us a reasonable and acceptable explanation of the origin of matter, form, and life-vegetative life, animal life, and rational life." Thus, fully armed and substantially supported by the Bible (wonderful document that it is) the author pre- sents a somewhat biased picture of biology for the consumption of high school students of the Catholic faith. It is true that the volume is unique in organiza- tion, and based upon sound pedagogical principles (the materials are arranged so that the student will be studying the various biological forms and interesting biological processes during that part of the year with which they are most logically identified), but it is unique also in the reticence and ambiguity with which such topics as sex, reproduction, and evolution are presented. Of course, no other theory on the origin of life and matter is given except the one quoted above. Except for the above limitations, the biological principles expounded are essentially sound, the illus- trations adequate, though at times irrelevant (e.g. p. 492), and the overall bearing of the text is acceptable. In spite of the handicap of biased selection and pre- sentation of subject matter, the careful student should be able to obtain a working knowledge of biology from these pages. A complete glossary and index are appended. HUMAN BIOLOGY TABOO: A Sociological Study. By Hutton Webster. Stanford University Press, Stanford; Oxford University Press, London. $4.00. 9 x 6; xii + 393; 1942. Webster gives the following definition of taboo: "Taboos are prohibitions which when violated, produce auto- matically in the offender a state of ritual disability- 'taboo sickness'-only relieved, when relief is possible, by a ceremony of purification." On this basis he describes briefly hundreds of taboos concerning the reproductive life (menstruation, pregnancy, birth, mis- carriage, twins); concerning the separation of sexes in eating, work and worship; and those taboos concerning sexual intercourse, common, premartial, adulterous and incestuous. He collects the taboos concerning death and the dead, widows and killers, the taboos concerning strangers and strange phenomena, sacred things and persons. He eventually discusses the economic aspects of taboo (tabooing of property, certain foods and seasons, etc.). It is obvious that among these hundreds of cases it may be questioned whether some really belong in the field outlined by the author's definition of taboo. It is clear too that even such a very extensive study is not and cannot be "complete" in listing all the relevant cases out of a really gigantic ethnographic literature. Webster neither discusses the existing theories of taboo (Frazer, Marett, Freud, Wundt, Lehmann, etc.), nor has he one of his own. But one has the definite impression that, in spite of recognizing positive by- products of taboos, to him taboos are mere supersti- tions. This is not surprising as Webster's present book as well as the Primitive Secret Societies (1908) and Rest Days (1916) use the same technique as the famous "comparative" books of Frazer, Westermarck, Sumner- Keller, and Crawley, which in their approach were fundamentally rationalistic and evolutionistic. Mod-</page><page sequence="7">274 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY erA anthropology is very far from this technique and approach, but for the rapid survey of a field, for reference purposes, these books as well as Hasting's Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics are still valuable storehouses of knowledge. Here lies also the main strength of this book, all the more as Webster has also very conscientiously gone through the extensive and brilliant field work of the last 30-40 years, which was not available to any of his predecessors. From Webster's survey one gains the impression that the situations most apt to produce taboos are those of death and sex life-two not only socially decisive, but also eminently biological situations. It is thus not surprising that among these taboos, essentially social institutions, we find a good many which present a chal- lenge to the biologist for further research: e.g. the case of tribes where taboos admit sexual intercourse exclu- sively during the menstruation period, or the perplexing cases where death and sickness are not only explained but actually produced by taboo transgression. MAN'S POOR RELATIONS. By Ernest Hooton. Doubleday, Doran and Company, New York. $5.00. 9 x 61; xl + 412; 1942. The term "man's poor relations", as used by the author, embraces the lemurs, tarsiers, New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and anthropoid apes. These animals, together with man, comprise the mam- malian order Primates. The title of this book might well have seemed appropriate in the lush nineteen- twenties; but to-day one is inclined to wonder wherein these so-called "lower primates" are "poor"-unless it be in that cerebral deficiency that denies them the blessings of civilization and the luxury of total world war. Despite the seeming impropriety of its title, let it be said at once that this book is one for which all biologists should be grateful. They should be espe- cially grateful to Hooton for having compressed into 400 pages-and in a most felicitous manner-a fair share of the existing knowledge of primates other than man. The scientific literature that treats of these animals is truly vast, and the author's task has been Gargantuan. Nearly one half of the book (176 pages) is devoted to the anthropoid apes, 55 pages to the monkeys of the Old World, 42 pages to those of the New World, 9 pages to the tarsiers, and 35 pages to the lemurs. This un- equal treatment to a large extent is a measure of our knowledge of the several primate groups. The closing secfion of the book (62 pages) is strictly comparative, dealing with selected topics-social organization, blood, brain, skeletal proportions, and teeth. The volume, however, does not attempt to be all- embracing, for some subjects receive either scant mention or even none at all, whereas others are dealt with at lengths that may appear disproportionate. Obviously the author has made no effort to be truly comprehensive in his treatment of the subject, but has been guided chiefly by his own fancy. Thus the psychological aspect of primates, dealing with social behavior and the like, covers many pages; while the treatment of morphology is sketchy and unbalanced. The professional student of primates will encounter a number of errors in the text, but none of these are of a major character. Considering the task to which the author has set himself, they are in fact remarkably inconsiderable. Hooton has produced a unique book, written in his customary lively and attractive manner. For this reason, but also for its intrinsic worth and usefulness, it will recommend itself to all persons interested in man the animal. YALE UNIVERSITY PUBLICATIONS IN ANTHROPOLOGY. No. 25; The Ciboney Culture of Cayo Redondo, Cuba, by Cornelius Osgood; No. 26; Archeology of the Maniabon Hills, Cuba, by Irving Rouse. Yale University Press, New Haven; Oxford University Press, London. $3.50. 9- x 7; No. 25, 65 + 6 plates; No. 26, 184 + 8 plates + 1 folding map; 1942 (paper). This publication is a result of the collaboration between the Caribbean Program of the Yale Peabody Museum and the Institute of Andean Research. Osgood has excavated a midden on Cayo Redondo, a small island in a mangrove swamp bordering the Bay of Guadiana on the north coast of the Peninsula of Guana- hacabibes, which comprises the western-most extremity of Cuba. He found mostly shell and stone implements; shell gouges (peculiar for Cuba); shell cups; stone hammer grinders, as they are found all over the West Indies and in the adjacent parts of North and South America; stone picks and the wide-spread stoneballs (of ceremonial use?). The findings on Cayo Redondo make part of a nearly unitary culture. In their simplicity they seem to emanate from "Ciboney" people, as archeologists now call the non-pottery people which preceded the Arawak and Caribs in the West Indies. The study by Rouse is a survey of the previous re- search in the Maniabon Hills in eastern Cuba. The publication of Rouse's own work in the Maniabon Hills is still deferred. The author gives a succinct and very interesting survey of the history of Cuba and especially the Maniabon Hills, insofar as the Indian population is concerned. He gives a detailed study of archeological exploration in the Maniabon Hills which since 1860 has been rather extensive. He describes 190 sites, also artifacts not allocated according to site. Of the sites, 14 are "Ciboney" while the overwhelming majority</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 275 (113) is "Sub-Taino" (Arawak). The "Sub-Taino" sites are divided into 74 villages, 8 camps, and 39 caves. They contain mostly pottery, but also implements made from stone, bone, and shell. The relationships of Maniabon culture with surrounding areas (Haiti, far eastern Cuba, southern and western Cuba) is discussed. Rouse's synthesis of very much dispersed material will be of the highest value to all those who are interested in American archeology. YOUNG OFFENDERS: An Enquiry into Juvenile Delin- quency. By A.

It is readily observed that there is likely to be an increase in juvenile delinquency during and imme- diately after a war. But it is difficult to make a con- vincing investigation of delinquency at such times because appropriations for activities that do not contribute directly to the war effort are likely to be drastically curtailed to the point of inefficiency. In the present instance it was found impossible to assemble sufficient information about delinquent girls to justify their inclusion in the present investigation. The outstanding conclusion that can be drawn from a study of delinquent boys in London and seven other English towns is that a boy from a broken home is about six times as likely to become delinquent as one from a normal home, and it makes little difference in the de- linquency rate whether the home was broken by death or divorce, or whether the parents were unmarried. The age at which most children become delinquent is thirteen. Now it so happens that the number of thirteen-year-old children in England at the time these statistics were compiled was significantly greater than it would have been had the birth rate been constant over a period of years. But the authors have devised a technique which takes into consideration the popula- tion of the various age groups as a whole so that it is not possible to attribute the high incidence of delin- quency at this age to the fluctuating birth rate. Another fact brought out by this investigation is that children who are active in school, church, or club are less likely to become delinquent than those who are not. The book is well written, and contains a lengthy summary of all previous investigations of delinquency. We need more published reports of this sort, and larger appropriations to make them possible. X,/ THE NATIVE TRIBES oF EASTERN BOLIVIA AND WEST- ERN MATTO GRosso. Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 134. By Alfred Metraux. Smithsonian Institution, Wash- ington, D. C. 35 cents. 91 x 57; 182 + 5 plates; 1942 (paper). Metraux who has himself done important field work in South America, has collected in this little volume the essential facts known about two score of tribes living in Eastern Bolivia and Western Matto Grosso, that is, in the very heart of the South American continent. Such a survey will be all the more welcome as most of the sources (going back partly to the Spanish conquest) are not written in English and are difficult of access. In spite of the fact that Metraux had to build on very incomplete foundations, the book gives a wealth of very important data, especially in the field of material culture-agriculture, hunting and fishing techniques, road-building, curare preparation, construction of musical instruments, etc. The study is historical and comparative, but M6traux fortunately avoids the com- plete dissolution of culture organisms into isolated "traits", characteristic of the still valuable study of the late Erland Nordenski6ld on the same region (The Ethnography of South America seen from Mojos in Bolivia; Comparat. Ethn. Studies 3; Goteborg, 1924). A very good bibliography is given, but unfortunately no index, which would be very desirable in view of the many synonymous tribal names. The reviewer feels also that a short geographico-historical introduction would greatly improve the excellent little book, espe- cially if it would eventually help in answering the problem of depopulation of this region, which, oddly enough, all investigators mention but so far no one has attempted to explain. THE JAPANESE. Smithsonian Institution War Back- ground Studies, Number Seven: Publication 3702. By John F. Embree. Smithsonian Institution, Wash- ington, D. C. Free. 9 x 6; iv + 42; 1943 (paper). The people of Japan have suddenly forced themselves upon the attention of a nation whose citizens have known little or nothing of them in the past, or have generally regarded them as quaint Gilbert and Sullivan folk in kimono who could never really learn how to fly an airplane. We have learned to our dismay the error of this attitude. In the pages of this little book, a brief account is given of the beginnings and present social structure of the Japanese nation. It is readily demon- strated that there is nothing "mysteriously oriental"- about the Japanese. Like other human beings, their thoughts and acts are conditioned by early training and cultural environment, and the better these are under- stood, the better the behavior of the people may be understood and predicted. Because the author feels that most people are already familiar with them, descriptions of material culture, such as house types and clothing, have been largely ignored in this back- ground study. The same applies to descriptive ac-</page><page sequence="9">276 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY coutts of Japanese art and literature. Instead, em- phasis is laid on the social and historical aspects of Japanese culture which are at once unfamiliar to Occidentals and of special importance in determining Japanese attitudes and behavior. Material here dis- cussed is divided into six main sections: origins, na- tional social structure, family and household, cycle of life, religion, and concluding remarks on cultural homogeneity and borrowing, and popular misconcep- tions regarding the Japanese. The series of sixteen excellently-reproduced plates greatly assist the average reader in his interpretation and understanding of the subject matter presented. The appendix gives in- teresting facts and figures about the Japanese and their empire. There is a list of references and a selected bibliography, but no index. This little volume is of especial significance at the present time and is heartily recommended to all. PoLYNEsIANs; Explorers of the Pacific. Smithsonian Institution War Background Studies, Number Six: Publication 3701. By J. E. Weckler, Jr. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. Free. 9 x 6; 77 + 20 plates; 1943 (paper). The Polynesians, who were the first human inhabitants of the farflung mid-Pacific islands, were the most daring deep-sea voyagers and explorers the world has ever known. In the double-hulled ships they fashioned with stone tools, they sailed by easy stages across the widest part of the unknown Pacific, from southeastern Asia probably all the way to the coast of Peru. They did this centuries before Columbus ventured into the Atlantic, even before the intrepid Vikings found their way gradually across the north Atlantic to the New World. The area discovered and populated by these seafarers is known as the Polynesian triangle. The word Polynesia itself means "many islands." The present account gives, in a clear and fascinating fashion, the remarkable story of these inhabitants of the mid- Pacific region. We are told about the ancient home- land from which the Polynesians probably came, their shipbuilding and seafaring activities, the new lands which they explored and settled, the beginnings of their religion and mythology, the great period of colonization, Polynesian ways of life, the coming of the Europeans, and life in Polynesia today. The many excellent plates offer illustrative material of a very high order and add immensely to the text for the average reader. There is a selected bibliography but no index. The appendix gives pertinent facts about the main island groups in Polynesia. The material here pre- sented in so lucid and entertaining a manner is of special interest at the present time in view of the daily war happenings in the Pacific theater of operations. SIAM-LAND OF FREE MEN. Smithsonian Institution War Background Studies, Number Eight. By H. G. Deignan. Smithsonian Institution, Wash- ington. Free. 98 x 68; 18; 1943 (paper). Siam-or Thailand as it is more properly called-is another country which has loomed large on the horizon in the present world conflict and one about which Americans in general have only meager and often mis- leading information. The present excellent account is an attempt to remedy this situation. The author discusses, in order: geography of the country, peoples, prehistory of the Siamese, and the kingdoms of Suk- hothai-Sawankhalok, Aynthia, Tonburi, and Siam, The book concludes with an interesting discussion of present-day (that is, pre-World War II) Thailand. The author states that "a lively resistance to the present Japanese usurpers continues inside Thailand and through her spokesmen abroad." He further believes that "we may confidently expect that the Thai, with the aid and sympathy of their friends of the United Nations, will at the earliest opportunity rid themselves both of their quislings and their Japanese overlords." This is certainly encouraging speculation and it is hoped that the author's predictions come true. The series of eight photographic plates, depicting scenes in modern-day Thailand are well chosen and serve a very useful purpose in illustrating the author's interesting and instructive presentation of the facts concerning this far-off "land of free men." There is neither bibliography nor index. To all who would become familiar with the background of the present conflict, this little book is an essential article for reading. YuRoK NARRATIVES. University of California Publica- tions in American Archaeology and Ethnology, Volume 35, No. 9. By Robert Spott and A. L. Kroeber. University of of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles. $1.25. 10- x 64, 143-256 + 1 map; 1942 (paper). This is a collaboration between two authors, both of whom are well qualified for the task. Robert Spott is a well-educated Yurok Indian, both in the practices and traditions of his own people and in those of the white man as well. The narratives are set down just as he told them to Kroeber, who has added comments of his own. In the introduction Kroeber states that some of the narratives are history, some mythology, and some, perhaps the most interesting of all, are a blend of both. The temptation is to compare this work with Sun Chief, also the product of cooperation between an Indian and a white man, reviewed in these pages some months ago. But the two books are not parallel. Sun Chief is an autobiography and the writer has endeavored to conceal the culture and folklore of his people. He discusses these matters only in order to</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 277 contradict the statements of an earlier writer. Robert Spott, on the other hand, is actuated by a desire to keep alive the traditions of his people; there is nothing in his contribution that is in any way autobiographical. The reader who endeavors to read between the lines is likely to conclude that different Indians react dif- ferently to the impact of white civilization. RAFINESQUE MEMORIAL PAPERS, October 31, 1940. Transylvania College Bulletin, Volume XV, No. '7. By Francis W. Pennell, Alfred Emerson and Others. Transylvania College, Lexington, Ky. 9 x 6; 108; 1942 (paper). In October, 1940, Transylvania College held commemo- rative exercises to mark the centennial of the death of Constantine Rafinesque (b. Constantinople, 1783 and d. Philadelphia, 1840), who for 6 years (1819-1825) served as Professor of Botany and Natural History (and for a time as Librarian) in that, at the time, young institution. The lectures presented at these meetings are here published. In the first, and longest, paper entitled "The Life and Work of Rafinesque," F. W. Fennell has succeeded in covering in an interesting manner and as briefly as possible a wide field, both of geography and of endeavor. Rafinesque not only travelled widely but his interests were in many direc- tions and he wrote on everything that interested him, whether it was botany, zoology, ichthyology, herpe- tology, archaeology, philology, economics or poetry. Fennell was fortunate in finding some hitherto unpub- lished material in the form of letters, daybooks of expenses and manuscripts from which he draws in an effort to shed new light on the private and public life of Rafinesque. The other, briefer, papers (some pub- lished in abstract only) deal with Rafinesque's con- tributions to the archeology of the United States east of the Mississippi, the biology of fishes, herpetology and medicinal plants. A list of publications by Rafinesque which have been deposited in the Transylvania Library is appended. CULTURE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTIONS: XXI. Round Valley. Anthropological Records, Volume 8, No. 1. By Frank Essene. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles. $1.00. 11 x 81; 97 + 1 map; 1942 (paper). CULTURE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTIONS; XXII. Plateau. Anthropological Records, Volume 8, No. 2. By Verne F. Ray. University of California Press, Berkeley. $1.75. 11 x 8"; iii + 99-258; 1942 (paper). These are some of the last culture element distribution lists which have been collected during recent years under the direction of Kroeber. The series will furnish the basis for a synthetic study of the Californian Indian such as it has never been possible to do for any group of Indians hitherto-although we were already fortunate in possessing Kroeber's fine Handbook of the Californian Indian. Essene lists and compares 2174 traits among the Lassik, Yuki, Kato, and Kalekau. He gives some interesting supplementary material concerning the Kato and Lassik. Ray compares the occurrence of 7633 traits among the Wenatchi, Kittitas, Sanpoil, Lower Chinook, Klikitat, Kalispel, Lillooet, Chilcotin, Shuswap, Lower Carrier, Kutinai, Flathead, Coeur d'Alene, Umatilla, Tenino, and Lower Thompson. HEADEHNTING IN THE SOLOMON ISLANDS around the Coral Sea. By Caroline Mytinger. The Macmillan Company, New York. $3.00. 8' x 58; ix + 416 + 8 plates; 1942. This is an entertaining account of a pre-war trip to the south-western Pacific by two young American women "headhunting" for portraits of primitive natives, particularly Melanesians. Judging by the few, well- reproduced samples of her paintings and by her num- erous facile sketches scattered through the text, the author is a most capable artist who has admirably succeeded in recording the characteristic figures and expressions of her exotic subjects. The many diffi- culties and hardships connected with transportation and accomodation to and in the Solomon Islands are vividly and humorously described. To induce ab- origines to pose for their portraits required enormous patience and ingenuity. To all those who now are eager to learn what life in Guadalcanal is like this book can be highly recom- mended as giving a frank and detailed picture from the layman's point of view. The biologist, however, will find disappointingly little of scientific value in the vol- ume besides the beautiful portraits of the natives. TEXTILE PERIODS IN ANCIENT PERU: II. Paracas Caverns and the Grand Necropolis. University of Cali- fornia Publications in American Archaeology and Eth- nology, Volume 39, No. 2. By Lila M. O'Neale. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles. 75 cents. 101 x 6x 143-202 + 5 plates; 1942 (paper). This analysis of textiles from two Paracas sites in Peru provides additional evidence for a similarity in tech- nique between the Necropolis collections and the weav- ings from Early-period Ica and Nazca Valley sites. The Caverns collection, on the other hand, exhibits a thorough knowledge of certain processes less charac-</page><page sequence="11">278 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY teristic of other early sites. Neither the gauzes nor the fabrications distinguish the textiles of any site studied up to this time to the same degree as those from the Caverns; this culture may therefore be the earliest yet known for ancient Peru. ZOOLOGY INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY oF ANIMAL PARASITES AND PARASITISM. By William A. Riley. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $1.50. 11 x 82; 87; 1942 (paper). This is not a textbook, but a syllabus that has developed from information furnished to the author's students at the University of Minnesota. Its major purpose is to serve as a guide for introducing the student to the field of parasitology. Although human parasitology is emphasized, many of those parasites of domestic and wild animals are dis- cussed that occasionally establish themselves in the human host. Most of the information presented con- cerns the biological aspects of the parasites. The morphology and life history of the various species are very adequately presented while the medical phases of the diseases produced in the hosts are considered in less detail. After a chapter on the general phenomena of animal parasitism, the species of protozoa, helminths, and arthopods of major interest to the parasitologist are discussed in the order of their systematic classification. Some consideration is given to three groups of parasites whose taxonomic positions have not been definitely determined: bartonella, toxoplasma, and spirocheata. Throughout the syllabus there are frequent refer- ences to the original literature; and at the beginning of each section, the student's attention is called to portions of comprehensive textbooks dealing with the subject to be discussed. The last few pages of the book are de- voted to lists of standard textbooks, periodicals, ab- stract journals, indexes, and important papers on para- sitology or closely related subjects. There are no figures or plates which would not be a serious disad- vantage if the student has ready access to the references cited by the author. A table of contents is included but there is no index of the subject matter. One of the practical features of the volume is the way in which it is printed and bound. Each sheet is printed on only one surface and the book has a spiral binding which facilitates the making of notes and drawings. THE ROSEATE SPOONBILL. Research Report Number 2 of the National Audubon Society. By Robert Porter Allen. National Audubon Society, New York. $2.50. 10 x 7 ; 142; 1942 (paper). This is the second of a series of research reports spon- sored by the National Audubon Society on rare and vanishing bird life. Between 1850 and 1890 the major destruction of spoonbills by man occurred in Texas and Florida, their numbers being reduced at the turn of the century to three small colonies. Since 1920, these handsome birds have recovered in Texas, but in Florida their occurrence is still sporadic. It appears that invasions from further south have been responsible for their return to the United States, although their exact source is still unknown. Intensive studies by the writer show that the species is limited in its distribution to suitable nesting and roosting areas, with adjacent shallow waters containing an abundant supply of food, mainly small fish. Man is no longer regarded as a decisive destructive agent and predators are influential only in certain localities. Observations on the mating behavior indicate that the females influence the males and that releasers are present in both sexes. A territory is defended but this area becomes progressively smaller as incubation begins. In a mixed colony of birds, the spoonbill is at the bot- tom of the peck order, although no serious rivalry is encountered. The incubation period is around 23 to 24 days, and the average clutch is 2.7 eggs per nest. Data are presented on food and feeding habits. There is a thorough discussion on plumages, the fully adult breeding plumage not being attained until 33 to 36 months. By recognizing these plumages it was ascer- tained that the Florida birds are mostly immature and hence non-breeders. No definite evidence was found to explain why the Texas colonies have been so success- ful in re-establishing themselves while the Florida birds have not bred to any appreciable extent. There is still much to be learned concerning the biological needs and the limiting factors of the species, but this study makes a timely and valuable contribu- tion. THE BED-BUG: Its Habits and Life History and How to Deal with It. Fifth Edition. British Museum (Nat- ural History) Economics Series No. 5. By A. W. McKenny-Hughes and C. G. Johnson. Trustees of the British Museum, London. 6d. 81 x 52; 20 + 1 plate; 1942 (paper). The Mediterranean seaboard seems most likely to have been the primary center of distribution of the bed-bug. In England bed-bugs apparently were first found in the ports, early in the 16th century. Now-a-days bed-bugs are not only found in all ports throughout the world but they are widely distributed in all countries. In England war conditions-large groups of people flocking to air-raid shelters, and large scale evacuations of the population-have resulted in a much wider distribution of this pest in all parts of the country than was formerly the case. This little pamphlet has been prepared for the layman</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 279 and gives brief descriptions of the species of bed-bug occurring in Great Britain, distribution, sucking ap- paratus, life-history, habits and biology, dissemination, where to look for bed-bugs, and bed-bugs and disease. While the bed-bug is not the carrier of disease such as influenza, scarlet fever, measles, and the like, the authors state that in infested areas it is often possible to pick out children from buggy homes by their pasty faces, listless appear- ance and general lack of energy. It can be argued that the house in which bugs are tolerated will also be the home of malnutrition, dirt and other causes of physical infirmity. Such causes cannot be held solely re- sponsible, and sleepless nights with constant irritation due to the injection of the minute doses of Bed-Bug saliva into the blood are likely to contribute largely to the ill health of children and even of certain adults. Considerable space is devoted to the control of the bed-bug, especially by fumigation. The illustrations, including one colored plate, have been well chosen and carefully executed. LARVAE oF DECAPOD CRUSTACEA. Volume I (No. 129 of the Series) Issued to Subscribers of the Ray Society for the Year 1941. By Robert Gurney. Ray Society, London. 25s. 9 x 6; vi + 288; 1942 (paper). The larval forms of aquatic Crustacea have always been difficult to study and because of their variety of forms, have caused considerable confusion as to their identity. This volume presents the significant dis- coveries made in this field up to the present and thereby is an invaluable contribution to a subject beset by many complex problems. Following an historical introduction on Decapod larvae, the writer emphasizes their importance on classification. He maintains, in contradistinction to Ortmann, that the larval stages do give pertinent clues to the phylogeny of the group. For instance, it is sug- gested that the Copepoda have arisen by arrested development from a larval form having the general characters of the Decapod protozoea. Other topics discussed are dimorphism, rate of growth, locomotion, poecilogony, distribution, eggs, and egg bearing. The various anatomical regions are reviewed, especially that of the appendages. The second part of this volume is descriptive, wherein the various larval stages of all the major groups of the Decapoda are described. In the majority of cases the examples are illustrated and tables express the gill formulae and the construction of appendages in com- parative fashion. There is a bibliography and an index, the former being a supplement to a previous contribution by the same author entitled Bibliography of the Larvae of Decapod Crustacea, published by the Ray Society in 1939. GENERAL ZOOLOGY. By Tracy I. Storer. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and London. $3.75. 8' x 6; xii + 798. 1943. Storer's General Zoology is an excellent text. It com- bines a wealth of subject matter and numerous excellent figures with such a flexible plan of arrangement that it should be adaptable to almost any college course in zoology. The book is divided into two parts. The first part stresses general principles with vertebrates (man and frog) as the main examples, though inverte- brates are also considered. This part starts with a general introduction followed by a chapter on the frog as a typical animal. This is followed by chapters on Protoplasm, cells and tissues; Organs and organ sfs- tems; Reproduction and development; Heredity and genetics; Animal ecology; Distribution of animals; Organic evolution; History of zoology; and Classifica- tion and nomenclature. In the second part each phylum is discussed sepa- rately in some detail. The chordates are treated with special fullness, nine out of the twenty-two chapters in this part being devoted to this phylum. While the book is in general excellent, one criticism might be made. In some places, too much material is presented in too condensed a form. It would have been better to have omitted this material than to have put it in a form in which it would mean little or nothing to most students. There is an index and a rather complete glossary. Lists of references are given at the end of each chapter. GUIDE TO THE LITERATURE OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCES. By Roger C. Smith. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $2.00. 101 x 81; vii + 128; 1942 (paper). This manual is a volume which is difficult to classify exactly. It is the outgrowth of an outline used for many years at the Kansas State College of Agriculture in a course dealing with zoological literature and its uses, but it has been expanded sd as to become at least partially independent of other class work. The ma- terial is arranged in outline form and almost every conceivable topic related to the zoological literature, from how to pick a satisfactory thesis problem to lists of the world's largest libraries, is mentioned. Various sections deal with the mechanics of library classification, abstract journals, bibliographies of the zoological sciences, taxonomic indexes and literature, the preparation of a scientific paper, etc., etc. Quite extensive lists of biological journals with short notes on the material which they contain are included, but these are not complete and unfortunately do not i4clude journals published in the Soviet Union, about which American biologists in general have the least available</page><page sequence="13">280 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY inforination. In most of the sections the examples given are chosen from the fields of entomology and taxonomy and other fields appear to be much less com- pletely considered. The main value of this volume will undoubtedly be as a classroom aid in courses dealing with this subject. It contains a tremendous amount of varied information, but its form of presentation and lack of completeness in most fields will make it less desirable as a reference work. ITE RING-NECK SNAKES, GENUS DiADopms. Bulletin of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, Volume 7, No. 1. By Frank Nelson Blanchard. Chicago Academy of Sciences, Chicago. $1.25. 9- x 6;; 144; 1942 (paper). This monumental work was compiled by the late Professor Blanchard over a period of 20 years, but since it had been completed only as far as the manuscript stage at the time of his death in 1937, the editing and publishing was left to a former student, H. K. Gloyd. The latter has done a superb job of presenting the material in accordance with the plan of the original author, and with a minimum of editorial changes and interpolations. Data have been presented covering the description, habitat, distribution, variations and affinities of four different species and 14 subspecies of ring-neck snakes of the genus Diadophis. Both field and museum specimens have been used for studying the variations in size and color of body, the number of teeth, the number and arrangement of scales in distinguishing species, subspecies and geographic varieties. Each subspecies is introduced with a short bibliography on taxonomy. The monograph is concluded with a general bibliography of some 150 titles, and a short index. A helpful chart indicating probable species relationships is included. IHE CRAYFISHES OF FLORIDA. University of Florida Publication; Biological Science Series, Volume III, No. 2. By Horton H. Hobbs, Jr. University of Florida, Tallahassee. $2.25. 10 x 7; 179 + 24 plates; 1942 (paper). Ten years of intensive field observation, collection, and museum study have gone into this extensive report on the crayfishes of Florida. The discussions relating to the 42 species of crayfish native to Florida, are con- cerned not only with taxonomy, but with methods of collecting, preserving, and studying crayfishes, the ecology of the form, the distribution, migration and possible evolutionary trends in the development of present day species. The author concurs with numerous other investiga- tors in taxonomy, in pointing out that certain regions of Florida are unique in their fauna and flora. The Apalachicola River valley in Liberty and Gadsden counties, for instance, represents the southernmost limits of distribution of numerous plants and animals of the Appalachian and Piedmont regions, and many organisms of that river valley, including the crayfishes, show closer affinities to northern forms than to the native Florida stocks. The report is well documented and indexed, and carries some 25 plates illustrating characteristic sex and species differences in anatomy. FIsHEs OF THIE PHOENIX AND SAMOAN ISLANDS COL LECTED IN 1939 DURING THE EXPEDITION OF THIE U. S. S. "BuSHNELL". Smithsonian Institution, United Staf-oz National Museum Bulletin 180. By Leonard P. Schultz. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C. 65 cents. 9' x 57; x + 316; 1942 (paper). The author of this report was signed aboard the U.S.S. Bushnell as naturalist during the 1939 Navy Surveying Expedition in the Phoenix and Samoan Islands, and he had the opportunity to spend 16 weeks collecting and preserving representative fauna (especially fishes) of that region. The collection of fishes herein described represents the largest single ichthyological contribution to the National Museum since 1902, and includes some 14,000 specimens representing 30 new species and sub- species and 6 new genera distributed among 18 families. The discussion of each new species includes a detailed description of the form, the distribution insofar as it is known, and the affinities to previously described forms. From the abundance of new forms represented in the present collection, the author concludes that the pisci- fauna of the South Pacific Ocean must be much more extensive than anyone now realizes. A 20-page index is provided. INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY. Second Edition. By W. J. Baerg. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $2.25. 11 x 82; 146; 1942 (paper). The first edition of this work was organized for use in the author's classes in economic entomology at the University of Arkansas, but its popularity and useful- ness spread so rapidly to other schools that a revised edition for wider distribution and use became inevitable. Data on a great variety of insect pests and related arthropods have been carefully selected, organized and illustrated for the purpose of bringing to begilnning students in a logical and condensed form, the funda- mentals of entomology as related to the welfare of man-</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 281 kind. The textual material of the volume is arranged by order and family of insect, and includes pertinent information regarding the habits and life history of each form, as well as the most successful control meas- ures, natural or otherwise. A list of references is ap- pended to the section on each insect, and a helpful index is provided. TIHE ECOLOGY OF THE ORTHOPTERA AND DERMAPTERA OF THE GEORGE RESERVE, MICHIGAN. Miscellaneous Publications, Museum of Zoology, University of Michi- gan, No. 54. By Irving J. Cantrall. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor. $1.50. 10 x 61; 182 + 10 plates + 2 maps; 1943 (paper). Intensive collecting of restricted groups within a rela- tively small, well-defined area, contributes valuable information on the ecology and life history of the animals or plants in question. The nature of this study reveals the distribution of Orthoptera (and one species of Dermaptera) within three major ecological habitats, which in turn have been subdivided into 12 minor types. As would be expected, some species are limited very locally, others are widely distributed. Graphs portray the seasonal distribution of the species, three peaks of abundance being noticeable during the year. Other notes on the breeding habits, song, and behavior are incorporated in the annotated list. THE MUSCULATURE OF THE LABRUm, LABIUM, AND PHARYNGEAL REGION OF ADULT AND IMMtATURuE COLEOPTERA. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Volume 103, No. 7. (Publication 3697). By Carl Kester Dorsey. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. 30 cents. 9% x 6x; 42 + 24 plates; 1943 (paper). The results of a comparative study of the muscle arrangement in certain regions of the insect head and stomadaeum are presented in this paper. The investi- gation was undertaken to determine the liature of the complete act of the ingestion of food by the chewing insect. The facts presented indicate, however, that the cibarial, pharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal muscles play an important part in ingestion. The action of these muscles is undoubtedly supplemented by that of the labial muscles to a varied degree depending on the species. One half of this paper is devoted to illustra- tions of the musculature as worked out. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLICATIONS IN ZOOLOGY. Vol. 46, No. 6.

To the general reader, a technical monograph such as this may well seem exceedingly dull, lacking in the glamor surrounding comets, miraculous drugs, and the sex life of primitive-peoples. Even to biologists, the greater appeal of physiology has so far overshadowed the older and more basic taxonomy that most botanists have a somewhat derogatory attitude toward this branch of their science. Perhaps for this very reason, competent monographs are now sorely needed, and few groups are more in need of adequate treatment than the aquatic Phycomycetes, especially the large and complicated group of the Chytrids. This book, there- fore, renders a great service to biology, for it is a monograph in the best sense of the term, using all possi- ble lines of evidence for attaining a better classification of these organisms, and covering the structure, develop- ment, and reproduction with commendable thorough- ness. To biologists, limnologists, botanists, algologists and mycologists, the appearance of Sparrow's book is an exciting and significant event. The preface outlines the book's purpose, to meet the need of a comprehensive monograph of the Phycomy- cetes of fresh and marine waters, a need which the mass of material rapidly accumulating since von Minden's definitive survey in 1915 has made increasingly urgent, and limits the scope by excluding the Saprolegniaceae</page><page sequence="15">282 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY and the genus Pythium, both of which have been mono- graphed fairly recently. It outlines also the plan of organization of the book, notes the difficulties in at- taining its objective of consistency in diagnoses of genera and species, and in giving precise geographic localities, and acknowledges the help of those who have aided in various ways. The introduction, in 20 pages, effectively covers certain general preliminary matters, taking up first the nature of aquatic fungi in general and more specifically the characteristics of the primarily aquatic series of the Phycomycetes. A restrained and conservative discussion of the phylogeny and relationship of these organisms follows, noting previous speculations and theories, and emphasizing the basic soundness of Scherffel's interpretation of their phylogeny and his recognition of two series, the uniflagellate Chytridineen and the biflagellate Saprolegniineen-Peronosporineen. It briefly touches also on the occurrence of the different orders in relation to substrata or hosts and to fresh or marine habitats, and shows that our present evidence indicates the group is probably ubiquitous and world- wide in distribution. Especially valuable are the four and one-half pages on methods of collection, giving in detail the procedures which the writer and other spe- cialists have found most successful, and supporting the general conclusion that the previously supposed rarity of these organisms has in reality been the result of a lack of knowledge of proper methods of collection. Equally valuable are the six pages on the methods of isolation and culture, emphasizing the techniques used by Couch, Stanier, and others in the Chytridiales, Emerson and others in the Blastocladiales, noting differences between the orders such as the Saproleg- niales, of which practically all have been cultured suc- cessfully, and the Lagenidiales, which for the most part have not yet been brought into pure culture. A brief discussion of the most useful methods of preserving and mounting material follows, and finally the orders are arranged in a key on the basis of the flagellation of the zoospores and of the characteristics of the thallus and reproduction. The detailed monographic treatment which forms the body of this volume takes up, one by one, the three orders of the Uniflagellate series and the five orders of the Biflagellate series. The Chytridiales, as is neces- sary for so notably large and diflicult an assemblage, receives the most extensive treatment-370 pages. This starts with the historic background and early work in the group, gives the basis for previous and present taxonomic treatments, and outlines the dis- tribution, occurrence, and salient characteristics of the order. The discussion of the morphology and de- velopment of the group (40 pages) is notably able, covering the thallus types and structure, non-sexual and sexual reproduction, and cytology, in a masterly presentation based on the author's own expert knowl- edge of the group, and his thorough familiarity with the difficult and voluminous literature. This general treatment ends with a discussion of parasitism, covering epidemics in nature and the conditions influencing them, and such interesting matters as host specificity and the effect of the parasite on the host cell, the mechanisms or factors controlling resistance of various algae, and hyperparasitism. The remainder of the section is devoted to the systematic account which presents first the characterization of the order, followed by a key to the families, after which each of the 7 families of the Inoperculatae and the two families of the Operculatae is taken up, characterized, and keyed to its genera, each genus being characterized and illustrated, while for each species a detailed diagnosis is given with pertinent information on its morphology, reproduction, behavior, relationship, parasitism, and other features. This sec- tion on the Chytridiales, by far the most complete and effective monograph of the order that has yet appeared, would even by itself stand as a major contribution to mycology. Similar detailed treatment is given each of the re- maining orders but these, being smaller and less complicated, naturally require somewhat less space. The 52 page discussion of the Blastocladiales is of special interest since the rapid expansion of our knowl- edge of this order in recent years and the growing appreciation of its biological significance have been exciting advances in mycology. The chapter on the Monoblepharidales, amplifying and extending Spar- row's own previous monograph of 1933, includes recent work on his remarkable and phylogenetically significant new genus, Monobleplarella. At the end of this Uniflagellate Series, the family Hypochytriaceae, of doubtful position because of its anteriorly uniflagellate zoospores, is discussed briefly, with diagnoses and pertinent information on the species of the three genera it comprises. Of the Biflagellata, the order Plasmodiophorales is covered in a chapter of 24 pages, wholly adequate for evaluating these forms in relation to others of this series, but necessarily less extensive than Karling's re- cent monograph of 144, 2-column pages which appeared almost simultaneously with the present volume. The chapter on the Saprolegniales, following the plan out- lined in the preface, limits itself to covering the Ectro- gellaceae and Thraustochytriaceae, leaving the Saprolegniaceae to the monographic treatment of Coker and of Coker and Matthews. That on the Leptomitales, here recognized as an order and separated into the two families, Leptomitaceae and Rhipidiaceae, brings up to date the work on this order since Kanouse's survey of 1927. The treatment of the order Lagenidiales is especially welcome, since in its 88 pages the author clarifies the content and position of this hitherto misinterpreted and troublesome group, separating it from the Chytridiales, with which it had been confused because of similar gross morphology, parasitism and habitat, and affording each member the adequate</page><page sequence="16">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 283 treatment it merits. Completing the survey of the Biflagellata the chapter on the Pythiaceae of the Peronosporales confines itself to the genera Zoophagus, Pythiogeton, and Pythiomorpha, since the aquatic species of Pythium itself have already been treated by Matthew and others. The list of substrata is well worth the long, dis- couraging work it must have entailed, for in 13 pages it presents the most complete and effective listing of the hosts or substrata and the aquatic fungi on them that has yet been compiled. The organization follows the taxonomic categories of substrata, beginning with plants, under which the algae are considered by classes, the species being listed alphabetically with the fungus or fungi inhabiting it following after a colon. From this organization one gains a quantitative idea of the rela- tive frequency of occurrence of these fungi on algal groups, those on the Myxophyceae, for example, oc- cupying but a quarter of a page, while those on the Chlorophyceae in general occupy two and one-half pages, on the Zygnematales over a page, and on the Desmids a page. Similarly, in the series of the Golden Algae, there are very few listings under Chrysophyceae, Cryptophyceae, and Dinophyceae, but over a page under the Bacillarieae. The Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae have relatively few, about a half page each, but these are of special interest because they are necessarily marine, and it is worthy of note that common genera with numerous species, such as Ceramium, have a large representation. The full page list on vegetable debris such as twigs, fruits, and soft tissued baits is of interest because of its variety and extent, and offers helpful hints to the collector, as do the categories of Pterido- phyte spores, pollen of Gymnosperms, and pollen and mature plants of Angiosperms. Since the fungi that serve as hosts or substrata are practically all Phycomy- cetes, as are the fungi occurring on them, this list of one and one-half pages is at first glance confusing, but readily interpreted by the punctuation. The array of animals is interesting in that it comprises representa- tives from the Protozoa, Rotifers, Nematodes, Trema- todes, Crustacea, Arachnids, Insects, and Ascidians. The bibliography, occupying 44 pages, is one of the most complete, extensive, and valuable that has ever been assembled in this field, comprising approximately 600 references, ranging in alphabetical scope of authors from Agardh to Zukal, in time from 1824 to 1941, and in sources from the well-known monographs and papers through obscure, little-known literature in less familiar languages hidden in esoteric publications. The index of 19 pages, althouigh not very extensive in the less needed references to subjects, is very com- plete and useful in its inclusion of orders, families, tribes, genera, species, and other taxonomic entities, with synonyms in italics and technical descriptions in bold face. The illustrations, after a frontispiece of four half-tone portraits of Dangeard, Zopf, Petersen, and Cornu, comprise 69 line drawings scattered through the text in appropriate places. Most of these text figures are original, either drawn by the author himself or prepared by Higgins and by Gracey for him; several are redrawn with appropriate acknowledgment, from work already published. They are a helpful supplement to the text, illustrating the significant characters of most of the genera and species, or effectively presenting life cycles, or comparisons of structural or developmental features within orders or other taxonomic groups. This reviewer feels confident that any criticisms of this book will result more from differences of opinion on the part of the reader than from just reproofs of any errors or inadequacies. It is to be noted that in these groups there has been an almost complete lack of herbarium material that could be depended upon for taxonomic comparisons, hence the taxonomic approach has been chiefly through living material, and it is the thoroughness of the writer's painstaking study of such material during the last 15 years, both in this country and in Europe, that gives this volume its authoritative soundness. The taxonomic treatment is conservative, yet it does differ in some respects from that which has been used previously or is preferred by others. Some, for example, because of the parallelism in development and thallus structure, will question the writer's de- limitation within the Chytridiales of the two parallel series, the Operculatae and the Inoperculatae, but as this characteristic is morphologically so clear cut, it serves as a valuable distinction here, as it has in the case of the Discomycetous Ascomycetes. Others, emphasizing the growth of organisms in pure culture as essential, will deplore the fact that practically all the critieria of distinction used in this book are based on the material living under approximately natural condi- tions, yet as collection under natural conditions always comes first and pure culture follows later, and as some groups have never yet been grown in artificial culture and probably will not be for some time, Sparrow's ap- proach seems the natural and more widely serviceable one. The book is notably free from typographical or other errors, the only one striking the eye of this re- viewer during careful reading being the astonishing instance of color-blindness in listing Codium among the Red Algae. The book is a notable achievement. The University of Michigan Press should be complimented both on the excellent'job they have done on the book itself and on their prodigality in making available in these times 785 pages of illustrated, technical, scientific material for $5.00. The author is to be complimented on by far the most authoritative, scholarly, and complete treatment of the aquatic fungi that has ever appeared. It is a monograph in the highest sense of the word, one that would have won the approbation of the great from deBary to Thaxter.</page><page sequence="17">284 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY TiE CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. By Francis Ernest Lloyd. Chronica Botanica Com- pany, Waltham, Mass.; G. E. Stechert and Co., New York. $6.00. 10-x65;xv+ 270 +38 plates; 1942. So axiomatic and generally accepted is the fundamental concept that all animals are directly or indirectly de- pendent upon plants for food, that the very reversal of this lends a peculiar fascination to carnivory in plants. Not only laymen and amateurs, but also outstanding scientists such as Darwin, Goebel, and many others have felt this fascination and much scattered work has been done in the field. It is, therefore, the more com- mendable and welcome that finally Lloyd has com- pleted this comprehensive, authoritative, and detailed study of the carnivorous plants. Any such study which traces a function or an activity through the diverse plants possessing it is bound to have a significant influence on science, and this authoritative volume without doubt will prove to be an epoch-making one. Comprising in large part the author's own original work, yet with a masterly synthesis of all the pertinent work previously done by others, the book has a through- ness and completeness that stamp it as outstanding. All possible aspects of the plants concerned-their taxonomy, anatomy, physiology, ecology, and relation- ship-are considered in detail, with authoritative knowledge derived from the writer's 13 years of en- thusiastic devotion to this field, devotion that involved careful absorption of an extensive literature in several languages, and first hand study of living material on this continent, in Europe, and in more remote localities during two journeys-one to Africa, another to Africa and Australia-supplemented by extensive correspond- ence, by securing the cooperation of collectors and naturalists in favorable localities, and by periods of study at various botanic gardens and laboratories. In his ingenious and decisive experimental work the writer, in addition to the more classic methods previ- ously employed, made effective use of motion pictures and time-lapse sequences-methods peculiarly suited to the problems involved. The introduction furnishes the general background essential to the detailed chapters which follow. First it lists and tabulates, with their geographic distribution, the carnivorous plants, which comprise about 450 species, of which Utricularia alone includes more than half (275); Nepenthes, 65; and Drosera, 90; represented in 15 genera belonging to 6 families, 5 of which are in the Choripetalae while the largest one, the Lentib- ulariaceae, is in the Sympetalae. The wide dis- tribution is notable, most of the genera having a wide range, large genera such as Utricularia and Drosera being ubiquitous, a few being more limited, such as Cephalotus, extreme southwest Australia; Byblis, from northwest to southwest Australia; and Dionaea, in North and South Carolina of the United States. The fundamental character of the traps is next considered, and they are arranged in order of complexity from the pitfalls or passive traps of the pitcher plants through the passive lobster pot trap of Genlisea up through the bird lime or fly-paper traps, passive in Drosopkyllum and active in Drosera, to the active steel-bear-trap-like snap-traps of Dionaea and Aldrovanda to finally the complicated mousetraps of Utricularia and its relatives, Biovularia and Polypomplzolyx. This separation into categories on the basis of function or activity, interest- ingly enough, does not agree with the botanical classifi- cation, the Lentibulariaceae having the passive lobster pot trap of Genlisea, the active fly-paper trap of Pinguicula, as well as the complicated mousetrap of Utricularia. It brings out also the interesting fact that the greatest specialization has been reached by Dionaea and Aldrovanda of the Droseraceae with their active mechanisms analagous to a steel bear trap and by Utricularia in the Lentibulariaceae with its super- mousetrap with its hair trigger operated door and in- rushing suction. Secondary to the form and action of the traps are other characters contributive to their efficiency, such as methods of attracting prey by lures- odors in some, the secretion of nectar by glands either on the traps or leading to them in others, the exhibition of attractive colors and bright fenestrations in others, the gleaming of brilliant reflections from drops of mucilage in still others. Provisions for digesting the captured prey by means of secreted enzymes and acids are present in all but a few, and the conclusion seems obvious that, from the standpoint of nutritional physiology, the advantage of this remarkable speciali- zation to the plant is the acquisition of nutrient sub- stances containing protein, possibly vitamins, and per- haps salts of potassium, phosphorus, etc. Then follows an interesting discussion of the question whether carnivory distinguishes these plants as some- thing unique in the plant kingdom or whether there are significant similarities and counterparts among non- carnivorous plants. The writer notes the rather wide- spread occurrence of pitchers without carnivory either for attracting insects to accomplish pollination as in Aristolochia, or for holding nectar as in Aquilegia, or for harboring adventitious roots and sheltering ants as in Dischidia, or as reservoirs for reserve stuffs as in Lathraea, or for water reserves as in certain leafy liverworts. He then contrasts with true carnivory the situation in plants which have adhesive glands super- ficially resembling those of Drosera-plants such as the South African Roridula which offers so complete an analog that it was generally considered carnivorous until Lloyd himself demonstrated that it was not; or plants which have some spring mechanism, fike the paleae of the grass Molinia that catches insects for- tuitously with no advantage to itself. His justifiable conclusion is that there is nothing unique about any one feature of the carnivorous plants, rather "it is the constellation of their characters which stands out." Finally he discusses the constellation of characters which mark Utricularia as the most complicated, extra-</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 285 ordinary and interesting of all, with brief remarks on the possible evolutionary interpretation of carnivory. The body of the book consists of 14 chapters consid- ering the genera from Heliamphora through Utricularia in order of the increasing complexity of their trap mechanisms, each chapter taking up the taxonomy, history, structure, development, relationship, and char- acteristics of the plants considered, with of course special emphasis on the structure, physiology, and activity of the mechanisms by which they function as carnivorous plants. In these chapters the previous work of others is synthesized and presented, together with the original observations of the author. Indicative of the thoroughness and completeness of the volume is the inclusion of chapter 11 on the carniv- orous fungi, which, since their traps are either passive adhesive dis!cs, or nooses both passive and active, fall in complexity between the passive lobster pot trap of Genlisea and the passive fly-paper traps of Byblis and Drosophyllum, yet are so remarkable in their beautiful adaptation for the capture and utilization of protozoa, nematodes, rotifers, etc., that they constitute a special field in themselves. This field, although known since the time of the pioneer work of Zopf in 1888, had been explored only fragmentarily by mycologists until the recent intensive work of Drechsler. For assembling and summarizing here this work on carnivorous fungi the author merits the admiration and gratitude of all with special citation for his intrepid and excellent review of the work of Drechsler, whose method of writ- ing is so involved and complicated that only one like Lloyd, with preliminary experience in solving the involved and complicated mechanism of Utricularia, would attempt to clarify and present the material for the ordinary botanical reader. Especially noteworthy is chapter 13 on Utricularia, Biovularia, and Polypompholyx, and the final chapter on the marvelously intricate trap itself. These alone would mark the volume as an outstanding contribution to biology. The final chapter does, indeed, support the author's contention that the trap of Utricularia is the most complicated of all carnivorous mechanisms. In matter of fact, it is so complicated one regrets that Lloyd did not schematize, diagram, and briefly schedule the complicated, beautifully timed sequence of events, for even after carefully rereading these 33 pages, the reader becomes so overwhelmed with details that it seems safe to wager that of all who review this book few if any, and certainly not this reviewer, would be able to give a completely satisfactory explanation of just how the trap really works! Lightened by the touch, which those of us who have been fortunate enough to hear Lloyd lecture on this subject realize is characteristic of him, is the appendix with its model and description of two mousetraps, the earlier one, save for the typical Lloydian touch of the Au Fromage sign post, embodying the erroneously simple concepts of Cohn and Darwin, the second em- bodying the more recent interpretation which began with the experiments of the Swiss entomologist, Bro- cher, in 1911 and gradually progressed through added bits of evidence until Lloyd's own investigations finally yielded the complete explanation. Labelling this happy nightmare "with apologies to Heath Robinson" is another delightful Lloydian touch, lost perhaps on the American reader unless he realizes that in the field of goofy gadgets Heath Robinson is the British equivalent of our own Rube Goldberg. The references are assembled after each chapter rather than in one list of Literature Cited. This, of course, leads to some repetition, Charles Darwin's Insectivorous Plants, for example, occurring in practic- ally every bibliography, but it makes each chapter com- plete in itself, and in its entirety the book is very fully documented, all pertinent references being included. The illustrations are effective supplements to the text. The frontispiece, a line cut of Nepenthes from Rumphius' Herbarium Amboinense, is of historic in- terest as the earliest known illustration of a carnivorous plant, while a charming sketch of a pitcher plant ends the book and graces the table of contents, and another of the sundew precedes the plates. Eleven line cuts serve as text figures, helpfully illustrating the text, from the first figure on the structure of the traps in Heli- amphora, through those of structural details of other genera, to successive diagrams of the sucking in of prey by Utricularia and the two final mousetraps of the ap- pendix, the Darwin Model T and the Lloyd De Luxe Model V-8. The 38 plates are in part clear-cut line drawings of structural details and in part half-tone reproductions from photographs or from the motion pictures themselves and from diagrammatic animation sequences. The line cuts are exceedingly clear and helpful, the photographs excellent, although some un- fortunately have been considerably reduced and crowded together for economy so that their details are discerned with difficulty. At the end of the book a two-page index of plant and animal names and an author index of two and one-half pages ably supplement each other in enabling the reader to locate readily the wealth of material and the numer- ous workers included in the book, while at the very be- ginning of the book a brief but informative biographical sketch introduces the writer. The volume conforms to the high standards of the Chronica Botanica Series, of which it is the ninth. The paper is of high quality, as is the typography, and there is a notable freedom from typographical or other errors, so that, as befits its noteworthy content, the volume is a beautiful job of craftsmanship. THE PLANT Co1nruNiTrSs OF THE WELAKA AREA weth Special Reference to Correlations between Soils and</page><page sequence="19">286 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Vegetational Succession. University of Florida Publica- tion: Biological Science Series, Volume IV, No. 1. By Albert Middleton Laessle. University of Florida. Tallahassee. $1.50. 10 x 7; 115 + 14 plates; 1942 (paper). This is a detailed and thorough ecological study of the University of Florida Conservation Reserve, a 2180 acre tract leased to the University by the Federal Govemment in 1939, and situated south of the village of Welaka in Putnam County. This tract, part of the Pamlico Terrace, lies along the Saint John's River in the low, relatively flat, coastal lowlands ranging from the flatwoods with elevations about 12 to 25 feet above sea level down to the bays with their marsh to submersed aquatic communities along the river. The study is based on over two years of field work, beginning in September, 1939, and may be roughly divided into three phases-first, the assembling and accurate de- termination of a herbarium comprising the vascular plants of the Reserve, about 750 species, with their ecological and seasonal variations; second, a careful soil survey with borings, studies of the macro and micro elements, and the preparation of a detailed soil map; and third, a study of the nature of the local plant com- munities and associations and their successional rela- tionships, correlating these as far as possible with the character of the soil. After a brief introduction outlining the scope and objectives of the work, the basic background is laid down in four chapters: a brief summary of the history of the Welaka area from the early visits of Bartram to the present; a brief discussion of the geology and of the Pleistocene subsidence and emergence responsible for the Sunderland and Pamlico Terraces and the present topography of the region; a short summary of the phytogeography and the floral differences in this region from that of the west side of the ridge; and finally a more detailed chapter on the climate, discussing the pre- cipitation, with pertinent data on rainfall, temperature, with tabulations qf the growing period and of the killing frosts, and also subsidiary ecological factors such as wind, lightning and fires, humidity, light, and drainage. The main body of the work begins with a detailed, intensive study of the soils of the tract, presenting analyses of their macro and micro elements, discussing the results of the author's survey, with descriptions of the eight main types of soils found in the area, and in a detailed soil map graphically presenting the extent and location of these types. The next chapter considers in detail the vegetation of the region and the vegetational associations ("association" as used here indicating a fundamental unit of vegetation in the sense of the Brussels Congress) with diagrams and analyses of square meter quadrats in areas typical of the recognized com- munities. Also, the vegetational changes from one asso- ciation to another are illustrated by bisects, some drawn to scale to show both the changes in species from one community to another and also the approximate height and layer relationships of the vegetation; others showing changes in the soil profile from one association to another, with lists of the plants characteristic at various points. A thorough study of the ecological distribu- tion of plants in the Reserve is presented in the next chapter which, after brief explanation of the method of recording and evaluating the degree of dominance or non-dominance, devotes 28 pages to careful tabulation of the distribution and relative frequency of 750 species of vascular plants in 24 natural, semi-natural, or distinctly modified habitats. Finally, the chaptet on succession gives strong evidence for interpreting the observed sequences of plant succession by correlating vegetational changes with soil development according to the concepts of Braun-Blanquet, discusses the in- fluence of fire-climax vegetation on the hard pan or ground water podzols, and presents evidence for the author's conclusions as to the influence of soil, vegeta- tion, and moisture on the invasion of one type of vegetation by another. After a brief summary 39 pertinent references are given, followed by an index in which the plant associa- tions and the soil types are in bold face, the technical taxonomic names in italics, and the remaining items in ordinary type. The illustrative material effectively supports the text. The three tables of the killing frosts and growing season, the macro elements of the soils, and of the trees per acre in a typical pine stand, although compiled from other sources, are pertinent and helpful. Two charts, one of the average monthly precipitation at the nearest weather station, Crescent City twelve miles to the east, the other of the mean daily evaporation rates (from Rogers' study of the Florida Crane-flies), give funda- mental and pertinent information. There are three maps, one on the general topography of Florida (from Cooke); the other two-the detailed soil map and the map of vegetation types-are by the author and of the highest excellence of draughtsmanship. The 25 figures helpfully illustrate the text. Nine- teen of these are diagrams of quadrat plots; while three are of soil bisects, one diagrammatic, the other two, figures 15 and 16, detailed and effective three fold bisects of a pond border with little versus much fluc- tuation; and three are vegetational transects, one from swamp of pine, another of a soil profile with accom- panying vegetation, and another of stages of plant suc- cession. The 14 plates comprising two figures each in fine screen half-tone are all from the author's photo- graphs, and uniformly good, with the possible exception of one or two (cf. Pl. 7) that are lacking in contrast; they show the types of vegetation very adequately and effec- tively. A few typographical errors, chiefly for some reason i's or lack of i's (e.g. Sporobolis, visable, Salvina, diciduous, etc.) and a few errors such as "the present elevation of the Reserve flatwoods are" seem to indi-</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 287 cate a lack of proofreading. If the aeroplane photo- graphs used by the author were indeed so valuable in his mapping of the soils in the plant communities, it seems unfortunate that some of these were not included, unless perhaps war conditions preclude their use. The writer's statement that "The aeroplane photographs were so good that one could check his position in the field on them to the width of a line" is slightly confusing, leaving the reader wondering just how wide is a line; while to the northern ecologist inured to more rigorous winters the fact that there was no first killing frost in 1920, 1922, and 1923 leaves him somewhat confused until he realizes that the last killing frost was probably at the same time the first. This able contribution fully maintains the high standards set by previous publications in this series, and both the author and the University are to be congratu- lated for what they have done toward advancing the scientific knowledge of their state. COMMON EDIBLE MusHRooMs. By Clyde M. Christensen. University of Minnosota Press, Minneapolis. $2.50. 8' x 5; x + 124; 1943. Wild mushrooms can be found in almost any locality during much of the year and yet very few people utilize them for food and those who do eat them often depend upon a few so-called tests to determine which forms are edible. None of these "tests" applies to all cases and all of them tend to exclude many forms which are perfectly edible. The only safe way to utilize these wild fungi is to know which species are edible and then learn to identify these forms with certainty. This little book is intended to provide the informa- tion necessary for this procedure for those who are completely unacquainted with the subject. It is written in non-technical language and contains photo- graphs of practically all of the forms discussed. The numerous pictures and the few easily recognized char- acteristics discussed for each form make identification a relatively simple process even for the beginner. The author also calls particular attention to those forms which may be confused with poisonous species. Forty- seven of the more common and easily recognized edible forms are discussed as well as a number of common poisonous varieties. The forms are divided into groups according to their spore color, but beyond this there has been little effort to arrange them in the form of a key, a fact which is probably not a serious handicap in a book dealing with only a few species. There are also short sections on finding and gathering mushrooms and on mushroom cookery. Although the author's statement that it is best "to learn a few species well and avoid all others" undoubt- edly represents sound advice, many readers of this book will soon find their interest extending beyond the limited number of forms discussed here. Some may also be bothered by the author's attempts at humor or human interest angles, but on the whole the book should prove of interest and value to many people who are not now acquainted with edible wild mushrooms. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGY. Second Edition. By A. J. Salle. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and London. $4.00; 9 x 6; 'xii + 643; 1943. The first edition of this excellent text appeared in 1939. The present, second, edition has been thoroughly re- vised, to embody all the advances in bacteriology which have taken place since the first edition was issued, and has been completely rewritten. As in the first edition considerable emphasis is placed on a sound knowledge of organic and inorganic chemistry. The most funda- mental change, and one which many teachers of the subject will welcome, due to the fact that those with long teaching experience usually prefer their own laboratory guides, is the separation of the laboratory procedures from the text material. The chapters which show significant reorganization are as follows: The morphology of bacteria; The micro- scope; The effect of environment upon bacteria; The nutrition of bacteria; The enzymes of bacteria; The respiration of bacteria; The fermentation of carbohy- drates and related compounds; Associations of bacteria; Differentiation and classification of bacteria; Bacterio- logy of air; Bacteriology of soil; Bacterial and virus diseases of plants; and Specific infections. A list of references is given for each chapter, and the volume is abundantly illustrated and well indexed. The final chapter (Chapter XXVII) gives a brief his- tory of bacteriology. LABORATORY MANUAL ON FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BACTERIOLOGY. Second Edition. By A. J. Salle. McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York and London. $1.50. 9 x 6; ix + 184; 1943. This Manual, originally part of Fundamental Principles of Bacteriology, has been thoroughly revised and re- written. Emphasis, as previously, is on fundamental principles and facts. The course is arranged to cover a one-semester course of six laboratory hours per week, with enough material presented so that the instructor can make a choice, if he so desires.

The Mac- millan Company, New York. $2.50. 73 x 47 165 + 16 plates; 1942. No cellular structure has been studied so intensively during the last decades as the chromosomes. Though they are known better than any other cell constituent, none presents a greater variety of problems. Today they are the subject of a science in itself. This advance during recent years has been due to a large extent to the development of diversified methods in handling chromo- somes. A compilation of these techniques in one vol- ume is, therefore, of great importance for the student as well as the research worker. The present volume is an attempt to fill the need of a comprehensive treatise on the subject. It is unfor- tunate that it does not fully reach its goal. For be- ginners in the art of treating chromosomes the instruc- tions are mostly too short and often obscure. The advanced cytologist is disappointed by the incomplete- ness, not only in the methods described but also in the material suggested as suitable' The list of organisms for living study, for instance, is pitifully short. The chapter on X-rays is hardly understandable for the novice and offers little to the advanced student. The centrifuge is dealt with in one sentence: "Experiments have been made for various purposes by ....... Similarly we are told: "most combinations of chromo- somes and breeding work are too obvious or too elab- orate to be given here." Photography has become an important tool in the study of chromosomes. Yet, besides some short instructions on how to build a camera for the microscope, there is little in the short chapter which would help to overcome specific difficulties in photomicrography of the nucleus. The last chapter tells how to describe the results of microscopic studies. With much of it every cytologist will agree. Not a few, however, will disagree with the authors' evaluation of drawings. The careful and detailed illustrations of the early cytologists "derived little from art and con- tributed nothing to science." According to Darlington "what is needed, however, is a drawing which, i) can be reproduced cheaply, ii) will show the reader, true or false, exactly what the draughtsman thought he saw. For these purposes pen-and-ink drawing alone is suitable." Everyone who has looked for some specific information in cytological papers knows how much can be found in the painstakingly realistic drawings of early cytologists. The diagrammatic black and white il- lustrations of Darlington's followers, on the other hand, show indeed nothing more than what the investigator believed important as evidence for his hypothesis. Any other structure or phase is lost until someone else with different interests happens to work on the same type of cell again. How much information-though at the moment seemingly unessential-must get lost in this way? Despite these shortcomings and despite certain in- accuracies and statements like: "the nucleus is the chromosomes. In the nucleus the apparatus of cell- government is at rest, in the chromosomes it is in movement", the book contains much worthy informa- tion. Especially useful are the tables of chromosomes in natural groups, the chromosome calendar telling when and where to find m.aterial for study, and the composi- tions of fixatives and schedules of treatment. A series of magnificent photomicrographs, well repro- duced, demonstrate both possibilities and limitations of photography in chromosome work. Even though the book does not meet the demands of the student nor of the advanced investigator it gives a much needed sum- mary of the many techniques applied today to the study of chromosomes. THE EMBRYOLOGICAL TREATISES OF HIERONYMUS FABRIcIus oF AQuAPENDENTE. The Formation of the Egg and of the Chick [De Formatione Ovi et Pulli]. The Formed Fetus [De Formato Foetul. A Facsimile Edition, with an Introduction, a Translation, and a Commentary. By Howard B. Adelmann. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York. $12.00. 10' x 61; xxiv + 883; 1942. With notable scholarship and historical zest Adelmann has brought to life again the crochety, erratic, and brilliant Paduan anatomist, Fabricius of Aquapendente. During his professorship from 1565 to 1613 this great man not only made important contributions to em- bryology by his own investigations, but he introduced the subject to a long series of able students. The most important of these, William Harvey, frankly followed the work of his teacher in his own studies of embry- ology. It is not too much to say that by his teaching and especially by his two books Fabricius brought about the emergence of embryology as a special branch of science. In the present volume we are given facsimile repro-</page><page sequence="22">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 289 ductions of The Formed Fetus (1604) and On the Forma- tion of the Egg and of the Chick (published posthumously in 1621). These reprints are accompanied by complete English translations, in which Adelmann has succeeded in unraveling the difficult Latin of Fabricius and in making his ideas clear by copious and instructive notes. Readers who are deeply interested in the history of embryology will be grateful for the ample cross- references to the predecessors of Fabricius, especially Galen, and to the text of Harvey's De generatione ani- malium. The book is prefaced by a life of Fabricius which tells us not only the details of his somewhat stormy intellectual and professional career, but gives a vivid picture of medical education in the Padua of his day. In a long introductory essay the history of embryol- ogy before Fabricius is described in detail, and his two treatises are analyzed with regard to their content of fact and philosophy. Fabricius, like Aristotle and Galen, was chiefly anxious to explain the embryo by working out the "final cause" of each organ and part; that is to say, the end or purpose it has to serve. Structure and function are studied in the light of the supposed useful purpose. Such an approach, char- acteristic of the scholastic period, naturally produces a great deal of conjecture as to the final cause, and leads to much and often misguided teleological inquiry. Not the least of Adelmann's services to his readers is his clear explanation of his author's viewpoint. We are allowed to see and understand how the mind of the great embryologist adjusted his observations to the traditions and doctrines which inevitably guided his thinking. His clear and often astonishingly accurate descriptions of the egg and the chick, the mammalian placenta and membranes, the placental and fetal cir- culation, are well brought out. The book is handsomely made up, and the printing and binding are worthy of its important subject and of the great learning, intelligence, and labor which Adel- mann has spent in its preparation. Such a work will do much to promote an understanding of the past and respect for our great predecessors. It should be called to the attention of every graduate student and medical student interested in embryology. For professional embryologists its reading is a necessity. Hu1AN EMBRYOLOGY. By Joseph Krafka. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc. New York and London. $4.75. 9' x 68; xi + 394; 1942. The present volume is one of a new series specially prepared to meet the present day needs of undergrad- uate medical students facing a much crowded curricu- lum. These "student textbooks", according to the editor's preface, are designed to present "what the student has time to read at a price he can afford to pay" -something perhaps between a compendium and an outline (!). In his attempt to present "a short but complete ac- count of the development of man" the author in his preface tries to justify (1) omitting all reference to comparative embryology; (2) eliminating virtually all reference to causal factors in development; and' (3) the elimination of laboratory exercises. The omission of (3) is of little consequence, since few institutions follow exactly any prescribed laboratory procedure, but to leave out entirely "to save space" any mention of the present day concepts of experimental embryology, evolution, and genetics, seems poor economy, to say the least. As a whole the text is more superficial than concise. In the first 66 of the 361 pages, eight chapters dealing with the following topics (including literature references) are disposed of post-haste: General em- bryological concepts; Historical development of human embryology; The male and female reproductive tracts; Hormonal control of the genital system; Fertilization and cleavage; The youngest known human implanted ovum: Hertig-Rock No. 7699. The other 300 pages are concerned principally with organogenesis and are rather wearisome. According to the author he has "re- tained the basic data contributed by that illustrious group of investigators who wrote the individual chap- ters of Keibel and Mall." Various parts of the text, particularly the descrjptions of the early stages, have been brought up to date by including some of the newer data from the publications of the Carnegie Institution of Washington Department of Embryology. The text is illustrated with some 200 figures (pen and ink drawings) redrawn in the majority of cases from previous publications. A reference list chosen to in- clude human material is found at the close of each chapter. The volume is indexed. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY MANUAL AND STUDY GUIDE. Second Edition, Revised. By Barry Griffith King and Helen Maria Roser. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia. $2.75. 11' x 8-; xi + 253; 1943 (paper). This laboratory manual and study guide has been writ- ten for use with any of the standard texts on anatomy and physiology. The exercises are designed to help the student learn by active participation in the labora- tory and by summarizing the knowledge gained from the lectures, reading, demonstrations, laboratory experience, and other teaching methods. An attempt has been made to direct attention to normal structure and function by occasionally making the student his own experimental subject and by constantly encourag- ing him to interpret his own responses in everyday ac- tivity in terms of anatomy and physiology. The authors offer a relatively large choice of practical exer- cises, many of which have been performed in nursing classes. The selection of material, the order of pres- entation, the time devoted to any particular system</page><page sequence="23">290 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of the body, and the indications of the relative im- portance of the details studied are left entirely to the judgement and experience of the instructor. This is a feature of the manual which should be much appreci- ated by all experienced teachers, since many similar laboratory manuals are entirely too inelastic to suit the desires and requirements of the individual in- structor. The subject-matter is here presented in five inde- pendent units-the body as an integrated whole, the erect and moving body, metabolism of the body, the reproductive system, and the nervous system. No specific reference is made to a text unless a pertinent discussion of the material is difficult to find. The book is furnished with an excellent assortment of illustra- tions, charts and tables. Ample space is provided for the answering of questions. Additional questions for review are provided at the end of each unit. An ap- pendix has been included to help the instructor in assembling and purchasing physical equipment for the laboratory and to acquaint the student with techniques that are useful in laboratory experimentation-includ- ing anesthesia, electrical stimulation, and kymograph recording. The manual will be found useful, not only for nursing schools, but for general college anatomy and physiology courses as well. PALMAAR AND PLANTAR DERMATOGLYPHICS IN PRI- MATES. The American Anatomical Memoirs, Number 20. By Charles Midlo and Harold Cummins. The Wistar Ittstitute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia. $3.00. 10 x 6Q; 198; 1942. The significance of dermatoglyphics in the taxonomy of primates has long been recognized, but the literature has consistently shown a scarcity of materials observed. The number of palms and soles observed for the present study, including many original living and preserved members as well as many illustrations from the litera- ture, exceeds by far that of any previous study. The result is a comprehensive work on the comparative anal- ysis of the origin, evolution, variations and affinities of the dermatoglyphics of the primates. The data are ample for a quantitative study not only of the form and intensity of the configurational palmar and plantar patterns, but of the variations and asym- metries as well. Several of the authors' conclusions are worthy of astute consideration. One such conclu- sion is that the appearance of specific dermatoglyphic patterns has been the result rather than a cause of the evolutionary development among the primates. An- other is that on the basis of the present study of inten- sities and asymmetries among the various dermato- glyphic patterns of the primates, in which man has been shown to be more primitive than orang, ". . . it is con- cluded that man stemmed from an ancestral stock more primitive than any recent ape, having dermatoglyphic traits more closely allied to those of monkeys." The work is well illustrated and documented and presents a wealth of tabular material. A table of con- tents is included, but no index is provided. THE ANATOMy OF THE NERvous SYsTEmfrom the Stand- point of Development and Funtction. Seventh Edition, Revised. By Stephen Walter Ranson. W. B. Saunders Com- pany, Philadelphia. $6.50. 9' x 6Q; xii + 520; 1943. The first edition of this book appeared in 1920. From its beginning it has been noted for its excellence of presentation and for the skillful manner in which it correlates form and function. The present edition, which was completed just prior to the untimely death of the author, maintains this high standard. The pace of neurological research has been so swift that, although the previous edition was published as recently as 1939, it has been found necessary to make rather extensive additions and alterations. That this has been accomplished without undue lengthening of the text is a tribute to the author. The many new illustrations, however, are a welcome addition. Presentation of the subject matter has been slightly changed. The chapters dealing with cerebellum, dien- cephalon, cerebral cortex, and autonomic system have been revised and rewritten. That on the diencephalon has undergone special revision so as to include the re- sults of recent investigations, and is notably improved. A new chapter, dealing with the meninges and blood vessels of the brain, has been added. The illustrations of the sheep brain, formerly scattered throughout the text, have been collected and placed at the end of the atlas. This book always has exerted a strong and beneficial influence on the teaching of neuroanatomy in this coun- try. There is little doubt that, in its latest edition, it remains one of the best textbooks on the subject in any language. HANDBOOK OF MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF Tis- SUES AND ORGANS. Second Edition. By Karl A. Stiles. The Blakiston Company, Phila- delphia. $1.50. 9 x 6; xi + 204; 1943 (paper). The success and popularity which this excellent little handbook has earned in the past two years well merits the present revision. The new materials and the few changes incorporated in the present edition have re- sulted in an improved supplementary text and work- book for the student of histology. The first few chapters of the textual material deal</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 291 with the various types of tissue cells. The balance of the volume is devoted to the histology of the various organ systems of the body. The materials are pre- sented in outline summary form, supplemented fre- quently with tabular charts. Blank pages are provided for lecture notes, drawings, references, or any other comments pertinent to the subject under discussion. The volume is attractively bound and carries a glossary and an index. The present edition of this fine work will undoubtedly meet further success in its field, since it will certainly enhance the study of his- tology in the present accelerated program of study in the fields of biology and medicine. LABORATORY DREcTIONS FOR IHSTOLOGICAL TEcH- NIQUE. By Alfred Brauer. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $1.25. 11 x 81; 43; $1.25 (paper). This manual contains surprisingly complete and up-to- date directions for a one-semester college course in histology. Since the outline is prepared essentially for students of zoology, physiology, bacteriology, pre- medical students, and those preparing for careers in medical technology, methods in entomological and parasitological techniques have been held to a mini- mum and histological technique has been emphasized. Subject-matter presented is the following: material supplies and equipment, general outline of procedure for processing tissues, fixing, washing, dehydration, clearing, infiltrating, imbedding, sectioning, affixing sections on slides, cleaning slides, staining and mount- ing, some biological stains, clearing agents, whole mounts, smear techniques, special techniques (including bone, connective tissue, nervous tissue, embryos, he- patic glycogen, and mitochondrial techniques), and the nicrotome knife. There is a very helpful chart pro- vided which includes and gives directions for each of the steps involved from the beginning fixing process- using seven different fixing agents-to the final act of covering the material on the microscope slide. The manual'contains a brief list of available reference books on the subject and concludes with an index. AN OUTLINE MAuAL FOR TIEH STUDY OF HiSTOLOGY. By Arthur J. Gatz. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $1.75. 104 x 84; 80; 1941 (paper). This laboratory manual provides outline descriptions of the tissue systems, sufficient material being given to enable the student to identify the components by him- self in the majority of cases. Every other page has been left blank for student notes or drawings. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY CONSTITUTION AND DISEASE: Applied Constitutional Pathology. By Julius Bauer. Grune and Stratton, New York. $3.50. 84 x 54; ix + 208; 1942. The author of this most welcome and stimulating book is a former professor of medicine in Vienna and an out- standing authority on constitutional problems. In his preface he describes constitution as follows: It is taken for granted ... that the potential energy of the germ plasm accounts for the development of a full-fledged human being out of a fertilized ovum of microscopic proportion in the short period of nine months. It is not adequately realized, however, that this potential energy is at work throughout a whole lifetime; that the physiologic evolution and involution, the structure and function of the organs, their mutual relation, and the response to various stimuli depend on this potential energy; that deficiencies and abnor- malities of this potential energy may be cooperative etiologic factors or the sole cause of diseases; that they account for the vast majority of congenital malforma- tions in man. And this potential energy is just what we might call individual constitution. This concept excludes strictly all environmentally in- duced characteristics of an individual as part of his constitution. At a later place the author comments as follows regarding the relation between constitution and race: What was originally a constitutional trait and became a familial one by hereditary transmission, may even- tually become a racial characteristic by natural or sexual selection. As a matter of fact, it is the accumu- lation of such a constitutional trait in the population that justifies the term racial characteristic. A large part of this volume deals systematically with the constitutional inferiority of organs and tissues. Another part discusses the integrative systems of indi- vidual constitution on the basis of what the author has termed the "principle of treble safeguard". The latter recognizes and stresses the fact that most functions of an organism are dependent upon, and regulated by, the proper interaction of a particular organ with the endo- crine system as well as the nervous system. Individual differences in the symptomatology of various diseases can often be explained on the basis of abnormalities in one or another of these three regulating and cooperating factors. There follows a chapter devoted to the classi- fication of normal and abnormal constitution, starting with the blunt assertion that "there are as many differ- ent constitutions as individuals." The last major chapter is chiefly of clinical interest inasmuch as it is concerned with diseases which have mainly a constitu- tional etiology, such as diabetes, obesity, various blood diseases, peptic ulcer and cancer. Much of this dis- cussion reaches into the domain of medical genetics.</page><page sequence="25">292 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY This scholarly and original work closes with the fol- lowing warning: It must be kept in mind that although endowed with the most perfect and valuable endocrine preparations, we are not able to adjust their administration to the requirement of the body as precisely as the production and liberation of hormones is adjusted to the require- ment in the normal body. It is beyond our power to imitate exactly the nervous factors that regulate the discontinuous production and output of hormones under normal conditions. We should be modest and more reluctant to interfere with the precise mechanism of the living machine without necessity. There is an extensive bibliography, but no index. VIRUS DISEASES. The 1942 Messenger Lectures on the Evolution of Civilization. By Members of The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research: Thomas M. Rivers, Wendell M. Stanley, Louis 0. Kunkel, Richard E. Shope, Frank L. Hors- fall, and Peyton Rous. Cornell University Press, Ithaca. $2.00. 94 x 6; viii + 170; 1943. Virus diseases are not new, but the recognition of them as a group of maladies different in certain respects from those caused by protozoa, fungi, spirochetes, and bac- teria has taken place in the last fifty years. Thus, when used in connection with certain maladies, the term virus no longer has a general or indefinite meaning, but has acquired a definite significance similar to that carried by the word bacterium, bacillus, or spirochete. It has been necessary to develop special methods of investigating the phenomena of infection and resistance in the differ- ent fields of biology, and consequently one should not be surprised to find that many new techniques have been used in the study of viruses and the diseases caused by them. Even though the general principles of other infections apply to virus maladies, the causative agents of the latter have been found suffciently different from those of the former to upset some old and accepted ideas. The six sections of the present volume deal with the following subjects: virus diseases with particular refer- ence to vaccinia; chemical structure and the mutation of viruses; new hosts as a key to progress in plant virus disease research; swine influenza; human influenza; and viruses and tumors. It is emphasized that many new virus diseases have been discovered in recent years and that, although virus workers are not always in agreement and the same virus worker not infrequently changes his ideas, many facts about these peculiar agents have been established and are sufficiently important and interesting to warrant their being brought together under one cover. In the present series of Messenger Lectures, virus workers of recognized authority have attempted to do this for the fields with which they are familiar. Bibliographies are given at the end of each contributor's article. There is no index. The volume makes a significant contribution to the field of virus literature and should prove helpful to physicians, public health workers, immunologists, research investigators, and all other students of these interesting ultramicro- scopic forms of life. CREATINE AND CREATININE METABOLISM. By Howard H. Beard. Chemical Publishing Com- pany, Brooklyn. $4.00. 8' x 5; x + 376; 1943. Although creatine was recognized many years ago as a significant factor in muscle physiology, the subject of creatine and creatinine metabolism has remained a much disputed and imperfectly understood field. The literature on this subject has become very extensive, but much of the work is conflicting and inconclusive for one reason or another. It is against this back- ground that Beard has attempted to summarize our present knowledge in this field. The book covers practically every subject to which creatine and creatinine metabolism can be related. Various chapters deal with methods of determination, distribution in the animal body, various steps in the formation of creatine and creatinine, relation to water metabolism, excretion, various phases of muscle metab- olism, tumor growth and regression, and many other subjects. In many of these sections the author has extended his discussions beyond the immediate field of creatine and creatinine metabolism into such topics as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, muscular contraction, phosphate bond energies, etc. The sub- ject of creatine and creatinine metabolism cannot be treated in a vacuum and such an expansion is to be expected in a book of this type. However, one does not and should not expect to find these fields as com- pletely covered as the main topic. It would be a mistake to assume that recent work has cleared up all or even most of the controversial ques- tions in this field, and there will undoubtedly be many who will disagree with the point of view presented by the author on various questions. However, this should not lessen the value of the book for such workers. There is an extensive bibliography provided, many of the techniques employed are discussed in some detail, and the whole is provided with both subject and author indexes. It therefore represents an ideal starting point for anyone interested in investigating a particular point more thoroughly. Although the book will be most valuable to those who are actively interested in its field, the various clearly written sections should aid teachers and biol- ogists in general in clearing up many of the misconcep- tions about this subject which exist at the present time in many minds.</page><page sequence="26">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 293 FOOD POISONING. By G. M. Dack. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $2.00. 9 x 6; xi + 138; 1943. Knowledge of food poisoning has increased so rapidly during recent years that books on the subject have often become dated or have been too limited in scope to serve the many groups now concerned with food poisoning. Food superstitions, the bogey of "pto- maine poisoning," and other popular misconceptions persist among the general public. Moreover, the cur- rent revolution in American eating habits, drastic upsets in supply and distribution of food and food prod- ucts, and changes in methods of processing and pack- aging foods have heightened the need for an authorita- tive statement of our newest and best knowledge of food poisoning, compiled in readily available form. This book, written by an acknowledged authority in the field, is a heartening attempt to fill this need. It is primarily a critical discussion of the various agents which may cause food poisoning. Similarities and dis- tinctions are drawn so that the volume will be of prac- tical help to individuals engaged in studying the nu- merous gastrointestinal upsets which may or may not be due to food poisoning. As a general term, food poisoning is here limited to outbreaks of an explosive nature which are generally characterized by gastro- intestinal upsets. Among the important exceptions, however, is botulism, in which the gastrointestinal symptoms are usually a minor feature of the disease. The causative agents included in the volume are: chemicals, poisonous plants and animals, bacteria and their products, protozoa and helminths, and a mis- cellaneous group of illnesses the causes of which are unknown. Of these agents, the bacteria, which form toxins in food before ingestion, are discussed at great- est length. In addition to generous citations from the literature, which are presented in the form of footnotes, original experiments not previously reported in the literature are included. A complete index concludes the volume. Although not a textbook, the book should have particular value for all who are professionally concerned with food poisoning, for students of medi- citie, nursing, food bacteriology, and home economics, and for state and municipal public health workers. To all of these, as well as to the intelligent layman, this excellent volume is heartily recommended. THE SCIENCE OF HEALTH. By Florence L. Meredith. The Blakiston Company, Philadelphia. $2.50. 9 x 6; xi + 427; 1942. This volume is the second edition of Twelve Hours of Hygiene, the title having been changed with the change in scope and organization of the material. The stated purpose of the author remains the same; it is for use in one-hour, one-semester college courses in hygiene. The teacher familiar with the first edition will note that the chapters on anatomy, physiology and the lesions of disease have been reduced; that the introduction has been extended to give a picture of the health situation in the country today; that more space has been given to the vital matters of nutrition and physical training and to several other current health problems of per- sonal and national importance, including parenthood and the welfare of the next generation, and nervous and mental disorders; and that a new section has been included on mental hygiene. The author has made a special effort to do the fol- lowing: to give facts usable by the student in making his own decisions, to give opinions generally held by medical science, to weight the material properly, to arrange the material so that its order and sequence in itself will be educational in effect, and to use scientific terminology in so far as it will help to clarify the stu- dent's thinking. Subject matter presented includes: the body in health and disease; supply, use and re- newal of energy; thermal regulation; cleanliness; bac- terial, physical and chemical injury; major disorders of internal origin; brain and nerves; mental health; and the next generation. The appendix includes sections on: chemical composition of foods, vitamins, mortality statistics, health organizations, medical education, and medical specialists. The excellent illustrations, including charts, graphs and other tabular material, are a distinct feature of the book. An extensive bibliography and a complete in- dex conclude this well-written, well-balanced and at- tractively printed and bound volume. It is recom- mended to all students and teachers of college hygiene courses and to the general public as well. THE METABOLIC COST OF MAINTAINING A STANDING POSITION with Special Reference to Body Alignment. By Harriet Graham McCormick. King's Crown Press, New York. $1.25. 9 x 6; 75; 1942 (paper). Does "good" posture take less energy to maintain than "poor" posture? Is there, or is there not, a relation- ship between the way an individual stands and the amount of energy he uses in maintaining that position? If there is such a relationship what is the alignment of the body which is associated with minimum energy expenditure and what with maximum? These are questions which are being asked by students of ortho- pedics, body mechanics, and physical education. A number of investigations have already been made on this matter of the metabolic cost of standing and of closely related problems, but there is still little unanim- ity of opinion among authorities in the field. It was the purpose of the present study to provide more ex- perimental evidence in the hope of throwing more light on this matter. Specifically, Mrs. McCormick</page><page sequence="27">294 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY has stiidied the following problems: (1) Is there any relationship between the alignment of the body in the standing position and the variation in metabolic in- crease in the standing rate over the basal rate, and if a relationship exists, how does body alignment vary with this increase in metabolic rate? and (2) Is there any relationship between the increase in metabolic rate and the scores in a given posture test? Material discussed includes: the history and back- ground of the problem, collecting the data, results of the metabolism determinations, measuring body align- ment, the relationships with metabolic increase, and the implications of these findings. The book is illustrated with appropriate photographs, charts and tables. The appendix contains directions for marking the pho- tographs for measuring. There is an extensive bib- liography, but no index. The author's findings, here reported with clarity and precision, should interest and serve all who are concerned with the basic problem or with the related one of helping individuals to im- prove their body mechanics and posture. HumAN PHYSIOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS. By Harrison M. Tietz. Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis. $3.00. 11xM8;324;1942(paper). The aim of this book is to present physiological facts, in a fairly simple manner by avoiding long technical dis- cussions. For this reason the author has not included experimental evidence to support the various theories. There has also been omitted any reference to current articles and source material. The author feels that the average student has neither time nor inclination to use these references, and in this he is probably quite correct. The human body is considered as a complex machine and with this idea in mind the author has divided his discussions of each system into three parts: (1) a section devoted to anatomy, or the names and locations of parts; (2) normal physiology, or the natural functions of these parts; and (3) a chapter dealing with practical considerations, in which diseases, etc. of a system are discussed on the bases of a disfunction of some organ or organs. The excellent drawings, all of which are the original work of the author are exceedingly numerous, weli planned, and well executed and add materially to the value of the book from the student's point of view. The volume begins with an introductory chapter on cells, tissues, organs and systems and then proceeds to elaborate on the skeletal system and associated tissues; the muscular systems; foods, digestion and the structure of the digestive system; the structure and physiology of the blood and of the circulatory system; the lymphatics; the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory and reproductive systems; excretion; the nervous system; structure and physiology of the eye and ear; reactions and motor pathways; the cerebellum and the kinesthetic sense; autonomic nervous system; speech and language; the skin; metabolism; and the intemal secretions. Many students, particularly those in the pre-medical curriculum, will find the chapters on the practical considerations especially interesting because in these discussions they can see the applica- tion of physiological facts to health and disease. A very complete index is appended to the volume. FUNDAMENTALS OF IMMUNOLOGY. By William C. Boyd. Interscience Publishers, Inc. $5.50. 9 x 6; xiv + 446; 1943. This book, written as an introduction to immunology for medical students, chemists, and biologists, not only covers the field thoroughly for the beginner but also deals with advanced problems which will interest the professional immunologist. It is assumed by the author that the student will have had some acquaint- ance with chemistry and bacteriology when he comes, in his curriculum, to this subject. For the beginner, Boyd stresses the basic principles of immunology-the fundamental mechanisms of im- munological reactions and their theoretical foundations -on the ground that these once mastered, their appli- cation will not be fouiddifficult. The chapter headings are as follows: Immunity and immunology; Antibodies and antibody specificity; Antigens; Cell antigens; Blood groups; Antibody-antigen reactions; Complement and complement fixation; Anaphylaxis and allergy; Allergyand immunity;bacteria; viruses, parasites; Prac- tical use of artificial immunity; Laboratory and clinical technic. In the last-mentioned section (Chapter XI- the longest in the book) are given detailed descriptions of theoretical and practical serological procedures, with a sufficient number of experiments provided so that some selection can be made by the instructor for class work. The author has adopted the method of distinguishing that part of the text intended for ad- vanced workers by the use of smaller type. This seems a most satisfactory procedure, especially for those students whose interests carry them beyond the introductory course. Each chapter in the volume concludes with a list of references to recent and pertinent literature. Some of these lists are quite lengthy, in one case running to 187 titles. Tables and figures occur throughout the text and an excellent working index is provided. A text which undoubtedly will be well received by both teachers and students. TIk INFEcTIOUs DISEASES oF DoMEsTrc ANIMALS with Special Reference to Etiology, Diagnosis, and Bio- logic Therapy. By William Arthur Hagen. Comstock Publishing</page><page sequence="28">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 295 Company, Inc., Ithaca. $6.00. 94 x 68; xxvii + 665; 1943. This excellent text, based on the author's experience for many years as a teacher in the field will be widely accepted as a guide for courses in veterinary medicine. It departs from the usual method of presentation of the subject in that a knowledge of the general principles of bacteriology is taken for granted and so is omitted. This makes it possible to give space to fungi, protozoa, and viruses that are pathogenic-for the domestic ani- mals and to discuss more fully the nature of the dis- eases produced by the various agents and the biologi- cal products which are available for their diagnosis, prevention, and cure. The volume is divided into six parts. Part I (8 chapters) deals with the mechanisms of infection and resistance; Part II (19 chapters) is concerned with the pathogenic bacteria; Part III (3 chapters), with bac- teria-like pathogenic organisms of uncertain classifica- tion; Part IV (2 chapters), with the pathogenic fungi; Part V (7 chapters), with the pathogenic protozoa; and Part VI (5 chapters), with the viruses. Each chapter concludes with a list of references for further reading, the 145 figures are well chosen and their reproduction is excellent. The index is adequate, al- though in a volume containing such a wealth of material the reviewer believes that a more detailed index would be an advantage. A book that is destined to become one of the stand- ard texts in its field. It will also be valuable as a reference to the veterinary practitioner, the research worker, the laboratory technician, and the intelligent person who is so situated that at times he is obliged to depend upon his own resources in the treatment of his animals. TE[E SIGHT SAVER. By C. J. Gerling. Harvest House, New York. $2.00. 8 x 52; 202; 1943. Realizing that the average person knows little about eyes, what may go wrong with them, common defects, diseases, disorders, accidents, etc. that may affect them, the author has prepared this practical volume of general information for the layman. He feels that good, serv- iceable eyesight is generally a matter of taking ad- vantage of the many means available for the protection and correction of vision, but he makes it clear that his book is merely to acquaint one with what may be done for ailing eyes and in no sense is to be considered as information for self-treatment. "The very delicacy of the eyes that makes them need attention also de- mands that this attention be given only by the trained and experienced hands of a graduate physician or ocu- list." One valuable feature of the book is the information which is given on widely advertiged eye products such as patent medicines, lotions, washes, cosmetic aids to beauty, etc. which are either harmless mixtures or extremely harmful, often producing sight impairment, blindness or even death-in all cases ineffective for their advertized purpose. Information is also given on various widely exploited branches of eye quackery including the "sight without glasses" racket. Instead of following the customary form of chapter divisions the various subjects are arranged in alpha- betical sequence with cross references according to the general principles of the encyclopedia. Such an ar- rangement has made possible a vast amount of infor- mation within a small compass. Under the heading Books on the eyes, sight, etc. one finds a list of inex- pensive pamphlets issued by the American Medical Association, free pamphlets issued by reliable organiza- tions, and popular and technical books on vision which will be helpful to those wishing further reliable in- formation. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS BY LABORATORY METHODS. A Working Manual of Clinical Pathology. Tenth Edition, Thoroughly Revised. By James Campbell Todd and Arthur Hawley San- ford. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. $6.00. 9- x 6; x + 911; 1943. Medical technicians, doctors, teachers, and students will welcome the tenth edition of this already well- known book. The rapid improvement of old tech- niques and the discovery of new ones have justified an extensive revision. Much new material and a con- siderable number of illustrations have been added. A few of the new additions and changes may be men- tioned. There is a new arrangement of the material on rickettsial diseases, the Quick prothrombin test is de- scribed, the fluorescent dye method of staining tubercle bacilli is included, tests for sulfonamides and sulfones in the blood and methods of identifying sulfonamides and sulfones in the blood and methods of identifying sulfonamide crystals in the urine have been added, diseases due to fungi are given brief treatment and Brewer's new methods for growing anaerobic organisms are described. The chapter on clinical chemistry has been augmented by addition of the Haskins and Osgood titration method for the determination of the alkaline reserve figure and the Agren and Lagerl6f methods for the determination of trypsin and amylase. The Somogyi technique for the determination of serum amylase is likewise given. It is not worth while enumerating all of the new additions, revisions, and deletions. However, only methods which have clearly become obsolete have been omitted. Where two or more techniques are still in general use, all are included, as for example, in the sero- diagnostic tests for syphilis.</page><page sequence="29">296 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY LE PROBLUE DU CANCER. By Charles Oberling. Les Editions de l'Arbre, Mon- trhal. $1.50. 75 x 51; 298; 1942. An exposition and critical review of experimental work on the etiology, rather than treatment, of cancer forms the major portion of this book. The material was originally presented in a series of lectures given in Paris and Th6ran to medical students and physicians. With the aim of making the material available to a larger group of readers, the lectures have been revised for publication, mainly by the omission of the more technical details and the inclusion of explanations of technical terms. Chemical, genetic, bacteriological, pathological and parasitological aspects of the problem are considered. BIOCHEMISTRY PROTEINS, AMNO ACIDs AND PEPTDES AS IONS AND DIPOLAR IONS. American Chemical Society Mono- graph Series. By Edwin J. Cohn and John T. Edsall, including chapters by John G. Kirkwood, Hans Mueller, J. L. Oncley and George Scatchard. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York. $13.50. 9 x 6; xviii + 686; 1943. This volume is number 90 of the monograph series dealing with various chemical problems, sponsored by the American Chemical Society. The series has come to play an important r6le in current chemical thought and research by bringing together in single volumes and in a well-digested form the pertinent material on a given subject. The publication of these monographs has been carried out with two primary aims. In the first place, works such as this tend to stimulate and organize research in the field with which they deal by providing a well-organized and readily available sum- mary of the work to date, thus indicating new direc- tions in which research may be profitably followed. A second, and equally important, function served by such a work is in providing readily accessible information for those who are working outside of the specific field discussed by the monograph. The growing depend- ence of other fields upon various branches of chemistry and tIhe extensive interdependence of the various chemi- cal fields themselves makes this second service of ex- treme importance. The present monograph does not attempt to cover all phases of the chemistry of amino acids, peptides, and proteins, but rather limits itself to a consideration of these molecules from the standpoint of their size and shape and the number and distribution of the electrical charges which they bear. As the authors point out in the preface, they are considering above all, ". . . the implications of their charged structure for their physical properties, and their physicochemical interaction with other molecules". The basis for this field of research was provided largely by the work of Debye and Huckel on the interionic forces in electro- lyte solutions, and that of Bjerrum which showed that even at their isoelectric point aliphatic amino acids bear both positively and negatively charged groups, i.e. they are dipolar ions or Zwitterionen. Advances have been rapid in the two decades since this funda- mental work, but as one would expect, the work on proteins themselves has advanced much less rapidly than that on the simpler amino acids and peptides. Most of the work of preparing this volume was done by a small, closely-knit group of workers centered around the Harvard Medical School and the Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology. Their close associa- tion has probably contributed much to the unity with which the various phases of the subject have been pre- sented, and the fact that this may have led to some narrowness of viewpoint is offset by the abundant refer- ences to the original work on the subjects considered. These should prove adequate for any who may dis- agree with interpretations arrived at in the text. An extensive subject index and a tabular index of data on many amino acids, peptides, and proteins also adds to its value as a reference work. This is not a book which will appeal to those with only a passing interest or a scanty background in the subjects discussed, but it will undoubtedly be a valu- able addition to the reference lists of many who are actively interested in these problems. THE ANTIGONADOTROPIC FACTOR with Consideration of the Antihormone Problem. By Bernhard Zondek and Felix Sulman. Williams &amp; Wilkins Company, Baltimore. $3.00. 9 x 6; viii + 185; 1942. The organ response to various pituitary preparations is not constant but falls off in the course of protracted treatment. Systematic research on this subject showed that experimental animals respond to continuous ad- ministration of gonadotropic substances with formation of substances capable of inactivating gonadotropic hormone both in vivo and in vitro. This class of sub- stances was termed antihormones by Collip. Zondek and Sulman, working in the newly founded Hormone Research Laboratory of the Hebrew Uni- versity, Jerusalem, have made a number of valuable contributions to this field. They now present their original experimental material-much of it hitherto unpublished-with a general survey of the antihor- mone problem in the form of a monograph. In an introductory chapter the historical development of the problem is discussed and concise definitions of the terms used for the various hormones and antihormones are given. The units of dosage also are clearly defined in this chapter. The laboratory and clinical studies of</page><page sequence="30">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 297 the authors lead them to the view that the production of an antigonadotropic factor through prolonged treat- ment with gonadotropin is an immune reaction. How- ever, the antigonadotropic factor does not give the in vitro reactions which generally characterize an antibody. This concept differs from Collip's antihormone theory. Collip postulates a buffer-system of hormones and antihormones, which are normally in a state of equilib- rium in the animal body. If an animal, which pos- sesses a well-balanced hormone buffer-system is pro- tractedly treated with large amounts of a certain hormone, the corresponding "antihormone" level rises. In this way equilibrium is re-established and the blood of the animal receiving treatment contains easily de- tectable amounts of "antihormone". In Zondek's and Sulman's monograph the arguments for and against Collip's interpretation of the antihormone phenomenon are excellently presented. The chapter on the clinical significance of the anti- hormones should be read by every clinician who finds it necessary to undertake protracted therapy with gonadotropic hormones. Not only the endocrinologist, but every biologist interested in the mechanism of hormonal correlations in the animal body will find this book full of stimulating ideas. An excellent bibliog- raphy enables the reader to delve further into the scattered literature of this fascinating field. Noxious GASES and the Principles of Respiration In- fluencing Their Action. Second and Revised Edition. By Yandell Henderson and Howard W. Haggard. Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York. $3.50. 9 x 6; 294; 1943. Gases differ fundamentally from solids and liquids in their physical behavior. Accordingly, poisonous gases and vapors have characteristic effects upon men and animals exposed to them, distinct from noxious sub- stances in solid and liquid form. This book deals primarily with the special features of toxic action de- pendent upon volatility. The classification and de- scription of volatile poisons are necessarily different in some respects from those usually employed in toxicology as well as from those which chemistry would suggest. The mode of classification adopted here is practical rather than strictly logical. The literature primarily devoted to the particular topic of volatility as a factor in toxicology is small as yet, but is increasing, and it is only with the special features due to volatility and entrance through the lungs that the present authors are concerned. The references given here are therefore confined to two purposes: (1) particular points, usually on toxic concentrations, and (2) general references placed at the end of the chapters. Only those gases which occur in industry are dealt with; their use in war is not discussed. References to works dealing with chemical warfare are, however, given at the end of the chapter on irritant gases. Material presented includes: elements of respiration; the respiratory functions of the blood and their laws; practical applications of the laws of gases and vapors; principles determining absorption, distribution, and elimination of volatile substances; classification of noxious gases and vapors; irritant gases; asphyxiation and simple asphyxiants; volatile drugs and drug-like substances; methods of resuscitation and comparison of various treatments; and prevention of poisoning by noxious gases. The aim of the authors is not so much to contribute to treatment or to aid in the winning of compensation as it is to make available the knowledge, the principles, and the techniques upon which measures of prevention and of safety in industry must be based. Bibliogra- phies are appended to most of the individual chapters. A complete index is provided. The volume contains much material of practical use for chemists, engineers, physiological hygienists, and others engaged in indus- try. It deserves a wide reading by those whose work is in these fields. LABORATORY DIRECTIONS IN BIocHEmisTRY. By Victor C. Meyers. C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis. $3.50. 10' x 72; 288; 1942 (paper). This laboratory manual has been written primarily for medical and dental students who are attempting to cover as large a number of different topics in biochem- istry as possible in a limited period of time. It brings together a large number of commonly utilized experi- ments and presents them in the briefest possible form. Over half of the book is given over to the strictly clinical aspects of the subject, particularly as related to urine and blood analysis, and even the first 120 pages, which supposedly deal with biochemistry in a more general sense, definitely anticipate the clinical sections which follow. In the general section the primary emphasis is upon the detection of various substances, and quantitative tests are largely confined to the clinical section where their precision is usually considered in terms of clinical requirements rather than in terms of the characteristics of the reaction itself. This general clinical emphasis seems in many cases to prevent the adequate utilization of the experiments to demonstrate general biochemical principles, reaction mechanisms, etc. On the whole, this manual represents a compilation of a large number of experiments in much the same form as they are found in the "home-made" laboratory manuals used in many places, and presented in much the same "cook-book" fashion. These are supple- mented by a limited number of references, particularly in connection with quantitative methods. It will undoubtedly be useful to students interested in bio- chemistry as a routine clinical book, but to those who consider biochemistry as a field in itself which is capable</page><page sequence="31">298 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of throwing light on many of the fundamental problems of both physiology and organic chemistry it will appear to miss the point. Although the type of presehtation which this manual represents is widely used, its ade- quacy in providing a foundation for further work in biochemistry, or indeed for a clear understanding of the basic principles involved in biochemical reactions, may be questioned. ADVANCES IN ENZYMOLOGY and Related Subjects. Vol- ume II. Edited by F. F. Nord and C. H. Werkman. Inter- science Publishers, Inc., New York. $5.50. 9 x 6; viii + 374; 1942. This carefully-prepared, well-edited, and thoroughly documented book is an authoritative treatise on en- zymology and related subjects which represents the considered research and conclusions of fifteen recog- nized and established American, British, Swiss, Danish, and Japanese investigators. It is the second volume in a series of at least four planned works. It represents the latest word concerning the multifarious investiga- tions already completed, now underway, and contem- plated in this rather new and absorbing field of scientific interest. Two of the articles in the book are in Ger- man; the remainder are in English. Subjects discussed include: bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), the kinetics of hydrolytic enzymes and their bearing on methods for measuring enzyme activity, a classification of proteo- lytic enzymes, the enzymatic properties of peptidases, diamin-oxydase, the chemistry of tea-fermentation, heterotrophic assimilation of carbon dioxide, enzymes associated with respiration and fermentation of Asper- gillus, cellulose decomposition by micro-organisms, a unified hypothesis of the reciprocal integration of carbohydrate and fat catabolism, the chemistry and physiology of Vitamin K, and the adrenal cortical hormones. The book is attractively printed and very substantially bound. The illustrative material is well chosen and very helpful. Each section is replete with its own extensive bibliography-a total of over 1000 references being given. The volume concludes with both an author and a subject index and a cumulative index of Volumes I and II. A work which will be of general interest and considerable value to chemists, physiologists, research workers, and others who are concerned with this rapidly developing field of science. TEXTBOOK OF BIOcHEIsTRY. Third Edition, Revised. By Benjamin Harrow. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia. $4.00. 9 x 6; ix + 537; 1943. Through two previous editions this compact textbook of biochemistry has come to be one of the most widely used and recommended books in its field. It is smaller than most texts in biochemistry, but the material is well chosen and more than adequate for the needs of any elementary biochemistry course. Actually, this book has come to be relied upon by a great many biol- ogists as a dependable source of biochemical informa- tion outside of their immediate field of interest, and its value as a reference book is enhanced by the short, but well chosen, bibliographies which accompany each chapter. Review articles and references to other books are emphasized, and most of the entries are accompa- nied by a note on their particular value. The third edition has been expanded by almost one hundred pages. A new chapter on immunochemistry and chemotherapy has been added, and many sections have been revised and expanded, including those on various phases of intermediary metabolism, hormones, viruses, sulfhydryl groups and their significance, detoxi- cation, etc. There are also timely discussions of wartime problems dealing with nutrition, blood plasma, etc. This book is comprehensive in scope and remarkably up-to-date for a textbook of its type. The previous editions of the book were excellent, but the expansion of the present volume should add considerably to its usefulness. It will undoubtedly continue to be widely used for both class work and general reference. REPORTS OF THE BIOCHEmaCAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE. Vol. VI, 1940-1941. Franklin Institute, Newark, Delaware. 94 x 7; Col- lection of reprints. The papers presented in this volume (23 in number) have been reprinted from various sources and cover a wide range of subjects in the field of biochemistry and physicochemistry in relation to disease, experimental physiology, etc. Ellice McDonald, Director, con- tributes an interesting progress report of the work of the Institute-in its fifth year in 1940, at the time that the report was written. In the latter half of the volume are reprinted notes from the Biochemical Research Foundation which have appeared in the Journal of the Institute. These are concerned largely with methodology and techniques and abstracts of experimental work and seminar re- ports. SEX SEX AND RACE. A History of White, Negro, and Indian Miscegenation in the Two Americas. Volume II. The New World. By J. A. Rogers. J. A. Rogers Historical Researches, New York. $3.00. 9 x 6; 409; 1942.</page><page sequence="32">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 299 This unusual compilation of old and new data, facts and more or less plausible assertions, amazing and risque "case histories," sound and biased theories, and nu- merous, but poorly reproduced, pictures, all appertain- ing to racial hybridization in the New World, is of interest to the historian and sociologist rather than to the biologist. The first 150 pages deal with Latin America, the remainder with Anglo-Saxon America. Race-mixture in South America is more intensive than anywhere else in the World. Many men of mixed ancestry have played prominent r6les in Latin American history and culture. There exists little racial dis- crimination to this day, indeed, even beauty contests are not restricted to whites in Brazil. It is a pity that far too little scientific study has been made so far of this huge "melting pot" which represents an anthro- pological experiment on a continental scale and with unpredictable outcome. That miscegenation in North America has been and still is more wide-spread than is commonly believed, seems apparent from this volume. Of the many and often disconnected chapters in the second part of the book the following samples may here be named: "White people sold as Negro slaves," Rivalry between white wives and Negro concubines," Rich Negroes with white wives during slavery," "Noted white Americans with Negro ancestry," "Hannah Elias, the black Cleopatra," and among the appendices "Body odors and their sexual effect." The author's diagnoses regarding racial purity are not very scientific. Thus he states: "It is not improb- able that Columbus was of mixed blood. His com- plexion was olive; his cheek-bones were high, and his lips, as seen in the Yanez portrait, were of the full Negroid kind." The book contains no conclusions and no index. It is evident that the author regards the prevalent treatment of the Negro in North America as unjustifiable and that he seems to favor removal of all social and legal barriers to race-mixture. He does not appear to be aware of the fact that racial hybridiza- tion is primarily a biological problem. BIOMETRY STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN BIOLOGY. By K. Mather with a Foreword by R. A. Fisher. Methuen and Company, London. 16s. 8' x 51; 247; 1943. This book would be more appropriately entitled "Sig- nificance Tests for Biological Data" for it is limited almost exclusively to that subject. The use of the broader title may be due to the fact that the author's own uses of analysis have been so much confined to sampling tests that he thinks of these as making up the whole field. In fact he states: "Practically the whole field of present-day statistical analysis depends upon the comparison of variances and co-variances" (p. 35) and again, "The use of the c, t, x2 and z distributions forms the last stage of the statistical analysis of a set of data. The preceding operations are concerned with reducing the data to a state in which the question at issue can be answered by means of a comparison between observed and expected deviations in the way made possible by the test distributions" (p. 48). When we consider the large body of work in physical biology, physiology, epidemiology, etc., where rational equations have been developed from a study of the observations, the last stage seems a long way beyond significance tests, useful as they are along the way. In the last chapter the author mentions that these tests are actually only a part of the story, for he says, "Broadly speaking, statistical operations fall into two categories, viz. tests of significance and estimation of parameters" (p. 203). But even though he devotes a part of this chapter as well as some sections of the preceding ones to the subject of estimation, the reader is left with the impression that when we have deter- mined the probability that the parameters differ sig- nificantly, our problem is done. The significance tests are presented largely through applied problems which are very well chosen. The interpretations of the tests are not always justified, however. For example, in discussing the tests men- tioned above, the author states, "Thus rigorous in- ferences may be reached from observational data alone, without involving any assumptions about the parent populations" (p. 49). What he should say is that no assumptions are made about the parameters of the parent populations, but since the distributions are assumed to be normal and it can not be known whether this assumption is correct, the inferences are not rig- orous in the sense implied. There is some tendency to allow incorrect state- ments for the sake of simplification. For example, it is stated that the value of the center of the parent normal curve, ui, and of a may be estimated in various ways. Two ways are suggested for estimating a, by averaging the deviations from the mean, ignoring sign, or by get- ting the root mean square. It is then stated, "Now these various ways of estimating ,u and a would all lead to the same value, viz. the true value of each parameter, if an infinitely large number of observations were available" (p. 27). This certainly creates the erroneous impression that in an infinite series of ob- servations from a normal distribution, the mean devia- tion and the standard deviation are the same. The book must therefore be read critically and the beginning student should be warned that he may have to correct some of the over-simplified interpretations as he increases his understanding of the subject, and will certainly have to enlarge his ideas as to what tatis- tical analysis means.</page><page sequence="33">300 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ThE FuNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES oF MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS with Special Reference to the Requirements of Actuaries and Vital Statisticians and an Outline of a Course in Graduation. By Hugh H. Wolfenden. The Macmillan Company of Canada, Toronto. $5.00. 81 x 51; xv + 379; 1942. This text-book is presented "with special reference to the requirements of actuaries and vital statisticians." The particular requirements which the author had in mind were those pertinent to acquiring a broad view of the subject matter, and this has govemed the rather unusual arrangement of the book. The first 150 pages cons'titute the body of the text and, in eleven chapters, present not only the topics included in the usual ele- mentary text but also such subjects as systems of generalized frequency curves, various curves of rela- tionship between two variables, methods of curve fit- ting including least squares, outlines of recent re- searches and of a course in graduation. Mathematical derivations and applications to numerical material are omitted from this part of the discussion. The second part of the book is divided into three sections: A, History (25 pages); B, Mathematics and inter- pretations (85 pages); and C, Applications (87 pages). There are also two bibliographies, the first containing publications of historical significance (190 titles), and the second, those of present value (177 titles). The book is adequately indexed. This form of presentation is very convenient in using the book as a reference text or handbook. The begin- ning student will probably find the initial sections somewhat too condensed and be forced to refer back and forth from the text to the sections on application and interpretation. Fortunately these are well cross- indexed. That the author finds some difficulty in maintaining the sectional separation is indicated by the inclusion within the text itself of discussions and interpretations of some topics. For example, the presentation of Student's z and t distributions is fol- lowed by four pages (pp. 46 to 49) of discussion of the assumptions, meaning and applicability of the tests based on these distributions. This type of discussion is very useful as an integral part of the exposition of method and might well have been used more liberally. The methods for the most part are presented very clearly. In Chapter III on the point binomial and normal curve, there is some confusion created by the use of n both for the size of sample and the number of samples (pages 12 and 17). The book unquestionably furnishes a useful addi- tion to the list of statistical texts, partly because it considers statistical analysis much more comprehen- sively than do most texts and partly because it has a fresh viewpoint. ON TEE PRINCIPLES OF STATISTICAL INFERENCE. Four Lectures Delivered at the University of Notre Dame February, 1941. Notre Dame Mathematical Lectures Number 1. By Abraham Wald. Notre Dame, Indiana. $1.00. 9 x 6; 47; 1942 (paper). In this publication, four lectures which were delivered at the University of Notre Dame in February, 1941, are presented in book form. The material is organized here in six sections, as follows: I. Introduction, in which the problem of statistical inference is formulated and the underlying concepts discussed; II. The Ney- man-Pearson theory of testing a statistical hypothesis; III. R. A. Fisher's theory of estimation; IV. The theory of confidence intervals; V. Asymptotically most powerful tests and asymptotically shortest con- fidence intervals; VI. Outline of a general theory of statistical inference. The final section contains a consideration of certain restrictions present in the theories previously discussed and outlines a more general theory free of these re- strictions. The author discusses three steps essential in building up such a theory: 1. Formulation of the general problem of statistical inference. 2. Definition of the "best" procedure for making statistical decisions, i.e. definition of the "best" statistical decision function. 3. Solution of the mathematical problem of calcu- lating the "best" statistical decision function. He points out that the second step is always to a certain extent arbitrary, and that differences between tests for the same problem lie in this question of defini- tion. The book is necessarily condensed but the basic concepts are clearly presented. A brief bibliography referring to more extensive discussions of the matter is appended. THE DESIGN oF EXPERIMENTS. Third Edition. By R. A. Fisher. Oliver and Boyd, Ltd., Edinburgh. 12s. 6d. 84 x 52; 236; 1942. The third edition of this book differs only slightly from the first, published in 1935, and the second published a year later. The new material in this edition consists of two new sections in the chapter on "confounding"- a technique designed to study and control the hetero- geneity in the material. The ideas presented are an extension of those on the techniques of experimentation discussed in Chapter VIII of the author's Statistical Methods for Research Workers. The first two chapters which are an intro- duction and a discussion of the principles of experimen- tation orient the reader with regard to Fisher's phi- losophy of scientific experimentation and are worth</page><page sequence="34">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 301 careful reading in order to understand the emphasis the author places on certain portions of statistical methodology. His point of view is summed up in the statement, "Every experiment may be said to exist only [italics ours] in order to give the facts a chance to disprove the null hypothesis" (p. 16). That is, he states that the discovery of whether or not a significant difference exists is the sole purpose of the experiment, rather than an estimation of the order of the difference, the size of the parameters, or the development of new hypotheses. In the course of the discussion the author does in- dicate that at least a part of the interest of the experi- menter is in the magnitude of the parameters found. Nevertheless the main consideration in designing experiments is oriented to those techniques of sig- nificance tests included under the general head of analysis of variance. Particular attention is given to problems arising in agricultural experimentation but the discussion is by no means confined to that field. TABLES OF PROBABILITY FUNCTIONS.

Conducted under the Sponsorship of the National Bureau of Standards. Arnold N. Lowan, Technical Director. National Bureau of Standards, Washing- ton. $2.00. 10' x 74; xxi + 344; 1942. This volume is one in a series of mathematical tables prepared by the Project for the Computation of Mathe- matical Tables. The two tables included give areas and ordinates in a normal probability curve of unit standard devia- tion, corresponding to a given deviation from the cen- ter. In Table I the areas are given within the range 41x and in Table II, outside the range 4x. The functions are tabulated to 15 decimal places in Table I, the argument being given at intervals of .0001 from 0 to 1, and at intervals of .001 from 1 to 7.8. Table II gives the function to 7 significant figures in the range of x from 6 to 10 at intervals of .01. These tables are a valuable extension of previous tables not only because they save the trouble of inter- polation and extrapolation frequently required in using more condensed tables, but because they furnish a source from which various types of condensed tables may be taken.

PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR BnzD DISPLAY. An Introduction to the Study of Bird Psychology. By Edward A. Armstrong. Cambridge, at the Uni- versity Press. $5.50. 84 x 54; xvi + 381; 1942. The study and interpretation of bird behavior on a scientific basis has only recently been achieved. The advancement has been rapid and the nature of the world in which the bird lives is now being revealed by the careful observations of the modem ornithologist. How rapid these strides have been is indicated by the wealth of data presented in this volume. The writer does not limit display to the conspicuous ceremonial activities of some birds, but includes any activity that initiates a response. Thereby the writer justifies the subtitle of this volume. The author begins by describing the ceremonies of the gannet, a species that is large, showy, and easy to study. After analyzing the displays exhibited by this bird, the details of the various ceremonies are elaborated upon with examples from other species. Each type of display is thoroughly described and its significance discussed. An attempt is also made to trace the evolu- tion of certain behavior characteristics. Thus, nest building is conceived as developing from aimless actions arising under emotional stress. These activities, if favorable and valuable in assisting the survival of the species, become formalized and fixed and gradually change into a definite activity pattern that culminates in the construction of a nest. The function of courtship feeding is to stimulate and maintain the emotional relationship between the pair of birds. In this case the female behaves like a young bird by quivering her wings and by assuming the attitude and uttering the</page><page sequence="35">302 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY notes of a young bird. The writer interprets this ac- tion as a recapitulation on the part of the female- during immaturity the bird was craving food, in ma- turity the craving she feels is for sex satisfaction, al- though she approaches it through the channels formed by an earlier desire. Birds are tied down to fixed artificial displays which help maintain physiological harmony. If the recipient is out of rhythm, a set of abnormal, ineffective, and unrelated reactions are released, but if the birds are attuned, the recipient of the formalized display re- sponds in the proper manner. Likewise many cere- monies have as a sole purpose the attainment of physiological rhythm. These gestures are then a sub- stitute for speech with each species having its own language, but only the right key will open the lock that releases the functional activities of the bird. Some of the topics include disablement reactions, greeting ceremonies, social ceremonies and social hierarchy, arena displays, territory, song-flight and others. Each topic in turn is developed and expanded with comparisons drawn between bird behavior and that of other animals, including man. In fact some of the latter comparisons are rather ingenious, although the critical reviewer may not be impressed by the resemblance. In such a study, derived mostly from field observa- tions, the accuracy of the observer is of prime impor- tance. For this reason each statement is carefuliy annotated. The writer has also strived to avoid any anthropomorphic interpretations, long associated with the anecdotal school of bird watchers. As a conse- quence the data offered herein form a valuable and use- ful storeroom of information as well as a significant contribution to the analysis of bird behavior. There are some interpretations to which all may not agree and some that may be based on insufficient evidence, but the writer is not dogmatic. The scientific names of the birds mentioned in the text are given in an appendix. The bibliography con- sists of thirty pages and is in itself a valuable con- tribution. This book should not be overlooked by any bird student or by anyone interested in animal behavior or related fields. AUTONOmic REGULATIONS: Their Significance for Physiology, Psychology and Neuropsychiatry. By Ernst Gellhorn. Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York. $5.50. 9 x 6; xii + 373; 1943. This is a very welcome book on the interrelations of the various elements of the autonomic system and their relations with cortical cerebral activities. The book has developed out of Gellhorn's lectures at the Univer- sity of Illinois, College of Medicine, and the numerous illustrations in the text for the most part have come from his laboratories. The book is divided into four parts: First, a general introduction devoted to anatomical and physiological foundations of the autonomic system. The second part deals with adjustment reactions involving pri- marily the respiratory and circulatory systems; for example, adjustment reaction to carbon dioxide, to anoxia, to asphyxia, to hemorrhage, to hypoglycemia, and the autonomic regulation of cerebral circulation. Part three is concerned with the autonomic-endocrine integration, the nervous regulation of the hormones of the hypophysis, the sympathetico-adrenal and vago- insulin systems. Part four is concerned with au- tonomic-somatic integration, the r6le of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in anoxia, hypo- glycemia, and hemorrhage; fundamental differences in the reaction of the autonomic and somatic nervous sys- tems and their significance for adjustment reactions; the relation of the autonomic and somatic nervous systems; and the autonomic basis of emotion. Part five deals with the results and applications-physio- logical results, and clinical results and applications. The physiological result finally is concerned with an effort at development of an organismal physiology, and in the final part, the clinical results, the material points up to an effort at a physiological interpretation of schizophrenia. The material is lucidly presented, and even a person who is relatively unskilled in the vast amount of work that has been done on the autonomic system will have no great difficulty in following the presentation, par- ticularly since each chapter ends with a very useful and comprehensive summary of the details previously pre- sented. There is a most impressive bibliography, and author and subject index. It is no fault of the author that the chapter on the physiological basis for schizophrenia is perhaps the least telling. His efforts to bring together the physio- logical consequences of the various types of shock treat- ment is most useful, and may furnish a basis for further efforts to control this most difficult of all disease processes. The researcher in psychosomatic effects should find in this volume numerous starting points for further investigations. CUCKOO PROBLEMS. By E. C. Stuart Baker. H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., London. 25s. 8' x 54; xvi + 207; 1942. It is a well-known ornithological fact that the majority of parasitic cuckoos lay eggs that resemble to a greater or less degree the egg of the selected foster parent. The writer's first problem is to bring forth some evi- dence to show that this adaptation is necessary for the survival of the cuckoo. Desertions were found more frequently in nests wherein the parasite's egg did not match the fosterer's very closely and some observations</page><page sequence="36">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 303 indicate that the unlike egg was actually ejected. Sev- eral experiments were performed to show that birds can discriminate unlike eggs, hence it is believed that this egg mimicry is essential. The second problem attempts an answer to the ques- tion whether any evolution has taken place in adapta- tion of cuckoo eggs to those of the fosterer. Resem- blance of eggs is not so close in Western Europe as in Central and Eastern Europe or in Asia. The writer therefore presumes that the cuckoo existed in Asia and Eastern Europe longer than in the West, and therefore had a longer time to perfect its adaptation. Time is thus the dominating factor in the evolution of adaptation in cuckoos' eggs. This reasoning is used to explain why the British Common Cuckoo lays eggs at variance with its victim's. The writer discusses how the eggs are laid in the nest, citing two definite methods, but still expressing the belief that the bird in some cases must actually pick up the egg in its bill to deposit it in an inaccessible nest. No direct confirmation of this act is proffered, all the evidence being merely circumstantial. Recog- nition of cuckoos' eggs, territories, the manner in which young cuckoos eject the fosterer's eggs and other prob- lems of vital interest in connection with the cuckoo are other topics taken up. It is to be regretted that the writer uses the word 'proven' so often, for although much evidence is pre- sented to favor his premises, yet much of it was gathered from second hand sources and is therefore open to sus- picion. The eggs were apparently gathered in a ran- dom fashion and consequently the reliability of the sampling is to be questioned. However, the writer's 70 years of experience with cuckoos and their eggs certainly earns him the title of an authority on the sub- ject and much valuable and incomparable data lies packed within these covers. Colored plates show clearly the resemblances or dissimilarities between the parasite's eggs and those of the victim. In addition, there is a lengthy annotated list of the eggs in the writer's collection which total well over 5000 in number. MENTAL HEALTH IN COLLEGE. By Clements C. Fry with the Collaboration of Edna G. Rostow. Tke Commonwealth Fund, New York. $2.00. 9 x 57; xix + 369; 1942. Fry, one of the original staff of the Division of College Psychiatry and Mental Health at Yale University and its director for some years, has, with the collaboration of Edna G. Rostow, Research Assistant in Psychiatry and Mental Hygiene, brought together a resume of the case material of the past 17 years since the serv- ice's founding. In this volume there is a great deal of important material concerned with the problems in adaptation of college students to the college life and to the facts of their own personality development, specifically the matter of family relationships, and of sexual growth, behavior, and attitudes. These topics are handled in a' very broad, inclusive, and sensible manner, and will appeal to all of those people who look to the col- leges as a source of something besides technical in- formation. The last two of the four parts of the book deal with reactions to the undergraduate environment and special problems, particularly among the graduate and professional schools. It is to be noted that serious disorders falling into the genuine psychotic groups are relatively rare. The problems are essentially those of personality adjust- ment, essentially within the limits of the normal. To single out one item of particular interest in this very welcome book, one may mention a very regrettable item, namely, that those students of the medical school who came for psychiatric help had a much less open mind and inquiring attitude about psychotherapy than the students from any other one group. One would like to know whether this state of affairs would be duplicated at other schools. If so, we are faced with the conclusion that the students in that branch of science which inevitably will be most concerned with personality problems are showing a most regret- table resistance to the understanding of certain facts of life, deficiency in which will prove a handicap to their efforts at treatment of patients. This is no new prob- lem, but some of us had thought that a considerable stride had been made toward eradicating it. Parents with students in college might well be glad that the kind of development represented at Yale and encompassed in this book has spread rather generally. Fry and Rostow have done a very good job in present- ing the factual material of their years of work. PSYCHOLOGY IN NURSING PRACTICE. By Philip Lawrence Harriman, Lela L. Greenwood, and Charles E. Skinner. The Macmillan Company, New York. $3.25. 8' x 58; ix + 483; 1942. This text-book of psychology for student nurses dis- cusses the fundamental psychological notions of be- havior, emotions and motives; consciousness, concepts, meanings, thinking, the concept of self, volition, etc. Anatomicophysiological phenomena in so far as they influence psychological processes, or are supposed to do so, are rather extensively treated. This seems to be rather useful as the thought of most physicians evolves along the same lines. From the practical purpose of the book it is understandable that special accent is laid on educational and pathological psychology. By appropriate remarks in the general chapters, as well as in special chapters (Personality and its development, Mental hygiene, Psychology of the patient, Psychology and the art of nursing), the special psychological prob- lems of the nurse are developed.</page><page sequence="37">304 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY One may agree or disagree with every single affirma- tion in such a vast survey; it must be recognized that the book in general is a very fair and able cross section of present day psychology, written with a lot of com- mon sense and avoiding the somewhat sweetish style which has sometimes spoiled other nursing textbooks. Except in the excellent chapter of R. M. Lindner on "Mental deficiency and mental disorder" (praise- worthy also for his cautious attitude towards shock treatment), there is a certain tendency to minimize the contribution of psychoanalysis which seems unjust to the present reviewer, although he is himself by no means an adept of this school. After all Freud has influenced present day psychological thought and terminology more than anyone else. Even the frus- tration-aggression concept, so liberally used throughout the book, would probably not exist without Freud. In solving rather well the difficult problem of sum- marizing the psychology of our society, the book is unintentionally an interesting and not always pleasant to look at mirror of this special, somewhat hectic mentality. It is one of the many excellent textbooks the possession of which other professions may envy nurses. It is a very good idea to prepare nurses men- tally for a profession, psychologically so difficult, in a sensible and scientific way. Indeed it is a pity that the same is not done for young doctors who, to a large extent, face the same problems and are by no means better equipped by nature to master this task. INFANT AND CHILD IN THE CULTURE OF TODAY: The Guidance of Development in Home and Nursery School. By Arnold Gesell and Frances L. Ilg in collaboration with Janet Learned and Louise B. Ames. Harper and Brothers, New York and London. $4.00. 91 x 7'; [xii] + [3991; 1943. Gesell and Ilg, the pediatrician in the Clinic of Child Development at Yale University, have presented a very interesting textbook of infant and child develop- ment in the democratic culture of today. The text is important for its two theses: First, that the child is a growing concern and the r6le of the adult is one of collaboration and guidance rather than training and imposition of outside disciplines; and second, the cul- ture in which the child grows is important for his even- tual outcome. As a practical matter the book presents a "behavior day" and chart, done in detail as all such things are done in the Yale Clinic, with representative behavior profiles from the beginning of things up to 5 years and after, with very good summaries of what one might expect from youngsters at various age levels. There is a good chapter concemed with the nursery school as a guiding center, with answers to the peren- nial question, "Should my child go to nursery school?" Observation of the "behavior day" leads to increased emphasis on the child's spontaneity for cues for col- laborative guidance. This is particularly startling in the matter of child feeding, where it is recom- mended that the child be fed whenever it is hungry. Grandmother would approve of this. The last part of the book has to do with the philos- ophy of growth, an attitude toward the whole problem of child development which might very well be made a sine qua non of our professional dealings with children. A very useful appendix gives actual samples of the behavior day chart, organization of the Yale Nursery, toys, play materials, and equipment for various ages, books for preschool children, musical records for in- fants and young children, and finally selected readings in the field of child guidance. The format is very attractive, and the material is lucidly presented with a minimum of highly technical material. It can be generally recommended as an excellent text. WOLF-CMLDREN AND FERAL MAN. IV. Contribu- tions of the University of Denver. By the Reverend J. A. L. Singh and Robert M. Zingg. Harper and Brothers, New York. $4.00. 84 x 54; xli + 379; 1942. So much has been written in the popular press about human children reared by wild animals, but so little has been definitely authenticated that the exact status of these stories is still on the borderline between myth and truth. The first part of this book is a diary of the wolf-children of Midnapore, India, who were found by the Reverend Singh. Their day by day activities, their development physically and mentally is narrated in simple style. Unfortunately the kindly missionary was no scientist and hence many important facts have been left out and many observations loosely made. In that respect the diary leaves much to be desired. The editor, R. M. Zingg, has gone to much trouble to convince the reader of the authenticity of this diary which bears the stamp of approval of several noted scientific persons. The tale itself is an absorbing study of the effects wrought on the children by their feral environment. Even though the children associated with human individuals for several years, they were very slow to regain any human trait; in fact, Kamala was only beginning to walk upright and to speak a few words when death caught up with her after nine years. The second part of the book, by Zingg, is a review of the literature and known facts concerning other cases of feral man and extreme isolation, especially the celebrated case of Kaspar Hauser. A thoroughly entertaining book deserving careful study.</page><page sequence="38">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 305 THE RELATION OF CERTAIN ANOMALIES OF VISION AND LATERAL DOMINANCE TO READING DISABILITY.

Alden and John D. Ifft. California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco. $1.00. 10 x 7; 59; 1943 (paper). The History of Science is a legitimate field of in- vestigation in its own right, and the biographies of those who have made history constitute perhaps the most fascinating chapter in this story. Historians generally agree to date the beginning of modern science with the publication of the Copernican theory just four centuries ago this year. But European civilization was already ancient when Copernicus gave his masterpiece to the world from his death bed, and those upon whom his mantle fell had to fight their way against the accumulated beliefs and prejudices of the ages. Except on the shores of the North Atlantic Ocean the earliest scientists were never more than tem- porary residents. They associated with the settlers but were not of them. Humboldt and Bonpland, Wal- lace and Bates, Burton and Speke, Peron and Lesueur (and perhaps Edmond Halley should be included among these) never identified themselves with the tillers of the soil but always looked forward to an even- tual return to the fatherland where they might analyze their material and observations and draw conclusions from them at their convenience. The same thing was true of the Pacific Northwest; Steller, Solander, Collig- non, and Longinos came, ;collected, observed, and de- parted, leaving no influence upon the incipient civiliza- tion that was even then struggling to be born. The only exceptions that come readily to mind are Miguel Venegas, Thaddeus Haenke, and David Livingstone, each in a different continent. On the Atlantic Seaboard a very different situation obtained. While the itinerant naturalists Mark Catesby and Peter Kalm were making their ephemeral peregrinations throughout the Appalachian piedmont there arose a group of iindigenous personalities in whom the scientist and the pioneer were aptly blended. Only in the shadow of a slowly advancing frontier could such men have been produced as Franklin and Rittenhouse, John and William Bartram, John Speak- man and Thomas Say, Adam Kuhn and Benjamin S. Barton, and here alone were conditions so ripe as to induce such foreigners as Wilson and Maclure from Scotland, Logan and Priestley from England, Michaux and Audubon from France, Troost from Holland, Aller from Germany, and Rafinesque from Constantinople to leave their homes in the old countries and throw in their lots with the pioneers. As the American Philosophical Society is the oldest scientific institution in the United States it is only ap- propriate that it should celebrate its bicentennial anniversary by devoting an issue of its proceedings to a recapitulation of the careers of some of these trail blazers of science. By a happy coincidence the oldest scientific institution west of the Mississippi has done the same thing for those who labored on the Pacific Coast. In both instances there is revealed a tendency for the pioneer naturalist to have begun his career as a physi- cian or surgeon, who engaged in natural history as a recreation but whose achievements in this field even- tually eclipsed those in that of medicine. This is true not only of such naturalists as Anderson, Eschscholtz, and Hinds, who accompanied respectively the expedi- tions led by Cook, Kotzbue, and Belcher but also of Cadwalader Cobden and Alexander Garden, resident physicians of Philadelphia and Charleston. Apart from this resemblance the two groups had little in common, except that there was one man who played a part in the scientific development of both coasts- Thomas Nuttall, the Englishman, who was by turns botanist, ornithologist, and malacologist, and who not only held positions on the staffs of the Academy of Natural Sciences and Harvard University, but also explored the head waters of the Missouri river within a decade of Lewis and Clark, traversed the Oregon trail seven years before Jim Bridger, tramped the beaches of California beneath the flags of the Russian empire and the Mexican republic, rounded the Horn</page><page sequence="39">306 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY in a windjammer over a century ago, and then as an anticlimax retired to lead the sedate life of a country gentleman in England. It is surprising that Nuttall's biographies in these two publications are strangely inconsistent. One writer locates him in Philadelphia during the Napo- leonic war; the other has him in London at this time. One states that after his return to England in 1841 he never again left the British Isles; the other states that it was only a short time until he was back in America again. There are some other peculiar errors in both works, such as the statement that Sesse y Lacosta accom- panied the Malaspina expedition. It is true that both parties were in Mexico in 1791 but Sesse arrived a year earlier and there is no evidence that they ever joined forces. Also the statement that David Rittenhouse had been employed by William Penn to run the bound- ary between his holdings and those of Lord Baltimore is erroneous. Penn had been dead for fourteen years when Rittenhouse was born, and if Rittenhouse (who was probably the greatest scientific genius the Western world has yet produced) surveyed any part of the boundary at a later date, no mention of this is made in the field notes of Mason and Dixon, or of Colonel Graham, or in the narrative of Mathews which has been accepted by both Pennsylvania and Maryland as authoritative. What Rittenhouse did was to accom- plish a much more difficult task. He surveyed the boundary between Pennsylvania and Virginia, at the same time engaging by correspondence in a diplomatic debate with James Madison in which he persuaded the Virginian to yield every point at issue. The omission of the name of Jos6 Longinos Marti- nez is unfortunate, for he was the first naturalist to enter Alta California overland, and the first to traverse the length of the state. His predecessors had all ac- companied naval expeditions who put in at Monterey and their collecting was confined to the immediate vicinity of that port. Finally, if Thomas Sully really painted the portrait of James Logan attributed to him he was guilty of an anachronism, for Logan died in 1751 and Sully was born in 1783. As these pages are perused we meet many of the romantic personages of history, such as Adelbert von Chamisso, who wrote the story of Peter Schlemihl who sold his shadow to the devil; John K. Townsend, artist and ornithologist who did much of the work for which Audubon got the credit; Francisco Hernandez, the court physician of Philip the Second who botanized in Amer- ica half a century before the Pilgrims arrived at Ply- mouth; James Logan, private amanuensis of William Penn, an astronomer and mathematician of no mean ability, and a personal correspondent of both Newton and Halley; David Zeisberger, the Pennsylvania Ger- man apostle to the Indians and our first anthropolo- gist; and Titian Peale, whose father Charles Willson Peale was a prominent portrait painter and the first American to excavate and exhibit a mastodon. It is a pity that neither of these works has an index, for both are crowded with interesting and important items of information which are hard to find the second time. PROCEEDINGS OF THE EIGHTH AMERIcAN SCIENTIFIC CONGRESs HELD IN WASHINGTON MAY 10-18, 1940 under the Auspices of the Government of the United States of America. Volume I: Organization, Activities, Resolutions, and Delegations. Volume III: Biological Sciences. Volume VI: Public Health and Medicine. Volume VIII: Statistics. Department of State, Washington, D. C. 92 x 7; Vol. I: 539; Vol. III: 530; Vol. VI: 496; Vol. VIII: 365; 1943 (paper). In 1896, when plans were being made for the Silver- Jubilee of the Argentine Scientific Society to be held in Buenos Aires in 1898, invitations were issued for the convening of a Congress of Latin-American scientists. This meeting, held April 10, 1898, became known as the "First Latin-American Scientific Congress." It was followed in 1901 by the Second Latin-American Scientific Congress held in Montevideo, and in 1905 by the Third Congress at Rio de Janeiro. As in previous meetings there were individual sections, each devoted to a special science: public and private law, ethnology, archeology, linguistics, medicine and sanitation, and other subjects. It was at the close of this meeting that a resolution was adopted to hold the Fourth Latin- American Scientific Congress at Santiago de Chile in 1908 and to restrict the agenda "in so far as possible to matters of a distinctly inter-American nature." It was also voted to extend an invitation to the United States of America to take part in the conference. The Fourth Latin-American Congress, held in Santi- ago, December 25, 1908 to January 5, 1909, thus also became the First Pan American Scientific Congress. " .... the official delegates of the various countries were the ranking scientigts in the service of their respec- tive governments. Furthermore, the majority of the great institutions of learning in America evidenced their full accord with the objectives of the Congress by sending leading members of their faculties as dele- gates." The fifth in the series (Second Pan American Scientific Congress) convened in Washington on De- cember 27, 1915; the sixth in the series (Third Pan American Scientific Congress), at Lima, Perd, on December 20, 1924. As was the case at all previous sessions many delegates attended the meetings. It was at this time that the decision was reached that the next meeting should be known as the "Seventh American Scientific Congress." The economic crisis of the late Twenties and early Thirties resulted in two postponements of the Seventh Congress and when the</page><page sequence="40">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 307 meeting was finally held it was in Mexico City, from September 8 to 17, 1935. Once again, as in all the previous assemblies, there was evidenced the threefold value of scientific collabora- tion on an inter-American scale: the fraternity of nations, the advancement of science through the opening of various national sources to scientists of other nations, and in a particular sense, the benefit derived from the personal discussion of those con- clusions which, after painstaking research, the scientists of all the American nations had submitted t6 the Congress. The Eighth American Scientific Congress was held in Washington in 1940. The various sectional meetings were as follows: anthropology, biology, geology, agri- culture and conservation, public health and medicine, physical and chemical sciences, statistics, history and geography, international law, public law and juris- prudence, economics and sociology, and education. The volumes of the proceedings of the various sections have been appearing within the past year or so. These are not for sale but there is a limited distribution by the Department of State to participating individuals and organizations and to certain depository libraries and institutions. Volume I of the Proceedings is concerned with in- troductory matter, organization, rules and regulations, addresses of The President of the United States, as well as of other officials, and responses of the various repre- sentatives of the American countries and delegates, minutes of the various section meetings, and resolutions and recommendations. The latter half of the volume is taken up with a list of official delegates and members of the Congress, giving titles and committee member- ship. In Volume III are reported the papers, either in full or in abstract form, given in the division of the bio- logical sciences. They are grouped under the headings of General biology (25 papers), Botany (27 papers), and Zoology (29 papers). In the volume on Public Health and Medicine (Volume VI) the grouping of the papers is as follows: Health education and sanitation (13 papers), Nutrition and dentistry (21 papers), Heart and blood diseases (17 papers), Communicable diseases (6 papers), Leprosy (6 papers), Bartonellosis (4 papers), Brucellosis (4 papers), Chagas' disease (3 papers), Tuberculosis (15 papers), Plague (3 papers), Yellow fever (4 papers), Malaria (7 papers), Rickett- siasis (5 papers), Miscellaneous communicable diseases (12 papers), Cancer (6 papers), Maternology and Peuri- culture (4 papers), Psychiatry (4 papers), Miscellaneous (17 papers). In Volume VIII, dealing with subjects from a statistical point of view, there was no division of the papers into special groups. Many of the 50 papers presented were concerned with population prob- lems. All of the papers are important in their special fields and many of them are of considerable general interest. While many are in English a goodly number are in Spanish and Portuguese. Perhaps one of the impor- tant lessons to be learned from these volumes is the growing need for a better understanding of the lan- guages of the South American countries on the part of North American scientific workers. That the Con- gress has become a firmly established institution is evident by the large attendance at its meetings and the interesting reports of the delegates. An understanding of the problems presented and the interchange of ideas can be immeasurably advanced by a wider knowledge of the languages of those attending the meetings. A HiSTORY OF ScNcE and Its Relations with Philosophy and Religion. Third Edition, Revised and Enlarged. By Sir William Cecil Dampier (Formerly Whetham). Cambridge: at the University Press. $2.95. 9' x 6Q; xxiii + 574; 1942. In this readable book the author has attempted to trace the history of science from the time of the Greeks to the present day-its origin, its development and its achieve- ments-and to relate it to philosophy and religion. The author states in the preface that "Men of sci- ence, most of whom used naively to assume that they were dealing with ultimate reality, are coming to see more clearly the true nature of their work.... The approach to reality, through science, therefore, gives only aspects of reality, pictures drawn on simplified lines, but not reality itself." It is this idea that the author impresses on the mind of the reader as he reveals the fascinating story of science from its earliest begin- nings down through the most recent developments in the fields of physics, biology and anthropology-i.e. he treats "of the growth of those activities which have revealed the individual atom and opened to our vision the depths of space, which have revolutionized philo- sophic thought and given us the means of advancing our material welfare to a level beyond the dreams of former ages." As is often the case with such works, this book is a history of science with the emphasis not on science, but on its philosophical implications. In such a book there are many features which are hard to reconcile with sound scientific practice. There is a general tend- ency to concentrate on the more startling and spec- tacular advances without an adequate consideration of many intervening discoveries which may have been even more important from the standpoint of actual scientific application. There is also an overwhelming tendency for the author to "go beyond his data" in discussing the significance of scientific advances. It is true that he does this with reservations, but it is questionable whether anything is gained by discussing, in the light of present scientific knowledge, such things as free-will and determinism or whether science is capable of reaching ultimate reality. The scientific</page><page sequence="41">308 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY facts are simply inadequate for a scientific discussion of such subjects. This third edition has been expanded to include ex- periments and discoveries of the past few years and contains a new chapter covering the years 1930-1940. The text is amply footnoted and provided with mar- ginal headings. The book may appeal to those with a primarily philosophical interest or to laymen desiring a general historical knowledge of the subject without details, although both may be somewhat disturbed by the ad- vanced mathematical formulations which are stuck here and there in the text with little effort to prepare the reader to understand them. It is hard to see what value these will have for the average reader unless they represent a test of faith, something for the reader to believe, but beyond his ability to solve or understand. For the active scientific worker the book will seem to be somewhat misdirected. THE METHODOLOGY OF PIERRE DUHEm. By Armand Lowinger. Columbia University Press, New York. $2.25. 81 x 51; 184; 1941. The present treatise has been prepared with the hope that it "will stimulate further English exposition of Duhem's ideas, especially his physics and history of science, which are of at least equal importance with his methodology." Pierre Duhem (1861-1916), after receiv- ing his doctorate in the sciences, taught at Lille, Rennes, and finally at Bordeaux, where for many years, until his death, he was Professor of Theoretical Physics on the Faculty of Sciences. One paramount idea dominated his thinking throughout his life but in expanding this idea he proceeded in various directions. He proposed as his objective to work at the creation of a science which would unite the principles of Mechanics with those of Thermodynamics. This science, which one could call general Thermodynamics or Energetics, would unite under common laws: the study of local move- ments by bodies of Mechanics properly so-called, that of their physical or chemical changes of state, or physical Mechanics, finally that of electric phe- nomena and magnetism. Previous to Duhem, thermodynamics was confined to statics. The idea of thermodynamics of bodies in movement, Duhem's most important contribution to science, came to him while he was at the College Stanislas, before he had finished his education at the Ecole Normale. Both Willard Gibbs and Helmholtz influenced his thinking at this stage of his career. Duhem's researches led him into the study of scien- tific method in general and to the exploration of histori- cal fields of scientific doctrines. He made outstanding contributions in both these fields. He traced some of the leading principles of modern science back into the Middle Ages. He found the work of Jordanus Nemora- rius in the thirteenth century forshadowing the principle of virtual displacement. In the dynamics of the "Parisians" of the fourteenth century "he finds fully and clearly developed modern dynamics as formulated by Galileo. Buridan destroys Aristotelian dynamics, which required the continuous action of a motor power in order to sustain motion, by his concept of an impetus." Lowinger's contribution to an understanding of Pierre Duhem is a thoroughly scholarly work. The volume is completely documented, a bibliography is provided,-and the index, carefully prepared, will be found useful. The volume will not only interest the physicist but the reader of general science. SCIENCE IN PROGRESS. Third Series. By Harlow Shapley, Edwin Hubble, Hans A. Bethe, V. K. Zworykin, P. W. Bridgeman, Lionel S. Marks, James Franck, John G. Kirkwook, Perrin H. Long, and Hermann Mark. Edited by George A. Baitsell. Yale University Press, New Haven. $3.00. 9- x 6; xiv + 322; 1942. The past few decades have seen the various fields of scientific endeavor become more and more specialized and, with this development, it has become increasingly difficult for workers in one field to keep up with or even understand current advances in other fields. The National Sigma Xi Lectureships have done much to bridge this gap and the publication of these lectures in book form makes them accessible to many who were not able to hear the original lectures. Each chapter represents a lecture by a man chosen as an outstanding representative of his particular field of research. They are designed for a scientifically trained, but unspecial- ized audience and usually represent an admirable balance between simplicity and precision of presenta- tion. They thus avoid the many inaccuracies and fallacies which always seem to creep in when a writer or speaker attempts to "popularize" science, and yet they avoid many of the complicating details found in the journal literature on any one of these subjects. The chapters vary considerably in regard to the details involved, but all are clearly presented. It is quite possible that many biologists will not be able to follow all of the mathematical manipulations involved in Zworykin's discussion of the electron microscope, but the general discussion of the topic which is also pre- sented will do much to smooth over the mathematical difficulties for most readers. The present volume contains the following lectures: Galaxies, Harlow Shapley; The problem of the expand- ing universe, Edwin Hubble; Energy production in stars, Hans A. Bethe; Image formation by electrons, V. K. Zworykin; Recent work in the field of high pres- sures, P. W. Bridgman; Recent developments in power generation, Lionel S. Marks; Some fundamental as- pects of photosynthesis, James Franck; The structure of liquids, John G. Kirkwood; The mode of action of</page><page sequence="42">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 309 sulfanilamide, Perrin H. Long; and Some scientific aspects of the synthetic rubber problem, by Hermann Mark. This volume is certainly worthwhile reading for any scientist, and represents a valuable addition to the Science in Progress series which has done much to break down the vicious isolation of the various fields of scien- tific research. THE AMATEUR SCIENTIST. Science as a Hobby. By W. Stephen Thomas. W. W. Norton and Com- pany, New York. $2.75. 8 x 538; 291; 1942. The realm of the amateur scientist has too long re- mained obscure, not only to the laity, but to academic circles as well. Into this revealing little volume, the author has gathered a body of interesting and pertinent facts concerning science as a recreational hobby. The amateur scientist has been scrutinized from the standpoint of his home surroundings, his occupation, his organizations, and his scientific contributions. By and large, it is agreed that from the use of a few mo- ments of spare time, the application of a little common sense in the direction of the scientific method, and the exercising of a great deal of patient observation, the amateur scientist has made many contributions in the fields of botany, ornithology, meteorology, archaeology, entomology, horticulture, radio and photography. The amateur scientist clearly possesses a considerable advantage over the academic scientist in his 'scope of interest and activity, since he is not limited solely to those fields of endeavor which promise the greatest financial return, or which are considered of such im- portance as to be subsidized by our leading philan- thropists. The magnitude in which the present war effort has drawn upon the ingenuity and originality of the ama- teur scientist for time-, material-, and money-saving devices for the production of a variety of goods, is only a slight indication of the importance of this phase of scientific activity in the society of the future. For every person young or old, who possesses some spark of scientific curiosity, the contents of this volume will prove to be a real tonic. Appendices A and B carry a distribution by occupa- tion of some 725 amateur scientists, and a series of sample amateur scientific research projects. The volume is provided with an index. THE PRINCIPLES OF FIELD DRAINAGE. By H. H. Nicholson. Cambridge: at the University Press. $3.00. 8' x 54; xi + 165; 1942. The author's ten years of practical field experience in the British Isles have served him well in the inception and preparation of this little volume on the problems and methods of field drainage. His interest and en- thusiasm for the subject are derived from the common sense viewpoint that the better the theory of a problem is understood, the better it can be handled practically in everyday experience. Very little study has been devoted to the problems of field drainage in Britain in the past, but with the present war-time need for more agricultural land, as well as for more runways and landing fields for air transportation, the problem of reclaiming swamp land has received timely and well-advised consideration. The importance of drainage is further emphasized by the fact that something between a third and a half of the total available agricultural land of Britain requires some measure of drainage before it can be put to any use whatsoever. The author has included discussions of soil structure in relation to water, the various methods of drainage best suited to different types of soil, as well as the principles of flood prevention. The work is illustrated with photographs and charts, and is supplied with an abundance of tabular material. A short bibliography and an index are appended. CHEMICAL-TECEMCAL DICTIONARY. (German-English- French-Russian.) By A. W. Mayer. Translated under the Direction of B. N. Menshutkin and M. A. Block. Chemical Publishing Company, Brooklyn. $8.00. 8A x 51; 872; 1942. This is an important book for chemical and technical laboratories and for research workers as well as trans- lators. The rapid progress of scientific work in Russia up to the time of the war, with the consequent output of scientific literature, brought about a need for the means-for the Russian as well as for the English, French, and German workers-of understanding tech- nical terms as they are used in all four languages. In this comprehensive volume of over 850 pages it would seem as though few terms had been omitted. The words are alphabetized in German. We give, as an example of the method of presentation, the following word: Fall-mittel n 11 precipitant; precipitating agent. pr6cipitant m.; agent de pr6cipitation; ocaagaioir;ee cpepCTBO peaRTHIB./alkalisches-. 11 alkaline precipi- tant.
