      <p>Despite disparate legitimating principles and vast differences in population size and diversity, the classical <italic>polis</italic> and the modern liberal democracy have certain problems in common. Among the most fundamental is the problem of educating their citizens toward two very different and often clashing sets of capabilities. Aristotle holds that the first set of capabilities is comprised of the habits of those who are possessed of courage, moderation, generosity, fairness, and other conventional moral virtues as defined, with varying degrees of imperfection, by the laws of the imperfect regimes that populate our world ([1894] 1988, 1998a (henceforth <italic>NE</italic>) 1130b22–26).            <sup>1</sup>
          If the regime is not excessively flawed, and if it is effective in instilling the habits it values, it will inculcate the habits of the person whom Strauss calls the “gentleman” prior to the removal of the “screen” that prevents him from seeing beyond the horizon of the conventional ([1964] 1978, 25–26, 28). The more unbalanced and flawed the underlying principles of the regime, the further from the virtues described in the <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> these habits will be. Education by the most extreme regimes is likely to be one-sided, resulting in a slavish citizenry, defective in self-control (Aristotle [1957] 1986, 1984a (henceforth <italic>Pol.</italic>) 1310a12–38) and ripe for subjugation by a tyrant (1310b14–16). Resistance to this slide into tyranny and the development of fully realized, self-conscious virtue depend upon the development of a second set of capabilities. This second set of capabilities involves knowledge of the true virtues, which Aristotle works to develop and disseminate through <italic>The Nicomachean Ethics</italic>, along with a love of inquiry, which Aristotle models, and is the mostly unspoken message of all his work. In what follows, I intend to show how Aristotle worked to promote the development of that second set of capabilities through the teachings that have come down to us as <italic>The Poetics.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>With that key second set of capabilities, the learner is prepared to deploy mature critical faculties against all habits and their supportive truth claims, including, and perhaps especially, those habits that his own regime inculcates and those truth claims upon which it rests. In the case of democracies, Aristotle criticizes habits of thought by which all persons, values, judgments, and actions are considered equal, and lawlessness is mistaken for happiness (1280a9–13, 1310a25–36, 1317b10–12). Even in the best case, the summation of regime-supportive habits as taught by the best regime, “complete justice,” cannot bridge the gap between habit and the judgment required for action that is truly just. For true justice is not simply the habitual performance of actions required by law. It is a state of being that requires higher levels of sensitivity to contingencies and a greater depth of self-consciousness than mere lawfulness calls for (<italic>NE</italic> 1137a4–14).            <sup>2</sup>
          On the other hand, if inquiry is unaccompanied by enculturation, the shared perceptions and common language necessary for citizenship will dissolve, and the very coherence of inquiry itself will dissipate. Aristotle’s criticism of <italic>The Republic’</italic>s city in speech (<italic>Pol.</italic>1261a4–1264b25) and Hippodamus’s mathematically perfect city (1267b22–1269a28) are also, at their root, repudiations of inquiry divorced from the habits, practices, and attachments of actual people living in actual communities. In embracing both the view that each of us is “of the city” (1337a29) and an ideal of human excellence that gives short shrift to the core regime-supportive habit of martial valour (1324b22–28, 1333b26–29), Aristotle provides the rough outlines of a mean located between altogether rootless abstraction and complete identification with a political community simply because it is one’s own.            <sup>3</sup>
         
      </p>
      <p>Aristotle’s ethical and political works as a whole can be read as a response to the problem of discontinuity between regime-instilled habits and unrestrained inquiry. He “teaches the questions”            <sup>4</sup>
          by guiding those members of his audience who have attained sufficient freedom from passion (<italic>pathos</italic>; <italic>NE</italic> 10956a2–8) through an ascending series of plateaus. At each plateau further ascent is blocked until the learner perceives the gaps and puzzles (<italic>aporiai</italic>) that expose the shortcomings of more conventional perspectives and drive the learner to ascend to a height from which broader vistas come into sight (Collins 2006; Jaffa 1952; Mara 1998; Smith 2001; Strauss 1978; Tessitore 1996). At the same time, he leads the more philosophical members of his audience back to the city. Their return is required not merely because of their obligation to the city that has educated them. It is also, and more urgently, required because of the radical incompleteness, not to mention absurdity and danger, of reason that is divorced from human needs, desires, and attachments (Nichols 1992, 37) and that ignores or suppresses human diversity for the sake of theoretical clarity (Saxonhouse 1988, 1262, 1267, 1272).</p>
      <p>Like Salkever, I hold that <italic>The Poetics</italic> is best read within the context of Aristotle’s political science (1986, 276, 276 fn. 5), which I take to be dedicated to the two-pronged project of civic education as described above. I argue that Aristotle advocates tragedy that enables spectators to overcome tyrannical elements in their own upbringing and to ask how tyrannical elements in their own city might be countered. My effort has three parts. The first part provides a general context for my reading of <italic>The Poetics</italic>, starting with the identification of the primary political objective of the civic education provided by Aristotle, inhibiting the slide into tyranny. The first part will conclude with a discussion of how a reading of <italic>The Poetics</italic> as prophylactic against tyranny through regime interrogation might extend existing scholarship on tragedy and its civic/ religious functions. The second part of my effort will begin with a brief discussion of the effects of tragedies on their audiences as described by <italic>The Poetics</italic>. My discussion relies on the work of Golden in specifying the meaning of the term <italic>“katharsis</italic>” in <italic>The Poetics.</italic> Then I will proceed to look at some of the specific criteria of excellence in the composition of tragedy set forth in <italic>The Poetics</italic>. I will argue that tragedies meeting those criteria would encourage an interrogation of the regime and the habits it instills. Following that, I will consider the two plays that Aristotle considered exemplary, <italic>Iphigenia among the Taurians</italic> and <italic>Oedipus the Tyrant.</italic> I will argue that these plays are exposés of tyranny and invitations to regime interrogation. In the third and final part, I will offer thoughts on some of the difficulties facing contemporary attempts at a similarly ambitious civic education for the citizenry.</p>
      <sec id="sec2">
         <title>Tyranny and Tragedy</title>
         <p>In <italic>The Politics</italic>, Aristotle holds that tyranny is the form of rule to which “none of the free men knowingly submits” (<italic>Pol.</italic> 1295a22–23). It is the “worst” form of rule (1289a39, <italic>NE</italic> 1160b7–9) because it is hostile to all of the forms of human excellence, especially courage, friendliness, and greatness of soul (<italic>Pol.</italic> 1314a14–29). Moreover, tyranny is the negation of citizenship, defined as the “holding in common (<italic>koinōnoi</italic>) of a single city” (1261a1). It is therefore the least “political” (<italic>politeian</italic>) (1293b29) form of rule. That is to say, it is most at odds with the political nature of the human animal (1253a7–10). Tyranny’s preservation requires that it permit “neither leisure, nor leisurely discussion groups to come into being” (1313b3–4). Therefore, it must oppose the characteristically human capability for “speech about the just and the unjust, the advantageous and the disadvantageous” (1253a7–18) and the capabilities developing through such speech for criticism of both the regime in the city and the regime within one’s soul.               <sup>5</sup>
             For this reason, these capabilities are necessarily incompatible with tyranny. The root of Aristotle’s opposition to tyranny is that his political/ethical science is the study of the human being as a living thing with its own excellence as its proper function and highest end, while tyranny is based on the lie that power and what it brings are the highest human ends. That is to say that tyranny is incompatible with a teleological science of human things. For Aristotle’s teleological human science denies that power and the pleasure that power makes possible are the ends of life and insists that disagreements must be resolved through philosophical questioning rather than the application of raw power.</p>
         <p>It is Aristotle’s view that there are two basic varieties of tyranny: barbarous tyranny, and the “Persian” variety (1313b9–10). Both are due to the population’s slavishness. In the case of barbarous tyranny, that slavishness is caused by the population’s ignorance, which results in an incapacity for self-direction (1252b5–9, 1252a30–34), leading to its being ruled despotically. The “Persian,” or “Asian” variety of tyranny is not due to a ignorance, but rather to a deficit of spiritedness (<italic>athuma</italic>) in the population (1327b28), resulting in its acceptance of being ruled by a master, especially if that master appears capable of finding ways to provide for the comfortable survival of the ruled. I will argue that Aristotle sees tragedy as a valuable ally in showing that the barbarous and Persian varieties of tyranny, apparently other and distant, were distressingly close to fourth-century Athens. Here we find Aristotle employing Greek cultural biases against Asians and Europeans to the North and West without endorsing them.</p>
         <p>My focus here is on democracies, rather than on oligarchies, the other regime type commonly found in the cities that Aristotle knew (1296a22–27). In oligarchies, the ruling citizens and the young men who expected to rule could be reached through schools such as Aristotle’s Lyceum because they possessed the wealth and leisure required for that type of education. But in a democracy, there had to be some other means of educating the rulers because most of the relatively inclusive citizenry of a democracy (the <italic>dēmos</italic>) possessed neither the wealth nor the leisure required for the type of education Aristotle provided to those who attended his lectures. A considerable body of scholarship (Cartledge 1997; Euben 1997; Goldhill 1997; Salkever 1986; Seaford 1994; Vernant 1988) has shown that the institution of tragedy was a valuable resource for the education of the <italic>dēmos</italic>, particularly in Athens. I will argue that it was especially valuable for the purposes of identifying some of the tell-tale features of tyranny and showing its negative consequences.</p>
         <p>Tragedy emerged as a religious/political ritual that played an essential role in the civic education of the Athenian citizens (Seaford 1994, 85, 121, 140–43, 205, 252). Moreover, the civic education provided by tragedy was remarkable in its focus on encouraging spectators to question the norms, practices, and hierarchies of their own society (Cartledge 1997, 6; Euben 1997, 188; Goldhill 1997, 55; Vernant 1988, 33). More specifically, Salkever (1986, 276) argues that Aristotle’s <italic>Poetics</italic> does not treat tragedy as an art form with its own self-contained function, independent of the function of the city. Rather he maintains, correctly in my opinion, that <italic>The Poetics</italic> is a work on political education that must be read in the context of the description of human excellence and the city’s role in enabling people to achieve it found in <italic>The Nicomachean Ethics</italic> and <italic>The Politics</italic> respectively. It is Salkever’s contention that the purpose that animates <italic>The Poetics</italic> is to encourage the production of tragedies that persuade the household-oriented, middle-class citizens of moderate democracies to reject the “tyrannical dream” of pursuing happiness by grasping for power (289, 292–98).</p>
         <p>My intention is to extend Salkever’s work in two ways. One way is by arguing that in addition to its goal of encouraging playwrights to guide the middle-class citizens of the best democracies away from the tyrannical dream, <italic>The Poetics</italic> has related goals that are both more general and more specific. The more general goal is to encourage playwrights to compose tragedies that will induce citizens of <italic>all</italic> sorts of democracies, not just the better ones, to look more closely at the regimes they inhabit. Complementing and supporting that general goal is the more specific goal of encouraging playwrights to emulate plays that expose the errors of the principal types of tyranny that Aristotle describes in <italic>The Politics</italic>. The other way in which I hope to extend Salkever’s work on tragedy as civic education is to show how the tragedies that Aristotle admired most gained much of their rhetorical effectiveness by speaking to the popular piety and attachment to democratic ideals that characterized the Athenian <italic>dēmos</italic>.</p>
         <p>The strategy of stimulating interrogation of existing regimes by enacting discoveries of the tyrannical natures of regimes on stage could be particularly effective in democratic Athens. This is because the Athenian <italic>dēmos</italic>, although potentially susceptible to the charms of tyranny, could also be shocked by its unabashed and lawless irreverence toward all of the objects of popular piety. Piety is politically significant because it imposes an obligation of lawfulness that is above, beyond, and prior to the claims of the powerful to make and enforce the laws. While, as a philosopher dedicated to unrestrained inquiry, Aristotle shared tyranny’s irreverence toward the objects of the popular piety, he could unreservedly endorse modes of communication that spoke discretely and respectfully to that piety. We can see this in Aristotle’s delicate treatment of conventional respect for obligations to fathers. On the one hand, he treated conventional respect for fathers with deference (<italic>NE</italic> 1103a1–3, 1134b8–16, 1135a23–b2, 1158b21–28, 1160a3–7, 1161a10–22, 1163b15–28, <italic>Pol.</italic> 1259b10–14). Reading these passages, one can hardly mistake him for a parricidal tyrant, or even a figuratively parricidal philosopher like <italic>The Republic’</italic>s Socrates. However, by subtly raising the question of the limits placed on obligations to fathers by conflicting considerations (<italic>NE</italic> 1148a22–b4, 1160b22–32, 1165a14–18, 1164b22–1165a16 1165a21–27), he leads his students beyond convention. Aristotle sees the tyrant as a man impelled to violate the constraints of popular piety by his insatiable graspingness (<italic>NE</italic> 1160b1–12, <italic>Pol.</italic> 1311a2–4). But unlike the builder of the city in speech, Aristotle turns his attention to the improvement, even the preservation of the flawed regimes passed on by the fathers (1288b21–33, Book V), and counsels caution in proposing new laws (1269a14–24). Because he eschews iconoclasm, he can, in good faith, speak to the popular piety of his day, and, treating it with a measure of seriousness, call attention to its internal inconsistencies and its tensions with other values. Of course, this is not to deny that Aristotle’s pious regard for the truth (<italic>NE</italic> 1096a11–17) was altogether distinct from popular piety. It is merely to say that, because of his concern for the city, he was solicitous of the conventional beliefs that made the city possible, and at the same time made use of puzzles posed by inconsistencies among those beliefs and between them and other concerns. In this way, he fleshed out and applied his own very compressed recommendation that one should take account of the beliefs and values of those one is trying to persuade (Aristotle ([1898] 2010, 1984b,1365b22–26; hereafter <italic>Rhet.</italic>).</p>
         <p>Moreover, the attachment of the Athenian citizenry to democracy was not unrelated to an important element of Athenian popular piety, the cult of Dionysos. The god was identified with the <italic>polis</italic> and specifically with the triumph of the lawful and democratic <italic>polis</italic> over lawless aristocratic clans (Seaford 1994, 345, 367). Among the indications of the connection of this god with the democratic <italic>polis</italic> are some of his names. One of his names was <italic>Dionysos Eleuthereus</italic>, said to be taken from the name of the town from which he came to Athens, but also strongly related to the Greek word for a central democratic value, <italic>eleutheria</italic>, or freedom (367). Another of his names was <italic>Lysios</italic>, meaning liberator (Cartledge 1997, 23). The role of Dionysos as god of the democratic <italic>polis</italic> is of special significance to the study of tragedy as antityrannic civic education because tragedy originated as a major element in the cult of Dionysos and never lost its identification with that cult (Seaford 1994, 4). Therefore, tragedy was an aspect of Athenian popular piety that was intrinsically democratic (364, 369–70). In addition to his identification with democracy and civic solidarity, Dionysos was also the embodiment of new appearances and new perspectives, which may explain his association with the theater (Cartledge 1997, 8). Consequently, we can see that one aspect of his cult was a disposition to perceive established hierarchies and social practices in new ways and from a democratic, <italic>polis</italic>-supportive, and hence, antityrannical perspective.</p>
         <p>The plots of many tragedies reinforced the connection with democracy. Typically, they were accounts of the errors of characters identified as tyrants whose inward-looking clans were destroyed by cycles of violence (Seaford 1994, 345). These cycles could only be terminated by the establishment of a civic cult, which replaced reciprocal exchanges among autonomous clans with a more impersonal form of justice through the law of the <italic>polis</italic> (198–99, 360). Aristotle held that extreme democracy, one of the components of tyranny,               <sup>6</sup>
             is also characterized by lawlessness (<italic>Pol.</italic> 1292a4–37), that “wherever the laws are not authoritative (<italic>kurioi</italic>), in that place demagogues come into being” (1292a10–11) and that “such a [lawless] <italic>dēmos</italic> is equivalent to (<italic>analogon</italic>) a tyrannical monarchy, since its character (<italic>ēthos</italic>) is the same” (1292a17–19). Therefore, the law-validating plots of these tragedies, no less than their identification with the god of the lawful, democratic <italic>polis</italic> made them an instrument waiting to be honed by a political philosopher opposed the degeneration of a democratic regime into lawless tyranny.</p>
         <p>The antityrannical, democratic, and zetetic influence of Athenian popular piety went beyond the cult of Dionysos to extend to the more general religious context of tragedy. Unlike the monotheistic popular piety of contemporary Western democracies, Athenian popular religion presented the pious with a mélange of conflicting obligations.               <sup>7</sup>
             This mélange was often enacted in the tragedies, confronting the spectators with <italic>aporiai</italic> and leading them to more complete understandings of their regime and a more critical perspective on the habits it had instilled in them. <italic>Antigone,</italic> in which obligation to <italic>oikos</italic> is set against obligation to <italic>polis</italic> is the most well-known but far from the only example. Sophocles’s <italic>Ajax</italic>, in which the pursuit of honor is set against both piety               <sup>8</sup>
             and the good of the larger community, is another.</p>
         <p>In his painstaking investigation of the relationship of Athenian popular religion to the tragedies performed in classical Athens, Mikalson identifies five distinct influences on Greek tragedy:<disp-quote>
               <p>(1) the anthropomorphic deities of the Homeric pantheon; (2) beliefs and deities once part of popular religion but in the classical period virtually extinct; (3) deities, beliefs, practices, and cults of contemporary fifth-century society; (4) a concern with the morality and justice of the gods; and, finally, (5) contemporary or recent philosophical conceptions of deity. (1991, ix)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The third influence is of greatest interest with regard to the civic education of the <italic>dēmos</italic> because it is by speaking directly to and about the beliefs, practices, and cults of its audience that tragedy takes hold of that audience with sufficient force to move it to question the presuppositions of the regime. Through equally painstaking study, based primarily on an analysis of oratory, Mikalson has specified the major components of the crucial third influence on Greek tragedy, popular piety:<disp-quote>
               <p>belief in and reverence for the gods of the city, maintenance of oaths, respect for the rights of asylum and hospitality, observance of tradition and law in cult sacrifices and tendance of the dead, loyalty to one’s country, and proper care of one’s living parents. (1991, 5)                     <sup>9</sup>
                  
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>According to Mikalson, these obligations were universally recognized by both the characters in tragedy and by the audience. In addition to the obligations enumerated by Mikalson, we can identify some others that fourth-century Athenians took very seriously. From the emphasis that Aristotle places on friendship (<italic>philia</italic>) in his ethical and political works and from myths such as the story of Damon and Pythias, we can infer that the Greeks also held friendship in very high, perhaps even pious regard. Another driver of action in classical Athens was the pursuit of honor. Its ultimate end was the achievement of immortality through posthumous cult (Arendt 1969, 18–19; Seaford 1994, 288). What is significant from the standpoint of an education that challenges popular opinion is that these obligations can and do come into conflict with each other. In fact, it has been argued that the difficulty of resolving conflicts among obligations of conventional piety and between them and the obligations to friends and the pursuit of honor without doing violence to one’s integrity and place in the world is the essential teaching of tragedy (Nussbaum 2001, chaps. 2, 3). Like the teaching of the Platonic Socrates, and like Aristotle’s teaching in <italic>The Politics</italic> and <italic>The Nicomachean Ethics</italic>, it is a teaching that proceeds by leading the learner to an <italic>aporia</italic>. As such, tragedy necessarily has the potential to move its audience toward a critical distance from popular opinions, including those that render it susceptible to certain charms of tyranny, such as its use of violence against foreigners and its promise to protect the <italic>dēmos</italic> from threats to life and comfort.</p>

         <title>Excellence in the Composition of Tragedy</title>
         <p>Largely because of its religious and, more specifically, Dionysian origins and undertones, tragedy had the power to stir the emotions, riveting the attention of the <italic>dēmos</italic> on the questions that it raised. Following Golden (1976), I am convinced that this stirring of the emotions for the purpose of reaching a clarified understanding of the problems of human beings living in a city is what Aristotle means by <italic>katharsis</italic> in <italic>The Poetics</italic> (Aristotle [1966] 2010, [1954] 1984c, 1449b28; hereafter <italic>Poe.</italic>). The <italic>katharsis</italic> of <italic>The Poetics</italic> is not the same as the <italic>katharsis</italic> of <italic>The Politics</italic> 1341a. In the former, pity and fear are for the sake of discovery (<italic>anagnōrisis</italic>), an uncovering of something originally hidden from the protagonist (<italic>Poe.</italic> 1452a36–b8). The process is essentially a cognitive one, not a purgation of the emotions. The discoveries that Aristotle cites as examples are the discoveries in <italic>Oedipus the Tyrant</italic> and <italic>Iphigenia among the Taurians</italic>, in which persons whom the title character took to be strangers were actually members of his or her own household. As a result, the distancing of persons from one another on which tyranny depends (<italic>Pol.</italic> 1313b4–6, 16–17, 1314a17–19) was overcome. In what follows, I will offer a reading of <italic>The Poetics</italic> which brings out Aristotle’s interest employing <italic>katharsis</italic> to encourage inquiry into the nature of the regime and the habits it instills. Then I will discuss the two plays that Aristotle considered to be exemplary because the discoveries by the protagonists were “among the probable things” (<italic>eikotōn</italic>), given the occurrence of the acts leading up to them (<italic>Poe.</italic>1455a16–18), that is to say the discoveries made by the protagonists were surprising to the protagonists and yet were actually likely given the beliefs and habits prevailing in the tyrannical regimes in which the protagonists lived.</p>
         <p>I will begin my reading of <italic>The Poetics</italic> by treating the content that Aristotle advocates, proceed to a discussion of the stylistic and formal elements that he supports, and conclude with comments on the two plays that he considers exemplary. Throughout the discussion, I will speculate as to the likely effects of the recommended content, style, and paradigmatic plays on Athenian spectators. I will offer a reading of <italic>The Poetics</italic> as an extension of <italic>The Art of Rhetoric</italic> as well as an extension of Aristotle’s more overtly ethical and political lectures.</p>
         <p>Aristotle recommends that tragedy depict action (<italic>Poe.</italic>1449b24, 1450a15–19) and that the action take an unexpected turn for the worse or bear an unpleasant surprise that is intrinsic to the depicted action (1450a33–35, 1452a18–b3). Inherent in the unpleasant surprise is the revelation that acts previously believed to be unrelated are causally linked (1452a3–7), that the actual or narrowly averted catastrophes are, in fact, consequences of tyranny. He holds that the main character should be</p>
         <p>            
            <disp-quote>
               <p>such a man as one who is not of surpassing excellence and justice nor one who is thrown into misfortune through badness and wickedness (<italic>mochthēria</italic>) but rather one [who is thrown into misfortune] through some error (<italic>hamartia</italic>). (1453a7–10)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>It is significant that both the examples he gives of such men in <italic>The Poetics</italic> (1453a11) were flawed monarchs. One is Thyestes, who is not a major character in any surviving play predating Aristotle. The other is Oedipus the tyrant. It is evident that despite the very negative way he portrays tyranny in <italic>The Politics</italic>, Aristotle does not consider a tyrant or tyranny to be wicked, but rather, mistaken. Vernant explains the distinction between <italic>hamartia</italic> of the sort that Oedipus made and wickedness on the basis of intentionality:<disp-quote>
               <p>How could one of one’s own volition be misled by error? And once it has been committed how could the <italic>hamartia</italic> possibly not carry its punishment within itself, quite independent of the intentions of the subject?” (1988, 63)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>This means that tyranny and its negative consequences can be prevented through the essentially cognitive process of clarification (<italic>katharsis</italic>).</p>
         <p>It is also significant that Aristotle says that the protagonist of tragedy should be “among those held in great honor and of good fortune” (<italic>Poe.</italic> 1453a10), in other words, “the kind of human being [that] may rule the society in question in broad daylight” as Strauss puts it (1978, 34). The depiction of such a person’s words or actions in certain types of circumstances should be generalizable (1451b6–10). When a discovery is made that the operating assumptions of such a person are erroneous, the conventional opinions and hierarchies of the regime itself are called into question. As Jones notes, the fact that the actors wore masks strongly suggests that the characters were of interest because they typified social roles, not because they portrayed unique individuals (1962, 43–45). Witnessing the action should induce <italic>katharsis</italic> in the audience through pity and fear (1449b27–28). Taken together, the elements of tragedy that Aristotle advocates would confront the residents of the <italic>polis</italic> with the possibility that actions that are likely within the context of one’s regime are not what they seem to be, that those actions may rest on false assumptions based on erroneous conventional opinions that result in actual or narrowly averted suffering. This possibility is brought home to the audience with considerable emotional force. These insights cause well-brought-up members of the audience to recognize that conventional institutions, hierarchies, beliefs, and habits may be problematic. But these insights also raise the possibility that through “discovery,” error can be overcome. In other words, tragedy presupposes the possibility of a correct understanding of human action, based on knowledge of its true purpose, that can improve the quality of human life. The search for that understanding can be characterized as a teleological science of human action. But the lesson of tragedy must always conclude with more questions rather than with the neat tied-up endings that appeal to the “weakness” (<italic>astheneia</italic>) of the audiences (1453a30–39). Aristotle’s teleological science of human action assumes that a correct understanding of human action is discoverable in principle, but it does not settle for facile conclusions that appeal to our weakness.</p>
         <p>Aristotle has recommendations about the way the message should be conveyed as well as its content. He recommends that the playwright use language that is pleasantly unusual (1449b25) in order to help audiences perceive in a new way. He says that the poet should have a talent for metaphor, a talent that cannot be taught because it consists in finding connections that escape the notice of those who see in conventional ways (1459a5–8). Such metaphors would have the effect of breaking audiences out of old patterns of perception. To that end, he says that the playwright should have a special gift for empathy and even a touch of madness (1455a30–34). Taken together, these recommendations amount to a contention that, like the philosopher, the playwright should occupy a vantage point that is beyond the <italic>polis</italic> walls.               <sup>10</sup>
             But Aristotle does not recommend that tragedy be itself a form of propaganda. Rather than having the playwright narrate the action and tell the audience what to think of it, Aristotle would have the characters speak for themselves (1449b26–27) and let the audience interpret the significance of the plot without the intervention of a narrator telling them what to make of it. Members of the audience are coproducers of the intended effect, the questioning of some aspects of conventional opinion.</p>

         <title>The Exemplary Plays</title>
         <p>Aristotle holds up as exemplary those particular tragic plays which tell the story of the terrible costs of living under a form of rule that is not what it seems to be, and of the possibilities of coming to know that form of rule for what it is and constituting a better way of life through a process of extended questioning. In both <italic>Iphigenia among the Taurians</italic> (Euripides 1913, 1938) and <italic>Oedipus The Tyrant</italic> (Sophocles 1887, 1887),               <sup>11</sup>
             the action has life-changing consequences for the main character and for other people in the play as well.               <sup>12</sup>
             Part of the impact of the action in tragedy is derived from the fact that it generally involves people who personify the <italic>polis</italic>. Oedipus is the much-admired ruler of Thebes. Iphigenia is a respected official involved in the ritual murders of guests/ foreigners (<italic>xenoi</italic>) unlucky enough to find themselves in Tauris.</p>
         <p>She stands for all of those who make tyranny possible by committing thoughtless acts of violence at the behest of a barbarous, obscurantist regime. In fact, through most of the play, neither Iphigenia nor any of other residents of Tauris, including the captive women of the chorus, refer to Thoas as <italic>turannos</italic> (tyrant). They, the native shepherds, and Thoas’s messenger refer to him as “<italic>anax</italic>” (lord), <italic>despotēs</italic> (master), <italic>koiranos</italic> (lord, ruler), or <italic>kratountos</italic> (the strong one; 333, 1285, 1294, 1080, 1301, 1303, 1421).               <sup>13</sup>
             In addressing him, even Athena calls this god-fearing ruler “<italic>anax</italic>” (1435). Initially, only Orestes, the Hellene from Mycenae, recognizes Tauris as barbarous (739) and its <italic>xenoi-</italic> murdering ruler as a <italic>turannos</italic> (741, 1020), a term of opprobrium in fourth- and fifth-century democratic Athens. But by the end of the play, Iphigenia has come to see the land of Tauris as barbarous (1400). Given the audience’s pious acceptance of obligations to guests and foreigners, Orestes’s application of the terms “barbarian” and “tyrant” to Thoas, king of the Taurians, would have been credible. Tauris is the paradigmatic barbarous tyranny, in which neither ruler nor ruled are aware of the impieties they are committing. Instead of the complex and <italic>aporia-</italic>inducing mélange of obligations that life in the <italic>polis</italic> presents, there is only unequivocal command of a bloodthirsty goddess. But in a remarkable soliloquy, the Hellene Iphigenia begins to cast doubt on the rightness of human sacrifice.</p>
         <p>            
            <disp-quote>
               <p>It cannot be that Leto the wife of Zeus gave birth to such ignorance (<italic>amathian</italic>) [as human sacrifice]. I judge that [the account of] the banquet of Tantalus for the gods at which they enjoyed eating the flesh of the child is unbelievable. I am of the opinion that the people here, who are themselves murderous, attribute their evil to the goddess. For I believe that no deity is evil. (385–91)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Despite the absence of supporting evidence (Kyriakou 2006, 14), Iphigenia has claimed that the goddess cannot be bloodthirsty. The implication of Iphigenia’s claim is that there is a true, universal morality that is not defined by the gods as presented by the ruler of the city. It is indeed remarkable that such a message should be presented to a mass audience at a religious festival sponsored by the rulers of the city.</p>
         <p>Despite her misgivings, at the time that she gives this speech, Iphigenia is preparing to preside over the murder of Orestes and his friend Pulades. Kyriakou characterizes her at this point as confused. But Kyriakou points out that Iphigenia is also conventionally noble, as indicated by her sympathy for the <italic>xenoi</italic>, her longing for her family, and her refusal to murder Thoas because of her obligation to him as her host (2006, 10–11 referring to lines 1021, 1023). She embodies that dynamic mix of frank confusion, desire for clarity, and conventional nobility that fuels penetrating inquiry into the nature of the regime.</p>
         <p>It is not only Iphigenia’s initial understanding of what she is doing that proves to be faulty. Orestes’s initial acceptance of conventional opinion about the noble temporarily obscures the truth and comes close to resulting in his unnecessary death (483–502). But other dimensions of his conventionalism, fealty to oath, and love of his household contribute to the extended interrogative dialogue that results in the discovery of the truth, and, it is fair to say, a reconsideration of the understanding of the noble with which he had been imbued. Iphigenia’s respect for Pulades’s oath also comes into conflict with her duty to Artemis (755–65), and it also makes an essential contribution to the discovery that results in the salvation of Orestes and Pulades and the escape of all three to the <italic>polis</italic> according to prayer. As the play opens, we see Iphigenia as an agent of the impious barbarous tyranny of Tauris, just beginning to question the impious commands of the goddess. At the play’s conclusion, she is a citizen capable of criticizing the practices of the Taurians. She, her brother, and his friend are now possessed of greater knowledge. They leave a land marked by the mindless violence of barbarous tyranny for a <italic>polis</italic> that recognizes the irreducible plurality of obligations at the core of democratic citizenship. Even Thoas, having been instructed by Athena, willingly abandons the pursuit of the three friends (375–86), indicating that, in at least some cases, tyranny is essentially a cognitive error, not a deliberate choice to do evil.</p>
         <p>As civic education for citizens of a democracy, it is significant that the tragedy begins with the theocratic tyranny of Thoas having universal popular support. Even Iphigenia and the captive women of the chorus are prepared to comply with it. Nor at any point in the play did the people of Tauris question the xenophobic tyranny of Thoas or the cult of the bloodthirsty goddess Artemis. This was a tyranny that is accepted by the ruled because they did not think for themselves. To summarize, the play focuses the attention of the audience on the some of the most appalling features of what Aristotle calls barbarous tyranny, its xenophobia, its mindless violence, and absence of true human action as the culmination of deliberation and choice on the part of the ruled.</p>
         <p>            
            <italic>Oedipus the Tyrant</italic> is also a play about a ruler who begins with universal popular support.               <sup>14</sup>
             The people of Thebes are happy to be ruled by a tyrant who demonstrated that he could protect them when he defeated the Sphinx. Their preference for security over ruling and being ruled in turn has resulted in their infantilization (1, 6, 32, and see Saxonhouse 1988, 1267).               <sup>15</sup>
             But unlike the ignorant people of Tauris, the people of Thebes have traded the uncertainties attendant to ruling and being ruled in turn for the apparent security of mere life provided by a competent problem solver.               <sup>16</sup>
             This is the species of tyranny that Aristotle characterizes as “Persian.” As Saxonhouse notes, Oedipus is a paradigm of hyperrationalism in politics. His arrogance (<italic>hubris</italic>) consists in believing that he is not tethered by his particular history and biology (1988, 1261, 1263). He believes that differences can be reduced to commonalities through rational analysis (1267–68). Long before his <italic>hamartiai</italic> are discovered, he is described by the chorus as bestial, homeless, hearthless, and friendless (476–80), a characterization reiterated by Aristotle in his citation of Homer’s citiless man as “clanless, lawless, hearthless” (<italic>Pol.</italic> 1253a5).               <sup>17</sup>
             Oedipus makes the technocratic tyrant’s error of confusing political success and ability with what is right (381, 397–98). Like the people of Thebes, he holds nothing in higher regard than political power and what it can accomplish. Discovery of the truth cannot be countenanced by the conventional opinion of the rightness of the <italic>regime.</italic> This incompatibility is dramatized by Oedipus’s blinding of himself.</p>
         <p>But, like Iphigenia, Oedipus is a multidimensional character. As tyrant, he threatens Tereisias (368) and exhibits the paranoia typical of his ilk when he accuses Creon of conspiring against him (380–89). But he is also a riddle solver, and when riddle solving comes to require self-discovery, he continues to seek the answer. This begins the process of learning, suffering, and ultimately reformation, which culminates in the following play of the trilogy, <italic>Oedipus at Colonus.</italic> Solving the riddle requires the contributions of the ruled (984–1182), who are now no longer suppliant children, but citizens.</p>
         <p>With these plays, the audience is led to discover, along with the characters in the plays, that the regime and the habits it instills are not what they seem to be. In <italic>Iphigenia among the Taurians</italic>, spectators are induced to question their willingness to thoughtlessly kill <italic>xenoi</italic> at the behest of an obscurantist theocracy. In the case of <italic>Oedipus the Tyrant</italic>, the audience is confronted with the dark side of political authority, its lack of self-knowledge, and the willingness of the citizens to assume that those who have displayed competence in protecting their lives are without <italic>hamartia</italic>. In both plays, extended questioning enables characters to break through the cognitive constraints of their individual vantage points to a socially constructed,               <sup>18</sup>
             and more complete, perception of their actions and their regime. In so doing, inquiry provides the way out of tyranny.</p>

         <title>Obstacles to Civic Education in Western Liberal Democracies</title>
         <p>            
            <bold>A</bold>ristotle had considerable resources at his disposal for addressing the <italic>aporiai</italic> of an upbringing that must enculturate the young but also encourage penetrating inquiry into the presuppositions of the community. The resources available to us are more circumscribed. This is at least partly because the popular piety in the Western democracies is primarily monotheistic piety. At the core of that piety is a God that is emphatically singular and unchanging. In that key respect, contemporary popular piety in the West is radically different from the popular piety of ancient Greece. The latter was in every way a regard for diverse and incommensurable human things, from its squabbling anthropomorphic deities to its myths of divine foundings of the cities, its burial rituals, its obligations to oaths, parents, guests, hosts, and foreigners, and the complete the absence of an ethic of asceticism from it.               <sup>19</sup>
             Precisely because the piety of the ancient Greeks was a mélange of potentially incompatible human concerns, it could be directed toward an inquiry into human action from a human perspective. The diversity and incommensurability of the things it valued made its perspective inherently political and resistant to the radical reduction of perspectives and obligations. For this reason, representations of human action informed by the popular piety of Greeks could be political in the final analysis in a way that analogous representations of human action in monotheistic states can only be by becoming secular or by recognizing a radical discontinuity between revealed knowledge and practical political judgment.               <sup>20</sup>
             In addition to establishing the political quality of representations of human action, Greek popular piety endowed those representations with the aura of the sacred, providing them with a measure of resistance to the demands of the marketplace that is rarely available to mass communications, especially to secular mass communications, in the modern age. For a closer analysis of the challenges facing civic education through imitations of action in the liberal democracies of the West, we turn to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
         <p>His <italic>Letter to d’Alembert</italic> is notable in two respects. It is both a trenchant critique of modern theater and its successors in the field of popular entertainment and an example of the modern view of civic education. Rousseau opposes the introduction of a theater to Geneva on the grounds that it could only be a bad influence on the moral and civic character of its citizens ([1758] 1948; [1758] 1968, 38–39 [38–40], 46–47 [51–53]).               <sup>21</sup>
             Unmoored from a pious regard for civic and ethical obligations, the theater can only have a negative effect on the civic virtue and moral character of the relatively virtuous citizens of the small city of Geneva.               <sup>22</sup>
             Rousseau, however, held that Greek theater, although similar to the theater of his day in that it was constrained to stir the most widespread and accessible of the passions, never sank to the level of irresponsibility reached by the theater of his own day. He believed that by retaining its character as a civic and religious liturgy, the theater of ancient Greece was somewhat insulated from the need to pander to the basest desires of the many in order to satisfy the appetites of the marketplace (23–24 [17–19], 44 [48], 104 [141]). Nevertheless, Rousseau held that not even the Greek theater could provide a good civic and moral education (105 [142])<italic>.</italic> His pessimism stems from two beliefs that mark Rousseau as very much a man of the Enlightenment. The first belief is that the arousal of the passions blocks learning, reason, and moderation (26 [22]).               <sup>23</sup>
             The second is that creating “disturbance” (<italic>le trouble</italic>) in the minds of the citizens by raising unsettling questions is incompatible with the moral and civic education of those citizens (27 [23]). Aristotle is opposed to Rousseau on both counts. Whereas Rousseau holds that the arousal of pity and fear obstructs learning (26 [22], 30 [27–28]), Aristotle holds that, on the contrary, it focuses attention, opens the mind to new ways of perceiving and impresses what is learned upon the soul of the learner. It is clear that even if a popular piety capable of both grabbing the attention of the citizenry and presenting it with the irresolvable conflicts among obligations that a moderate citizenry must appreciate, Rousseau would not speak to it. By portraying “disturbance” of beliefs as purely destructive, Rousseau reveals the dark interior of the Enlightenment and his residence within it. In his very “enlightened” rejection of “disturbance,” Rousseau covertly imports monotheism’s negation of the incommensurability of things that are genuinely good into the zone of matters about which human beings must deliberate. In the Western democracies of the modern world, it is the secular heirs to the Enlightenment, no less than those who explicitly advocate applying the monotheistic norms of consistency, commensurability, and permanence to political life, who render a civic education that interrogates prevailing habits of action and thought difficult to provide.</p>
         <p>The demise of a teleological science of human things has also made civic education more difficult. For without the combination of a conviction that there is a highest human end that is potentially knowable and attainable and a refusal to settle for facile reconciliation of apparently conflicting values, civic education is diverted to a fork in the road where both paths lead to a dead end. One path leads to the generalizable, but at the cost of a mendacious superficiality, resulting in simplistic and unequivocal celebrations or, less commonly, excoriations of regimes. This path is generally distinguished by a simplistic hagiography of the founders of the state and the elevation of patriotism above all other virtues. The other path is faithful to the irreducible diversity of human goods. But without the conviction that contradictions among these goods are potentially resolvable, this path leads to an abandonment of serious inquiry. This path produces citizens whose only response to criticism of the regime is that “everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.” The conditions for a zetetic, antityrannical form of civic education for the many that balances enculturation with an examination of regime-instilled habits and assumptions are less than ideal. But, in the spirit of Aristotle’s <italic>Politics</italic>, we can begin to improve our regimes through clarification of our goals and recognition of our constraints and opportunities for providing such a balanced civic education for the citizenry.</p>
