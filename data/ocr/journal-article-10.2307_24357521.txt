Rappel: THE EXPOSITORY ASPECT OF THE GRAMMATICAL DEVIATION FROM THE ORIGINAL INTARGUM ONQELOS(pp 85-96) Some of the grammatical deviations of Targum OnqSlos from the original text of the Pentateuch are caused by the fact that Biblical Hebrew is not always in accordance with the normative grammar of Biblical Hebrew. Some are brought about by the peculiarities of Aramaic grammar as against the Hebrew. Yet other deviations - the subject of the present paper — come about by the translators intention to clarify some difficult expressions. This paper deals With the following phenomena, impersonal verbs translated as personal verbs, gender changes, substitutions of plural forms for singular ones and vice versa. Translation of tenses is an especially thorny problem, because of the peculiarities of the Biblical Hebrew tense system. Further problems involving verbal forms are the distinction between contmuous and perfect forms, different kinds of modalities and moods. Finally, the paper discusses the translation of the construct state and the replacing of negations and interrogative forms by affirmations. s. Kogut, THE EXTRA PRONOMINAL ELEMENT IN THE BIBLE (pp 9-26,97-123) In Biblical Hebrew an extra pronominal element can be distinguished in three different circumstances, the postposited pronoun (referring to a previously mentioned noun), the proleptic pronoun (referring to a noun as yet unmentioned) and the doubled pronoun. This paper describes, classifies and illustrates these pleonastic circumstances, so problematic to early grammarians and to their more modern counterparts, while critically analysing the commentaries and translations relating to the large number of illustrative verses amassed. In this abstract only the major classifications have been adduced (with a very few textual references brought in parentheses). The Postposited Pronoun: Besides common cases of the extraposition of a syntactical unit requiring a pronominal element referring back to It further along in the sentence (Gen. iv 26), there are cases of a postposited detached pronoun immediately following the noun to which It refers (Lev. xvii 11 أ Num. XVIII 23;Eccl</page><page sequence="2">IX 4) The phrase בלילה הוא (Gen XIX 33 et al٠) IS discussed specifically, and compared with the Mishnaic בו בלילה and with the Aramaic כה זמנא and בה בליליא, respectively. There are also cases of postposited attached pronominal elements (Ex XVI 4) The Proleptic Pronoun• The view denying the use of proleptic pronouns before the development of Mishnaic Hebrew IS responsible for verses containing such pronouns not having been identified earlier, or having been considered defective and, consequently, "corrected". The examples adduced and analysed suffice to show that this usage was quite common in Biblical Hebrew, thus rendering the "corrections" unjustified. The proleptic pronoun appears m the mam as an object pronoun attached to a verb (Ex. 11 6, Ez. Ill 21); It is occasionally attached to an infinitive (Jer. XXXI 1, Ez. xliv 7). It IS sometimes separated from the noun It refers to (2 Sam XIV 6; 1 Kings XXI 13), and on other occasions It precedes Its noun which follows an accusative lamed{ 1 Chron. V 26; 2 Chron. XXV 10). The pronominal element may be attached to יש (Est. Ill 8) or to איה (Isa XIX 12) When attached to a preposition, this preposition may appear before the pronominal element only (Cant. 11 16) or It may be repeated before the noun referred to, as well (Jos 1 2) When the proleptic pronoun IS detached, It may appear immediately before the noun It refers to (Ex. XII 42) or at some distance from It (Ez XI 15) A demonstrative pronoun may also be proleptic (Ex XXXII 1, Ps. CIV 25). A proleptic pronominal element may be attached to a construct noun in a case of a split genitive construction (Cant. Ill 7) or It may replace a genitive construction (Gen. XIV 12), sometimes with an added lamed (Num 1 21) The Doubled Pronoun: When two pronouns appear the second IS actually a postposited one, while the first IS a proleptic one. These are the possible arrangements• (a) an attached pronominal element followed by a detached pronoun — in this case the first one may be attached to a verb (Gen. XXX 20) to a noun (Prov XXIII 15), to a preposition (2 Chron. XXXV 21); or to the word הנה (Num XI 14). (b) a detached pronoun followed by an attached one — the detached pronoun may appear as part of a preposited phrase (Isa. xlv 12); the attached pronominal element may be attached to the word לבד (Num. XI 14)• the detached pronoun may serve as an object pronoun if the following attached pronominal element IS Itself an object pronoun (Eccl.ii 15). (c) two detached pronouns (Gen XX 5), which may even be detached object pronouns (Gen. xh 10). (d) two attached pronominal elements (Cant. 1 6; 2 Sam. XXII 2). A very special case is the appearance of a double pronominal element attached to prepositions (Gen. XXIX 28) Y. Sabar: LOYALTY AND DEVIATION IN THE JEWISH NEO-ARAMAIC TRANSLATIONSOFTHEBIBLE(pp 124-140) Traditional oral translations of the Bible in Jewish Neo-Aramaic, as in other</page><page sequence="3">Jewish languages, are, as a rule, quite literal, so much so, that even Hebrew grammatical words with no parallel in the spoken language are artificially translated by inventing a cognate otherwise unknown m the everyday use of the language. As a result, the language of the translation is, as a whole, quite artificial and at tunes even meaningless, especially if one does not know the original Hebrew words underlying it. However, many instances show deviation from this principle for various reasons, such as: 1) Simple misunderstanding of the original Hebrew text (its meaning or grammatical structure, e.g., reading the passive voice as a form of the active voice, confusing a word With another of similar sound but different meaning); 2) Translation based on traditional homiletic commentary (Midras), especially when the Hebrew text is obscure; 3) Deviation due to euphemism, e.g., avoiding anthropomorphism or plurality in relation to God; 4) Translation reflecting local and contemporary realia, especially regarding local and ethnic names, e g., "Armenian" for "Aramean", "Baghdad" for "Babylon", "Kurdistan" for "Ararat". M.Rottenberg: 'ءسمم AND _^rASPR0N0UNS0 141-142) Modern Hebrew employs the four words אותם ,אותה ,אותו and אותן as Pronouns of Identity, with a meaning similar to that of the English same, as, for instance.אותן בנות, שביקרו שם אתמול, שבו לשם גם היום (The same girls who visited there yesterday returned there today as well). Mishnaic Hebrew uses the same four words in the same way: e.g.,ובאו אחיהם שלא מאותה האם (Their brothers — not of the same mother — arrived) — Yevamoth 99a. The twenty four books of the Bible, on the other hand, despite the masses of narrative material they encompass, do not use these words in this fashion. It IS my opinion that the words אחת ,אחד and their plural forms serve occasionally m the Bible as Pronouns of Identity, e.g., the expression lev 'ehad (Ez.15, 19) as well as the phrases midda *ahat, huqqa *ahatI mispat 'ehait miqre *ehad etc This interpretation of the words אחת ,אחד and their plurals enables the verse ויהי כל הארץ שפה אחת ודברים אחדים (Gen 11,1) to be suitably understood: all the inhabitants of the earth had the same language and the same artifacts. Now people living in different places generally use different artifacts, depending on the physical conditions prevalent in their area — heavier clothing, for example, in cold climates — but this does not apply to the period discussed in this verse; all men were concentrated in one spot, and not only spoke the same language, but also used the same artifacts, as a result of their being concentrated in a single area. I.Ben-David, ،4'IN VERBAL SUBSTANTIVES (pp.49ا-43ل) The verbal substantives of the nifaltpVel and م/formations m Hebrew, and</page><page sequence="4">the pa*el, hafel, afel and hitpe'ei formations m Biblical Aramaic all have a feature m common — the vowel a which does not change under any circumstances. hippa'alut, pa'dla, hafala, afaia, hitpe'ala٠ This rule is sometimes Ignored. Most prayer-books read ألا ןחןןוןא the Qaddih prayer, but the plural of ןח؟؟א IS, of course, ؛חן؛ן؟א. All dictionaries carry ؟י؟וןא, and in the prayer-books one also finds סיעתא (meaning "assitance"). Dalman's dictionary has ٢١٢٠٠א, but the correct form IS סיעתא Similarly סכנתא, and not סכנתא as one finds m the dictionaries Most errors of this kind occur in the אפעלתא pattern, the common vocalization being אפעלתא as אגדתא (and not אפ?؛עתא ,(אגדתא ,אגדתא (and not אפקעתא) In פ"ו nouns the correct reading IS א1ןיתא ,א1ן_ ,א1ןיתא (not ,א1ניוןא,א1די؟א א1כיתא) And a scholar IS י5ר א1ןץן not 5ר אורין which IS the common vocalization Finally, the name of the dividing accent should be אתנחתא, not אתנחתא. REVIEW (pp 150-152) J.Blau E.Y. Kutscher, A History of The Hebrew Language, edited by R Kutscher The Magnes Press, the Hebrew University, Jerusalem EJ Bnh Leiden 1982, pp. XXX, 306. This comprehensive history of the Hebrew language, written by the late E Y Kutscher between the years 1964 and 1968 and edited by his son IS admirably suited to the needs of any college offering a course in the history of Hebrew Kutschefs expertness and erudition in almost every field of Hebrew linguistics enabled him to write an excellent textbook. In the Hebrew review some amendments for a possible Hebrew version of this book are suggested. REVIEW (pp 153-157) J.Blau: Jewish Language Review, published by the Association for the Study of Jewish Languages and devoted to all aspects of the inner and outer linguistic history of the Jewish people and related groups, University of Haifa, Co-editors D.L. Gold, L Prager, 1 (1981); 208 type written pages (big quarto). This new journal is devoted to Jewish interlinguistics (or, as the editors meticulously demand, intralinguistics). One wonders why a journal dealing With Jewish languages and edited in Israel, should be written in English. Moreover, the pleasure one could derive from reading it is marred by the blind adherence of the editors (especially of D.L. Gold) to a certain theory, thus putting the Jewish languages into the Procrustean bed of preconceived views formed in the light of the history of Yiddish, without taking the facts of individual cases into proper consideration. This is demonstrated mainly by Gold's treatment of JudeoArabic</page></plain_text>
