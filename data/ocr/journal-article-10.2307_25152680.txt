L. Fabri and K. de B. Codrington2 for their articles dealing with the Mathura School of sculpture, captures very appropriately the mood of this important and unusual art center. Indeed, it would be difficult to find another place in India which displays greater religious diversity and variety of subject matter in sculpture than is the case with Mathura. The span of time during which the school actively flourished (almost ten cen turies) would be impossible for any other center to match. The sculpture it produced represents an indigenous trend, as opposed to its contemporary Western-influenced Gandharan style. Moreover it provided a model upon which all the later schools of sculpture in India were based. The city of Mathura is situated in the present day Uttar Pradesh on the banks of the Yamuna River (a Ganges tribu tary), about fifty miles south of Delhi. Because of its favorable geographic position on the ancient trade routes3 Mathura gained importance at an early date. The oldest sculptures excavated in the area predate Sunga times (second century BC). It continued as an active center contemporaneously with Bharhut and Sanchi, but the peak of its productivity was dur ing the time of the Kushan (first-third centuries AD) and the following Gupta Dynasty (fourth-sixth centuries). The begin ning of the Medieval Period (seventh century) marked the decline of the school. The Kushans, one of the most prominent Indian dynasties, were of Scythian descent. These tribesmen, known in India as Sakas, originally occupied the territory bordering on Bactria, until they were forced by other nomadic tribes (known in China as Yiieh-chih) to move southward. In succession they at tacked the Parthians and the Greeks in India, reaching north west India by the middle of the first century BC. For almost a century the area was ruled by more or less autonomous tribes until sometime in the course of the first century AD when con Cover and opposite.

The art created under the auspices of these rulers represents some of the highest achievements produced by the school. Unlike some other centers Mathura was responsible for Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical art which, combined with the tradition of early pagan cults (worship of nature spirits, etc.), gave a great variety of sculptural representations. We find evidence of early Brahman shrines in Mathura,6 and during the reign of the Kushan rulers there were at least four Buddhist stupa-complexes in the immediate vicinity of Mathura and two major Jain stupas as well.7 Alexander Cun ningham began excavating these monuments, or more pre cisely mounds, after his initial discovery in 1836 of the first Mathura sculpture known as Silenus.8 A number of excava tions carried out on a regular basis from the 1850s by General Cunningham, Bagvanlal Indraji, F. S. Growse, Alois Anton Fiihrer, and others revealed an astonishing variety and wealth of sculptural material. When Growse established the Mathura Museum in 1874, much of this material formed the nucleus of that collection. The rest was primarily distributed between the Calcutta and Lucknow Museums, but a number of pieces found their way to New Delhi, Sarnath-Banares, Lahore, and other museums, including the British Museum and the Vic toria and Albert Museum in London. In the United States before the 1950s there were not more than ten Kushan sculptures of major significance.9 It would have been difficult at that time to write about the Mathura holdings in American collections and virtually impossible to concentrate on the contents of a single collection. Today the Cleveland Museum collection alone is sufficiently large to provide a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of Mathura sculpture and even an examination of the stylistic development of the school from the Sunga through Gupta Periods. Vedic Gods. Yakshas, Nagas, Salabhanjikas The sculptures that predate the formulation of the Mathura School are colossal images of yakshas 1-semi-divine nature spirits of the early pagan cults which impart wealth and pro tection to the worshiper.ll Few of them remain, but among a half a dozen examples the one best known12 is the Yaksha 83</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1.

The Cleveland Museum has a large Sunga Head of a Yaksha (Figure 2).13 This massive head in the round is adorned with a turban originally decorated with an ornament (moulimani) in the center, typical for the period but now missing (cf. Figure 6). The heavy round earrings, of which only a part of the right one remains, and the round fleshy face of somewhat animated quality indicate a Sunga date. Its weight and bulk are its most striking characteristics, and it retains in those features the archaic quality of the Mauryan yaksha figures. The tradition which it represents falls between the styles of the Yaksha from Parkham (Figure 1) and that of the Kushan image dedicated by Friar Bala (Figure 22). Furthermore, while intact, the head must have resembled closely the heads of Bharhut yakshas,14 which would indicate the first century Bc as the correct date for the sculpture. The Sikri red sandstone points to the Mathura area as its provenance. During the Kushan times the nature spirits of earlier cults such as yaksha[ils, naga[ini]s, and salabhanjikas-had been incorporated into Buddhism and become a favorite subject of the Mathura sculptor. It was in these "secondary" represen tations of semi-deities, which adorned the railings, pillars, and gates of the stupas, that the Mathura sculptor expressed him self best. This subject matter left him with greater freedom in expressing his individuality allowing for a variety of postures and types. Contrary to that, in the representations of ranking divinities, such as Buddhas, Tirthankaras, or Hindu gods, the artist was bound by numerous restrictions spelled out by the manuals (Silpa Sastras). The Attendant Bearing a Fly Whisk (Chauri) in the Cleve land Museum collection (Figure 3)15 represents a second century Kushan variant of the style originated in the Mauryan yakshas (Figure 1). It retains the heavy sculptural volume and monumental quality of the Yaksha from Parkham but at the same time loosens up in movement. The geometrized forms of the early sculpture are sacrificed here for the sake of greater realism. There is progress toward making it a sculpture in the round. It loses its relief quality and the back is carefully worked out (Figure 4), which is a rule with Kushan sculptures that fall into a category of free-standing objects (cf. Figures 7, 9, and 13). Even when the sculpture is intended as a relief, there is a tendency to decorate the back side if it is meant to be seen (cf. Figures 11, 17, and 25). The modeling of the Cleveland chauri-bearer displays a great deal of sensitivity in the fleshy, plump treatment of the torso which successfully contrasts with the crispness of the 84</page><page sequence="4">::?~~~~~~~~~~~~~rti ss:: ?:i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i "' :"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~f JI??: .ssa ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ : ::": i .;:iii~hu.~di ".:..:...... .:..:ii at :'8 5</page><page sequence="5">*:. .:.il:.: ?i:::'iliiiiiii~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~resiisbijiis.

It represents the late Kushan tradition and signals the new characteristics of the coming Gupta age. The body is more perfect and idealized, displaying at the same time the "inner breath" or prana quality. The ornaments and the gar ments are more subdued and the contrast between them and the surface of the body is less pronounced. The figure repre sents Nagaraja, a serpent-god associated with water. The frag ments of serpent coils, which originally surrounded the image, still remain on the lower left side of the figure.17 The flask held in its left arm (which is also an attribute of Bodhisattva Maitreya) is not uncommon in representations of nagas.18 Some sources identify its presence with the repre sentation of Baladeva (or Balarama),19 Krishna's brother, who is described in the Mahabharata as being addicted to drinking. However, J. Ph. Vogel points out that this icon ography developed in later times, when the depiction of Baladeva, "the plough-bearer" (essentially an agricultural deity, like the nagas connected with water-an all-important Figure 6 (below).

That the cult of nagas and naginis was very popular within the Mathura School is attested to by the numerous sculptures of this iconography coming from the region.21 Some of the most impressive examples in this country are found in the Brooklyn Museum (Figures 6 and 7) and in the collection of Norton Simon.22 The Brooklyn Museum image is of special importance to us since we believe it to be the mate to the Nagini in the Cleveland collection (Figures 8 and 9).23 Both figures are massive sculptures in the round, deeply carved, and of the same style. They have in common the facial type, the solid modeling of the bodies, and the arrangement of the garments. Furthermore, their sizes (Naga, 47 inches; Nagini, 49 inches) match perfectly, as does the quality of the porous mottled Sikri sandstone.

In the case of the Brooklyn sculpture proof is hardly needed. The serpent on the back of the image (Figure 7), with a now-broken snake hood, makes it obvious that it was meant to be a naga. The problem is somewhat more com plicated in the case of the Cleveland Museum sculpture since the only indication of her iconography, the snake hood around the head, is practically invisible. We believe, however, after a very close examination of the sculpture, that the piece of stone projecting to the left side of the figure, above the head (back cover), as well as the faint lines and indications of scales on the back of the image above the peacock tail, are the remains of a narrow snake hood, very much the same as on the sculpture from the Mathura Museum labeled by Vogel and Cunning ham "La Reine des Nagas" (Figures 10 and 11).24 The reverse side of the Cleveland Nagini (Figure 9) is decorated with an oval panel crowned by a motif of a peacock with an open tail. Below that, the area of the panel is filled with scale-like in cisions which may be a continuation of the naga hood or simply a part of an elaborate hair-do. Representations of pea cocks are found in other figures of this period such as a well known Lakshmi figure from the National Museum in New Delhi (Figures 12 and 13).25 They are associated in general with the ancient idea of mother goddess which is reflected in every female sculpture in India. The hair-do of the figure-with what is known in some parts of India as a borla ornament in the center of the forehead-is typical of the Kushan Period. Somewhat less usual is the heavy decoration which frames the head but which is found in sculp tures such as the Queen of Nagas (Figure 10) from the Mathura collection. It is a distant variation of the type already popular in pre-Kushan art.26 The voluptuous forms of the body with 90</page><page sequence="10">Figure 14. Yakshifrom Fyzbad. Figure 15.

They represent what can be labeled the mature style of the second century AD. Figures like the nagini were among the favorite representa tions of the Mathura School which particularly delighted in depicting feminine beauty. The yakshis, naginis, or salabhan jikas (wild nature spirits of the Vedic tradition adopted by Buddhism and Hinduism) represent the Indian ideal of femi nine beauty and symbolize the maternal energy of nature. This concept of the Great Mother goes back to such early times as the Indus Valley civilization (second millenium BC)28 and is not unique for India. It is found in the cultures of Europe and Asia Minor.29 In Mathura, and earlier in Bharhut and Sanchi, the subject was very popular. One of the most common repre sentations is the motif of dryad or tree-goddess, known in Indian art as salabhanjika (woman-and-tree). The maidens are shown touching the trees, causing them to bloom-a transfer of the fecundity of womanhood to the tree. The idea of seeing womankind as the symbol of fertility is undoubtedly responsible for the established canon of beauty. Full, perfectly rounded breasts ("like a heavily laden fruit tree"),30 broad hips, and a sophisticated slimness of the waist are universal to all Indian female representations. When one adds to this the fine featured oval face, with long almond shaped eyes, straight nose, bow-shaped brows, full lips, and fair complexion, it completes the ideal of feminine beauty that 91</page><page sequence="11">Figure 16 (below).

Reverse of Figure 16. _w_~ remains unchanged throughout various periods of Indian art. The Cleveland Museum has several examples of this type of Mathura sculpture that originally adorned the railings of Buddhist stupas. The first (Figure 15)31 shows a young damsel after a bath, wringing out her hair, while a crane catches the water in his beak. It is engraved on the monolithic railing. This, as much as the size of the railing, indicates that it was a part of the harmica, an enclosure around the umbrellas that crown the stupa.32 All the usual elements of the regular railing are present: plinth (alambana), upright pillars (thaba), three horizontal bars between them (suchi), and a coping (ush nisha). The thabas were probably decorated in alternating fashion with figures and lotuses (one full and twvo half medallions), and smaller lotus medallions adorned the suchi in the center. The coping was decorated with dormer windows above each upright pillar which, like the latter, must have</page><page sequence="12">Figure 18 (right). Torana Bracket with Salabhanjikas. Reproduced in color on cover. See the inside front cover for the reverse side of the bracket. Figure 19 (right below). Side view of Figure 18. alternated pairs of human heads with auspicious emblems (mangalas).33 The one shown here is a leaf-shaped bowl filled with a garland of flowers (so-called panna-pacchi). The reverse side of the railing is decorated in similar manner but with lotus blossoms only. It is of interest to note that the motif of a young woman wringing her hair was commonly adopted in later Buddhist iconography. Namely, in representations of the Temptation of Buddha by Mara, especially in Southeast Asia where the Earth Goddess, Prithvi, is shown in the same attitude. No doubt it symbolizes the life-giving waters that Nature bestows to stimulate growth and prosperity. ,In the same way, the fertility symbol of a woman-and-tree (salabhanjika) in Bud dhism is used in the Nativity scenes when Maya is shown holding on to the branch of a tree while giving birth to Buddha.34 Another sculpture that belongs in the category of salabhan jika representations (Figure 16)35 shows again a young heroine holding with her right arm a branch of the Asoka tree36 while her left hand is holding her breast, a gesture often referred to as "the sucking pose" (dugdhadharini mudra). The gesture is meant again to stress her aspect as the benign mother, whose breasts swell with milk for nursing.37 The reverse side of the pillar (Figure 17) is decorated with a Buddhist stupa at the top and a male figure within the architectural framework below. The part of the relief to the right of the male is damaged. The scene probably depicted one of the jatakas as is most fre quently the case, or possibly donors. The style of the salabhan jika figure is quite close to that of the famous yakshi pillars from Bhutesvar, presently in the Calcutta, Mathura, and Lucknow Museums, and the bracket toranas from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.38 The same is true of the reverse side of the pillar where especially the architectural framework of the niche corresponds almost exactly to the back decoration of the Bhutesvar pillars,39 and like the above sculptures it represents the style of the second century AD. Finally, there is one more sculptural fragment at the Cleve land Museum decorated with the motif of salabhanjika (Cover, inside front cover, and Figures 18-20).40 Because of its monu mental size one can safely speculate that it was an upper part of a torana pillar or bracket.41 The figures are carved in a very deep relief on both sides, giving the impression of a free standing sculpture. Each of the yakshis holds the branch of a flowering Asoka tree, while her other arm, now broken off, probably rested on her hip. The yakshis wear heavy earrings, necklaces, armlets, and bangles.

Strands of hair also fall over the shoulders and onto the opulent breasts. The faces, although partially damaged, display a perfect oval shape and regular, deeply carved Kushan facial features. Particularly striking is the vitality of the movement shown in the twist of the torsos, provoked by the highly raised arm. In truly indigenous Indian fashion, there is no angularity of forms as exemplified by the curvilinear outline of the arm and gently curving branches of the Asoka trees. There is a rhyth mic, melodious quality in the posture of these figures which recalls a dance pose and is so characteristic of Indian sculpture at its best. The style of the figures seems slightly more advanced than that of the earlier discussed salabhanjikas, and we tend to attribute it to the second half of the second century AD. Before closing the section dealing with demi-gods and Vedic divinities, one should also mention a sculpture in the Cleve land collection which falls into this category. It is a head of a wise sage (rishi) (Figure 21).42 The face is framed by a thick 94</page><page sequence="14">* s , ?.'.,4 ..

It has a moustache and hair braided and gathered on top of the head in a large knot in the manner adopted by sadhus. The broad face with well-rounded eyes is of a general Kushan type, with slightly more "realistic" touches than is the case with divine beings. Those characteristics, such as less regularly outlined eyebrows and somewhat prominent ears, are not unusual considering that we are dealing with the representation of a mortal. Another idiosyncrasy of this sculpture is the material of which it is made. It is not of a typical Sikri, reddish sandstone, but a more buff-colored stone that was used in the area of lower Uttar and Madhya Pradesh. Thus, it may not have been done in the immediate vicinity of Mathura. As far as the dating is concerned it probably belongs to the late first or early second century since it is not far removed from the ascetic types that one finds in reliefs of the Great Stupa at Sanchi.43 95</page><page sequence="15">Figure 22.

'~' Buddhist Images The Mathura School, among its many artistic achievements, is credited with the creation of the anthropomorphic image of the Buddha.44 This very complex problem of the origin of Buddha's image, studied by many scholars, cannot be satis factorily answered here, and it is not our aim to do so. How ever, we want to stress, as have many advocates of pro Mathura theory, that aboriginal images such as the above discussed yakshas and nagas inspired the representations of the Buddha in both artistic and iconographic terms. It will be remembered that the earliest references to Buddha in sculpture (in Bharhut and Sanchi) were aniconic, using symbols such as the empty throne, Bodhi tree, royal umbrella, imprint of his feet, stupa, etc. From the first century AD onward, chang ing Buddhist doctrine-i.e., the gradual shift from the Hina yana to Mahayana Buddhism-prompted the demand for an Figure 23. Buddha from Katra. Red mottled sandstone, H. 27-1/8 inches (69 cm.). Mathura, Kushan Period, probably first half of 2nd c. AD. Courtesy of the Archaeological Museum, Mathura. iconic representation of the Great Master. The canon for its depiction was borrowed from the tradition of earlier images. The iconography of Mahapurusha (the "Great Being") or Chakravartin (the "Ruler of the World") in which features such as Lakshanas45 are present, provided a basis for the depiction of Buddha's image. One of the earliest and best-known representations vari ously referred to as Bodhisattva or Buddha46 is the statue dedicated by the monk Bala, presently in the Archaeological Museum in Samrnath (Figure 22).47 This image, dated to the third year of Kanishka's reign, sets the pattern for standing figures of Buddha as much as the Buddha from Katra (Figure 23) is a prototype for seated images. These, not counting rare reclining images of Buddha, were the two standard represen tations of the Sublime Master. The iconographic variations are few and limited mostly to hand gestures (mudras).

Reverse of Figure 24. standing figures, such as the Friar Bala image, it is a standard feature to have the left arm holding the garment while the right (missing on the Friar Bala figure) expresses a gesture of blessing (abhaya mudra). The same is found in the Katra Buddha (Figure 23) and two other seated Buddhas from The Cleveland Museum of Art (Figures 24, 25, and 26).48 In the Gupta example (Figure 28), however, the hands originally expressed the wheel-turning mudra (dharma-chakra), the gesture of preaching. Other gestures in seated figures may indicate meditation (dhyana), exposition (varada), or earth touching (bhumisparsa). A sitting position (asana) is that of the meditation posture (dhyanasana), which derives from the pre-Buddhist, yoga tradition.49 Images such as the Friar Bala Buddha can be easily linked to the earlier yaksha figures and derive in direct line from Maurya and Sunga traditions. The style, although much more refined than in the Yaksha from Parkham (Figure 1) still retains a monumental, columnar quality, impressing by ex pansive volume and mass rather than outline as in Gandharan art. It is sculpture in the round, like the early yakshas, but calculated for a frontal view. Its position is rigid, with little movement. It is symmetrical; the feet are well separated. Yet the treatment of the body is much more sensuous and subtle than in pre-Kushan sculpture. The garments are the trans parent, "wet type," revealing the contours of the body. They are worn over the torso in open mode (over one shoulder). Except for the left shoulder and arm where the garment is gathered into regularly outlined folds, the chest gives the im pression of nudity. The same applies to the dhoti, which in seated figures is marked only by a supporting belt and the lower hemlines. The flesh displays a plumpness which is characteristic of Kushan sculpture.

The treatment of hair marked only by the forehead outline and lacking in texture is distinctive for early depictions of Buddha. In the case of seated images (Figures 23 and 24), the hair is gathered on the top of the head into a spiral bun which only vaguely remains an ushnisha. We may add that in Gandhara the hair is treated in a wavy pattern (slightly reminiscent of Figure 27), whereas in Mathura of later periods (from the second century'onward)50 it displays regular short curls (Figure 30).51 Although the Friar Bala statue is dated to the third year of Kanishka's reign, the dating of this precursory style is not a simple matter in view of the disputed dates of King Kanishka.52 If one would accept for Kanishka the dates of the early decades of the second century, as we are inclined to do, the style under discussion would be representative of the early second century. Even if we accept the latest proposed date, AD 144, it would place the style no later than the middle of the second century. The Katra Buddha, although probably slightly later than the Friar Bala figure, represents the same style as does the Cleveland Museum image and several other known sculptures of the same type, such as the fragment in the Munich Ethnological Museum,53 sculptures in the Boston Museum,54 and the Los Angeles County Museum,55 and several images in India. The Cleveland Museum Buddha (Figure 24) follows closely the pattern of the Katra image. It is placed on a lion pedestal with a scalloped-rim halo, a Bodhi tree behind, and two flank ing attendants. Although a great part of the halo now is broken off, enough is left to see that it relates closely to the Katra Buddha. The reverse side of the stone (Figure 25) is fully carved to show the back side of a pipal tree with the tree 99</page><page sequence="19">:::':"': :5. ' . -A~~~W ~~~~~~~~~~~~~''' ".':~ ~' ~ .. ..

It is in many ways similar to Figure 11, if sculpturally slightly less advanced. The flanking lions which appear on the pedestal-shown laterally with closed mouths and the plinth of the pedestal over their heads-are indeed, as claimed by Bachhofer, a fea ture of an early style from no later than the year 49 of Kanish ka's reign.56 Rowland when discussing the Katra Buddha makes the point that the type represents "an early example of the trinity in Indian art" and identifies the attendants as Indra and Brahma, who "later are replaced by Bodhisattvas."57 This type of group arrangement of an image flanked by attendants, in this case chauri-bearers, goes far back. One finds it already in aniconic representations at Sanchi where the stupa replaces the central image.58 The Katra Buddha, as stated by the inscription, is meant to depict the Bodhisattva Gautama, as is the Friar Bala image. Yet it displays faithfully all the lakshanas and attributes of Buddha. Thus it is evident that there is no distinction made between the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in early Kushan art.59 This identity of images, which is distinct from Gandharan art, is an important factor in proving the indigenous Mathura origin of Buddha's image. The next representation of Buddha in the Cleveland Mu seum collection (Figure 26) belongs to a later style of image, often designated the "Northwestern" type that developed in Mathura as a result of Gandharan influence. The mode of wearing the monastic robe (sanghati) over both shoulders and the regularly outlined folds are of Gandharan inspiration. When searching for examples of this type in Mathura, we will notice that one of the earliest is the image that dates to the year 49 of Kanishka's era,60 at the earliest, around the middle or likely the second half of the second century AD. Since the Cleveland Buddha does not seem to be innovative of this style one may assume that it dates to the third century, as suggested by Coomaraswamy.61 Unfortunately the head of the sculpture is missing, but it probably was not far from the type repre sented by the Jain Tirthankara image in this collection (Figure 27).62 The further development of this style can be easily traced in the Gupta-Mathura torso in the Cleveland Museum collec tion (Figure 28)63 dating to the fifth century. It relates closely in style to such sculptures as the famous Buddha from Jamal pur mound in the Mathura Museum (Figure 29). Like all Mathura sculptures of the Gupta Period, it preserves the plasticity of Kushan sculpture but combines it with a new Figure 29. Buddha from Jamalpur. Red sandstone, H. 86-5/8 inches (220 cm.).

The sanghati, worn in a covering mode (over both shoulders), with folds that spread irregularly from the right side to the left, is a standard pattern for the Mathura Gupta sculpture. One feels that it is less mechanical than that on the Kushan Buddha (Figure 26) and follows the contour of the body more realistically. The left hem of the garment, for instance, which forms a zigzag pattern, is used as a purely decorative element on the Kushan Buddha whereas on the Gupta Buddha the hemline simulates the fall of actual cloth. It is evident that the body itself with its inner energy captures the interest of the artist. The halo of the Cleveland Museum Gupta Buddha is now badly damaged, but what remains is sufficient to give us the idea that it was very similar to that of the Jamalpur Buddha (Figure 29). The Buddha is seated on a throne originally flanked on both sides by rampant lions, which seems to be a standard feature in representations of seated figures.64 We should add that the Gupta seated Buddha images are ex tremely rare. The best known is the Sarnath Buddha which displays the transparent garment of this school, as does the Mankuwar Buddha. Others are mostly Tirthankara figures which are totally nude.65 The Buddha images showing Mathura-type garments with folds are mostly standing ones, such as the well-known examples in the Mathura (Figure 29) and Calcutta museums66 and, in this country, a Buddha in the Kansas City Museum.67 Another characteristic of the Cleve land Museum Gupta Buddha which differentiates it from the Kushan images discussed earlier is the hand gesture. Although the arms are broken, the chips on the chest indicate that the Buddha was shown in the dharmacharkra mudra, or gesture 102</page><page sequence="22">CI r -" :' : ~i~~~~~,,:" .... ,. .

Selden. of preaching the first sermon, like the well-known Sarnath image and contrary to the Tirthankara figures that are shown as a rule in the dhyana mudra (meditation). Had the face of the image survived, it would further ex emplify the inner "life" that the body of the sculpture radiates. This can be verified by studying the Head of Buddha in the Cleveland Museum (Figure 30). The beautiful facial features are combined with heavy semi-closed eyelids which impart to the Buddha an appearance of meditative concentration and serenity. It is this perfect balance of spiritual and physical factors that places the Mathura sculpture of the Gupta Period among the finest examples of plastic art in the world. Finally to close the discussion on Buddhist images in the Cleveland Museum collection, one has to mention a Kushan Lion (Figure 31).68 A symbol of the Sakya clan from which Buddha descended, the lion was commonly represented in Buddhist art. By virtue of its strength it acted as a defender of Buddhist faith and often is found accompanying representa tions of Buddha (see Figures 22-24). On occasion, lions appear by themselves in more monumental sculptures where they probably functioned as guardian figures flanking the stupa gates or entrances to the Buddhist edifices. In these cases the standard representation (Figure 31) is with a large head, "roaring" mouth, broad chest, and front legs. Artists did not bother to shape the rest of the animal's body since it was meant to be viewed frontally. The Lion from the Brooklyn Museum (Figure 32) shows the same type, but it is more com plete. We would like to call attention to the decorative element of the carefully arranged mane and musculature marked arbitrarily by incised lines. Yet the body manages to convey strength and power. The face, somewhat humanized and humorous, displays a conceptual rather than realistic approach. Brahmanical Gods Mathura was the center of the Bhagavata cult from probably as early as the first century BC. We pointed out earlier the presence of Brahmanical shrines and images which date to Sunga times and thus predate the Buddhist activities at Mathura.69 Although Brahmanism flourished parallel with Buddhism, it was the latter that dominated during Kushan times, analogous with the rest of India. The Gupta Period is marked by the gradual revival of Brahmanism which even tually took over in India at the beginning of the Medieval Period, around the sixth to seventh century AD. Thus, we have numerous sculptures of Hindu gods in Mathura dating to the 104</page><page sequence="24">Figure 33. Vishnu. Red sandstone, H. 43 inches (109.2 cm.). Mathura, late Gupta Period, end of 6th c. AD. Purchase, John L. Severance Fund. CMA 63.580 classical and post-Gupta age. The favorite representations are those of the gods Vishnu and Surya70 since Mathura was the seat of the Vasudeva cult. The Cleveland Museum has several sculptures of this type. The first one represents Vishnu (Figure 33),71 presently mis sing his arms and consequently his attributes. However, his straight stance, indications of the original four arms,72 the kiritamakuta (conical cap with jewelled discs), and the remains of a halo (prabhavalli) are enough to confirm this icon ography. Figures of Vishnu answering the same description are preserved in several Indian museums.73 The style of the image, broadly speaking, derives from its Kushan predeces sors (Figures 3 and 5), except that the vigorous robustness of Kushan art is sacrificed in the name of the restrained elegance of the Gupta Period, or to be more precise, its late phase. The figure dates to the end of the sixth century, as indicated by the stylistic connections with such "transitional" sculptures as the Vishnu from Apshad in Bihar,74 which dates to the seventh century. Yet, the Cleveland Museum statue represents a some what earlier tradition which relates more closely to Gupta than to Pala art. It is particularly evident in the treatment of the lower part of the body, clad in a plain dhoti, or in much softer renderings of the ornaments, which in the case of the Apshad Vishnu, signal in their crispness the coming Pala age. In order to illustrate even better the type of these Gupta Vishnu images, another example is reproduced here (Figure 34)75 which predates Figure 33. However, the buff-colored sandstone (instead of the reddish Sikri stone) used for the sculpture indicates that it does not come from Mathura proper but possibly from the district of Allahabad; this seems to be reinforced by the stylistic evidence. The ultimate source of this style derives again from the Kushan images such as the Brooklyn Museum Nagaraja (Figure 6), where the side ar rangement of the belt supporting the dhoti is preserved, but instead of projecting out of the body as in Kushan sculpture, it is now reduced to a relief against the left thigh. The original four arms and remains of the halo around the head are still visible. It is, like the previous Vishnu, a sculpture in the round but intended for frontal viewing. The crown (kiritamakuta) represents a different type. The center motif of the casque is the "mask of glory" (kirtimukha) from whose mouth issue strings of pearls. Flanking the mask are aquatic monsters (makaras) devouring an unidentified animal. The same motif is found in the above discussed Vishnu (Figure 33), but there it is reduced to decoration under the center jewelled disc of the crown.

CMA 76.75 appears in the standing Vishnu from Unchdih in the Allahabad Museum.76 The pleated aureole with floating ribbons around the head, present here, is also found in the Allahabad Vishnu. Furthermore, both sculptures are similar in facial type and treatment of the body, except that the Allahabad figure is more squatly proportioned and represents a less sophisticated, more provincial version of the style. They must be close in date, and if we assume that the Allahabad figure represents, as has been suggested, mid-fifth century style. the Cleveland Museum image belongs to the later part of that century. The Head of Vishnu from Mathura in The Cleveland Mu seum of Art (Figure 35)77 also wears a crown which intro duces the kirtimukha placed within a framework of intricately fashioned jewels. The "mask of glory" fills the center disc with strings of pearls coming out of its mouth, flanked by makaras with additional jewelled discs on the sides. It relates to Figure 34 and represents the fifth-century style. In the case of yet another Head of Vishnu from the Cleve land collection (Figure 36),78 the "mask of glory" is of the lion-face type (simhamukha) with the tasseled ribbons coming out of its jaws. It forms the center of a pleated medallion which fills a square crown, used in later images (such as Figure 34) behind the head on the halo. The hair is rolled up at the back and has strings of pearls twisted around it. On both sides of the makara are projecting tufts of the band that holds the crown in place. This very unusual and beautiful Gupta head does not come from Mathura but from Besnagar in theVidisha District79 and as such (like Figure 34), although stylistically related, belongs outside the Mathura atelier. It represents the earliest style among the Cleveland Museum Vishnu images. Its similarity to the relief of Vishnu from Cave 6 at the nearby Udayagiri, which has been pointed out,80 and the distinct relationship with the late Kushan sculpture are, in our opin ion, unquestionable proof of a fourth-century date. In facial characteristics and spiritual content the Brahman ical heads (Figures 35 and 36) are no different from their Buddhist counterparts (Figure 30). The oval-shaped face dis plays regular features: almond-shaped eyes with heavy half closed eyelids, elegantly arching eyebrows, straight nose, and sensuous, beautifully cut lips. The eyebrows, lower eyelids, and lower lip are traced by a double line. This feature, appear ing already in some earlier Kushan sculptures (Figure 27), becomes a standard characteristic during the Gupta Period. Another Hindu deity whose cult flourished in the Mathura area during the Gupta Period parallel to that of Vishnu was the Sun God (Surva)) often identified with Vishnu. 81 The 106</page><page sequence="26">4 .... . . , . ....... 11 i 't.........:. .

It is not surprising that the fall of the Guptas and the end of the classical age in India marked the decline of Mathura as the leading art center. The peak of activity reached under the Kushans and Guptas could not last forever. Its strongest patronage, Buddhism, largely disappeared from India at the end of the Gupta dynasty, but a tradition so deeply rooted had to leave its imprint on the area in the period that followed. Thus one finds medieval sculptures that carry on the style and recall the earlier Gupta and Kushan models. An example of this type in the Cleveland collection is a sculpture of Ganga, Goddess of the Ganges River (Figure 38),84 as indicated by the makara she stands on.

The stone of the Cleveland Museum figure is not a typical Sikri sandstone although the reddish veins in it may suggest that it comes, broadly speaking, from the area of the Karri quarries. The style, on the other hand, is quite closely related to well-known figures from Mathura, such as the sculpture from the Museum in Calcutta (Figure 39). The roundness of the hips, the firmness of the thighs, the way that the garment clings to the body, the heavy anklets, and even the round pendant suspended from a long chain are present in both sculptures. They derive from Kushan examples, such as Figures 8, 12, 14, and 16, transformed through the Gupta style as represented by the Matrika figure from Tanesara in Gujarat, presently in the Cleveland Museum collection (Figure 40).85 Along with Figure 38 which was part of a shrine or temple ensemble placed at a door jamb, one finds other architectural fragments. A handsome example of this type is a monolithic square pillar carved on all four sides and decorated in the center part of the shaft with a vase and foliage (purna-kalasha), 109</page><page sequence="29">Figure 39.

One finds numerous examples of Gupta pillars in the Allahabad Museum, for instance, with similar decoration.87 They develop, as here, into a form distinctive to medieval monuments with chamfering and piercing through the stone at the comers. In Ellora one finds them in abundance in the Ramesvara, Dasavatara, Kailasanatha, and Buddhist caves (Cave 7).88 The sandstone, similar in its structure to that of the river goddess (Figure 38) suggests that the pillar comes from the Mathura region. from the Mathura region. 110</page><page sequence="30">Figure 41.

One significant exception is the portrait sculpture of Kushan rulers,89 which, however, is so rare that it is not surprising that we lack such an example. The collection not only allows the study of major iconographic types deriving from Vedic, Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu tradi tions, but also, as shown, permits tracing the development of the style. Beginning with the earliest monumental and heavy Sunga sculptures (Figure 2), through the robust and innova tive Kushan examples (Figures 3-27), leading to the beautiful, spiritualized Gupta images (Figures 28-30, 33-37), and ending with the early medieval sculptures exuberant in movement and form (Figures 38, 41). This diversity of types, combined with the unusual longevity of the school and above all its precursory character, determines the special position of Mathura in the development of Indian sculpture. It is the birthplace of the indigenous Indian style and the place of nativity of Indian gods-the Brindaban of Lord Krishna, the "Mathura of the Gods." STANISLAW CZUMA Curator of Indian Art 1.
