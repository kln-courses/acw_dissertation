Provided that no harmonic information was lost, I have left out certain cumbersome textural  arpeggiations (harp, celeste, and occasionally strings).  2. Selectively, I have omitted those grace notes Mahler uses to thicken string textures. (I have retained  all grace notes essential to the work’s melodic structure.)  3. A glitch in my notation software necessitated the omission of certain slurs—particularly those that  connect grace notes to parent notes.  4. Regrettably, little of Mahler’s nonpitched percussion is shown here, though I do include the three  hammer strokes. The result is no subsitute for a full score; Mahler’s orchestration rewards careful study. Nor is it especially convenient for piano  performance; for those purposes, I direct readers to Alexander Zemlinsky’s excellent four-hand transcription of the entire Sixth.
