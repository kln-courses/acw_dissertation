<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pseudo-Scientific Economic Doctrine Continued BY JOSEPH MAYER PART II. SUPPOSITIONS UNDERLYING COST AND UTILITY THEORY HE analyses thus far undertaken of cost theory and utility theory have viewed these doctrines as they originally were, namely, as the con- tentions of two conflicting groups of value theorists. And had the two rival groups been allowed to continue to match strength on the plane on which Macvane, for example, contended, the result would probably have been the destruction of them both. Un- derneath surface conflicts, however, the rival theories had much in common. As the twentieth century got under way, this state of affairs was discerned, with the result that in the end there was hand-shaking and backslapping all around and the inaugura- tion of a live-and-let-live policy. Although at first regarding each other as mortal enemies, these two groups of price-deter- mination theorists later came to see in one another something resembling blood kinship. But are the underlying assumptions which classicism and neoclassicism have in common any more realistic and scientific than the specific assumptions already examined? This is a question to which we now turn. In the adoption of a live-and-let-live policy by the rival theorists, cost became "disutility" and its advocates became satisfied with arguing that disutility and utility are simply two SI5</page><page sequence="2">516 Economic Doctrine sides of the same shield (Seligman), two blades of the price- determination scissors (Marshall), or equivalent elements in sys- tems of mechanical and organismic concords. This rapproche- ment meant the retention of much of the earlier classical dialectic and its further refinement.52 But if utility and disutility are related, then some of our criticisms of cost probably apply also to utility: first, regarding obstructions to free competition; second, regarding lack of a common, homogeneous unit; third, regarding normalistic, hedon- istic, and rationalistic assumptions. Regarding the first of these considerations, that is, obstruc- tions to free competition from the points of views of demand and supply, it was soon apparent that the same reasoning B6hm- Bawerk used to show deficiencies in cost theory could be turned against his own hypotheses, as Macfarlane indicated, for there are obstructions to competition among consumers, as well as among producers.53 The second consideration, or the lack of homogeneity and com- mensurability in utility and disutility, was searchingly analyzed by Persons on the score of inequality of incomes. Persons ob- jected to Marshall's statement that economic events "affect in about equal proportions all the different classes of society," pointed to the glaring inequalities of wealth in Great Britain (I3 per cent of the population in I904 receiving one-half the total income), and indicated that existing value relations would be materially changed if wealth were more equitably distributed. Persons then showed that the "last units" of utility for the non- competing groups of the millionaire, well-to-do, and poor classes are non-comparable. In a depression, for example, the rich lose luxuries, the well-to-do lose conveniences, and the poor lose 52 E. R. A.

Such losses are irreconcilable with respect to "units" of utility, both in "kind and quality."54 Disutilities show similar discrepancies on the score of pains suffered. The "final units" of disutility for ditchdigger, well- to-do farmer, and surfeited millionaire cannot be compared, averaged, or reduced to a common denominator. And any at- tempt to add the sacrifices of capitalist and landlord to those of laborer renders the situation still more incongruous. In general, considering the valuation of both goods and serv- ices, Persons concluded that no common homogeneous unit of utility or disutility can be posited, unless one assumes an equal distribution of wealth, productive capacity, and services, among laborers, landholders, and capitalists....55 If we add to these criticisms, based primarily upon inequal- ities of income, those already examined, that is, difficulties of equating labor-pains to elapsed times, of comparing the unique desires and appetites of different people, and of limiting the concepts utility and disutility to production and consumption respectively (rather than viewing them in terms of human wel- fare),-there seems altogether no real basis, with respect to price determination or otherwise, for hypothesizing common units among the heterogeneous psychological states involved in the ambiguous concepts of "utility" and "disutility." 54 Cf., C.

A market secures this result, for society acts as a unit-like an individual buyer." For a later discussion, admitting the effect of inequality, cf., F. W. Taussig, "Principles of Economics," 3rd ed. rev., Vol. I, pp. I6-I33, especially pp. 124-I29. For the distribution of British incomes in 1904, see Taussig, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 255.

It is well illustrated in the refinements of thought that followed cost-theory and utility- theory rapprochements, of which J. B. Clark's system is the most noteworthy example and Thorstein Veblen's criticism the most penetrating. Veblen's Criticism Veblen recognized Clark as one of the great figures in eco- nomics and his system as a direct continuation of classical thought, including both cost and utility arguments on a plane of equality. Veblen also recognized that Clark's system, like other classical systems, emphasizes distribution factors primarily. Though space is devoted in such systems to consumption and production, these are construed almost entirely in adquisitive pecuniary terms and "all human motives tend to be reduced" to such terms.56 Classical notions of "primitive life," Veblen continued, simply throw the normalized competitive suppositions into the fore- ground, and make "natural" and "normal" coincide with the conventional, which, in turn, is accepted as "just and equitable" and as inevitable under the hypothetical freedom of competition. Any departures from this "natural state of man" are regarded as temporary "aberrations," "excesses," or "perversions," which if let alone will right themselves. As a corollary of these sup- positions, Veblen went on, the use of "statics" and "dynamics" is purely perfunctory, and under Clark's system these terms are virtually interchangeable. The more "dynamic" the situation, the nearer do we come to a "static" ideal, which is the natural "norm of competitive life."57 56 Cf., John Bates Clark, "Essentials of Economic Theory," Macmillan, New York, 1907; and Thorstein Veblen, "Professor Clark's Economics," l'he Quarterly Journal of Economics, February, I908, pp. I47-I95 (I48-I50). 67 Veblen, op. cit., pp. 15I, 154-157.

Mayer 5 9 Furthermore, static normality, Veblen pointed out, is merely another name for hedonistic equilibration, cumulative evolu- tionary changes being left entirely out of account. Whether among the superstitious Aleutian fishermen or among modern factory workers, economic processes are in classical theory pre- sumed to be exercises in hedonistic computation, all substantially alike except for arithmetical details. Questions of "genesis, growth, variation, process," are nowhere provided for. The effect of such ideas on the meaning of capital is to force the omission of its most essential, intangible, and pecuniary features. It becomes wholly mechanized and materialized, so that, for example, the process of grinding the rough edges off plowshares before they leave the factory might properly be re- garded as removing some of the "capital" embodied in them.58 Another important effect of such ideas is the inference that capital and labor each has a specific productivity and that, under the "ideal competition" of the "static state," each gets the exact amount of wealth it creates, that is, a reward proportionate to its contribution. The difficulty here lies, of course, with the assumption of mechanical and interchangeable units (whether of labor, capital, disutility or utility). These units are not homo- geneous and interchangeable, while, on the other hand, the prod- uct is inseparably joint. The specific productivity contention really amounts to saying that the worker gets what he can and the consumer pays what he has to, which is true enough but hardly fruitful with respect to economic theory. Elaborating upon the difficulties inherent in the dogma of reward according to specific productivity, Veblen found two other suppositions in Clark's system which are inconsistent with it. One is the assumption that all but a few marginal individuals secure a consumer's surplus of utility. How can this be, Veblen asked, if according to "the natural law of final productivity," each man gets only the precise hedonistic equivalent of "the total product that he personally creates?" The other sup- position has to do with monopolistic gains. These, it should be noted, follow consistently from the pursuit of that phase of hedo- 68 Veblen, op. cit., pp. I59-I66.</page><page sequence="6">520 Economic Doctrine nistic logic which aims at maximizing utility and minimizing cost, at limiting supply at that critical point where price multiplied by quantity will be the greatest possible. But such logic also contradicts the specific-productivity argument, for at the critical price the monopolist not only gets the full product of his labor but a surplus, as much surplus in fact as he could possibly get. And, by classical assumption, the consumers also get a maximum of "effective utility" at the monopolistic price. Thus both sides seem to get the classical maximum; and still monopoly gains are spoken of by utility theorists as "robbery" and "plunder"! The inconsistencies Veblen thus disclosed lie at the very heart of classical and neo-classical theory, which in part turns upon the contradictory presumptions of a balance between production and consumption on the one hand and of an outstripping of consump- tion by production on the other. One premise leads to "specific productivity"; the other to "consumer's surplus" and "monop- oly gains"; both of which diametrically opposed presumptions the classicists and neo-classicists appear to embrace with equal facility. Behind all these normalistic-hedonistic-rationalistic dogmas, Veblen continued, lies the idea of "one right and beautiful" economic mechanism, which is now here, which is inevitable, and which we can do nothing about, except possibly to keep the wheels from getting off the track.69 In a later analysis, Veblen went over utility-disutility argu- ments more generally, re-emphasized the foregoing difficulties, and laid particular stress upon the failure of classicism to deal with cumulative institutional forces and with pecuniary factors. Modern research, he reiterated, has indicated that economics 6 Ibid., pp. I68-I82, I90-I95. For an excellent analysis and refutation of Clark's specific productivity doctrine as such, see W. M.

Mayer 521 must analyze the "life-history of material civilization," which is primarily "a cumulative sequence of habituation," and which varies incontinently, cumulatively, and withal somewhat con- sistently. This institutional process of habit and custom is completely omitted by utility-disutility analysis or is treated as inconsequential. With respect to pecuniary institutions, the unreal classical point of view has had the effect of a rather peculiar inversion of ideas. Price conventions not only dominate and permeate all modern business activity, but they are also reflected in behavior which is essentially non-pecuniary; and yet hedonism and classi- cism would have us believe that even in business enterprise it is not questions of price, of pecuniary income and outgo, that are dominant, but, rather, hedonistic computations of utility-dis- utility. Thus the money phraseology is made to disappear only to come back again, "theoretically expurgated," as a "refined system of barter" between hedonistic magnitudes. Such an in- version of pecuniary logic has been woven into the very tissue of classical and neo-classical theory. It is small wonder that marginal dogmas which foster this anomaly should have missed the chief elements of our economic life.60 Mitchell's and Downey's Analyses Following Veblen's penetrating attack upon the premises under- lying classical economic theory, several important elaborations and extensions of his criticism appeared, among which the analy- ses of Mitchell are outstanding. After pointing out the false psychological premises underlying classical economics, Mitchell reviewed four types of subsequent developments in theory.61 60 Veblen, "The Limitations of Marginal Utility," Journal of Political Economy, November, I909, pp. 620-636.

The first is represented by Pantaleoni's idea of "an idle science though a true one," the answer to which is that in economics we are interested in actual conditions, not in the unreal premises of an "idle science." The second type, the mechanics of self-interest, is akin to the first, except that the admittedly unreal premises laid down are supposed to be a "simplification" or "schematization" drawn from actual conditions for the purpose of affording a clearer understanding of the facts. The difficulty here is that the as- sumptions used in the hedonistic calculus are now known to be inapplicable to reality, which, to follow the methods of science, should mean their total rejection and the postulation of experi- mental hypotheses.62 The third type of more recent theory, eclecticism, claims to pick out the best in all preceding theory and to discard the rest. But the best of the classical ideas are still unreal, so that the net result is the retention of the form if not the substance of past errors. Thus eclectics continue to commit "the intellec- tualist fallacy," which assumes economic behavior to be prima- rily rational, when as a matter of fact much of it is irrational. Associated with these unreal assumptions, Mitchell continued, is the tendency, stressed by Veblen, to invert the meaning of pecuniary concepts. Adam Smith set the precedent for this inversion by regarding money as superficial, when in fact the habits engendered by pecuniary concepts have in the course of time come to dominate much more than business transactions, have conserved thought, have heightened industrial efficiency, and have rendered huge co6perative undertakings possible. Mitchell reviewed two particular errors that have resulted from the inversion of pecuniary logic: one, the placing of modern man and the savage on substantially the same footing in economic activity; the other, the substitution of artificial subjective-cost, hedonistic, and marginal-utility concepts for the real money facts 62 Mitchell, op. cit., pp. 107-IO8, quoting Maffeo Pantaleoni, "Pure Economics," tr. by T.

The theorist thus remains "superficial where he means to become profound." How could such an inversion and neglect occur, Mitchell asked, without the situation becoming glaringly apparent? Because, although pecuniary concepts were "read out" of actual practice by the classicists, an analogue of pecuniary logic was "read into" the substituted unreal abstractions and was then by an extension of scope made universal and automatic in all human behavior. The effect of this inversion was not merely formal. Lts extension to cover irrational human activity, its exaggeration of rational calculations, its failure to take into account the fact that pecuniary logic is relatively hard for people to comprehend, caused the utter obscuration of really vital economic issues. In brief, eclecticism continues to take economics out of its evolutionary setting, regards pecuniary concepts as empty sym- bols, makes for an artificial and superficial view of business phenomena, obscures the relation between pecuniary value and serviceability, and saves itself from utter absurdity only by mak- ing its unreal conceptions run roughly parallel to the realities of pecuniary practices.63 The fourth type of recent economic theory, Mitchell continued, is the evolutionary, which endeavors to study economics in terms of modern psychology and of institutional development. Actual human nature is here made the heart of the study, pecuniary institutions are investigated as an outgrowth of habit and cus- tom, explanations are couched in "genetic" terms, institutions are traced to habits and habits to instincts, and basic human- nature types of economic conduct are differentiated from those engendered and enforced merely through the power of long- established institutions .... 64 63 Mitchell, op. cit., Part I, p.

Regarding the first of these, Downey observed that habit, not reasoned choice, governs most of our acts, that habits are mainly conditioned by existing conventions, that non-habitual acts are motivated as often by outside suggestion as by deliberation, and that marginal utility theory, with its exclusive concern with rationalistic appraisal, thus misses the most important features of the individual valuation process. Nor is anything here gained by the marginalists in substituting "gratification" or "psychic income" for "utility" and in denying hedonistic implications. Deprived of its hedonistic-rationalistic basis, marginalism re- duces itself to the unobjectionable although puerile statements that people will buy only what they want, that in a perfect market they will all pay alike for a given commodity, and that they will offer only what they are willing to pay. One might add, also, that what they are willing to pay is conditioned by what they are accustomed to pay and by what they can afford to pay, and that what they want is conditioned by what they think they want or are made to believe they want.65 As for the second point, price determination, Downey insisted that marginal utility analysis is likewise futile even in the narrow rationalistic sphere of business activity in which it might con- ceivably be thought to apply. Nowhere does it get any further than the superficial conclusion, which should be an initial prem- ise, that demand and supply determine price.

We start with the demand and the supply of hogs and analyze further. The first thing we then encounter is a complex market organization which can cause wide price fluctuations without a change either in pork- eating habits or in the aggregate supply of hogs. It is these institutional market forces which apparently determine price, and these marginalism fails to touch. Furthermore, these forces appear to determine not only price, but the so-called "margin" as well. This Downey elucidated in an examination of the de- mand and supply considerations that determine the price of turkeys at Thanksgiving time, reviewing the influence of such factors as ceremonial custom, population and wealth distribution, marketing and transportation facilities, and the accidents of the particular growing season. If the "margin" is itself the result- ant of price-fixing forces, he asked, how can it be regarded as determining the price? Downey concluded, as Veblen and Mitchell had, that institu- tional settings and customary ways of thought are the important factors for economic analysis. Price is determined by these, not by so-called utility and disutility with their unreal and fallacious assumptions.66 T'he Dogma of Unfailing Mutual Gain in Exchange As an example of the unreality of modern dialectical refine- ments of classical and neo-classical theory, we may profitably examine the dogma of unfailing mutual gain in exchange, which examination will also serve to clarify another fallacy associated with such theory, namely, the assumption that, in modern money exchanges, barter transactions still predominate. In general, the dogma of mutual gain maintains that, unless there were a gain in "utility" to both parties, no act of exchange would occur, as in the giving of five dollars for a hat, and that, expunging the money medium in accordance with the classical inversion of pecuniary logic, the transaction reduces itself to a barter between goods and services, or to the exchange of a day's work for the u Downey, op. cit., pp. 263-268.</page><page sequence="12">526 Economic Doctrine hat. As a matter of fact, not only does the assumed gain in "utility" continue to be superficially measured by the effaced money, since goods and services are compared in pecuniary terms, but the dogma is distinctly mischievous and false in that the implied barter transactions do not in general occur in modern society.67 Regarding the superficial character of the dogma, take the exchange of a horse and a cow as an example which has rendered yeoman service. If we go behind the moment of exchange, considering the utilities enjoyed and the disutilities undergone from the time of original possession, it becomes obvious that in the complete accounting there may just as often be a loss as a gain. But what about the argument when limited, as it usually is, only to the act of exchange itself? Does it continue to have any serious meaning? It will help to a clearer understanding here if the issue is resolved into two parts: first, having to do with the nature of the "gain" in the act of exchange; second, having to do with the nature of the mechanism of exchange itself. As for the nature of the alleged "gain," it is obvious that the act of exchange is a special aspect of general human behavior. We may therefore say that man "gains utility" in every act or he would remain quiescent. Thus broadened, the doctrine in- cludes both rational or conscious and irrational or subconscious behavior. This is as it should be, and the result is as applicable to economic acts as to others. Since most of our activity is subconscious however, the alleged "gain" in "utility" cannot be for the most part rational in character. And if we wish to as- sume that the calculations of gain and loss nevertheless go on subconsciously, we must perforce extend the calculus to all organic processes and to all organisms, which leaves us with the conclusion that the imputed "gain" is the "preference" of organic life over death. But such a biologic truism robs "value," 67 Cf., Fairchild, Furniss, and Buck, "Elementary Economics," Macmillan, New York, 1926, Vol. I, p. 297; also, idem., discussion on pp. 308-3o0; and Mitchell, "The Rationality of Economic Activity," Yournal of Political Economy, March, I9I0, pp. 205-216.</page><page sequence="13">J. Mayer 527 "gain," and "utility" of all technical economic meaning. From this point of view, then, the dogma is superficial and misleading.68 As for the analogy of swapping or barter, it may readily be seen that this does not for the most part fit modern exchange conditions. We do not ordinarily attach utility to each article we produce and then swap for something else. We produce for the market, and the return we receive is a monetary return. Modern man is interested in this return, in this purchasing power (as Macvane realized more than two score years ago), so that, insofar as the dogma of mutual gain rests upon the swapping or barter assumption, it rests upon a false premise.69 On any realistic basis, the matter should be stated in terms of the exchange of an individual's income or purchasing power for the things and services that satisfy his wants. For example, to a wage earner the question then becomes, does he feel that his salary is sufficient to cover his wants or that he is being paid what he thinks he is worth? Most people, it may be assumed, do not think that they are being paid more than they are worth; but such an obvious absurdity is precisely what the dogma of mutual gain would have us believe with respect to all exchanges 68 With respect to the importance of judgment in valuation, see: R.

To sum up the argument, there are, in brief, three specific difficulties in the dogma of mutual gain: (I) that if it is applied only to the immediate act of exchange it is meaningless, whereas if all relevant utilities and disutilities are taken into account the result may just as often be a loss as a gain; (2) that it either presupposes an all-pervasive rationality in human acts, which is contrary to fact, or it reduces man to a subconscious calculating device, which robs "gain" and "utility" of all economic meaning; (3) that it presupposes as a general practice the continued existence of the (for the most part) long-since-departed custom of swapping or barter of goods for goods, whereas modern pro- duction is almost entirely for the market and in terms of the purchasing power secured. The grain of truth which undoubtedly gives the dogma of mutual gain in exchange most of its continued vitality is the fact that the complex modern industrial system has brought an im- mense gain in "utility" to every one as compared with the benefits of a more primitive economy. But it is mass produc- tion under the machine process which is responsible for these benefits, not acts of exchange merely. The medieval notion was that exchanges were in themselves bad, in that one person's gain was considered some one else's inevitable loss. Hence the dogma of mutual gain was developed. But no one any longer questions the virtue of an exchange economy. The dogma has thus long since become an anachronism, and it would doubtless by this time have been buried with honors and have been al- lowed to rest in peace, were it not still needed to bolster the contentions of normalism, hedonism, and rationalism in economic theory.70 Pseudo-Analogies: Mechanistic and Organismic Fallacies Besides normalistic, hedonistic, and rationalistic assumptions, mechanistic and organismic analogies need to be examined before 70 J.

Mayer 529 our analysis of the preconceptions underlying cost and utility theory is complete. Mechanistic analogies are found in the thinking of all peoples and are responsible for a great deal of pseudo-scientific reasoning in social study.71 At a time of epoch-making advance in any discipline, the dominant type of social theorizing reflects the cur- rent vogue. It was not strange, therefore, in the seventeenth century, when mathematics and physics experienced a tre- mendous impetus, that social study became permeated with mathematical and physical analogies and that the writings of students of society were filled with references to man as a kind of machine or automaton, to individuals and societies as a kind of astronomical system, and to similar analogical references. More recent mechanistic analogies have added little to this seventeenth century product, except possibly in such amplifica- tions as are represented in the works of Bentham and Herbart.72 A number of illustrations of such mechanistic analogies have been collected and criticized by Sorokin, who finds them inade- quate on two counts: They constitute a two-edged logical fal- lacy; and they are not borne out by actual experience. Logically, they either apply narrow judgments (physical ones) to broader phenomena (social) to which they apply only in part, 71 Cf., Mayer, "Toward a Science of Society," op. cit., pp. 172-173; "The Techniques, Basic Concepts, and Preconceptions of Science and Their Relation to Social Study," op. cit., pp. 458-462. 72 For further details regarding such borrowings, see Pitirim Sorokin, "Contemporary Sociological Theories," Harpers, New York, I928, pp. 3-37.

"Social physics" is thus like a hypo- thetical science of "ten-cent cigars," based upon physical princi- ples which in reality apply to all material phenomena but in the pseudo-science are made to appear as the special characteristics of ten-cent cigars or of society alone. At the same time, in mechanistic analogies applied to society, the physical facts are rendered anthropomorphic. From the point of view of actual experience, we find no indi- cation that the presumptions of mechanistic social analogies are borne out in practice. There is no evidence that hunger or sex compel attention directly as the mass and inversely as the distance; nor are any other generalizations of this character empirically verifiable.73 Economic applications of mechanistic analogies have already been sufficiently illustrated in these pages. Natural normality, hedonistic calculations, an equilibrium of economic forces, statics versus dynamics, are suppositions drawn by analogy from phys- ical science; they were projected when these sciences became the vogue; and they continue to be employed because of the mo- mentum gained in authoritative promulgation. That they lead for the most part to unwarranted and fallacious conclusions should finally in our day become sufficiently clear.... When biologic generalizations came to the fore in the nine- teenth century, analogies drawn thereform also penetrated social and economic thinking, especially the belief that society is an organism. Such analogies are likewise not new, but because the more modern nineteenth century organismic view is the most advanced, we shall confine our attention to it here, the contem- porary notion being summed up thus: (I) society is a special biologic organism: (2) its essential functioning is like that of any other organism; (3) it is subjected to the same biological laws; and (4) sociology and economics as sciences must be built on biology.74 73 Sorokin, op. cit., pp. 29-36; also L.

They are logi- cally fallacious for similar reasons, and they are not borne out by the facts of experience. But for social theory more can be learned from organismic than from mechanistic analogies, pro- vided we differentiate between two sets of inferences: first (the valid ones) that sociology and economics must to some extent depend on biology, that society is not entirely artificial, and that it represents "a kind of living unity" different from a mere sum of the isolated individuals composing it; second (the invalid ones) that, because of these things, society must itself be an organism and must be actuated by strictly biologic laws. Society is neither a mechanism nor an organism; but for a Longmans Green, New York, 1926, pp. 447-452, in which, with delightful irony, he pictures the results of the organismic view of society in the following words: "It is clear that if the analogy between human society and the cellular composition of the organism is adopted, in so far as an aggregation of men are organized in the image of a man, it must be at the expense of their manhood. If men assume the r61e of cells or organs they must forfeit personal autonomy or delegate it to one oftheir members.... "In short, the several members of a society can be embraced within one person only in so far as all members save one are subordinated to the purpose which that one has for them. They will enter into the personally integrated society not as interests but as objects.... "A whole is sometimes more highly integrated than its members, as in the relation of the plant to its component cells; and sometimes less integrated, as in the relation of the colony to its component ants. Combining these two types of relationship, we get the case in which an individual whole is both higher than its own constituent members and also higher than the whole of which it is itself a member. The progression from cell to colony is not a steadily ascending progression, as is readily and mistakenly supposed, but an ascent and a descent in which the highest point is reached half-way. This intermediate and highest point, is the animal or man." "John of Salisbury, in the twelfth century, and Nicholas of Cusa, in the fifteenth, made especially notable attempts to correlate the parts of the 'body natural' and the 'body politic.' According to the former writer, 'the prince is the head, the senate the heart, the court the sides, officers and judges are the eyes, ears and tongue, the executive officials are the unarmed and the army is the armed hand, the financial department is belly and intestines, landfolk, handicraftsmen and the like are the feet.' When these feet are in distress, as is so often the case, the state has gout. The ecclesiastics, using the same method, argued against the claims of the state, that if the emperor as well as the pope were a head, the organism of mankind would be a 'two-headed monster, an animal biceps.' The state, owing to the number of its feet, turned out to be a centipede; and the growing strength of the imperial party forced the conviction that mankind did in fact have two heads. Thus the outcome of an effort to enhance the dignity of men was to conceive them as members or organs of a bicephalous centipede."</page><page sequence="18">532 Economic Doctrine constructive study of the phenomena of society, a proper frame of schematic reference is nevertheless helpful. Sorokin out- lines four views of social phenomena, the mechanistic, the nomi- nalistic, the organic, and the functional, favoring the last- mentioned since the functional approach is at least free from the pseudo-analogical difficulties inherent in the mechanistic, atom- istic (nominalistic), and organismic approaches.75 Economic Organismic Systems We have not thus far dealt with economic organismic analogies as such, even though one of the chief tenets of J. B. Clark's system, which Veblen criticized on other grounds primarily, was organismic in character. Clark's thorough-going use of the organismic analogy is seen in his early work (I886) where he insisted that society is an organism "in literal fact," divided social organisms into "vertebrates, articulates, mollusks, and radiates," spoke of society measuring utilities "like a solitary tenant of an island," stressed the notion of social valuation, and wrote about commodities, like "molecules of nutriment," following the unerring "circulatory laws of the social system" and bringing to each member just what it most needs. Later Clark used both mechanistic and organismic analogies, the first much more than the second; but the latter continued to be in evidence and served to round out the harmonic whole of his system, the idea of "effective social utility" being particularly employed as a presumptive measure of price.76 With the transmutation of "cost" into "disutility" went a marked proliferation of the organismic analogy in economic theory. Seligman typified the extent to which the tendency was carried. Value, he said, is primarily expressed in "social mar- ginal utility" on the one hand, and in "social marginal disutility" on the other; these are "real equivalents," no matter how un- 76 Sorokin, op. cit., pp. 195, 207-2I3. 76 J.

When cost theory and utility theory are thus "interpreted in their true social light," he went on, they mean the same thing.77 There is no need to multiply illustrations of the employment of organicism in economic thinking or to repeat preceding general objections to the organismic analogy. Critical attacks finally came even from utility advocates themselves, from Schumpeter and Davenport outstanding among them. Schumpeter pointed out that all economists start their analyses with wants and the satisfaction of wants and that this neces- sarily implies the existence of individuals, for they alone "can feel wants." Society has no sense organs or nervous system. In certain ways, he conceded, social contact naturally influences value, as in imitation and fashion, but beyond such obvious relationships he held that one cannot go without being misled, unless one accepts or takes for granted communistic implications. Communism and capitalism, he pointed out, represent radi- cally different types of society, with different methods of pro- duction, distribution, and valuation. "Social value" as devel- oped through organicism might hold under communism. It does not hold under capitalism. "Social value," Schumpeter continued, makes for an unwar- ranted optimism, assumes that each individual and productive agent ultimately gets what he or it is "worth to the community," and sanctions all that is actually happening in society. Only by way of the implications of communism or of a control by a beneficient despot, could the organismic analogy have any prac- tical import. Thus any attempt to substitute "social value" for the actual valuation processes found in modern capitalistic society can lead only to conclusions that are "separated from reality by a great gulf.... "78 Davenport, like Schumpeter, stressed similar misconceptions but couched his criticism more broadly to cover three historical 77 Seligman, op. cit., pp. 323-346; also B. M.

Things must be going well, or what can God be about? Each of us is working out the Great Plan; hence the interests of each must be the inter- ests of all, trade is good for the trader and therefore for society, "private gain must accord with public welfare," and each person gets the full product of his social contribution. Through the second tendency, a belief in the justice of Natural Law in social affairs, the sceptics come to the same conclusions as the devout. It is "the old faith unitarianized," sterilized, and rationalized. Thus there are "great reservoirs of compelling force making for the good"; "the right is destined to ultimate triumph"; "the soul of things is just"; evolution becomes the "last word of scientific faith, and the ameliorative trend a popu- lar certitude." With the third tendency, a belief in the righteousness of Laissez Faire, Davenport had more patience. Its ascendancy served a better incidental purpose in sweeping away "stupid and unjust legislation," the privileges of "caste and class," and certain obstacles to the "development of popular institutions." But the main result was virtually the same as that of the other two tend- encies, and economists used similar arguments: that the good of each is always the good of all, that selfish enterprise results in social welfare, and that past governmental "meddling" has been bad and must be prevented for the future, so that beneficent forces can have unhampered sway. In the light of these preconceptions, Davenport continued, classical and neo-classical economic theory could not help but be what it is. The conception of competition as "voluntary co6peration," of capital as always socially beneficial, of income 79 H. J. Davenport, "Social Productivity Versus Private Acquisition," Quarterly Journal of Economics, November, I9Io, p. 96.

Mayer 535 as a measure of "social service performed," of distribution as justified by a socially productive process, of all gainful occupation as socially creative,-these and similar conceptions are not con- fined to any one school of economic theory, but to cost and utility theorists alike, to the "genus economist in general." Such conceptions, Davenport went on to say, are very far from representing the actual facts, for none of these conclusions is true. "Economic productivity is not a matter of piety or merit or deserving, but only of commanding a price." Similarly with capital. A bawdy house and a burglar's jimmy are capital. "Lobbyists, panderers, and abortionists are producers; that they are paid is the adequate proof." The actual facts are difficult to accept because of the deep-rooted character of our social preconceptions. Hopes and aspirations get constantly mixed with the reality, as though a physician were writing his sympa- thies into his prescriptions. Until this eighteenth-century back- ground of misapprehension is eliminated from modern thought, "the grotesque unreality of current economic doctrine" will con- tinue, economists will remain busy picturing utopias and insisting that they are real, and polital economy will be nothing more than a "sheer farce."80 Davenport's portrayal is very telling and picturesque. False inferences are constantly being drawn from mechanistic, or- ganismic, or other analogies, especially where they serve mainly to keep alive the afore-mentioned theological, naturalistic, or amelioristic presuppositions handed down from the past. T'oward a More Scientific Point of View We may now focus the considerations presented in preceding pages by contrasting the classical with a more modern point of view and by raising the question as to whether or not neo-classi- cism can survive. With respect to human relations, if it be regarded proper to assume a Beneficent Plan, a justice in Natural Law, or a right- eousness in Laissez Faire, then all must certainly be "right with the world" and the real and the ideal are identical, at least 80 Davenport, "Social Productivity Versus Private Acquisition," op. cit., pp. Io6-II8.</page><page sequence="22">536 Economic Doctrine "normally" or in the "long run." God, as an omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient Being, is in His Heaven, where He reigns in perfect Absolutism, watches benevolently over the world, and regulates its affairs for the best. On such an assump- tion, social theory was bound to be for the most part an effort at "rationalization," at making actual conditions appear just, beautiful, and good. In economic affairs, it seemed equitable to Adam Smith and his followers that goods should exchange according to the quantity of labor embodied in them, according to the relative sacrifices entailed in their production, to the accompanying danger and irksomeness, to the time and waiting that must elapse before productive effort can materialize in finished goods. To the Austrians, it appeared fair that what the consumer pays for goods should measure their usefulness or utility to him. To the hedonists- and utilitarians, it seemed proper that the pains or sacrifices of production should equal the pleasures or utilities of consumption. To the rationalists, it appeared reasonable that man should be constantly adding utilities and subtracting dis- utilities to make sure that the Heavenly Balance was being maintained, though it apparently did not occur to them that they were thereby bringing into question the Divine Bookkeep- ing, which had previously been assumed to be perfect. In fact, an improvement on the Heavenly Plan was already being pro- posed, namely, the maximizing of satisfactions and the minimiz- ing of costs, in place of an equilibrated counterpoise between them, surpluses of "utility" rather than a quid pro quo. To the mechanists, it seemed fitting that natural laws of a physical nature should be the ones to maintain the balance between pro- duction and consumption or, if necessary, to bring the social machine back to its normal "equilibrium of forces." To the organicists, it appeared good and beautiful that society should be an organism, with each part contributing to the organic welfare of the whole according to its productivity and receiving in return the precise equivalent of what it had created or needed, overlooking the fact that production and need are, in actual life, far from being identical.</page><page sequence="23">J. Mayer 537 This "making the wish father to the thought" is, as has been indicated, not a scientific procedure. So long as astronomers, for instance, assumed that heavenly bodies were "perfect" and without "blemish" and that they perforce had to travel in circles, there could be no scientific foundation for their discipline. It took Galileo and Kepler, among others, to destroy this miscon- ception. In preceding pages we have endeavored to show to what extent the classical economic tradition is built on false premises, has made use of illogical reasoning, and fails to accord with the facts of business and of general economic behavior.8' Some of the real questions that have not been answered by the traditional theory are the following: What is the history of customary price with respect to various key commodities? How far have habit and consumer ability to pay prevented price from being lowered toward the cost-of-production minimum? In what ways have predatory price-fixing and competition progressed from the stage of "nature red in tooth and claw?" To what extent and in what directions has competition thus far been con- stantly frustrated by scarcity and monopoly conditions both in production and consumption? What has been the effect of fluctuations in purchasing power upon the maintenance of given standards of living among different classes of society, among business men, property owners, professional men, salaried white- collar workers, unionized skilled laborers, unskilled workers? To what extent are existing standards of living the effect of misleading advertising, high-pressure salesmanship, and the ap- ing of luxurious display, and to what extent do they really reflect "human utility"? These are but a few of the many realistic questions unanswered by traditional economic theory, which will readily suggest themselves in the light of foregoing considera- tions. ... To some minds, however, it will still seem axiomatic that a Beneficent Plan, carried out by an Absolute Deistic Being deal- 81 The substance of this concluding section, together with a brief epitome of the argument of preceding sections, was presented at the St. Louis meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, January 2, I936, under the title of "New and Old Economic Doctrines."</page><page sequence="24">538 Economic Doctrine ing out earthly Perfection in truth, beauty, and goodness, must be in operation, and that any one questioning such an assump- tion lacks faith and salvation. Fortunately, however, there has been in the past century a marked change in religious belief and in putative ways to salvation. It is even possible today to be devoutly religious and still to disavow the conception of Deity at the basis of classical preconceptions. Any one, in fact, who is consistently religious and at the same time scientific in a post- Darwinian sense must take a radically different view. For him, Evolution has been substituted for Perfection; Relativity in truth, beauty, and goodness, for Absolutism; Becoming for Being; Immanence for Transcendence; and experiment and control in human affairs for "letting things take their course," which has usually meant letting an unscrupulous minority take advantage of the pious majority. Such a theistic conception is not entirely new. It has been struggling for place, especially since the words of Paul, that "in Him we live and move and have our very being," gave man a claim upon divine inheritance and an inkling of his destiny to help fashion human affairs more in accord with the heart's desire. After the conservative-liberal controversies following I860, the more modern and scientific point-of-view has taken ever firmer hold until today, as one expression of it in the United States, there is projected a new program of planned democratic control in human affairs, to displace predatory exploitation by small minorities. That modern business competition is far from being "free," either on the side of demand or supply, is finally coming to be more fully recognized. Competition in matters economic there always was and doubtless always will be. But competition was of a decidedly predatory nature until modern social legislation (representing the forces of community co6peration) stepped in to "free" it somewhat of cave-man influences. Prize fighting was once more predatory than it is today. Marquess of Queens- berry rules have helped to make for a more equitable competition there. In a similar sense, co6perative action, in setting the rules of the economic game, lifts competition to a higher plane of freer and more equitable operation. In the economic and social revo-</page><page sequence="25">J. Mayer 539 lution through which the United States now appears to be pass- ing, a laudable effort is being made to formulate a still fairer code of business rules.81a The new emphasis upon human welfare, as against the old emphasis upon the inviolability of vested property holdings, is wholly in line with the dissipation of the misapprehension that utility, cost, and value have economic meaning only in terms of consumption, production, and exchange practices, whatever their character. When deliberate psychological appraisals, which the marginalists erroneously assume to have been constantly made in the past, actually come to be undertaken in any discerning manner, it is found that the real and the ideal are often poles apart and that a normative standard in terms of public benefit is urgently needed to render reasonably significant, terms that otherwise make economic nonsense. The focusing of attention upon the achievement and mainte- nance of a fairly invariable purchasing power and a reasonable standard of living for the different groups of a society, rather than upon the encouragement of further wild orgies of frenzied speculation under the guise of business prosperity booms, is another illustration of the more modern point of view.82 It inferentially repudiates the anachronistic assumption that we still live in a barter economy. As a matter of fact, even business men are not interested in an exchange of goods for goods, but rather in securing a net profit on their transactions; and, in their broader r61e of human beings, they are still less concerned with mechanical swapping operations. They are interested in ex- changing their services (given with a maximum of enjoyable effort) for sufficient purchasing power to maintain what they regard as a fair standard of living. The effort is often too painful 81a Cf., Edward H. Chamberlin, "The Theory of Monopolistic Competition," Har- vard University Press, Cambridge, I933; Joan Robinson, "The Economics of Imperfect Competition," Macmillan, New York, I933; C. J.

But at any rate these are the exchanges in which human beings are primarily interested-not in a crude, long-since- superseded barter of goods for goods.... Such is the inertia of long-standing social preconceptions, authoritatively promulgated, that in economic thinking, where the classical ideas have taken firmest hold, utility-disutility dogmas are still widely followed, when what we actually need are scientifically-drawn hypotheses about value (based upon an up-to-date knowledge of human nature) and about economic institutions (based upon realistic studies of their actual func- tioning), such as are already being formulated by a few private bureaus and institutes and latterly by the Federal government itself. 83 As it is, most economists appear to remain content with marginalism and its corollaries, even though some of them recog- nize that other ways of economic thinking have taken form. The many die-hards among the classicists and neo-classicists, though perhaps admitting certain logical and psychological short- comings in cost and utility theory, continue to insist that in the form of marginalism it nevertheless enjoys an indispensable probity and that it will not and should not totally disappear. It is presumed to possess "essential integrity," to bear a consid- erable "resemblance to the facts," and to be assured permanence through "its pedagogical compactness, its logical coherence and availability, and its large measure of pragmatic truth."84 It is one of the contentions of the present article that this "older economics" possesses integrity and is "logical" only on the score of pseudo-scientific assumptions and fallacious pre- conceptions, that for the most part it bears no resemblance at all to the facts of modern economic life, and that its very avail- ability and pedagogical compactness are a snare rather than a help in the training of future economists except possibly by way 83 Cf., R.

Should this appraisal be correct, even though certain historical achievements in eco- nomic analysis may be retained in their proper setting and some of them utilized in the projection of more adequate hypotheses, the classical structure as such, together with its neo-classical refinements, must be discarded in its entirety if a truly scientific approach to the problems of modern economic society is to be achieved.
