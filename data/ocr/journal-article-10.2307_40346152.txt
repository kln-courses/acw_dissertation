This paper studies bird-human reactions and feeding interactions in Peterborough, Ontario. It uses ecological survey methods, and also relies on alternative sources, including unique bird behaviours and 'strategies', intra-species differences and human emotions, preferences and feeding strategies. Feeders' presence attracted birds to non-habitat areas, altering the ecology of avian presence and foraging, and preferential feeding created serious, previously non-existent, inter-species conflicts and inventive, usually successful reactions from birds. There were inter-species, and in some cases intra-species, hierarchies of dominance, based on possible avian decisionmaking co-dependent with the human behaviours in the continually recreated and inflected spaces. This possibly anthropomorphic perspective of bird behaviour moves beyond established theories of adaptation and the relation of human-bird behavioural interactions to bird ecology. Key words: Peterborough, avian competition, animal geography, actant, recreation, foraging Introduction The adaptation of animals to human presence is currently a vital aspect of ecological research, due to drastic changes in habitats (Wolch and Emel 1998; Johnston et al. 2000; Philo and Wilbert 2000; White et al. 2005). Fundamentally, issues include species behaviour, and species size, speed, aggression and food preferences, as examined in animal ecology (Asdal 2003; Mavor et al. 2003; Traut and Hostetler 2004; Campbell 2006 2007). However, the integration of human and animal lives, within continually recreated, inflected and shared spaces, may require a deeper understanding of the possibility of jointly actant behaviour between animals and people (Haraway 1989 1994 2003; Asdal 2003). Crucially, several questions must be answered. Do the ecological sciences offer the flexibility to explore the subjectively individual and adaptive behaviours in an ever-changing, humanly created and inflected environment? Can we even explore animal behaviours as strategies, or expressions of individual hopes and fears, without the risk of excessive anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to animals? To what extent do the humanly created and continually modified spaces contribute to variable animal responses? How would the investigation of such issues contribute to an understanding of animal ecology? These questions are especially relevant, as human behaviour, a fundamental factor for adaptive animal behaviour, is often excluded from ecological studies, due to the frequent polarisation of natural and social science perspectives (Latour 1993; Johnston et al. 2000; Whatmore 1999 2002). Nevertheless, animal subjects may share active or 'actant' behaviour with people, these shared subjectivities being influ- enced by the generalisable, inter-species differences Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author.

Varieties of humanly created spaces may relate to animal behaviour, leading to questions of animal agency and its possible networks with people (Haraway 1989 1992b). These fundamental questions fall within the animal geography framework, which emphasises subjective agency of non-human animals, in relation to animal and human behaviour. Thus, animals may 'emerge as active agents fashioning the environment they inhabit . . . which bind them in different ways to people' (Johnston et al. 2000, 75). It may also explore more controversial topics such as humanist or anthropomorphic views on animal behaviour and the possible re-fashioning of methodologies for such studies. Dense urban areas, especially recreational areas, are relevant research areas, with increasingly intense animal-human contacts (Adams 1994; Philo and Wilbert 2000; Traut and Hostetler 2004; Campbell 2006 2007). Birds are generally the dominant urban animals, due to mobility and greater access to nesting and feeding spaces (Belant 1997; Blair 1996; Clergeau et al. 1998; Park and Lee 2000; Marzluff et al. 2001; Cooper 2002). A research design based on the integrative approach of animal geography is justified as: 1 birds increasingly occupy human recreational and consumption areas, scavenging and even influencing human movements and recreation; 2 people react variably to such bird behaviour, feeding, ignoring, threatening or even retreating from birds; and 3 both birds and people adapt to each other, in vari- able densities and land cover types, and they may be considered as subjective partners, sharing actant behaviour and even perhaps reactive tactics, strategies, fears and emotional experiences. This paper evaluates an animal geography approach to avian ecology, also testing the merits of a more anthropomorphic approach to animal behaviour, in relation to human presence and space modification. The case study examines bird competition for human- proffered food (HPF) in the riverine and urban parks of Peterborough, Ontario. Peterborough (44.30° N, 78.33° W, population 74 898; Statistics Canada 2006) is a small city with large forested and grassed parks, and mall parking lots on the Trent River, with recreational land use and avian foragers. In common with many North American and European cities, waterbirds and corvids are the dominant urban scavengers in Peterborough. These species, especially gulls, have been described as aggressively competitive, and adaptive to land cover change and human presence (Ankney et al. 1987; Bartelt 1987; Austin 1988; Moore and Switzer 1998; Hebert and McNeil 1999). Methods The study period was from 1 April to 1 August 2003. The research design sought to integrate an ecological field survey with a social survey, to derive data useful for an animal geography approach. Forty-eight bird-feeding occurrences were recorded in 12 locations in Peterborough, four in each of non-riverine concrete parks, non-riverine parks and riverbank locations. Non-riverine areas were about 500 metres (m) from the Trent River. Each feeding episode was observed for 30 minutes and was classified according to: (1) individual, intra- and inter-species bird behaviour; (2) bird numbers and comparative species density; and (3) the numbers and behaviour of the people. In each case at least five minutes of the pre- feeding and post-feeding periods were also observed to document bird behaviour in possible anticipation of feeding. Seven species of waterbirds and four terrestrial species were recorded at the feeding points, but only ring billed gulls, Canada geese, mallards and American crows were common enough to be included in the analysis. These species were also recorded in non-feeding situations (40 observation points for one hour each). A habitat survey recorded the dominant (70%) land cover around the recorded birds, and all bird species recorded within 20 m of the observer, to determine habitat preferences and explain avian presence in areas of human recreation. Intra- and inter-species flight distances were also measured, as the distance between the bird and the person when the bird took flight. Forty-two people (28 women and 14 men) in feeding episodes were observed and interviewed on bird and feeding preferences, any feeding strategies, reactions to bird behaviour, knowledge of bird intra- and inter-species differ- ences, and past experiences with bird feeding as a factor for park visitation. This survey was supported by observations of human actions, including feeding and reactions to bird behaviour. Human presence was also documented in relation to land cover, to determine the impact of human presence, behaviour and feeding on bird presence in different contexts.

Bird behaviour was measured by: 1 intra- and inter-species attacks which resulted in one bird retreating from its previous feeding space, dropping food, or having morsels pulled from the birds7 bills; 2 the chasing of one bird by another, on land, water or in flight; 3 physical attacks though wing-flapping and pecking; and 4 bird movements relative to people before, during and after food competition. Each species was also recorded in relation to the presence of other species, i.e. the number of one or more species in the presence or absence of one or more other species, and the ratio of species numbers. Individual bird behaviour was recorded by contrasting intra-species behaviour and reactions (flight, aggression and calling) to human behaviour. Patterns of inter- and intra-species behaviour were documented with particular emphasis on behaviour that obtained food through sequential activities. These included wing-flapping, pecking, chasing, dodging, hovering and manoeuvring around feeders. Individual birds were identified by plumage changes; dirty, missing and broken feathers; injuries; and size variation. Bird actions were recorded in pre-feeding periods, when birds appeared to anticipate feeding by gathering and observing human movements, the feeding period and the post-feeding period, when the birds either left or remained at vantage points. There was also statistical analysis, based on Microsoft Excel (Windows XP 2000) for regression and Pearson Product Moment correlations (one tailed, 0.05 level). The dependent variables were the number of birds and the number of each species. The independent variables were: the number of feeders, the distance of the feeders, the immediate land cover type (e.g. concrete, grass, shrubs, trees), the number of a second, third or fourth species, and the number of intra- and inter species conflicts and/or birds leaving and the flight distance in metres. Results The results of the study revealed three interesting issues, all of which contribute to the topic of animal agency and its variation in human-modified spaces. Firstly, different bird species varied in presence, according to both human presence and land cover. Ring-billed gulls, Canada geese, mallard ducks and American crows were the commonest avian scavengers recorded (Table 1). Others, such as starlings and rock doves did not congregate in sufficient numbers to be included in the analysis, and were much commoner in areas more than 30 m from the feeding points (83%). Gulls were recorded in all areas. Geese were absent from the concrete parks and commonest in riverbanks. Ducks were recorded in all areas, but were less common in the concrete parks. Crows were commonest in the non-riverine green spaces (Table 1). Concrete parks had the largest numbers of human visitors (44%) followed by riverine green spaces or riverbank (30%) and non-riverine green spaces Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author.

Birds were strongly associated with human, even non-feeding, presence (Table 2). Flight distances in relation to human proximity were longest in non-riverine green spaces (gulls 10.3 m, ducks 9.4 m, geese 8.8 m, crows 7.9 m) and shortest in concrete areas (gulls 2 m, crows 3.2 m, ducks 2 m). There were substantial intra-species differences between maximum and minimum flight distances (gulls 1 6.4 m, ducks 9 m, geese 11.3 m, crows 1 9.2 m). All feeding instances began with at least one duck within 3 m, followed by the rapid arrival of gulls and smaller number of crows, and in river areas, geese. All species had positive correlations, although leaving behaviour of ducks increased with aggressive behaviour of gulls and geese (Table 3). A second issue related to human feeding preferences and strategies. All feeders described ducks positively, while gulls and crows received only neutral or negative comments. Ducks were seen as the most attractive due to plumage colouration and their quacking calls were perceived as 'cute' and 'funny'. Gull and crow vocalisations were seen as more aggressive and 'pushy'. All species were seen as 'quite clever'. All respondents cited gulls as the smartest, arriving in 1-6 minutes, perching within sight of people, watching and circling when people opened bags (even for non-feeding purposes) and what appeared to be anticipatory circling and diving around people who moved their arms. Crows arrived up to 30 minutes later. Ducks (up to 30 m distant) swam towards people prior to feeding and remained along the bank even if the people left without feeding. In the riverine green areas and riverbanks, 70 per cent of the feeding began with ducks and the rest with geese. A human 'counter strategy' to the dominant strategies of gulls and geese (in reaction to preferential duck Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author.

This was initially successful in ten instances as ducks moved close (&lt;1 m). In at least nine cases, a duck took refuge between the feet of the feeder. However, within 3-5 minutes all the other birds moved closer and ducks were overpowered (geese on the ground, gulls on the ground and swooping close). Gull aggression included low, successful dives to remove non-proffered food from people's hands, two incidents of aerial defecation on human clothes, and six of flapping about people's heads. Only in the case of flapping did one gull employ the same methods twice. In seven cases, the aggressive behaviour of gulls towards the deliberately fed ducks contributed to people leaving the feeding area (nine women and three men). These people described gull behaviour as threatening, and cited this as a factor for their preference of ducks. A third important issue was the inter-species behavioural change in relation to human presence and feeding. There were three bird behaviours that could represent actant agency, or even strategies: 1 individualism in species-level behaviour; 2 changes in behaviour in reaction to human feeding strategies, by both favoured and non-favoured species; and 3 pre- and post-feeding behaviour, including increased bird presence on the ground, water or branches. All these actions took place in three main areas: 1 the immediate location of the dropped food; 2 the general range of the thrown food around the feeder; and 3 outside this range, as many birds behaved as opportunistic spectators. All aggressive actions between birds were observed in human presence: away from human presence, only quiet foraging or perching was observed. Over 40 per cent of birds were spectators, with half competing when opportunities arose. The strongest competition was between gulls and geese on the river surface. In all cases, the inter- species conflicts began as people approached and birds appeared to prepare to snatch food. These conflicts increased after food was cast, and moved over the surface as more food was thrown and broken up. Birds moved closer to people as they consumed the food, as if anticipating more food. Sixty-two conflicts were recorded, with gulls obtaining the contested food in 26 cases (all by taking to flight, as geese never flew in pursuit) and geese in 22. The gulls in such instances appeared to match their flight with thrown food, to snatch it before it fell on the water. In other cases, the morsel was shared after being broken up. In 60 per cent of these incidents, the aggressive grouping of geese forced the gulls to compete by hovering and diving at opportunities, rather than floating. These actions by geese were strongly individual, as three geese were the main belligerents and more than 70 per cent watched quietly. In 82 per cent of the goose/gull conflicts, the food was initially nearer a duck or had actually been picked up by a duck, and was either dropped or abandoned under a goose and/or gull attack. In such cases, gulls prevailed in 21 cases and geese in 16. The individual aggression of the gulls and geese (pecking, flapping and calling) appeared to be the main decider. Ducks obtained only 32 per cent of the food pieces, even when feeders targeted them. In these instances, ducks were either particularly aggressive or fast at food collection. The number of ducks was negatively correlated with the number of gulls and geese (Table 3). These were weak correlations, as duck-leaving behaviour was highly individual and at least a third of ducks returned or waited within 10 m. Ducks prevailed in only 7 per cent of the conflicts with gulls and 6 per cent of those with geese. There were 13 duck-duck conflicts: one duck prevailed in seven, and in three a goose broke up the fight and prevailed over the combatants. In 12 feeding instances in the river surface, where people dropped food closer to their position (to protect ducks) the conflicts moved onto the bank, and towards the human feeder (either seated or standing). Some gulls and geese pushed ducks aside, and others pecked their backs and also flapped at them, increasing duck leaving. Larger numbers of ducks had no significant effects on the other species (Table 3). No crows were involved in the conflicts, but in 12 incidents crows sat on the grass and/or branches within 10 m of the feeding, perhaps waiting for opportunities. In four incidents crows flew within 2 m of the food conflict on the water's surface. On the bank gulls prevailed in the single conflict between two crows and three gulls. There were also four incidents where gulls chased crows in flight, beyond the observer's field of vision. In non-riverine green areas, gulls also dominated. Gulls and ducks foraged quietly, but human presence Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author.

Increased gull presence and aggression resulted in duck leaving, but only in five feeding instances did geese drive ducks away. There were also fewer conflicts between gulls and geese (16). Geese appeared slower on land than water, with gulls snatching food closer to geese in 31 cases. In five incidents where the food fell within 60 cm of a goose, the goose prevailed by flapping wings and calling, and in one case engaging in a tug of war with the gull. Two conflicts were recorded between crows and ducks, with one victory each and six between crows and gulls, with gulls prevailing in five. There were also 62 intra-species fights (gulls 41, ducks 12, geese 7, and crows 2). A third of these fights were between two to four identified birds. In the concrete parks, the gulls were dominant over both ducks and crows. Fifty-eight conflicts were recorded between gulls and ducks, with gulls prevailing in 41 and the rest resulting in shared morsels. Gulls and crows participated in 17 inter- species conflicts, with all favouring the gulls. Seven involved gulls diving on feeding crows. In these areas, feeders targeted both ducks (10) and gulls (4), but not crows. This targeting was only successful in about 30 per cent of food tosses, as gulls actively hovered, and intervened and obtained the food in the remainder of cases. Duck leaving behaviour was significantly correlated with gull numbers (Table 3). In three feeding instances, ducks took refuge near (&lt;1 m) the feeders, under a gull onslaught. Individual gulls exhibited extreme aggression in pecking ducks, flapping wings, dragging morsels from their bills and even hovering around human feeders. Crows perching up to 20 m were also attacked and pursued by gulls in the incident. Discussion The three issues illustrated in the results are important contributions to knowledge on bird behaviour and the possibilities of an animal geography approach. These issues may be evaluated by the extent to which they detail and illustrate the specific kinds of decisionmaking and co-dependent behaviour of both birds and people. We may also examine the differences that people make through presence, and the modification of shared animal-human spaces. How do these issues, illustrated in the findings of this paper, contribute to our understanding of agency between birds (near to and apart from people) and people/human modified spaces? And how does this study illustrate the field situation of the animal geographer, as a person with a perspective requiring more critical perceptions of animal and human behaviour, and the evaluation of both of these dynamics? A key question concerns the extent to which this study, based on a critical field approach, has shown a way beyond the vocabulary of behavioural adaptation and even opportunism, opening a vision of more subjective bird behaviour, co-dependent with human actions. The evidence for such behaviour could possibly be seen in three groups of instances: 1 the waiting behaviour of some birds, which appeared to include hope of success, risk-taking and fear of failure; 2 the individualism of such behaviour, which was at both inter- and intra-species levels; and 3 the links between this behaviour and the variations in human behaviour and the opportunities created in the feeding spaces. These may be examined within the context of the three main issues emerging from the results: 1 avian presence variation according to human presence and land cover; 2 the importance of human perceptions and human feeding strategies; and 3 the relation between human behaviour and bird reactions. Concerning the first issue, variable inter-species presence illustrated the role of human presence in the creation of spaces, and the relation of this to avian land cover preferences. However, the evidence in the current study of anticipatory bird behaviour allows exploration of more subjective factors for bird presence. The 'natural' foraging habitats could be considered as the riverbanks under dense vegetation with a few clearings. While all species were recorded in such areas, far more were recorded on open lawns, concrete parks, rooftops and sidewalks, even in the absence of feeding humans. The human presence attracted birds to concrete areas, from which they might otherwise be absent. This was despite the nature of the HPF, which arguably was not a 'natural' food. Here, flight distances were also minimal, possibly due to the perception of people as feeders, rather than predators (Lima and Zollner 1996; Fernandez-Juricic et al. 2001; Campbell 2006). Such species-level variations have been noted elsewhere (Park and Lee 2000; Mavor et al. 2003; Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author. Journal compilation © Royal Geographical Society (with The Institute of British Geographers) 2008</page><page sequence="7">478 Campbell Traut and Hostetler 2004; White et al. 2005). Although some birds foraged for insects in mowed lawns, this describes an avian attraction to human- dominated spaces as foraging areas. Thus human presence changed possible land cover, however barren, into feeding areas. Direct human presence also changed species behaviour: ducks took refuge near people when under gull attack, gulls became more aggressive, crows more observant and geese and ducks moved closer. The production of spaces for avian 'feeding actants' was also closely related to human recreational and resting preferences. The attraction may have resulted from the birds' memories of past feedings, evidenced by the approaches made to people going through pre- feeding motions (e.g. hand motions). The human interest in feeding, partly conditioned by the attraction of cute ducks, would also serve as a factor for bird behaviour. May these be interpreted as representative of the birds' strategies (by appearing at these areas) or even hopes (anticipation of human actions) of food? The individualised, anticipatory actions of birds give ample ground for such an argument. From an ecological perspective, this may be considered learned behaviour, but from the perspective of this paper it might also be considered overly dependent, possibly 'sad addiction' to easily accessible, artificial, low nutrient foods. May this perspective, hinting at a value judgement on bird behaviour, also illustrate the importance of an actant-based approach, with actual implications for ecology (e.g. later health problems for birds)? This may illustrate how obser- vation of human movements and bird reactions may document a specific type of linked decisionmaking and co-dependent, subjectively derived behaviour. This also assesses land cover as more than a physical feature, with the human element embedded within 'strategic' planning on the part of the birds. Humans therefore directly and indirectly made sufficient differences for such interlinked dynamics to be con- sidered as important considerations in bird ecology. The humanly created spaces introduce subjectivity to ecological relations, which require a greater use of human-related research than is common in eco- logical research (Asdal 2003; Mavor et al. 2003; Traut and Hostetler 2004; Campbell 2006 2007). Concerning the second issue, human behaviour, perceptions and feeding strategies, there was strong co-dependence with birds, networked through the reciprocal animal-human interactions. Direct human presence changed the spaces for birds, this being manifested by the increased presence of observant birds (perching, hovering, swimming and even diving) with human arrival, arm movements, sitting and standing, even when no food was forthcoming. The preference for feeding ducks also increased inter- species conflicts, which might not have occurred if gulls or even geese were preferred. Therefore, in terms of 'bird-bird' behaviour in human presence, aggressive encounters began and increased markedly, and a hierarchy of dominance absent in human absence emerged (gulls generally at the top, then crows and geese, lastly ducks). Indirectly, foraging spaces were expanded, as grassed lawns, concrete spaces and river banks were created as major foraging areas, albeit 'pulling' birds towards food of possibly lower nutrient value, with avian presence sometimes persisting after feeding instances. Hence, the people made marked differences for bird behaviour, both directly through their presence and indirectly through the creation and inflection of the localised environ- mental contexts. The findings of the social survey make a contribution to the understanding of both inter- and intra-species bird behaviour (within and without human presence) and the definition of agency, because they document the shared role of birds and humans in the creation of spaces of human pleasure and strategic thinking, bird foraging, competition, reactions and capabilities. The spaces exhibited fluidity and values, changing the perceptions of both birds and people, unlike the depiction of foraging habitats in the ecological literature (e.g. Wolch and Emel 1998; Jokimaki 1999; Marzluff et al. 2001; Vuorisalo et al. 2003). Concerning the third issue, species behavioural change in relation to human presence and feeding, there were interesting findings. These illustrated co-dependent behaviour between people and birds, sharing behaviours aimed at a result (for the people, selective feeding of birds, with exclusion of some others; for birds, overcoming these strategies). The failure of people to consistently achieve selective feeding testifies to the successful actions of the birds. May the birds' actions be explored as strategies, based on their hopes, decisions and fears? Based on the results of this study, the answer would be a qualified 'yes'. The gulls' strategies (hovering, mid- air piracy, diving, flapping and perched observation) were frequently successful, and were attempted even on non-feeding people, and to a greater extent on ducks than the stronger geese. These therefore appeared to be learned responses, based on 'hope' of success. The ducks' responses (taking refuge near feeders, short retreats or leaving the scene) were also Area Vol. 40 No. 4, pp. 472-480, 2008 ISSN 0004-0894 © The Author. Journal compilation © Royal Geographical Society (with The Institute of British Geographers) 2008</page><page sequence="8">An animal geography of avian feeding habits 479 successful in many instances, especially when people altered their focus to reflect the ducks' movements. Where ducks moved very close to people, or moved away from gulls and thus influenced people to throw food over gulls at the moving ducks, it may be argued that the ducks were creating new spaces of foraging, based on the hope of a response from the people, and fear of gull attack. In this sense, it may be argued that the behaviours of people and ducks represented strategies and shared hopes, as each attempted to create spaces of mutual benefit (pleasurable feeding for humans, food for ducks) in the face of imaginative interception by gulls. Within this co-dependence, may we also see duck behaviour as overly dependent, even pathetically so, on a few pieces of stale bread, this giving a value judgement of anthropomorphic dimensions? This may go beyond the classic definition of ecological adaptation (Lima and Zollner 1996; Fernandez-Juricic et al. 2001; Mavor et al. 2001; Campbell 2006), and arguably qualify birds as actants, or an agent adapting to options (Murdoch 1998). Actant status may imply deliberate actions, rather than chance opportunism (Haraway 1989 1992b; Wolch and Emel 1998; Whatmore 1999 2002). Both descriptions may apply to the behaviour of birds in this study, as repetitive patterns of behaviour and individual initiatives were both recorded, these being related to inter- and intra- species, shared bird-human, and human behaviour. Conclusions An animal geography approach, as designed in this study, uncovers important issues and makes an incisive, human-oriented and exploratory contribution to urban avian ecology. May this animal geography approach, which in this study combined a classical ecological study with a movement into largely uncharted territory of a more anthropomorphic perspective, make a positive contribution to avian ecology? Based on the results of this study, the answer would be 'yes'. The results support the initial position that an exploration of subjective bird behaviour and a greater study of its interconnectedness and co-dependent association with humans develop the understanding of avian ecology, possibilities of animal agency, and the implications of a more anthropomorphic view of bird behaviour. In agreement with the purpose of the paper, the findings also support the approach of avian ecology as an important background to clarify the more subjective issues uncovered by animal geography. Intra-species behaviour is important, despite the greater emphasis in the literature on avian inter- species behaviour. Where statistical generalisation is used, 'minority' behaviour is also important. Increasingly subjective and dynamic environments, humanly created and inflected, produce spaces of active animal responses, and these may be interconnected with human behaviour. Human behaviour cannot be separated from such contexts, due to shared sub- jectivities and actant behaviour with animals, and further examination of people in such contexts may therefore be an important aspect of ecology. It may also be possible to examine bird behaviour both positive (the achievement actant status and beneficial adaptation) and negative (over-dependence on HPF, despite natural alternatives), allowing the anthropo- morphic approach to touch on value issues. These findings also illustrate the utility of a broad field appraisal, from the perspective of animal geography, as fundamental contributor to ecological research. Animal ecology may therefore be re-examined through multiple lenses of appraisal, providing the basis for further developments. Multi-species studies including contrasting species (e.g. ducks and corvids) may be expanded to include the subjectivities of less human-tolerant species. Human avoidance may also be a form of actant behaviour; as such species compete for spaces with less human occupation. Individual birds of one or more species may also be tracked using more sophisticated techniques and studied as single behaviourally contrasted actants. Studies of rural to urban gradients may also include more natural environments, such as dense old forest. These approaches may open a new but important rethink of the relationship between the ecological, conservation and social sciences.
