<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Rites and Ritual in the Time of Uruk IV - III. By E. Douglas Van Buren (Rome). Religious rites go back far beyond the dawn of history into the very early days of the human race, but how early a ritual was evolved cannot be precisely ascertained. As soon as religious rites became a constant or recurrent practice the need must have arisen to regulate and formulate the conduct of the ceremonies so that everything should be done "decently and in order". In Mesopotamia before the days when such matters were inscribed on clay tablets the only records of such ceremonies that have come down to us are those works of art which depict scenes of religious rites 1. Each of them exhibits one or more phases of a ceremony, and in certain cases the formal arrangement of the figures, or an action repeated on more than one monument, implies a preordained sequence of acts which was followed scrupulously every time that the rite was performed. The pictographic tablets deposited in the l0pfer$tätteri found in the Eanna precinct at Uruk in Stratum III c and III b, as well as the tablet with a parallel text found in an 4 Opfertrog ' of Stratum II 2, all give lists of offerings in precisely the same order, thus testifying that the sacrifices were always carried out in the same way in accordance with an established rule. It has been argued that before the Early Dynastic period worship in Mesopotamia was entirely aniconic; symbols of divinities were known and revered, but superhuman power was concentrated in the male and female principles, and the deity was never conceived in anthro- pomorphic form3. Yet certain facts seem to contradict that hypothesis. Tepe Gaura has shown that temples with a ground-plan carefully worked out in every detail existed at a remote age, and the three temples grouped round a main court on the acropolis of Stratum XIII, "which belongs definitely to the Obeid period" 4, imply that at that period there were at least three distinct divine beings, each one with his own particular cult. If the people of Gaura XIII worshipped three divinities simultaneously they must have passed far beyond the aniconic stage of the worship of the male and female principles, and have endowed each of their deities with a separate personality; in other words, .they envisaged the gods in anthropomorphic form. In the time of Uruk IV and III temples were erected which were regarded as the 'house' of the god5; offerings were brought to them in the same way and of the same kind as tribute to an earthly ruler. They wore garments and ornaments like mortal men, for a girdle was brought for the male divinity and a sumptuous necklace for the goddess 6. On certain monuments a number of sheep and cattle are grouped together; they are too numerous to be victims brought for a sacrifice, and must represent the sacred flocks and herds belonging *) My thanks for permission to publish the photographs illustrating this article are due to: Professor Dr. Walter Andrae, Direktor der Vorderasiatischen Abteilung, Staatliche Museen, Berlin; M. le Professeur Dr. Louis Delaporte, Paris; Miss Belle Greene, Librarian of the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York; Dr. Ernst Heinrich and the Members of the Warka Expedition; Edward Th.

Van Buren, Religious Rites and Ritual in the Time of Uruk IV - III. 83 to a deity, especially as they are often shown gathered round or issuing from a byre 7. On pictographic tablets gods were typified by their symbols 8, and the very fact that Innin, the protectress of flocks, could be typified by the gate-post with a streamer or Ningirsu by his mace presupposes that at that time the gods had sufficiently well-defined personalities to render those symbols appropriate to them. The argument: "Die verdoppelte Darstellung der Göttin als Menschenwesen und als Symbol wäre unwahrscheinlich" 9, sounds irrefutable. But in religious matters men do not always reason logically, and, in later times at any rate, gods were often represented together with their symbols or attributes. It has been argued very convincingly that in Mesopotamian religion the anthropomorphic image preceded the symbol: "Par le simple fait de l'évolution religieuse et probablement sans qu'on doive s'exa- gérer l'importance des transformations ethniques introduisant une théodicée nouvelle, un moment devait arriver où l'anthropomorphisme à la fois naïf et touchant des origines paraîtrait indigne des dieux célestes, inutiles d'ailleurs, puisque des insignes et des symboles à peu près figés depuis tant de siècles leur donnaient une personnification suffisante . . . En ce stade religieux, l'art ne pouvait que s'abstenir d'images qui semblaient minimiser les grands dieux; il les rendra donc désormais sensibles de préférence par des attributs et des symboles en attendant de n'y plus employer qu'un symbole parfois transparent, le plus souvent si modifié qu'il ne garde pas grand'chose de sa figure originelle" 10. May we not conclude that in very early times the gods were conceived in purely human form, but certain objects or animals were regarded as their symbols or attributes and could, in given circumstances, represent them? In that case the symbol was believed to embody the deity, and therefore reverence was paid to it as to the god himself. But if the divinity and the symbol were both represented at the same time, then the symbol was no longer the embodiment of the divinity, but was relegated to its original status as a material object which was in some way especially appro- priate to the god and was an essential element in his worship. The great alabaster vase discovered at Warka was carved in relief on the exterior with zones of decoration, each one somewhat narrower than the one above it, and all illustrat- ing some phase of a religious ceremony described as the presentation of offerings in the temple Eanna (Fig. 1) n. The vase was itself a cult vessel and must have been one of a pair, for a fragment still exists which was evidently a portion of an exact counterpart 12. Below the zones carved in relief wavy lines indicating water stream round the vase; immediately above them a big ear of corn alternating with a palm-tree covers all the surface of the zone decorated in relief which is separated by a narrow plain band from a zone illustrating maned sheep, a ram and a ewe alternately, walking round the vase. Plain zones isolate the vegetable and animal spheres from that of the human beings, a procession of nude priests, each one bearing in both hands either a bowl probably containing milk or some other liquid offering, or an jar for oil, or a basket piled with fruits. Another plain area is crowned with the widest and uppermost zone of decoration; in it a pair of big gate-posts with streamers indicates the entrance to the sanctuary, and in front of them is a female figure wearing a long plain robe and a head-covering with a horn-like peak in front and rear; she receives the basket containing fruit and ears of corn offered by a nude priest. A remarkable subject is depicted behind the gate-posts, that is, properly speaking, within the sanctuary because the rings of the gate-posts are always attached 011 the outer side. Figures of two maned sheep are 7) BM 120000, VA 8768, Andrae, Berliner Museen LI, 1930, SS. 2 - 4, Abb. 1-3; AO 8842, Contenau, Antiq. Or.

Douglas Van Buren represented as if advancing side by side, bearing on their backs an architectonic support in two stages, the lower one bounded by a gate-post of Innin. On each of the two stages stands a figure with unbound hair; they are thought to be male because their long skirts are girded, whereas women at that time do not seem to have worn belted garments; one clasps his raised wrist with his other hand in a ritual gesture, the other holds an object which has been identified on pictographic tablets as the sign en. Behind them are two immense baskets heaped high with fruit and vegetables, and close to them there are a bull's head and ritual objects. Up above, two stone vessels and two dishes on low stands can be seen, as well as two vases in the shape of a gazelle and a lion. There is, unfortunately, a break beyond the figure of the nude priest, but immediately behind him there must have been another figure facing in the same direction to right, for his foot and the lower part of his skirt are preserved; the end of his long girdle of woven stuff finished off with two tassels is held by another figure with long, unbound hair who wears a skirt reaching to just above his knees. That the object held by the attendant is a girdle is proved by a cylinder seal from Tell Billa showing a nude priest carrying to a temple a similar girdle of woven stuff, but with one tassel only at each end13. The subject as a whole is unusual, but parallels can be adduced for almost all the details. Similar theriomorphic vases are pictured on other monuments together with cult objects of the same kind as those shown on the vase 14, and animal figurines, hollowed out to serve as a receptacle for liquids, have been found at Warka and elsewhere 15. Other examples are known of an animal supporting on its back a zikkurrat-like structure surmounted by one or more symbolic gate-posts with streamers, and in one instance a figure just like those on the vase stands on the summit of the construction 16. The stone cult vessels depicted resemble the alabaster vase in shape, except that they have a higher foot. The same arrangement of cult objects in a sanctuary indicated by gate-posts with streamers is shown on the seal now in Dresden and a fragmentary seal from Warka already mentioned. On the first a bearded figure, holding out a theriomorphic vase in the shape of an antelope, advances towards two stone vases, two «dishes on high feet, a second theriomorphic vase in the form of a gazelle, and two baskets heaped so high with offerings that the fruit spills over and falls to the ground. Still preserved on the second example are an immense basket, two stone vessels on high bases, and a theriomorphic vase in the shape of a crane (Fig. 2) 17. The fact that there were always two stone vases, two dishes, two baskets filled with fruit, and two theriomorphic vases suggests that the offerings were not brought for Innin alone, but for her consort also. The pairing conception is, indeed, brought out by the whole scheme of decoration. In the lowest zone, above the life-giving flowing water, a palm-tree typifying the female divinity alternates with a great ear of corn symbolic of the male deity. The same alternation can be seen on a fine pear-shaped mace-head, IM 22788, where three ears of corn alternate with three palm-trees (Fig. 3). In the second zone of the vase a maned ram alternates with a ewe. The female figure who receives the offerings has been described as a priestess imper- sonating the goddess18; but Dr. Heinrich himself notes that she wears a horned head-dress such as is worn by the female figure on a crudely cut cylinder seal from Warka19, and she raises her right hand in a gesture which is identical with that made by the gods in the later scenes of introduction. Her garment, a heavy mantle which folds over in front, is of a type 13) Speiser, BASOR 46, 1932, p. 5; Andrae, Ionische Säule , S. 39 f., Tf. IV, c. ") Heidenreich, ZA XLI, 1933, SS. 200-8, Tf.

These considerations, her position in front of the sacred symbols, and the evidence afforded by other monuments to be discussed later, lead to the conclusion that the goddess in person is portrayed21. The fragmentary figure and the attendant are depicted sufficiently often on cylinder seals to leave no doubt that the former represented a bearded man whose long hair did not hang down unbound, but was rolled up at the nape of his neck and kept in place by a head- band, like the hair of the gods of later periods. He wore a skirt of loosely woven transparent material which was wrapped round him in such a way that one end was brought over in front as far as the left hip, and then formed a straight line from that point to the bottom of the cloth and along the lower line of the skirt. Dr. Moortgat calls attention to the continuity of tradition demonstrated by the striking similarity between the appearance of this bearded figure and that of the god Ningirsu on the Stele of the Vultures: the bare upper part of the body, the skirt with wide border girt round the waist, the hair rolled up at the nape of the neck and kept in place by a head-band 22. Evidently this was the dress of a divinity, for in the time of Uruk IV and III men were clad in quite other fashion. Moreover, the mature figure is sometimes drawn on a bigger scale than the other figures. The evidence, indeed, seems to suggest that he is intended to represent the consort of the goddess who was, however, of humbler status than she was. Every detail of his appearance is clearly rendered on the Dresden seal where he holds out a theriomorphic vase in the shape of an antelope, and is followed by the short-skirted attendant with long hair who carries a jar for oil or for libations. A pair of gate-posts with streamers indicates that the scene is laid in a sanctuary of Innin 23. A marble cylinder seal, partly broken at the top, represents a temple with double doors approached by the divine consort clad in his transparent skirt; he holds up a dangling lion-cub. After him comes the young long-haired attendant wearing a short skirt; he holds at arm's length a great necklace. Behind them two of the sheep of Innin stand between ears of corn, emblematic of the male divinity (Fig. 4) 24. It is possible that here the necklace and the little lion are gifts offered by the bridegroom in person. On another seal, only half of which is preserved, the same two figures, both carrying immense ears of corn, enter the sanctuary of Innin25. The bearded figure and his youthful attendant, clad in their character- istic apparel, appear in certain scenes illustrating the feeding of the sacred flocks of sheep and herds of cattle 2C. The sheep they feed with ears of corn typifying the god, the kine with rosette-blossoms symbolic of the goddess. Another example from Warka gives all the details of the costume of the bearded figure and the arrangement of his hair and beard with careful precision, but this time he stands in the middle of a boat, and is screened off from the man in the stern, who is occupied with the paddle, by a stand or construction of trellis-work 27 . In the prow of the boat a nude attendant kneels behind a bull supporting on his back a construc- tion crowned with gate-posts with streamers. The boat itself has the unusual feature that at the prow and stern it burgeons into big lotus-like buds. The composition seems to illustrate a passage by water from one temple to another. Here the divine consort proceeds by water, accompanied by ritual objects, from his own temple to that of the goddess, evidently as a prelude to the celebration of the sacred marriage for which everything is prepared. The bridegroom is attired in festive array, and, as a presage of the marriage, the accomplishment of which will confer fertility upon all the people, the boat bearing him blossoms forth into leaves and flowers.

A sequence of episodes picturing the meeting of the goddess and her consort are crudely cut on a series of cylinder seals which all seem to be from Warka. Yet their derivation from the fine style is clear from a seal, Monserrat No. 15, which shows the bearded god clad in the traditional dress and holding up his ear of corn; he is within the sanctuary and is accompanied by the goddess, while in front of them are two stone vessels and two baskets for offerings (Fig. 5). A limestone seal reveals the goddess wearing the horned headdress and heavy mantle just as she does on the alabaster vase; she stands at the entrance to her temple, and grasps the long streamer of the gate-post as she gazes with eager expectancy towards her bridegroom who advances, holding in his hand his own symbol of an enormous ear of corn. He wears a head-band and the prescribed skirt of loosely woven stuff. In the background are two baskets for offerings (Fig. 6) 29. Another seal depicts the same scene, but it is more crudely rendered. The goddess, wearing her horned head-dress, seizes the streamer of the gate-post and looks forth from the temple to welcome the god who advances, holding up with both hands the ear of corn, here reduced to a knob upon a stick; the two 28) The Ear of Corn : Analecta Orientalia XII, 1935, pp. 327 - 35; Deimel, Orientalia , N.

Douglas Van Buren baskets are placed in the background (Fig. 7) 30. The deities are both within the sanctuary, and both wear a garment made of loosely woven material on another seal; the two baskets are placed between them31. On the crudest of all the seals the same scene is merely traced in outline32, but the horned head-dress of the goddess is clearly indicated. She appears to welcome her consort who stands with folded hands, almost in an attitude of humility. The biggest seal of the series exhibits what is perhaps the last episode of the rite 33. The goddess, wearing the peaked head-dress and a garment with criss-cross lines, stands at the temple doorway holding the streamer of the gate-post; her consort has already crossed the threshold and walks away from her and past the two baskets, holding aloft a gigantic ear of corn. The bearded figure is portrayed on other monuments, a late version being given on the smaller of the two Blau monuments where he holds up a theriomorphic vase in the shape of an antelope 34 ; in the register below him a nude priest kneeling upon one knee is engaged in an occupation which is delineated more clearly on the reverse of the larger tablet where two nude men in the same crouching attitude are both intent upon holding with both hands a long-handled implement with which they stir or pound something in a vessel. In the back- ground another man, seated on a low stool, performs a similar task. Between him and the other men there is a figure who seems to have some affinity with the youthful attendant, for he wears a skirt of loose-meshed stuff with a plain border, but his head is shaven like that of the priests. He raises his clasped hands to the level of his chin in a gesture of reverence. This gesture is repeated on the obverse of the same tablet by a figure clad in a belted skirt whose thick hair is cut in a line with the nape of his neck. In this humble attitude he gazes submissively across an intervening column of text towards the bearded figure of the divine consort who holds upright a thick sceptre-like rod by grasping it with one hand at each end. This seems to be a ceremony of initiation, and it may be compared with the more striking scene of anointing on a fragmentary piece from Kish depicting a temple and before it the bearded figure, this time wearing a short skirt (for here he is not shown as a bridegroom), who pours water or oil upon the head of a somewhat smaller figure with a girded skirt and thick short hair who raises both hands in a gesture of reverence (Fig. 8) 35. An enigmatic seal impression from the archaic Stratum IV in the Eanna precinct at Uruk is obscure because the explanatory details are now obliterated36. Perhaps the two foregoing seals may serve to interpret it as a scene of initiation, for the figures of the divine consort and the man opposite him clad in a shorter skirt are repeated. This time they are in the proximity of a temple, of which the lateral elevation only is shown because the spectator is supposed to be looking from the side towards the centre of interest, the bearded figure who has just issued from the sanctuary. Another scene is represented on various fragments of a seal impression which in its present condition is suggestive rather than decisive 37. The bearded figure, wearing head-band and half-long skirt, is posed majestically leaning upon a reversed spear to one side of the composition; he takes no part in the action, for when he commands it is for others to carry out his orders. Several nude figures, with their arms bound behind them and their knees trussed up so that they are in a crouching position, are scattered in the field and their captors stands over them. One man, however, turns to the god and raises both hands in reverence, as if to announce to the deity that his behest has been obeyed, and the wicked have been punished.

A fragmentary relief of fine-grained white limestone is carved with extraordinary skill (Fig. 9) 38. The style of the carving, the modelling of the figures, and details of the garments bear witness to its affinity with the alabaster vase from Warka; they are, indeed, so alike in every particular that one is tempted to think that they were the work of the same sculptor. Only a small portion of the relief now remains, but it is enough to prove that it was divided into at least two registers of unequal height. The upper one reveals the lower limbs of two figures moving to right. One of them wore a long skirt, the legs of the other were bare. They approach a figure with a long robe who was evidently seated upon a throne, for the bare ankle and foot disclosed below the garment rest upon a footstool supported on the head of a reclining sheep with a long thick fleece. Very little of the lower register is preserved; on the left are the head and shoulders of a nude priest and his two hands holding some object. He was turned to left and behind him there was a slab like a picture or tapestry with the figure of a goat incised upon it; it is impossible to tell what was represented on the right, for that side of the relief is badly damaged. This fragment must have been part of a very beautiful and important work of art. What little remains seems to represent a nude priest approaching an enthroned deity, while he is followed by a clothed figure, possibly that of the divine consort, for his skirt is not smooth like that of the seated figure, but the little incised lines on it suggest that it was of rough or hairy stuff. A fine seal of black diorite presents a boldly cut composition 39. A temple with double doors stands on the banks of a river on which there is a boat, and this boat, like the one on the seal from Warka, has burst into flowers and foliage at the prow and stern. In it are two men, one standing and plying a punting pole, the other seated and rowing with an oar. Above them another nude man with outstretched arm stands apparently in the air. It has been thought that he was a passenger standing in the boat, but it seems more likely that he was a priest of the temple standing on the river bank to direct the movements of the boat. From the right three figures approach the temple. The first and third are nude priests; the first carries the immense necklace of the bride, the other displays the woven girdle of her consort. A young man walks between them holding some object in front of him with both hands. He wears a short skirt of loose-meshed stuff rolled over at the waist to keep it in place. This scene from Tell Billa seems to reveal a late episode in the drama of the sacred marriage; the god has been transported in his boat to the temple with double doors where the marriage took place; the attendants display the distinctive apparel of the divine pair to intimate that the union has been accomplished. In this case it was presumably the god who was the principal figure in the rite, for the doors of the temple are flanked by his symbols, two posts, the upper parts of which are embellished with three pairs of rings. Professor Andrae has sought to prove that this post with its pairs of rings signifies the union of the male and female principle, the fusion of the two elements into one whole40. But on other occasions this symbol rises above the byre in which cattle are herded (Fig. 10) 41, bulls being sacred to a male divinity, in contradistinction to the huts in which sheep were penned which were surmounted by the gate-posts with streamers of Innin, to whom the flocks were consecrated42. A pair of these symbols were inlaid on a libation jug of bituminous limestone found in the deposit of votive offerings discovered in Stratum III of the Eanna precinct at Warka43. Apparently it was a matter of indifference whether two or three pairs of rings were attached to the upper part of the shaft, for on the cylinder seal from Khafaje the two posts above the doors of the byre «s) IM 4325. 39) Speiser, BASOR 46, 1932, p. 5; Andrae, Ionische Säule, SS. 23, 29 - 42, Tf.

Douglas Van Buren have two pairs of rings, whereas the bigger post rising above the middle of the roof has three pairs of rings. This symbol was used as a sign on pictographic tablets of Uruk IV44, and the longevity of the conception is demonstrated by a stele of G-udea on which what is perhaps a later version of the symbol is set up on each side of what might be a schematized shrine or tabernacle 45. This symbol was found in the precinct of Eanna, but like the gate-post with a streamer of Innin herself it has never as yet been discovered in the area of the Anu zikkur- rat. Thus the evidence seems to imply that the post with pairs of rings was the symbol of a male divinity whose cult was honoured in the EOanna precinct and who was worshipped also at Khafaje and Tell Billa, and possibly at Lagaš in late times. The cylinder seal from Khafaje is important, for it was found in the temple of the Moon-god Sin. A remarkable cylinder seal depicts a deity standing in the doorway of a temple to which access was obtained by a flight of step« between broad parapets; a high post with a ring attached to one side near the top is planted to one side of the temple entrance (Fig. 11) 46. This ringed post is the so-called 4 Bügelschaff or 'huckled spear'. But it was not originally a spear, for its exact form is known. At Lagaš, to north-west of the edifice of Ur-Nanse and lying on an earlier pavement in front of a wall, M. de Sarzec found the copper sheathing of a ringed post, 3.27 m. in length, which must originally have stood at the door of a temple 47. On the seal the deity, who is rather sketchily portrayed, wears a long robe and extends both arms laterally with open hands in a gesture of acceptance or of welcome to the man who approaches, driving one heron before him and carrying a second in his arms. He is not nude, for the criss-cross pattern of his transparent skirt can be seen across his legs, and it was kept in place by a double girdle round his waist. On a seal in the Louvre the post with a ring attached laterally rises above the roof of a hut around which cattle are gathered, and a pair of these posts flank the entrance to a byre from which calves emerge on a seal impression of the archaic Stratum IV at Uruk 48. A pair of them are stationed at the door of a temple on a curious cylinder seal from Khafaje49. The ringed post is also one of the pictographic signs on clay tablets found in Stratum IV at Uruk50; but strong arguments have been brought to bear against the equation of this sign with Nannar, the Moon-god of Ur51. The best illus- trations of the ringed post are afforded by seal impressions found in Strata C and A of the Anu Zikkurrat; one depicts two figures walking away from a pair of these symbols, others show the field of illustration empty except for a pair of ringed posts united at the base by a horizontal band as if to represent the threshold of a sanctuary 52. From its association with herds of cattle the ringed post was assuredly the symbol of a male deity; since in the Eanna precinct only one example of it was found, the seal impres- sion already mentioned representing cattle near a hut, and as numerous examples of it came to light at the Anu Zikkurrat where it was the only symbol represented, the conclusion is forced upon us that the ringed post was originally the symbol of Anu, the Sky-god, and not the star which is generally believed to denote him. Probably the star always had the connotation 'sky', 'heaven', and hence 'dweller in the sky', that is to say 'god' 53, and did not originally signify the god Anu himself who had his own symbol, the post with a ring.

Seal impres- sions from the archaic levels SIS 4 - 5 at Ur depict this symbol in pairs 55, mostly in scenes having to do with the care of cattle, but once in what was obviously a religious rite. At el-'Obeid, where the names of the two early kings, Mes-anni-padda and A-anni-padda, testify to the importance of the cult of Anu, the inlaid frieze from the temple façade pictures men milking cows and two calves coming from a hut with a pair of ringed posts at the entrance56. Worshippers bringing gifts for a sacrifice to be performed before the door of a shrine flanked by two ringed posts are shown on the lower register of a stone relief from Ur, as they are on an archaic cylinder seal illustrating a similar subject 57. It is noteworthy that in the Akkadian period in scenes representing the two nude 'Guardians of the Gate' fulfilling their functions, the gate-posts which they hold (in contradistinction to the wings of the door which they sometimes open) are always in the form of a post with a ring attached to one side near the top 58. Religious texts reveal the fact that these two guardians were Dumuzi and Ningizzida "who stood at the door of Anu's palace" 59. The so-called 'Figure aux plumes', an outline drawing rather than a relief in stone 60, depicts a bearded figure wearing a head-band with two feathers stuck into it and a skirt marked with criss-cross lines, who stands near two tall posts crowned with mace-heads, one of which he grasps. The right upper corner of the relief, with the upper parts of two further posts aligned with the first pair, is broken off. The work is transitional, for the general character of the subject and the garment of the figure are indicative of the time of Uruk III, although the technique and certain details, such as the hair and beard, intimate that it belongs to the time of Mesilim 61. In the inscription the name of the god Ningirsu is mentioned more than once and there is a reference to his temple E-Ninnû. It must therefore be the god himself who is portrayed holding one of the pair of great maces erected at the entrance to his sanctuary. It is possible that a few cylinder seals of true Jemdet Nasr style represent ceremonies in which the great maces of Ningirsu figured, for two of them were found at Lagaš 62. But the rendering is so sketchy that it is hard to determine the exact nature of the objects which the figures touch or carry. Thus the evidence of the representations taken all together seems to prove that the image of a bearded man clad in a peculiar transparent skirt of stuff with criss-cross lines represented a god, but not necessarily always the same god. It served as the portrait of any god who enacted the rôle of bridegroom in a ceremony of the sacred marriage. At Uruk it represented the consort of Innin, whose symbol was the ear of corn and who was the proto- 54) BM 123280, Sidney Smith, BMQ VII, 1933-34, p. 42, pl.

The tablet, how- ever, was not found in situ , but close to the foot of the south-east stair-ramp leading up to the terrace, and at a distance of more than 10 m. from the S. and E. corners of the temple which were, indeed, intact. The decoration of the temple seems more appropriate to a male divinity. See Woolley and Gadd, Ur Excav.

Douglas Van Buren type of the later Tammuz; at Lagaš it seems to have portrayed Ningirsu, whose bride was the goddess Bau. Anu, at the entrance to his temple as represented on the cylinder seal, wears a quite different garment, a sort of fringed shawl, for he did not manifest himself as a divine bridegroom but as a powerful deity to whom worship was offered. Preparations for a function were illustrated on a cylinder seal which is now too broken to permit the reconstruction of the whole ceremony (Fig. 12 )M. A nude man, kneeling on one knee, touches with two sticks certain objects lying on the ground. A second man leans over him to direct his operations, while a third, clad in a short skirt of criss-cross stuff, seems to move towards them. Traces of a fourth figure can be seen on the right, and in the back- ground there are vases of various shapes and sizes. The figures on an unusual cylinder seal, attributable to the time of Uruk IV, are divided into two groups by pairs of fantastic creatures with tiny bodies and immensely long necks twisted together to make a chain (Fig. 13) 64. Each group consists of two nude priests apparently preparing for a sacrifice. In the group on the left the two men stand facing each other; one grasps an animal with both hands, the other carries a paddle-shaped object; a big fish and a tall vase fill the space between them. In the other group a man kneels on one knee; he holds a short stick in one hand and an unidentified object in the other. The man opposite him holds up a fish, and a second fish and another object are disposed in the foreground. High up in the background of both scenes the severed heads of goats and other animals can be seen. Another cylinder seal, said to have been found with many others buried in a clay pot at Lagaš, illustrates numerous ritual objects placed near the door of a shrine. A nude priest advances towards the temple, holding up in both hands a vessel or symbol (Fig. 14) 65. Fragments of a seal impression from the archaic Stratum IV at Uruk depict various figures apparently nude; some stand, others kneel on one knee, but they all stretch out their arms as if to offer the bowls and vessels they hold to a man drawn on a bigger scale 66. It is not easy to decide whether he has a few loose locks of hair hanging down from the middle of his head to his shoulders, or whether he wears some kind of head-dress with a tassel like the man incised on a limestone fragment of a cup from Khafaje67. He holds or pulls with both hands the strands of something which has been thought to be reins on the assumption that he was in a chariot. But one fragment (W 9656 e) seems to show that he was seated, an unusual position for a charioteer at that period; and it is strange that there are no traces of the steeds beween him and the smaller figure kneeling in front (W 9656 d, g) ; the space would, indeed, be very exiguous. Taking into consideration the kneeling attitude of some of the figures and the actions of all of them it seems more likely that this seal impression represents another scene of preparation for a religious rite. In addition to works of art which represent religious rites there are a few which depict men who, by the actions they perform in a prescribed order, seem to be engaged in carrying out a ritual. Several fragments of a seal impression found in Stratum IV at Uruk represent at least ten nude priests advancing in procession, each one bearing a different cult object towards a reticulate construction believed to be an altar, just as on another seal impres- sion they walk towards the door of a temple holding long staffs or curved rods in front of them68. A steatite cylinder seal, believed to be from Sippar, reproduces a more elaborate procession69; two nude priests move to left, both of them carrying high poles surmounted by symbols to which a streamer is attached. One pole is capped by a horizontal bar supporting two small ringed posts, symbols of the god Anu; the second pole bore quite a different emblem, but it is too damaged to be explicable. These priests are preceded by a man 63) Oriental Inst. A 3616, Williams, The Collè of Western Asiatic Seals in the Haskell Or. Mus.: AJSL XLIV, 1927-28, p. 249 f fig. 67. 64) Ward, Cat.

Points of resemblance with this seal are shown by a much damaged seal impression from Uruk where a nude priest holds aloft a libation jug in front of a tall post surmounted by a horizontal bar supporting symbols of some kind; a streamer hangs down from the cross-bar (Fig. 15) 70. On the left are traces of what must have been a big ear of corn, if one may judge from the ribbon-like leaf and the close likeness of this stem to those depicted on cylinder seals of the period71. The scheme on another seal is somewhat obliterated, but once more the temple doorway forms the focal point, as if the human figures, in this case two nude priests, were subordinate (Fig. 16 )72. The first man holds a libation jug high above his shoulder with one hand, and in his lowered left hand he grasps an object. What looks like a big vase stands between him and the second man who supports a vase on his two raised hands. Worked in a very similar style a fragmentary serpentine seal has engraved upon it two nude priests, all that remain of a procession of figures73. One of them holds up a goblet with both hands; the end of a pole can be seen resting on the shoulder of the second man, as if he were one of a couple of bearers carrying some object suspended from a pole which they carried on their shoulders. Between the two figures preserved there is a libation jug. Only part of one figure is preserved on a still more mutilated seal impression found in Stratum IV at Uruk, but it may originally have depicted a similar scene74. The unbearded man is turned to right and wears a skirt, but it seems unliköly that a head-band should be indicated round his head. He is explained as carrying a spear and a bow, but it is possible that the implement he rests on his shoulder was of the same kind as that borne by the first man in the long procession of priests drawing near to an altar already mentioned. All these works of art seem to suggest that in the time of Uruk IV - III, and very much earlier if the clay female figurines of the painted pottery periods really represent a Mother-goddess75, deities were conceived in anthropomorphic form. They were provided with temples to serve as their earthly dwelling, with garments and ornaments to adorn their persons, with flocks and herds to provide for their material wants, and with offerings of many kinds to furnish food and drink in abundance. They were more human than the ideal conception of a male and female principle, but they were on a bigger scale than ordinary humanity, awe-inspiring, and only to be approached with the utmost reverence. Hence the necessity for an elaborate ritual, so that everything might be done according to a pre-ordained plan, that no detail should be forgotten, and that every action of every participant should be so regulated that nothing might mar the harmony of the performance, for that might incur danger of vitiating the efficacy of the rite. 70 ) W 2135; Photo W 747; Falkenstein, Archaische Texte , S. 59. 7i) von der Osten, Cat.
