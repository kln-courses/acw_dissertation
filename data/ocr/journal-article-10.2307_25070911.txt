The Shining of thy face enlivens mee. I live and dy as Smiles and Frowns take place: The Life, and Death of Joy Lodge in thy face. -Edward Taylor, Preparatory Meditations II, 97 The happiness of Heaven consisteth principaly in seeing Gods face. -John Norton, The Orthodox Evangelist (1654) Secondly; I will not slacken my seeking the Face of God. -Cotton Mather, Diary (1681) Puritan Iconophobia The longing to see God's face and to visualize the invisible world persisted as a phenomenon among New England Puritans despite the injunctions of the Second Commandment, which forbade the making of religious images and the worship of images, and despite a long tradition of iconoclasm in England. Calvin's Institutes ofthe Christian Religion, a basic Puritan text and one Edward Taylor owned,1 denounced the "bru tal stupidity" of desiring "visible representations of the Deity" and warned that God "rejects, without a single exception, all statues, pic tures, and other figures, in which idolators imagined that he would be near them." Even Moses, to whom God revealed his "back parts," was not permitted a full sight of God: " 'Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see my face and live.' " Calvin associated man's "stupid propensity" to make images of God with idols and idolatry: "For as soon as men have made a visible figure of God, they attach di vine power to it. Such is the stupidity of men, that they confine God to any image which they make to represent him, and therefore cannot but worship it. Nor is it of any importance whether they worship simply the idol, or God in the idol; it is always idolatry .. ."2 William Ames, whose The Marrow of Theology was equally influential in Puritan wor ship, concurred:</page><page sequence="2">16 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 Prayer is opposed by the use of representative images at or before which God is wor shiped, even though the worship is referred not to the images themselves-subjectively, as some say-but to God alone. Superstition of this type is called idolatry .... If idols are themselves worshiped in stead of God, this is the idolatry which violates the first commandment. If the true God is worshiped at an image or in an image, this is the idolatry which violates the second commandment.3 American Puritans upheld the strictness of Calvin's and Ames's in terpretations. John Cotton explained that the Second Commandment "Forbiddeth not onely bodily Images (graven or molten or painted) but all spirituall Images also; which are the imaginations and inventions of men. .. ." This interpretation was given expanded treatment in another work, published posthumously: So that all Portraitures, Shapes, Resemblances, and Forms of things, Natural, or Artifi cial, Real or Imaginary, devised by man for religious use, worship, or instruction, are for bidden by the scope and letter of the Commandment .... For it is not the matter of the thing, but the form or application that is against the Precept, which is one and the same in representations of what kind soever, in Pictures, proper, Metonymical, and Metaphorical: It matters not whether the Image be a thing truly existent, formed of any visible matter, Brass, Wood, or Stone; or whether it have no other being but in the mind of men. If it be an Image devised by men for Religious use, it commeth under the sen tence of the Law: . . ."4 In a sermon of 1689, Samuel Willard also inveighed against the repre sentation of God as a violation of the "Second Command": "HENCE how very unsutable is it to represent the Divine Nature by any Corporeal similitude: I mean in Pictures or Images, of any visible &amp; bodily sub stance, and that whether it be for civility or devotion . . . who ever was able rightly to decypher the form or shape of a being which is invisible! it is folly to pretend to afford us the Portraicture of an Angel, but it is a madness &amp; wickedness to offer at any Image or Representation of God. . . ." Nonetheless, since Puritans had a need to visualize, they sought ways to avoid the prohibitions and developed elaborate rationales for seeing God. Some imagemaking was sanctioned, after all. Although Willard had condemned both religious and civil images (he was later to change his mind), others forbade religious images but permitted those for "civill use."6 This distinction, made first by Calvin and reinvoked by English Puritan theologians William Perkins and William Prynne in the seventeenth century, was to furnish grounds for the many secularized images that adorned English and American tombstones. Even painting and sculpture, which Calvin called "gifts of God" had their place-if the objects represented were natural or "visible to our eyes." Most to be feared, he warned, was "human ingenuity."7 Hence Puritan painting was portraiture, without effort to improve on nature. Oliver Cromwell instructed John Lely to paint his portrait "truly like me, and not flatter</page><page sequence="3">The Face of God 17 me at all; but remark all these roughnesses, pimples, and warts, and everything as you see me. ..." John Hooper, a Puritan minister, was equally fearful of human ingenuity; he considered God the supreme art ist and scorned man-made art and artifice.8 Whether or not God could be imaged forth in pictures or carvings was an old debate.9 The particular emphases it acquired during the Ref ormation were dictated by political motives as well as the more obvious religious ones. Archbishop Laud, when defending himself in 1640 against charges of popery and idolatry, argued equivocally: "I do not think it lawful to make the picture of God the Father; but 'tis lawful to make the picture of Christ, and Christ is called the express images [sic] of His Father. I don't mean to say that the picture of Christ as God the Son may be made; for the Deity cannot be portrayed or pictured, though the humanity may."10 Perhaps to set themselves clearly apart from the hated Laud, perhaps to exploit a growing rift between Angli cans and themselves, Puritans concentrated their attack on these decid edly Catholic, visible emblems of evil. Immediately prior to the Civil War, the English Parliament issued ordinances to rid the land of such popish contaminants as images, altars, crucifixes, stained-glass windows, copes, surplices, fonts, screens, and organs. Among the leaders in the crusade against images were William Perkins, William Prynne, William Dowsing, and Richard Culmer. Dowsing's journal records a successful sacking expedition at Clare College Chapel: "We brake down 1000 Pic tures superstitious; I brake down 200; 3 of God the Father, and 3 of Christ, and the Holy Lamb, and 3 of the Holy Ghost like a Dove with Wings. .. ."" In 1642 Richard Culmer headed a commission to ex punge the "Cathedrall evill" at Canterbury, where the chapel was so cluttered with images he called it "a stable for idols." Everything went-tapestries, sculpture, paintings, stained-glass windows-even "proud Becket's glassy bones."12 When Puritans came to America they brought with them their hatred of images, as Anne Bradstreet's "Dialogue between Old England and New" makes clear. Written in 1642 during the outbreak of Eng land's "present troubles" (the Civil War), the poem sympathetically ex horts England "To root out Popelings": Let's bring Baals vestments forth to make a fire, Their Mytires, Surplices, and all their Tire, Copes, Rotchets, Crossiers, and such empty trash, And let their Names consume, but let the flash Light Christendome, and all the world to see We hate Romes whore, with all her trumpery.13 But the Puritans who piously hated Catholics and abjured their icons in troduced their own kinds of images in covert forms when they arrived on</page><page sequence="4">18 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 this side of the Atlantic-in poetry, sermons, histories, and tombstone carvings. They forbade icons in their churches but, as Allen Ludwig notes, New England churchyards flaunted winged skulls, angels, soul ef figies, and eros figures.14 The Puritans' need to visualize turned into a furtive aestheticism. Puritan poetry drew portraits and landscapes with striking pictorial effects; sermons conjured up lurid visions of hell and blueprints of the NewJerusalem; and histories recalled the lives of saints with bold theatricality. If sobriety and restraint marked the Puritans' outward demeanor, visions of devils and angels, witches and wondrous prodigies danced in the heads of the somberest divines. Not surprising ly, perhaps, behind Puritan iconophobia was a passionate longing to vis ualize the whole invisible world, to anatomize God and Christ as well as the abstractions of covenant theology, and to reconstruct Augustine's Invisible Church, post, beam, and pillar, in the collective imagination. Puritans even called themselves "visible saints."15 The Corporeal God Although "bodily Images" were forbidden, Edward Taylor refers to God's "shoulders," "lips," "face," "bowels," "ears," "hand," "Eye," "breast" in his thirty-five-poem epic of salvation, "Gods De terminations." But with the characteristic ambivalence of many Puritan writers and poets, Taylor stops just short of assembling the parts into a picture, and, in fact, denies that they are really parts at all: And that he hath no parts though Head, and Heart. Hands, Ears, and Eyes he hath, he hath no part.16 Jonathan Edwards, too, imaginatively reconstitutes the missing parts when he writes, "The Soul when separated from the Body, has not (nor have Angels) bodily Eyes or Ears; nevertheless it has that which is Analo gous thereunto, so that it can see and hear." 17 Images of Christ's bodily parts recur with striking frequency in Puritan poetry, in sermons, and on tombstones. Because He seemed more immanent in direct pictorial rep resentations, tombstones commonly displayed breasts and gourds to symbolize His divine nourishment for the soul. In his study of New Eng land tombstone art, Allan Ludwig matches breast images carved onto stone with literary analogues in the works ofJonathan Edwards, Edward Taylor, and Thomas Hooker to stress the specifically anthropomorphic terms in which the Puritan mind conceived God. The Taylor example is strikingly graphic: Lord put these nibbles then my mouth into And suckle me therewith I humbly pray, Then with this milk thy Spirituall Babe I'st grow, And these two milke pails shall themselves display Like to these pritty twins in pairs round neate And shall sing forth thy praise over this meate. (p. 354)</page><page sequence="5">The Face of God 19 In this sermon Taylor again fixes his attention on Christ's body: "If the bodies of the Saints shall at the Resurrection Shine like the body of the Sun, what shall the body of Christ the Son of God Shine like.... Surely if he appeared in a vision to Daniel having his body like unto byrill, his arms &amp; feet in Colour like unto polisht brass, his eyes like Lumps of fire, his face like a slash of Lightening, &amp; his voice like a clap of thunder, as Dan. 10.6 &amp; 9, oh then what glory shall he now appeare in?"18 While it was legitimate to quote scripture, the frequency of corporeal images of Christ and God in Puritan literature calls for a fuller explanation. Taylor, in fact, almost obsessively returns to God's "brightsom" or "bright Sun-Shine" face. Two entire sequences of the "Meditations" explore and linger about the face of God-his head, eyes, cheeks, lips, mouth, palate, windpipe; his teeth, hair, temples, neck. Taylor's text, from Canticles both expresses a private wish to "lodge my Eyes upon thy Cheekes," to "give my Souls Cleare Eye of thee a Sight" and conceals the wish beneath a more acceptable need for scriptural exegesis. When Taylor rhapsodizes, "Oh! let him kiss mee with his orall kisses," he has a literal as well as a metaphorical referent.19 It should be noted, how ever, thatJohn Cotton explains this text in a strictly metaphorical sense: "Kisses are pledges and incentives of love" and "God kissing a mans lips, is the cause of mans answering upright words." Cotton similarly reads "His mouth is most sweet," by denying any reference to the body. The entire gloss is "The doctrine of the Gospell was taught more and more favourly by Johannes Rochesana, and other Ministers in Bohe mia."20 Yet Cotton's denial of the literal elements and Taylor's obses sive return to God's bodily parts ("Eyes," "Cheeke," "lips," or "mouth" appear seventeen times in Meditation II. 121) argue for a hid den wish to visualize God. Nor was it unusual for Puritans to write, as Taylor did, of the "transporting contentment" it would yield "to Se God face to face, to se Jesus Christ, to Se the wayes of God in the World!"21 Anne Brad street implores Christ to "Hide not thy face from me. ..."22 Increase Mather urged his congregation to meditate until they achieved a "Facial Vision" of God.23 Cotton Mather gave similar instructions to his read ers. In The AccomplishedSinger (Boston, 1721) he commanded them to sing with such love and understanding that they might gain the sight of God's face and achieve a spiritual conversation with Him: "We should first Hear what the Glorious GOD speaks unto us, ... and perform what the Psalmist so exemplified: Seek ye my Face; On hearing this My Heart did speak to thee; Thy Face, O then Eternal GOD, Thy Face now willI will [sic] seek. "24 Michael Wigglesworth similarly exhorts his read ers to "seek the face of God with all thy heart. "25 The need to see God's</page><page sequence="6">20 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 face and to anatomize His parts, however, was only one aspect of Puritan visualizing. Covert Aestheticism: Poetry, Painting, and Drama In his preface to a long poem explicating the Song of Songs, Thomas Beverly admits that poetry is "Censur'd and Condemn'd," but justifies his verse by arguing that prose could not approach the "High Spirit, and Lofty Air" of the "Divinely Inspired Poesie" that the Holy Spirit dictated to Solomon: "I am also in Hope, that the Diversion and Acceptableness of Words in number and measure, may Invite to the Consideration of the Matter so convey'd, and that while the Poetry is Censur'd and Condemn'd, yet the sense may slide in, and lay hold of the Judgment. 26 Similar justifications for using images in poetry are examined by Robert Daly in his recent book, God's Altar.27 Daly argues that the Puritans did not regard themselves as makers of verbal artifacts, for to be such would violate the law of Exodus 20; instead they con sidered themselves readers of God's symbols, viewers of the patterns, or "types," that spelled out His message in the things of this world. If man could not make types because he feared creating verbal idols, he could at least see them, as Samuel Mather argued: "It is not safe to make any thing a Type merely upon our own fancies and imaginations; it is Gods Prerogative to make Types".28 Another theological rationale for making images was the belief that sensual images were a means of raising the affections of the creatures to ward God. Like Robert Beverly, English Puritan Richard Baxter acknowl edged that although images were ordinarily "improper," they became proper when the Holy Ghost used them: ... he [the Holy Ghost] describeth the glory of the NewJerusalem, in expressions that might take even with flesh itself: As that the Streets and Buildings are pure Gold, that the gates are Pearl .... These with most other descriptions of our Glory are expressed, as if it were the very flesh and Sense; which though they are all improper and figurative, yet doubtless if such expressions had not been best, and to us necessary, the Holy Ghost would not have so frequently used them.29 My interpretation of these passages, however, is based upon a different assumption; they both seem to be rationalizations for making images. They offer excuses that sanctify what scripture prohibits. By this reason ing a poet could write a poem of comment upon "types," then disavow his creativity. Another poet could rhapsodize about the glories of the New Jerusalem, and claim the inspiration-and information-came from the Holy Ghost. Both of the above justifications for imagemaking are questioned at length by Michael Clark.30 Citing passages by William Ames, Thomas Hooker, and John Cotton, Clark emphasizes the disconnection between</page><page sequence="7">The Face of God 21 the physical image or sign and its meaning in Puritan semiology. The Puritans, he wrote, "never could accept the material world as a basis for their epistemology" because to do so would violate Calvin's tenet that the inscription of God's word upon a man's soul was superior to any knowledge he gained from his senses.31 John Cotton, among others, denigrated the role of the senses in perceiving spiritual truths: "Set be fore a man any pleasant prospect, and if his mind be on another thing, all his senses take no notice of it; if the heart be not taken up with a thing, the eye minds it not; present the eare with any sweet melodious sound, and it heares and minds it not, because the heart was otherwise taken up; but upon whatsoever the heart is set, to that the eye lookes, and the eare attends.. ."32 Clark contends that Baxter's position was theologically un-Puritan and radical in its time, since the use of sensual images to raise the affec tions belonged to the Catholic and Anglican traditions: "For the Puri tans, however, Cotton declares that such images are strictly forbidden under the interdiction of the second commandment. They are danger ous, he says, and distract the heart rather than direct it unless one is already 'enlightened with the knowledge of God and the mystery of Sal vation.' "33 Excerpts from Edward Reynolds, Samuel Willard, John Preston, William Perkins, and John Smith are used to demonstrate the 'Puritans' mistrust of corporeal images. In fact, William Chappell's in terpretation of Genesis 15:1 asserted that a sign had to be, in Clark's words, "literally decomposed-taken apart by erasing its existence as a sensible image-in order to perceive the direction in which it points us. 34 Certainly, as these arguments by Daly and Clark demonstrate, Pu ritans exhibited an ambivalence toward images. They both needed them and needed to deny them. They apologized for their poetry and ex plained that their images were sanctioned or dictated by the Holy Ghost, and considered their poets merely translators of God's types spelled out in earthly things. Then they wrote the poetry. Sensual im ages, some argued, were necessary to raise man's affections toward God; others maintained the opposite conviction, that sensual images were de ceptive lures which turned man from God. Norman Grabo suggests that the meditative tradition met both needs in offering a verbal substitute for visualizing. The verbal emphasis on the sensual apprehension of images that marks the devotional writ ings of Robert Dingley, William Fenner, and Edward Reynolds is evi dence of a displaced need to see. In this passage from Dingley's Spiritual Taste described, the need to visualize is apparent: "Conceive you saw those things with your bodily eyes, which we set out by Metaphors: As when we tell you sin is a plague-soare, imagine you were shut up, and</page><page sequence="8">22 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 had running soares upon you, and saw the passengers baulk you, and stop their noses, &amp;c. How would you then skream, and cry out with Paul, 0 who shall deliver me from this body of death? . . ."35 The poems and sermons of Edward Taylor offer a rich source of this type of ambivalence, which is present in Puritan writing generally. Characteristically, the aesthetic impulse asserts itself, then is concealed by a variety of disclaimers. Just as Beverly and Baxter acknowledged that poetry was censured, but then went on to write it, Taylor denies his own art. In the picture of the creation that begins "Gods Determinations," Taylor carefully avoids any reference to prettiness or beauty; even God is a skilled nonartist: Who Lac'de and Fillitted the earth so fine, With Rivers like green Ribbons Smaragdine? Who made the Sea's its Selvedge, and it locks Like a Quilt Ball within a Silver Box? (p. 387) He is craftsman, artisan, needleworker, architect, forger-everything but sculptor, painter, poet, their aesthetic counterparts. And Taylor at different times is a nonpoet who "lisps," whose pen "jags and jars," who sings in "broken notes," whose "Tongue is neither Quill nor Bow," whose poems announce (perhaps too loudly) their inarticulate ness.36 In a sermon Taylor renounces the embellishments of art as the "plain style" required, but he does it eloquently: "But Grace excells all Metaphors. The varnish laid upon it doth but darken, and not decorate it: its own colours are too glorious to be made more glorious, by any Col our of Secular Glory."37 Here especially, Taylor's renunciation embod ies what it forswears: a metaphor argues against metaphors; an image of almost-paint and color insists that grace cannot be and must not be painted. Yet Taylor continued to "paint" his religion. Like the saint in "Gods Determinations," he would "paint/out Satans sculking," make him visible as a "fierce Shagg'd Red Lion belching fire," a yelping hound; he would "anatomize" in pattern and color. Sin is "Crimson spots" on Christ's "Milkwhite Robes"; hell is painted with "black-blew /Brimstony flames"; Christ's coach has a "scarlet Canopy/ O'er silver Pillars ... / All bottomed with purest gold refin'de." In another paint ing image, Mercy promises to gild the Dove (i.e., the soul of the poor doubting Christian): Thy wings with Silver Colours I'le o're lay: And lay thy feathers o're with yellow gold. (p. 398) Anne Bradstreet shared Taylor's ambivalence about art. She comes dan gerously close to acknowledging an aesthetic impulse in this rare in stance of sensual response in "Contemplations":</page><page sequence="9">The Face of God 23 Their leaves &amp; fruits seem'd painted, but was true Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, Rapt were my senses at this delectable view. (p. 370) But she takes it all back again in "The Vanity of all worldly things": The sensual senses for a time they please, Mean while the conscience rage, who shall appease? What is't in beauty? No that's but a snare, They're foul enough to day, that once were fair. (p. 386) The bold visual effects of "Contemplations" frequently appeared in sermons and elegies. Examples range from Cotton Mather's portrait of old age in his elegy for Ezekiel Cheever to the panoramic "painting" of an Indian attack in Benjamin Tompson's "New-Englands Crisis": If painter overtrack my pen let him An olive colour mix, these elves to trim; Limm them besmear'd with Christian Bloud &amp; oild With fat out of white humane bodyes boil'd. Draw them with clubs like maules &amp; full of stains, Like Vulcans anvilling New-Englands brains. .. .38 Mather chose portraiture again for his controlling metaphor in a ser mon, The Pourtraiture of a Good Man, Drawn with the Pencils of the Sanctuary, in such Colours as the Oracles of the Sacred Scriptures have given him. Alluding to Psalms 26:9, Mather works his own curious ex ample for viewing a spiritual model: "There was a Prince of Bohemia who had a very admirable Father, and therefore he always carried the Picture of his Father, which he would often take out, and look on, and say, Let me never do anything unworthy the son of such a Father. I am sure we have an amiable Saviour; and we have the Picture of our Saviour in His Gospel; Now a Good Man will often view it. ... ."39 Behind the metaphor is the same need to see the image of God that we noted in others. Drama of course would have provided a more obvious outlet for this need to visualize than verbal painting and portraiture did, but the prohibitions against it were resolutely intoned by English Puritans for more than a hundred years. Among the many antitheatre tracts were John Northbrooke's A Treatise against Dicing, Dancing, Plays, and In terludes, with other idle pastimes (1577); Stephen Gosson's School of Abuse . . ." (1579) and his Plays confuted in Five Actions; Philip Stubbes's Anatomie of Abuses in England (1583); William Rankins' Mirror of Monsters (1587); Dr. Rainolds' Overthrow of Stage-Players (1599); and William Prynne's encyclopedic Histriomastix (1633).40 Jo seph Crouch attributes much of the controversy to the class struggle be tween the courtly gallants, who had a taste for bawdry and theatrical ex</page><page sequence="10">24 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 travaganzas, and the common citizens, who had plainer preferences. But the situation did not change much in the next hundred years, asJer emy Collier's Short view of the Immorality and Profaneness of the Eng lish State (1698) suggests. Cecelia Tichi argues that an important motive for the Puritans' antipathy to drama was their firm belief in the treach ery of the imagination.41 Many Puritan writers-among them Thomas Hooker, Thomas Cobbett, andJoseph Seccomb-used vivid metaphors to link actors with the ultimate sinner, or "carnall Hipocrite." Yet such linking seems an imaginative act, clearly originating in human minds. To change the emphasis of Tichi's case slightly, the banished impulse, returns in a more acceptable form. Daniel Dyke's comment is a good ex ample of invoking the forbidden image while denouncing it: "But if, in this life, God thus not detect thine asses eares under thy Lyons skin, as suredly he will doe it throughly in the life to come at the last day, when he shall strip thee starke naked of all thy cloakes ofcraftiness, wherewith thou veiledst thy shame here."42 The metaphor of the world as stage and humanity as corrupt players may have come from church or secular traditions or from Dyke's own imagination. The significant feature is not the source of the metaphor but that it won out over many other ways of characterizing man's relation to God. The implication is that, despite public and institutional censorship, the need to give imaginative expres sion to one's feelings remained and dictated a peculiar ambivalent pat tern in Puritan cultural life. Against such a background, drama in America necessarily reap peared in various disguises, particularly among ministers, who likely sensed the restrictions most acutely. Edward Taylor's poetic sequence suggests a series of four acts even in its full title: (1) Gods Determina tions touching his Elect: (2) The Elects Combat in their Conversion, and (3) Coming up to God in Christ together with (4) the Comfortable Ef fects thereof: Moreover, it has many of the essential features of a play with its colorful images and emblems, the songlike paeans to Christ, the "agons" between the soul and Satan.43 Although the sources of this strange, iconographic poem are varied and much debated by critics,44 the dramatic form suggests that even an orthodox minister had the need to visualize and concretize his religion. A further but well-known ele ment of covertness is the fact that Taylor did not wish to publish his poetry and hid several hundred manuscript pages in the bindings of his library books.45 Thomas M. Davis has only recently discovered addition al poems among the Taylor holdings at Yale, and is painstakingly trans cribing them for publication.46 The Puritans' need for some form of drama took the same ambiva lent forms of expression that informed the poems cited earlier. Thomas Hooker, while denouncing the "Stage-player," as a "vaineglorious</page><page sequence="11">The Face of God 25 wretch," and the model of hypocrisy, uses his own theatrical metaphor: " . . .God pluckes [him] off the stage of the world."47 And Cotton Mather's extravagant diatribe against plays belies his fascination with the theatre. Referring to Bedford's The Evil and Danger of Stage Plays (1706), he warns his son to beware of "those vile rhapsodies": They [plays] are national sins, and therefore call for national plagues .... How much do I wish that such pestilences, and indeed all those worse than Egyptian toads, (the spawns of a Butler, a Brown, and a Ward, and a company whose name is legion!) might never crawl into your chamber! The unclean spirits that come like frogs out of the mouth of the dragon, and of the beast. ... As for those wretched scribbles of madmen, my son, touch them not, taste them not, handle them not: thou wilt perish in the using of them.48 Denunciation notwithstanding, Mather exclaims, "Indeed, what is the Earth, but a Theatre, as has long been observed?"49 Indeed, he presents himself in the opening pages of his Magnalia Christi Americana as a Pu ritan Cecil B. DeMille, boldly commanding his audience- 'Reader! " to attend in subsequent chapters such spectacular "Actors" as Sir Wil liam Phips, John Winthrop, Edward Hopkins, and Theophilus Eaton. Versions of Randolph Scott and John Wayne, they undergo such awe some trials of courage, honor, and physical stamina as piracy, famine, and Indian wars can afford. Mather even casts himself in a small role as "Impartial Historian": "Reader, prepare to be entertained with as pro digious Matters as can be put into any History! "? What follows is a bi zarre but straightfaced account of devils, Energumens, sorcery, witch craft and magic, deamons, and spectres. Norman Grabo has noted a va riety of ways in which the Puritans' need for drama shaped their litera ture: ... the Puritans found means to satisfy the universal craving for well-wrought mimesis. Having outlawed the satisfactions of High-church ritual (a form of both dance and drama), and fearful of the magnetic attraction of icons for idolatry, they turned to litera ture .... the satisfaction we derive from modern literature they undoubtedly found in exempla, illustrious providences, tall tales and anecdotes; they explored human charac ter through the popular Theophrastan "characters" incorporated in funeral elegies, his tories, personal "relations" of the workings of saving grace. .. ; they impelled their characters through high adventure in an Indian infested wilderness .... with no less a sense of plot than informs most television westerns; and they learned to shape dialogue into a variety of dramatic forms. . . 5 The jeremiads, or political sermons, afforded another form of the atricality, a phenomenon suggesting that ministers worked over their audiences with a sense of drama befitting Greek tragedy. Their tragic hero was typically portrayed as an afflicted saint, according to Sacvan Bercovitch.52 He appeared variously as a prodigal son, a patient, a bibli cal hero, or Job:</page><page sequence="12">26 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 The jeremiads support this argument with a variety of scriptural analogues. They present the settlers as a prodigal son whose father was hedging his ways with thorns to confine his sinful inclinations. Or they paint them as a patient receiving treatment from "the great Physician of Israel." Or again, they picture them as a biblical hero in his moment of temptation: Moses at the rock, David in adultery, Peter denying Christ, and, repeatedly, "Job in the midst of his plunges," begging for pity, . . .53 Moreover, the theatrical nature of the jeremiads often had as its objec tive the need to make Christ visible. As events tolled the coming apocalypse, the jeremiads boiled with visions of Christ's descent. So rigid and literal was the general notion of the Second Coming-a notion that grew increasingly fixed as despair mounted-that actual dates were set for Christ's arrival. Bercovitch notes that Thomas Parker set it for 1650, John Cotton for 1655, William Aspinwall for 1673, Increase Mather for 1715, and Cotton Mather for 1711-at the latest, "M.DCC.XVI."54 In these instances, and on a broad cultural level, Pu ritans behaved like abandoned children, hysterically demanding the ap pearance of their missing parent. This childlike longing to see their god, I hope to show, was to be manifested in a number of ways. Like the icons and pictorial representations of God-which made a transcendent being immanent-the jeremiads attempted to fix in time, if not in space, the event they feared was not coming, the god beyond reach. The magnitude and intensity of the late jeremiads (i.e., those of the 1690's) functioned, as an art form might, to isolate and preserve a valued idea, to create a hold on chaos. In this context, Bercovitch cites Mather's Magnalia as an attempt to build a "monument," to make a vi sion manifest.55 As Mather himself declares: "But whether New-Eng land may Live any where else or no, it must Live in our History!" The connection, in fact, between statuary and Mather's Magnalia was one Mather clearly intended: "There is no way," he wrote, "for us to fetch back our Sir William Phips, and make him yet Living with us, but by setting up a Statue for him, as 'tis done in these Pages, that may out-last an ordinary Monument."56 Stone Icons: God Frowns with a Smiling Face Literal monuments, or tombstone carvings, offer the most explicit examples of Puritan iconography. Although they wantonly smashed im ages in England, Puritans began to carve hundreds of souls and angels onto stone almost as soon as they arrived in America. Ministers, in fact, often had the most elaborately carved tombstones. Allan Ludwig regards this shift from iconophobia in England to iconography in America as "one of the most neglected transformations in our cultural history.'"57 But this transformation is somewhat less surprising in light of another transformation which took place in England.</page><page sequence="13">The Face of God 27 Queen Elizabeth, perhaps feeling that the depredations against re ligious images under her predecessors Henry VIII and Edward VI had gone too far, issued a proclamation in 1560 against the destruction of tombs. The rationale was that civil memorials to honor the dead were free from popish associations and should be allowed to stand. "Abused," or religious images, on the other hand-relics, stained glass, statues, maypoles, "monuments of feigned miracles, pilgrimages, idolatry," "tables, pictures, paintings"-were condemned and to be destroyed.58 The effect of the proclamation was to alter drastically the character of gravestone images. Instead of displaying religious symbols, the tombs erected in the latter part of the sixteenth century were richly figured with portraits of the deceased, heraldic shields, lengthy inscrip tions; in place of God, the Virgin, and the saints were abstractions of virtues possessed by the deceased: faith, charity, wisdom.59 Later repre sentations became more concrete until, in the seventeenth century, tombs displayed weeping cherubs with doused torches, skulls and cross bones, cinerary urns, scythes, and hourglasses. Most New England tombstone carvings were not significantly dif ferent from the English carvings. Their designs announced that they were civil memorials and were in no danger of being idolatrous. They typically displayed the same emblems of death-skulls and crossbones, portraits of the deceased, skeletons, coffins, tombs, picks and shovels, scythes, hourglasses, cherubs, and angels.60 Thus the transformation Ludwig identifies seems more precisely a transplantation of carving prac tices that grew in England during the Reformation. Similarly, the Eng lish controversy over whether images were "abused" or "unabused" underwent translation in America,61 where "unabused" was called "civil." Under similar strictures, civil images flourished in America. John Cotton and Samuel Willard, we have seen, took an orthodox stand; for Willard, images were forbidden "whether it be for civility or devotion." If, as Willard preached, "it is folly to pretend to afford us the Portraic ture of an Angel," Puritans could not easily explain the hundreds of an gels carved on their tombstones-unless they were "civil." Or so argued Samuel Mather in A Testimony from the Scripture against Idolatry &amp; Superstition (1672). He took pains to interpret the Second Command ment as "not meant of Images for Civil use, but for worship .... For the Civil use of Images is lawful for the representation &amp; remembrance of a person absent, for honour and Civil worship to any worthy person, as also for ornament, but the scope of the Command is against Images in State and use religious."62 By 1701 Willard concurred. While the evi dence is too scant to permit a conclusion, the conflicting statements sug gest a familiar ambivalence. If in England "unabused" meant a monu</page><page sequence="14">28 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 ment would remain unsmashed, in America the practice held. Civil im ages were not profane; well, let them be civil. Whatever the censorship, the Puritans' need to see won out. But in addition to the secular or "civil" carvings, which were large ly borrowed from the European emblem tradition, was a carving style that was religious in character and little discussed. Essex County tomb stones, particularly those in Ipswich and Haverhill, Massachusetts, offer the most striking examples of the Puritans' need to visualize, not only angels and souls approaching heaven, but the deceased's longing to see the Beatific Vision. In a paper delivered in 1976, David Watters called attention to this millennial style, characterized by exaggerated eyes, rep resenting the soul in a state of bliss.63 Watters juxtaposed representative samples of this carving technique with sermon texts by Increase Mather and Jonathan Edwards, and poems by Edward Taylor. The texts make clear the Puritan belief that after death the saint's body would become as Christ's body, and just prior to the moment of glory, the deceased would acquire "Bodily Eyes" with which to behold Christ.64 The carv ings on the Essex County stones are of several types, but they character istically display gaping, double-outlined eyes which, presumably, are straining toward heaven and the vision of Christ. The special emphasis given the eyes on these stones suggests to me not only the acquisition of bodily eyes, but the strength of the Puritans' need to see God.65 Perhaps because they could not depict Him, they depicted their own longing to do so. Unlike the winged death's heads, the soul effigies of Essex Coun ty never appeared in England, nor, according to Ludwig, did they ap pear in other coastal towns. According to Peter Benes, even the carvings of Plymouth County, which resemble, in a rough vernacular way, the traditional winged death's' heads of Salem and Boston stones, have a religious source. In a recently published study, The Masks of Orthodoxy, Benes attributes the preference for primitive motifs in Plymouth County to a religious im pulse that became subverted as folk art.66 By avoiding traditional sym bols of Christianity and the essentially English baroque style, carvers could still project their expectations of heavenly joy. Most important, Benes stresses the "conscious and intimate connection between grave stone artwork and religious expectations." 67 As strictures relaxed in New England, a subtle evolution in local carving styles took place. The Massa chusetts Bay skull imagery was supplanted by caricatures and vernacular resurrection motifs, which gradually included "things that are in heaven above" and angels themselves. In fact, Benes suggests that, coincident with a declining orthodoxy, the expressions on the stones changed from sinister to pious to jubilant.68 They became animated during the Great Awakening and frenzied prior to the Revolution, reflecting, much as a</page><page sequence="15">The Face of God 29 Greek chorus might, the alternately disastrous or happy expectations of the culture. The most common type of tombstone art-what Ludwig calls "pro vincial baroque"- is not ostensibly religious. It is characterized by its ambivalent designs. Traditional images of death-skulls, coffins, hour glasses and the like-are frequently interwoven with emblems of resur rection-wings, the hooped snake of infinity, vines and flowers, angels, anthropomorphic suns. Despite the many variations, most stones juxta posed emblems of opposites to suggest simultaneous pain and exalta tion, grief and joy, corporeal death and spiritual marriage. Such fusions took the form of winged skulls, flowers breaking forth from cinerary urns, soul effigies emerging from death's heads. Still others joined a tri umphant skeleton, garlanded, with the hooped snake or with the shell (a symbol of birth). Trumpeting angels on later New England stones im plied the same duality in their call for the dead to arise.69 Ambivalence, in fact, is a characteristic of Puritan art and of Puri tan political rhetoric. The jeremiads offered the same fusion of images of death and resurrection, most notably in the image from which they de rive their name. Jeremiah was two-faced: as a "Sonne of Thunder" he condemned man's apostasy; as a "Sonne of consolation" he held forth the promise of salvation.70 Similarly these qualities define the double nature of the ideal Puritan minister, "forceful and loving, 'Son of thun der, son of the dove.' " David Hall observes that, as "faithful shepherd," it was the minister's role to be gentle and patient: "Like a 'nurse' protecting her 'children' (1 Thess. 2:7), the Reformed minister adapted a meekness of style suited to his role as pastor." But when occa sion required, the minister became "soldier" (2 Tim. 2:3), and he in toned the consequences of sin with driving authority.71 Bercovitch traces the "dual legacy" of New England Congregationalism to theological opposites: Calvin's Christological-absolute-individual eschatology and Luther's temporal-progressive-collective orientation. By 1650, he notes, they had become inseparable.72 Edward Taylor rendered the same dualism dramatically in "Gods Determinations" in the debate between Justice and Mercy. Twin aspects of God, they seem a "type" ofJeremiah and of the gentle/severe ideal minister. In the same poem Taylor fuses the oppositions of preparation ist and antipreparationist theology. He presents them as a central para dox, a struggle toward grace, which man cannot earn because grace is freely bestowed: Do all Good Works, work all good things you know As if you should be sav'd for doing so. Then undo all you've done, and it deny And on a naked Christ alone rely. (p. 444)</page><page sequence="16">30 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 These lines, as Kenneth Silverman observes, prescribe the impossible as a simple rule for getting to heaven.73 Yet the fusion of opposites was deeply rooted in Puritan experience and a distinctive feature of Puritan works. Taylor gave it an image: God "frowns with a smiling face." The Invisible World Afterlife was dramatized at least as often as life. Graphic depictions of heaven and hell, of angels and demons, were crammed into sermons, such poems as Wigglesworth's Day ofDoom, and books like John Nor ton's The Orthodox Evangelist, Increase Mather's Angelographia, and Cotton Mather's Wonders of the Invisible World. In a sermon, Edward Taylor describes Christ's throne with photographic detail: "a Saphire having round about it the appearance of Amber." It "is high &amp; lifted up with Shining Angels attending on it," "White," and "probably [Taylor's only qualifier] is set up[on] a Saphirine Pavement, or the Crystalline Fermament. ..." He describes hell as vividly, if with greater animation: ... a whole Hell full of such ugly things, of roagues, Spirits, Ghosts, &amp; Divels! ... roar ing, yelling, frying, Crying, tering, rending, froathing, foaming under the wrath of the almighty, trembling.... Oh! those Screeches, those Cryes, those yellings, those roaring, those gusted-out Screeches, that Gnashing of Teeth .... Oh those ashes in the joynts, pains in the bones, those Cramps, &amp; convulsions of the joynts &amp; sinews. Oh those burn ings, boylings &amp; perboylings of the flesh, all rowled in fla[m]ing Coals &amp; bathed in burning flames!74 Anne Bradstreet's poem reconstructs the invisible "City, where I hope to dwell" (using earthly riches to renounce earthly riches): Mine Eye doth pierce the heavens, and see What is Invisible to thee. My garments are not silk nor gold My Crown not Diamonds, Pearls, and gold. ... (p. 384) John Norton uses the same text to evoke the image of what the New Jerusalem is not, cataloguing the gems and their colors that comprise the twelve foundations of the heavenly city: "Jasper," "Saphir," "Calcedomy," "Emrald," "Sardonxy," "Sardius," "Chrysolite," "Beryl," "Topaz," "Chrysophragus," "Jacint," and "Amathist."75 Apparently ignoring the prohibition of Exodus 20:4 and 5, "Thou shalt make thee no graven image, neither any similitude of things that are in heaven above . . ," Norton proceeds to map three realms of heaven; to chart the dimensions of the NewJerusalem as 12,000 furlongs, or "five teen English miles square"; and to name as its inhabitants God, Christ, and "innumerable company of Angels."</page><page sequence="17">The Face of God 31 Wherever scripture afforded a "look," as it were, Puritan writers and ministers developed theological skoptophilia. Denial created urgen cy; uncertainty spawned its opposite. The more anxious that Puritans became about the state of their souls, the more literal their representa tions of the heavenly realm became. It was in the shape of a "cubit" 12,000 furlongs in height, width, and depth; it had three gates pointing in each of four directions; the gates were encrusted with specific (but nonearthly) gems, whose colors were precisely described. The more un certain ministers were about being saved, Bercovitch has demonstrated, the more certainly their jeremiads predicted the coming apocalypse. The more transcendent God was supposed to be in the imagination, Allen Ludwig argues, the more immanent became His breasts and bodily parts on tombstones, where they were least likely to be thought idolatrous. Wherever visualization was severely curtailed, hallucinatory experi ences and collective fantasies were bound to develop. Cotton Mather, for one, was well in touch with denizens of the "Invisible World," and records wrestling with an angel on the floor of his study and taking "particular advice" from him concerning his wife Abigail's health.76 Nor was the belief in witches and demons his bright, particular delu sion; it was shared by a culture that caused the hanging of nineteen witches.77 As a prelude to his attack on Quakers, Daniel Leeds records having had a "Vision of Christ coming down from Heaven which was Wonderful" at the age of twelve; he experienced another when he was twenty.78 In Angelographia, his treatise on angels, Increase Mather af firms that angels are invisible but "Real Beings" who "can come into Houses, when the doors are shut ...." God, according to Mather, has "thousands of angels attending him" and they fly "swiftly," and "in a moments time they go from one end of the World to the other." They can destroy, when necessary by means of thunder and lightning, or warn of dangers to come or "Great Changes. "79 But A Disquisition Concern ing Angelical APPARITIONS, . .. shewing that Daemons oft appear like Angels of Light ... (Boston, 1696) warns that angels are sometimes impersonated by demons. People were too, for that matter; it was hard to tell which from witch. Fear of retribution for secret sins and hidden evil seems to have literalized the imagination. Anxiety demanded vigilance and exactitude, and caused Puritans to keep score on an invisi ble ball game; their lives here and hereafter would be drastically affected by whether the angels or demons were winning. Related to the need to make visions manifest was the inclination to see in natural events evidence of supernatural patterns. Not a sparrow fell but God ordained it, and Puritan historiography is rich with ac counts of remarkable providences that tokened God's smile: fortuitous drownings of evil persons, the death of hostile Indians by smallpox, safe</page><page sequence="18">32 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 arrivals from abroad. More numerous, however, were signs of His frown -drownings of innocents, the death of settlers by smallpox, Indian raids.80 Both Kometographia (1683) and Remarkable Providences (1684) by Increase Mather are attempts to read the designs of Providence. In the former work Mather attempts to correlate blazing stars and other heavenly lights with war between the English and the Dutch, a plague, fire, drought, and floods. He concludes the discourse with an appropri ate doom-poem translated by "Silvester" from Dubartas: There, with long Bloody Hair, a Blazing Star Threatens the World with Famin, Plague &amp; war: To Princes death; to Kingdomes many crosses: To all Estates, inevitable losses: To Herdsmen Rot; to Plow men hapless Seasons: To Saylors, Storms: to Cities civil Treasons.81 In Remarkable Providences Mather presents "evidence" of the invisible world by visible happenings: deliverances from danger at sea, prayers answered, remarkable effects of lightning, floods, hurricanes, and whirl winds; relations of possessed persons and apparitions-in short, signs of God's smile or frown. But the line that separated smile from frown was often hard to discern, and it was equally hard to tell a "judgment" from the "corrective affliction" God meted out to those He loved best. As Puritans watched for the signs, the pitch of anxiety rose. With the same worried scrutiny, they looked within themselves for signs of saving grace -i.e., mystical experiences-which all church members claimed to have found.82 The common denominator in these poems, sermons, and trea tises is an unshakeable belief in the power and reality of the invisible world. Perhaps to control their fears and their uncertain relation to it, they felt compelled to create rules for it, to give a specific geography to it, and to people it with unworldly creatures. Anxiety and Puritan Art Forms: A Psychocultural View In the absence of institutional and cultural sanctions of painting, belles-lettres, and drama, the Puritan propensity to have mystical expe riences, produce witches, "spectral evidence," hellfire phantas magorias, angels, and devils, and to see God's frown or smile in every natural event, does not seem strange. The need to see God's face may have been from the first a sign of cultural anxiety. Cut off from history and social tradition by their wilderness trial, the Puritans were, in a sense, cultural orphans. Anxieties of separation, exacerbated by the very real dangers of the wilderness, likely proliferated on a cosmic scale. That they saw themselves adrift is clear at least in Edward Johnson's Wonder Working Providence: "So here behold the Lord Christ, having egged a small handfull of his people forth in a forlorne wilderness, stripping</page><page sequence="19">The Face of God 33 them naked from all human helps, plunging them in a gulph of miser ies, that they may swim for their lives through the Ocean of his Mercies, and land themselves safe in the armes of his Compassion."83 Cotton Mather, too, identifies the "American Desart" as a place where the settlers "found they must live like strangers and pilgrims."84 To those exiled from England, God's smile meant everything; his aban donment could cause hysteria and despair. In this light, the sense of cohesion that marked early settling in the wilderness becomes significant. It suggests an attempt to reconstitute home and family by a brotherhood of orphans. The recurring motif of the hedge and wall in Puritan sermon literature symbolized God's pro tection, and served to restore, perhaps unconsciously, the missing physi cal protections of English homes.85 More significant are the profuse instances of parent-child meta phors to characterize the relation of God and man. Edward Taylor con sciously exploited the connection. In "Gods Determinations," Justice and Mercy are clearly parental figures who offer conditional and uncon ditional love, as well as being the more easily recognized types of Old and New Testament God. Man in his "Lapst Estate" is "like a Child that fears the Poker Clapp/Him on his face doth on his Mothers lap/ Doth hold his breath . .." (p. 389). Calvin, too, explained the role of the Church in mother-child terms: "There is no other way of entry into life, except that we be conceived by her, born of her, nourished at her breast, and continually preserved in her care and under her government. . .."86 God-as-parent was not unique to Puritans, of course, but they seized all the available metaphors and invented more to build a model for self-identification. The image of the child in Puritan writing has both doctrinal and psychological resonances. Edward Taylor combines both in a definition of "adoption." His usage derives from well-estab lished church tradition; it is similarly defined by Ames and Calvin. "Adoption,"' Taylor writes, "is a gracious Act of God, passt upon a true believer in Christ, whereby, translating him out of Satan's famaly, as a Childe into his own houshould, he constitutes him a rightfull heire of all the privilidges of his own child."87 Still other factors invite comparison of aspects of Puritan behavior and thought with the mental activity of young children. One is the belief in magic: in witches, demons, and angels. Another, more subtle, is the belief in the adult's omnipotence, a fantasy underlying the Puri tan belief that a saint could save an entire community.88 The saint, whom the Puritans saw as a "type" of some biblical patriarch like Moses, Joshua, or Daniel, was the hope of the community, his death a judgment upon it. In John Fiske's elegy for Samuel Sharpe, death has caused "this breach in fam'ly greate, in church, in Towne/who each be</page><page sequence="20">34 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 reft as of a Father now/are forc't to wayle. ."89 Not only was Sharpe a "Father" to the entire community, but "our sin the cause" of his death. Similarly, in Urian Oakes's elegy on the death of Thomas Shep ard, the speaker laments, "Our sins have slain our Shepard! . . ." and he urges New England to "feel this blow; / . . . Lest it be said, with him New-Englandfell!"90 A larger version of the same myth, or collective fantasy, was that Adam doomed the race and Christ rescued it. Without painting (except for a few portraits), theatre, or statuary to project the ideals and taboos of the culture, the need to see God was likely aggravated, the creative impulse driven underground. We know that children today, spared from tales of monsters, witches, and giants by overprotective parents, will simply invent their own versions of them.91 Similarly, in the absence of pictorial or dramatic representations of God, Puritans strained after visions and voices, as only a small sam pling of sermon titles suggests: A Vision Concerning the Mischievous Seperation, The Vision of Divine Mystery, A Vision of Hell, Une grande voix du Ciel, Hades looked Into, The Heavenly Conversation, A Vision in the Temple, A Voice from Heaven, The Voice of God in a Temple, Voice of the Dove.92 Kenneth Murdock has written about anxiety as an influence on lit erary forms, attributing the Puritans' exaggerated interest in histories and, more particularly, in biographies, to their "crisis" condition: The greater the crisis, the greater the need; the more the Puritans felt that their crises were major and special, the more diligently they pored over histories, sacred and pro fane. Biography could, probably, be even more useful. A Dutch scholar, Professor Jan Romein, suggested in his Die Biographie,* that an interest in biography and the writing of it is stimulated in periods of crisis.93 Under the twin pressures of anxiety and repressive cultural institutions, Puritan art, like the censored fairy tale, surfaced in other forms. Norman Grabo, we have seen, noted its resurgence in Puritan literature. Images that were banished from the churches reappeared in carvings on tomb stones. Ludwig explains the need for visual imagery on gravestones as a literal corrective to God's transcendence and to the language of verbal abstraction offered by the church: "The emerging formula concerning the use of symbols in New England seems to have amounted to this: the more transcendent the God, the greater the need for visual imagery. As the avenue of subjectivity narrowed, a boulevard of symbolic imagery appeared. The more verbal the formulas of the institutionalized church the more the multitudes strove to express the 'nouminal' immediacy of spirit in their stone icons."94</page><page sequence="21">The Face of God 35 Psychoanalyst Ernst Kris makes an observation nearly identical with Ludwig's. He notes that the art forms in cultures where idols were wor shipped changed significantly when there was a breakdown of faith. Ab stract forms became scarce and there was a marked preference for literal representations of the god-image.95 Kris's findings offer a possible con nection between anxiety and pictorialism in art forms, and provide an other key to understanding the Puritans' preoccupation with visualizing God's face and bodily parts. If Puritans saw themselves metaphorically as children, and God as their beloved parent, the withdrawal of His love would cause them con siderable anxiety. His abandonment coupled with their physical isola tion in the wilderness led them, most likely, to seek ways to reconstitute His image, already in their imaginations, but now in more visible, con crete forms. If we consider the Puritans' identification with the child, we are no longer surprised at the frequency in Puritan works of images of the parent's face and bodily parts. Psychoanalytic studies done by Rene Spitz and others show that the mother's face is the first important stage of object relations, or love.96 The importance of comfort and security at tached to the early nursing experience has been explained in lay terms by Selma Fraiberg: Through repetition of the experience of nursing and its regular accompaniment, the hu man face, an association between nursing and the human face will be established. But more than this, the pleasure, the satisfactions of nursing become associated with the hu man face. Repetition of this pleasurable experience gradually traces an image oftheface on the surface of the memory apparatus and the foundations of memory are established. When the mental image is firmly established the visual image of the human face is 'rec ognized." . . .97 Most striking is the fact that when the mother's face fails to appear at ex pected times, the infant experiences a state of anxiety. Spitz identifies this phenomenon, or the pattern called "eight-month anxiety," with the first manifestation of "anxiety proper, " or that which is experienced by adults.98 In each case the anxiety develops from a feeling of being abandoned by the beloved parent. What has all this to do with Puritan anxiety? Could God on some unconscious level be a displacement of "mother"? Ludwig has noted the frequency of breasts and gourdlike images on tombstones.99 And Edward Taylor, we recall, urged God to suckle him: Lord put these nibbles then my mouth into And suckle me therewith I humbly pray, Then with this milk thy Spirituall Babe I'st grow .... (p. 354)</page><page sequence="22">36 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 John Cotton's Milk for Babes, which rivalled the Shorter Catechism in popularity, used the metaphor of the breast as a source of nurture and love in its running title: Milk for Babes. Drawn Out of the Breasts of Both Testaments. Chiefly for the spirituall nourishment ofBoston Babes in either England But may be of like use for any Children (Boston, 1646). In the first stanza of a short autobiographical poem, Cotton ex presses gratitude to his divine Parent: In mother's womb Thy fingers did me make, And from the womb Thou didst me safely take: From breast Thou hast me nurs'd my life throughout, That I may say I never wanted ought.100 Samuel Willard similarly titled his book on spiritual benefits The Child's Portion (Boston, 1684). Through marriage to Christ, Willard wrote, "we are made the Children of God." '10 Jonathan Edwards, like John Cotton, identifies milk in terms of the mother-church: "Milk rep resents the word of God from the breasts of the church, that is not only represented as a woman but of old was typified by heifers, the goats, etc. Milk by its whiteness represents the purity of the word of God; it fitly represents the word because of its sweetness and nourishing nature, and being for the saints in their present state, wherein they are children. 102 In Anne Bradstreet's "Meditations Divine and Moral" the Christian is not only being weaned away from earthly pleasures, but quite literally from mother. Although she denies the value of sensual longings, Brad street's choice of metaphor is telling. Puritans are clearly identified with a child reluctant to be weaned, and God with their maternal parent: "Some children are hardly weaned; although the teat be rubbed with wormwood or mustard, they will either wipe it off, or else suck down sweet and bitter together. So is it with some Christians: let God embit ter all the sweets of this life, that so they might feed upon more substan tial food, yet they are so childishly sottish that they are still hugging and sucking these empty breasts. ... 103 Robert Daly notes the familial con text of Anne Bradstreet's relation to God: " ... Thou art my Creator, I Thy creature, Thou my master, I Thy Servant. But hence arises not my comfort, Thou art my Father, I Thy child; . . ."104 A corresponding sense of the comforting parent is projected by Edward Taylor in "Gods Determinations": Christ's motherly aspect is striking: Peace, Peace, my Hony, do not Cry, My Little Darling, wipe thine eye, Oh Cheer, Cheer up, come see. Is anything too deare, my Dove, Is anything too good, my Love To get or give for thee? (p. 414)</page><page sequence="23">The Face of God 37 Even assuming Christ was an aspect of "mother," could a community of highly intellectual adults manifest behavioral patterns or relive the psy chic states of young children, even of infants? According to Freud, such regressive behavior occurs commonly in adults when frustration or ex treme stress forces the libidinal impulse back to the more comfortable positions of early childhood.105 Regression is a psychological retreat to a time of life associated with comfort and security, with the protection of a loving parent. For Puritans, God was the supreme parent, what Freud called an "exalted father.'' 06Jean Piaget also observed the child's iden tification of parent with God: "The child in extreme youth is driven to endow its parents with all of those attributes which theological doctrines assign to their divinities-sanctity, supreme power, omniscience, eterni ty, and even ubiquity. "107 Childhood, then, was less a condition of age than one of dependency and self-doubt.108 For members of the second and third generation of American Puri tans, self-doubt and fear of punishment were a way of life, a cultural heritage. "The religious message of the 1650's through the 1670's told the young that they were a corrupt generation divided from God-per haps even abandoned by Him forever-and that there was nothing they could do themselves to 'make up for' the 'vague deeds' that had brought their ruin."'109 Emory Elliott examines the sources and expres sions of this anxiety in his Power and the Pulpit in Puritan New Eng land. Significantly contributing to the belief that their sins had caused New England's troubles were Puritan childrearing practices. Children lived with constant threats of physical torment, early death, and separa tion from both earthly and heavenly parents, as the consequences of dis obedience. These threats were adumbrated in sermons for children, books for children, and in manuals for ministers and parents on good childrearing methods.110 In addition to these fears, Puritan children had to contend with their literal ejection from home at the age of eight or so, for it was the common practice to send children to live with other fami lies for a number of years as apprentices or servants.111 So constant and pervasive was the threat of punishment by an angry God, and so deeply felt was the concomitant wish to be loved and ac cepted, that the child-parent drama was endlessly replayed, with its own happy ending: the stern, censuring father was converted into a tender, loving mother. Of course this was an imaginative solution, and it found expression in Taylor's dramatic personae, Christ, Mercy, and the Saint. It also expressed itself, I believe, as a need to see God's face, and to cor rect anxiety and doubt with visible, literal forms. Erik Erikson has observed that a child who has experienced extreme self-doubt and parental censure will usually exhibit an overdeveloped</page><page sequence="24">38 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 conscience, repetitive or obsessive patterns of behavior, and a tendency in adult life to govern "by the letter."112 And, as Elliott notes, these traits have frequently been cited to define the Puritan character. In fact, they were encouraged by Puritan parents.113 Anxiety and self-doubt may indeed be the forces that produced the absolute, rigid forms that define Puritan "aesthetics"-the fondness for pictorialism, literalness, geometrical patterns, Ramist dissections, and scale models of the New Jerusalem. The poems of Edward Taylor and Michael Wigglesworth, however joyous or woeful, were written in tight, mechanical rhymes and to the beat of the metronome. Even Anne Brad street's lyric moments are contained within a highly organized structure dividing her subjects into units of four. She ponders the four elements (fire, earth, water, air); the four humors in man's constitution (choler, blood, melancholy, and "Flegme"); the four ages of man (childhood, youth, middle age, old age); the four seasons; and the four monarchies (Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, Roman). A similar geometry shaped the Puritan elegy in the designs of anagrams, acrostics, and shape poems.114 Sermons were divided and subdivided, then subdivided again, accord ing to the principles of Ramist logic, so that the most abstract principles became neatly diagrammed and made visible.115 Samuel Willard's view of the spiritual tensions in the believer were so clearly set forth that they could be anatomized in the following diagram:16 Diagram of the Shape of the Christian Life Spirit: The Image of God Justification Sanctification Glorification Hope: Antici- Joy pation Despair: Horror Love: Quest for Partici- union pation/ Hatred: Affective alienation Faith: Basic Memory trust Unbelief: / Guilt Flesh: The Image of Sin</page><page sequence="25">The Face of God 39 John Cotton, Thomas Shepard, and Thomas Hooker used a visible con version scale to measure man's progress toward grace.117 Darett Rutman reviews the phases-sin, preparation, and assurance-through which a Christian passes to his salvation. The last two stages are further divided into ten steps: (1) attendance upon the Word; (2) submission to the moral law (the Commandments); (3) awareness of one's sins; (4) fear of the consequence of sin; (5) consideration of the promises of salvation propounded and published in the Bible; (6) a spark of faith, a will and desire to believe; (7) doubt and despair of salvation; (8) doubt, but also a feeling of assurance and a persuasion of mercy; (9) a grief for sin be cause it is sin (not because of its consequences); and (10) grace to en deavor to obey God's commandments. On the visible scale the first four stages represent Preparation, and the remaining six represent Assurance. But because this scale only represented man's visible condition, another scale was needed to chart the progression of the saint's life from God's perspective. Although there were five basic concepts-election, voca tion, justification, sanctification, and glorification-only three were measurable. (The first was before time, and the last beyond time.) In this second scale "V" (vocation), "J" (justification), and "S" (sanctifi cation) stand as fixed points:118 V J S Without attempting to relate the Puritans' methods of assessing their own progress or that of their neighbors, or attempting to review the scholarly commentary about these scales, I would simply like to call at tention to the existence of visible scales to measure intangibles. The need for schematic arrangements was omnipresent. Puritan sermons anatomized sin, categorized sinners as "sheep" and "goats," faulted the "inward" and "outward" man, drew up blueprints of heaven, and pictured its layers and inhabitants. Puritan portraiture was characterized by the flat, heavily outlined "neomedie val" style of the limners.119 Tombstone art was, despite the varied styles, noticeably symmetrical, the dominant image centered, and with identi cal carvings on the vertical columns, or pilasters. Edward Taylor provides a model of the repetitive, schematic quality of Puritan sermons and Puritan poetry. Even a flower could be geome trized: Suppose we then that this Glory of heaven conferred upon the Saints was Com pared unto a Most Curious perfumed Rose that should be as big as the Whole Creation of God from the Centre of the earth to the Circumference of the Highest heaven, set with so many folds of flowers one in an other &amp; one upon another as shall fill it from the Centre to the Circumference with leaves no bigger than the fourth part of a leafe of a Rose flower, &amp; on every of those leaves there were printed in figures of Gold as many milians of years as minuts from the beginning to the end of the world .. .120</page><page sequence="26">40 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 In Taylor's poetic sequence, "Gods Determinations," Mercy answers Justice by offering to take up Man's debt, meanwhile measuring the im measurableness of her love for the poor sinner: If more a thousand times too little bee Ten thousand times yet more than this I'le do: What, though ten thousand times, too little bee? I will ten thousand thousand times more do. Though this ten thousand thousand times much more Though doubled o're and o're for little go, I'le double still its double o're and ore And trible that untill I make it do. (pp. 392-93) Not only is Taylor preoccupied with calibrating the infinite and circum scribing heaven in the concentric petals of a rose but he seems obsessed with "Poles" and "Parallels," the finitude of numbers, charts and maps, the symmetrical groupings of sinners into first, second, and third ranks, the successive pairings in the debates of each act-Justice and Mercy, Soul and Satan, Soul and Christ, Soul and Saint-the "anato mizing" of sin in "Inward Man" and "Outward Man." In the same poem, imaginary arrows map the inroads of fear as the doubting soul looks "within," " Without," "Above," "Below," "Before," "be hinde." The pattern repeats in the twenty-second poem: Above an angry God! Below, black-blew Brimstony flames of hell where Sinners rue! Behinde, a Traile of Sins! Before appeare An Host of Mercies that abused were! Without a Raging Divell! and Within A Wracking Conscience Galling home for Sin! (p. 431) These geometric qualities, repeated in various patterns of syntax, dic tion, and image, argue Taylor's need for form and order as a means of making concrete the intangibles of the New England Way. But beneath the sure neatness of lines and diagrams, there is a general blurring of is sues. The three ranks of sinners are never clearly differentiated; they are simply named. And despite the frequent references to "anatomizing" sin, there is no real sense of what sin is, except in terms of too much as surance or too much doubt. Such absolute forms seem to compensate for an overload of uncer tainty and ambiguity. As Ludwig has suggested of tombstone carvings, visual images made a too transcendent God more immanent. Similarly, Kris notes that as faith waned in primitive cultures there was a corre sponding rise in direct, representational art forms. Both the forms and their function then needed to be labelled for the worshippers. And Ber</page><page sequence="27">The Face of God 41 covitch connects the visionary certainty of the apocalyptic sermons of the 1690's with growing doubt about salvation. Again, the projection of a fixed notion (in this case, of coming joy) seems a corrective for present uncertainty and despair. To briefly summarize: cultural isolation, actual physical danger (In dian attacks, smallpox, starvation), and the fear of failing in their wil derness mission likely contributed to a broad regressive phase in Purtan culture, marked by belief in magic and devils, fantasies of parental vengeance and retribution for the sins of errant children, and an acute longing to regain the love of the missing parent, to see God's face. The most dramatic manifestation of this need was the frequent attempt in Puritan writing and artifacts to anatomize God, to dwell imaginatively on His corporeal parts, to visualize His dwelling place and His attending angels. Such a need may explain in large measure the peculiar literalness of Puritan "aesthetics," the tight frames of logic and of symmetrical forms in poetry and sermons, and the graphic representations of death and resurrection in tombstone carvings. Despite cultural injunctions, the need for art and self-expression showed itself in covert forms of drama and painting. And it likely contributed to the apocalyptic visions in Puritan sermon literature and to the hallucinatory phenomena that were sometimes signs of saving grace. Inseparable from Puritan aesthet icism is the "covert" factor: the disclaimer, the deliberately crabbed style, the self-effacing gestures that sought to reconcile piety with crea tivity, the homely metaphors that concealed and revealed the rich vigor of early American art.

Their members were "visible saints," people who supplied proper evi dence-usually a mystical experience-of their election. See Edmund S.

Daly's thesis is that Puritans did indeed love the sensual world, but that they loved God more. He systematically refutes the assumptions that (1) the Puritans were hostile to art; (2) that their poetry was otherworldly and abstract; (3) that they objected to sensuous imagery; and (4) that their poetry was not and could not be symbolic. 28 Samuel Mather, The Figures or Types of the Old Testament (1683), 2nd ed.

Daly considers why Taylor's metaphors break apart and why all metaphors fail, finally, to bridge the gap between man and God. See also Louis L. Martz's discussion of Taylor's "deliberate roughness," in his Foreword to Poems of Tay lor, xviii-xxi; and William J. Scheick, The Will and the Word: The Poetry of Edward Taylor (Athens, Ga., 1974), pp. 129-30 n. Martz relates Taylor's inarticulateness to a tradition of humility practiced by the metaphysical poets; Scheick considers lisping inar ticulateness the proper stance for a child of God. 37 Edward Taylor's Christographia, ed.

Quoted in Tichi, "Thespis and the 'Carnall Hipocrite'," p. 97. 43 The first act begins with a debate between Justice ("Like to a Rampant Lyon new assaild, / Array'd in Flaming fire") and Mercy ("meeke / As any Lamb"), person ifications of Old and New Testament aspects of God. The second act comprises three agons between the Soul and Satan, who casts off his "Angels Coate" to appear "With Griping Paws, and Goggling Eyes .. . / Like some fierce Shagg'd Red Lion, belching fire." Between bouts the Soul is comforted by Christ. Passions abate in the more rea soned working out of church doctrine in the third act, a dialogue between Soul and Saint, but they swell ecstatically in the lyrics of the final act. In these seven paeans to Christ, the saints-"like a Bride all Gloriously arraide" in the metaphorical Wedden Garment "Of Sanctuary White"-ride to glory in Christ's coach. 44 Some of the confusion over Taylor's sources is suggested by the following description: "Gods Determinations may be called a medieval morality play patterned on classical pastoral drama and written by a Renaissance metaphysical poet" (Willie T.</page><page sequence="30">44 Early American Literature, Volume XIV, 1979 Weathers, "Edward Taylor, Hellenistic Puritan," American Literature, 18 [1946], 23). Weathers argues that much of Taylor's long poem is modeled on the Greek pastoral lyr ics of Theocritus. Nathalia Wright suggests its source is in the morality tradition of Mil ton, Spenser, and others of the Cambridge group ('The Morality Tradition in the Poetry of Edward Taylor," American Literature, 18 [1946], 1-17). Jean Thomas suggests yet earlier origins in the homiletic drama of the Middle Ages ("Drama and Doctrine in Gods Determinations," American Literature, 36 [1965], 452-62). Taylor's motives, as well as his sources, have been the subject of much debate. Those who argue for Taylor's orthodoxy include Johnson, Stanford, Grabo, Colacurcio; against it, Miller, Murdock, Pearce, Wright, Black, Weathers, and Lind. As Karl Keller notes, the debate "seems to have been fairly decided in favor of orthodoxy. ..." See Sacvan Bercovitch, ed., The American Puritan Imagination: Essays in Revaluation (New York, 1974), p. 234 n. 45 Stanford notes, "Taylor published none of his poems. However, stanzas five and seven of 'Upon Wedlock and Death of Children' . . . were printed after the last page of Cotton Mather's sermon Right Thoughts in Sad Hours, London, 1689" (Poems of Taylor, p. 499). Some 400 pages of manuscript verse, evidently bound by Taylor ,himself, were discovered in 1937 by Thomas H.
