<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIALOGUE I Semantics, Pragmatics, and Narrativity: A Response to David Rudrum MARIE-LAURE RYAN In his article "From Narrative Representation to Narrative Use: Towards the Limits of Definition," David Rudrum argues that definitions of narrative based on what the text represents are fundamentally flawed: "As long as narratology remains tied to [a conception of narrative as representation], and tied to a philosophy of lan- guage that foregrounds signification above and before questions of use and practice, it seems that a satisfactory way of defining and classifying its subject matter will continue to elude it" (203). Here, in a nutshell, is the argument. Narrative has tradi- tionally been defined as the representation of a sequence of events. But this defini- tion fails to capture the distinction between a set of instructions for building model airplanes (Figure Two in the text) and what Rudrum regards as a genuine narrative, namely a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip (Figure One). To distinguish the narrative status of these two representations of sequences of events, we must take into consid- eration how the text is used. Defining narrative, in this perspective, consists of spelling out the rules of a specific "language game," to invoke, as Rudrum does, the celebrated metaphor through which Ludwig Wittgenstein anticipates speech act theory and current inter- est in questions of language use. Rudrum is not trying to tell us that what a text rep- resents-its content, its signified-is irrelevant to its narrative status: "Perhaps [a representation of a sequence of events] is a necessary condition of narrative, but it A native of Geneva, Switzerland, Marie-Laure Ryan is an independent scholar based in Colorado.

Something more is needed to make a text a narrative" (198). But he regards context and use as far more important constituents of a definition than what the text is all about: "What gets identified as narrative (or not), is first and foremost a function of social conventions, rather than exclusively formal or linguistic concepts" (200; my emphasis). In other words, semantics plays second fiddle to pragmatics. In this response, I would like to defend the primacy of semantics over pragmat- ics for the definition of narrative by taking a critical look at two of the arguments on which Rudrum builds his case. THE "READING AS" ARGUMENT To describe narrative as a language game (or more precisely as a semiotic game, since Rudrum's examples come from the graphic domain) means that a given textual object can be put to several different uses, one of them "narrative," and the others something else. A text, in this view, is like a deck of cards: depending on the rules, you can use it to play Bridge, Canasta, Poker, or Hearts, and the rules of these games do not entirely depend on what the cards represent: kings could be replaced with cows and queens with horses, and the four suits could be bells, flags, acorns and coats of arms, without impact for the rules of the game, as long as suits are arranged in a specific hierarchical manner. In speech act theory, similarly, you should be able to take a proposition, for instance "the cat has food," and performs different illocu- tionary acts with it: assert it, ask about it, order it, or make it the object of a promise or threat. It would of course have to be a very big cat, and you or one of your loved ones would have to be the meal, for "the cat has food" to form a credible threat (not to mention embedding in an if... then construction): here the concrete situation and the particular reference determines the usability of the propositional content. This is precisely what Rudrum wants to tell us about narrative: the narrativity of a text depends on the context.' To make his point, he imagines communicative situations that make it possible to read Figure Two as a story, and Figure One as a set of instructions. But what are the rules of the narrative game? Though Rudrum never spells them out, we can reconstruct them from two sources: (1) his unequivocal labeling of Fig- ure One as a story; and (2) his attempt to read the airplane instructions as narrative. According to Rudrum, Figure One "'tells' (if that is the right word for pictorial nar- ratives) a brief but amusing story about a boy who takes a nasty tumble and covers it up by pretending to have executed a deliberate gymnastic maneuver of some kind" (187). In this narrative reading, Rudrum does much more than building a mental rep- resentation of a sequence of physical events: he assumes that the events have a defi- nite and common participant--it is the same boy who appears in all the frames-, and he infers mental states-intents and emotions-thanks to which the mere phys- ical movements of the boy's body participate in a meaningful human experience. This experience involves: an accidental happening that demonstrates clumsiness, a feeling of shame over this demonstration of a negative feature; a desire to cover up</page><page sequence="3">190 Marie-Laure Ryan the clumsiness; the mimicking of a physical action that requires a great deal of coor- dination, and a feeling of self-satisfaction over the whole scheme (expressed by the triumphant scream: "ta-daa"). Through the boy's clever action, the initially embar- rassing situation of displaying clumsiness has been successfully transformed, for hy- pothetical observers, into a demonstration of great athletic skills. None of the mental events presupposed by Rudrum's paraphrase is explicitly represented in the text, but they are implied by it, and without reconstructing them, the text would not make nar- rative sense. In contrast to the events shown in Figure One, those of Figure Two strikingly lack the fundamental narrative feature of a definite participant. Anybody could exe- cute the instructions and place himself in the role of agent. There is consequently no need for all the actions to be executed by the same person. And while Figure One represents a presumably unique, or at least extraordinary occurrence of events, Fig- ure Two suggests that the events shown on the pictures can be repeated over and over again--by anybody who buys a model airplane kit and follows the instructions. The two figures also differ in the mode of presentation of the events: in Figure One, we imagine them as happening right now in front of us. (Images always speak in the pre- sent.) In Figure Two, there is no guarantee that the events will ever happen: it all de- pends on the will of the user. Figure One presents events in the assertive (or constative) mode, which implies occurrence; Figure Two presents them in the com- mand mode, which implies possibility but not actuality. All these differences make Figure Two inadequate as a story. Rudrum partly concurs with this judgment ("I would venture to suggest that a reader endowed with what narratologists have called 'narrative competence' is ex- tremely unlikely to identify Figure Two as narrative at all" [197].). But this is not his last word on the topic: he insists that it is only because of our familiarity with the cul- tural habit of building model airplanes and of placing instructions in the construction kit that we do not routinely see a story in Figure Two. "Figure Two... could quite easily be a pictorial narrative of a construction project, for example. Archaeologists many years hence might well interpret it as a piece of artwork documenting, com- memorating, or celebrating the building of such an object" (198). To arrive at this so- called "narrative" reading, Rudrum does not only attribute to the text a different illocutionary force-constative rather than instructive-and build a new context- archaeologists finding Figure Two inscribed on some sort of information storage de- vice by a long lost civilization, without any readable explanatory text-he also imagines content which is neither shown nor implied by the text: a civilization proud of a technological feat, individualized agents (the plane must have been built by somebody!), a memorable rather than routine event, and emotional reactions to this events (wishing to commemorate and celebrate it). It could be argued that the very legitimate narrative reading of Figure One also involves imagining what is not ex- plicitly represented in the text; but there is a big difference here: in Figure One, in- ferring intents and emotions is necessary to the understanding of this text; moreover, by showing a human figure, the text implies the existence of a mind and of particular mental events. In his narrative reading of Figure Two, by contrast, Rudrum has gra- tuitously brought foreign elements into the picture and no less gratuitously ignored</page><page sequence="4">Semantics, Pragmatics, and Narrativity 191 some of its visual features: why doesn't the picture show any humans building the airplane, if it commemorates this important feat? In short, Rudrum has not read the text as a story, but rather, constructed his own story around the sequence of events depicted in Figure Two through highly selective procedures. What this reading demonstrates, then, is not that a given text can be used as either instructions or nar- rative, but rather, that stories can be built around instructions, as they can be built around, and embed, virtually any kind of statements: descriptions, judgments, com- ments, reflections, philosophy. 2 To complete the demonstration of the dependency of a narrative reading on con- textual factors, Rudrum invites us to imagine that the four frames of Figure One are part of an instruction book, such as a manual for clowning techniques: "In this case a reader might well be forgiven for interpreting it as a series of step by step instruc- tions showing trainees clowns how to raise a laugh by taking a tumble" (202). This reading subtracts many of the elements that we have found in the narrative interpre- tation: no more pretenses, no more emotional reactions-the expression on the face on frame 3 is now scripted role-playing, as is the exclamation "ta-daa." But a quick look at Figure One makes the instructional interpretation highly unlikely. Why isn't the character dressed as a clown? How do we know that the tripping is intentional and that the goal is to raise a laugh? Where is the laughing audience? Can we really learn how to tumble from what is shown of the position of the body? It would take an explanatory caption to find out exactly what instructions the student clowns are sup- posed to derive from the images. The lesson to be learned from the extraordinarily contrived character of these transcategorial readings is that content offers a stubborn resistance. Rudrum has cer- tainly loaded the dice in his favor by his particular choice of a cartoon that fore- grounds body movements. Even so, we have to add to the text, subtract from it; in short, turn it into another text to ignore the story of Figure One, and to find one in Figure Two. It may be the case that both instructions and narratives represent "se- quence of events," if we take "represent" as meaning something like "calling to mind" rather than "asserting the past, present, or future occurrence of events," but it does not follow from the insufficiency of the thumbnail characterizations quoted as epigraphs to Rudrum's article that a working definition of narrative must be predom- inantly based on context and use. Why couldn't we simply narrow down the event- based definitions by asking narrative to present the dimensions that we found in the regular readings of Figure One but not of Figure Two? If this is not enough to make a general distinction between narratives and commands (advices, instructions, direc- tions, recipes, etc.), we can associate narrative with the mandatory global illocution- ary force of assertion (i. e. telling as fact). As David Herman writes about instructions for baking frozen pizza, "Given their illocutionary status as commands, the sentences [in the example] outline a bare pattern for potential events, a skeleton plan for action ... .The sequence therefore tells us not what happened, in the manner of a story, but rather how to make something (good) happen, in the manner of pre- scription, or, more precisely, a recipe" (Story Logic 88, my emphasis). If instructions are "bare patterns for potential events," we can regard the content of some com- mands as virtual stories. In the Odyssey, for instance, Nausicaa instructs Odysseus to</page><page sequence="5">192 Marie-Laure Ryan perform a series of actions which would yield a complete narrative episode if they were told as facts (as they are later when Odysseus executes the plan) rather than being presented in the command mode.3 By making assertion into the distinctive speech act of narration, we introduce a requirement pertaining to use into the defini- tion, but I believe that the bulk of the definition remains solidly grounded in the con- tent of the representation, this is to say, in the semantic domain. THE MULTIPLE USES ARGUMENT This argument inverts, and consequently negates the first one. The "reading as" argument told us that narrative is only one of the various language games that we can play with a given textual representation. Now we are told that narrative lends it- self to a variety of games: "Consider the following commonplace narrative forms: confessing one's sins in church; writing an accident report while completing an in- surance claim form; and testifying against a murderer in court. In all three cases, it is possible to see a representation of events here. But if we assume this representa- tion is an inherent property of these speech acts qua narrative, rather than, say, a re- quirement imposed on them by social institutions and conventions in which they are spoken/written, we may well court a charge of naivet6" (200). At the risk of appear- ing indeed naive, I'd like to ask: how does Rudrum know that these uses of language all constitute narratives forms (as he labels them unambiguously), despite the vari- ety of their uses? What I see here is a collection of different speech situations and social institutions that require a speech act of assertion whose propositional content satisfies the semantic conditions of narrativity. In the "reading as" argument, narra- tive was one of the variable uses of a representation, and the content of the repre- sentation was a constant. Now narrative is a constant that brings various uses and speech situations under a common denominator. Narrative theory can have it one way or the other, but making narrative into both a variable and a constant is plain contradiction. Rudrum quotes in his support a formula by James Phelan that he regards as a definition: "the act of somebody telling somebody else on a particular occasion for some purpose that something happened" (200; Rudrum's emphasis). But the words in italics are hardly specific to narrative: all acts of communication take place on a specific occasion for a particular purpose. What makes Phelan's formula into a can- didate for a definition of narrative is "telling somebody that something happened": a certain content (something happened) presented through a certain illocutionary mode (telling, a synonym for asserting).4 But since occasion and purpose are left in- determinate, they are not distinctive, and consequently not definitional. I am quite puzzled by Rudrum's statement "Yet it does not follow [from the de- sire to provide a neat definition] that any one formula based on one type of language use (representation, in this case) can successfully delimit the frontiers of narrative, given the sheer variety of different uses to which narratives are put" (202). Is Rudrum trying to say that there are too many uses of narrative to incorporate them into a definition? Then I fully agree-but this contradicts Rudrum's main thesis. Or</page><page sequence="6">Semantics, Pragmatics, and Narrativity 193 is he suggesting that representation is only one of many uses, and that it cannot form the core of a definition? What Rudrum fails to see in this case is that all of the uses he mentions (reporting an accident, testifying against a murderer, confessing one's sins) involve representation. Precisely because the uses of narrative are so varied, we cannot work them into the definition, and we must rely instead on what the text represents. If uses were the cornerstone of the definition, either we would have to describe them all, an impossi- ble task, since new ones pop up every day (computer games; reality TV), and since narrators can never control what narratees will do with their stories; or we would have to privilege a single use, for instance fictional narrative, or what Mary Louise Pratt calls the "narrative display text," blatantly excluding such cases as confessions extracted under torture, or stories told to explain theoretical physics. It is rather symptomatic of this problem that Rudrum does not venture to sketch the use-based definition that he is pleading for. At this point I would like to contrast narrative with a genuinely pragmatic cate- gory whose definition in no way depends on what the text represents. This category is fiction. Transcategorial readings are much more feasible between fiction and cer- tain genres of nonfiction, such as biography and autobiography than between narra- tive and anything else. A case in point is the novel Marbot by Wolfgang Hildesheimer, which, according to Cohn (79), fooled an early reviewer into taking it for the biography of a historical character. DEFINING NARRATIVE, AFTER ALL It is far from my intent to deny the importance of use for narrative theory. One of the consequences of the emancipation of narratology from what David Herman calls the classical paradigm has been an increased awareness of the socially situated nature of narrative communication. The recent interest in embedded narrative may very well be due to the fact that framing devices reflect on the uses to which the framed story is put within the storyworld. But a definition is not a theory: the former should be succinct, the latter encompassing. That a pragmatic component has a legit- imate place in narratology, besides the well-developed study of discourse and the still underdeveloped study of story, does not mean that the uses of narrative can be worked into a definition, and much less that they should make this definition "water- tight," as Rudrum wants it to be (cf. the quote in note 1). We may in fact question the need for a watertight definition: why couldn't nar- rativity be a scalar property rather than a strictly binary one, and narrative a fuzzy set allowing different degrees of membership, but centered around prototypical cases that everybody recognizes as narrative? In a scalar conception of narrative, definition becomes a series of concentric circles that spell increasingly narrow conditions, as we move from the outer to the inner circles, and from the marginal cases to the pro- totypes.5 The list below proposes a tentative formulation of these nested conditions (the ordering becomes freer toward the bottom of the list, as the conditions shift from semantics to pragmatics):</page><page sequence="7">194 Marie-Laure Ryan (1) Narrative must be about a world populated by individuated existents. (2) This world must be situated in history and undergo changes of state. (3) The changes of state must be caused be external events, not by natural evo- lution (such as aging). (4) Some of the participants in the events must be human or anthropomorphic agents who have a mental life and react emotionally to the states of the world. (5) Some of the events must be purposeful actions by these agents, i.e. the agents must be motivated by conflicts and their deeds must be aimed to- ward the solving of problems. (6) The sequence of events must form a unified causal chain and lead to closure. (7) Some of the events must be non-habitual. (8) The events must objectively happen in the story world. (9) The story must have a point. When they are put to the question, "is this text a narrative," some people will be satisfied with conditions 1 through 3 and classify a text about the Big Bang as a story,6 while others (Fludernik) will insist that narrative must be about human experience, and will consider (4) and (5) obligatory. Some people will regard a diary reporting routine actions as a narrative while others will insist on (6) and (7). Those who accept recipes as narratives consider (8) optional; and there are scholars who draw the line after (9) (Bruner), while others (Prince "Revisiting", Ryan "Narrative") think that a pointless utterance can still be a narrative. But if people differ in opinion as to where to draw the line, my contention is that they basically agree about what requirements are relevant to narrativity and about their importance relative to each other. The different ways to draw the frontiers of narrative do not carry significant cognitive consequences, because when we read a text, we do not ask "is it or isn't it a narrative," nor even "to what extent does this text fulfill the conditions of narrativ- ity." Asking people to make this kind of decision is one of those artificial situations in which phenomena are produced by the act of investigation. Here I concur with Mieke Bal: "Usually, we don't doubt, don't wonder, about the status of a text, and watching a film we may or may not be carried away, but hardly does it seem impor- tant to ask if what we are seeing is in fact a narrative" (20). Assessing the narrative status of a text is not a cognitive question that we must consciously answer for proper understanding, but a theoretical question that enables narratologists to define the object of their discipline, to isolate the features relevant to their inquiry, and to stem the recent inflation of the term "narrative"-an inflation that threatens to make it synonymous with "ideology," "interpretation," "explanation" and simply "mes- sage" (Prince "Revisiting" 45). If defining narrative has any cognitive relevance, it is because the definition covers mental operations of a more narrow nature than passing global judgments of narrativity: operations such as asking in what order the represented events occur; what changes do they cause in the depicted world; what do the events (and their re- sults) mean for the characters; what motivates actions and how does the outcome of these actions compare to the intent of the agent. If a text confronts us with such</page><page sequence="8">Semantics, Pragmatics, and Narrativity 195 questions, and if we are able to answer them, we read the text as a story, whether or not we reflect upon its narrative status. This contrasts with the pragmatic concept of fiction. Identifying a text as a fiction has a crucial impact on how we read it; and de- spite the existence of what Dorrit Cohn calls "signposts of fictionality"(109-31), this identification cannot always be made on the basis of the content or formal fea- tures of the text. Fiction is a category that operates top-down-we must assign it to the text in order to read it correctly-while narrativity operates bottom-up: we let the text itself reveal its narrative status, as we attend to the story. ENDNOTES 1. I take this term of narrativity in Prince's sense: "Narrativity-the set of properties characterizing nar- rative and distinguishing it from non-narrative" (Dictionary 65) and not in the specialized sense that Rudrum reads into it in his critique of Prince's and my (supposed) approach to narrativity: a "structural interrelation between the various parts of a narrative whole" [198]). Rudrum argues that "the concept of narrativity does not give us enough to distinguish a narrative text from a non-narrative one, nor to formulate a watertight definition of narrative, any more than does the concept of representation" (199); but why should narrativity make such a distinction? It is no more than an umbrella term for the set of features that define narrative, and it does not in itself say anything about the nature of these features. 2. Many passages of the Illiad and the Odyssey contain for instance detailed accounts of the building of objects, and the stories may very well have served a secondary instructional purpose. 3. Here is the example: "Now then, stranger [says Nausicaa to Odysseus]... I will take you to my wise father's house, where I promise you shall become acquainted with all the best men in the nation. But this is what you must do: ... So long as we are still in the country among the farms, you must follow smartly with the maids behind the cart, and I will lead the way .... You will find a fine grove of Athena close to the road, poplar trees, with a spring bubbling up inside and a meadow all around .... Sit down there and wait long enough for us to get into the city and reach my father's mansion. When you think we have got there, enter the city yourself and ask the way to the mansion of Prince Alcinois. .... When you are within the house, you must enter the hall and pass quickly until you come to my mother; she is a sight worth seeing! . . . My father's throne is placed near to hers, and there he sits quaffing his wine like a god! Pass him by, and lay your hands on my mother's knees, that you may see the day of your home-coming, and be happy soon, even if you come from a long way off." (The Odyssey, 78-79; the disclosure of the whole plan takes about two pages.) In Ryan Possible Worlds (chapter 8), I call this type of script a "virtual embedded narrative," for it may or may not be actualized. 4. I personally think that this definition is too narrow, because it limits narrativity to diegetic presentation through language, and excludes dramatic enacting (i.e. the mimetic mode), but this is beside the point. 5. One scholar who advocates a scalar approach is Fotis Jannidis. For him, the set of all narratives con- tains both prototypical forms, comparable to robins in the bird family, and non-prototypical forms, comparable to ostriches and penguins. According to Jannidis, the robin of the narrative family is oral storytelling, while the penguins and ostriches are stories represented in other media, such as comic strips or film (40). I take this idea further by suggesting that not only do different media differ from each other along a scale in their ability to represent stories, but that story itself can be realized to vari- able degrees within a given medium. 6. For instance this text: "The universe started out as cold and essentially infinite in spatial extent. Then an instability kicked in, driving every point in the universe to rush rapidly away from every other. This caused space to become increasingly curved and resulted in a dramatic increase of temperature and en- ergy density. After some time, a millimeter-sized three-dimensional region within this vast expanse created a superhot and dense patch. The expansion of this patch can account for the whole of the</page><page sequence="9">196 Marie-Laure Ryan universe with which we are now familiar." (Adapted from Brian Greene, 362). When I asked people if this was a story, some said yes and some said no. But if I had asked: which text is more narrative: this one or Little Red Riding Hood, I think the response would have been unanimous. WORKS CITED Bal, Mieke.
