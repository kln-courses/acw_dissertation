It presents the results of the analysis and interpretation of the materials recovered. Furthermore, it is the first report on Project B, part of a coordinated research program centered on the interrelationships of New World cultures (Ekholm and Evans, 1962). This research program was supported by a National Science Foundation grant, and sponsored by the Insti- tute of Andean Research and the American Museum of Natural History. A second report on the archae- ology of the Tonala area, coastal Chiapas, will follow at a later date. It is impossible to express sufficient gratitude to Dr. Gordon F. Ekholm, American Museum of Natural History. As principal investigator and director of Project B, he not only made the field work possible, but also supervised the preparation of this monograph. He joined me for three weeks in Tehuantepec, where I particularly appreciated his help in selecting the sites to be excavated and his active cooperation during the initial phases of the excavations. Later, while I was writing this report in New York, he generously offered advice and constructive criticisms. I also acknowledge with thanks the assistance of Dr. Eusebio D'avalos Hurtado, Director of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Mexico City, and other members of its staff, especially Dr. Ignacio Bernal and Mr. Rom'an Pifia Chan, who extended many favors to me, provided working space, and also examined the sherd collection. Throughout my stay in Tehuantepec I enjoyed the companionship of Mr. Thomas MacDougall, a botanist from New York, who arranged for our accommodation in Tehuantepec and found guides. I availed myself of his botanical knowledge in gathering data on the vege- tation of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. I am particularly indebted to Mr. Robert E. Smith, Peabody Museum, Harvard University. I was privi- leged to work under his guidance for ten days in Mexico City, during which time I learned the many conceptual and technical aspects of the Type-Variety taxonomic system on which the following ceramic analysis is based. Dr. James A. Ford, American Museum of Natural History, was of great help in pre- senting his own views on typological classification, and was kind enough to assist in establishing the bar-charts. Among those who also contributed in varying de- grees to the realization of this report, I wish to thank several members of the scientific staff of the American Museum of Natural History: Dr. William K. Emerson and Mr. William E. Old, Department of Living In- vertebrates, for undertaking the identification of the mollusk shells; Mr. David M. Seaman, Department of Mineralogy, for identifying the rocks and mineral pig- ments; Dr. George G. Goodwin, Department of Mam- malogy, for identifying the faunal remains. Dr. Harry L. Shapiro, Chairman of the Department of Anthro- pology, was kind enough to put working space and other Museum facilities at my disposal. For these I am deeply grateful. I acknowledge with gratitude the valuable sugges- tions and critical comments about possible culture link- ages between Tehuantepec and other archaeological areas offered by Mr. Jose Luis Franco of Mexico City, who examined the sherds and figurines. I also appre- ciated the brief but expert examination of the sherds by Dr. Michael Coe, Yale University. My thanks are also extended to Dr. Paul Tolstoy, University of Montreal, who examined some lithic implements, to Mr. Robert Sonin of New York, who analyzed some ceram-iic slips and refired some sherds, and to Dr. James C. Gifford, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, who sent me all the pertinent literature on the Type- Variety taxonomic system. In Tehuantepec, the hospitality and unflagging help of Dofia Florinda Cabrera and Don Geronimo Rojo greatly facilitated our work. My thanks are also due to Mr. Robert G. Stairs, Summer Institute of Linguistics, Tehuantepec, who drove me twice in his battered old jeep into the Huave area, and to Mr. Nicholas Amorosi, American Museum of Natural History, for the skill and patience he exer- cised in preparing the text figures. Finally, I am particularly indebted to Miss Bella Weitzner, American Museum of Natural History, for editing the manuscript, and for her expert assistance in improving its style.

The ultimate aim of the 1960 study, however, was to furnish a body of data that would broaden our knowledge of the origins and diffusion of cultural complexes and ways and means of communication be- tween the Mesoamerican and Andean culture centers. Project B of the Institute of Andean Research is one of a series of archaeological surveys and excavations conducted from 1960 through 1962 along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Ecuador. It was devised to examine the role of the relationships between these two centers of high civilization. Final evidence on the nature and intensity of such interrelationships will not be made available until the data gathered by all par- ticipants in the project are studied and compared. Our task in 1960 was to conduct investigations on the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, where, until very recently, no acceptable archaeological work had been done. Our work was initiated by a five- week survey in this archaeologically little-known area, with a view to ascertaining its potentialities. We con- centrated our efforts on the western part of the Pacific Plains, in the area between the foothills and the western lagoons. Little time was devoted to the Huave area, because lack of transportation limited us there. Nu- merous sites were plotted on the map. Sites with Formative culture affiliations are extremely scarce. Classic and Postclassic sites are relatively numerous. Cultural deposits are generally shallow. Our survey failed to locate any of the coveted and elusive Early or Middle Formative sites. Delgado (1961, and per- sonal communication) encountered some Middle For- mative sites, among others, in Juchit'an, and possibly at El Zapotal near Union Hidalgo, where he found an Olmec carved stone figurine. From the knowledge acquired through the site survey and the study of the topographical and ecological envi- ronments, we infer that Formative sites are likely to be found several kilometers inland from the present coast line or the borders of the lagoons. The Late Forma- tive sites we found are situated to the south and north of the San Diego hills, near the right bank of the Tehuantepec River (fig. 1). The majority of Classic sites, on the other hand, seem to lie between the coast line and the foot of the Sierra in areas which were probably not flooded during the rainy season. Post- classic sites are usually located on still higher ground along the base of the Sierra, but also on the shore of the lagoons. Generally speaking, during a large part of its his- tory, the Tehuantepec region seems to have been an area through which cultural elements diffused. In the light of archaeological material recovered, its role as a cultural center appears to be almost nonexistent. However, some autochthonous artistic developments, in particular the figurines, reached a fairly high and aesthetically interesting level in Late Classic times. That portion of the Tehuantepec area with which we are primarily concerned, seems to have been just off the main thoroughfare which links the Valley of Mexico to Guatemala. Therefore it was apparently more often a recipient or a transmitter than a source of cultural innovations. 5</page><page sequence="5">6 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

Indeed, a wide gap separates the Tehuantepec area from them. Brief surveys in this intervening zone revealed the presence of many prehistoric sites. Their excavation would in all probability provide the missing links. While tracing cultural relationships and pinpointing possible sources of cultural stimuli, we were confronted with another major problem which had to be taken into consideration, that of natural routes for migrations, trade, and cultural diffusion. The ethnographic and historical sources of information on past military cam- paigns and trade exchanges between "ethnographically present" communities of Southern Mexico cast some light on these problems. The era of archaeological investigations on the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, other than those generated by mere antiquarian curiosity, may be said to have opened in 1808, when Dupaix (1834: 1: pp. 6-8) visited Guiengola and other parts of the Pacific Plains. Guiengola has since remained a center of at- traction for those visiting the Tehuantepec area. In 1840 Arias, then mayor of Tehuantepec, in a letter to one of his friends, wrote an objective and fairly accu- rate description of several archaeological specimens found in the vicinity of Tehuantepec and others which he found in a tomb he had opened at Guiengola (de Leon, 1843). In 1859 Brasseur de Bourbourg spent several months in Tehuantepec. We are almost certain that his description of a site which he visited on the outskirts.of Tehuantepec refers to the Lieza site (Bras- seur de Bourbourg, 1861a: p. 197). He imagined that it was in this place that the Palace of Cocijopi, the last king of Tehuantepec, once stood. Brasseur de Bourbourg may therefore be credited with first drawing our attention to the importance of the Lieza site which we were to dig. Maler (1942-1947) re- ports on gold, copper, stone, shell, and clay artifacts retrieved from a tomb accidentally opened in Tehuan- tepec in 1875. The artifacts consisted mainly of lip, ear, and nose ornaments, rings, gold turtles, painted clay jars, shell bracelets, and probably jade necklaces. Seler in 1896 also made the Guiengola pilgrimage. He published a general account of its architectural features along with several plans (Seler, 1904). In 1938 Martin Baz'an, who was then on the staff of the Insti- tuto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, planned to work extensively at Guiengola and had the trees felled over a large area. However, he did not carry his plans any further. This clearing of the site was fortunate; it made it possible for Thomas MacDougall to take a series of excellent photographs. Miguel Covarrubias, a faithful visitor to Tehuantepec, in the thirties and early forties believed that Lieza was a promising site. He intended to do some excavating. However, he was unable to carry his plans through because of lack of funds (MacDougall, personal communication). In 1953 Forster ( 1955) attempted to trace the relation- ships of the western Pacific Plains to other areas in Mesoamerica on the basis of a surface collection of potsherds and figurines. Until 1958 no systematic excavations had been attempted in this area. In that year, Agustin Delgado, a staff archaeologist at the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, tested several sites in the Juchitan region. Delgado was able to outline the history of the Juchitan region from the Middle Formative through the Postclassic (Delgado, 1961). It is indeed unfortunate that unpropitious cir- cumstances prevented us from examining the Juchit'an materials to compare them to our own. Turning now to our own work, we selected two sites which we believed would yield an adequate and uninterrupted ceramic column, namely, Lieza on the outskirts of Tehuantepec and Boca del Rio near the lower reaches of the Tehuantepec River. The latter site should not be confused with the site of the same nanmte in the state of Veracruz. Whereas Lieza essen- tially represents the Classic Period, Boca del Rio proved to be affiliated principally with the Late Formative. The reader should bear in mind that the field work in 1960 was exploratory rather than exhaustive; there- fore, the conclusions drawn from it are preliminary rather than final. THE ENVIRONMENT The Isthmus of Tehuantepec comprises that portion of Mexico which lies between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, where the distance between the two seas is only 220 kilometers. The Isthmus includes the eastern part of the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca. Most of it lies between 94 and 95 degrees West Longi- tude. Both coasts of the Isthmus have a generally east-west orientation (fig. 2). Topographically, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec can be described as having two main slopes which meet at Tarifa-Chivela to form the continental divide. The Isthmus comprises three divisions. The first, the Atlantic Plains, extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the base of the Sierra; it is a long sloping plain, 175 kilometers wide, with an extremely low gradient. The second, the central division, is a low mountainous area, formed by the sudden decline in the altitude of the mountain range which crosses the Isthmus; the Sierra dips from 3,400 meters (Cempoaltepetl) to 244 meters at Tarifa-Chivela, and rises again eastward to 1,200 meters (Atravesado). The third division, with which we are concerned, comprises the Pacific Plains, which account for about 18 per cent of the total width of the Isthmus.</page><page sequence="7">8 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

Map of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and adjacent regions. The Isthmus of Tehuantepec faulted down to its present level during the Late Pliocene uplift, since which time it has been cut off from the Mexican plateau; the scrap of mountain range of Oaxaca repre- sents the point of fracture (Schuchert, 1935: p. 131). Schuchert (1935: pp. 54-55) suggested that this faulting caused a seaway to open between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Recent studies, however, have provided good geologic evidence that there was no such waterway across the Isthmus (Duellman, 1960: p. 45). Orographically and physiographically the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, including the Sierra Madre del Sur, be- longs to Central America, which is separated from North America by the volcanic range which stretches from Colima to the Tuxtla area (Garfia and Chapin, 1949: p. 8; Thayer, 1916: p. 90; Tamayo, 1941: pp. 228-229). It is worth mentioning here that no volcanic activity occurred in the south-isthmic area during the Pleisto- cene. It appears also that the Isthmus had been little affected by bioclimatic fluctuations which prevailed during that period (Duellman, 1960: p. 46). During the last glacial maximum, vertical displace- ments of tropical zones in southern Mexico and north- ern Central America attained a height of 1,000 meters. But despite these dramatic climatic fluctuations and biotic shifts, biological evidence indicates the existence of a tropical environment throughout the glacial maxi- mum in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (Duellman, 1960: pp. 45-49).</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE ENVIRONMENT 9 THE PACIFIC PLAINS OF THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC GEOLOGY The Pacific Plains include an area of old low-lying rocks, principally pre-Carboniferous archaean crystal- lines (Thayer, 1916: p. 93). The exposed rocks located between the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico occur in five parallel belts (Baker, 1930: p. 162). Only the first two concern us. The first belt, near the Pacific, is a basement complex of metamorphic rocks and intru- sives composed of granite, microgranite, felsite, quartz, porphyry, granite-gneiss, schists, and serpentines. This base stretches from the Pacific littoral to the height of Juchit'an. The second belt, which extends from Juchi- t'an to the continental divide, consists of folded forma- tions of phylites, schists, sandstones, quartz-schists, limestones, slates, and partly marbleized limestones. All these formations contain numerous lenses and veins of quartz. SEISMOLOGY Tremors occur so frequently in the Pacific Plains that little attention is paid to them. Their high frequency, however, did not fail to impress Motolinia while he was residing in Tehuantepec in 1533 (Motolinia, 1956: p. 130). The Pacific coast of Oaxaca has one of the high- est incidence rates in the world for tremors and earth- quakes. Seismic foci are located off the coast of Oax- aca in deep oceanic trenches and are responsible for the frequent quakes and for occasional tidal waves which have swept over the Pacific Plains destroying towns and villages (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 387; Gadow, 1908: p. 176; Tamayo, 1949: 1: p. 274). This factor cannot be overlooked in our attempt to understand the ecology and archaeology of the region, because it may account in part for the virtual absence of Early and Middle Formative sites near the seacoast. TOPOGRAPHY The Pacific Plains (fig. 1) average 25 km. in width, from the foot of the mountain range to the shores of the lagoons, and about 45 km. to the Pacific coast line. The gradient of the plains is very gentle, varying be- tween 2 and 4 meters in one kilometer, and forming a remarkably smooth, even surface sloping toward the sea (fig. 87). The monotony is broken occasionally by irregularly dispersed and isolated hills and hillocks, often conical, which form a prominent feature of the landscape. These hills attain a height of 300 meters. The plains themselves are covered with an alluvium of quartz sandstone, sand, light loam, mollusk shells, marls, and modern clays. Underlying this alluvium, layers of clay alternate with layers of fine sand and gravel; the clays sometimes lie on the surface, some- times at a depth ranging to 12 meters. Alluvial depos- its in some areas rise several meters above the plains (Moro, 1844: p. 66; Sapper, 1937, p. 93; Bose 1906: p. 19). DRAI NAGE The Pacific Plains are drained and intersected by eight small rivers of limited length. Seven, such as the Perros, Chicapa, or Ostuta, discharge the water of the southern slopes into the lagoons which are con- nected to the sea by a narrow channel called the Boca Barra. The eighth river, the Tehuantepec or Loteca, as it is sometimes designated on old maps, flows in a southeasterly direction and has its source high in the Sierra Madre del Sur; it discharges directly into the sea at Ventosa Bay. All the rivers are subject to great annual overflow, causing large tracts of land to be temporarily inundated. In the dry season nearly all the rivers dry up or are absorbed in the sands of the plains. The flow of the Tehuantepec River, which carries a substantial volume of water during the dry season, has been controlled for irrigation purposes for the past twenty years. Exceptionally high floods do occur once in a while. In 1944 four barrios of Tehuan- tepec were washed away when the Tehuantepec River overflowed its banks (Oaxaca en Mexico, 1944). The main lagoons extend along the beach for a dis- tance of nearly 65 kilometers. A narrow peninsula separates them into two main divisions, the Upper Lagoon or Duic Quialoi, and the Lower Lagoon or Duic Quialiat. These lagoons are generally shallow, averaging 5 to 6 meters in depth; the bottom is soft mud and sand. The Upper Lagoon is studded with islands, some fairly high, such as Monopoxtiac, which rises to 111 meters. In moderate weather the sea breaks a mile from the beach, producing a surf which is impossible for small boats to pass (Shufeldt, 1872: pp. 97-98). PAST TOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES In the not distant past, the lagoons covered a much larger area than they do now; the Pacific Plains, now so dry and parched during the rainless months, were partly covered with fresh and brackish ponds and lakes of considerable extent. This is borne out by the pres- ence of fresh- and salt-water varieties of mollusk shells on the surface and to a depth of one meter, species still found living in the waters of the lagoons and the ocean (Moro, 1844: p. 102), and by the numerous turtle remains in our excavations at Boca del Rio. Miih- lenpfordt (1844: 2: p. 177) observed swamps and marshes between Tehuantepec and the seacoast at the beginning of the last century. We must also mention that in the past the Pacific Ocean swept much closer to Tehuantepec. In Burgoa's time, the beach was less than 12 kilometers from Tehuantepec (Burgoa, 1674: 2: pp. 340, 395; Paso y Troncoso, 1905a: p. 291); today it is 17 kilometers. Topographical evidence and</page><page sequence="9">10 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. aerial photographs also demonstrate that the Tehuan- tepec River shifted its course several times in the past, the last time in 1861, emptying sometimes in the sea and sometimes in the Upper or Lower Lagoons (Moro, 1844: p. 25; Orbegozo, 1861: p. 36). Meandering as it did, the Tehuantepec River probably obliterated pos- sible archaeological sites either by washing them away or by covering them with alluvium. This picture of the past, however, fails to provide any clues as to whether or not optimum ecological conditions for human settlement existed. Since no studies of beach lines have been made in southern Mexico, we are uncertain as to whether the disappearance of lakes and ponds is due to alluvial sedimentation or to a general upheaval of the Pacific Plains. Since this phenomenon is of too recent a date, we must rule out the possibility of a change in sea level. From our own observations, we infer that the whole coast is gradually rising. In support of this inference, we cite the formation of three terraces along the Tehuantepec River, north of the Lieza site. These terraces were formed by sinking of the river bed due to erosion as the river cut through the rising ground (fig. 88). CLIMATE The climate of the Pacific Plains is given by Con- treras (1942: table 31) as C(ip) A'(a'); the formula is modified from that of K6ppen. The characteristics, are rainy tropical climate with dry rainless winters and springs, rainfall confined to the summer months with a minimum of 750 millimeters, mean annual tempera- ture maintaining itself above 18 degrees centigrade in every month of the year, and xerophytic vegetation (Tamayo, 1949: 2: p. 57). The temperatures recorded at Salina Cruz for the 1941-1950 period are (United States Weather Bureau, 1959); Mean annual temperature 27.60 C. Mean monthly temperature of the hottest month, May 29.90 C. Mean monthly temperature of the coldest month, January 25.60C. During the hottest month, May, the thermometer may soar to 33 degrees centigrade at 7 A.M. During the coldest month, January, it may stand at 26.6 degrees centigrade in the shade. Compared with the Pacific Plains, the climate of the central division is radically different. When the thermometer stands at 30 degrees centigrade at Tehuantepec, it scarcely rises to 13 de- grees centigrade at Tarifa-Chivela. This enormous difference is noteworthy, considering that the Tarifa- Chivela area is only 244 meters higher than the Pacific Plains. The rainfall recorded at Salina Cruz for the years 1941-1950 is (United States Weather Bureau, 1959) Mean annual precipitation 1,094.9 mm. Mean monthly precipitation for June 256.7 mm. Mean monthly precipitation for September 266.6 mm. Information on precipitation for the Pacific Plains is often incomplete and sometimes conflicting. It seems, for instance, that Tehuantepec, only 22 kilometers north of Salina Cruz, receives 60 per cent less rain than Salina Cruz (Sapper, 1932: p. 62). At Salina Cruz rainy days average 57 per year, with the overwhelmiing majority in June and September. The driest months are from November through May, with an average rainfall of fewer than 7.5 millimeters. Precipitation is subject to extreme variations; for ex- ample, during the ten-year period, 1941-1950, four years show an average of 730.4 millimeters each. Our first reaction was to expect important cultural implica- tions in these fluctuations in precipitation, mainly as they would influence maize growing. We discussed this problem with Dr. Robert L. Carneiro, American Museum of Natural History, who drew our attention to the fact that 730.4 millimeters of rain spread over a period of four months is sufficient to produce one crop of maize. This would apply to Salina Cruz, but Tehuantepec, which receives 60 per cent less rain, and the region north of it, would irremediably suffer from crop failures. There is evidence that this happens frequently. In 1961, for instance, the maize crops were a total loss. Two prevailing winds, the so-called "Norther" and the southeasterly wind, are predominant during a large part of the year on the Pacific Plains. The "Northers" blow from October to April, reaching their peak of intensity in November. The southeasterly winds pre- vail during June, July, and August. The "Northers," generated during the winter months by masses of moisture-saturated air from the Gulf of Mexico, are cooled in their westerly course while ascending the slopes of the central division, and finally deposit their moisture on the mountains of the central division. While passing through the bottleneck of the Isthmus, they gather tremendous speed and blow with galelike violence on the Pacific Plains, raising dust and sand storms, but they carry no rain. They cause minor eolitic sedimentation and erosion which can be observed from Salina Cruz to Tonala (Miullerried, 1948). The "Northers" are especially strong in the Huave area, where sand dunes are formed. Cortes lost a brigantine which ran aground and foundered at the Boca Barra as the result of such a gale (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 400). There are only two seasons on the Pacific Plains, a dry season and a wet season. The latter is heralded by thousands of butterflies which form saffron-colored clouds about ten to fifteen days in advance of its onset</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE ENVIRONMIENT 11 No wonder that Tlaloc, the rain god, is often repre- sented as a butterfly. THE BIOTIC ENVIRONMENT Burgoa (1674: 2: pp. 339-340) was greatly im- pressed by the richness of the flora and fauna of the Pacific Plains, and he wrote a vivid description of it. The south-isthmic area is part of a larger bio-geo- graphic unit termed the "Tehuantepec biotic province," which occupies the arid coastal strip of Oaxaca, the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and con- tinues southward along the coast of Chiapas to beyond the Guatemala border. It also includes the arid area extending eastward from the Isthmus along the valley of the Grijalva (Goldman and Moore, 1946: p. 358). This biotic province is characterized by two main classes of floral environment designated as savanna and tropical deciduous forest (Starker, 1950: pp. 507 ff.; Bravo, 1960: pp. 31 ff.). Two environments which are extremely limited in range are the mangrove swamps and the palm groves (MacDougall, personal communication). The dominant plants of the savanna are coarse tropical grasses; scattered trees are irregularly spaced over the grassland. The savanna, which consists of flat land with poor drainage, becomes partly water- logged during the rainy season. This type of environ- ment, which is found mainly in the southern part of the Pacific Plains, is interspaced with thickets of tropical deciduous trees along the Tehuantepec River and around depressions which contain water throughout the year. The tropical deciduous forest which forms a crescent- shaped belt around the savanna is usually confined be- tween the savanna and the Sierra, and as mentioned, is also found interspaced in the savanna (fig. 1). As the name deciduous implies, the trees of this type of forest lose their foliage during the dry season. The tropical deciduous forest is represented by two types of vegetation, a true tropical deciduous forest and a thorn forest characterized by trees and bushes with tiny leaves and spines. In general, the true tropical deciduous forest occupies the more humid foothills; the thorn forest is more coastal, but both are normally intermingled. Arborescent cacti form part of this vege- tation, as does the underbrush which consists mainly of thorny bushes and small cacti, which form an almost impenetrable tangle in many areas. Mangrove swamps are found along some portions of the lagoons. One palm grove is found north-northeast of Juchitain. FLORA In order to obtain first-hand information on the ethnobotany of the Pacific Plains, a full day was spent with Thomas MacDougall and Francisco Ortega, a Zapotec, roaming the area at the foot of Guiengola in search of useful plants and trees. Among the hundreds which we came across, only those which are best known and are native are described. Trees favored for con- struction purposes are: the brazil (Haematoxylum bra- siletto); the campeche (Haematoxylum cam pechia- num); the mahogany or caoba (Swietenia ina.crophyl- Ila) ; the cascalote (Caesalpinia), an ebony-like tree, whose fruits are used for tanning; the silk-cotton tree or ceiba (Ceiba pentandragaerm), the dominant tree of the tropical deciduous forest, the seed of which fur- nishes kapok fiber; the guapaquie (Dialiumz guianense), the best of all timber; the guichitachi (Pereskia con- 2cattii), a tree endemic to the Pacific Plains and Guate- imala; the guirisinia or gutiri-xina (Cordia eleagnoides), one of the most common trees; several varieties of oaks; and the pinioncillo (Jatropha curcas), used to make fences. Several trees furnish dyes: the achiote (Bixa orellana) (scarlet) ; the Brazil (red) ; the indigo (In- diyofera suffructicosa), of which there is a wild and a domesticated species; the palo amarillo (Bocconia arborea) (yellow); the palo mora (Chlorophora tiu1c- toria) (black); and the palo verde (Parkinsonia acu- leata) (green). Resins, oils, and gums are extracted: copal from the copal tree (Protium copal) ; sweet gum or balsam from the liquidanbar (Liquidanibar); gum arabic from the mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) ; a substi- tute for soap comes from the jaboncillo (Sapindius saponaria). Fruits and tubers, which nowadays are imiportant items of diet, are varied and abundant on the Pacific Plains. Suffice it to mention the chavote (Sechiurn edule) whose fruits, tendrils and roots (ciuesa) are eaten; the chile (Capsicnim), which often grows wild; the ciruela (Cyrtocarpa edldis), of which there is a wild and a domesticated species; the glta- chipilin tree (Diphysa robinioides), the flowers of which are eaten; the jicama (Pachwrrhizus); the niamney (Calocarpum mammoson); the manioc (Manihot ditl- cis); the papaya (Carica papaya); sweet potatoes or cawtotes (Ipomoea batatas); tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentumi), of which there are several wild varieties; the yellow zapote (Pouteria campechiana). The staple dietary plants are the cultivated maize (Zea mays) and the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Hennequen or ixtle (Hennequen) of both a wild and a domesti- cated species is used to make thread, ropes, mats, bag- ging, and hammocks. Cotton (Gossipum hirsutum) is rare, though there are several domesticated and one wild variety. The folk pharmacopoeia lists among others, the guaco (Mikania guaco) which has astrin- gent qualities and is an antidote for serpent bites; the bark of the palo mulato (Zanthoxylum), which serves as a substitute for quinine; and the sarsaparilla (Smi- lax). Dozens of other plants are used for specific purposes: the palo de peine (Dalbergia funera) is used to make fine-toothed combs; the gulawere (Cordia dentata) to make glue; the volador (Amphypteryngium adstringens) to make wooden dolls; and the cintul or</page><page sequence="11">12 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. chintule (Sprekelia formosissima), a rush, to wash clothes or for personal ablutions. Data on maize and bean cultivation are lacking. Shufeldt (1872: p. 116) observed that "the corn grown on the Pacific Plains is indifferent, and that the ears are nothing more than nubbins, and that the best yield &lt;does not exceed 15 bushels to the acre." Shufeldt also reports small-scale irrigation and remarks that the supply of water is scanty (Shufeldt, 1872: pp. 107, 116). FAUNA Animal life was richly represented a century ago; the number of species has sharply declined since then. The most numerous beasts were the jaguar (Felis onca), the puma or mountain lion (Felis concolor), the ocelot (Felis pardalis), and the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Tapirs (Tapirella) were found in great numbers in the upper reaches of the Chicapa and Ostuta rivers. Peccaries (Tayassu) were also com- mon. Large hordes of spider monkeys (Ateles) used to inhabit the area around Niltepec. Cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanes), brockets (Mazanma aeri- cana), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were present in large numbers. Also worth mention- ing are the coati (Nasna narica), the common oppos- sum (Didelphis mnarsupialis), and the nine-banded armadillo (Dasyphus novemncinctus). The latter is highly esteemed as food on the Pacific Plains. Among the amphibians there are 6 species of frogs and toads, and 9 species of snakes that are restricted to the Pacific Plains (Duellman, 1960: p. 42; Hartweg and Oliver, 1940: p. 10). Iguanas (Igttana) are still eagerly hunted. Turtles are occasionally hunted. Alli- gators (Caimian and Crocodylus acutus), which used to clutter the lagoons and ranged as far as Jalapa del Marques, are now virtually extinct. The Huaves venerated alligators as spiritual brothers and sisters. Lagoons, rivers, and the sea contain an astonishing variety of fish, crustacea, and shellfish, all consumed in large quantities by the present population. Shrimp, in particular, caught by the ton provide one of the basic foods of the Huaves. Bird life comprises predators such as eagles, vultures, and buzzards, bevies of passeriformes, some scansorials. Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), partridges, pi- geons, and chachalacas (Cracidae) are the most im- portant of the gallinacea. Among the palmipeds we -find various kinds of ducks. The cultivation of nopals (Nopalea cochenillifera) for raising cochineal and the keeping of stingless bees are practices now virtually abandoned. Wild silk used -to be gathered by Zapotec women and woven into fabric which was sold with high profits. GEOLOGICAL RESOURCES As we have already mentioned, fine-grained meta- morphic rocks are especially abundant on the Pacific Plains. The prehistoric inhabitants made use of sev- eral kinds of rocks and minerals that are not found on the Pacific Plains, but come from the peripheral re- gions, especially from the central division of the Isth- mus of Tehuantepec. Some of these rocks and minerals have a direct bearing on archaeology. Quartz (milk quartz and jasper) is found in abundance in the form of veins and lenses at Tarifa-Chivela; jasper is found especially at Guichicovi, Tarifa, and Niltepec, and specular hematite at Chivela, where it occurs in veins 10 to 12 centimeters thick. We have as yet found no archaeological evidence of the use of tecalli which is abundant in the vicinity of Tequisistlan (Lozano, 1949: p. 29). Gold deposits in any form are virtually unknown in the south-isthmic region. The nearest source of copper and silver seems to be Chalchichintepeque hill, 12 kilometers from Nejapa, where these two metals are found in combi- nation (Paso y Troncoso, 1905b: p. 42). ADJACENT AREAS OF THE PACIFIC PLAINS Let us turn our attention to the land and topography surrounding the Pacific Plains. The coastal strip stretching south-southwest along southern Oaxaca be- longs to the Tehuantepec biotic province. It is formed by a series of high promontories jutting into the sea and interspersed with coves and marshes. To the west, the Pacific Plains are bounded by the Sierra Madre del Sur, which rises abruptly above the plains. The Sierra Madre del Sur, which occupies most of the state of Oaxaca, with an average elevation of 2,400 meters, is a highly dissected tangle of folded mountain ranges lying generally east-west, with an occasiolnal peak rising to great height. "The mountains here are so rugged and difficult, that they can hardly be crossed, even on foot," remarks Cortes in one of his letters after his men who had been sent to conquer the area met with near disaster (MacNutt, 1908: 2: p. 198). WVe cite this realistic description of the Sierra Madre del Sur to stress one important point, the difficulty of access. In the past it seems to have loomed as a formidable barrier, hindering rather than facilitating trade and cultural diffusion between the Valley of Oaxaca alnd the Pacific Plains. The central division of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, to the north of the Pacific Plains, is 244 meters high at its lowest point. However, this low altitude is the barrier between the xerophytic vegetation of the Pacific Plains and one of the densest and most humid tropical rain forests on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The central division consists of high table-lands and rolling plains separated by irregular ranges of hills projecting from the Sierra. Its plant cover consists of temperate, warm, and tropical climate species. In some of the higher districts the rains continue almost throughout the year.</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 13 To the east-southeast, the Pacific Plains are bounded by the highlands of Chiapas. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The following historical outline is presented to ac- quaint the reader not only with this background mate- rial on the Tehuantepec area, but also with specific problems which confronted us in the course of our studies, and which we believed could best be solved through historical research. A case in point is the often-debated problem of natural roads for migrations, trade, and cultural diffusion. For example, the study of the historical sources on the territorial conquests that led to the formation of the Culhua-Mexica empire provided us with important clues to the traditional roads of communication between the highlands and the lowlands of Mexico. Another controversial topic relates to the origin of the Huaves. EARLY HISTORICAL MIGRATIONS The sequence of historical events in which the Pacific Plains were involved begins with the arrival at Tehuan- tepec of some Toltec people who fled thither after the fall and destruction of Tula in 1168, an event which began a series of far-flung migratory movements. Ac- cording to Ixtlixochitl (1891, 1: pp. 55-56), some Toltecs, fleeing before the invading Chichimec hordes, went into exile in Huatimala (Guatemala), Tecuan- tepec (Tehuantepec), Cuauhtzacualco (Coatzacoalcos), and Campeche. We believe it probable that these Toltec migrants and their descendants managed in some way to retain their identity and their language for several decades. Our belief is borne out by the follow- ing historical fact. Animated by his desire to emulate the Tula kings, Xolotl, the leader of the Chichimec who settled on the shores of Lake Texcoco in 1244 (Jimenez Moreno, 1954-1955: p. 228), shortly before he made Tenayuca his capital, decided to become master of all the land formerly ruled by the Toltec kings. To this end, four of his captains set out to take possession of these territories. After a lapse of nearly five years, the four emissaries returned and reported to Xolotl that they had met and were welcomed by Toltec people "on the South Sea coast," in Tecuantepec (Tehuan- tepec), Tototepec (Tututepec), and Cuauhtemallan (Guatemala) (Ixtlixochitl, 1891: 1: pp. 88-89). We are aware that, plausible as our inference may be, the identification of these Toltec with the descendants of those who fled from Tula needs further elucidation. We ignore the fate which later befell those early Toltec migrants and their descendants; they were probably absorbed by the indigenous populations, in all likeli- hood the Huaves, the Mixes, or Zoques. THE MIXTEC-ZAPOTEC WARS The succeeding series of events is of primary impor- tance, because it concerns the appearance and settle- ment of the Zapotec in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Consequently, it contributes greatly to our understand- ing of the sequence of cultures and ethnic groups on the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Toward the close of the thirteenth and at the begin- ning of the fourteenth century, Mixtec invaders, through wars and intermarriages, succeeded in im- planting their authority and culture in several Zapotec towns of the Oaxaca Valley, in particular in Zaachila (Teozapotlan) and Mitla. They even availed them- selves of the existence of Zapotec tombs for the burial of their dead. In the wake of hostilities that flared up, some Zapotecs fled to Tehuantepec. The Relacion de Cuila,pa which mentions the event specifies literally " . estos (the Mixtec) tuvieron guerra con los de teocapotlan los quales reconosciendo ventaja de estos se huyeron a tierra de teguantepec, . . ." (Barlow, 1945: p. 25); the latter sentence, in all likelihood must be interpreted as referring to either the vicinity of Tehuantepec or the region of Tehuantepec. The Zapo- tec flight can be dated with fair accuracy by reconciling the evidence as recorded in historical, linguistic, and archaeological sources. Fr. Agustin de Salazar, writing in the Relaci6n de Cuilapa in 1581, states that the event occurred some 300 years earlier, around 1281. Burgoa furnishes corroborative evidence for the presence of Zapotec in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. In his Geo- grafica Descripci6n, written in 1671, he remarks that Jalapa (a town 30 kilometers northwest of Tehuan- tepec) was conquered by Zapotec from the Huaves over 300 years before, or some time before 1371 (Burgoa, 1674: 2: pp. 328, 339, 397-398). Although Burgoa gives no reason for the conquest of Jalapa and does not allude to the Tehuantepec region, we conjecture that he refers to the same historical event, namely, that a group of Zapotec, defeated by Mixtec, escaped to the Pacific Plains. The time interval indicated by these two dates, A.D. 1281 and A.D. 1371, can be narrowed to some extent on the basis of glottochronological data. Swadesh's lexico-statistical studies of the Zapotec lan- guage have shown that the dialect spoken on the Isth- mus branched off from that spoken in the Mitla area 600 years ago, or about A.D. 1360 (Fernandez, Swadesh, and Weitlaner, 1960: p. 144), and thus they add to the theory of a cleavage in the Zapotecan population in the fourteenth century. Finally, the identification of the archaeological phase of the Mixtec culture which corre- sponds to Monte Alban V, and the assignment of A.D. 1350 for its beginning, also have an indirect bearing on the problem, since both facts testify to the time of the Mixtec intrusion into the Valley of Oaxaca. If we now piece the several parts together, the inci- dent refers to a group of Zapotec who were driven out of the Valley of Oaxaca around 1350, and sought refuge in Jalapa, which they took from the Huaves. It is worth mentioning that this Zapotec colony, surrounded by hostile populations, the Chontals, the Mixes, and</page><page sequence="13">14 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the Huaves, preserved its linguistic integrity, and was probably responsible for spreading the dialect which is still spoken on the Isthmus today. Contacts with the Valley of Oaxaca were re-established under the reign of Zaachila III, king of the Zapotec, in the second half of the fifteenth century (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: p. 384). ANAHUAC TRADE AND MEXICAN WARS By the middle of the fifteenth century, the increasing economic reliance of the Valley of Mexico on the exte- rior, the intensification of commercial prospecting, and the desire to gain direct access to distant markets enor- mously expanded the Culhua-Mexica's range and scope of trading activities. Brasseur de Bourbourg studied ancd plotted the network of highways utilized by mer- chalnts which later were to be used by Mexican soldiers to protect the merchants and to conquer additional tributary provinces (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: pp. 242-243, 622-623). In so far as trade expeditions to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and to Tehuantepec itself are concerned, we learnl that the merchants and their caravans, on leaving the Valley of Mexico, first set out for Tehuacan, probably by way of Cuernavaca and Iz6icar M\latamoros, whence they would follow the Papaloapain River to Tuxtepec. From Tuxtepec, which became the most important trading center of the Culhua- Mexica empire, one road continued to Anahuac Xica- lanco (Mexico Gulf coast lands) and another to Ana- huac Ayotl'an (Pacific coast lands about Tehuantepec) (Dibble and Anderson, 1959: p. 17, and fn. 2; Soustelle, 1955: p. 89). According to Brasseur de Bourbourg, the road from Tuxtepec to Anahuac Ayotlkan went through Chuapa to Tehuantepec, where the road divided into two; one continued east along the foothills of the Sierra to Soconusco, the second, west to Tututepec and Ayutla (then Ayotlan), along the littoral of the Pacific in the coastal Mixteca (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: pp. 242-243, 622-623; fig. 2). It is the town of Ayutla which gives its name to the coastal strip extend- ing from Tututepec to Tonala which the Mexicans called Anahuac Ayotlan (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: p. 242, fn. 1). Before we proceed, we should say that we did not always succeed in unraveling the skein of historical events which occurred during the period A.D. 1440- 1519 (M\loctezuma I to Moctezuma II), and in placing each event in its true chronological niche. Students of Mexican codices, legends, and chronicles have not al- ways been able to avoid anachronisms completely. His- torical sources may erroneously credit Axayacatl for a feat done by Ahuitzotl. We can only endeavor to give an acceptable sequence of events. Along with the merchants came the soldiers to pro- tect and avenge the death of the former, or to conquer more provinces. It was Axayacatl (1469-1481) who conceived the idea of subjecting Tehuantepec to Mexi- can rule. He crossed the mountains of the Isthmus (we may infer that he followed the traditional beaten track of the merchants which led from Tuxtepec to Tehuantepec), defeated combined Huave and Chontal forces who tried to stop him, plundered Tehuantepec and destroyed its temples, and then took Umalalang, the Huaves' fortified harbor on the lagoons. Axayacatl then quickly led his troops to Soconusco, conquered it, and retraced his steps to Tehuantepec, where he rein- forced the Mexican garrison billeted there. He annexed Huatulco, west of Tehuantepec, and returned to Tenoch- titlan with thousands of captives who were later im- molated in the ceremonies celebrating his accession to the throne (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: pp. 282- 287). Three years later he swooped down on the Isthmus for the second time, and in a military campaign which lasted only a few weeks, he ransacked the prov- inces of Sonconusco and Xuchitepeque (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: p. 301). Chroniclers do not mention whether or not Tehuantepec was spared. Burgoa's account of the Tehuantepec conquest dif- fers, offering a more humanitarian version of the conduct of the Mexican soldiers and their leaders. However, he sometimes uses the name "Moteuczoma" in a generic sense, applying it indiscriminately to desig- lnate both Axayacatl and Moctezuma, and thereby con- fusing the issue somewhat. Burgoa claims that Mocte- zuma (read Axayacatl) chose Tehuantepec, with its amenable climate, as the resort where soldiers who were exhausted from fighting in Soconusco and Guatemala could repair to relax and recuperate. He forbade his soldiers to loot the territory, but rather, ordered them to protect it, while the land remained in the possession of the Huaves and under their cultivation (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 340). The Huaves and the M\lixes, who inhabited the Pacific Plains ill the time of Axayacatl, were aware of the futility of resistance and granted the Mexicans the right of transit through their land (Bur- goa, 1674: 2: p. 398). The Huaves occupied the coastal part of the Pacific Plains from Tehuantepec to TonalA, which they had previously occupied from Jalapa to Tonala, and the Mixes-Zoques occupied the northern part (Burgoa, 1674: 2: pp. 328, 338-339). According to Huave legends, their ancestors originally came from Peru, where they had been driven out by wars. Embarking in canoes (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 339), boats or rafts (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 398), or on boats propelled by sails or oars (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1858: 3: p. 36), they headed northward along the coast until they ar- rived off Tehuantepec. They landed first at Wachilaif, then built a stronghold at San Francisco del Mar, and finally they settled permanently on the island of Arri- anguiambaj (Old Town) (fig. 1). Gradually they began to drive the Mixes, who occupied the whole of the Isthmus from the Atlantic to the Pacific, out of the Pacific Plains (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1861b: p. 266). After offering some resistance (Brasseur de Bourbourg,</page><page sequence="14">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 196 7] HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 15 1861b: p. 266), or little resistance (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 339), the Mixes and the Huaves came to an agree- ment (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 398); the Mixes abandoned the plains and betook themselves to the mountains. Burgoa draws our attention to another more plausi- ble origin. On the strength of possible linguistic rela- tionships between Huave and an as yet unidentified Nicaraguan language, it had been conjectured that Nicaragua was the Huaves' ancestral homeland (Bur- goa, 1674: 2: p. 339). Once settled, the Huaves ventured on trading expedi- tions along the Pacific coast (Brasseur de Bourbourg, 1861b: p. 266). Brasseur de Bourbourg's statement and the legends describing the Huaves as navigators are all to their credit. Moro, who spent several months among them during the nineteenth century, noted that they were ignorant of the use of oars, possessed no seagoing vessels, and did not know how to swim (Moro, 1844: p. 92); sailing craft were unknown up to the turn of the century (Gadow, 1908: p. 165). The Huaves did not use tortoise shell, coral, or pearls, and neither did the Zapotec (Moro, 1844: p. 110). Since the time of Moro's observations, they have learned to use sails and oars. Did their ignorance of navigational lore alnd disinterest in sea products mean that their link with the sea was only casual or accidental, or did it mean that since the time they arrived at Wachilaif they gradually forgot these arts and crafts? The mention of the presence of sailing rafts off the coast of Tehuantepec in Huave legends comes as no surprise. We know now that such rafts set sail on long voyages along the Pacific coast of northern South America and Central America (Edwards, 1960: pp. 374 ff ) and were able to make the shore even through a high surf (ibid., 1960: p. 372). Although the surf off the coast of Tehuantepec runs very high at times, it would have presented no landing problem. Even if historical records and linguistic data reveal many ambi- guities in Huave legends, some of their content is worth keeping in mind; for example, the existence of a type of seagoing craft hints of probable contacts in the pre- historic past between the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Central American regions. The language spoken by the Huaves is an isolate and is apparently only remotely related to Zapotec and to Misquito-Toncagua (Fern'andez, Swadesh, and Weit- laner, 1960: pp. 147-148; Swadesh, 1959: p. 18). It seems that its closest tie is with the Mixe-Zoque linguis- tic group (Radin, 1916). The Chontal of Oaxaca, of whom little is known ethnologically, live to the west of the Huaves. They now occupy a strip of land extending from the coast up into the mountainous area; in the past they may have been entirely confined to the highlands. From Nejapa to Tequisistlan the Chontals had a common land bound- ary with the Mixes. Nejapa, which was originally Mixe territory, later fell a prey to the Zapotec (Burgoa, 1674: 2: pp. 234-235). Tequisistlan has remained Chontal up to the present. As we have already men- tioned, the Mixe-Zoques occupied the northern part of the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec at the time of Axayacatl's conquest (Burgoa, 1674: 2: p. 338). The total area originally occupied by the Mixe- Zoques included a strip of land which extended from Villa Alta to Tapachula and beyond, along the Pacific seaboard. It appears that they occupied the northern part of the Pacific Plains up to the last century (Be- rendt, 1873: p. 147). There are no clear-cut divisions in the Mixe-Zoque linguistic group, which consists of a series of related dialects with a maximum divergence of 3.5 centuries (Fern'andez, Swadesh, and Weitlaner, 1960: pp. 144-145). The linguistic time depth and the number of dialects would favor the theory that Mixe- Zoque populations moved along the foothills of the Sierra down to Tapachula in the not too distant past. However, it is impossible to decide whether the Mixe- Zoques settled into the area prior to the Huaves. We now resume the historical account of the events on the Pacific Plains. After Axayacatl's second mili- tary raid, Zaachila III (1465-1487?), who was king of the Zapotec and was at that time probably residing in Teozapotl'an, became envious of Axayacatl's easy victories, and fearful for the security of his people, now threatened by the Mexicans in Tehuantepec. He at- tacked, defeated, and dispossessed them of their Te- huantepec and Soconusco conquests. He expelled the Huaves, who took to the lagoons, where they have been confined ever since. It would be interesting to know the road taken by Zaachila III, whether he crossed the tangle of the Oaxaca mountains or whether he chose the circuitous road which led from the Valley of Oaxaca to Huatulco, and thence to Tehuantepec along the Pacific coast. Since their expulsion the Huaves have lived virtually isolated from the surrounding popula- tions, thus preserving many of their traditions intact. Up to the turn of the century, they continued to worship their clay idols, tatooed or marked the women with a pair of small scars beneath the cheekbones, and beat the teponaztles for summoning men to official meetings (Gadow, 1908: pp. 170, 189). During the reign of Ahuitzotl (1486-1502), the people of Tehuantepec, allied with other towns, twice tried to prevent Mexican merchants from trading in the south-isthmic area. The first time, the merchants were encircled in Quauhtenango, a town in the province of Anahuac Ayotlan. For four years, forces from Tehuan- tepec, Juchitan, Ixhuatlan, Huazontl'an, etc., held the merchants at bay. Despite their numerical inferiority, the merchants defeated their besiegers, took many cap- tives, and conquered the region (Dibble and Anderson, 1959: pp. 3 and 6). The second time, some merchants were killed. Irritated by the continuous presence of large numbers of merchants, and objecting to the out- flow of precious goods obtained from the gullible Zapo- tec for "tit-bits and cheap commodities," several Zapotec towns killed the intruders. Ahuitzotl led a</page><page sequence="15">16 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. punitive expedition to the Isthmus against the Zapotec towns which dared to slaughter the merchants. The Zapotec and Mexican armies met near Tehuantepec. The battle was undecided for a long time. Finally, the Mexicans were victorious. Tehuantepec was looted and many of its people killed. The leaders of Tehuantepec agreed to pay tribute every eighty days and to recognize Ahuitzotl's suzerainty. Strangely enough, Tehuantepec does not appear on the Tribute List, and as Barlow aptly remarks, one may wonder whether Tehuantepec may not have been depicted on some pages now lost (Barlow, 1949: p. 99). Duran (1867: 1: p. 208), who apparently had access to some codex which has since disappeared, lists Tehuantepec as a tributary town. Once more, the Zapotec took up arms under the leader- ship of Cocijoeza, son of Zaachila III. Taking advan- tage of a general uprising against the Mexicans, they dislodged them from Tehuantepec for the second time. Ahuitzotl sent 60,000 soldiers against Cocijoeza with orders to bring him back alive to Tenochtitlan. Coci- joeza was informed of Ahuitzotl's scheme and withdrew with his soldiers to a stronghold he had just built at Guiengola, 16 kilometers northwest of Tehuantepec. Soon the Mexicans laid siege to it. The siege lasted seven months. The Zapotec raised havoc among the harassed Mexicans through night raids; they took many captives who were butchered, salted, and used to keep the larders filled. Three times fresh troops came from Tenochtitlan to relieve the decimated Mexicans, but to no avail. Ahuitzotl was forced to come to terms. While Mexican ambassadors were negotiating a peace settlement, Cocijoeza set forth to conquer Soconusco as his father had done (Burgoa, 1674: 2: pp. 342-343). The peace treaty stipulated that Soconusco be returned to the Culhua-Mexica empire and that soldiers and merchants be granted safe transit through Zapotec ter- ritories. Tehuantepec remained in Zapotec hands. According to the Anales de Cinauh titlan (1945: p. 58), in 1497 an epidemic decimated the population of Tehuantepec. Ahuitzotl was affronted by his defeat and plotted Cocijoeza's death several times, but his plans always failed. Thereupon he decided to deal a final blow. In 1502, under the pretense of leading troops to Soco- nusco through Oaxaca and Tehuantepec, he planned to seize Cocijoeza and Tehuantepec. But again Coci- joeza circumvented his schemes. According to Durtan (1867: 1: pp. 395-401), this military campaign was planned not only to redress grievances against the people of Xolotla and Mazatain in Soconusco, who had killed some merchants, mishandled some Tehuanos and called them cowards for having surrendered to the Mexicans, but also to collect some overdue Zapotec tributes. Ahuitzotl died a few days after his return, presumably from poison given him during his campaign in southern Mexico (Duran, 1867: 1: pp. 403-404). Moctezuma succeeded Ahuitzotl. On the day cele- brating his election to the throne, his brother-in-law Cocijoeza failed to pay homage to him, because he believed himself to be the equal of Moctezuma. As a result, Moctezuma sent 10,000 soldiers to Tehuantepec to destroy the town. Pelaxilla, Cocijoeza's wife, re- vealed the plot to her husband, who in turn ordered all 10,000 Mexicans then billeted in Tehuantepec to be killed. Cocijoeza and Pelaxilla had a son, Cocijopi, who succeeded Cocijoeza, and who ruled in Tehuantepec when Alvarado entered the town on January 12, 1522, en route to Soconusco. SITE TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATIGRAPHY THE LIEZA SITE The Lieza site (figs. 1, 3, 89) is situated across the river and 2 km. west-northwest of the town of Tehuan- tepec, just north of Dani Lieza (Cave Hill). It ex- tends northward from the foot of the hill for approxi- mately 800 meters along the right or western bank of the Tehuantepec River. It lies on what was probably at one time an old river terrace. The site is more or less rectangular, widening toward the north. It aver- ages 250 meters in width. It is generally fairly flat and was probably leveled in Postclassic times for build- ing purposes. The river, which has been cutting into its eastern side, encroaches a little more each year. Before this cutting, the site of Lieza must have ex- tended over 24 acres. The southern and southwestern parts of the site are covered with a deciduous thorn- scrub vegetation, and the remaining area is under culti- vation. The topography of the Lieza site presents no contrast with the plain stretching to the west of it and into which it merges without a change in elevation. The surface of the site now stands about 5.5 to 6 0 2 FIG. 3.

Gullies and ravines caused by torrential rains cut through the southwestern timbered part of the site; a road (fig. 90) built in 1959 bisects the western part. The banks of the road and gullies expose the cultural deposits and some of its potential cultural features, such as hearths. During the rainy seasons some of the ravines are enlarged, new ones are formed, and a few are filled. The southern portion of the site is right against the Lieza Hill, on which prehistoric people probably sought refuge during exceptionally high floods. The numerous pottery sherds strewn on the flanks of the hill attest to these brief but recurrent occupations. A feature most commonly found by the natives is urn burials. The dead were placed in large pottery jars, which were in turn interred in shallow pits. Each rainy season several of these are uncovered. Investigations in selected areas seem to confirm the fact that the base of the site, and consequently of the surrounding area, consists of a layer of gravel and small boulders, or of sand overlaid with a fairly thick, 50 to 100 cm., stratum of homogeneous, compact, sterile loam or clayey earth. These layers are all river-deposited. The clayey earth layer is virtually as hard as what is called "tepetate" in the valley of Mexico. The earliest culture-bearing layers are laid down directly on this clayey earth stratum. Surprisingly elnough, relatively few sherds can be picked up on the surface of the site. If the ravines did not cut through and disclose the cultural deposits, one would hesitate to regard Lieza as an archaeological site at all. A few lime plaster floors of very limited extent are visible occasionally on or near the surface of the site, but these cannot be correlated to any stratigraphic level. They probably belong to the Postclassic Period. Stratigraphic Pit No. Li (Figs. 4, 91, 92) A stratigraphic pit, 3 by 4 meters, and hereafter referred to as LI, was laid out near a road cut that showed cultural deposits deeper than anywhere else on the site, and near one of the exposed hearths in the western bank of this road cut. Excavation procedure involved the removal of 20-cm. thick levels to a depth of 230 cm., where sterile, homo- geneous, and compact clayey earth was encountered. Levels were numbered from top to bottom, according to the order of removal. Thus No. 1 was the topmost and No. 11 the lowermost. To simplify adequate interpretation, strata, components, and their position are discussed in sequential and chronological order, starting with the earliest recorded event.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. on the north face of the profile drawing of Strati- graphic Pit Li (fig. 4). The first recorded event (1) was the uncovering of -the river-deposited brown clayey earth which contained -a handful of sherds near its surface, which were probably washed away by a flood and redeposited. This stratum, 50 to 100 cm. thick, almost imperceptively turned yellowish toward the bottom; as we have seen previously, it rested onl a bed of gravel and small boulders. The hearth (2) (figs. 4, 92) was uncovered near the northwest corner of the excavated area. For a long time we labored under the impression that it had been intentionally dug in the clayey earth (1), but on closer examination we concluded that to build their fires, the ancient inhabitants had availed themselves of a pre- -existing shallow gully or arroyo that ran in a north- westerly direction. This gully, or hearth, which was uncovered in the pit, represents the eastern extension of the gully or hearth exposed in the bank of the road, the distance between the two being about 5 meters. The hearth built in Pit Li contained much sand and earth, small stones, and had a compact burnt earth core. Sherds were fairly numerous. The portion of the hearth exposed in the bank of the road was also excavated to retrieve all possible cultural material. The next layer (3) consisted of cultural debris which was mixed with much earth, sand, clay, stones, and rocks. Cultural remains were not abundant, but were evenly strewn throughout the stratum, which had a mean thickness of 40 cm. Its texture was fairly dense. Towards both the top and the bottom, the stratum gradually merges into the overlying and underlying layers, but with no clear-cut demarcation lines. Solid lines were traced on the profile drawing though, to indicate the transition (fig. 4). A handful of human bones, tiny fragments of long bones, were found scat- tered in this layer. This layer corresponds to the Kuak cultural phase. Layer 4, which rests directly over layer 3, marks the beginning of the Classic Period. The texture of Layer 4 is hard and more compact than that of Layer 3. It is of variable depth, 5 to 60 cm., and its content of cul- tural material is high. This stratum contained the only evidence so far recorded at Lieza of a shellfish diet. Many of the shells which belong to a mussel species, Choromnytiluts palliopunctatus, exhibit firing marks as though they had been steamed on red-hot stones. The next feature uncovered (5) (fig. 4) consisted of a lens of gravel and small boulders. It is impossible to decide whether this lens was deposited after a tor- rential rain, or by river action. This event may have taken place before or after Layer 6 was laid down. Layer 6. a thick lens which extends from south to north (fig. 4), is composed of loosely packed earth mixed with fairly abundant cultural material. The last layer was hard-packed and up to 1 meter thick. It extended over the whole excavated area and was rich in cultural material abundantly mixed with sand and clay. The very top of this layer consisted of much churned, lumpy, dried topsoil. This layer (7) contained a concentration of fired clay lumps (8) with twig and pole impressions, and is probably all that is left of a burnt down wattle-and-daub house. Instances of burnt houses have been found in every level of Pit Li in the form of fired clay lumps. Level 3 of Layer 7 in particular, contained many faunal remains representing mazama deer, Indian dogs, birds, and fish. An extended skeleton (9) of an adult lay at a depth varying between 50 and 70 cm. (fig. 4, south face of profile drawing). With its head to the east, only the legs were within the excavated area in the southwestern corner. When disinterred, the skeleton was in the last stages of decay. Only a small part of the skull, the jaw, and five small fragments of the long bones were recovered. No votive offerings accompanied the dead. The burial was undoubtedly intrusive and of a recent date. The two uppermost levels, Nos. 1 and 2, represent the Postclassic Period, or a span of time extending approximately 600 to 700 years. This Postclassic Period, which we have named the Ulam phase, un- doubtedly comprises several cultural phases packed within 40 cm. of deposits. Cultural and natural accu- mulation was so slow, that only a few centimeters of material were deposited in a century, and there are short metrical distances between cultural phases causing them to telescope into one another and the chronological sequence to be blurred. Since there are probably several cultural phases in each 20 cm. level, it was impossible to segregate the sherds into ceramic com- plexes. Cut No. L2 (Fig. 5) This cut was made into a hearth exposed in the east- ern bank of the road (fig. 90), 5 meters northwest of Stratigraphic Pit Li. At first sight the hearth was thought to be a fire pit which was intentionally dug. A closer scrutiny, however, revealed that it was the bed of a gully or arroyo partly filled with alluvial deposits, which subsequently had been used to make fires. This hearth represents the western extension of the shallow gully or arroyo or hearth found in LI, and was exposed by the cutting of an ox-cart road through the site. The bottom of this shallow gully or arroyo is slightly higher than that of the road. The evidence in favor of its being designated as an arroyo and not a pit which was intentionally dug, is the fact that it had been partly filled with several alternating sterile clay and sand layers (1 to 7) before any cultural deposit by human agency could be detected. Furthermore, since its bottom, 280 cm. below the surface of the site, is approximately 45 cm. lower than that of the hearth</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] SITE TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATIGRAPHY 19 L- 2, LIEZA HEARTH BUILT IN GULLY,EXPOSED IN EASTERN BANK OF ROAD \ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ 40 280 ?} GRAVEL AND SMALL BOULDERS ?2 CLAY OR ADOBE FLOOR ()STERILE HARD-PACKED CLAYEY ASH MIXED WVITH STONES YELLOWISH -BROWN ALLUV IUM SAME AS 2 ,REDEPOSITE LOOSE CLAYEY EARTH MIXED WITH (i) SAMEAS 2, REEPOSITEDSPARSE CULTURAL MATERIAL YELLOWISH SAND LOOSE CULTURAL LAYER (BROWN SAND ?9 HARD-PACKED CLAYEY .EARTH MIXED WITH ABUNDANT CULTURAL MATERIAL t LOOSE SANDY EARTH MIXEDoI WITH ASHES ) ASH LENSES FIG. 5.

The hearth was excavated by cutting into the sloping bank as far as possible with no danger of cave-ins. The full width of the hearth was removed, from Level 4 to Level 8 inclusive, and all the sherds and cultural material retrieved were designated by one label. The earliest culture-bearing stratum (8) consisted of a layer of ash mixed with stones and sparse cultural refuse. Two lenses of ashes (12) and Layer 8 demon- strated how the depression had been used. All the underlying strata (1 to 7) were virtually sterile, river deposited, with some few redeposited sherds. Layer 10, nearly 20 centimeters thick, was loosely packed and contained much cultural material. It was the same as Layer 6 of Stratigraphic Pit Li, whereas Layer 11 was the same as Layer 7 of Li. Cut No. L3 Convinced that early cultural material could be iden- tified in fire pits, Dr. Ekholm dug an oven-like pit exposed in the southern bank of a gully situated about 35 meters to the west of Stratigraphic Pit Li. The bank in this area is vertical and has a slight overhang. The general pattern here was for refuse to occur down to about two meters from the surface. The pit was unmistakenly in the form of an oven and was full of ashes, fine broken rocks, abundant sherds, some mazama deer and Indian dog bones, and extended downward below the sterile clayey earth. Many broken rocks found above the hearth may have been used to cover the oven. The oven, about 50 centimeters wide and 35-40 centimeters deep, unlike the two hearths previously described, seems to have been dug into the clayey soil with the intention of building an oven or a roast-pit. All culture material was bagged under one label.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. 3 kilometers north of Ventosa Bay. To the north are the Diego Hills consisting of several conically shaped hills. The Tehuantepec River flows about one kilo- meter to the east of Boca del Rio. Our Zapotec guide called our attention to the site. He recalled that years ago he had seen copper axes, a copper head about 25 cm. high, and several pots which had been found there by local inhabitants. We decided to dig at Boca del Rlo, mainly because of the Preclassic sherds found on its surface, and also because it was a likely spot for deposits of some depth. The site, formed by the debris of accumulated occu- pation and house foundations, is shaped like an elongated low hillock. It might be designated as a midden. The top of the site is more or less flat and about 500 meters long; its width varies between 50 and 150 meters. Its long axis has a north-south orientation. Its highest point is about 5 meters above the surround- ing flood plains. The site slopes down on all sides, dropping more steeply on the west side. The elevated part of the site has been built over with dwellings, for the most part of wattle-and-daub, a school house, a church, cattle pens, etc. Kitchen gardens and coconut, palm, and fruit trees fill the spaces between these structures. The site is entirely sur- rounded by a belt of dense bushes and tall trees that conceals the village even from a very short distance; a few openings in this tree and bush belt provide passage for roads. A fairly deep channel-like depression runs along the eastern side of the site. It probably represents an old silted-up segment of the Tehuantepec River, or a swamp or pond that has been filled up. In any case, this channel suggests that the site was once adjacent to or partly surrounded by bodies of brackish water (as evidenced by snail species found in our excava- tions) that were connected with the sea and on which great economic reliance for seafood could be placed. The composition of the core of the site has not been determined. Apparently it consists of sand that repre- sents the remains of a former river levee. Slow deposition of cultural debris probably consolidated the original sand core until the surface was raised and compacted enough to withstand the erosion caused by annual floods or an occasional tidal wave. Sherds are present all over the surface of the site, and over the years many burial jars have been found near the surface. Several years ago, the governor of Oaxaca, accompanied by some engineers, had a small trench cut through the side of a small mound located in the middle of the plaza to learn how it had been built. A low wall made of a single course of boulders was uncovered, but digging was carried no further. In 1960 our excavations were limited to two stratigraphic pits dug into the southwestern part of the site. Stratigraphic Pit No. Bi (Fig. 6) Stratigraphic Pit B 1 was dug in the garden of the Presidente Municipal of Boca del Rio, Mr. Candido Ambrosio, who kindly permitted us to do it. It was located on the shoulder of the site at the point where the western slope begins downward. Stratigraphic Pit B1 was laid out with its long axis oriented east-west, and was stripped in 20-cm.-thick levels. Each was numbered as it was removed, from top to bottom; No. 1 was the topmost level, and No. 19 was the lower- most. From 180 to 280 cm. layers were removed in three sections, an eastern, a central, and a western, because it was necessary to adjust our digging to architectural features encountered at this depth. Al- though our primary aim was to secure a ceramic col- umn and not to study Formative architectural remains, nevertheless we devoted the time required to obtain as much information as possible on these early structures. The features are designated as follows. For con- venience of reference, features in each period are desig- nated by the period number followed by a small letter; 2c, for instance, refers to Feature c in Period II. The stratigraphy will be discussed in sequential order, be- ginning with the lowest recorded layer. In our dis- cussion greater emphasis will be placed on natural rather than cultural stratigraphy. Once in a while, as a means of confirmation, we shall relate one to the other. Specific cultural aspects such as those that may concern ceramics or food habits will also be considered. When a cardinal direction is mentioned, such as east, it refers either to true or site east, or it may refer to a feature drawn in the east face of the profile drawing of Stratigraphic Pit Bi (fig. 6). As far as we can learn from our limited excavations, the site was built up by cultural and natural deposits in three main periods. During the first period, accre- tion was the result of recurrent occupations, probably during the dry winter and spring months, and probably also because of alluvial sedimentation. As soon as the level rose sufficiently and the surface was compacted enough, permanent settlement occurred during Period II accompanied by the establishment of a modest cere- monial center. During Period III, this portion of the site reverted to being a residential area. We shall now outline the sequence of events in chronological order, beginning with the earliest. It was not always possible to identify all events, nor can we provide a valid interpretation of all of them. PERIOD I Period I, which comprises the stratigraphic levels 15 to 19 inclusive, extends approximately between 290 and 370 cms. below the surface. It is identical to Period I of Stratigraphic Pit B2. The earliest culture-bearing strata (lb and lc) and</page><page sequence="22">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] SITE TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATIGRAPHY 23 numerous lenses of small extent recorded in Period I, are relatively thin and contain much organic matter and sand, a fair number of sherds, and numerous shells. It is more than probable that in some instances this cultural material was redeposited. This assumption is borne out by the fact that the sherds and shells are often vertically set in the soft sandy earth in which they are imbedded. The lowest stratum (lb) was laid directly on top of stratified sterile yellowish river- deposited sand (la). Generally speaking, during Pe- riod I, culture-bearing layers and lenses alternate with sterile sand layers, indicating that in several cases settle- ment was followed by flooding. This alternation be- tween settlement and flooding is further confirmed by the small snails of the Cerithidea genus, whose natural habitat is brackish water. They were found not only in small colonies on the surfaces of the sterile sand layers but also on the culture-bearing strata. They suggest either marshy or swampy conditions, or that the site may have been completely or partly submerged long enough for the snails to settle and proliferate. The snails remained on the surface when the water receded. Then the site was reoccupied, probably with the specific purpose of collecting mussels and clams. We found the remains of both in equal numbers in the cultural layers. A hearth was laid directly on the sterile yellowish sand, and was found in the northeast corner of the excavation. It consisted of a concentration of burnt earth, heavily carbonized potsherds, numerous clam and mussel shells, and a few snail and oyster shells. All the snail shells had been cracked open and the majority bore firing marks. As a conclusion, therefore, we may postulate that seasonal floods conditioned man's activity in the Pacific Plains during Period I. This corre- -sponds to the Goma cultural phase. PERIOD II This period includes levels 6 to 14 inclusive, anld extends from approximately 100 cm. to 290 cm. below the surface. This period is marked by architectural activity. Period II began with the deposition of a thick black occupational layer (2a) containing large amounts of decayed organic matter, shells, sherds, lumps of adobe, fist-size lumps of sand, ashes, fired-clay fragments with twig and pole impressions, numerous tiny flecks of carbon, and deer and turtle bones. The layer which extends over the entire excavated area contrasts sharply with the underlying Period I layers. It corresponds to the early Kuak cultural phase. Apparently the site was occupied until 30 to 40 cm. of refuse had accumu- lated. Subsequent human activity reduced its thick- ness to about 10 cm. in the central and northern part of the excavated area, leaving the original height of the surface of Layer 2a visible only in the southwestern corner. A thin hard-packed clay layer and a stratum of fired-clay lumps (2b) that occurred in this layer (2a) probably represent house floors. It seems reasonable to assume that whenever refuse piled to too great a height, or whenever new clean living quarters were needed, the prehistoric occupants of the site spread clay over some area of the site. A hearth, found in levels 14 and 15, was composed of much burnt earth mixed with a great quantity of ashes, mussel and clam shells, and some deer and turtle bones. Only a limited portion of this hearth was exposed, since most of it probably lay in the non-excavated area. We infer that the next event in the occupational sequence concerns the intentional removal of part of the occupational layer 2a to prepare the ground for an enigmatic earthwork (figs. 94, 95). At first we be- lieved that this structure would yield graves. The foundation of this earthwork cut partly through Layer 2a. The northern part or wall (2c) dividing the two basins consisted of four superimposed layers, all of which were very hard-packed. The lowest of these layers consisted of coarse yellowish sand, the second of fine yellowish sand, the central section of puddled chocolate-colored, fine-grained clayey earth, and the top layer of extremely hard and compacted gravel. The entire southern part (2d) consisted of hard-packed gravel. Its foundation was some 6 cm. higher than that of the northern part (2c). Where the two walls met, the junction was flat and perfectly vertical (fig. 7). The two basins thus uncovered contained only clayey earth mixed with some sand and organic matter, but neither burials nor a cache as we had expected. The basins averaged 50 cm. in width, and were not quite 30 cm. deep. This earthwork was very carefully built, with clean edges. The outline of the walls and basins was revealed, because the differential rate of evapora- tion caused the walls (2c and 2d) to dry more rapidly N W E [ SAND [ GRAV EL FIG. 7. Earthwork of Pit B1, Boca del Ri'o, showinig tlle junction between the two types of building material used.</page><page sequence="23">24 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. than the filled areas of the basins. Several small boulders were arranged in a semi-circle around the eastern end of the southern basin (figs. 94, 95). Nonc showed marks of firing, so that our assumption that we might be dealing with a fireplace proved to be incorrect. The arrangement of the small boulders seems to have been somewhat disturbed prior to their being covered up. A post hole and what at first appeared to be de- signs carved in the yellowish earth surrounding the basins and filled with brown earth, were uncovered just south of the basins. Although these two-tone designs looked somewhat like "sand-painting," we now feel that they have resulted from filled mouse burrows. It is unfortunate that the excavation exposed too limited an area of this earthwork, and consequently failed to pro- vide enough latitude to discuss its layout, extent, and purpose. The discovery was all the more intriguing because it was unexpected. As far as we can follow the sequence, soon after the completion of the earthwork, and before it could be put to its intended use, it was covered with a yellowish layer of mixed clay and sand (2e), either through human agency or river action. Later, this clay and sand layer consolidated into a hard, homogeneous mass. The next architectural phase involved the erection of a low wall of extremely solidly compacted gravel (2f) on the eastern part of the excavated area. The wall runs somewhat off true north (fig. 96) and aver- ages 60-70 cm. in height and 35 cm. in width. It seems to have been built over a pre-existing low sand wall. Along its eastern side (northern part of the excavation) the wall was buttressed with more gravel. East of the wall, the area toward the center of the site is filled with hard yellowish clayey earth (2g) which contains some culture-bearing lenses. We con- cluded that this was the retaining wall for a ceremonial platform only after all three walls which we encountered in our excavations of Pit Bi were studied. The eastern wall (2f) was dismantled in order to search for cultural and technical clues to its chronological or cultural posi- tion and to the technique used by its builders, as well as how the hardness had been achieved. The wall contained a handful of sherds representing several types which were assigned to the Kuak cultural phase, clam, oyster, mussel, and Cerithidea shells, and numerous various-sized lumps of hardened clay which would indi- cate that the gravel was mixed with clay. Thus clay is the basic material which gives these walls their rigidity. Once dried, these walls achieved a remarkable hardness. The construction of this low retaining wall and the filling of the enclosed area with clayey earth may repre- sent the earliest attempt ever made to establish a cere- monial center in the Pacific Plains. The situation of Boca del Rio, surrounded or partly surrounded by marshes, ponds, and lakes and remote from areas of intensive population settlement, is strongly reminiscent of La Venta. West of wall 2f were two superimposed, thick, fired clay floors (2h) alternating with layers rich in decayed organic matter, such as deer bones and lobster shell fragments, but low in cultural remains. The numerous Cerithidea shells found in these layers were scattered, and not in colonies as was the situation in Period I; they may nonetheless represent a flood. The upper clay floor which extended the full length of the exca- vated area from south to north, may have surrounded either part or the whole of the ceremonial platform. A similar situation was recorded in Stratigraphic Pit B2. It is difficult to place the next event in correct chronological sequence. Apparently the platform had been desecrated for some time before and had been used as a residential area. Such an occupation is attested to by fired clay floors and occupational layers (2j). A second wall (2i) was then erected, also in a geln- erally north-south direction, about 120 cm. west of Wall 2f (fig. 6, north and south faces, and fig. 96), and cut through Layer 2h. Could this second wall mean that the ceremonial platform was enlarged by raising its level and by constructing a new wall around the first one? Wall 2i, like Wall 2f, is built of ex- tremely hard gravel mixed with clay. It seems quite probable that clay was added to the circumvallated area not only to raise the platform to the desired height, but also to cover occupational layers (2j). This wall con- tained a few clam and mussel shells. It seems quite possible that the ceremonial platform was desecrated a second time, and that again some people settled and lived on it. Their refuse, which forms Layer 2k, extends over the whole excavated area and contains much cultural material and layers of fired clay lumps. The post hole in the south face of the profile of the drawing (fig. 6) also indicates habita- tional activities. This layer (2k) initiated a new cul- tural phase characterized by pottery of the Atempani Scraped type and by Anadara esmeralda and Anadara grandis clam shells. The deposition of gravel (21) must have occurred some time during this phase, after which more cultural refuse and fired clay floors like (2m) may have accumulated until the platform was covered. The last event recorded in Period II was the erection of platform wall No. 3 (2n), probably with a view to restoring this portion of the site to its former function. Like the two preceding walls, Wall 2n had a north- south orientation and consisted of hard-packed gravel mixed with clay. Its course could be only partly traced because its central portion had been destroyed by a burial dug in the Classic Period. The area east of the retaining wall was then filled with clayey earth (2o) to form the surface of the platform. It is the occurrence of these three walls oriented in a north-south line, constructed in close proximity at three different time periods, and made of the same material, that prompted us to regard them as retaining</page><page sequence="24">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 SITE TOPOGRAPHY AND STRATIGRAPHY 25 walls for ceremonial platforms. The occurrence of similar architectural features in Stratigraphic Pit B2, especially the fired clay walks along the walls, served to support our conclusions. The upper layers of Period II (Layers 8 and 9) were somewhat disturbed by five intrusive burials be- longing to the Classic Period. Layer 2p, which consisted of brown earth and con- tained little cultural material, seems to have been de- posited some time after the erection of Wall 2n. PERIOD III The period includes levels 1 to 5 and extends from the surface down to a depth of 100 centimeters. Period III is related to the Classic Period. It begins with the laying down of Layer 3a, which seems to be associated with the Xuku cultural phase. It extends over the entire excavated area. Its thickness varies greatly and its surface shows evidence of having been exposed, and therefore subject to erosion and disturb- ance. Unlike Early Classic strata at the Lieza site, those of Boca del Rio contained numerous shells, attest- ing to the fact that its Classic population, which was probably descended from Formative people, still relied heavily on the sea and lagoons for their food. The people of the Classic Period buried their dead in the refuse in small pits, because the soil was too hard to dig large or deep pits. Because the burial pits were so small, the disturbance caused by them was much less than expected. Five burials related to the Classic stage penetrated the Late Formative layers. Burials Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were found between 140 and 160 cm. below the surface, and Burials 4 and 5 (fig. 97), between 160 and 180 cm. below the surface. The latter burials pertain to the Early Classic; they were better preserved and were furnished with grave goods. Burial 5 (fig. 98), in all probability a fractional or secondary adult inhumation, was found near the center of the excavated area. It appeared as a tangle of bones, most of which had disintegrated. The skull and the mandible lay on their left sides in the midst of the long bones. The burial was accompanied by a large Tehuan- tepec Black-and-White type plate which lay in several large fragments half-tucked under the bones. It was nearly complete, and it had been broken prior to burial in the grave (fig. 66a). Burial 4 (fig. 99), in the northwest corner of the excavated area, was found under Burial 2; it was the best preserved and the most complete. The skeleton, also of an adult, was crushed flat and had been dis- articulated before being placed on its back in the pit. The mandible lay near the pelvis. Arms and legs were folded over the trunk. Pinkish red earth, probably containing some hematite, had been spread near the head. Two round bowls of the Huilotepec Decorated type were found at the eastern end of the body (fig. 66b, c). Two fragments of a grinding stone made from a flat boulder were found to the south of the skeleton, but their association with the burial cannot be proven. Later, three more burials were made, somewhat higher than Burials 4 and 5. None was accompanied by votive offerings, and all three were badly decayed. Burial 3, found near the southwestern corner of the excavated area, was the most poorly preserved of all. It consisted of several long bones bunched together vertically in a very small pit. Inhumation was probably fractional and secondary. The bones of Burial 2, a fractional and secondary burial, were bunched together and set vertically in a 40 by 44 cm. pit, like that of Burial 3. There were five fragments of long bones without condyles, part of the skull, and some fragments of ribs and other uniden- tifiable bones. There was no grave furniture. The remains of Burial 1 consisted of several frag- ments of a skull, ribs, and long bones lacking condyles. The bones lay in a tangle within a very restricted area, less than 50 cm. long. The burial was probably frac- tional and secondary; there were no grave offerings. The only urn burial found was recorded at a depth of 120 to 140 cm. below the surface in the southwestern corner; only a fraction lay within the excavated area. The red-slipped storage jar (fig. 35a) of the Zuleta Red-Slipped type contained a handful of fragmentary infant bones. Storage jars also found their way into the refuse in Classic times. Three were buried at depths varying between 120 and 160 cm. below the surface. The mouth of one jar was level with the surface of the dwelling area (120 cm.) and apparently a plate had been reversed over its opening. All the jars and the plate were badly broken and incomplete. Layer 3a was rich in cultural material, especially sherds. After this layer had been laid down, part of it was removed to build a stone wall (3c) of which only three stones were left in line near the northeast corner (fig. 100). The remaining area was filled with clayey earth (3b). The original length or height of this wall cannot be determined. It has a general north-south direction, and it was probably the retaining wall of a house floor. This house floor was overlaid with spo- radic deposits of cultural refuse (3d). The next event concerns the deposition of a fairly thick grayish-brown layer (3e) which contained much cultural remains mixed with sand and lenses of clay. It extended over the entire excavated area. Its surface was uneven as though it had been eroded. Numerous fired clay lumps and restricted fired clay floors lay directly on top of it. Layer 3e was capped with a deposit (3g) of churned up topsoil consisting of stones and fine sandy earth which had become hard and lumpy. Except for a few modern glazed sherds, it contained almost no sherds or cultural material. Two additional one-coursed stone walls were en-</page><page sequence="25">26 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. countered. One (3f) cut through Level 3e, but it can- not be assigned to any cultural phase. The uppermost stone wall was modern. Stratigraphic Pit No. B2 (Figs. 8, 101, 102) Stratigraphic Pit B2, 2.5 by 2.5 meters, was dug near the apex of the Boca del Rio site, about 60 meters north-northwest of Pit B 1. This place was selected because the shaft of an unfinished well, dug in 1959, revealed deep cultural deposits. The excavation pro- cedure involved the removal of 20-centimeter-thick levels, numbered from top to bottom. The chronologi- cal sequence of Pit B2 reflects that of Pit B 1, but without its complications. We identified three periods during which the site was built up. These periods equate with those of Pit B 1. PERIOD I Period I includes levels 13 to 17 which extend from 240 to 340 cm. below the surface. The earliest recorded event in the sequence was the deposition of thin brown-colored layers and lenses (lb and lc) containing much sand, numerous tiny specks of carbon, and some redeposited cultural material; the same situation was found in Pit B 1. These culture- bearing layers were capped with yellowish, laminated, sterile river-deposited sand. The small snails belonging to the Cerithidea genus, found in small colonies on the surface of these sterile sand layers indicate that the site had been periodically under water. Three features have been recorded for Period I, a fireplace, a semicircle of stones, and an intrusive burial. The latter feature will be discussed below. The fireplace was found in the northeast corner of the excavated area, at a depth varying from 325 to 340 cm. below the surface. It was built of small boulders and rocks arranged in a circle (fig. 103) one meter in diameter, and placed directly on the sterile sand. The extremely hard-packed sand between and around the stones was stained with numerous tiny carbon specks, but contained neither cultural material, bones, nor shells. Prior to its being covered by sterile sand, the fireplace had been partly disturbed. After the fireplace had been covered by river-depos- ited sterile sand and some thin culture-bearing layers and lenses, a semicircle of stones was built (fig. 104). It was 70 cm. wide and 20 cm. high, and extended from 275 to 295 cm. below the surface in Levels 14 and 15. Half of the stones were small boulders and half were fragments of rock. Nearly all were coated with thick lime concretions. The stones on the outer margin were arranged in an almost perfect semicircle; the bottom stones were small, those piled on top of them, much larger. Only a few bottom stones showed signs of fire action. Neither burnt earth nor carbon was noticed. We assume that these stones were placed around the base of a pillar or post to hold it erect. Then again, a flood deposited its alluvial sand over the site and obliterated all signs of human activity. Layer lc, the topmost culture-bearing layer of Period I, was mixed with much ash. During Period I Boca del Rio seems to have been intermittently occupied by people who camped at the site during the dry season to gather shellfislh and to fish. PERIOD II Events of Period II occurred between 120 and 240 cm. below the surface and comprise Levels 7 to 12 inclusive. If our interpretation is correct, Period II begins with the building of a hearth (2a) which pene- trated into Period I strata down to a depth of 330 cm. below the surface. Only part of the hearth lay within the excavated area in the southwestern corner. It con- sisted of hard-packed burnt earth mixed with stones, decayed organic matter, and clay. Its core was a hard- packed lens of clam, mussel, oyster, and snail shells. The snail shells had all been cracked open. The mussel shells were partly charred and were probably steamed on an open fire made of red hot stones. This earth was overlaid with a thin stratum of hard-packed clayey earth. Subsequently, a fairly thick occupational layer (2b) was laid down. Up to 50 cm. thick, it contained much organic matter, many sherds, and mussel, clam, and oyster shells. We assume that originally it extended over the entire excavated area, and that part was then removed and replaced by clayey earth (2c. The post mold in Layer 2b (fig. 8, west face) indicates some construction. The next event of which we have a record is marked by the presence of superimposed fired-clay floors (2d). One such floor extended the full length of the excavated area from north to south. Fire-clay floors are usually associated with house building. However, in view of the narrowness of the floors exposed, such an inference may be doubtful in this case. They are similar to those found in Pit B 1. Their average width is 130 centi- meters. Fire-clay floors have also been observed in a well dug approximately 15 meters south of Pit B2. We may therefore infer that they extended over a fair portion of the site. One explanation may be that these are not house floors but mark the surfacing walks built around or in front of ceremonial platforms. They have the same north-south orientation as those of Pit B1. Cultural refuse (2e) accumulated for some time after the clay floors had been built; later it was partly re- moved to build a gravel wall. Levels 10 and 11, in which the fired clay floors were recorded, contained much cultural material. At this point we pause to return to the burial (fig. 105) intruding in the Period I layers. It is impossible to assign it to any precise cultural phase, but we believe that we must be dealing here with a Period II grave</page><page sequence="26">N O R T H E A S T BROWN TOSI HU =~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 0 0 C)~~~~0 ARYTiU s &amp; 5 ! 1~~~~~~D 'b o O 'o 0 C 0 0 0 C)~~~~~~~~~ 0 6 0 "T SRO 0 (~~~~~~~~~~~~BRW EAT 14 0 d ',,,'.','.~~~~~~~~~0 10 0~~~~~~~~~~~~ .,~~~~~~~~~C ,. ..

The grave lay on the sterile sand, 335 cm. below the surface; it was probably a secondary inhumation. The remains, partly decayed and very friable, consisted of a fragment of pelvis, some vertebrae, fragments of ribs and long bones without condyles, and part of a skull. There were no votive offerings. Next in the sequence of events was the building of a wall (2f) in a north-south direction, recorded in the easternmost part of the excavated area. As indicated above, it involved the removal of some previously de- posited strata and part of the fired-clay floors. Like those encountered in Pit B 1, this wall was built of gravel mixed with clay. Its face, exposed during the excavation, sloped backward. It is estimated to have been one meter high and 60 cm. thick. To the west of the wall, more compacted gravel was spread, but it is impossible to decide whether it was laid down after the wall was constructed, or whether it was a part of the wall. The last event recorded in Period II concerns the deposition of a thin shell layer overlaid by a thin layer of fine sand (2g). These two layers were found only in the southwestern corner of the excavation. PERIOD III Period III includes Levels 1 to 6, which occur from the surface down to a depth of 120 centimeters. No Xuku deposits have been identified in B2. The next event in the sequence heralds a new cul- tural phase, Tixum, and refers to the deposition of Layer 3a directly over the gravel Layer 2f. Layer 3a contained abundant sherds, relatively numerous shells, and much organic matter. Its average thickness was 20 centimeters. This layer extended over the entire excavated area and was overlaid with hard-packed clayey earth (3b) mixed with much sand and little cultural material. Its depth varied between 25 and 45 centimeters. Its origin cannot be determined. It may represent alluvium deposited by an exceptionally high flood or may have been brought in by the prehistoric inhabitants of this period. The richest and thickest culture-bearing stratum (3c) varied in thickness between 40 and 100 centimeters. It consisted of brownish earth, somewhat lumpy, much clay, abundant sherds, and a few shells. Shells found in this stratum suggest that people now living in Classic times still derived part of their diet from the sea and lagoons. The topmost stratum consisted of churned-up, lumpy earth containing many stones and virtually no cultural material beyond a few modern glazed sherds. THE POTTERY The ceramic collection obtained in our excavations has been analyzed, the data synthesized, and the types described according to the Type-Variety taxonomic scheme propounded by Gifford (1960), Phillips and Gifford (1959), and Smith, Willey, and Gifford (1960). The Type-Variety scheme was originally conceived to be applied to the classification of the ceramics of the Maya area. There are, however, no restrictions im- posed on its use for classifying and describing ceramic inventories from regions outside the Maya area. In- deed, we believe it to be imperative that investigators of various regions of Mesoamerica apply the same ana- lytical and conceptual criteria in setting up their pottery types. Such a procedure would greatly facilitate cross- cultural comparisons throughout Mesoamerica. It would also furnish a basis on which pottery types of the areas studied could be integrated into larger and higher units of synthesis, such as ceramic horizons or style of designs. Before we proceed with the description of the types and varieties, we wish to make explicit our position on taxonomic classification. There are two main aspects to the problem of typology. The first, the conceptual one, refers primarily to the validity and actuality of the types established by the analyst. Although we are aware that the use of any typological classification is justified if it serves the purpose for which it is intended -that is, to trace cultural evolution through time and across space-and that "pottery types . . . are not like bonbons in a box, each neatly separated from its fellow by a wrapping of foil" (Ford, 1962: p. 14), we nevertheless believe that types should, whenever possible, approximate real cultural phenomena and not be mere abstractions set up by the analyst. From a cultural point of view, a type is a cultural complex which reflects a pattern of behavioral regularities. The second aspect deals with the technique we followed from the pile of sherds to the tabulated and charted data. The latter aspect will now be briefly discussed to ex- plain how we arrived at the classification of types and varieties. We relied heavily on Smith, Willey, and Gifford's (1960) paper in the following description, and we can at best only paraphrase what they have to say about it. Analysis: In sorting the sherds, we first aimed at establishing basic working units. These units had no other cultural or chronological implications than the representation of clusters of recognizable and diagnos- tic attributes, distinguishable from one another. We based our ceramic units on six sorting criteria which are, in decreasing order of sensitivity to cultural change: decorative style and elements, shapes, decora- tive techniques, thickness, surface finish, and paste. Each of these features evolves at a different rate. Those features which are least limited by the technical requirements of the function reveal themselves as more sensitive in registering changes, and consequently evolve at a faster pace. Synthesis: This step consisted of reducing the num- ber of basic working units (or clusters of attributes) by eliminating all those which proved to be artificial</page><page sequence="28">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 THE POTTERY 29 constructions, on the basis of sherd count and prelimi- nary tabulations. The remaining units were then grouped into culturally significant types and varieties. This was achieved by determining the boundaries of the types in space and in time and by determining the number of varieties to be included in each type. This task is similar to that of the linguist who groups allo- phones into phonemes. "A type represents an aggre- gate of visually distinct ceramic attributes already ob- jectified within one or several varieties, that when taken as a whole, are indicative of a particular class of pottery produced during a specific time interval within a spe- cific region" (Smith, Willey, and Gifford, 1960: p. 333). The single or several varieties which compose a type reflect minor ceramic variations which resulted from changes in the behavior of one potter or a small group of them. Under Miscellaneous, we grouped small lots of sherds with no definite typological status. The number of sherds within each group varies between one and sev- eral dozen, the average being just over half a dozen. Their time range is usually very restricted; some appear in one phase only. The types and varieties set up for the Pacific Plains of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec will remain potential units until further studies of ceramic collections from other sites confirm or invalidate the taxonomic status of the Lieza and the Boca del Rio types and varieties. Nomenclature: The binomial scheme of type naming as suggested by Smith, Willey, and Gifford (1960: pp. 334-336) was adopted here. Modes: Modes were set up at the same time as the types and varieties. They are discussed below (p. 144). Stratigraphic ceramic column: The ceramic material from each pit and cut was studied separately. Then, with a view to tracing a tentative ceramic chronology, the levels of all five pits and cuts were seriated; the result is graphically summarized by the bar-chart in figure 9. Setting up a sequence of cultural phases: The cultural phases were identified primarily on the basis of the ceramic analysis. The ceramic column furnished the framework for the cultural sequence, but other fac- tors, such as architectural, figurine, and lithic com- plexes, and shifts in food habits, were also instrumental in defining these phases. The cultural phases are also closely related to the consecutive stages of cultural "sedimentation" which we discussed in the previous section. The cultural phases we identified are: Postclassic: Ulam Classic: Tixum (early and late sub-phases) Xuku Protoclassic: Niti Late Formative: Kuak Goma Finally, we wish to emphasize that the sherds recov- ered in our excavations were exceptionally fragmentary. Their small size often hampered identification and rendered assignment to types or varieties difficult. It is unfortunate that these sherds were "forced" into one or the other type or variety. The use of ceramic groups, which would have easily solved this problem, was brought to our attention by Robert E. Smith after the analysis, synthesis, and discarding of plain and body sherds were completed. The ceramic group is a valuable classificatory device, since it not only prevents the analyst from forcing sherds into a type or variety, but allows him to dispose of them in a manner that will not distort his statistical figures (Robert E. Smith, personal communication). "A ceramic group is a con- figuration of closely related pottery types that demon- strate a distinctive homogeneity in range of variation concerning form, base color, technological, and other allied attributes" (Gifford, 1963: p. 23). We shall now turn to the description of types and varieties, more or less according to their chronological appearance. As a preliminary step, certain terms used in our shape terminology should be defined. Since we are dealing almost entirely with sherds, and only ex- ceptionally with complete vessels, our assignment of rim sherds to specific vessels is often conjectural. The basic shapes are defined as follows: Bowl, a vessel with rounded walls, the height of which is less than half of its exterior rim diameter, with or without a distinctive base. Dish, a vessel with straight flaring, outcurving, or recurved walls, the height of which varies between one- third and one-fifth of its exterior rim diameter, and usually with a flat base, though the base at times may be slightly concave or convex. Plate, a vessel with straight flaring, outcurving, or recurved walls, the height of which is less than one- fifth of its exterior rim diameter, and with a flat to slightly convex or concave base. Basin, an exceptionally large bowl or dish, usually with a flat or occasionally convex base. Composite or S-Z angle bowl, a vessel with an angle separating the rim and the lower part which is usually rounded. Tecomate, a vessel or small jar with rounded walls and incurving rims and a rounded or flat base. Apaxtle, a type of basin commonly found in Mexico during the Classic and Postclassic periods, which usu- ally has straight flaring walls and a flat base. Continuous curve jar, a storage vessel with a con- stricted orifice, the wall, neck, and rim forming an uninterrupted curve. In the illustrations the vessels are shown with the right half in section; the interior decoration is presented on the left-hand side of the rim section; the exterior decoration is presented on the right-hand side of the rim section. Sizes are indicated by the centimeter scale. Dotted lines on the top and sides of lips or rims indi- cate painted zones.</page><page sequence="29">30 WALLRATII: EXCAVATIONS IN TEIIUANTEPEC [TRANS.

Common terms start with a lower-case letter. THE GOMA PHASE The ceramic complex of the Goma phase seems to reflect the terminal phase of a cultural stage that had begun some time earlier and had already exceeded its peak of technological excellence. It seems likely that the Goma phase initiated a period of slow and steady decay in ceramic technique such as would characterize weakening and less influential exterior cultural stimuli. The deterioration process in pottery craftsmanship, which primarily affects the quality of pastes and surface finishes, becomes especially apparent in the Kuak phase, extends to the Niti phase, and terminates with the advent of the Classic Period. Radani Gray, which seems to have developed along different evolutionary lines, is immune to this process. The pottery of the Goma phase is still in full vigor, and on the whole, displays competent craftsmanship. Pottery types are numerous, but several of them have become extinct in the succeeding phase. Pots are well fired and fairly hard. Clays and aplastics used to manufacture the pots were obtained at the site and usually contain quartz and mica in variable amounts. The deliberate control of firing, with a view to the achievement of specific surface colors or contrasting color effects, was limited to Guizi Black-and-White, Untempered Black-and-White, and possibly Radani Gray. In all other vessels where firing was poorly controlled, firing clouds mar their surfaces. Slipped and polished vessels are more common than unslipped ones. Vessels of the Ventosa Russet type probably have a double slip. Except for Xiwi Red- Slipped vessels, the exterior of vessel bottoms is en- tirely slipped. Most polished surfaces are characterized by marks of polishing tools. Classic sherds are readily distinguishable by the absence of such tool marks. Pixixi Daub, represented by a single nearly complete ovate bowvl decorated with incised and painted elements, is found exclusively during the Goma phase. A series of miscellaneous ceramic units with indeterminate typo- logical status is also restricted to this phase. Each of these units is represented by a handful of sherds. Also characteristic of the Goma phase are Diego Flanged: Diego Variety and Lieza Self-Slipped: Pilas Variety. The dominant ceramic units of this phase are Ex- quipulas Burnished: Exquipulas Variety, a plain house- hold ware; Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety, a deco- rated ware; and Xiwi Red-Slipped: Xiwi Variety. Numerically less important are Radani Gray, mass produced and of excellent quality; Guizi Black-and- White: Guizi Variety, with its decoration achieved through firing alone; Tilema Dichrome: Tilema Va- riety, with two different slips on the same vessel; and Ventosa Russet: Ventosa Variety, which is double- slipped. A number of shapes are almost exclusively confined to the Goma phase: basins or dishes with walls widen- ing toward thickened and often grooved lips; plates, and possibly dishes, with recurved walls and lateral ridges; jars with insloping walls and direct rims; ovate bowls (one example) ; and vessels with bulging bases. Also distinctive of this phase and found sporadically in the following Kuak and Niti phases are the following shapes: composite or S-Z angle bowls with short out- curving rims forming a well-defined angle with the body walls, continuous curve jars (which virtually disappear during the Kuak phase and re-emerge in the Niti phase), dishes and bowls with labial flanges or promi- nent ridges, tecomates with swollen or teardrop-shaped lips, jars with bulging necks, and probably spouted vessels. The thickness of the walls of open vessels often increases from base to lip. Decoration seems to be incidental. Lieza Self-Slipped and Guizi Black-and-White are the only truly deco- rated types. Among the various decorative techniques, groove incising and light incising are predominant. Notching and plain incising are less common. Slant incising, though of low incidence, is a diagnostic trait of the Goma phase. Painting is extremely rare, and usually consists of a red band applied to the lips or rims of vessels, and may occasionally involve the interior walls and bottoms of plates. The most striking feature of the whole ceramic com- plex is its limited repertory of decorative elements in which either incised or painted complex designs are absent. The designs include straight or curved parallel lines, usually arranged in simple patterns, hatched or cross-hatched triangles, notched fillets, wavy lines, and concentric arcs. Very fine, light incised concentric lines on the inside bottoms of open vessels are peculiar to the Goma phase. Some designs such as squares and rectangles composed of sets of parallel straight lines are found exclusively on Xiwi Red-Slipped: Lidgi Variety.

Techniques: groove incising (figs. lOa-r; 14b, c, k, 1); light incising (figs. 1la-e; 14g-i); slant incising (fig. 11f-i) ; fine incising (fig. 1 1j-r); punctating (figs. 13g; 14a-c); notching (figs. iOn, o; 14a); filleting (figs. iOn, o; 14a). Seventy per cent of incised sherds are groove- incised. Fine incising occurs mainly in the form of crosshatching. Light incising amounts to 10 per cent; light incised lines are shallow. Slant incising is rare; slant incised lines were produced with a tool held obliquely to the vessel wall; the resulting line, seen in cross section, has one rounded and smooth edge and one sharp edge. Filleting, which is rare, was accomplished by applying a nar- row clay fillet on the shoulders of the jars. Notch- ing occurs on fillets, ridges, and basal breaks. Ele- ments: parallel straight or curved lines; rows of notches and punctations; hatched triangles. Designs: single or parallel lines encircling the vessels (figs. lOb-d, f-i; hla, b, f, g, j, k; 14h, i, k, 1; 15k). Jars with insloping rims are often decorated with hanging crosshatched triangles (fig. 11j-n). The bodies of tecomates and jars are usually decorated with arrangements of con- centric or straight parallel lines (figs. lOd-f, 1, m, o, q, r; lla, b, d, e, h; 14b, c, 1); each line is drawn indi- vidually, and the resulting design looks as though it was achieved by means of a comb. Sets of parallel lines may join each other at an angle and form chevron- like arrangements (figs. 10k, n; 1 li); open-hatched triangles with a double line limiting one side (figs. 10a, j, n; 14k). The designs may extend to the base of the vessels (fig. lOp-r). Bowls, dishes or plates. Techniques: light incising (figs. 12a-d; 14d-j); groove incising (figs. 12e-mz; 13w-f; 14k, 1, s, t) ; plain incis- ing (figs. 12o, p, t; 15a-d, i, j); fine incising (figs. 12n; 151); groove incising combined with plain incis- ing (fig. 12q-s); notching (figs. 14m; 15j). Incising usually occurs on lips and everted rims. Elements:</page><page sequence="35">36 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

This variety is easily identifiable, al- though at times it bears similarities to Exquipulas Bur- nished: Exquipulas Variety. Lieza Self-Slipped: Pilas Variety (Fig. 16a-n) In this variety incised lines and notches were filled with a red pigment which rubs off and washes away quite readily. It was applied after firing. We assume that a goodly number of sherds now classified as Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety were originally red-filled and lost their affiliation with the Pilas Variety during the washing process. In every other respect Pilas Variety is identical to Lieza Variety. d b~~~~~ a~~~~~~~~~~~~~ m~ e g~~~~~~~~ t ~)~ \,'b h~~~~~~ ' J k n ~ ~~~~~~~r 0 5 10 cm scale FIG. 14.

Lieza Self-Slipped: Dani Variety (Fig. 16o-t) Less than a dozen sherds have been assigned to Dani Variety. In addition to incising, its decoration usually consists of a red band applied to the lip, or of painted elements on the exterior surfaces of jars, tecomates, and bowls. The sherd illustrated in figure 16s is painted in a false negative technique. Xiwi Red-Slipped: Xiwi Variety (Figs. 17as, d'; 18c-g, m, n, p-r) Paste and surface finish. See under Lieza Self- Slipped: Lieza Variety. Surface treatment: red slipped. The slip, thick and compact, covers all the surfaces except the exterior surface of the bottoms; it has a fair to high gloss sometimes almost like a glaze. Marks of the polishing tools are virtually absent. Color of slip: wide series of reds centering on Dragon's Blood Red. Firing clouds occur. Form. Shapes: though the sherds are fragmentary, they suggest the presence of numerous shapes: dishes or plates with outcurving walls and sometimes with everted rims (figs. 17a-d, g, q, d'; 18m); dishes or plates with straight flaring walls (figs. 17e, h, i, r, s; 18c-e); bowls (figs. 17m; 18g, q); tecomates (fig. 17n); plates with a lateral ridge (fig. 17j, k) ; cylindri- cal vessels (?) (fig. 18f, r) ; dishes with recurved walls (fig. 17p); composite or S-Z angle bowls (?) (fig. 17o); cylindrical vessel with recurved walls (?) (fig. 18n). Rims: usually direct; everted (figs. 17d, f, r; 18e) ; ridged rims (fig. 18f) ; thickened rims (figs. 17b, i, k, s; 18g). Lips: usually rounded; some are swollen (fig. 17n), some thickened (figs. 17i; 18r). Bases: usually flat (fig. 17a, d'). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: dishes with out- curving walls, average 27 cm., extremes 17-40 cm.; bowls, average 23.5 cm., extremes 9-30 cm.; tecomates, average based on two vessels, 20 cm.; plates with lateral ridges, average based on two vessels, 23 cm.; cylindrical vessels, average 13 cm., extremes 8-18 cm. Wall thickness: average 5.5 mm., extremes 4.5-7 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting. Design: red band applied on the top of the lip or on either side of the rim (fig. 17p-s). The red band can hardly be dis- tinguished from the red slip; therefore we are uncertain as to whether or not all the lips have been painted. Chronological position and popularity index. This variety is found from the Goma through the Xuku phase, and has its peak of popularity in the Goma and early Kuak phases (fig. 9). Temporal differences. Craftsmanship deteriorates in the late Kuak and Niti phases. Site occurrence.

Craftsmanship leaves much to be desired during the Kuak and Niti phases. Site occurrence. This variety was found principally at Boca del Rio. Ventosa Russet: Ventosa Variety (Fig. 19a-k, n, p-u) Paste and surface finish. See under Lieza Self- Slipped: Lieza Variety. Surface treatment: slipped; according to Robert Sonin, who kindly examined the sherds, it seems that a red pigment was rubbed over the wet slip prior to polishing. The whole or part of the vessel was overslipped. The presence of an over- slip is borne out by the cracks and pits filled with the red pigment. The overslip gives a lighter overtone to the dark brown primary slip. The two-color scheme was achieved by the polishing strokes, that is, the dark primary slip shows through the red overslip where the stroke pressure was applied, and as a result, the surfaces have the appearance of a russet apple. Interior surfaces are usually dull; exterior surfaces are fairly glossy; not infrequently they have a faint soapy feeling to the touch. Form. Shapes: the most probable shapes are: bowls (fig. 19a, k, q, r, t); dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 19e, u); dishes or plates with outcurving walls (fig. 19c, g, j); composite or S-Z angle bowls (fig. 19h, p); jars with insloping walls (fig. 19b, n); the rim shown in figure 19i belongs to a jar. Rims: direct, incurving, or everted. Lips: usually rounded; occa- sionally pointed (fig. 19e). Bases: flat (fig. 19j, k, q-t); bulging (fig. 19j). Dimensions.

Other shapes cannot be measured. Thickness of walls: average 6 mm., extremes 4.25-8.5 mm. Chronological position and index of popularity. Goma through Niti phases. This variety is most popular during the early Kuak phase. Temporal diff erences. During the Goma phase, vessels with open mouths prevail; during the Kuak phase, jars are as numerous as vessels with open mouths; in the Niti phase jars outnumber open vessels. Site occurrence. This variety has been found only at Boca del Rio. Discussion. The technique of overslipping or rub- bing a red pigment on the surface may be akin to rubbing a red pigment into incised lines, as is the case with vessels of the Lieza Self-Slipped: Pilas Variety. Ventosa Russet: Garza Variety (Fig. 191, m, o) Several sherds are decorated with basal notches (fig. 191, m), notched ridges (fig. 191), and groove incised lines (fig. 19m, o). The notched bases are bulging and have an average diameter of 40 cm. They may belong to large dishes or plates. Incising is post-slipping post- polishing, whereas notching is either post-slipping pre- polishing or pre-slipping pre-polishing. This variety is extremely rare and has been found in the Goma and Kuak phases only. Tilema Dichrome: Tilema Variety (Fig. 20) Paste and surface finish. See under Lieza Self- Slipped: Lieza Variety. Surface treatment: two dif- ferent slips were applied in different zones. For discussion, see below under Decoration. Form. Shapes: dishes or basins with flaring walls often having a mid-rib break and a recurved rim (fig. 20f, g, m) ; the three latter profiles are diagnostic of the type; of low incidence are vessels without the miid- rib break (fig. 20b-d, h, j-l, n, o). Rims: usually slightly swollen (fig. 20d, 1), or slightly tapered (fig. 20e, k). Lips: rounded. Walls: occasionally their thickness increases toward the rim (fig. 20b1, d, k, 1). Bases: flat, usually forming a well-defined obtuse angle with the joining wall (fig. 20h, o); the walls on the exterior may be rounding toward the bases (fig. 20n). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 31.5 cm., extremes 28-34 cm. Height: estimated to be 5.5-7 cm. Wall thickness: averages 7`1 to 8 miim. Decoration. Technique: a red and a white slip were used.

The white-slipped zones usually extend on both sides of the rim; fewer than 10 per cent of the vessels have the entire outer surfaces white slipped in addition to the interior of the rim (fig. 20j-o). The white slips always have a uni- form shade; the red slips are usually clouded; occa- sionally the red slip on the inside is of a different shade from that on the outside. The red slip was applied first, then the white slip. The vessels were then polished. The white slip is dull, whereas the red slip attains a fair gloss. Overlap of the two slips is minimal, of one or two millimeters; often the slips do not meet, leaving a narrow unslipped zone between them. The white slip, thicker and coarser in texture than the red slip, has an emery-cloth tactile feel and contains minute mica spangles; it tends also to wear off easily. The texture and polish of the red slip are identical to those of the Diego flanged type. The aver- age width of the white zone is 3.4 cm. on the exterior (extremes, 3-3.8 cm.), and 0.9 mm. on the inte- rior (extremes, 1-18 mm.). Chronological position and popularity index. Goma through Kuak phases (fig. 9). Peaks of popularity were reached in the Goma and Kuak phases. Temporal differences. During the Goma phase about one-fourth of the vessels have a red slip; the remainder have a reddish-brown slip. This proportion is reversed in the Kuak phase. Moreover, as time elapses, the width of the white-slipped zone increases noticeably. Site occurrence. This variety occurs both at Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. This variety reflects some crude manu- facture not found in similar types such as Lieza Self- Slipped, Xiwi Red-Slipped, or Diego Flanged. Diego Flanged: Diego Variety (Fig. 21a-h) Paste, surface finish, and surface treatmizenit. See under Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety. Color of slip: reddish-brown colors prevail, such as MIahogany Red, Cacao Brown, Vinaceous Tawny, Vinaceous Rufous, Ferruginous, and Kaiser Brown. One sherd is black; another is red outside and black inside. At times the slip is slightly streaked on the inside surfaces such as may result from an uneven application of the slip. Clouds due to uneven firing are not uncommon. Form. Shape: the only identified shape is that of a basin or dish with straight flaring walls, or slightly outcurving or slightly incurving walls (fig. 20a-h). Rims: direct. Lips: rounded; the majority are per- fectly semicircular in profile; the latter feature is diag- nostic. Walls: usually more vertically set than those of similar vessels of other types. Bases: none posi- cm scale FIG. 22. Pixixi Daub: Pixixi Variety, Gomna phase.</page><page sequence="43">44 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. tively identified; those basal sherds tentatively assigned to this Variety are flat and form a well-defined angle with the walls. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 27.5 cm., extremes 24-32 cm. Height: estimated to be 8.5 cm. Wall thickness: average 6.5 mm.; it remains equal from rim to base. Decoration. Techniques: modeling and painting. Elements: flange or prominent ridge applied on the exterior of the lip or rim; this element is usually be- tween a true labial flange and a rim ridge. According to Robert E. Smith who explained the difference, a sherd with a flange can be lifted by grasping the flange between the thumb and the forefinger; the sherd with the ridge cannot. The painted element usually consists of a narrow red band applied to the lip (fig. 21c-h). As has been observed on Xiwi Red-Slipped vessels, the red band can hardly be distinguished from the slip. It seems that the red color used for the lips is identical to that used for the slip, but of a deeper shade. We infer that the planned two-tone contrast got lost during the firing, and that all lips were painted with a red band. Chronological position. Goma through Kuak phases (fig. 9). Temporal differences. In the Kuak phase, the flanges or prominent ridges evolve into low ridges or mere thickening of the rims. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. This variety is distinctive and easily identifiable. Pixixi Daub: Pixixi Variety (Fig. 22) Paste, surface finish, and surface treatment. See under Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety. Surface color: see under Diego Flanged: Diego Variety. Form. Shape: ovate bowl with direct, teardrop-like rim, rounded walls with buckled-in sides resulting in a figure-eight shaped mouth; the base is flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim length is 31 cm., its width, 22 cm. The bowl is 20.2 cm. high; the wall averages 7 mm. in thickness. Decoration. Techniques: daubing combined with fine incising. Elements: hatched triangles; straight and scalloped incised lines; red-painted patches, swirls, and corkscrew-like designs. Designs: two parallel incised lines encircle the exterior of the rim just below the lip; a scalloped line is incised around both ends below the two parallel lines; the concave sides are decorated with alternating, obliquely hatched triangles; a red band was applied to the rim, and swirls and corkscrew-like de- signs to the remaining area. Excess paint ran down on the inside and the outside. Subsequent polishing spread the paint, and caused the edges of painted areas to become fuzzy. Chronological position. Goma phase (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza. Discussion. Pending further excavations in the area, this variety will remain unique in shape and decoration. Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety (Fig. 23a-g, o-r) Paste. Temper: fairly abundant unevenly grained particles ranging from silty to fine (?256-1/4 mm.), consisting mainly of quartz and mica; there are some large stray particles of quartz up to 2 mm. in diameter. Texture: compact and hard; laminated and porous pastes occur. Color: black, occasionally grayish-black from surface to surface. Fracture: fairly straight to straight; fresh breaks have clean, sharp edges. Firing: smudged, except the exterior surfaces of the rims, which are oxidized. Sufrface. Finish: the surfaces were carefully evened and smoothed prior to slipping. Treatment: slipped. The slip cannot always be detected because its color cannot be distinguished from that of the underlying paste. Therefore, we presume that the slip is identical to the clay used for the paste. The slips are well polished and attain a fair gloss. Color of slip: black to Slate Black; the outer rim surfaces are cream, off- white, sometimes yellowish-orange. Form. Shapes: the dominant shape is the bowl (fig. 23a-e); the shapes illustrated in figure 23f and g are uncommon. Rims: usually direct. Lips: rounded. Bases: flat; the junction where the wall meets the base is either rounded or angular. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average, 27.5 cm., extremes, 19-34 cm. Height: estimated between 6 and 9 cm. Decoration. Technique: the decoration was achieved by means of a special technique which caused the cores and surfaces to fire black, and the exterior surfaces of rims to turn into a whitish color. Sometimes the whole exterior surface is white. Robert Sonin, whom we consulted on this matter, believes that, while the exte- rior surfaces of rims were exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere, the remaining area, protected by leaves or grass, or possibly ashes, retained the carbon of the organic material through "insorbtion" during firing. Vessels may also have been stacked one on top of the other, bottoms up, with a layer of grass or leaves be- tween them during firing; the latter technique would account for the bowls (the ones on top of the piles) which have their entire exterior surfaces oxidized. Other firing methods may be envisioned. The oxidized band is of variable width; it extends from 1 to 2 mm. on the interior to 11,4 to 2 cm. on the exterior. The demarcation line between the black and the white zones is usually fuzzy; mottled and clouded areas occur. Chronological position and popularity index.

Site occurrence. This variety occuirs mainly at Boca del Rio; one sherd only was found at Lieza. Discussion. This Variety is highly distinctive in shape and technique of decoration. There are four more types decorated by the same firing technique: Untempered Black-and-White, Waxy Black-and-White, Tehuantepec Black-and-White, and Finie-Grained Black-and-White. Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified (Figs. 24-27a-f ) Paste. Temper: except for a few large orange-brown inclusions, no temper is visible to the naked eye. Tex- ture: china-like and very dense. Color: light to deep gray throughout; some sherds verge on beige, some on grayish-black. Fracture: straiglht aind conchoidal, with clean, sharp edges. Firing: unoxidized; firing clouds, mottling, or crazing are absent. Hardnless: extremiiely hard and break-resistant. Slherds give off a clear metallic ring when struck. Surface. Finislh: comllpacted and smllootlh; exterior surfaces are usually well polished, often to a miiirror-like finish. Interior surfaces of jars are always' wiped; exterior surfaces are infrequently wiped also. The nmarks left by the polishing tools are barely visible. Small lumps of clay usually adhere to the interior sur- faces; they may have been smoothed over; they seem to be indicative of mass production. Color: Smoke Gray prevails; others are: Neutral Gray, Miouse Gray; Drab and Light Avellaneous are rare. Highly polished vessels tend to be Slate Black. Form. Shapes: the fragmentary nature of the sherds suggests the following shapes (in order of decreasing popularity) : tecomates (figs. 24b, c, i, j; 25a, i, o);</page><page sequence="45">46 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

The main evolutionary changes observed are as follows: walls tend to become thicker, vessels larger, bases more concave, and the number of shapes and decorative elements increases. For a full discussion, see under the culture phase beading. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. Radani Gray is an extremely distinctive type. It is one of the best, though not the finest, en- countered in our excavations. It is a ceramic unit quite separate from and unrelated to other types and varieties. On the whole, the vessels are small. Many shapes and designs are diagnostic of this type. One of its most characteristic features is that, despite its excellent qual- ity, it was turned out with great speed. We seem to be dealing here with a mass-produced ware. Exquipulas Burnished: Exquipulas Variety (Figs. 28; 29c, f; 30g-o; 31h-q) Paste. Temper, texture fracture, and firing: see under Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety. Color: black cores with dark brown to cinnamon surface layers. Surface. Finish: smoothed, grainy. Roughened areas where coils meet are frequent. Cracks and pits are common on the interior surfaces. The smoothness and the extent of rough areas vary greatly. Occasionally manufacturing imperfections were concealed under a thick coat of slip of limited extent. The burnishing of the surface, which pressed the coarse tempering parti- cles into the paste, involves part or the whole of the vessels. The surfaces are frequently marked with ran- dom lines from the burnishing tool. Color: blackish brown to cinnamon. The surfaces are usually varie- gated, so that different colors are present on the same sherd. Form. Shapes: jars with globular to biconical bodies. Rims: they vary between narrow and wide; there are two types of rims: the one forming a con- tinuous curve with the wall and neck (figs. 28a-d, m-r), and one joining the body at a well-defined angle (fig.</page><page sequence="51">52 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

The rim is the only part of</page><page sequence="52">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE POTTERY 53 the jars that shows evolutionary changes through time. From a continuous curve type (fig. 28a-d) in the early Goma phase, it evolves into a wide everted rim forming an obtuse angle with the body (fig. 28e-h) in the late Goma phase, and finally into a broad, flat everted rim in the Kuak phase (fig. 28i-l). This transformation resulted from the introduction of a new technique of building up the rims. They are no longer built up by the coiling method, but are produced sepa- rately; they are added to the body in the form of a clay slab which is welded to the inside top of the body, then folded back. This method was presumably intro- duced with the Zuleta Red-Slipped jars, which are all built in this manner. The wide rims average 5.2 cm. in width, whereas the continuous curve neck type averages only 3.5 cm. in width. Later, during the Niti phase, there is a reversal to jars with continuous curve niecks (fig. 28m-o). The rim profile illustrated in figure 31p appears for the first time in the Niti phase. Site occiurrence. Lieza and Boca del RRio. Discussion. Generally speaking, this variety has a crude and heavy appearance. Exquipulas Burnished: Laollaga Variety (Figs. 29a, b, d, e, g-n; 30a-f; 31a-g, r, s) Paste and surface. See under Exquipulas Burnished: Exquipulas Variety. Form. Shapes: jars (fig. 29a, b, d, e, g-n), ex- tremely rare, are identical to those of the Exquipulas Variety; tecomcates (fig. 30d, f) ; basins or dishes with straight flaring walls (figs. 30e; 31f) ; plates with out- curving walls (fig. 30b); composite or S-Z angle bowls (figs. 30a, c; 31g); vases (fig. 31a-e, s). Rims: usu- ally direct; bolster (fig. 30e) ; everted (fig. 31r) thickened (fig. 31s). Lips: convex. Bases: flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: see under Ex- quipulas Variety. Decoration. Techniques: light incising (figs. 29d, e, i, m, n; 30c, d; 31a-c); groove incising (figs. 29a, g, h; 30a, b, e, f; 31d-f, s); filleting (fig. 29h, k, m, n); punctating (fig. 30b); plain incising (crosshatching (fig. 30a); ridging (fig. 29b); corrugating (fig. 291); fluting (fig. 29j); notching which is the prevailing method (figs. 29h, n; 31r); facetting (figs. 29k, m; 31f, g). Elements: straight and curved lines, hatched triangles, rows of punctations. Designs: sets of parallel lines (figs. 29d, e, g-i, m, n; 30c, e; 31b, d-f) ; single or multiple lines encircling the rims on the exterior (figs. 29a; 30a, b, f), or on top of lips (fig. 30e); crosshatched triangles (fig. 30a); hatched open tri- angles (fig. 31c); wavy lines (fig. 30d); rows of punc- tations (fig. 30b); broken zig-zag lines (fig. 31s). Chronological position and popularity index. Goma through Xuku phase. This variety is fairly popular (fig. 9)- Temporal differences. Notching is particularly char- acteristic during the Kuak phase. Rim profiles such as shown in figure 31s are typical of the Niti phase. Discussion. In all other respects, this variety is identical to the Exquipulas Variety. MISCELLANEOUS Several groups of pottery of the Goma phase, with no definite typological status, are described below. They do not appear in the bar-chart in figure 9, but in tables 1-3. Slipped-Gray (Fig. 32a, b) Corpus. Two sherds. Paste. Temper: abundant fine sand (1/8-1/4 mm.) consisting chiefly of quartz and mica particles. Tex- ture: very dense and homogeneous. Color: Mouse Gray to Neutral Gray from surface to surface. Frac- ture: straight. Firing: reduced; even. Hardness: extremely hard; sherds give off a metallic ring when struck. Surface. Finish: under the slip the surfaces are well compacted, evenly smoothed, and grainy. No marks of smoothing tools are visible. Treatment: slipped and polished; polish has a low lustre. Color: the slip is Neutral Gray and has some milky-white patches; it is a shade darker than the paste, and is probably identical to the base clay used for the paste. Form. Shapes: the only two rim sherds available indicate vessels of moderate sizes. The one shown in figure 32b probably belongs to a bowl with a rounded lip; the other in figure 32a may be part of a jar. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: Sherds are too small to be measured. Wall thickness: average, 51/4 mm. Decoration. One groove is incised around the outer rim below the lip (fig. 32a). Chronological position. Late Goma phase (tables 2 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Green-Paste (Fig. 32c-e) Corpus. Three sherds. Paste. Temper: fair amount of rhyolite including black particles, yellowish-orange lumps of limestone, and obsidian; quartz particles are rare, and mica is absent. The grains vary between fine and granule (16-4 mm.). Texture: granular though compact. Color: Tea Green throughout. Fracture: fairly straight to irregular. Firing: uniform. Surface. Finish: fairly well smoothed and com- pacted. Treatment: slipped and polished; the larger temper particles protrude and impeded proper polish- ing; the slip is an even, thick, and contrastive layer;</page><page sequence="53">54 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC TIRANS.

Color: the slip is Drab and has light grayish-olive stains. Form. Shapes: one rim sherd suggests the existence of jars with continuous curve necks and everted rims (fig. 32c). Base: flat, forming a well-defined obtuse angle with the flaring wall (fig. 32d). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter of jar: 18 cm. Wall thickness: average, 4 mm. Decoration. Techniques: groove and fine incising, post-slipping, post-polishing. Elements: curved and scalloped lines. Designs: the exterior surface of the shoulder of the jar bears a simple S-shaped pattern of fine incised lines which may have been produced by means of a comb. One groove incised line runs around the rim on the exterior below the lip (fig. 32c). The basal sherd in figure 32d has a pattern made of fine light grooved lines which are made of a series of short arcs joined end to end. The body sherd in figure 32e has two concentric grooved lines which seem to be part of a larger design. Chronological position. Goma phase (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. The nature of the temper is highly distinctive and has not been observed in any other ceramic units. Olive-Buff (Fig. 32f) Corpus. Eleven sherds. Paste.

Texture: granular and very friable by virtue of the high temper content. Color: Olive-Buff. Fracture: fresh breaks are moderately straight to jagged. Firing: fairly uniform. Surface. Finish: preserved surfaces are evenly smoothed and well compacted. Treatment: slipped; the slip is thin, hard, and covered with a network of minute cracks; it was polished to a mirror-like gloss. Marks of polishing tools are faintly visible. Color: like the core, the slip is Olive-Buff, but of a darker shade; it also has some brownish and blackish clouding. Form. Shapes: information on vessel shapes is con- fined to what can be inferred from one single rim sherd, that of a basin, probably with an everted rim (fig. 32f). The body sherds suggest the presence of jars. Dimen- sions: exterior rim diameter of basin: 32.5 cm. Wall thickness: average, 81/2 mm. Decoration. Techniques: light incising, post-slipping, post-polishing; building up of ridges. Designs: mean- dering low ridges on jars applied before slipping. One sherd bears a single light incised line barely visible to the naked eye. Chronological position. Early Goma phase (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. The temper affords a valuable criterion for identifying this ceramic unit, because it does not conform to the norms encountered so far, and would suggest that we are dealing with a trade ware.

Seven sherds, all rims. Paste. Temper: fair to abundant silty material, probably extremely fine sand. Texture: compact, with some slight lamination. Color: the core is dark gray to blackish gray, and is between two thin light brown layers. Fracture: straight. Firing: even; partly oxi- dized. Hardness: the sherds are hard and brittle; they give off a metallic ring when struck. Surface. Finish: surfaces are well compacted owing to careful polishing; the rim, meant to receive a coat of white paint, was left unpolished. Marks of polishing tools are somewhat visible. Color: Hairbrown to Fuscous; the interior surfaces of the rims tend to be lighter in color. Form. Shapes: the only shape identified is a bowl or dish with flaring straight walls or with very slightly rounded walls. Rims: direct. Lips: rounded. Walls: their thickness increases from base to lip. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average, 25 cm. Wall thickness: average, 4.5 mm. Lip thickness: average, 6 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting. Design: it con- sists of a cream-colored band on the outside of the rims, extending from the lip to a point about 18 mm. down the wall. Chronological position. Late Goma phase (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. This ware is of great interest because it is a perfect imitation of Guizi Black-and-White, so skillfully and faithfully made, that it withstood the test of two sortings before its true nature was discovered. Red-on- White (Fig. 32i-k) Corpus. Four sherds. Paste. Temper: moderately to fairly abundant par- ticles varying between silty and fine (1//)86-1/4 mm.), and consisting chiefly of quartz and mica. Texture: compact to very dense. Color: black, dark gray, or grayish-black from surface to surface. Fracture: fairly straight with sharp edges. Firing: cloudiness due to firing occurs mostly on the exterior surfaces. Surface. Finish: compacted and well smoothed under the slip. There are no marks from the smooth- ing tool. Treatment: slipped; the slip is thick and has a satiny sheen; a fine network of minute cracks covers most areas. Color of slip: Cream, off-white, buff, light beige; the slip is clouded. Form. Shapes: the material at hand, insufficient to give an accurate shape description, suggests dishes or basins with flaring to nearly straight erect walls. Rims: usually everted. Lips: rounded (fig. 32j); flattened (fig. 32k); or pointed (fig. 32i). Walls: they become larger from base to lip. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: 25-35 cm. Wall thickness: 6 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting. Design: red band confined to the top of the lip or the everted rim. Fig- ure 32k illustrates a sherd decorated with a semicircular line. The coloring material seems to be ground specular hematite. Chronological position. Late Goma phase (tables 2 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion.

Variegated (Fig. 32t-c') Corpus. Nineteen sherds. Paste. Temper: sparse to moderate amount of un- evenly sized particles ranging from silty to fine (1%2-1/4 mm.). Texture: dense; occasionally porous or lami- nated. Color: black to dark brown throughout. Frac- ture: fairly straight; fresh breaks have clean, sharp edges. Firing: even. Surface. Finish: under the slip the surfaces are evenly compacted by careful smoothing. Treatment: it seems that the surfaces are coated with a thin slip which consists of the same clay as that used for the paste. Color of slip: Cinnamon Brown and Seal Brown prevail. Form. Shapes: owing to the fragmentary nature of the sherds, shapes can only be conjectured. The shapes seem to include: jars with straight insloping walls (fig. 32t); jars with slightly everted rims (fig. 32v); bowls or dishes (fig. 32w, y). Rims: usually everted. Lips: rounded or thickened. Bases: flat and rounded. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: jars with straight insloping walls, average 18 cm.; bowls or dishes, average 26.5 cm. Wall thickness: average 5-6 mm. Decoration. Techniques: groove incising (fig. 32t, x, z); fine incising (fig. 32t); plain incising (fig. 32v, w). Incising is post-slipping, post-polishing, and pre- firing. Facetting (fig. 32a'); modeling of ridges (fig. 32z, a'). Elements: straight and curved lines; hatched triangles.

Chronological position. Goma and Tixum phases (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. The sherds connected with the Formative were found at Boca del Rio; the single sherd related to the Classic was found at Lieza. Discussion. The thickness, the polish, and the spar- kling mica dust on the surfaces are the diagnostic criteria which identify this ware. THE KUAK PHASE The ceramic complex of the Kuak phase does not reveal the presence of any spectacular new features. There are four new type varieties and numerous varia- tions, which provide valuable criteria for assessing the character of this phase. Failing to receive the proper cultural stimuli from the outside, the prehistoric potters seem to have been left to their own devices. They elaborated on inherited traditions which often resulted in drabber wares of poorer quality. The deterioration process begun in the late Goma phase affects primarily the quality of the pastes and slips. Pastes tend to be slightly more friable and slips less glossy. The apparent exception in this deterioration is Radani Gray which follows a progres- sive evolutionary trend during the Kuak phase. Controlled firing is attested to by Guizi Black-and- White and possibly Radani Gray. It is probable that the red slip of the Zuleta Red-Slipped vessels was also obtained through controlled firing rather than through ~~~~e I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I r ~m 0 n 5 cm scale 0 ~~~5 10 cm scale cm scale r FIG. 33.

SOC. the use of a special clay. Generally speaking, the ves- sels of the Kuak phase have dark cores and surfaces. The four new ceramic types and varieties are: Zuleta Red-Slipped: Varieties Unspecified, Binisu Gray: Binisu Variety, Radani Gray: Mata Variety, and Diego Flanged: Quialoi Variety. There are also several ceramic groups which have no definite typological status. One shape only characterizes the vessels of Zuleta Red-Slipped, that of a jar with globular to bi- conical body and a flat, broad, everted rim forming a well-defined, often acute, angle with the body wall. Binisu Gray: Binisu Variety, distinguishable by its composite bowls (S-Z angle bowls) and its deep V-shaped incised designs usually cutting more than halfway through the wall thickness, has a short exist- ence and dies out by the end of the Niti phase. Radani Gray: Mata Variety is characterized by vessels with red filled incised lines. The Diego Flanged: Quialoi Variety is the incised version of the Diego Variety. The zone between the lip and the tip of the flange is decorated with incised designs. The dominant types of the Kuak phase are Exquipu- las Burnished, Radani Gray, and Zuleta Red-Slipped. Guizi Black-and-White, Lieza Self-Slipped, and Ven- tosa Russet are also popular. During the Kuak phase the rims of the Exquipulas Burnished jars are no longer built up by means of the coiling method, but are added in the form of a slab of clay welded to the inside top of the body walls and then folded back; the rims form a well-defined and acute angle with the bodies. This technological innovation was foreshadowed at the close of the Goma phase and seems to be related to the introduction of the Zuleta Red-Slipped jars. Shapes quite popular during the Kuak phase include: the bowl and handle censer probably introduced with the building of ceremonial platforms; dishes with everted grooved rims; and cylindrical vases, occasion- ally with lateral ridges. Generally speaking, jars be- come more numerous during this phase. The remain- ing shapes such as bowls, tecomates, dishes with straight flaring or outcurving walls, jars with bulging necks, vessels with bulging bases, and composite bowls are retained with minor variations in profiles. The heyday of Radani Gray is in the Kuak phase. Still mass-produced, this type follows an evolutionary path of its own. Over 70 variations of rim-lip profiles have been identified, the most conspicuous being the "forked" lip, probably a variant of the labial flange. New decorative elements such as stick-burnished lines, piecrust lips, and split bosses also characterize Radani Gray vessels. Notching of basal breaks is the most used technique to decorate vessels of the Exquipulas Burnished: Laollaga Variety. Artistic creation in the field of decoration suffers from sterility. Decorated pots are few. Painted vessels are almost entirely absent. The basic decorative ele- ments of the Kuak phase are carry-overs from the Goma phase. New elements include: hatched triangles com- bined with circles, arrangements of straight and wavy lines, and straight lines flanked with rows of punc- tations. The oxidized zones of the Guizi Black-and-White bowls often have a pale yellowish-orange color, but they turn again into off-white and cream colors at the very end of the Kuak phase. The white-slipped zones of the Tilema Dichrome vessels widen during the Kuak phase and occasionally extend over the entire exterior surfaces. Elements that are no longer present are: daub paint- ing, slant incising, and Lieza Self-Slipped jars with notched fillets. Binisu Gray: Binisu Variety (Fig. 34) Paste and surface. See under Radani Gray: Radani Variety. Form. Shape: composite or S-Z angle bowls with convex or flat bases. Rims: direct or modified by a low ridge (fig. 34f, k). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 21.5 cm., extremes 13-32 cm. Decoration. Techniques: notching and deep V- shaped groove incising; the lines penetrate more than halfway through the walls. Elements: hatched open triangles (fig. 34e, g, j); arcs (fig. 34d, f, h, k) ; S- shaped or wavy lines (fig. 34a, i). Designs: concentric arcs alternating with multiple horizontal wavy lines (fig. 34d, f, h) ; chevron-like arrangements (fig. 34c); repeated hatched open triangles (fig. 34e, g, j); rows of notches on lateral breaks (fig. 34a, i). Chronological position and popularity index. Kuak and Niti phases (fig. 9). This variety reaches its peak of popularity in the Kuak phase. Three sherds were found in the uppermost Goma levels. Temporal differences. The groove incised lines are shallower in the Niti phase than in the preceding Kuak phase. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Zuleta Red-Slipped: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 35) Paste. See under Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety. The Zuleta Red-Slipped paste is slightly coarser than that of the Lieza Variety. Color: the core is dark gray to black; the surface layers are cinnamon to orange. Surface. Finish: except for the exterior surfaces of the rims of the jars which are crudely wiped or scraped, all other surfaces are well smoothed. Treatment: slipped; the slip is soft and covers the exterior surfaces of the jars and the interior surfaces of the rims. In some areas the slip is very thick, in others, very thin.</page><page sequence="62">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 THE POTTERY 63 ab /~~~ e/ //~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~V c '','~ ~ d e ,, v g~~~~~~~~ h _ _ j 1- 0 5 10 cm scale 'I FIG. 34.

Only the slips on the interior surfaces of the rims are bright red; those of the bodies are brownish-red to blackish-red. Robert Sonin, who kindly examined this variety, suggested that the red color of the slip was achieved through firing alone and is not necessarily the result of the use of a clay different from that of the paste. Form. Shape: the standard shape is a jar with a globular to biconical body (fig. 35a). Rims: almost all rims are wide everted, usually flat, slightly dish- shaped, or slightly outcurving, and form a well-defined angle with the body walls; they average 6.4 cm. in width. They were not built up by means of the coiling method, but were added to the bodies in the form of slabs of clay welded to the inside top of the body walls;</page><page sequence="63">64 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the welding was often reinforced by a clay rod applied in the outside angle formed by the rim and the body wall. Lips: rounded; occasionally flattened. Base: rounded. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 19 cm., extremes 17 and 21 cm. Height: the jar illustrated in figure 35a is 23 cm. high. Wall thickness: average, 7 mm. Decoration. The two sherds illustrated in figure 35b and c may represent a different type or variety related to Zuleta Red-Slipped. We feel that these two sherds do not warrant setting up a new type or variety.

Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. Zuleta Red-Slipped seems to be an oxi- dized version of Lieza Self-Slipped. Radani Gray: Mata Variety (Fig. 27g-k) This variety appears for the first time in the Kuak phase. It is identical to the Radani Gray Variety ex- cept that the incised lines are filled with a red pigment. It has a short duration (fig. 9). Diego Flanged: Quialoi Variety (Fig. 21i-k) This variety appears for the first time in the Kuak phase (fig. 9). The zone between the lip and the tip of the flange has been decorated with incised motifs such as hatched open triangles (fig. 21i). Incising was done after the slipping and polishing, but before the firing. The incised lines have blurred edges and pene- trate through the slip into the paste. Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety (Fig. 14) This variety carries over from the Goma phase into the Kuak phase without any change in paste or sur- face finish. Basins with thick flattened grooved lips are now virtually absent. One new element in the decoration is the combination of rows of punctations with flanking straight parallel lines (fig. 14b, c). New variations in rim profiles of the Kuak phase are shown in figure 14a-t. Xiwi Red-Slipped: Xiwi Variety (Fig. 18c-g, m, n) This variety continues from the Gomna phase. A slightly cruder workmanship is noticeable. Cylindrical vases with or without ridged rims (fig. 18f) are new. Xiwi Red-Slipped: Lidgi Variety (Fig. 18a, b, h-l, o) This variety continues from the Goma phase. Sev- eral new shapes characterize this phase: dishes or basins with outcurving walls and everted grooved rims (fig. 18a, b); and cylindrical vases with notched ridges (fig. 18j). Ventosa Russet: Ventosa Variety (Fig. 19n, p-t) This variety continues from the preceding phase. Jars which made a sudden appearance at the end of the Goma phase are now as numerous as open vessels.</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE POTTERY 65 Toward the end of the Kuak phase, Ventosa Russet jars tend to resemble those of the Zuleta Red-Slipped type. Ventosa Russet: Garza Variety (Fig. 19o) This variety dies out in this phase. Tilema Dichrome: Tilema Variety (Fig. 20c) This variety continues from the Goma phase. Red- slipped vessels are now three times as numerous as brownish-red ones. The width of the white-slipped zone increases noticeably during this phase; it averages 4 cm. on the outside, and 2.2 cm. on the inside. Vessels with mid-rib breaks are decreasing in number, while the number of vessels with rounded walls is increasing. Diego Flanged: Diego Variety This variety becomes extinct in this phase. Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety (Fig. 23b, c, f, g) This variety carries over into the Kuak phase without any change in paste or surface finish. Two new shapes appear: a tecomate (fig. 23f), and a dish or plate with straight flaring walls (fig. 23g) ; the latter shapes are unique and do not persist. Yellowish-orange oxidized rims are predominant during the Kuak phase, and dis- appear at the very end of it. Sometimes an inter- mediary whitish zone occurs between the black bodies and the oxidized rims. Standards of manufacture and firing were less rigorously adhered to. Loss of firing skill and the introduction of new shapes produce the Pixana Variety in the succeeding Niti phase. Walls average 6 mm. in thickness; this indicates an evolution toward thicker-walled vessels. Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 25) In paste and surface finish this variety is carried over into the Kuak phase with no visible changes. There is an elaboration of rim and lip profiles. The new varia- tions include: piecrust lips (fig. 25m) ; jars with "forked" lips (fig. 25n) ; bowls with slightly everted rims (fig. 25e, 1); bowls with ridged rims (fig. 25f, g); and ring bases (fig. 25c'). Several new variations in decorative elements which appear in this phase are: combinations of wavy and straight lines (fig. 25p, u, v); parallel straight lines flanked with rows of punctations (fig. 25s, t) ; pattern burnishing (fig. 25n, a') ; split bosses or knobs (fig. 25y); and chamfering (fig. 25z). Exquipulas Burnished: Exquipulas Variety (Figs. 28i-1; 31h-n) This variety carries over into the Kuak phase with- out marked changes. Jars with wide everted rims now outnumber jars with continuous curve necks, 43 to 33. The most popular open vessels are bowls or dishes with slightly everted rims. Exquipulas Burnished: Laollaga Variety (Figs. 29g-1; 31a-g) The decorative designs are much simpler than in the Goma phase and include only arrangements of parallel lines occasionally combined with notches. Light incis- ing remains the prevailing decorative technique. The notching of basal breaks becomes an established norm. The decorative innovations of the Kuak phase are as follows: notching and finger facetting of fillets on jars (fig. 29h, k); fluting (one example) (fig. 29j); and corrugating (one example) (fig. 291). The Kuak phase is also characterized by vases with almost vertical walls (fig. 31a--e). MISCELLANEOUS Several unspecified groups of ceramics belonging to the Kuak phase are described below. Silty-Glazey (Fig. 33f, g) Corpus. Four sherds. Paste. Temper: undefined silty aplastic 1/'256 mm.) containing some tiny mica spangles and a few yellowish lumps. Texture: dense, homogeneous. Color: beige- brown to orange throughout. Fracture: fresh breaks are straight and have sharp clean edges. Firing: even. Surface. Finish: compacted by means of careful smoothing. The surfaces are even. Treatment: slipped; the slip is hard, thin, and glazey. Despite some color contrast between the color of the surface and the color of the slip, the presence of a distinct slip cannot always be ascertained. This ware may be self- slipped. Color: the slip is brown; firing clouds occur. Form. Shapes: the two available rim sherds sug- gest the presence of dishes and vases. Rims: direct; everted (fig. 33f, g). Lips: rounded. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: vessel with the everted rim, 29 cm. Wall thickness: 7.5 mm. Chronological position. Kuak phase (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. Silty-Glazey is one of the finest wares in the collection, exhibiting accomplished craftsmanship. Fine-Grained Painted (Fig. 33h) Corpus. One sherd. Paste. Temper: fair amount of very fine-grained sand (1/8-1/4 mm.). Texture: compact, with a tendency to be friable. Color: brown throughout. Fracture: fairly straight. Firing: partially oxidized. Surface.

Chronological position. Early Kuak and Niti phases (tables 1-3). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. THE NITI PHASE The ceramic decadence initiated in the preceding phases now abruptly proceeds at a more rapid pace. Technical norms are no longer strictly observed. Pots are made in a slap-dash manner; the slips are dull and wear off readily; the pastes tend to be friable; the number of shapes has dropped considerably. The ceramic complex of the Niti phase is dominated by a new variety, Atempan Scraped: Atempan Variety, a crude household ware characterized by huge storage jars. Two less important varieties and several ceramic units with no typological status also make their appear- ance during the Niti phase: Guizi Black-and-White: Pixana Variety, Xiwi Red-Slipped: Bigu Variety, Fugitive Red-Slipped, two waxy wares, Waxy Black- and-White and Waxy Fine-Paste, and Polychrome- Stuccoed. The vessels of the Guizi Black-and-White: Pixana Variety have white and black spots on the entire outer surfaces, and unlike those of the Guizi Variety, do not have white fired rims and black bodies. The vessels of the Xiwi Red-Slipped: Bigu Variety are coated on one side only with a poor quality slip. Several features characteristic of this phase are: dishes or bowls with thickened rims, composite or S-Z angle bowls with blade incised designs, and stucco painting. Atempan Scraped: Atempan Variety (Fig. 36) Paste. Temper: fairly abundant irregularly sized particles, medium coarse to coarse (1/4-1 mm.) con- sisting mainly of angular quartz particles; mica is al- most entirely absent. Texture: dense, homogeneous, and hard; lamination occurs; splits and cracks occur in the center of the core. Color: dark gray cores between or grading into light orange-buff superficial layers. Fracture: fresh breaks have jagged edges. Firing: oxidized surfaces and reduced or carbonized cores. Surface. Finish: the surfaces range from rough to smooth and usually have a grainy appearance. They are conspicuously uneven and undulating; apparently they were scraped while still wet with a broad-bladed tool which left wide shallow troughs. Cracks, pits, and deep striations cover all the surfaces. Patchy, shiny surfaces are not uncommon. Color: Pinkish Cinnamon prevails, followed by Vinaceous Tawny, Avellaneous and Japan Rose. Firing clouds are characteristic. Form. Shapes: two shapes have been identified, a large composite plate with a rounded base and out- curving walls (fig. 36c, d) and jars (fig. 36a, b) with continuous curve necks and rims, rounded lips, and slightly convex bases (fig. 36i). Appendages: the jars had two or three-knobbed lugs welded on a decorative fillet (fig. 36g, h) ; these lugs are too small to be held with the fingers, but may have provided a firm grip for moving these jars around. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: the jars aver- age 33 cm. Body diameter of the jars: varies between 80 and 100 cm. Decoration. Technique: fillets and ridges were applied on the shoulders of the jars. Ridges have a triangular cross-section, fillets are rounded in cross- section. Two or three-knobbed lugs were placed at intervals on the ridges and fillets. Chronological position and popularity index. Kuak through Xuku phases. This variety reaches its peak of popularity during the Niti phase (fig. 9). Discussion. There is a remarkable similarity between the popularity curves of this variety and of the clam species Anadara esmeralda and A. grandis (compare bar-charts in fig. 9 and fig. 86). This similarity sug- gests that the people who made the Atempan Scraped jars also collected the Anadara clams.

Moreover, 20 per cent of the vessels are dishes with recurved walls (fig. 23i-l) or composite or S-Z angle bowls (fig. 23m, n). Xiwi Red-Slipped: Bigu Variety (Fig. l8s-w) This variety is new and appears for the first time in the Niti phase. The open vessels are slipped on one side only. The slip is soft and wears off readily. The vessels slipped on the outside are illustrated in figure 18t, and those on the inside are shown in figures 18s, u-w. Bigu Variety is rare (fig. 9). Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety (Fig. 15a-d) This variety lingers on into the Niti phase. The thickness of the walls increases. A true innovation is the bowl or dish with a thickened rim or with a rim with very low ridges (fig. 15a-d) ; the exterior surface of the thickened rim is often incised with sets of one or two oblique lines forming a zig-zag pattern. Xiwi Red-Slipped: Xiwi Variety (Fig. 18p-r) This variety continues into the Niti phase. It is of poor quality.</page><page sequence="67">68 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Ventosa Russet: Ventosa Variety (Fig. 19u) This variety carries over from the Kuak phase. Open vessels have virtually disappeared, having been super- seded by jars. Bowls or dishes with thickened rims or with very low rim ridges are new (fig. 19u). The slips are soft and tend to wear off easily. The surfaces are well finished and polished. Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety (Fig. 23o) This variety continues from the Kuak phase. The paste and surface cannot be distinguished from those of the Kuak phase. One basal sherd has a six-scroll star painted on the interior surface in red specular hema- tite (fig. 23o). Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified (Figs. 26an, a', b') This type continues from the Kuak phase. Bases are now truly concave. Bowls outnumber tecomates for the first time. Vessels with "forked" lips, so characteristic during the Kuak phase, are now absent. A new decorative technique is blade incising. Blade-incised lines have deep, narrow troughs which penetrate deeply into the walls. The clay usually bulges on both sides of the lines. Blade-incised designs consist mainly of chevron-like arrangements of straight and wavy lines. Binisu Gray: Binisu Variety (Fig. 34j-k) During the Niti phase the width and the depth of the incised lines decrease. This type dies out toward the end of this phase at Boca del Rio, but lingers on into the Xuku phase at Lieza. Radani Gray: Mata Variety (Fig. 27i, j) This variety continues into the Niti phase from the Kuak phase without any changes in paste or surface finish. Exquipulas Burnished: Exquipulas Variety (Figs. 28nv-o; 31o-q) During the Niti phase we witness the resurgence of jars with continuous curve necks (fig. 28m-o) and a reversion to ancestral shapes. The thickness of walls and rims increases, and there is a greater variation in surface finish, which ranges from well smoothed to coarse. Bowls and dishes with thickened rims or with very low ridged rims (fig. 31p) appear for the first time during this phase. Exquipulas Burnished: Laollaga Variety (Figs. 29m, n; 31r, s) Notching, facetting, and light incising are the most popular decorative techniques of the Niti phase. Groove incising has now completely disappeared. The two sherds illustrated in figure 29m and nr demonstrate the persistence of decorative designs from the Goma through the Niti phase. The vessel with the everted rim and notched lip (fig. 31r) and the dish or bowl with the thickened rim or low ridged rim (fig. 31s) are new. Zuleta Red-Slipped: Varieties Unspecified This type continues from the preceding Kuak phase. Some small changes are noticeable: lips tend to be rounded, flattened lips have disappeared, and the sur- faces are better smoothed than in the Kuak phase. MISCELLANEOUS Unspecified ceramic groups associated with the Niti phase are described below. Crude-Coarse (Fig. 33m) Corpus. Eighteen sherds belonging to one single vessel. Paste. Temper: abundant coarse to very coarse grained particles, up to 2 and 3 mm. in diameter. No mica is present. Texture: granular; tends to crumble owing to the large amount of temper. Color: there is a gradual change from orange on the outside surface to black on the inside surface. Fracture: highly jagged. Firing: the exterior wall is oxidized; the interior is carbonized except the rim, which is oxidized on both sides. Surface. Finish: this vessel exhibits the crudest and most carelessly finished surface in the whole collection. Some limited areas received an additional coat of fine clay up to 3 mm. thick. The exterior surface was smoothed with a rounded tool which left short, narrow, and deep striations; the smoothing strokes are closely set and caused the surface to become undulated. The exterior surface is buff, the interior, black. Form. Shape: large plate or dish with rounded base; the wall terminates in a straight rim with a rounded lip. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: 32 cm. Wall thickness: average 9 mm. Height: estimated to be about 13 cm. Chronological position. Niti phase (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Vinaceous-Brown (Fig. 33n) Corpus. Twenty-four sherds from the same vessel. Paste and surface finish. See under Lieza Self- Slipped: Lieza Variety.</page><page sequence="68">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE POTTERY 69 Surface. Treatment: the exterior surface is slipped and polished; no marks of polishing tools are visible. Color of slip: Vinaceous Brown. Form. Shape: jar with globular body and cylindrical neck; the tip of the rim is turned outward; the lip is rounded; the base is flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: 10.5 cm. Wall thickness: 7.5 mm. Decoration. Technique: notching of basal break. Chronological position. Niti phase (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. This is the only example of a Formative period jar with cylindrical neck made of medium coarse paste; all other jars with cylindrical necks of the Formative period are made of fine pastes. Waxy Black-and-White (Fig. 33o) Corpus. Twenty-eight sherds from the same vessel. Paste. Temper: moderate to fair amount of fine grained temper (1/8-1/4 mm.). Texture: compact. Color: dark blackish-gray. Fracture: straight to jagged; fresh breaks have clean edges. Firing: even; carbonized inside, oxidized outside. Surface. Finish: the surface is carefully smoothed and polished and has a strong waxy tactile feel. It is difficult to ascertain the existence of a slip. Color: the rim and the inside surface are black; the remaining exterior surface is buff. Form. Shape: plate with rounded walls and lip turned slightly outward; the base is flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: 21 cm. Height: 4 cm. Wall thickness: 5 mm. Decoration. See under Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety. Chronological position. Niti phase (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. This plate has the same waxy feel as the Waxy Fine-Paste bowl found at Boca del Rio. Both may be trade pieces. Red-on-Orange-Buff (Fig. 33p) Corpus. Two sherds. Paste. Temper: moderate amount of irregularly sized particles ranging from fine to very coarse (1/4-2 mm.). Texture: compact. Color: one sherd has a black core and orange-buff surface; the second is orange-buff throughout. Fracture: jagged. Firing: incompletely to completely oxidized. Surface. Finish: evenly compacted by careful smoothing. Treatment: slipped with a light pinkish cinnamon wash; the slip attains a fair lustre. Form. Shape: the rim sherds suggest a dish or bowl with straight flaring walls and a direct rim widen- ing toward a lip which is beveled on the inside; the basal sherd suggests a bowl. Base: flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: bowl, about 19 cm. Wall thickness: 8.5 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting. Elements and design: red band around the foot of the interior wall and on top of the lip; oblique lines. Chronological position. Niti and Xuku phases (tables 2 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio.

Exterior rim diameter: 14 cm. Wall thickness: 9.5 mm. Chronological position. Niti phase (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. These sherds may belong to a variety of Xiwi Red-Slipped as yet unspecified.</page><page sequence="69">70 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC ITRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Polychrome-Stuccoed (not illustrated) Corpus. Two sherds. Paste. Temper: there are some stray particles up to 2 mm. in diameter. Texture: finely laminated. Color: the core, grayish-brown, is between two thin orange layers. Fracture: fairly straight edges; tends to flake at point of fracture. Firing: uneven. Surface. Finish: the interior surfaces are wiped; outside surfaces are polished. Color: Cinnamon Buff. Form. Shape: probably narrow mouth vessels. Dimensions. Wall thickness: 434 mm. Decoration.

THE XUKU PHASE The Classic Period is heralded by many new types, varieties, shapes, and decorative elements and tech- niques. Though the ceramic traditions of the Late Formative Period seem to have been submerged by a foreign ceramic industry, they did not completely dis- appear. Several types and varieties and a few designs and decorative techniques continue in the Classic Pe- riod, such as Radani Gray and blade incising. The ceramic complex of the Xuku phase is charac- terized by the excellent quality of the pastes and surface finish. The surfaces are usually extremely well smoothed and polished, and there are no marks from polishing tools. Firing of vessels has progressed a great deal. The potters now produce gray, white, or black pottery at will. Orange fired pottery is scarce, but it cannot be decided whether this scarcity results from the unpopu- larity of the orange color, to the unavailability of clays containing ferric oxides, or whether the technique of firing orange vessels was not yet fully mastered. Sur- faces marred by firing clouds are not uncommon. Fir- ing clouds are a distinctive trait of Tlacotepec Red-on- Clouded. The black and white decoration of Tehuan- tepec Black-on-White was achieved through carefully controlled firing presumably identical to that used in Guizi Black-and-White of the Formative Period. There are several clear-cut ceramic traditions. The most conspicuous is the white paste vessel tradition which includes several types and varieties such as Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded, Vixahui Medium-Coarse Slipped, Guia Painted, Ixtal Old-Ivory, Nichi Fine- Grained, and Espinal White-Slipped. This tradition extends through the Classic into the Postclassic Period. The most popular types and varieties of the Xuku phase are: Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded: Tlacotepec Variety, which is almost exclusively represented by one shape, that of a basin; Tehuantepec Black-and-White: Tehuantepec Variety; Huilotepec Decorated: Huilo- tepec Variety, of which only two shapes are known, a tripod dish and a bowl; Huayabal Leathery: Huayabal Variety, a household ware with a superb surface finish; Loteca Thick: Varieties Unspecified; Ixtal Old- Ivory: Ixtal Variety; and Morro Black: Morro Vari- ety. Quantitatively, Huayabal Leathery: Huayabal Variety prevails at Lieza, and Mitiac Domestic: Mitiac Variety, at Boca del Rio. Shapes which appear for the first timie are: tripod dishes with hollow legs, apaxtles or large basins with straight flaring walls, jars with tall cylindrical necks, grater bowls and dishes, large rounded plates or low bowls with extremely thick walls, painted trays, effigy vessels, and possibly floreros. Ceramic features which are distinctive of the Xuku phase include: rims with large grooves on the inside just below the lips, which characterize basins of the Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded and Tehuantepec Black- and-White types; crescent-shaped rims of the Huayabal Leathery jars; concave bases, and bulging bases which reappear after a long interval. Incising as a means of decoration is extremiely rare. Painting is much more frequent. Painted designs are simple. Those which are typical of the Classic Period are: scrolls, single or double S-shaped figures, hand- bell outlines, solid painted triangles with one serrated edge. The facetting of basal breaks is also commion. Plates with lateral flanges and Thin Orange ware are absent. Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded: Tlacotepec Variety (Figs. 37, 38a-m) Paste. Temper: moderate to fair amount of sand consisting chiefly of quartz particles, fine to medium coarse (1/8-12 mm.) ; mica is virtually absent. Tex- ture: fairly compact; cracks, pits, and lamination occur. Color: the core is usually black or grayish-black and turns into mouse gray, then into buff or pink near the surfaces; about one-fifth of the sherds are light yellow- ish-cream or cream throughout; several are black from surface to surface. Fracture: moderately jagged. Firing: uneven. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are fairly evenlly smoothed. Treatment: slipped and polished. The slip is hard; large protruding particles were dragged along by the polishing tool causing striations to appear; the slip is usually covered by a fine network of tiny cracks. Color of slip: Cartridge Buff, cream, off-white. Black firing clouds cover extensive areas and produce a two- tone effect not very different from that of vessels of the Guizi Black-and-White: Pixana Variety. Form. Shapes: nearly exclusively basins and dishes with straight flaring walls (figs. 37i, j, nml . r-u;</page><page sequence="70">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 THE POTTERY 71 a0b c d e i j k 49 ~~~~~~~~~m n 0 q~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ __ Jjv 0 ~~~~5 ji~]Black cm scale u Red FIG. 37.

Rims: usually direct; several are slightly everted (figs. 370, q, u; 38i, 1); about 40 per cent of the rim sherds have a wide shallow groove separating the lip from the rim (figs. 37j, k, p, r; 38a). Lips: there are two types, a rounded, often swollen, lip (largest proportion), and a flattened lip. Walls: their thickness increases from base to lip. Bases: flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: basins with outcurving walls, average 30 cm., extremes 25-36 cm.; basins with rounded walls, average 13 cm., extremes 12-15 cm.; basins with straight flaring walls, average 24 cm., extremes 19-26 cm. Height: average 7.5 cm. Wall thickness: average 8 mm., extremes 4.5-11.5 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting. Elements: straight, wavy, and zig-zag lines, triangular panels with serrated sides, handbell figures, diamonds. The line work is fairly bold. Designs: red band confined to the lips; one or two wavy lines between two straight lines (figs. 37m, p; 38i); sets of L-shaped lines (figs. 37k, r, v; 38b, j, k); groups of vertical or oblique wavy lines (figs. 371, n; 38a); uncommon designs are shown in figures 37o, s-u, and 38c, d, f, g, h, in. Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Tixum phase. This variety reaches its peak of popularity in the Early Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). Temporal differences. There is a marked drop in quality during the Tixum phase. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. The groove on the interior rim and the decoration are diagnostic features. Tehuantepec Black-and-White: Tehuantepec Variety (Fig. 38n-y) Paste and surface. See under Tlacotepec Red-on- Clouded: Tlacotepec Variety. Color of slip: both sur- faces of the vessels are black except the outside surfaces of the rims which are cream, off-white, drab, or white. Form. Shapes: 80 per cent of the vessels are bowls; the remainder are dishes or bowls with either straight flaring walls, slightly outcurving walls, or recurving walls. Rims: usually direct; occasionally thickening toward the lip (fig. 38n-p); some have a wide groove just below the lip on the inside (fig. 38r-v); piecrust rim (fig. 38x). Lips: rounded. Bases: flat. Hole for suspension: one example in figure 38w. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: bowls, average 30 cm., extremes 21-35 cm.; others, average 25 cm., extremes 10-30 cm. Thickness of wall: average 8 mm. Decoration. See under Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety. In the majority of cases, the white fired zone extends on both sides of the rim. Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Ulam phases. This variety reaches its peak of popularity in the late Xuku and Early Tixum phases (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. The question of whether Tehuantepec Black-and-White is the descendant of Guizi Black-and- White or a new type introduced from the outside is open to debate. Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety (Figs. 39-43) Paste. Temper: silty. The temper can hardly be seen with the naked eye. Texture: compact and homo- geneous. Color: light brown to black, occasionally orange. Fracture: straight. Some sherds flake off at the point of fracture; very hard sherds have a conchoidal break. Firing: even, usually reduced, occasionally in- completely oxidized or fully oxidized. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are extremely well polished and have a satiny sheen. The surfaces seem to consist of a flow caused by the polishing. Incom- pletely oxidized sherds have a somewhat waxy feel. Color: all shades of gray; some browns, beiges, and blacks. Form. Shapes: only two shapes have been identified, a tripod dish or vase (tetrapods do occasionally occur) and a bowl. Tripods usually have fairly erect out- curving walls; few have straight flaring walls. Walls: their thickness almost always increases from base to lip. Rims: direct. Lips: flattened or beveled on the inside (9 rim sherds out of 10) (figs. 39; 40a, b, i; 43b, e) ; rounded (figs. 40f-h; 43a, c, d, f) ; bolstered (fig. 39i). Bases: flat. Supports: hollow cylindrical (figs. 40h; 41h, i); hollow conical with flat end (fig. 41j); hollow conical with pointed end (fig. 41k); hollow, elongated and slab-like (fig. 411); solid slab, plain or decorated (figs. 41o; 431); nubbin (figs. 40i; 41p, q); other supports are illustrated in figure 41m, n. Dimensions of tripods. Exterior rim diameter: aver- age 22.5 cm., extremes 15-27 cm. Height: average 9.25 cm., extremes 6-10 cm. Base thickness: average 6 mm. Wall thickness: average 5 mm., extremes 3-9 mm. Decoration of tripods. Techniques: groove incising and painting; stick burnishing (one example only). The paint consists of a thin red wash which rubs off easily. Elements: straight, curved, wavy, zig-zag, and S-shaped lines; hatched triangles; rounded or angular scrolls; half terraces. Incised designs: single or double S-shaped lines, rounded or angular (figs. 39a-c; 40d, e; 41d; 43c); sets of short parallel vertical lines confined between two horizontal lines (figs. 39i, j; 43k); cross- hatching of zones and panels (figs. 41e; 43a, e, f); other designs are shown in figures 41f, 43d, h-j. Painted designs: bands on top of lips, around the bottom, and on the outside of walls; filling of zones and panels. Bowls: All have hemispherical bodies, direct incurv- ing rims, and round lips (fig. 42).</page><page sequence="73">74 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

Color: brown to black. Firing: uneven, often carbonized. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are well polished and attain a fair gloss; they have a somewhat soapy tex- ture. Color: 60 per cent of the sherds are black, the remainder, brownish black. The strong color contrast between the surfaces and the cores suggests that the vessels were smudged after firing. Form. Shapes: dishes or plates with outcurving walls and flat bases account for 77 per cent of the total number of identified shapes (fig. 45e, i, f'); tecomates (fig. 45a, c); bowls ( ?) (fig. 45e', o') ; vases or dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 45f-h, 1); dishes with recurved walls (fig. 45d, h'); jars with or without cylindrical necks (fig. 45j, z, j'); jars with insloping</page><page sequence="79">80 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

This variety reaches its peak of popularity in the early Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. The sherds from Lieza are evenly black in color; those from Boca del Rio are usually blackish brown. Morro Black: Guiengola Variety (Fig. 45m-v, x, y, a'-d', k'-n') This variety is extremely rare and consists of a hand- ful of decorated sherds. It does not differ from the Morro Variety in paste, surface, or vessel shapes. The decorative techniques include: groove, light, and fine incising; fluting (fig. 45s-u); notching of basal breaks and lips (fig. 45p, v, b'); facetting of basal breaks (fig. 45k'); ribbing (fig. 45n'); chamfering (fig. 45d'). Decorative elements consist of straight, scalloped, or wavy lines, and scrolls. The designs are very simple arrangements of parallel lines usually on the rims (fig. 45mr, o, s, a', b', k'); more complex arrangements are shown in figure 45q and r. The Guiengola Variety is essentially a Classic variety and has been recorded from the Xuku through the Late Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). Dubi Gray: Dubi Variety (Fig. 46a-f, m-q, s-i', o'-v') Paste and surface finish. See under HIuilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety. Form. Shapes: bowls (fig. 46s, a', f', p', t'); teco- mates (fig. 46p-q); dishes with recurved walls (fig. 46b, c, w); composite or S-Z angle bowls (fig. 46z); jars with insloping walls (fig. 46a, o); jars (fig. 46f, s'); dishes or vases with nearly erect walls and slight rim eversion (fig. 46t-v, c', g', h') ; dishes or bowls with straight flaring walls (fig. 46e'). Rims and lips: the number of rim-lip profiles is so great that we shall not describe them. Bases: half are flat, half slightly concave. Supports: ring base (fig. 46r). Appendages: spout (fig. 46o'). Perforation for sus- pension: one sherd (fig. 46v'). Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Ulam phases. This variety is most common in the Late Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). Temporal differences. During the Tixum phase, the number of variations of rim-lip profiles increases markedly. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del REio. Discussion. It seems probable that this variety is related to Radani Gray. Dubi Gray: Chihuitan Variety (Fig. 46g-1; r, j-n') Except for the decoration, this variety is identical to the Dubi Gray Variety. The number of decorated sherds was so small that we hesitated to set up a new variety. The techniques used to decorate this variety consist of fine, groove, light, or blade incising; punctating; fluting, and ribbing occur occasionally. The designs include sets of oblique lines (fig. 46h), combinations of straight and wavy lines (fig. 461, k'), vertical lines be- tween the lip and an encircling line on the outside (fig. 46r), rows of punctations (fig. 46m'), bands of hatched triangles (fig. 46n'), and combinations of scalloped and straight lines (fig. 461'). Several designs and decorative techniques are carried over from the Formative into the Classic, such as blade incising, and the arrangements of straight and wavy lines, and indicate cultural continuity in the area. Loteca Thick: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 47) Paste and surface. See under Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety. Form. Shapes: the most common is the apaxtle or large basin with straight flaring walls (fig. 47e, o, r-t, d', e'); bowls (fig. 47d, g, p, x); dishes with recurved walls (fig. 47h); dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 47f); jars with insloping rims (fig. 47q); jars with cylindrical necks (fig. 47a, b, u, b') ; dishes or plates with everted rims (fig. 47c') ; florero (?) (fig. 47c); composite or S-Z angle bowls (fig. 47z) ; cylindrical vessels (?) (fig. 47i). Rims: usually direct, occasion- ally recurved or everted. Lips: usually rounded. Apax- tles not infrequently have flattened lips (fig. 47o, t); jars with cylindrical necks sometimes have flattened grooved lips (fig. 47a, u). Walls: usually tapering toward either the lip or the base. Bases: flat, occa- sionally concave or convex. Supports: solid conical rounded legs (fig. 47a'). Appendages: strap handles (fig. 47j, b').

A total of 8 sherds are decorated (fig. 47b, i, k-r, p, u, f'), and we feel that their small number does not warrant setting up a new variety or even a new type at this time. The decorative techniques consist of fluting and plain and groove incising. Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Ulam phases (fig. 9). This type is most common in the late Xuku phase. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. The same technological rules were fol- lowed to make this type as for Huilotepec Decorated, Morro Black, or Dubi Gray types; it differs from them in its ruggedness and thickness. Guibixo Thick: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 48) Paste. Temper, texture, and fracture: see under Huilotepec Decorated: Huiltotepec Variety. Color: Apricot Buff to Vinaceous Tawny. Firing: fully oxidized. Surface. Finish: apaxtles have their exterior walls scraped; the remaining vessels are either scraped or wiped. The inside surfaces are always extremely well polished. Color: Apricot Buff to Vinaceous Tawny. Formi. Shapes: apaxtles with straight flaring or very slightly outcurving walls (fig. 48a, c-f, j); bowls (fig. 48b, g) ; trays (fig. 48h-i) ; censers (inferred from a large curved slab foot) (fig. 65j).

Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Tixum phases (fig. 9). This type is very common in the early Tixum sub-phase. Temporal diff erences. This type is of excellent quality in the Xuku phase, and of fair quality in the Tixum phase. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Espinal White-Slipped: Espinal Variety (Fig. 49f, v) Paste. Temper: no temper visible to the naked eye. A few sherds have soft ochraceous inclusions and large quartz particles which measure up to 5 mm. in diameter. Texture: dense, china-like, and extremely hard. The sherds give off a metallic ring when struck. Color: the cores are gray, and the surface layers, off-white or cream. Fracture: fresh breaks are straight with sharp edges. Firing: semi-reduced. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are compacted and evenly smoothed; interior surfaces are often wiped.

Elements: incised elements consist of one or several horizontal lines around the exterior of the vessels (fig. 49s-u); painted elements consist of bands, dots, and hand-bell-shaped figures. Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku through Tixum phases. This variety is extremely rare (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. This variety is one of the finest groups of ceramic found in our excavations. Nichi Fine-Grained: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 50) Paste. Temper: moderate to heavy amount of very fine to fine-grained particles (%c6-1/4 mm.) consisting chiefly of quartz. Texture: dense, sometimes slightly granular or porous. Color: gray, occasionally light buff or cinnamon; thick sherds often have a gray core between two brown or orange layers. Fracture: mod- erately straight; fresh breaks have sharp edges. Fir- ing: evenly reduced to incompletely oxidized. Indi- cations are that the paste could be fired either gray or orange at will or accidentally. b e r pw q * S m~~~~~~ w~~~~~~~~ 5 t cm scale v FIG. 49.

Xuku to Ulam phase inclusive. The peak of popuIlarity is during the Tixum phase (fig. 9). Temporal differences. The large thin-walled basins with brushed interiors are characteristic of the Xuku and Tixum phases and are not found in the Ulam phase. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. Abrasion of the surfaces rendered iden- tification difficult. Nichi Fine-Grained will remain a potential type with unspecified varieties for the time being. Guia Painted: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 51) Paste. Temper: variable amount of silty to very fine aplastic (/256-1/8 mm.) ; there are inclusions of large quartz and ochraceous soft particles. Texture: porous, but nonetheless dense. Color: light gray cores turning into off-white or light buff near the surfaces. Some sherds are light gray throughout with a paper- thin white surface. Fracture: fresh breaks are straight with clean sharp edges. Firing: incompletely oxidized or partly reduced. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are compacted, evenly smoothed, and have an emery cloth tactile feel; when rubbed they leave a powdery film on the fingers; wiped surfaces are not infrequent. Treatment: the surfaces are covered with a flow caused by polishing. Color: off-white to light yellowish. Form. Shapes: tripod dishes with straight flaring or slightly out-curving walls, and with slab, hollow cylindrical, or hollow bulbar legs (fig. 51a, f, u, v, w, y, a'); bowls (fig. 51g); bowls with flaring lips (fig. 51X) ; tecomates (fig. 51c, d) ; plates or dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 51e, i-I, n, t, b') ; jars with cylindrical necks and strap handles (fig. 51s) ; vessels with nearly erect walls (fig. 51o-r); plates or dishes with outcurving walls (fig. 51h, c'); plates with straight flaring walls, everted rims, and rounded bases (fig. 51d') ; strainers (fig. 51b). Rims: direct, occasionally everted. Lips: usually rounded; beveled in tripods; bolstered (fig. 51r). Bases: flat, concave, or convex. Supports: slab legs are the most common; hollow bulbar (fig. 51a') and hollow cylindrical also occur. Appendages: spouts (not illustrated) ; strap handles (fig. 51s). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: tripods, average 23 cm., extremes 16-32 cm.; bowls, average 16.5 cm., extremes 15-19 cm.; tecomates, average 18 cm., ex- tremes 15-21 cm.; strainer in figure 51b is 14.5 cm.

Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku to the Ulam phase inclusive; this type is most popular in the Late Tixum phase or Late Classic (fig. 9). Temporal differences. During the Tixum phase the slip is usually off-white or cream, whereas in the Ulam, it is more yellowish. Plates with straight flaring walls, everted rims, swollen lips, and convex bases appear at the very end of the Tixum phase and indicate the end of the Classic Period or the beginning of the Post- classic Period. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. This variety is one of the few ceramic groups found in greater quantity at Boca del Rio than at Lieza. Discussion. Until better preserved material comes to light, Guia Painted will remain a potential type. Vixahui Medium-Coarse Slipped: Vixahui Variety (Fig. 52) Paste. Temper: moderate to fair amount of unevenly sized particles ranging from fine to medium coarse (1/8-1/4 mm.) ; it contains virtually no mica, but instead, numerous ochraceous soft particles. Texture: porous to fairly compact; lamination occurs. Color: buff or off-white from surface to surface; thick sherds have gray cores. Fracture: straight to irregular. Firing: usually evenly reduced.

Painted elements: usually a red band confined to the lip; sets of angular S-shaped figures (fig. 52a). Filleted elements: the fillets are applied horizontally or vertically (fig. 52u-w). Chronological position and popularity index. It is essentially a Late Classic type with its florescence dur- ing the Tixum phase; it has been recorded from the Xuku to the Ulam phase inclusive (fig. 9). Temporal differences. None observed. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. It is probable that Vixahui Medium- Coarse Slipped has evolved out of Tlacotepec Red-on- Clouded. Sherds with finger impressed fillets may be fragments of censers. Huayabal Leathery: Huayabal Variety (Fig. 53) Paste. Temper: moderate to heavy amount of fine to medium coarse particles (%46-Y2 mm.) consisting chiefly of quartz and mica. Texture: dense to granu- lar; lamination and cracks occur. Color: black cores varying between 50 and 75 per cent of the total thick- ness are sandwiched between or blend into cinnamon- colored superficial layers. Fracture: fairly straight. Firing: incompletely oxidized. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are evenly smoothed and have a strong leathery tactile feel; the high content of mica in the paste makes them glitter. The interior surfaces are evenly scraped and have extensive rough- ened areas. Color: usually cinnamon. Firing clouds occur on the rim only.

The rims shown in figure 53q and r are unique. Bases: convex; a few are flat (fig. 53s, t). Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: jars with con- tinuous curve necks and moderately everted rims, aver- age 19cm.; jars with thick, short, crescent-shaped rims, average 14.5 cm.; jars with recurved rims, average 23 cm.; jars with straight everted rims forming a rounded angle with the body, average 18.5 cm. Wall thickness: average 6.5 mm., extremes 4-10.5 mm. Chronological position and popularity index. This variety is most popular in the Xuku and Tixum phases (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Almost exclusively found at Lieza. Discussion. The vessels display excellent craftsman- ship; their leathery feel may be due to some property of the clay. The virtual absence of this variety from Boca del Rio is unexplainable. Mitiac Domestic: Mitiac Variety (Figs. 54, 55a-m, 56) Paste.

Elements and designs: simple geo- metric arrangements of parallel lines; rows of notches or punctations. Chronological position and popularity index. The Mitiac Variety is the second most numerous ceramic group in our collection found from the Niti to the Ulam phase inclusive (fig. 9). Temporal differences. During the Xuku phase three- fifths of the jars have angular necks, and the remainder have rounded continuous curve necks, while in the Late Tixum sub-phase over ninety per cent of the jars have continuous curve necks. Grater bowls are found only in the Xuku and Tixum phases and do not survive into the Ulam phase; thin-walled grater bowls have been recorded only in the Xuku phase. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Mitiac Domestic: Natar Variety (Fig. 55n-e') Vessels of the Natar Variety are invariably gray fired. The inventory of shapes is limited and does not include the grater bowl. Large thick-walled basins characterize this variety (fig. 55n, u, w-z, b', d'). Ves- sels from the Ulam phase are generally thicker than those from the Xuku or Tixum phases; they are also grayer and contain more temper. Natar Variety has never been popular and occurs mostly during the Late Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). Arrian Slipped: Arrian Variety (Fig. 57a-m) Paste and surface finish. See under Tlacotepec Red- on-Clouded. Surface treatment: slipped and polished to a fair gloss. Color: Salmon Buff, Japan Rose, Wood Brown. Form. Shapes: jars with vertical necks and rims (fig. 57b-d); continuous curve neck jars (fig. 57a); jars with insloping walls and rims (fig. 57e); dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 57i, k, 1); dishes with outcurving walls (fig. 57g, h) ; bowls (fig. 57j).

Chronological position and popularity index. Late Xuku phase to the Ulam phase inclusive. This variety has never been common (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Guivechi Red-Slipped: Guivechi Variety (Fig. 57n-r) Paste. Temper: see under Tlacotepec Red-on- Clouded. Texture: extremely friable. Color: about half of the sherds are cinnamon-orange from surface to surface, and half have a black core blending into brown and then into cinnamon-orange. Firing: oxi- dized or incompletely oxidized. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are usually well smoothed. Treatment: slipped. It seems that only the upper part of jars is slipped, the slip extending down to a point several centimeters below the maximum width of the bodies. The slip is soft and abrades easily. Color of the slip: Corinthian Red and Pompeian Red. Form. Shape: jars with flat, outcurving, or rounded rims (fig. 57n-r) forming a well-defined angle with the body walls; continuous curve neck jars occur. Rims: usually taper from neck to lip. Lips: rounded. Walls: globular or biconical. Bases: convex. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 31.5 cm., extremes 21-34.5 cm. Width of rims: average 6 cm., extremes 3.7-8.2 cm. Wall thickness: average 8 mm., extremes 4.5-11.5 mm. Chronological position and popularity index. Xuku to Tixum phases. Its popularity reaches its peak dur- ing the Tixum phase (fig. 9). Temporal differences. As time elapses the rims of jars grow narrower and the red slip, usually bright, turns into darker shades. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. This variety is the direct descendant of Zuleta Red-Slipped and is easily identified only toward the close of the Tixum phase. Lieza Self-Slipped: Lieza Variety (Fig. 15e-i, k, 1) This variety lingers on into the Xuku phase from the Niti phase. The only distinctively new profile is illustrated in figure 15g. The remaining profiles illus- trated are variations of the basic shapes recorded in previous cultural phases. Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi and Pixana Varieties (Fig. 23p-r) During the Xuku phase these two varieties lose their identity as a result of becoming absorbed by or coal- escing with Tehuantepec Black-and-White. The most common vessels are still bowls. Profiles shown in figure 23p-r are new. Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 26o-z, c') From the Xuku phase on, this type gradually evolves into Dubi Gray: Dubi Variety. The profiles and de- signs which characterize this variety during this phase are shown in figure 26o-z, c'. Thin-lipped vessels are common (fig. 26v, y). Blade incising is also carried over into the Xuku phase (fig. 26o, q). The scroll motive (fig. 26p) and the S-shaped figure (fig. 26r), typical of the Classic Period, are new decorative ele- ments. Bases are usually thinner and more often con- cave than flat. Generally speaking, vessels of this phase are larger and the walls are thicker than in the preceding Niti phase. Zuleta Red-Slipped: Varieties Unspecified This type carries over into the Xuku phase from the Niti phase without any noticeable changes. MISCELLANEOUS Five lots of sherds with no definite typological status were grouped under this heading. Fine-Grained Slipped-Painted (Fig. 63a-c) Corpus. Eight sherds. Paste.

From the Xuku to the Ulam phase inclusive (tables 1, 3). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. This ceramic group is a mixture includ- ing sherds which seem to represent the slipped version of Dubi Gray: Dubi Variety. The red wash is iden- tical to that used to paint the Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety vessels. Several sherds are red- slipped on one side and white-slipped on the other. THE TIXUM PHASE The Tixum phase is subdivided into two sub-phases, Early and Late Tixum. The Early Tixum sub-phase is essentially a transitional phase between the Xuku and the Late Tixum sub-phase, and reflects a strong ceramic relapse, whereas the Late Tixum sub-phase typifies a period of intense ceramic activity and creativity. THE EARLY TIXUM SUB-PHASE The superb skill used to make such vessels as Tlaco- tepec Red-on-Clouded, Huilotepec Decorated, or Espi- nal White-Slipped, has now given way to careless</page><page sequence="95">96 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

In particular, designs in- cised on Huilotepec Decorated tripod dishes are truly decadent. The two major changes of the Early Tixum sub- phase concern the pastes and the surfaces. The pastes become coarser and slightly softer, and the surfaces tend to abrade readily. It is probable that the potters used new sand and clay pits. Almost all types of the Early Tixum sub-phase con- tinue from the preceding Xuku phase. The only newly defined type is Niza Polished. Three new ceramic groups with no typological status are Soft-Glossy- Flaky, Negative-Painted, and Fine-Grained Black-and- White. The latter was decorated by means of firing, one of the most firmly established decorative techniques of the area. Among the innovations which are of rare occurrence during the Early Tixum sub-phase, and which become common during the Late Tixum sub-phase, we re- corded: strainers or colanders, jars with long cylindri- cal necks and strap-handles, mammiform hollow sup- ports, bowls and dishes with roughened outside walls, potstands, spiked censers, and negative painting. Niza Polished: Niza Variety (Fig. 58a-w) Paste and Surface. See under Ixtal Old-Ivory: Ixtal Variety. Form. Shapes: bowls (fig. 58e, g, n, w); dishes with recurved walls (fig. 58m); dishes with outcurving walls (fig. 58f); dishes with straight flaring walls (fig. 58h); tripod dishes (fig. 58u, v); cylindrical vases ( ?) (fig. 58i); composite or S-Z angle bowls (fig. 58b); strainers (fig. 58k, s, t) ; jars (fig. 58j). Rims: usually direct, often everted, and nearly always widening to- ward the lips. Lips: rounded, tapered, flattened, or swollen. Bases: flat, occasionally convex. Appen- dages: spout (fig. 58c). Supports: hollow legs: bulbous (fig. 58v) and conical. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: bowls, average 14.5 cm., extremes 10-19 cm.; dishes with recurved walls, one specimen measurable, 23 cm.; cylindrical vase ( ?), 19 cm. Wall thickness: average 4 mm., extremes 2.5-7 mm. Decoration. Techniques: painting combined with plain incising (fig. 58b), groove incising (fig. 58i), or fine incising (fig. 58r). Elements: single or double incised lines around the exterior of bowls; solid red painted bands applied on the lips or rims; straight, wavy lines; scrolls (fig. 58b) ; semicircles. Designs: they consist of simple arrangements of these elements. Chronological position and popularity index. Sherds were found in dribs and drabs in the Tixum and Ulam phases (fig. 9). Temporal differences. Small conical hollow legs and strainers are characteristic of the Late Tixum sub-phase and the Ulam phase. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. The designs and the small bowls are not quite at home in the western Pacific Plains; it is our impression that these vessels have been traded in the region. Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 27a-f) New vessel profiles which are characteristic of this phase are illustrated in figure 27a-f. Zuleta Red-Slipped: Varieties Unspecified In this phase the quality deteriorates rapidly. The slips are darker. Almost all jars have rims forming a well-defined angle with the body walls; the angle is often acute. Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded: Tlacotepec Variety (Fig. 38h-m) This type is a continuation from the preceding Xuku phase. The number of vessels with grooved rims diminishes substantially. Firing clouds are of smaller extent. Although there is a slow deterioration in craftsmanship, there is no noticeable change in basic shapes or decoration. This variety becomes extinct at the end of this phase. Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety (Fig. 41m, n, p, q; 42o; 43) This type continues from the Xuku phase into the Tixum phase with some slight changes in temper and surface finish. The temper, though still silty, becomes visible to the naked eye. Beige and light brown sherds are more common. Bowls become smaller; they aver- age 16 cm. in diameter, compared to 18.5 cm. in the Xuku phase. Line decoration is more carelessly done. Crosshatching of zones is a frequently used decorative technique (fig. 43e, f, i). Variations recorded in this phase are: carved slab foot (fig. 431) ; hollow open foot (fig. 41m); and mammiform foot (fig. 41n). Cheguigo Decorated: Cheguigo Variety (Fig. 44e, f) Cheguigo Decorated: Cheguigo Variety carries over into the Tixum phase from the Xuku phase without any apparent change in paste or in surface finish. One basal sherd with annular support was recorded in our excavations (fig. 44f). Morro Black: Morro Variety (Fig. 45z, e'-g') This variety continues from the Xuku phase into the Early Tixum sub-phase with some slight changes. The paste becomes coarser, the designs are not as neat as</page><page sequence="97">98 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in the Xuku phase, and the quality in general de- -teriorates. Dubi Gray: Dubi Variety (Fig. 46d-f, m, n) This variety carries over into the Early Tixum sub- phase from the Xuku phase without any changes in paste or surface finish. The number of profiles of vessels increases substantially. Dubi Gray: Chihuitan Variety (Fig. 46g-1) This variety continues into the Early Tixum sub- phase from the Xuku phase without any changes. Loteca Thick: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 47o-e') The main variations observed in this phase are: the color range is much wider, there are several sherds which have nearly black surfaces, the paste contains a larger amount of tempering material, apaxtles become prominent, and jars with cylindrical necks become slightly more common. Guibixo Thick: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 48g, j) This type carries over into the Tixum phase without any changes in paste or surface finish. Trays are no longer present. The sherd illustrated in figure 64m seems to be a fragment of a large censer. Ixtal Old-Ivory: Ixtal Variety (Fig. 49d) This type carries over from the preceding Xuku phase without any noticeable change, and becomes extinct at the end of this phase. The surfaces are less glossy. Nichi Fine-Grained: Varieties Unspecified (Fig. 50a-d, f-i) This type carries over from the Xuku into the Tixum phase with some minor variations. The number of oxidized sherds is increasing toward the end of this phase. At Lieza, over 80 per cent of the vessels have brushed interior surfaces; this percentage drops dras- tically at the very end of this phase. This type is essentially a Late Classic type. Mitiac Domestic: Mitiac Variety (Figs. 54f-p; 55a-m; 56e-j') Thin-walled bowls have now completely disappeared. Jars with fillets and lugs are more common. Almost all jars have continuous curve necks. The variations of the rim profiles are much greater. Vessels with long solid legs, strainers, and low rounded plates are innovations which appear at the close of this phase. Dishes with roughened surfaces (fig. 56h, i) die out in this phase. Mitiac Domestic: Natar Variety (Fig. 55q-e') This variety continues into the Tixum phase without any change in paste or surface finish. It seems probable that the jars with cylindrical necks, with or without loop handles, are innovations (fig. 55d, e). MISCELLANEOUS Two highly distinctive units which could not be raised to the status of type, which we grouped in this section, are Fine-Grained Black-and-White and Soft- Glossy-Flaky. Fine-Grained Black-and-White (Fig. 63i, j) Corpus. Four sherds. Paste. Temper: abundant very fine-grained (1%6 1/8 mm.), containing a high proportion of muscovite. There are some few inclusions of large quartz particles. Texture: dense; slightly laminated. Color: gray to brownish-gray throughout. Fracture: straight. Fir- ing: reduced to incompletely carbonized. Surface. Finish: smooth and even. Color: black to dark grayish-black. The surfaces glitter with the mus- covite particles. Form. Shape: dishes or basins (fig. 63i, j). Rims: direct. Lips: rounded. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 33 cm. Wall thickness: average 10 mm. Decoration. See under Guizi Black-and-White: Guizi Variety. Chronological position. Early Tixum sub-phase (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio only. Soft-Glossy-Flaky (Fig. 63r, s) Corpus. Three sherds. Paste. Temper: stray lumps of what appear to be hematite. Texture: the surface layers are soft and flaky; the cores are hard. Color: gray or dark gray cores blending into Orange Pink. Fracture: irregular; the sherds flake at the fracture point. Firing: incom- pletely oxidized. Surface. Finish: both surfaces are evenly smoothed and polished. Treatment: the surfaces may be covered with a thin film of flow which was caused by the polishing, and which is a shade darker than the paste; they have an extremely soft velvety tactile feel. Color of flow: Orange Pink.</page><page sequence="98">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE POTTERY 99 Form. Shape: bowls (fig. 63r, s). Lips: rounded. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 13 cm. Wall thickness: average 5 mm. Decoration. Techniques: incising and painting. Elements and designs: the rim illustrated in figure 63s has an incised line encircling the rim, and some sort of curvilinear design on the exterior wall; in figure 63r the decoration consists of a red band applied on the exterior rim. Chronological position. Early and Late Tixum sub- phases (tables 1 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Discussion. The pink color of the paste seems to have resulted from mixing hematite with the base clay. Negative-Painted (Fig. 63b') Corpus. One sherd. Paste and surface finish. See under Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety. Surface treatment: the interior surface is probably coated with a thin transparent slip. Form. Shape: bowl with a flattened lip. Decoration. Technique: negative painting. Ele- ments and design: repeated S-shaped figures on the exterior rim. The nature of the design on the body cannot be determined. The design is cream on a brownish-black background. Chronological position. Early Tixum sub-phase (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza. THE LATE TIXUM SUB-PHASE The types and varieties of the Xuku and the Early Tixum sub-phase continue into the Late Tixum sub- phase. New types and varieties which are added to the ceramic complex of this phase are: Ixtepec Slipped- Incised: Ixtepec Variety, whose designs are gouged- incised; Pearson Negative-Painted: Pearson Variety; and Juchitan Shell-Raked: Juchitan Variety, which consists of large vases with coarse-grained paste and shell-raked exterior surfaces. Plumbate ware is repre- sented by one small sherd. Several unspecified ceramic units have been relegated to the Miscellaneous group, such as White-Slipped on Cinnamon, characterized by a very thick white slip. The Late Tixum sub-phase is also marked by the appearance of significant innovations: tripods with thin, broad slab legs; vessels with swollen lips; possibly mold-made vessels; and unevenly grained pastes con- taining very large quartz inclusions, up to 5 mm. in diameter, which prevented the surface from being evenly smoothed. Pale yellowish slips are more com- mon than white or off-white slips, and brownish-red slips are more common than red slips. Decorative ele- ments which are typical of this sub-phase are solid semi- circles painted on rims and bands containing rows of dots. Strainers and bowls or dishes with roughened exterior surfaces, which were rare in the Early Tixum sub-phase, become increasingly important in the Late Tixum sub-phase. At the very end of this sub-phase a new shape of plate appears, the plate with outcurving or straight flaring walls terminating in a swollen lip, and with a convex base. The Dubi Gray: Dubi Variety exhibits the same evolutionary spurt during the Late Tixum sub-phase as that shown by Radani Gray during the Kuak phase, which resulted in an increase in the number of varia- tions of lip-rim profiles. Ixtepec Slipped-Incised: Ixtepec Variety (Fig. 58x-c') Paste. See under Espinal White-Slipped: Espinal Variety. Surface. Finish: the exterior walls are carefully smoothed; the interiors are wiped. Treatment: red- slipped. The slip is dull to shiny. Color of slip: Brick Red, Acajou Red, and Sanford's Brown. Form. Shape: the sherds suggest globular jars. Dimensions. Wall thickness: average 4 mm. Decoration. Technique: post-firing gouged and plain incised, cutting through the slip into the paste. The designs stand out in white against the red background. Elements: gouged out white areas; curved, straight, and wavy lines; U-shaped figures. Designs: complex designs seem to be the rule. Chronological position and popularity index. Late Tixum sub-phase. This variety is extremely rare (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza only. Pearson Negative-Painted: Pearson Variety (Fig. 58d'-i') Paste. See under Espinal White-Slipped: Espinal Variety. Surface. Finish: though the surfaces are badly eroded, it seems that they were well smoothed. Treat- ment: it is not impossible that the surfaces were coated with a thin transparent slip after having been decorated. Form. Shape: small bowls with tapering or widen- ing rims. Decoration. Technique: negative painting and paint- ing. Elements: straight and curved lines, dots, star- like figures. Designs: curved and straight bands con- taining rows of dots (fig. 58d', e', g', i'); combinations of straight and curved lines (fig. 58h'). Either surface or both surfaces may be negative painted. The rims are usually painted red. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase only (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio.</page><page sequence="99">100 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Juchitan Shell-Raked: Juchitan Variety (Fig. 63y-a') Paste. Temper: fair amount of unevenly sized par- ticles and many quartz particles measuring up to 3 mm. in diameter. Mica is almost entirely absent. Texture: compact, dense, and hard. Color: usually Salmon or cinnamon. Fracture: irregular. Firing: unevenly oxidized. Surface. Finish: the surfaces are unevenly smoothed, with the result that there are great variations in the thickness of the walls. The large quartz particles pro- trude on the surfaces. Treatment: the surfaces were raked with the serrated edge of a shell. Sometimes limited areas were partially polished, which almost obliterated the raking troughs. Color: Pink Cinnamon, Orange Red, Salmon, cream, drab. Firing clouds occur. Form. Shape: tall large vase with vertically set walls with slightly concave sides. The edge of the rim is slightly turned outward, and terminates in a rounded lip; the rims are usually thinner than the walls. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 29 cm. Height: estimated to be between 18 and 20 cm. Wall thickness: average 9 mm. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase (fig. 9). This variety appears as suddenly as it disappears. Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. MISCELLANEOUS CERAMIC UNITS OF THE LATE TIXUM SUB-PHASE Except Plumbate Ware, the ceramic units discussed below are unspecified and have no typological status. White-Slip on Cinnamon-Paste (Fig. 63m-q) Corpus. Seven sherds. Paste. See under Jordan Self-Slipped: Jordan Variety. Surface. Finish: under the slip the surfaces are evenly smoothed and well compacted. Treatment: white-slipped. The slip is thick and polished. Color of slip: white, off-white. Form. Shapes: jars with insloping, slightly curved walls (fig. 63m); bowls (fig. 63p); bowls with everted rims (fig. 63n, o). Rims: direct or everted. Lips: rounded. Bases: flat. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: the jar in figure 63n is 12 cm.; the bowl in figure 63p is 17 cm.; bowls with everted rims, average 16 cm., extremes 15-24 cm. Chronological position. From the Late Tixum sub- phase to the Ulam phase inclusive (tables 1 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Salmon Light-Porous (Fig. 63t-x) Corpus. Thirty-six sherds. Paste.

Shapes: jars with long curved necks joining the walls at a well-defined angle (fig. 63v, x); dishes with outcurving walls and rounded bases (fig. 63t); bowls (fig. 63u). Bases: flat or convex. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: jars, average 14 cm.; dishes, average 22 cm.; bowls, average 25 cm. Wall thickness: average 5.5 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting with brown color. Elements and design: narrow band of paint confined to the lips of bowls; vertical lines on the outside of necks of jars, and bands around the neck-wall junction of jars. Several sherds indicate that the bodies were also painted. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase through Ulam phase (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza. Thick White-Slipped (Fig. 63k) Corpus. Four sherds. Paste. See under Huayabal Leathery: Huayabal Variety. Surface. Finish: the surfaces were probably scraped or smoothed with a broad-bladed smoothing tool.

Wall thickness: 16 mm. Chronological position. From the Late Tixum sub- phase through the Ulam phase (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. Plumbate Ware One small fragment was found in a Late Tixum level, in Stratigraphic Pit B2 at Boca del Rio. THE ULAM PHASE The Ulam phase which embraces the whole Post- classic Period is poorly defined. Three ceramic types</page><page sequence="100">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] THE POTTERY 101 are dominant: Reu Silty, Jordan Self-Slipped, and Totolnico Heavy-Coarse. Reu Silty is affiliated with the Mixteca-Puebla culture. Jordan Self-Slipped is distinguishable by its color. Totolnico Heavy-Coarse is a crude slipped household ware. Sherds of the latter three types have been found sporadically in levels of the Tixum phase. Ya Red-Slipped and Visendi Yellow- Slipped are two minor new ceramic units. The typical shapes of this phase are: plates with rounded bases and slightly outcurving walls terminating in swollen lips, low rounded plates, vessels supported by zoomorphic legs, jars with short, nearly erect rims forming a wide angle with the body walls, and possibly tri-prong censers. The ceramic complex of this phase is further charac- terized by unevenly grained pastes, small incised tabs on the shoulders of jars, and a large number of oxidized vessels. a k e T k m _ _ _ ~ ~ _ 0 r O 5 10 0 5 cm scale Z cm scale FIG. 59.

Ya Red-Slipped: Ya Variety (Fig. 59a-e) Paste and surface finish. See under Espinal White- Slipped: Espinal Variety. Color of slip: Corinthian Red and Pompeian Red. Form. Shape: dish with outcurving walls, slightly everted rims, and usually swollen lips. Walls: widen- ing from base to lip. Bases: flat to convex. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: average 24 cm., extremes 22-26 cm. Height: average 5.5 cm. Wall thickness: average 5.5 mm. Decoration. Technique: painting in black and/or white. Elements and designs: broad straight and curved lines; scrolls. The red paint is made of specular hematite. Chronological position. Although a few sherds of this variety were found in the Tixum phase, this variety is essentially a Postclassic ceramic manifestation (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Visendi Yellow-Slipped: Visendi Variety (Fig. 59f-z) Paste and surface finish. See under Espinal White- Slipped. The paste of Visendi Yellow-Slipped differs slightly from that of the Espinal White-Slipped in that it contains a larger proportion of large quartz inclu- sions. Color of slip: Maize Yellow and Naples Yellow. The slips are thin and tend to wear off easily. Form. Shapes: dishes with outcurving walls, slightly convex bases, and swollen lips (fig. 59h, o, p, q, z); bowls (fig. 59i, 1, r, s) ; composite bowls (fig. 59j, v, k) ; bowls or dishes (fig. 59f, g, m, n) ; jars (fig. 59t, u). Rims: usually everted. Lips: rounded, usually swollen. Bases: flat to convex. Dimensions. Exterior rim diameter: dishes with out- curving walls, average 21 cm., extremes 20-22 cm.; bowls, average 15.5 cm., extremes 15-23 cm.; com- posite bowls (one example), 20 cm.; jars, average 25 cm., extremes 19-27 cm. Decoration. Techniques: painting, ribbing, and in- cising. Elements and designs: red bands confined to lips and rims. Chronological Position. Ulam phase (fig. 9). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. Discussion. This variety seems to be a crude imita- tion of Ya Red-Slipped. Jordan Self-Slipped: Jordan Variety (Fig. 60) Paste. Temper: little to large amount of very fine quartz and mica particles. Texture: dense. Thick sherds have cracks in cores. Color: Apricot Buff, Onion Skin Pink, or Orange Cinnamon from surface to surface. Thick sherds have cores verging on gray or grayish-brown. Fracture: fairly straight. Firitig: usually oxidized. Surface. Finish: under the slip the surfaces are compact and evenly smoothed. Treatment: self-slipped. The slip consists of the same clay as that used for the paste; it has a soft chalky tactile feel as has the paste. The slip seems to have been applied wheni in a thick semi-fluid state, and was then given considerable polish. Color of slip: darker and redder than the paste. Form. Shapes: dishes with recurved walls (fig. 60h); bowls (fig. 60d-f, t-v); jars with short straight everted rims (fig. 60a, x, y); dishes with outcurving walls (fig. 60i, j); tecomates (fig. 60b, c) ; strainers (fig. 60n, d'); tripod dishes are suggested by sherds in figure 60k, p, q, r, f'; other profiles are illustrated in figure 60z-c'. Rims: direct; everted. Lips: rounded; swollen. Bases: flat; convex.

Huilotepec Decorated bowls associated with Burial No. 4, Pit Bi, Boca del Rio. collection censers are suggested mainly by handles, usually hollow tubes, by slightly curved and tapered spoutlike slabs, and by perforated or spiked bowl sherds. Three types of censers have been identified, the bowl and handle type, the censer with prongs on the rim, and the large spiked censer. The large slab leg in figure 65j suggests a fourth type. Bowl and handle type (fig. 65a-e, g, and possibly h; tables 1-3). The bowls have irregular profiles, and their exterior surfaces show a high degree of uneven- ness caused by crude scraping. The majority of the bowls have swollen and red-painted lips; their inside surfaces are self-slipped and wiped. The bowls are pierced; there are usually only a few holes. Prior to piercing the holes, pellets of clay were applied on the outside of the wet walls, and then the holes were punched through both the walls and the pellets. The bowls average 13 cm. in rim diameter, extremes 11-15 cm. The bowl in figure 65e measures 9 cm. in diameter. Three-pronged censer (fig. 65f; table 1). This type is represented by a small fragment. A red-painted band was applied to the lip. Large spiked censers (fig. 65i; tables 1, 2). Their paste is the coarsest yet encountered in our excavations. The temper consists of angular quartz particles up to 7 mm. in diameter. The surfaces have a thin creamy slip made of the same clay as that used for the paste, and have a pinkish cinnamon color. The censers con- sist of large vases with incurving sides, and exterior surfaces are studded with finger-shaped conical spikes. Two such censers are represented in our collection; the larger measures 34 cm. in diameter, the smaller, 24 cm. Their height is estimated at 18-20 cm. The walls average 9 mm. in thickness. The large slab leg illustrated in figure 65j seems to belong to a tall censer. Its outer surface is red-slipped. In paste and surface finish it is identical to that of the Guibixo Thick: Varieties Unspecified. Effigy Vessels or Masks (Fig. 65k-r) Three fragments of effigy vessels or masks were found in our excavations and one on the surface. In paste and surface finish they are identical to vessels of the Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety. The exterior surfaces are polished; the interior ones are wiped and finger patted. The fragments represent the ear region. Two ears have a perforation in the helix in addition to one in the lobe. The sherd in figure 65k is decorated with incised lines and punched-incised cuts. The sherds were recovered in Xuku and Tixum levels (tables 1-3). Funerary Ware (Fig. 66a-c) Votive offerings placed with the dead were scarce. The plate shown in figure 66a, found in Burial No. 5, Stratigraphic Pit B1, at Boca del Rio, belongs to the Tehuantepec Black-and-White: Tehuantepec Variety; it measures 36 cm. in diameter and 6.3 cm. in height. Groups of three low knobs (lugs?) were applied on the exterior wall.</page><page sequence="109">110 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The two bowls illustrated in figure 66b and c are of the Huilotepec Decorated: Huilotepec Variety. The larger one has a diameter of 18 cm. and a height of 9.8 cm. The smaller one is 12.8 cm. in diameter and 5.8 cm. in height. FIGURINES The following typology and descriptions of figurines apply chiefly to specimens from the region between Tehuantepec and Salina Cruz. To present as complete a series as possible, we included some figurines from beyond the limits of the area under consideration, but from the western Pacific Plains. Only those figurines which could unambiguously be established as being affiliated with the types identified were included. The corpus consisted of seventy-two complete figurines and fragments recovered in our excavations and a collection of eighty-two complete figurines and fragments at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. We confined our study of figurines to those of the Tehuantepec-Salina Cruz area in order to avoid possible duplication and probable conflict with a forthcoming report by Delgado on the archaeology of the Juchitian area. We identified twenty types for the Tehuan- tepec area. In our analysis we were inspired by and used an unpublished work by Frances Eyman (1953?). This manuscript marks the first attempt at a methodological classification of a series of figurines from the Juchitfan- Mixtequilla-Tehuantepec area. Since then, our knowl- edge of figurines, through additional acquisitions and through the 1960 excavations which revealed the exist- ence of many new types, has been so broadened that a revision of Eyman's original classification has become imperative. Our data concerning figurines are far from satis- factory. Accurate generalization was difficult because each type identified is represented only by a moderate number of examples, and also because we found it necessary to draw heavily on surface finds. Moreover, the 1960 excavations yielded few figurines. Several types are anchored down to one stratigraphic level, consequently to only one cultural phase, by a single specimen, so that neither their appearance nor the time during which they were made can be determined. These types are, so to speak, floating. The classification of figurines into acceptable types and the interpretation of their cultural and cross-cultural significance is a challenging task. They are rich sources of information and as cultural elements, are just as complex as pots. The figurines were sorted into types which were described on the basis of their culturally significant attributes. Because of the small number of figurines, our classification is consciously analytical, and only to a moderate degree taxonomical. Figurines provide a good opportunity to study the "ethnographic past" of the people they represent. "We come face to face with the men and women folk who otherwise remain such shadowy characters behind their potsherds and ruins from which we reconstruct their history" (Piggott, 1950: p. 109). Figurines also in- volve the determination of a functional aspect with regard to their use. They may be the product of hieratic art to be used in connection with a specific religious activity; they may be votive offerings in burials; they may be penates and lares that were the main constituents of household shrines. They may have been worn as pendants, they may decorate the lids or necks of pots, or they may represent the personifica- tion of a god. Unfortunately, despite these speculations, they more often remain archaeological imponderables. There is one path which the archaeologist fears to tread, the one that leads to aesthetic evaluation of fig- urines. In the present study, aesthetic values are not discussed, although aesthetic appearance will be con- sidered, because it is difficult to judge them according to the canons of beauty of the prehistoric artists. During the past decades the classification of figurines seems to have suffered a setback primarily because in- vestigators restricted their study chiefly to style, some- times to manufacturing techniques. Undoubtedly, manufacturing techniques afford a valuable criterion for classification which has consistently and sometimes successfully been used. Figurines, culturally speaking, are highly complex. It has been pointed out that complex artifacts cannot be classified in terms of all their modes, but they can be classified in terms of their diagnostic attributes (Rouse, 1960: p. 316). Figurines often offer more diagnostic attributes than can be successfully handled. Because of the complex nature of figurines, we believe that the basis for their classification should not be limited to one specific element, but should include attributes se- lected from among the following criteria: (1) paste and surface finish; (2) manufacturing technique; (3) aesthetic appearance; (4) stylistic rendering of anatomi- cal features; (5) ornaments and clothing; (6) customs; (7) dimensions. Each of these criteria will not neces- sarily always reveal diagnostic or culturally significant features, but an attempt should be made to detect whether or not there are any such features. We now turn briefly to each of these typological criteria which serve as a framework for the typology and discussion of the figurines of the Tehuantepec- Salina Cruz area. Paste and surface finish. The paste used to fashion the figurines has, whenever possible, been identified because it affords a valuable criterion for classification. In excavations figurines are associated with ceramics. Frequently both figurines and pots have the same paste and surface finish or pass through similar evolutionary changes. A figurine found on the surface can occasion- ally be assigned to a cultural phase solely on the basis of its paste and surface finish.</page><page sequence="110">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 FIGURINES 111 Manufacturing technique. The method of making figurines should refer, whenever possible, first to the whole figurine, then to its component parts. Classifica- tions of types such as mold-made or hollow figurines are untenable unless we specify the meaning of these terms. Types, by definition, cannot be based on a single attri- bute. Moreover, any part of a figurine can be hand- or nmold-made, incised (toes, digits), punctated (iris of the eye), put into relief by carving the background away (sculpturing of the nose), hollow or solid, con- sist of one or several pieces. Technologically, we can establish four basic types of figurines: a. The monoceramic figurine. This is a figurine with the head, body, and limbs all fashioned from a single lump of clay and at one session. Occasionally ornaments may be added by filleting, or a few anatomi- cal features represented by incising or punctating. Monoceramic figurines can be made either by hanid iodeling, in which case a lump of clay is worked into shape with the fingers and perhaps a tool (details may be added by incising or punctating), or by mold casting, in which a mass of clay is pressed into a hollow mold. If the latter method is used, details may also be added by means of limited filleting, incising, or punctation. Molds used in mold casting can be subdivided into negative molds and positive molds. A negative mold is made from an original hand-modeled figurine or prototype (a mold-made figurine could also be used); the prototype is fired, and a mold taken from it which is also fired in turn; replicas of the prototype are then cast in the mold. Positive molds do not require a prototype. Instead, the features to be represented are directly incised or gouge-incised, sometimes carved, into the surface of the mold. Casts of such molds are usually thin, slablike, and small; the features repro- duced are often mere linear drawings formed by the embossed lines, even in width and in height. Several varieties and types of the so-called "Mazapan" figurines were probably made in this manner. Facial expression of such figurines is usually crude, rigid, and sketchy (fig. 73e, g). b. The compounded figurine. This is a figurine built piecemeal, by means of wads, rods, pellets, and fillets of clay. Body and facial features are welded to each other and worked into the desired shape. Details may be supplemented by incising or punctating. This is the most common way to fashion figurines. The core-and- cover technique is a derivative specialization of this method. A lump of clay, sketchily fashioned into the desired shape, is covered with a layer of clay, which in turn is modeled into features. These figurines are then finished by filleting, incising, or punctating. c. The prefabricated figurine. This type of figurine is assembled from unfinished parts, each of which may have been hand- or mold-made. In other words, the parts of the body are shaped and finished before they are joined to each other. There are two kinds of pre- fabricated figurines: the prefiring prefabricated figu- rines, which usually have stiff conventionalized pos- tures, such as the figurines of the Smiling Complex of Veracruz, which have their parts joined by means of tubes of clay that reinforce the junctures. They were fired after these were in place. The second kind is the articulated figurine or post-firing prefabricated figurine, the component parts of which are shaped and fired before being joined. Parts are held together by means of strings passing through holes provided in the trunk, limbs, and head. d. The sculptured figurine. This is a hypothetical classification. The technique would involve the re- moval of superfluous clay by carving, cutting, or paring off. Features are put into relief by cutting away the background as is done in stone sculpture. Aesthetic appearance. This is an important criterion for assessing and discussing the types of figurines and their form relationships or styles. It deals with the total effect produced by the figurine, irrespective of whether such effect creates a favorable or unfavorable impression, or whether the figurine approaches our aesthetic ideals. Here we are interested in knowing whether figurines are modeled in the round or in low relief, whether they are shown in a relaxed and poised posture such as some Olmec figurines from Tlatilco, or are stiff and ungainly like the Mazapan figurines. The relation of one part to the total body should also be discussed because it also offers clues to the classification and tracing of evolutionary trends in style. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. This title is somewhat clumsy. Features are assessed and dis- cussed as discrete entities. Close attention should be paid to exact treatment of features, technologically and stylistically. Style is an important constituent of cul- ture. "For the archaeologist, style is exemplified in a motive or pattern, or in some directly grasped quality of the work of art, which helps him to localize and date the work and to establish connections between groups of work or between cultures" (Schapiro, 1953: p. 287). Dimensions. Figurines are not immune to poly- morphism, and often those belonging to the same type are made large and hollow or small and solid, or may fall within a narrow range of sizes. Ornaments and clothing. The appearance of special garments, jewelry, or ornaments on a figurine may be a decisive factor in establishing a type or for dating purposes. Fashion of the day, uniforms of ball players, or the use of false beards can be studied and used for cross-cultural comparisons. Customs. Behavioral regularities can be studied on figurines. Artificial head deformation, mutilation of teeth, or the hetzmek method of carrying children among the Maya Indians are some customs which are reflected on the figurines as soon as these practices become established. The collection of figurines under consideration was</page><page sequence="111">112 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. subdivided into three groups. The first group consists of those types, the chronological positions of which, were determined with a moderate to fair degree of accuracy. This group consists mainly of figurines found in situ in our excavations, and which are an- chored down to at least one cultural phase. The time range for each type cannot usually be established. Types consisting of surface finds which cannot be linked with stratigraphic levels through excavation finds are included in the second group. Most of these second types display attributes which can be related to those of types in the first group or to a specific cultural phase. The third group is formed by isolated and aberrant types and trade pieces, undetermined frag- ments, and zoomorphic figurines. Their affiliation with any of the established types of the first group or to any cultural phase is uncertain or unproven. Several may represent new types. The figurines are discussed in the chronological order of their appearance. GROUP 1 THE GOMA PHASE Figurines are rare in Goma deposits. The frag- mentary material was grouped in two types, one repre- sented by figurines with large shocks of hair, and one by figurines with prominent jutting chins. The artists, availing themselves of the same pastes as those used to make pots and plaster house walls, attempted to achieve a more or less three-dimensional representation of the human body. However, they did not attain exact anatomical relationships. Heads, for instance, seem to account for about one-third of the total figurine heights. Occasionally the artists added some naturalistic touches such as protruding abdomens or navels. Both males and females are represented. One head suggests that simple headdresses were worn. Figurines with Large Shocks of Hair (Fig. 67a-d) No complete figurine was found. We are fortunate that the data derived from the fragmentary material are sufficient to set up a type and to give a fairly accu- rate description of these figurines. Paste and surface finish. The paste, varying between hard and soft, is medium coarse grained, verging on coarse; its texture is granular on account of the abun- dant tempering material. The outer layers of the figu- rines are extremely friable. The surfaces were finger wiped and have a pronounced grainy appearance. Cracks and pits filled with a red pigment suggest that the figurines were originally painted red. Manufacturing technique. Core-and-cover method. The figurines consist of a hard core over which a fairly thick layer of clay was applied, which was in turn modeled into the desired head and body features. Aesthetic appearance. A three-dimensional rendering of the human body is emphasized; the individuals are represented in the round. True human proportions were not respected. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The hair, hanging full length in the back down to the loins, is indicated by fine vertical incised parallel lines. In front it was retained by a crownlike fold of cloth. The facial features are lost. The torsos are realistically repre- sented. The abdomen is prominent; a touch of natural- ism was added to it in the form of a navel indicated by a deep punch. The same candor or search for realism guided the artist's hand when he modeled the buttocks of the figurines. Hips are large, and the stubby legs with notchlike incisions to mark the toes, are not unlike those of some Tlatilco figurines. The sex of the individuals is not indicated. Ornaments and clothing. They show a fold of cloth to retain the hair. There is also a kind of bow fixed in the hair at the back of the head (fig. 67d). Customs. We infer that the people of the Goma phase went naked. Dimensions. The small figurine in figure 67b meas- ures 5.2 cm. Granting that the head of this type of figurine amounts to about one-third of its total length, we infer that the figurine in figure 67d had an original height of 25 to 30 cm. Chronological position. Goma phase (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. Lieza and Boca del Rio. All-Jaw Type (Fig. 67e) Paste and surface finish. The paste, a fine clay with no visible tempering material, is dense and homo- geneous; it is fired hard and dark brown. The clay is identical to that used to plaster the wattled walls of the Goma houses. The surfaces of the figurines are well smoothed. Manufacturing technique. It seems likely that the figurines were fashioned out of a single lump of clay. Aesthetic appearance. Although crude and "primi- tive" looking, the figurine is quite expressive. Its sketchy facial features, body contour, and unfinished back are distinctive features. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The figu- rine in figure 67e represents a female; the sex of the second figurine (not illustrated) is undetermined. The face, as broad as it is long, and somewhat asymmetri- cally shaped, is flat from bregma to chin and curved from ear to ear; it sloped backward forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the axis of the body. The lower jaw is prominent and well modeled; this charac- teristic prompted us to name this type All-Jaw. The eyes were probably made of two flattened oval fillets of clay; their corners are indicated by two drag-and-jab gouges, the strokes of which were directed from the</page><page sequence="112">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 113 a 5g 1 cm scale h FIG. 67.

The nose is formed by two clay ridges raised as a result of the gouging of the eyes. A pellet of clay was added to form the tip of the nose. The mouths consist of one punctation at each corner. Eye sockets, brow ridges, cheekbones, and ears are omitted. The head is sepa- rated from the body by a groove meant to represent the neck. The shoulders are rounded. On one figu- rine, the breasts are shown by two conical pellets cen- trally punctated. The back of the figurine is longi- tudinally grooved. Chronological position. Goma phase (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza. Discussion. These crude portrayals were inadvert- ently collected from among a dozen lumps of fired clay bearing impressions of poles and twigs, as specimens attesting to the construction of wattle-and-daub houses. Washing revealed that two of these lumps of fired clay were not fragments of houses but figurines. The fact that they are made of the same clay as that used to plaster walls, and the stick impression in the back of one figurine suggest that these figurines might have been fashioned and stuck to a wall on the occasion of the building of a house. Their firing occurred when the house was burned down. THE KUAK PHASE Neither the All-Jaw type nor the figurines with the large shocks of hair of the Goma phase survived into the Kuak phase. Instead, we find the Seated Figurine type whose paste is similar to that of Atempan Scraped pots. Seated Figurine Type (Fig. 67f and g) This type is represented by two figurines. Paste and surface finish. For paste and surface color see under Atempan Scraped: Atempan Variety. The surfaces of the figurines are smoothed and grainy. Manufacturing technique. The two figurines are compounded. Heads, arms, legs, eyes, and mouths are indicated by clay pellets, rods, or disks welded to a central core representing the trunk. Aesthetic appearance. These are realistically mod- eled in terms of body depth and sitting position. The posture is natural and relaxed. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The face is prognathic. The eyes are made of two tiny saucer- shaped disks of clay. The muzzle-like mouth is indi- cated by a thick curved disk of clay. Chins, noses, eye sockets, and cheekbones are omitted. The shoulders are rounded, the trunks short and thick-set. The arms, rather slender, are made of rods of clay of even diam- eter. The digits are not marked. The legs of the figurine in figure 67f are made of two thin rods of clay; those of the complete figurine are two parallel and horizontal stumpy rods stuck to the torso. Little work was done on the backs. The waists are indicated by a constriction. Both figures are sexless. Ornanents and clothing. One figurine (fig. 67g) has a band around the top of its forehead and a roach- like headdress or haircut with two shallow depressions on its top. The necklaces are made of tiny perforated disks of clay. The complete figurine wears bands or bracelets on the upper arms and has a tassel hanging on the nape of the neck. The headless figurine has two ornaments in the form of either aprons, tassels, or small bags. A similar ornament is worn by a figurine of the Donkey Head type (fig. 681). The complete figurine has a laterally perforated head, which suggests that the figurine was worn around the neck as a piece of jewelry or an amulet. Dimensions. The complete figurine (fig. 67g) meas- ures 5.1 cm. Chronological position. Kuak and Niti phases (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio. Discussion. Figurines with upper arm bands or bracelets are quite uncommon during the Formative Period. THE NITI PHASE One specimen of the Seated Figurine type was found in a Niti level. One figurine which typologically and aesthetically belongs to the Coffee Bean Eye type of the Xuku phase, was found in a Niti level, and seems unquestionably intrusive. The figurines of the Coffee Bean Eye type are discussed under the Xuku phase. THE XUKU PHASE The Xuku phase is characterized by four highly dis- tinctive types: Coffee Bean Eye, Donkey Head, Starfish, and H-III-IV. Figurines of these four types occur in small quantities and they reflect the existence of several clear-cut technological, typological, and conceptual traditions. The artists followed standardized patterns of model- ing which resulted in rigid portrayals. Variations within each type are limited. Two types, the Starfish and the H-III-IV, are crudely manufactured. The Donkey Head and Coffee Bean Eye types, on the other hand, are carefully modeled and finished. In terms of manufacturing techniques, monoceramic and compounded figurines prevail. The figurines are all solid. The ornaments, headdresses, and some facial features are filleted, incised, or punctated. Several figurines were painted or red-slipped. Both males and females are shown, usually standing. The attention is captured by the facial expressions of the figurines. The facial features, occupying almost all of the face surface, are overemphasized and closely drawn together. The bodies are sketchily fashioned, with rudimentary limbs in the form of conical stumps;</page><page sequence="114">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 115 their backs are unfinished. True proportions were not achieved. The heads may account for as much as half of the total figurine lengths. The custom of covering the body, the wearing of new types of headdresses and ornaments, and the artificial deformation of heads were introduced during the Classic Period. It is not impossible that each type of figurines con- ceptualizes one social or professional class of people. The Donkey Head figurines seem to represent priests. The time duration of each type is short and restricted to the Early Classic Period. None, however, becomes extinct without contributing some attributes to the succeeding figurine types. The H-III-IV type is ances- tral to the Gas-Mask type of the Late Classic, and the Starfish type to the Stocky-Body type. The eyes of Realistic A, Realistic B, and Realistic C are derived from those of the Coffee Bean Eye type. Coffee Bean Eye Type (Figs. 67h, 68a-d) Paste and surface finish. The base clay contains a moderate to fair amount of fine, evenly grained parti- cles. The texture of the paste is dense. The surfaces of the figurines are reddish brown to dark brown and were carefully smoothed and probably polished. Some figurines were painted red. Manufacturing technique. The core-and-cover method was used to make one figurine (fig. 67h); the remain- ing figurines appear to be compounded. Aesthetic appearance. True proportions were not achieved. The heads are outsized compared to the body lengths. It is probable that all of the figurines were modeled in the round. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The bodies of males and females with limbs indicated by short stumplike projections are rudimentarily represented. The artists focused their attention on the faces. The facial features are disproportionately large in relation to the total surface of the faces. The noses, eyes, and mouths are tightly drawn together leaving no space between them. As viewed from the front, the heads sometimes have a pear-shaped outline. The noses, often beaklike and huge, were pinched out of the face. The nostrils are indicated by two punctations in three figurines. As viewed from above, several heads have a triangular shape, with the nose forming a ridge be- tween the two planes of the face (fig. 68a, b). The eyes, made of two elongated pellets of clay, are placed on either side of the nose; they have a broad gouge or groove made with two strokes starting from the center of the eye. A ridge was left in the center of the eye, which was slit or punctated to indicate the iris. Occa- sionally a narrow rim around the eyes indicates the eye- lids. The mouths consist of flattened clay fillets hori- zontally grooved. The corners of the mouths are slightly turned upward. The lips appear to be everted, which adds realism to the expression of the faces. The backs of the heads are flattened. The hair is shown in two cases. The eye sockets, brow ridges, and cheek- bones are omitted. The figurines are heavy-jowled and have well-modeled chins (figs. 67h, 68a). The ears are suggested by low protuberances. Ornaments and clothing. Three figurines wear choker-type necklaces. Medium-size earplugs are also worn. One figurine (fig. 67h) has an arclike headdress crowning the top of its head and two ribbons or hanks of hair in the back. Customs. The stepped haircut (fig. 67h) is a style widely distributed in Maya figurines and figures of the Smiling Complex. The figurines are shown in the nude. Dimensionis. The heads vary between 2.5 and 6 cm. in height. The complete figurine in figure 67h is 8.4 cm. tall. Chronological position. Xuku phase or Early Classic (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Lieza. The Donkey Head Type (Fig. 68e-l) Paste and surface finish. A paste with abundant fine-grained temper was used. Its texture is compact. The body surfaces are evenly smoothed and wiped; the head surfaces are extremely well smoothed. Manufacturing technique. All figurines are of the monoceramic type. The heads, bodies, and limbs were shaped from a single lump of clay. The facial features, ornaments, and headdresses were added in the form of incisions and punctations. Filleting was very sparsely used. Aesthetic appearance. The heads account for about one-third of the total length of the figurines. One fea- ture that differentiates these figurines from the Coffee Bean Eye type is that the mouths, eyes, and noses occupy a much smaller area in relation to the surface of the faces. The figurines achieve a fair degree of sophistication and seem to be rigidly stylized. They do not approach our modern ideals of aesthetics. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The bodies are rather flat. The arms consist of two short conical stubs, the legs of two rounded knobs. One figurine is shown in a seated position (fig. 68k). The heads are pear-shaped as viewed from the front; they have heavy jowls which tend to spread on the shoulders and terminate in two low swellings indicating the ears. Their elongated flattened skulls suggest artificial head deformation. The slanting eyes are made of oval wads of clay with one shallow groove and one small puncta- tion in the center to indicate the iris. The slanting eyes are above the nose, unlike those of the Coffee Bean Eye type. One outstanding feature is the hanging muzzle-like nose made of a wad of clay, which termi- nates at sternum height in a short horizontal groove to indicate the mouth. The nostrils are marked by two</page><page sequence="115">116 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. IC~~~~~~ X e ~~~~~~~~~~~~f i k 0 5 10 cm scale FIG. 68. Figurines. a-d.

In profile, the total effect is that of a donkey head, and hence we get the name of this type. The eye sockets, chins, eyebrow ridges, and cheekbones are omitted. The shoulders join the heads at cheek height. The necks are suppressed. Although the bodies are shown fully clothed, realism was stretched as far as indicating the navels in four out of seven figurines. Only males seem to be represented. Ornaments and clothing. They wear a gown or per- haps a wrap-around skirt reaching down to the ankles. The gown illustrated in figure 681 seems to be fastened in front with clasps or toggles which are suggested by spade-shaped impressions. All figurines have head ornaments, usually turbans adorned with some kind of beads or stones, and occasionally flat tapering hats. Two figurines have a forelock. The necklaces consist of three large oval tubular beads. The majority of the figurines wear small circular earplugs; one pair of earplugs is decorated with a cross motif (fig. 68g) simi- lar to that on the gown of the figurine shown in figure 68i. One figurine (fig. 681) wears a kind of bag or tassel like that shown in figure 67f. The seated figu- rine (fig. 68k) has a strap passing under the left arm and over the right shoulder. Customs. The elongated crania suggest artificial head deformation. The long gowns may have been worn for ceremonial purposes. Dimensions. The smallest figurine measures 6.3 cm. Granting that the heads account for one-third of the total length, we infer that the largest figurine was about 18 cm. Chronological position. Xuku phase or Early Classic (tables 1 and 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio, Lieza, Huilotepec, and Tehuantepec. Discussion. The gowns, the small earplugs, the necklaces with large oval beads, and the cross symbol which characterizes these figurines suggest a specific class of people, possibly priests, and indicate that a series of new cultural elements, especially clothing, had been introduced. Starfish Type (Fig. 69a and b) Paste and surface finish. One figurine is made of a fine-grained paste containing a high proportion of tiny mica spangles. The second figurine has a medium coarse-grained paste with large stray particles. The paste texture of both specimens is dense and homo- geneous. The surfaces are smoothed. Manufacturing technique. The monoceramic figu- rines were hand modeled. It is probable that a single lump of clay was used for the body, head, and limbs, and that the facial features and ornaments were appliqueed. Aesthetic appearance. The modeling is sketchy, with no attempt at realism or naturalism. No feature was emphasized; each is reduced to its simplest expression. The heads are nearly as long as the bodies. The figures consist of four limbs and a head radiating from a com- mon center. In front view they look like five-branched starfish. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The figu- rines suffer from a dearth of details. The bodies are not clearly delineated. The heads are crudely shaped. One head is laterally flattened. * The eyes and mouths are made of rectangular fillets with drag-and-jab im- pressions at the corners, and are fairly large in relation to the total surface of the face. The tips of the stubby arms and legs are stamped to indicate the hands and feet. The chins, necks, ears, etc., are omitted. Ornaments and clothing. Simple headdresses are probably made from a fold of textile (fig. 69a). The necklaces are quite distinctive and consist of a large circular pendant hanging from a string. One figurine wears circular earspools. Dimensions. The smaller is 5.5 cm., the larger, 7.5 cm. Chronological position. Xuku phase or Early Classic (table 1). Site occurrence. One was encountered in our Lieza excavations, the other, on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Discussion. The Starfish figurines are quite distinc- tive. The type of necklace is new. H-III-IV Type (Fig. 69c-f) Paste and surface finish. Fine to medium coarse- grained pastes with variable amounts of temper were used. Their textures range from friable to very hard. The surfaces were finger patted and are uneven. One figurine was probably painted red. Manufacturing technique. Two figurines belong to the monoceramic class. The remaining figurines are compounded. Filleting is limited to facial features, ornaments, and headdresses. Their craftsmanship is crude and clumsy. Aesthetic appearance. The faces are usually wider than they are long. Naturalism or realism was not sought. The facial features occupy almost all the face area. Anatomical proportions were not achieved and little attention was paid to symmetry. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. No at- tempt was made to give a true human shape to the heads. The eyes, noses, and mouths are closely bunched together. The prominent noses were given no definite shape. The bulging eyes and the pouting mouths are made of wartlike pellets of clay with two drag-and-jab punctations to mark their corners. Unlike the eyes of the other figurine types, those of the H-III-IV type are set horizontally in the face. One specimen from Juchitan (fig. 69e) has nostrils and pupils indicated with punctations. The heads do not suggest artificial</page><page sequence="117">118 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. b a d ~~~~~~ef 0 5 cm scale FIG. 69. Figurines. a, b.

The skulls are low and receding except for the Juchit'an head. In two cases (fig. 69c, d) the chins and jaws were put into relief by low modeling. The limbs are indicated by short conical projections, except those of the Juchit'an figurine. Ornaments and clothing. The finery of these figures consists of a simple crescent-shaped headcover probably made of a broad textile fold, the ends of which are crossed over the top of the head. The figurine in figure 69f has a nondescript sort of headdress. The foreheads are concealed by a fringe of hair cut at brow height. Circular earplugs, earspools, bracelets, and necklaces are occasionally depicted. Customs. The style of haircut combined with low flat headdresses is widely distributed in Classic times. Dimensions. The figurine in figure 69f measures 7.3 cm. The heads vary between 3 and 4.4 cm. Chronological position. Xuku phase or Early Classic (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza, Pixixi, and Juchit'an. Discussion. This type is probably ancestral to or related to the Gas-Mask type. The figurine from Juchi- t'an (fig. 69e) was incorporated in our material because it represents a transitional stage between the H-III-IV and the Gas-Mask types. This type is akin to types H-III and H-IV defined by Vaillant (1930: p. 136, pl. 29). THE EARLY TIXUM SUB-PHASE Small solid figurines, painted or slipped, made of untempered clays are typical of this sub-phase. Two types have been identified: Stocky-Body and Jaguar Man. The figurines are modeled in the round. Their backs are unfinished. The artists were concerned with the frontal aspect only. All figurines are shown standing. It is our strong belief that the Stocky-Body figurines have been intentionally broken or mutilated. This belief is suggested by the nature of the fractures and by the near absence of the heads. Type H-III-IV continues in this sub-phase from the Xuku phase. Stocky-Body Type (Fig. 69g-i) Paste and surface finish. The paste includes a fair amount of silty to fine-grained temper. Its texture is hard and compact. The surface colors range from yellowish-orange to pink-orange. One figurine is made of a paste similar to that of the Jordan Self-Slipped ceramic type. The surfaces are evenly wiped. It is likely that all four figurines of our collection were painted red. Manufacturing technique. The monoceramic figu- rines were each shaped from a single lump of clay. Filleting, used for ornaments and facial features, was supplemented by incising and punctating. Aesthetic appearance. Little can be derived from the fragmentary material. The figurines were shaped in the round. The legs are reduced to short stumps; the arms are more realistically portrayed. It is not im- probable that the heads were as long as the bodies. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The bodies are thick-set. The arms are made of tapering rods of clay, with the hands resting on the hips or on the abdomen. Toes and digits are indicated with drag-and- jab punctations. Only males are represented. The data on facial features were derived from a head which was a surface find. All features are remarkably well modeled and they occupy almost all the surface of the face. The eyes are made of wads of clay with deep grooves. The iris of the eye is indicated with a deep punctation. Eyebrows are indicated, whereas the ears and the chin are omitted. The back of the head is unfinished. Ornaments and clothing. The bodies are shown un- clothed. Bracelets are indicated with punctated fillets. Three out of four figurines have choker-type necklaces made of large oval beads. The turban-like headdress in figure 69i is probably made of several textile folds adorned with stones. Earplugs are indicated. Dimensions. The bodies vary from 4.5 to 5 crn. Chronological position. Tixum phase to Late Classic (tables 1-3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio, Lieza, and the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Discussion. This type is related to the Starfish type. Both types have the same body proportions, the same stocky legs, and the same indications for digits and toes. It seems doubtful that the heads broke off accident- ally. All fractures are identical and run through the necks, which are the thickest section of the bodies. The fractures are flat, as though the removal of the heads was performed with a celt. The heads belonging to this type were not found in our excavations and may have been deposited in another place. Jaguar Man Type (Fig. 70k-o) Paste and surface finish. The compact paste contains little silty tempering material, and has a soft, velvety tactile feel. The surfaces rub off readily and leave a powdery film on the fingers. The surface color varies between buff and light cinnamon. One figurine was painted red. Manufacturing technique. The figurines are com- pounded. The details were added by incision and punctation. Aesthetic appearance. The features are sketchily depicted. There is no attempt at naturalism or realism. Anatomical proportions were not achieved. The artists, focusing their attention on the front, left the backs unfinished. Stylistic rendering of anatomtical features. The figu-</page><page sequence="119">120 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. rine from Juchitan (fig. 70o) has a well-modeled face with a lively expression. The nose is conical. The eyes, salient and slightly slanting, are made of two slabs of clay with two oblique punctations. The mouth is filleted. The eyes, nose, and mouth are large. No head deformation is suggested. The jaw is firmly out- lined. The head in figure 70k has eyebrow ridges. The ears are omitted. The short torso is supported by two conical legs with incisions to mark the toes. The arms are curved along the sides of the bodies with the hands resting in front of the hips. The hair, indicated by fine, incised lines, is shown worn short and brushed back. Ornaments and clothing. It seems that the breech- clouts, the anklets, bracelets, and headdresses are made of the same material, strips of jaguar fur. Round, solid earplugs are depicted. Dimensions. The figurine in figure 70o measures 6.3 cm.; the remaining fragments suggest somewhat larger figurines. Chronological position. Tixum phase or Middle and Late Classic (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and Juchitan. Discussion. The paste and texture of these figurines set them apart from all other types. THE LATE TIXUM SUB-PHASE In the introduction we remarked that a fairly high figurine art developed in the western Pacific Plains. 'This development was caused by the introduction of new styles and new manufacturing techniques. The major technological innovations are the casting of figu- rines in molds and the assembling of figurines from pre-fabricated parts. Almost all figurine types betray their foreign derivation. Mold-made figurines did not supersede hand-modeled figurines. Both are found side by side and share the same stylistic characteristics. There are four types of hand-modeled figurines, all very closely related to one another: Realistic A, Realistic B (or Elongated Head type), Realistic C (or Slashed Ear type), and Hollow Egg-Head type. The two latter types are represented by surface finds. The mold-made figurines are also subdivided into four types: the Mayoid Mold-Made Slab type and the Mold-Made Face type found in stratigraphic position; the remaining two types were identified from surface finds. One type includes figu- rines of Zapotec inspiration or manufacture, and the other is represented by one head built according to the same technological principles as those used to make the figurines of the Smiling Complex of Veracruz. The artists availed themselves of the same pastes as those used for making pots. The figurines are usually painted and solid. Some hollow figurines do occur.- There is a definite attempt at realism during the Late Tixum sub-phase. Almost all facial features are indi- cated, such as cheekbones, chins, alae, eyebrow ridges, etc. Much care was lavished on the bodies or none at all. Mold casting and hand modeling led to opposite results. The mold-made figurines have inert and listless expressions, while the hand-shaped figurines have lively expressions. Several kinds of head deformation seem to be repre- sented. The new cultural features introduced during this sub-phase include tailored dresses, the quexkemitl, elaborate headdresses, and the composite earplugs. The latter is found exclusively on Mayoid Mold-Made Slab figurines. Figurine types such as Gas-Mask, Tehuanacoid Mold- Made Slab, and the Rod type, established on the basis of surface finds, probably belong to this sub-phase. Realistic A Type (Figs. 69j-1; 70a-f) Paste and surface finish. Two pastes were used, one containing coarse temper and the other containing fine- grained temper; their textures are compact. The sur- faces of the figurines are evenly smoothed. The coarse- grained pastes fired brown with a tinge of red. The fine-grained pastes are cinnamon to buff. All figurines were slipped or painted. Manufacturing technique. The fragmentary material suggests that they were hand modeled. The head shown in figure 70f is part of an articulated figurine. Aesthetic appearance. It seems that the artists con- cerned themselves with representing real individuals. The features of the figurines with medium coarse paste are slightly oversize in relation to the surface of the face (figs. 691; 70a, b. d), whereas those of the figu- rines made of fine paste achieve almost natural propor- tions. The faces are usually expressive, lively, and harmoniously shaped. The only complete figurine indi- cates that the bodies were twice as long as the heads. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The mod- eling of the facial planes, contours, and features is accurate. The face depth is true to reality. The eyes and mouths are made of flat wads of clay with two oblique gouges to indicate their corners. In addition, the eyes have one central punctation to mark the iris. In figure 69k the mouth and eyes have one longitudinal gouge. The nostrils are indicated with two punctations. The cheeks tend to be chubby. The hunchback (fig. 69j) is gaunt and has sunken cheeks. The skulls, with slight frontal flattening, are moderately elongated. The ears are small and covered with the hair. The hair is parted in the middle and brought to the back of the head where it rests on the nape of the neck or hangs loosely down the back. The necks are indicated. The bodies were sketchily fashioned. The figurine in figure 70e has the most rudimentary limbs recorded, so much so that it looks as if its arms and legs had been ampu- tated. The backs were left unfinished. One female is indicated by filleted breasts.</page><page sequence="120">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 121 a bl~~~ d 8 j k~~~~~~~~ c m s c ae in #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 70. Figurines. a-f.

No clothes are indicated. Several figurines wear turbans. The earplugs are strikingly small. The necklaces usually consist of ring-beads. Customs. The slight flattening of the foreheads sug- gests that artificial head deformation was practiced. The small earplugs and simple hairdo suggest that the figurines represent common folk. Dimensions. The heads range from 3.6 to 6.8 cm. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase or Middle Classic (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza, Pixixi, and the vicinity of Guiengola. Mayoid Mold-Made Slab Type (Fig. 70g-j) Paste and surface finish. The paste, hard and dense, contains a large amount of medium coarse to coarse- grained temper. The surfaces have a sandy tactile feel. It is likely that the figurines were slipped or painted. The paste of the figurine in figure 70j is unlike any paste recorded in our excavations; it is extremely hard and very sparsely tempered with medium grained par- ticles. Manufacturing technique. Mold-made. Aesthetic appearance. The heads are rigidly but realistically stylized. Anatomical proportions are accu- rately rendered. The facial features are blurred and inert looking, as is often the case with mold-made figurines. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The upper eyelids are oval or tear-drop shaped and bulge, sug- gesting closed eyes or bashful downward glances. The eyes are set in sockets surmounted with well-marked ridges. The nose is realistically modeled, with normal flare and alae. The mouths are half open. Occasionally teeth are exposed. The cheekbones are salient. The foreheads are occasionally edged with a hair fringe. The ears are omitted. Ornaments and clothing. These figurines do not represent ordinary people. Two of the figurines wear some sort of a tall headdress (fig. 70g, i). The com- posite earplug, made of a round disk or ring with a central projecting rod, is new (fig. 70g, h). Customs. The headdresses were probably part of a priest's paraphernalia. The question mark sign on the figurine in figure 70j is similar to that worn occasionally by figurines of the Smiling Complex of Veracruz. Dimensions. The length of the heads varies between 4 and 7.5 cm. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase or Late Classic (table 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio, Lieza, and Juchitan. Discussion. No prototype of these figurines was found in our excavations. The mold casting, the slab form of the figurines, the composite earplugs, and the headdresses are traits which probably have their center of origin outside the Tehuantepec area. Mold-Made Face Type (Fig. 71) Paste and surface finish. See under Jordan Self- Slipped: Jordan Variety. Manufacturing technique. Although all the figurines of this type are identical in appearance, paste, and sur- face finish, they are subdivided into three classes: figurines with mold-made faces and hand-shaped bodies (fig. 71e), entirely mold-made figurines with filleted details (fig. 71g, 1i), and hand-shaped figurines (fig. 71i, j). The last are rare. The type was named after the majority of the figurines, those with mold-made faces and hand-shaped bodies. Thus the type name is not too much of a misnomer. The figurines with mold-made faces and hand-shaped bodies were made as follows: a broad long rod of clay was used for the body and head alike with the addition of small pointed rods for the limbs. In the majority of cases the main clay stalk seems to have been narrowed to form the neck, not only by stretching, but also by pinching some of the clay to the back. The end protruding above the long neck was pressed into an open mold and often in such a manner that the neck is left with an odd forward curve (Eyman, 1953: p. 8). A by-product of this molding process was the creation of a flange which frames the upper part of the face (fig. 70a, d). The ledge varies from a very broad and thin expansion of clay to a narrow flange. The narrow flanges are usually associated with round heads, the wide flanges with the flat heads. The flanges served as a base for the headdress filleting, which is so elabo- rate in the more sophisticated pieces that it conceals the extension entirely. The figurines which are entirely mold-made have features such as ears, earplugs, noses, and headdresses added by filleting (fig. 71g, h). In the hand-shaped figurines (fig. 71i, j) the details are filleted. Aesthetic appearance. The shape of the head and the angular features identify this type. The profile has a lozenge-shaped outline. The headdresses, clothes, and ornaments are realistically represented. The heads are less than one-third of the total figurine lengths. The figurines are shown in stiff, conventionalized postures. The facial features are blurred. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The fore- heads are flat and triangular and slope back from the eyebrows. The face is flat and oval, narrower at the chin, and occasionally approaches a heart shape. The eyes are oval to tear-drop shaped, and seem to be closed. The noses, when not broken off, are exag- geratedly elongated (fig. 71g, h). The mouths are generally shown half open. The teeth may be exposed (fig. 71g, h). Chins are well shaped.

In the figurines with unclothed bodies, the arms are indicated with short conical projections often bent backward; the legs are slightly longer than the arms. The sex of the females may be indicated by slight modeling of the breasts. The figurines with clothed bodies are "those on which arms and legs as well as the trunk itself, are in better pro- portion to the head" (Eyman, 1953: p. 9). The figu- rine in figure 71e rests on its legs and has a prop in the back. The arms may be incised to indicate the digits (fig. 71f). Ornaments and clothing. Unclothed figurines have simple headdresses (fig. 71g-j) which may consist of a single fold of cloth wrapped in a turban-like fashion (fig. 71h, j). Clothed figurines have ornate and com- plex headdresses (fig. 71c). Wrap-around garments (fig. 71b), tailored dresses (fig. 71e), simple and com- posite earplugs, disk and ring bead necklaces, and two- string necklaces are also shown. Customs. The tall, complicated, ornate headdresses and the tailored dresses suggest an elaboration in the sartorial art of the people. Dimensions. The small figurine in figure 71j meas- ures 5.1 cm., the large head in figure 71d, 6.2 cm. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase (tables 1 and 3). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio, Lieza, Mixtequilla, and Ixtepec. Discussion. This type is related through the com- posite earplugs to the mold-made slab figurines. Realistic B or Elongated Head Type (Fig. 72a-e, h) Paste and surface finish. See under Realistic A type. Manufacturing technique. Only heads are available for study; they are all hand shaped. The facial features and ornaments are filleted, incised, or punctated. Aesthetic appearance. The realistically modeled heads have lively expression (fig. 72a, b, d). Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. Viewed from the front, the heads have an almost perfect oval shape. The aquiline noses proj ect over fully lipped mouths. The eyes, made of elongated wads of clay set in sockets, are bulging, strongly slanted and large; their corners are marked by two oblique gouges which caused flared lids to appear. The iris is indicated by a central punctation. The brow ridges are low and partly concealed by the large eyes. The nostrils are repre- sented by two punctations. The foreheads slope back. The skulls are tapered and flattened. The ears are suggested by two low clay pellets. The backs of the heads are unfinished. Ornaments and clothing. The headdresses, decorated with stone disks, are simple and probably consist of a fold of cloth wrapped around the top of the head or of a headband retaining the hair. Customs. The head deformation seems to involve the flattening of the frontal and occipital areas. Dimensions. The heads measure 2.5 to 4.2 cm. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase prob- ably (table 2). Site occurrence. Boca del Rio, Lieza, Tehuantepec, and Mixtequilla. Discussion. This type is derived from three types previously analyzed: Donkey Head, Coffee Bean Eye, and Realistic A. Donkey Head figurines contributed the form of the head, Coffee Bean Eye figurines the eyes, and Realistic figurines the mouth. GROUP 2 As stated on page 112, this group of figurines con- sists of types which have been established on the basis of surface finds. Some have attributes, such as paste or style, which can be tentatively placed in relation to either the Classic or Postclassic periods. Realistic C or Slashed-Ear A Type (Fig. 72f, g) Paste and surface finish. The head in figure 72f has a paste and surface similar to those of Huilotepec Decorated vessels. Its surface is highly polished. The head in figure 72g is made of the same paste as that used to make Tlacotepec Red-on-Clouded pots. Manufacturing technique. The heads are hand shaped. No bodies were found. Aesthetic appearance. The facial features and the head contours are accurately modeled. Stylistic rendering of anatomical featuires. See under Realistic B type. Ornaments and clothing. Some kinds of ornaments, in the form of clay disks, are indicated in front and on either side of the heads. One figurine wears small earplugs (fig. 72g). Customs. The helices of the ears are slashed with horizontal cuts. The heads suggest artificial deforma- tion. Dimensions. The smaller head measures 5.5 cm., the larger, 7 cm. Chronological position. These heads are tentatively assigned to the Classic Period. Site occurrence. Lieza and Tehuantepec, surface. Discussion. This type is unquestionably related to Realistic A and B types; it differs from the latter in pastes, surface finish, and slashed ears. Figurines with polished surfaces are extremely rare. It seems probable that the figurine shown in figure 72f was made by the same people who manufactured Huilo- tepec Decorated vessels. Zapotec Urns, Mask, and Figurine (Fig. 73ac-d) The fragments were identified by Dr. Bernal in 1961 at the American Museum of Natural History.</page><page sequence="124">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 125 Cocijo. The small urn (fig. 73a) is made of a paste abundantly mixed with coarse-grained temper. The core is gray and blends into two thin yellowish surface layers. The surface was originally covered with a thick coat of yellowish paint or slip. The face is the only mold-made element. The remaining parts, such as earplugs, nose, arms, legs, and sash, are filleted. This urn is 11.6 cm. in height, and 4.1 cm. in diameter. According to Dr. Bernal it was not manufactured in the Valley of Oaxaca, and stylistically he assigns it to the Monte Alban IIlb period. The Cocijo mask illustrated in figure 73b is mold- made and has two tenons in the back.

The paste con- sists of a clay mixed with medium coarse-grained temper. Its core is black and blends into a cinnamon- colored surface. The mask was found in the vicinity of La Mixtequilla. It also belongs to the Monte Alban IlIb period. At the Frisell Museum, Mitla, Oaxaca, there is one fragment of a god with Cocijo's head on the headdress allegedly found at Boca del Rilo (fig. 106). Acorn paikante (fig. 73c). This head is made of compact gray clay sparsely tempered with fine to medium coarse quartz particles and what appear to be black flaky particles. The paste, extremely hard, can be matched with none of the pastes so far identified. Diosa 3-serpiente (?). This small slab figurine (fig. 73d), cast in a mold, wears a quexkemitl. The design on the fringe is post-molding incised. A necklace made of large spherical beads is worn around the neck. It is not improbable that this fragment is of Classic origin. Discussion. These fragments suggest that cultural relationships were established between the Pacific Plains and the Valley of Oaxaca by the Late Classic Period. THE ULAM PHASE No human representation from the Ulam phase has been found in our excavations. Instead, two zoo- morphic heads were found, that of a deer and that of a jaguar. One figurine, Mazapan, identified on the basis of surface finds, undoubtedly belongs to the Postclassic Period. Mazapan Type (Fig. 73e-h) The material under consideration has been divided into Variety A and Variety B. Variety A (fig. 73e, g, h). Paste and surface finish. The paste contains no visible temper; it is compact and fired gray or brown. The surfaces are smooth. Manufacturing technique. The Variety A figurines were cast in a shallow, flat, positive mold. It is not improbable that these figurines were stamped out of slabs of clay, using the mold like a cookie cutter. The possibility of this is borne out by the even, flat, and smooth back surfaces, with no unevenness as would result from pressing the clay into the mold with the fingers. Aesthetic appearance. The figurines are flat replicas of line drawings. They undoubtedly reflect a concept rather than depict real human beings. There is no attempt at realism or naturalism. All features are on the same level, rigidly stylized. Generally speaking, the figurines exhibit simple and somewhat crude skill. The faces lack expression. The noses, eyes, and mouths are oversized and occupy almost all the surface of the faces. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The out- line of the face is suggested by a shallow groove. The eyes and mouth are set horizontally in the faces and are represented by ovals with longitudinal bars. The nose consists of an elongated triangle. The hair is depicted by lines and seems to be arranged in two lateral lobes (fig. 73g). Grosscup (1961: p. 39) sug- gested that these lobes represent a kind of headdress. The arms are sketchily represented. Ornaments and clothing. Round earplugs are drawn on the cheeks. The right earplug of the figurine in figure 73g was replaced by an applied clay disk. A long gown with a large circular pectoral plate is shown in figure 73h. Dimensions. The faces average 2.5 cm. in length. Variety B (fig. 73f). Paste and surface finish. The paste contains abundant fine tempering material; it is hard and buff colored. Manufacturing technique. See Variety A. Aesthetic appearance. The face is slightly more realistically shaped than that of Variety A. The face plane is slightly rounded and not flat. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. Unlike the mouth of Variety A, that of Variety B lacks the transverse bar. The nose and the chin are shaped in low relief. Ornaments and clothing. Earplugs are indicated and a choker-type necklace is worn around the neck. Dimension. The head measures 3.5 cm. Chronologica,l position (Varieties A and B). Stylis- tically, typologically, and technologically these figurines are related to the Mazapan figurines. Therefore, we tentatively assign Varieties A and B to a period ranging from about A.D. 900 to A.D. 1200, possibly A.D. 1300. Site occurrence. Vicinity of Tehuantepec, surface. Pierced-Ear Type (Fig. 73i, j) Paste and surface finish. The paste is moderately tempered with fine-grained particles mixed with large stray quartz particles. It is hard and dense. It fired pink-buff to light apricot-buff. The surfaces are well smoothed. There are traces of reddish-brown slips. Manufacturing technique. The two heads at hand seem to have been hand-shaped. Details were added by means of fillets, punctations, and incisions. Aesthetic appearance. The heads are modeled in accurate relief. Some features, such as the eyes, ears,</page><page sequence="126">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 127 f\ a - efg ~~~, --A~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~' 5 ~~~~~~10 cm scale I j FIG. 73. Figurines and urns. a-c.

SOC- and mouths, are large in relation to the size of the heads. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The faces are oval. The eyes, contrary to the established norm, are set horizontally, and consist of thin slabs of clay set in deep sockets; they bear three punctations. The mouths are similarly made, but have only two puncta- tions. The chins are well modeled and in only one case was clay added to accentuate its relief. The ears are large. Ornaments and clothing. Moderately sized earspools are worn; a cap (?) (fig. 73j) is also shown. Customs. The helices of the ears are pierced. Dimensions. The heads average 4.4 cm. in length. Chronological position. We assign them tentatively to the Late Classic or Postclassic period. Site occurrence. Surface finds at Lieza and Juchit'an. Teotihuanacoid Mold-Made Slab Type (Fig. 74a-d) Paste and surface finish and manufacturing tech- nique. See under Mayoid Mold-Made Slab type. Aesthetic appearance. The features are proportion- ately slightly larger than in actuality. The face relief is not very accurately rendered. The body in figure 74c is depicted in a stiff, conventionalized posture; its forearms are too long and slender, its upper arms too short and thick. Stylistic rendering of anatomnical features. The faces are broader than they are wide and are slightly tri- angular in outline. The facial and body features are in low relief. The eyes, set horizontally, are marked by depressions. In one case, the iris is indicated by a low swelling (fig. 74b). The eyes are either oval or have a rounded lower lid and a straight upper lid. The nostrils have a moderate flare. Alae are occasionally shown. The mouths, with slightly bulging lips, are represented by oval or kidney-shaped depressions. The teeth are exposed in figure 74d. The ears, eyebrow ridges, cheekbones, and eye sockets are omitted. True body proportions were not achieved. Ornamnents and clothing. The body in figure 74c, which seems to represent a warrior in full regalia, wears a narrow cape and a tunic; two flaps hang down in front. A spherical bead necklace is around its neck. The composite earplugs (fig. 75b) consist of spools combined with two smaller solid beads or disks. Head- dresses are also represented. Dimensions. The length of the faces varies between 4 and 4.4 cm. Chronological position. Presumably Postclassic. Site occurrence. Lieza and Tehuantepec, surface. Discussion. Jose Luis Franco, who examined the figurines, believes that they are related to Teotihuacan figurines and remotely related to Toltec figurines. Gas-Mask Type (Fig. 74e-i) Paste and surface finish. See under Mold-Made Face type. Manufacturing technique. Except for one figurine which was produced by the core-and-cover method, all are either monoceramic or compounded. The facial features and ornaments were added in the form of fillets, incisions, and punctations. Aesthetic appearance. There is no attempt at real- ism, but there is a deliberate attempt at overemphasizing some features and minimizing others, which results in grotesque caricatures of ill-shapen humian beings. The huge eyes add a ghostly touch. The heads are too large in relation to the bodies. The attention is focused on the faces and the stunted arms and legs. Stylistic rendering of anatomnical features. The faces, triangular to oval, are smooth and curved. The eyes slant upward and are indicated by very thin oval slabs of clay lightly stamped. Failure to indicate the pupils accentuates the vacant and ghostly appearance. In figure 74h the eyes were stamped in the surface of the face. The noses are beaklike, narrow, and jutting, and are usually ornamented with two buttons on either side of the septum. The noses conceal tiny tadpole-like mouths made of thin fillets of clay longitudinally cut. The remaining facial features are omitted. The heads are separated from the bodies by thick, short necks. The bodies are sketchy affairs with short bent arms and legs. The digits and toes are indicated by short inci- sions. The backs are unfinished. Ornaments and clothing. The figurines are un- clothed; they occasionally wear a headdress or neck- lace. The headdresses consist of a single fold of textile forming a loop on either side of the head (fig. 74g) or of a lampshade-like bonnet (fig. 74h). The earplugs are generally small. Customs. The Gas-Mask figurines are the only ones in our collection wearing nose ornaments. Dimensions. The length of the faces varies between 1.7 and 2.5 cm. Chronological position. Judging from the paste and surface finish we tentatively correlate this type with the transitional period between the Late Classic and the Postclassic. Site occurrence. Lieza and Juchitan. Discussion. It is possible that this type evolved out of the H-III-IV type. The figurines in figure 69e and figure 74f could be regarded as intermediary stages in the evolution. The Gas-Mask type is particularly com- mon in the Juchitan-Ixtepec area. Rod Type (Fig. 74j-m) This heterogeneous type is typologically related to Realistic A and B types, and differs from the latter in</page><page sequence="128">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 129 a b _ w h ~~~~i4/~~~~~( J ,,k o 5 tO cm scale \W m FIG. 74.

Manufacturing technique. The heads and bodies were both shaped from one single lump of clay. The remaining features were added in the form of fillets, incisions, or punctations. The face of the figurine in figure 74k was applied to the rod. Aesthetic appearance. The facial features are heavy and large in relation to the surface of the face. The heads are only slightly shorter than the bodies, which are stiffly and conventionally sketched. These figurines are cruder replicas of Realistic A and B figurines. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The eyes are slanted. The nostrils are indicated by two puncta- tions. Usually the mouths are made of clay fillets with two oblique gouges directed from the center toward the corners. The ears are made of elongated rods of clay. The chins are vaguely outlined. The necks are usually omitted. The bodies are crudely shaped; trunks are stocky and have flat backs. The navel is repre- sented by a punctation. Short, conical, straight or curved projections indicate the limbs. The digits and toes are shown by short incisions. Ornamlents and clothing. Some sort of garment is worn by all the figurines. The couple shown in figure 74j and k are dressed alike, with a skirt wrapped below the navel and held with a belt. The figurine in figure 741 has a breech-clout. Necklaces are worn. Strangely enough, none of the figurines has ear ornaments. Dimensions. The figurines average 8 cm. in height. Site occurrence. Boca del Rio and the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Chronological position. Typologically we assign this type to the Classic period. GROUP 3 This group includes isolated finds, aberrant and un- specified fragments and figurines. Several of these pieces were found in our excavations. Tripod Figurine Type (Fig. 75a) Paste and surface finish. The paste is silty, dense, and hard. The surface, orange in color, is moderately polished. The figurine was white-slipped. Manufacturing technique. It was compounded; de- tails are supplied by incising and punctating. The figu- rine stands erect thanks to a prop in its back. Aesthetic appearance. Sketchy two-dimensional rep- resentation in a conventionalized manner is exemplified here. The head length amounts to two-fifths of the total body length. The head and the face show no relief modeling. The oversize facial features cover almost all the surface of the face. The limbs and body are abbreviated. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The face is triangular and tapers toward a rounded chin. The eyes are set horizontally and are made of thin slabs of clay with one hole punched in the middle to represent the iris, and two lateral oblique gouges. A blob of clay is the nose. The mouth is filleted. The ears are indicated by two low swellings. The neck is well indi- cated. The trunk is stocky and the limbs are short conical stumps. Incisions mark the toes and digits. The back is left unfinished. Ornaments and clothing. A breech-clout is worn, and a necklace with a central pendant. Dimiensions. The figurine is 6 cm. high. Chronological position. Probably late Late Classic. Discussion. This type seems to be a more schema- tized version of the Coffee Bean Eye type with which it is technologically related. Hzehueteotl (Fig. 75b) We named this figurine Huehueteotl, assuming that it represents one of the oldest gods of the Mexican pantheon. Paste and surface finish. The paste, oxidized and soft, is sparsely tempered with fine grained material. The surfaces are finger wiped. Manufacturing technique. The face is mold-made, the back, hand shaped. The irises are punched and the earplugs are filleted. The head is hollow. Aesthetic appearance. The face is modeled in the round in accurate relief. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The eyes are horizontally set in the face. The mouth is shown with the lips parted and the upper teeth exposed. Ornaments. Large round earplugs. The mask worn over the eye is one of Huehueteotl's attributes. Customs. This head was probably worn as an amu- let. A hole in the crest provides a means for suspension. Chronological position. The paste and technology suggest the Late Classic period. Site occurrence. Lieza, surface. Discussion. This head is technologically similar to those of the Smiling Complex of Veracruz. Twisted Face God or Dios Tuerto (Fig. 75c) Paste and surface finish. The paste contains abundant silty material. The surface is crudely wiped. Manufacturing technique. Hand modeled; facial features are filleted. Aesthetic appearance. The crude expression of the face was achieved by suppressing most of the facial features.</page><page sequence="130">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 FIGURINES 131 C a@ a o s m cm scal1e FIG. 75.

Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The head is made of a cube-like lump of clay. The nose consists of a thick rod of clay flanked by one tiny and one large eye. Chronological position. Late Tixum sub-phase (table 1). Site occurrence. Lieza. Discussion. This head, which apparently served as a knob on a lid, was identified by Jose Luis Franco. Twisted Face gods have been found in the Formative, Classic, and Postclassic periods. Body Fragment (Fig. 76c) The paste contains medium coarse temper. The sur- face, fairly well smoothed, was red-slipped or painted. The abdomen protrudes and has a punched hole to indicate the navel. A garment made of a fold of textile, fastening an apron, is tied around the loins. A neck- lace hangs from the neck. This fragment, found in Stratigraphic Pit B 1 at Boca del Rio, is contempo- raneous with the Seated Figurine type of the Kuak phase (table 2, see under Torsos). Funny Face (Fig. 75d) Paste and surface finish. The paste, dense and hard, has a silty texture. The surface was wiped. Manufacturing technique. The head and body both seem to have been shaped from a single lump of clay. The front part of the head received an additional layer of clay. The ornaments are filleted. Aesthetic appearance. There is no attempt at real- ism. The crudely shaped head contrasts with the skill- fully made necklace. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The large down-slanting bleary eyes are made of flat clay slabs with lateral impressions. The nose, now lost, formed a ridge between the eyes. Two tiny punctations mark the nostrils. A tiny pursed mouth is indicated by a punctation. The face is curved from ear to ear, is flat from the chin to the top of the head, and slopes back at a 45-degree angle. Its head shape is not unlike that of the All-Jaw figurine illustrated in figure 67e. Ornaments and clothing. The top of the forehead is decorated with two tassels. The neck is concealed under a neatly made four-string ring-bead necklace. Dimensions. The face is 3.3 cm. long and 4.5 cm. wide. Site occurrence. Vicinity of Tehuantepec. Portrait Face (Fig. 75e) Paste and surface finish. The paste contains a large amount of medium coarse temper. Its texture is fria- ble. The core is grayish-black, the surface, orange- brown. Manufacturing technique. Core-and-cover method. The core proj ects in the form of a tenon which was probably stuck into the body. Aesthetic appearance. This head represents the closest approximation of realism. Anatomical and physiognomic features are faithfully and accurately rendered. The face has a lively expression. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. All fea- tures are true to reality, as for instance, eyelids are indicated. The mouth is shown with lips, upper teeth, and tongue. Except for the hair which is filleted, all remaining features were directly modeled. Dimensions. The head measures 3.1 cm. Site occurrence. Surface find in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Realistic C or Slashed-Ear B Type (Fig. 75f) Paste and surface finish. See under Realistic A and B varieties. Manufacturing technique. The features are made of fillets on a hand-shaped head. Aesthetic appearance. The facial features are crudely and closely drawn together. The head seems to have been modeled with little care or skill. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The face is as long as it is wide. The eyes, set low, are slanted and made of rectangular clay fillets with a central punch to indicate the iris and two lateral oblique gouges. The mouth, similarly made, is filled with four small disks. The ears are long and slashed. The back is left un- finished. Ornament. The top of the head has some sort of decoration. Customs. The ears are slashed like those shown in figure 72f. Artificial head deformation is suggested by the elongated skull. Dimensions. The head measures 8.3 cm. Site occurrence. Surface find at Lieza. Old Prophet (Fig. 75g) Paste and surface finish. The clay is heavily mixed with medium coarse temper. The texture is compact. The surface is grainy and cinnamon-pink. Manufacturinig technique. The head is hand-shaped; details are filleted and carved away. Aesthetic appearance. The head is modeled in the round. Realism was achieved by means of extreme accentuation of the facial features. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The face is angular and long. The eyes are deeply set below prominent visor-like torii. The eyes with two central punctations occupy the whole width of the face. The</page><page sequence="132">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] FIGURINES 133 nose, now missing, has well-shaped alae. Two punches indicate the nostrils. The cheekbones are salient, the cheeks, sunken. The ears are made of rods of clay. The hair is cut short over the forehead and ears and is left long in the back. Ornamnents. Large circular earplugs. Customs. It is very possible that this figure wears a beard. Dimensions. The head measures 7.2 cm. Site occurrence. Lieza, surface. Hollow Egg-Head (Fig. 75h) Paste and surface finish. See Huilotepec Decorated vessels. The paste is gray and has a hard, dense tex- ture. The surface is polished. Manufacturing techniques. The surface is so well polished and the relief of the features so low, that it cannot be decided whether the heads are mold-made or hand shaped. The heads are hollow and multi- layered. Aesthetic appearance. The rotundity of the faces results in a somewhat grotesque expression. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The heads are egg-shaped. The faces are pinched and the chins recede. All facial contours are soft. The eyes and mouths are represented by shallow gouges. The ears are indicated by two low swellings. The foreheads are sloping and the skulls suggest artificial deformation. Dimensions. The faces average 5.75 cm. in length. Chronological position. On the basis of the paste and surface finish, we relate this type to the Xuku phase or Early Classic period. Site occurrence. Lieza, surface. Anthropomorphic Hollow Vessel Support (Fig. 75i) Paste and surface finish. The outer layer is made of a chalky, soft, cinnamon-colored clay containing numerous large reddish particles. The interior is made of a fine, gray, hard clay. Manutfacturing technique. Mold-made. Aesthetic appearance. The head has bold, heavy features represented in low relief. Stylistic rendering of anatomical features. The head is elongated and tapers toward the chin, which termi- nates in a goatee. The face is broad. The eyes are oval to tear-drop shaped. The nose is short and well shaped. The mouth is unusually large with thick parted lips. The cheekbones are prominent and rounded. The ears are shown by two crescent-shaped swellings. Custouiis. The figure wears a goatee. Dimensions. The head measures 5 cm. Chroniological position. The paste suggests a Late Classic assignment. Site occurrence. Tehuantepec, surface. MISCELLANEOUS Unspecified (fig. 75j). This fragment is made of a medium coarse tempered paste; its surface is care- fully smoothed. It was probably red-painted. Both the head and the body seem to have been shaped from a single lump of clay. The facial features are indicated by filleting, incising, and punctating. A bow-like orna- ment is shown on the chest. The face is 2.6 cm. long. This fragment was found in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Clothed torso of a pregnant woman (fig. 75k). This figure wears a cardigan-like coat with short sleeves and a skirt. The incised lines arranged according to a pat- tern suggest that the coat is made of several pieces sewn together. The figurine is painted with red hema- tite. Hollow hand (fig. 751). Its size suggests that it was part of a large figurine. It is made of a fine-grained paste. It was found at Lieza. Leg of a seated figurine (fig. 75m). The figure wears an apron. The surface is coated with a reddish- orange slip. It was found in a Tixumn or Classic level at Lieza (table 1). Limbs of articulated figurines (fig. 75n, o). One arm was found on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec, and one leg in a Tixum level at Lieza (table 1). Headless figurine with splayed base (fig. 76a; table 1). The paste contains unevenly sized particles ranging from fine to very coarse. The figurine is crudely fash- ioned. The outstretched arms were pinched out of the body and their extremities folded back and incised to indicate the digits. Welding marks in front of the base suggest that legs made of rods of clay were crossed in front of the abdomen. It was found at Lieza in an Ulam level. Legless torso with breech-clout (fig. 76b). This figurine represents a legless man. The body is short and stocky, the arms, conical stumps. It was found at Boca del Rio in a Xuku or Early Classic level (table 3). ZOOMORPHIC FIGURINES Representations of animals were found in small quantities only in Postclassic levels in our excavations. Deer head (fig. 76d). It is made of fine paste. The head was hand-shaped and the features added by fillet- ing. The surface is painted red. This head was found at Lieza (table 1). Jaguar head (fig. 76e). It served as a knob on a lid. It was made of a fine-grained paste and is painted red. It was found at Lieza (table 1). Mold-made hollow jaguar head (fig. 76f). The paste is cream colored and is heavily tempered with very fine sand. The facial features are blurred. It was found at Ileza on the surface. Mold-made coatimondi head (tlacuache) (fig. 76g).

The surface is white-slipped and the pupils of the eyes are painted red. The head and body are shaped from a single rod of clay. The head ornament, arms, and legs are made by filleting. The eyes are made of thin disks of clay with circular impressions. The one remaining leg is short and terminates in a forked foot. There is a vertical hole between the legs to fix the figure on a stick. It was found on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Mold-made slab jaguar face (fig. 76j). In paste and manufacturing technique it is identical to the Mayoid Mold-made Slab figurines. It was found on the surface at Lieza. Coatimondi (fig. 76k). Monoceramic figurine found on the surface at Boca del Rio. The arms, eyes, and</page><page sequence="134">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 CLAY ARTIFACTS 135 ears are made by filleting. The paste is silty. The neck is drilled transversely for suspension. Turtle (fig. 761). It is hollow and made of un- tempered paste. It cannot be decided whether it was hand-shaped or mold-made. It was found near Tehuantepec. Fig. 76m illustrates a fragment of a quadruped made of fine-grained paste found on the surface at Lieza. Its shape and back suggest an armadillo. CLAY ARTIFACTS Clay artifacts recovered in our excavations were relatively scarce. Whistles and Ocarinas Most of the pieces under consideration are surface finds. Few fragments were found in our excavations and only in Classic levels. Bird effigies (fig. 77a, b; table 1). The ocarina in figure 77a was found at Lieza in the Late Tixum sub- phase. It is made of a fine-grained paste. Its surface was slipped or painted. The tail serves as a support and mouthpiece. The eyes and comb are made by filleting. There is a single stop in the chest. The bird-call in figure 77b, which was found in the vicinity of Tehuantepec, has suspension holes in its winlgs. The tail also serves as a mouthpiece. It plays in two different keys. Monkey effigies (fig. 77c, d). Judging from their hard, gray paste, they undoubtedly belong to the Mixteca-Puebla cultural period. Their moutlhpieces are slightly conical. Both heads, found near Tehuan- tepec, are mold-made and filleted. Human effigies (fig. 77e, f). The head in figure 76e, made of fine-grained paste, served as a mouthpiece. It was found in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. The whistle resonator in figure 76f represents an old man wearing a beard. Its elongated skull, now broken off, probably served as a mouthpiece. This whistle has two stops, one on each side of the air vent. Earplugs Tubular earplug (fig. 77g; table 2). This specimen is made of an extremely dense, hard, and untempered clay. The tube, made from a thin slab of clay wrapped around a stick, is polished and coated with a thin red wash. The polish and the red wash are similar to those of the Tlacotepec Decorated pots. It was found in a Niti level at Boca del Rio. Solid earplug (fig. 77h). This pulley-shaped ear- plug was found on the surface near Tehuantepec. Grooved Spherical Balls (Fig. 77i, j; tables 1 and 3) Several were found in our excavations. They usually occur in large numbers on the surface of archaeological sites in the Pacific Plains. They are spherical to slightly ovoid. Drucker (1943a: p. 87) believes that they were used either as loom weights or as net sinkers. They average 1.5 cm. in length. The majority under consideration were found in Tixum levels. Phytosorphic Clay Object (Fig. 77k; table 3) One fragment of a maize ear was found in a Late Tixum level at Boca del Rio, and the fragment illus- trated was found on the surface at Lieza. Both are made of a fine-grained paste. Clay Beads (Fig. 771-n; table 1) Clay beads are rare. The elongated beads in figure 771 and m were found on the surface at Lieza. The spherical bead (fig. 77n) comes from a Late Tixum level at Lieza. Spindle Whorls (Fig. 77o, p; table 3) The first (fig. 77o) is mold-made and was found at Boca del Rio in the Late Tixum sub-phase. The second was found at Lieza on the surface. Both are made of a fine, hard, brittle paste. Stamp-Seals (Fig. 77q, r) The first (fig. 77q) was found on the surface at Boca del Rio. Its design consists of step-and-scroll motifs framed with a row of half-terraces. Originally it had a handle. The design of the semi-spherical seal (fig. 77r) consists of four elliptical holes placed more or less symmetrically on the periphery, and of eight holes placed haphazardly. The latter was found on the surface near Tehuantepec. Candelero ( ?) (Fig. 77s; table 1) The diameter of this small vessel, 2 cm., suggests that we are dealing here with a candelero not unlike those from El Tajin. It was found at Lieza in an Early Tixum level. Adornmenits (Fig. 77t-v; tables 1, 3) All fragments illustrated are from our excavations. One (fig. 77u), found in a Late Tixum sub-phase at Boca del Rio, suggests the handle of a lid similar to those found in the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso and Bernal, 1952: fig. 28a).</page><page sequence="135">136 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

They have been found in all levels. Usually hand-shaped from a small lump of fine- grained clay, they have thick walls and bottoms. Sherds Reworked into Disks (Fig. 78e, f; tables 1-3) They usually occur in Classic levels. They are round with ground edges. None is perforated. They average 4.8 cm. in diameter. Any suitable potsherd could be shaped into a disk. Perforated Sherds (Fig. 78g; tables 1, 3) They occurred occasionally in Classic deposits. They may have been used as spindle whorls. Hand-Shaped Clay Disk (Fig. 78h; table 1) This disk, 7 cm. in diameter, found in a Late Tixum level at Lieza, is crudely hand-modeled. Its edge and center are thickened. Problematical Objects (Fig. 78i, j; tables 1-3) Such objects were found scattered in almost all levels in our excavations. Those illustrated are made of fine-grained paste. Clay Abrader ( ?) (Fig. 78k; table 1) This ovoid lump of silty clay has a flat bottom with striation marks. It was found at Lieza in a Goma level. Bead-like Artifact (Fig. 781) It is hollow and has a narrow opening. It is made of the same paste as that of Jordan Self-Slipped vessels of the Late Tixum sub-phase. It was found on the surface at Lieza. ARTIFACTS OF BONE, SHELL, ETC. Bone spatula (fig. 79a; table 1). It is made from a fragment of mazama deer bone. The working end is slightly rounded and flattened. The handle end shows sawing marks on both sides. It is 6.2 cm. long. Polisher or groover (fig. 79f; table 2). It seems likely that this tool, made from a shell columella, was picked up on the beach, brought back to camp, and used as a polisher or groover. Both ends are perfectly rounded and smoothed. It is 10.7 cm. long, and was found at Boca del Rio in a Xuku level. Olivella tinklers (fig. 79b, c; table 2). Despite the proximity of the sea to Boca del Rio and Lieza, shell tinklers were extremely rare in our excavations. Two were found on the surface at the Lieza site, and five in Kuak and Niti levels at Boca del Rio. The perforation for suspension is either drilled (fig. 79b) or cut (fig. 79c). Pearl (fig. 79d). This large, irregularly shaped pearl measures 18 mm. in diameter. It was found on the surface at the Pixana site on the outskirts of Tehuantepec, which is assigned to the Mixteca-Puebla culture. Lobster claw (fig. 79e). It exhibits sawing marks at both ends. Its exterior surface and edges were smoothed down. It was found at the Pixana site. STONE TOOLS An extremely small number of fragmentary or com- plete stone tools was recovered in our excavations. Only sixty-three have been positively identified as being implements. The most common were milling stones, grinders, hammerstones, and blades. Obsidian, conspicuously absent during the Late For- mative and Protoclassic Periods, has an ephemeral existence. It appears at the beginning of the Xuku phase in the form of a few fragments of prismatic blades and disappears during the following Tixum phase. Obsidian blades occur in moderate quantities along with Mixteca-Puebla cultural material in Late Postclassic sites. The lack of exploitable outcroppings of obsidian in the southern and central divisions of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and failure to bring some into the area through trade, may account for the absence of this material during the Late Formative and Late Classic Periods. The prehistoric knappers re- sourcefully fell back on the local rocks, especially quartz and quartzite, and occasionally on any of the fine meta- morphic rocks such as chalcedony, granite, rhyolite, sandstone, jasper, etc., which abound in the south- isthmic region. During the Late Formative quartz prevails, during the Classic and Postclassic, quartzite. Quartz, quartzite, and chalcedony cores, flakes, and rejects occur in al- most every level of our stratigraphic pits. Diorite was usually shaped into celts. The prehistoric men also availed themselves of the natural shapes of pebbles and small boulders in using them as mullers and grinding stones. They particularly favored small, flat kidney- shaped pebbles and spherical stone balls, both of which were found in variable quantities in our excavations. Grinding stones and mullers are unusually small and occur in extremely small numbers. Only two fragments of milling stones large enough to grind maize were found.</page><page sequence="137">138 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

The art of flaking made slow progress during the Late Formative and Classic stages. The lithic industry does not reflect the cultural changes which are seen in the pottery. The only noticeable change concerns the direction of the blows that detached the flakes from nodules. During the Late Formative the blows were delivered at a right angle to the widest plane and per- pendicular to the narrowest plane of the nodules (fig. 80i). In Classic times the blows were delivered on one corner of large quadrangular nodules and directed to- ward the center of the nodules (fig. 80k, 1). The Classic blades are curved and have one sharp edge need- ing little or no retouching. THE GOMA PHASE The quartz chips and flakes are much smaller than those of quartzite. Most quartz cores exhibit irregular cleavage planes. Milk quartz prevails. Cores, nodules, and rejects of quartzite occur in smaller numbers than those of quartz. Unworked pebbles and nodules are always associated with flakes, chips, and cores. Other rocks were found in low frequency.</page><page sequence="138">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] STONE TOOLS 139 ;S~~~~X -S.7-~~~~~ 1 ? 2_ 3 4 cm s cale FIG. 79.

The following tools, implements, and rej ects have been recorded for the Goma phase: Quartzite cores (fig. 80a, b; table 2). These two cores, from Boca del Rio, show good control in detach- ing blades. Chalcedony flakes (fig. 80f, g; table 1). Both flakes have voluminous bulbs of percussion. Quartzite choppers (fig. 80h, i; tables 1 and 2). They are fairly thick; their working edges are crudely retouched. Quartz point (fig. 80o; table 3). We are still un- decided as to whether or not this specimen was inten- tionally chipped. The chipping is crude. Hammerstone or pounder (fig. 81a; table 3). This is a naturally shaped cobble of limestone. Small round grinding stone (fig. 81e; table 2). It is made of granite and has a well-defined circular shallow trough. It may have been used to grind hematite. "Kidney" stones (fig. 81g; tables 1-3). They are flat and naturally shaped. We found them in every level of our excavations. Small flat muller (fig. 81k; table 2). This is a naturally shaped flat quartzite pebble which was used to grind hematite. Its surfaces are covered with it. Arrow-shaft polisher (?) (fig. 811; table 2). It is made of weathered limestone and has a groove running along its narrower edge. Pumice abrader (fig. 82i; table 2). This fragment, originally about 10 cm. long, is shaped like a muller. THE KUAK PHASE The lithic industry continues into the Kuak phase without any noticeable changes. Quartz cores and re- jects maintain their numerical superiority over those of quartzite, though in much smaller quantities than during the Goma phase. The following artifacts pertaining to the Kuak phase have been identified: Quartzite core (fig. 80c; table 3). This polyhedrical core suggests good control in detaching blades. Quartz cores (fig. 80d, e; table 2). These cores have irregular cleavage planes. Quartzite blade (fig. 80j; table 2). The lower edge of this thin blade, made of extremely fine-grained quartzite, is sharp and necessitated no additional flaking or retouching. Grounid celt (not illustrated; table 2). This celt made of diorite was 7.5 cm. long and had an oval to round section. Unfortunately it was lost before it could be drawn for illustration. Large muliler (not illustrated; table 1). This frag- ment of a very large and thick muller would attest to the grinding of maize during the Kuak phase. Lumps of pumice stone, small flat naturally shaped mullers, "kidney" stones, stone balls, and nondescript choppers were found throughout the Kuak cultural deposits. THE NITI PHASE During the Niti phase reliance on quartz is still greater than on quartzite. The only artifact idei-tified is the end of a small muller. Chunks of lime were also found scattered in the Niti levels. THE XUKU PHASE The appearance of fragments of obsidian blades heralds a new era. During the Xuku phase the pre- historic Tehuano knappers almost gave up making</page><page sequence="139">140 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.

No quartz cores or rej ects were found in the Xuku deposits at Lieza; a few were found at Boca del Rio. No obsidian polyhedral core has been found in our excavations. The only known obsidian core was found on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Obsidian is scarce at Lieza and Boca del Rio. Quartzite tools are the most common and are somewhat smaller than those of the Late Formative. The blades are usually detached from quadrangular cobbles. The blows were delivered on the corners of the cobble. The Xuku stone artifacts identified are as follows: Quartzite blade (fig. 80m; table 3). It was struck from a boat-shaped nodule. It has a sharp edge. Sev- eral similar blades were found in our excavations. Polisher (fig. 81d; table 1). This small polisher made of colored quartz was probably used to burnish or polish the surfaces of pots. It bears long facetted- like curved planes. Muller (fig. 81f; table 1). It is made of granite and has an ellipsoid section. Small square grinding stone (fig. 81n; table 2). It is made of a slab of limestone and was used without re- quiring additional improvements. Milling stone (not illustrated; table 2). The only unquestionable evidence of possible maize grinding is suggested by two fragments of a milling stone. We estimate its original length to be 33 cm. Though small, it would fit any of the small mullers. The two frag- ments were found near Burial 4 in Stratigraphic Pit Bi at Boca del Rio. Pumice abrader (not illustrated; table 2). It con- sists of a small pumice stone with one flat side. Polished celt (not illustrated; table 1). Only the bit</page><page sequence="142">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 STONE SCULPTURES 143 of the blade was recovered. It is made of fine-grained diorite. THE TIXUM PHASE Few blade fragments of obsidian have been recovered in Tixum levels. They completely disappear at the close of this phase. The majority of tools are made of quartzite. Quartz was occasionally used at Boca del Rio, but not at Lieza. The hunters also experimented with new fine-grained rocks such as jasper and por- phyry. The following artifacts have been identified: Quartzite blades (fig. 80k, 1; table 1). They are relatively thin. Polisher (fig. 81c; table 2). It is made of jasper and has a very slightly curved surface. The handle end was at one time used as a hammer. Three-qutarter groove maul (fig. 82d; table 3). This granite maul has a polished groove. The remaining stone artifacts include "kidney" stones, (fig. 81h), stone balls, and fragments of small mullers. THE ULAM PHASE Although obsidian has been found at sites related to the Mixteca-Puebla culture, none was recorded in our excavations in Ulam levels. Quartz is almost absent, whereas quartzite continues to prevail. Artifacts to which a specific use can be ascribed are few: Hammerstone (fig. 81b; table 1). This is a naturally shaped small boulder of quartzite. It also served as an anvil. Grinders or small mullers (fig. 81i, j; table 1). They are naturally shaped small pebbles. Grinding stone (fig. 81m; table 1). It is made of a small, round sandstone slab. Both sides were used. SURFACE FINDS Texcoco point (fig. 80n). The edges are retouched and finely serrated. It is made of chalcedony. It was identified by Paul Tolstoy, who assigns it to the Aztec III (possibly II) Period. Ground celts (fig. 82a-c). The three specimens il- lustrated are made of diorite, and were found in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. Netsinkers (fig. 82e-g). A hoard of 58 specimens was found on the surface at the Lieza site several years ago. They average 4.3 cm. in height. They are naturally shaped pebbles of conglomerate and have a groove pecked around their narrowest sections. Loom weight or net sinker (fig. 82h). This well- polished weight or sinker of limestone is similar to those of clay illustrated in figure 77i and j. MINERAL PIGMENTS (Tables 1-3) Various-sized chunks of hematite, specular hematite, and limonite have been recorded in almost all phases, especially in the Goma and Late Tixum sub-phase. STONE SCULPTURES Finds of stone sculptures have occasionally been re- ported for the south-isthmic area. None were found in our excavations. Axe-head (fig. 83a). Only the lower part of this granite head is preserved. It was found on the slopes of Lieza Hill while surveying. Its surface is badly abraded. The features are blocked out in low relief. The granite from which it is carved seems to be of local origin. Wild boar or peccary (fig. 83b). The artist availed himself of the natural shape of a sandstone pebble. The features are carved and incised. One side was partly polished, the other left unfinished. Sculptured stela. In 1806 a "lapida llena de geroglifi- cos" was sent from Tehuantepec to Mexico (de Leon, 1843: p. 248). Its fate is unknown. Statue. A sculpture of a naked woman was found in Tehuantepec early in the eighteenth century. It was smashed to pieces by its finders (de Leon, 1843: p. 248). SMALL STONE CARVINGS All are surface finds from around Tehuantepec, ex- cept for the small cup in figure 84q found at Lieza in a Late Tixum level. Twisted face god (Dios Tuerto) (fig. 84a). This pendant is made of poor quality jade. The right eye, abnormally large and slightly bulging, is indicated by three horizontal cuts, the small blinking eye, by two short cuts. Human figurine (fig. 84b). The face is human, but the short, curled tail would suggest a monkey. It is carved of poor quality jade. Human face (fig. 84c). It is a pendant of serpentine. Jade figurine (fig. 84d). This fragment represents a person in a conventionalized attitude with the hands drawn up to the chest. The features are carved in very low relief. Beads (fig. 84e-m). They are made of a variety of rocks. Cups (fig. 84n-q). They are skillfully made. Seal ( ?) (fig. 84r). We are undecided as to whether or not it was used as a seal. It is made of poor quality jade. Bead (fig. 84s). It is in the form of a canine. Pendant or button (fig. 84t). It was found in a street of Tehuantepec. Problematic object (fig. 84u). It is highly polished. Pendant (fig. 84v). The circular motif is slightly raised. Bead (fig. 84w). This unfinished bead has one conical perforation at each end. Nose ornaments (fig. 84x, y). They are finely chipped.</page><page sequence="143">144 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. 5 ~~~10 a~~~ p cm scale b FIG. 83. Stone sculptures. a. axe-head, surface, Lieza Hill. b. peccary or wild boar made of sandstone, surface, vicinity of Tehuantepec. COPPER ARTIFACTS The artifacts discussed below were all found around Tehuantepec. Copper axe-money (fig. 85a). The 17 specimens at the American Museum of Natural History have a cross- bow shape, and each is made of a single thin sheet of copper. The stems or handles taper slightly toward their ends. The bars have rounded tips. The edges of the stems and the lower edges of the bars were hammered flat, presumably to give the axes some rigid- ity. The axes vary between 12 and 14 cm. in length, 15 and 17 cm. in width, and % and 3/4 mm. in thickness. Each axe is of even thickness, and none shows marks of hammering. This observation led Dupaix to believe that they had been cast in a mold (Dupaix, 1834: p. 21). They were found in a jar containing several dozen others near the road leading from Tehuantepec to Juchit'an. They differ from those of the Valley of Oaxaca which have crescent-shaped bilobate blades and much shorter stems. Copper axes were used as cur- rency. Ring (fig. 85b). It is made from a single piece of wire. Its ends are hammered together. Unperforated needle (fig. 85c). Its cross-section is lozenge shaped. The working end was hammered into a point; the other end is cut flat. Perforated needle (fig. 85d). We estimate its origi- nal length to have been 10.5 cm. The eye was cut or incised from each side of the flattened end. Fishhook (fig. 85e). It was fashioned from a thin and narrow piece of copper. The end of the loop, meant for attaching the line, was hammered onto the shaft. SIGNIFICANT TRAITS AND THEIR POSSI- BLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE OF OTHER MESOAMERICAN ASSEMBLAGES The purpose of this section is to indicate the signifi- cant culture traits which we believe characterize each culture phase of the Tehuantepec region, and to corre- late them, whenever possible, with similar or identical</page><page sequence="144">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 SIGNIFICANT TRAITS 145 a~~~~~~~~~~~~ I/7Zc d H.f m p~~~~~~~~~ 0~~~~~~~ o3 2 3 4 5 ww x Y cm scale FIG. 84.

Sometimes we correlated traits of the Tehuan- tepec region with those of earlier phases of other areas to emphasize the presence of these traits in contexts earlier than those of Tehuantepec. Our cross-cultural comparisons are based on a thorough, though not ex- haustive review of the existing literature. Moreover, we wish to emphasize that we are interested more in the appearance of new traits than in their persistence, and that we do not deal with absent traits. We are particularly concerned with significant ce- ramic traits which archaeologists call modes. "A mode . . .becomes the term designating a ceramic attribute (or collectively a small group of inseparable attributes) that have been observed to have singular import and meaning beyond that of any purely descriptive aspect because it appears in several or a number of different varieties (of different types) remaining all the while unaltered in its own essential characteristic. A mode . . . is an attribute or cluster of attributes that displays significance of its own right" (Smith, Willey, and Gif- ford, 1960: p. 331). Ceramic modes are particularly well suited for tracing cultural relationships over large areas. While ceramic types are confined usually to restricted areas, modes have a wider distribution which can be plotted on maps. We shall now enumerate these traits and modes, and their parallels as found in other cultural contexts of Mesoamerica. THE GOMA PHASE Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified, figures 25v, 26i. Comparative material: one Radani Gray jar, small, incised, with hemispherical lower body, insloping upper walls, and cylindrical neck, was found in a Monte Alban I ceramic complex at Camotlan in the Mixe area. This jar is in the possession of Howard Leigh, Mitla, Mexico. Ovate bowl. Pixixi Daub: Pixixi Variety, figure 22. Comparative material: Tlatilco (Pifia Chan, 1958: 1: fig. 40j, r, pl. 21-6); ovate bowls are generally low and have red polished interiors. El Arbolillo, El Arbo- lillo I or early Middle Formative (Vaillant, 1935: fig. 21-4); they are made of Russet Ware. Zacatenco, Middle Period or late Middle Formative ( ?) (Vaillant, 1930: p. 41, pl.

A slab of clay is welded down to the interior top of the body of the vessels. The rims are no longer built up by coiling. Vessels *tth annular bases. Radani Gray: Varieties Unspecified, figure 25c'. Vessels with annular bases have an early start at Tlatilco and La Venta in the Middle Formative Period. Composite or S-Z angle bowls decorated with deep V-shaped incised lines.

Comparative material: La Venta, Mounds A-1-f and A-3 (Drucker, Heizer, and Squier, 1959: pp. 56-57, and 116-117); they were filled with red and yellow clays, and, like the basins in Pit B1 at Boca del Rio, they seem to have served no purpose. Low rectangular ceremonial platforms. Pit B1, Boca del Rio. Such platforms occur over a wide area in Mesoamerica in the Late Formative Period.

SUMMARY The foregoing section which enumerated the salient features of each culture phase of the Tehuantepec area provides a fairly reliable, though incomplete body of data. On the basis of these data we shall now attempt not only to reconstruct the cultural history of this area, but also to draw some conclusions as to its origins and the cultural continuities, replacements, and linkages. Our frame of reference derived from archaeological evidence and comparative studies has been supple- mented, especially with regard to the Postclassic Period, with information drawn from historical sources and elicited from surface finds. In dating the cultural phases, we were forced to rely entirely on cross-cultural correspondences. We had to line up the Tehuantepec phases with those of other areas. In the absence of adequate charcoal samples, absolute dating by the radiocarbon-14 method was not possible. In a recent monograph, Coe (1961) rearranges the Formative chronology with the help of plausible radio- carbon dates and discusses the significant features of each stage in the light of recent studies. Lest we be accused of redundancy, the following section will be centered on the cultural history of the Tehuantepec region. We refer the reader to Coe's work for a com- plete discussion of the cultural chronology of the Formative Period. As yet no archaeological site affiliated with the Early Formative culture has been found in the south-isthmic area. The chances are that their remains are now either covered by several feet of alluvium or have been washed away by the annual floods. The earliest certain evidence of the presence of man during the Middle Formative Period was presented by Delgado (1961). It was found at Laguna Zope near Juchit'an. The cultural remains recovered in the lower strata compare with those of Chiapa de Corzo, Period II or Dili phase, which is dated at about 850 B.C. The Tehuantepec or western south-isthmic region with which we are concerned lies within the meandering belt of the Tehuantepec River. In the past this river has shifted its bed several times back and forth from the sea to the Upper Lagoon. During these periods of meandering the river probably swept away most of the remains which might have been there. The Late Formative horizon is the time of the earliest human activities so far recorded by us in the Tehuantepec area. Much more spade work is necessary before a more representative body of data is obtained, allowing us to probe deeper into man's past. Ecological and zoological studies have demonstrated that in Pre-formative times the Isthmus of Tehuan- tepec enjoyed tropical climatic conditions throughout the last glaciation and so was spared the harsh climatic changes and drastic biotic shifts which occurred in the Mexican highlands and other parts of North America. Fauna, flora, and climate were virtually unchanged throughout the glacial period. If man arrived in the New World prior to the glaciation peak, as we now have good reason to believe that he did (Krieger, 1962), we can infer that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec would have provided an ideal haven for his survival during the last glaciation. The Isthmus of Tehuan- tepec should offer a promising field of investigation, and the possibility of finding clues that would aid in solving the problem of early man in the New World should not be disregarded. We infer from the archaeological evidence and the study of past land features that at least a part of man's activities in the Formative Period was probably con- ditioned by the natural environment, especially by the annual floods. Rivers overflowed their banks as they do today, and as a result large tracts of land were temporarily inundated. The sea and the lagoons ex- tended farther inland, and the area was dotted with brackish ponds, lakes, canals and studded with hills, hillocks, and river levees. The distribution of the known Formative sites indi- cates that the population was probably scattered around</page><page sequence="153">154 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. the wide sweep of the lagoon system which provided good fishing grounds. Of five certainly known Forma- tive sites, three, Lieza, Laguna Zope, and Los Tepal- cates may have been settled the year round. Boca del Rio and Pixixi, which now consist of remnants of river levees and lie on lower ground, may have been abandoned occasionally during severe flood conditions. It is probable that some sort of short-distance seasonal migration was practiced prior to settling permanently at Boca del Rio and Pixixi in Kuak times. The people could have spent the dry season on the levees, and then for the rainy season they could have repaired to higher ground, perhaps joining relatives at Lieza or Juchitan. During the dry season they probably derived their livelihood principally from the lagoons, by collecting clams, mussels, and shrimp, fishing, and hunting small game and turtles. It can be assumed that they supple- mented their daily fare with stored produce grown during the rainy season. From our knowledge of cur- rent climatic conditions and on the assumption that no shift in the rain pattern occurred during the past two thousand years, we can infer that growing corn must have often been a gamble. Crop failures resulting from an insufficiency of rain are not uncommon- nowadays in the Tehuantepec region. THE GOMA PHASE In assessing the significant elements of the Goma phase, we could not escape from the impression that it might represent the ultimate expression of the Middle Formative Period with which it shares many diagnostic features. This inference seems quite acceptable in view of the fact that a Middle Formative tradition flourished at Juchit'an and that a sizable body of elements appar- ently lingered on into the Late Formative. Since "it is the appearance of new forms and not the persistence of old ones that is the significant factor" (Leakey, 1953: p. 18), we unhesitatingly ascribed the Goma phase to the Late Formative Period. The Goma phase is placed in time roughly between 300 and 100 B.C. Several cultural traits which occur with a fairly high frequency in Mesoamerican Middle Formative assem- blages are also shared by the Goma phase. Red-filled incising which decorates Lieza Self-Slipped: Pilas Vari- ety vessels has a long history in Mesoamerica and occurs in Lower Tlatilco, Lower El Arbolillo I, and the Conchas phase at La Victoria. It also appeared in Late Formative contexts at Finca Arizona, Guatemala, and at Tres Zapotes. White-rimmed black ware represented in the Tehuantepec region by the Guizi Black-and- White type makes its appearance during the Middle Formative Period at Tlatilco and La Venta. The con- tinuity of this tradition, namely, the decoration of black vessels by means of a special firing technique, is also attested to in Late Formative sites in Veracruz and in the Central Depression of Chiapas. In the last state, at Chiapa de Corzo, it is equated with Period V or Late Preclassic C 250 B.C.). The Lieza Self-Slipped jars with notched fillets show affinities with those of the Conchas Red Unburnished type found at La Victoria in the Conchas phase or Middle Formative. Among some typical Middle Formative pottery shapes that persisted into the Late Formative of the Tehuantepec area, we noticed the jar with insloping straight walls with or without slight rim eversion and round bottoms. Similarly shaped jars are known from Zacatenco, Mid- dle Period. This shape has also been identified in Late Formative assemblages from Teotihuacan, Period I, and San Agustin, Chiapas. The jar with the unbridged spout provides a tenuous link between the Gomna phase and both Playa de los Muertos I and Mamon. One spout belonging to the Radani Gray type tends to sup- port this relationship. Certain decorative elements of the Middle Formative, particularly straight or curvi- linear incised multi-parallel lines, bear resemblances to those of Chiapa de Corzo, Period IV or Late Preclassic B (400 B.C.). Further correspondences between the Goma phase and the Middle Formative horizon are provided by vessels with two slips, each of a different color, applied to two separate areas. Tilema Dichrome shares this feature with vessels from La Victoria (Conchas phase), Chiapa de Corzo (Period II or Mid- dle Preclassic), Rio Blanco, Chiapas, and Kamiinal- juyu. Tilema Dichrome also establishes the contempo- raneity of the Goma phase with Late Formative sites in Veracruz such as El Trapiche, Tres Zapotes, and with those of the Nautla River basin. The evidence implies that many ceramic characteris- tics of the Goma phase have their roots in the Middle Formative horizon. It also indicates a certain stability in the ceramic traditions of the Tehuantepec area. External cultural influences to which the Tehuantepec region was subjected during the Late Formative did not generally affect ceramics too much, although major changes took place in other aspects of the culture. Pottery-making remained a stable complex with the exception of one of its components, Radani Gray, which followed its own line of evolution. This line led to an extremely large number of variations in Kuak times. The majority of the Goma ceramics are unelaborated. Decoration is incidental and the repertory of designs limited. From the point of view of its ceramics, the Goma phase could be thought of as the terminal phase of a cultural stage which had passed its peak of excel- lence. It seems to initiate a period of slow and steady decline in craftsmanship. Firing techniques are gener- ally poorly controlled except for Radani Gray and Guizi Black-and-White. In the latter type the white rim was achieved by employing a special firing tech- nique. Radani Gray was a mass-produced ware of outstanding quality, probably made for export. It is possible that a single family or a small segment of the population of the south-isthmic region could have spe-</page><page sequence="154">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] SUMMARY 155 cialized in manufacturing it. The only evidence avail- able on the distance to which it was exported comes from Camotlan, in the Mixe area, which lies about 90 km. northwest of Tehuantepec (fig. 2). One nearly complete incised jar with hemispherical lower body and insloping upper walls and cylindrical neck was found there in a Monte Alb'an I ceramic assemblage. Accord- ing to its owner, Howard Leigh, of Mitla, Mexico, an expert on Monte Alban ceramics, this jar does not belong to the Monte Alb'an ceramic tradition. The presence of Radani Gray in a Monte Alb'an I context suggests that this type was already manufactured in Middle Formative times. The numerous variations in shapes within this type, as recorded in the Tehuantepec region, further suggest that we must search somewhere in the south-isthmic region for its center of production. This suggestion falls into line with our view that, the greater the distance from the center of production, the fewer will be the number of possible variations. An- other significant problem raised by Dr. Bernal is that of cultural relationships between the Tehuantepec re- gion, possibly the whole south-isthmic area, and the Valley of Oaxaca. Dr. Bernal, who kindly examined the Tehuantepec Formative wares, denies any close relationships between these and Monte Alb'an wares. Beyond doubt the Sierra Madre provided a deterrent to normal cultural communication and reduced diffusion to a trickle. We turn now to the Gulf coast area and southern Mexico to establish correlations with Late Formative ceramic complexes. Painted-White-Rim, a minor ware of the Goma phase, is very similar to black bowls with painted white rims from Period V or Late Preclassic C (250 B.C.), Chiapa de Corzo, which were shown to us by Frederick Peterson at the headquarters of the New World Archaeological Foundation in Tuxtla Gutierrez. Among the most ubiquitous and characteristic vessel shapes of the Late Formative are bowls and dishes with short outcurving rims (S-Z angle), bowls or dishes with labial flanges or prominent ridges, and dishes with wide everted grooved rims. The last are rare in the Goma phase and lack the typical red slip of similar Mesoamerican vessels. In the Tehuantepec area, red- slipped dishes with wide, everted, grooved rims appear only in the following Kuak phase. These three shapes unmistakedly place the Goma phase within the Late Formative horizon. Late Formative sites at which one, two, or all three shapes were recorded include La Victoria (Crucero phase), Uaxactun (Upper Chi- canel), Tres Zapotes (Early Tres Zapotes), P'anuco (Panuco II), Kaminaljuyu (Miraflores phase), Chiapa de Corzo (Period V), Champerico (Miraflores phase), Finca Arizona (Late Formative), and even Zacatenco (Late Zacatenco). From the faunal remains it is possible to reconstruct to some extent the subsistence economy during the Goma phase. The evidence indicates that the popula- tion pursued a number of activities such as fishing, collecting mussels, clams, and oysters, catching crabs, and hunting deer and peccaries. Stone implements such as would be used to grind maize are absent. Chipped stone tools were fashioned principally from quartz and quartzite. The source of these rocks and of the mineral pigments which were found in the Goma phase can be traced to the central division of the Isthmus of Tehuan- tepec. Pumice may either have been traded from an as yet undetermined volcanic region, or may have been picked up in the form of floats in the alluvium along the rivers. THE KUAK PHASE The slow isostatic movement which we assume oc- curred in the south-isthmic region caused a gradual rise of the land. Some rivers cut deeper beds, islands were connected to the mainland, and the summits of Boca del Rio and Pixixi rose above the water level throughout the year, providing an area for permanent settlement after the threat of inundation became a mat- ter of speculation rather than a certainty. The data we have show that occupation became permanent at Boca del Rio, while Lieza seems to have been inter- mittently occupied for brief periods of time. We are inclined to believe that the Kuak phase ini- tiated an era of small-scale cooperative projects, prob- ably under the impulse of a newly introduced religious ideology. The construction of ceremonial platforms and the use of censers seem to support this assumption. It seems reasonable to assume that a limited priesthood centered around a formal religion induced the people to accept a new dogma and devote some of their time to erecting a place of worship. The proper performance of the ceremonies called for the burning of copal in the censers. The construction of ceremonial platforms was pre- ceded by the building of shallow basins which were found to contain only clayey earth and seemed to have served no purpose. Pits filled with yellow and red clays have been reported from La Venta and, like the Boca del RIo basins, served no obvious purpose. Basin construction was followed by platform building. Platforms were modest affairs. We assume that a simple wattle-and-daub hut to be used as a shrine was erected on top of the platform. In the course of time, that is, throughout the Kuak and Niti phases, the original platforms were reconstructed at least four, and possibly five times. The builders did not make use of the plentiful supply of boulders which the Tehuantepec River rolls in its bed, but instead built the walls of these platforms with a mixture of gravel and clay, less frequently of sand and clay. The walls were perfectly coursed and well finished. Once dry they attained a remarkable degree of hardness. From our data we conjecture that the platforms were surrounded by clay walks.</page><page sequence="155">156 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Although a platform building may be an indication of some basic changes in social organization, the mate- rial culture, as reflected in the ceramic complex, does not indicate that any profound changes occurred during the Kuak phase. The ceramic complex of the Kuak phase follows the same trend of deterioration as initiated in Goma times. Craftsmanship leaves much to be de- sired except for that of Radani Gray, which reaches its peak of manufacturing skill although showing some deterioration. Never have the manufacturers of Radani Gray been so creative. Rim-lip profiles alone have over seventy variations. Four new ceramic type varie- ties appear in the Kuak phase. Major technical innovations are reflected in polished celts and in the building up of the rims on jars. The relatively late appearance of red-slipped dishes and bowls with wide, everted, grooved rims cannot be accounted for. It seems plausible that it was caused by a lag in the diffusion of this kind of vessels. The Kuak phase seems to correlate with that of Sacatepequez, Guatemala, through the presence at Te- huantepec of a minor ware, Fine-Grained Red-Slipped, which cannot be distinguished from sherds assigned to the Sacatepequez phase. These last are at the Ameri- can Museum of Natural History in New York. The Tehuantepec region has two designs in common with -the Late Formative site of Paso de la Vega, Chiapas, straight parallel lines combined with either rows of punctations or wavy parallel lines. Subsistence was still mainly derived from the lagoons, -and the catch consisted of mussels, clams, oysters, fish, and turtles. Deer were also hunted. Worthy of note is the presence of a fragment of whalebone, which sug- gests that whales were occasionally stranded. Burgoa (1674: 2: p. 402) recalls the fright of some Huaves at the sight of a whale that ran aground near their village in 1648. THE NITI PHASE (PROTOCLASSIC PERIOD ?) Despite the presence of stucco-painted sherds in the ceramic complex and the fact that ceremonial platforms -were built, this phase can hardly be conceptualized as representative of the Protoclassic Period. It should be pointed out that several of the most significant and most -widely distributed Protoclassic features, such as dishes or plates with basal flanges and vessels with mammiform legs, are absent. Stucco-painted ware is one of the cultural elements generally used as a diagnostic element -to identify the Protoclassic Period. Stucco-painted sherds were very uncommon in the Niti phase, and we presume that they were traded into the Tehuantepec region. During the Niti phase pottery-making takes a turn -for the worse. The technique of firing black ware with white rims is almost forgotten. A discontinuation of cultural contact between Tehuantepec and adjacent and outlying areas cannot be invoked to explain this decline in ceramic technique, because several new cultural ele- ments were introduced during this phase. A new tech- nique of incised decoration done with a blade was used only on Radani Gray pots. We are inclined to believe that the deep, narrow V-shaped incisions were produced with obsidian blades, although no such blades were found in this culture phase. It is not improbable that potters who traded Radani Gray ware were in contact with people who exchanged obsidian for pots. The few blades acquired may have been used exclusively for decorating pots. During the Niti phase Atempan Scraped: Atempan Variety, which consists only of huge storage jars, sud- denly becomes prominent. Coincidental with its ap- pearance are three clam species, A nadara esmeralda, A. grandis, and Anomalocardia subrugosa, prompting us to suggest that some migrants from an adjacent area entered the Tehuantepec area. The rapid increase in the number of these jars indicates a growing demand probably resulting from the necessity to store larger quantities of food. Under the influence of Atempan Scraped the wall thickness of all other jars increased substantially. These indications lead us to believe that a new level in food production was reached just prior to the beginning of the Classic Period. The tubular earplug is a trait shared by the Tehuan- tepec area with Zacatenco, El Arbolillo, and Panuco. The Tehuantepec earplug closely resembles the one from Panuco. At Zacatenco and El Arbolillo tubular earplugs were already found in Middle Formative levels. Late Formative traditions seem to have been carried on in the Tehuantepec region until the arrival of the Classic culture wave which almost entirely displaced the local culture. For the time being, our correlation of the Niti phase with the Protoclassic Period is conjectural, as is the length of time during which it flourished, from A.D. 100 to 300. THE XUKU PHASE An apparent break in the continuity of the ceramic tradition separates the Late Formative or Protoclassic from the Early Classic Period. Most Classic wares, which probably evolved outside the south-isthmic re- gion, contrast sharply with those of the preceding phases. Although some Formative ceramic types con- tinue into the Xuku phase for a short time, none could be regarded as a prototype of any of the new Classic types. We can safely suggest that bearers of a new culture settled in the Pacific Plains. The persistence of some characteristic traditions of the Formative into the Early Classic supports the belief that the cultural replacement was not complete. For instance, blade incising, though rare, is typical of the Xuku phase, while the special firing technique used to produce white- rimmed black ware experienced a period of revitaliza-</page><page sequence="156">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 SUMMARY 157 tion. This technique seems not to have been ignored by the new migrants. Tehuantepec Black-and-White is without doubt the offspring of the Formative Guizi Black-and-White and a similar ware brought along by the new settlers. They did not limit the application of the technique exclusively to bowls as did the potters of the Formative Period, but used it for a variety of shapes. So, during the Xuku phase we again find quality vessels with two sharply contrasting colors. We also feel sure that Radani Gray and Dubi Gray have a common origin in the Middle or Late Formative but evolved into two different types. In the course of the Early Classic Period Radani Gray is absorbed by Dubi Gray. The Classic ceramic complex as we find it in our area seems to be primarily derived from the Gulf Coast area of Veracruz. Through recurrent cultural diffu- sions during the Xuku phase Tehuantepec began to lose some of its provincialism, but always remained on the receiving end of the cultural transmissions, or stood slightly off their main current. An interesting and independent figurine tradition began to develop. Figu- rines of Late Classic times have a pleasant, sophisticated aspect, proving that some locally inspired developments were possible. Our survey indicated that the newcomers preferred to settle along the foothills of the Sierra Madre in areas above the flood high-water mark that were not settled previously. The main settlements were probably Lieza, Mixtequilla, Tlacotepec, and site Km. 26.800. Forma- tive sites such as Boca del Rio and Juchit'an continued to be inhabited, probably by descendants of people from the Formative Period who adopted the ways and customs of the intruders, especially the material side of the culture. Although Boca del Rilo and Lieza apparently share the same material culture, the study and interpretation of differences between these two sites may provide the necessary clues for elucidating the problem of the origin of the Huave Indians. The possibility that the south- isthmic area was originally occupied by Huaves who were later driven closer to the borders of the lagoons seems plausible in the light of archaeological evidence. We noted that at Boca del Rio people continued to rely heavily on seafood. At Lieza the virtual absence of shells and the presence of grinding implements suggest that the means of subsistence were derived from agri- culture. One of the most popular jars at Lieza, Huaya- bal Leathery, is virtually absent from Boca del Rio. Finally, the obsidian-non-obsidian ratio at Lieza indi- cates that obsidian was favored over quartz and quart- zite, which occurred in very small quantities. The occurrence of obsidian at Boca del R:io seems incidental. The introduction of obsidian into the Tehuantepec re- gion was an important technological improvement, but it had an ephemeral existence. Fragments of blades attest to their use throughout the Xuku phase and Early Tixum sub-phase. They totally disappear by the end of the Late Tixum sub-phase. It is possible that two ethnic groups, sharing the same basic material culture, lived side by side in the Pacific Plains, each group characterized by its own tool-making technology and each pursuing a somewhat different sub- sistence economy. Some of the new migrants probably settled among the aborigines at Boca del Rio during this phase and buried their dead at the residential site, a practice which was soon discontinued. Good firing control enabled the potters to achieve orange, black, gray, and white wares at will. They knew how to differentiate between clays that contained ferric oxide and those which did not. White paste wares undoubtedly originated in central Veracruz where they were very popular during the Classic Period. Several new functional shapes appear in the Tehuan- tepec region, among others, apaxtles or large basins with straight flaring walls. The Tehuantepec speci- mens proved to be very similar in paste and finish to those from Yagul. One element that Tehuantepec seems to have in common with TeotihuacJan, Monte Alb'an, and Kaminaljuyu is the florero. The validity of our correlation can justly be challenged because the evidence rests on one single rim fragment. A signifi- cant and popular feature of the Classic Period is the tripod vessel which, in Tehuantepec, takes the shape of a simple dish or basin rather than that of a cylindri- cal vessel with a lid. Tripods are so ubiquitous in the Classic horizon that they are of little assistance for correlating phases. This is also true for several deco- rative elements such as the scroll and the double-S figure. One of the decorative elements that the Tehuan- tepec area shares with Uaxactun is the hand-bell out- line. It is probable that such a distinctive element diffused from the Maya area into the Pacific Plains. The stepped haircut on one Coffee Bean Eye figurine indicates that new fashion styles were being adopted. The stepped haircut is a characteristic feature commonly found on Smiling Complex figurines from Central Veracruz and on Maya figurines. Consciousness of sartorial elegance also becomes evident, as attested by wrap-around garments, gowns, quexkenitls, and bon- nets. There are clear indications that the practice of head flattening was introduced during this phase. Figurines exhibiting head deformation contrast with round-headed figurines. Some figurines display a strong degree of persistence of Formative features. The best case for such continuity is the H-III-IV figurine type which bears a strong similarity to the H-III and H-IV types from Zacatenco. The cultural inventory of the Xuku phase, which we correlate tentatively with the Early Classic Period, failed to reveal any of its expected elements, such as cylindrical tripod bowls with slab or hollow rounded legs and lids, and mold-made figurines, which typify this period. Thin orange ware, absent from our exca-</page><page sequence="157">158 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. vations, was supposedly found at Juchit'an. No cere- monial center pertaining to the Classic Period has been identified in the Pacific Plains. We are inclined to conclude that the Classic people who settled in the south-isthmic region introduced a form of classic culture not yet fully developed. We place the beginning of the Xuku phase around A.D. 300 and its end between 500 and 600. THE EARLY TIXUM SUB-PHASE This sub-phase is transitional between the Early Classic and the Late Classic. Once again it seems that direct contact with the exterior diminished and that the descendants of the first Classic migrants had to rely on their own devices and imagination to carry on their inherited traditions. Ceramic decadence is evidenced by poor surface finish, the use of much coarser pastes, and the rapid trans- formation and loss of many decorative elements. On the other hand, new elements such as potstands, spiked censers, negative painting, and strainers were added to the ceramic complex. These new elements are of so infrequent occurrence that they probably were unique trade items. Potstands and spiked censers are known at Chiapa de Corzo as early as Period VIII or Early Classic A (A.D. 200). Negative painted sherds and strainers have been recorded in Early Classic levels at Juchitan. A significant fact that suggests an interruption of large trade or contacts is that obsidian becomes scarcer and disappears by the end of this phase. The Early Tixum sub-phase seems to have spanned a short period of time, perhaps a century or so, from the sixth century A.D. to around A.D. 700. THE LATE TIXUM SUB-PHASE There seems to be a change in the settlement pattern initiating a trend toward larger and perhaps fewer agglomerations. For instance, Tlacotepec, which is transitional between the Late Classic and the Early Postclassic Periods, must have been a center of some importance. Strong external cultural influences are felt through- out this sub-phase. The Early Tixum ceramic complex continues into the Late Tixum sub-phase with some indications of better quality and creativity. Many innovations were accepted, such as molds for making figurines. Some newly imported elements show their foreign origin. The Mayoid Mold-made Slab figurines, which were probably traded in from an adjacent area, display sev- eral alien traits: the slab form of the figurines, the technique of reproducing the facial features, the tall headdress, and the composite earplug. It is worth men- tioning that the use of molds to make figurines did not diminish the modeling of figurines by hand. On the contrary, the latter are more popular than the mold- made examples. Furthermore, only the faces of the figurines were cast, with all the other features modeled by hand. This tradition is still current in Tehuantepec today. Around Christmas and New Year's Day, Zapo- tec women make and sell hundreds of tanguyu with mold-made faces and white and gold painted bodies. Additional relationships between Tehuantepec and outlying cultural areas can be established. Negative painted decoration, consistinig of bands with rows of dots, is identical to that found on Panuco (Period IV) and Teotihuacan pottery. Incised and gouged designs on red-slipped ware, such as that found in Tehuantepec, also occur in Central Veracruz. One small plumbate sherd suggests that trade relationships reached as far as Guatemala. Several new customs also seem to have made their way into the Tehuantepec region. Slashing of the ear helices was also practiced at Cerro de las Mesas. Sev- eral types of artificial head deformation can be identified on figurines. The Mexican pantheon is now repre- sented by at least three gods, Huehueteotl, Cocijo or Tlaloc, and the Twisted Face god (Dios Tuerto). Some artifacts found on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec, which show true affiliation with the Classic Monte Alban culture, have been identified by Dr. Bernal as from Monte Alban IIlb or Late Classic, and are presumed to have been imported. Their pro- venience remains in doubt. They could have originated somewhere in the Pochutla area west of Tehuantepec; according to Dr. Bernal, they are definitely not fron the Valley of Oaxaca. On the basis of the clear cultural linkages between the Tehuantepec region and the Valley of Mexico, coastal Guatemala, the Monte Alb'an culture area, and principally with the Maya area, we assign the Late Tixum sub-phase to the Late Classic Period. We can- not establish the end of the Late Tixum sub-phase because we do not know when the Toltec influences began to be felt. As no Early Postclassic material related to the early Toltec horizon has been positively identified in our excavations, we can only conjecture that the Late Classic Period lingered on for some time in the Tehuantepec area through part of the Early Postclassic. THE ULAM OR POSTCLASSIC PERIOD Pottery types belonging to several Postclassic stages or horizons have been found in the Ulam levels. A few types which we have sorted out show clear cultural affiliations with Postclassic cultural stages; others sug- gest cultural continuity from the Late Classic to the Postclassic. As we have already pointed out, the Post- classic strata in our excavations were mixed. On the basis of our excavated material and surface finds we nevertheless subdivided the Postclassic into four cul- tural horizons: Toltec, Mixteca-Puebla, Aztec, and</page><page sequence="158">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 19671 CONCLUSIONS AND PROBLEMS 159 Historic Zapotec. The beginning of each culture hori- zon cannot be dated. We suggest the following time placement for each horizon: Toltec, A.D. 900 ( ?) to 1300; Mixteca-Puebla, 1300-1450; Aztec, 1450-1487; and Historic Zapotec, 1487-1522. The Toltec culture horizon.. If Ixtlixochitl's infor- mation on Toltec migrations is trustworthy, the people associated with the Toltec artifacts found in the Te- huantepec area might have been the refugees who fled after the destruction of Tula in 1168. One ceramic type, Ya Black-on-Red, is probably related to Negro Sobre Caoba from Central Veracruz, a type related to the Toltec ceramics. Mazapan figurines found on the surface in the vicinity of Tehuantepec, and the Teoti- huacanoid Mold-made figurines which are stylistically related to those of the Toltec culture, provide further evidence of a Toltec influence or penetration in the Pacific Plains. The Mixteca-Puebla culture horizon. Four sites presumably Mixteca-Puebla in affiliation are Guiengola, Rancho Laguna, Santa Teresa, and Tehuantepec. The first three are ceremonial centers surrounded by resi- dential areas. Santa Teresa and Tehuantepec yielded a great amount of Mixteca pottery of the Reu Silty type, especially fragments of gray fired bowls with long hollow legs with ends of mold-made jaguars, snakes, or raptorial bird heads. Most of the Mixteca ware seems to be of local origin. Obsidian and polished celts are fairly common at Santa Teresa. The presence of obsidian attests to long-distance trade relations. The bearers of the Mixteca-Puebla culture settled all areas of the Pacific Plains, especially on high ground along the foothills of the Sierra Madre and on or close to the seashore and shores of the lagoons. The Aztec culture horizon. Historical sources refer repeatedly to Mexica-Culhua military and trade expedi- tions on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Aztec cultural penetration in the Tehuantepec region was revealed by one Texcoco chipped stone point which dates apparently from the Aztec III Period (Tolstoy, personal commu- nication; 1962: p. 18 and fig. 3p). This point was found on the surface near Tehuantepec. Texcoco points are found in Aztec II contexts in the Valley of Mexico. The historic Zapotec. According to the Mexican records, the Zapotec moved into the Tehuantepec region around 1487 after having routed the Mexica-Culhua troups and having driven the Huaves out of Tehuan- tepec. CONCLUSIONS AND PROBLEMS We shall now discuss briefly a few of the problems which will need further consideration in the future to enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the Pacific Plains as seen from an archaeological point of view. We shall also compare some of our initial goals which we outlined at the beginning of our study with the results achieved. 1. The information at hand demonstrates that the Pacific Plains area, although playing a marginal role, was in contact with the major centers of Mexico and Guatemala from Middle Formative times to the Con- quest. The cultures of the Pacific Plains did not remain immune to the culture changes that occurred and affected other areas in Mesoamerica. They fol- lowed the general pattern of Mesoamerican cultural development. The Pacific Plains shared with most of the investigated Mesoamerican sites many of the basic and diagnostic elements of each culture period. We doubt whether they were the cradle of significant inno- vations. Apparently no culture center rose in this region to exert an influence on Mesoamerican cultures or to modify the trend of culture development. 2. The 1960 field trip was organized with a view to finding new basic parallels between Mesoamerica and South America. We failed to make such finds. The only relationships we succeeded in tracing were between various parts of Mesoamerica and the Tehuantepec area. In this respect we wish to re-emphasize the importance of a link between two Mesoamerican areas to which attention has recently been drawn. Lowe (1959a: p. 7) observed that articulated figurines abound in Late Formative deposits at Juchit'an and in El Salvador to a greater extent than in any other areas of Meso- america. The appearance of articulated figurines which involve their assemblage from pre-fabricated parts has been assigned to the Early Classic Period. Because of their discovery on such an unexpectedly early time level at Juchit'an and in El Salvador, it would be ad- visable to study the diffusion of this special manufac- turing technique and to search for its origin in Forma- tive times. This problem has a direct bearing on migrations and diffusion of cultures along the Pacific coast from Mesoamerica southward. 3. The full archaeological potentialities of the Pacific Plains have yet to be assessed. In our opinion there are three areas which, if investigated, may furnish the additional data we need to complete the archaeologi- cal picture of the Pacific Plains: Guiengola, Juchit'an, and the Huave area. Three trips to Guiengola, the Postclassic ceremonial center built sixteen kilometers west of Tehuantepec, convinced us that it covers an area far in excess of what has been reported in the literature. Moreover, it also includes a secondary cere- monial center and a residential area which consisted of hundreds of houses. We observed that two periods of construction, and possibly three, were required to com- plete the site. A brief investigation of Guiengola should clarify such problems as the time of its foundation and the cultural affiliation of its builders. Also worth re- investigating is Juchit'an. This archaeological zone apparently comprises the highest density of Formative sites of the whole south-isthmic region. Excavations by Delgado at Laguna Zope yielded a blurred stratigraphy but proved the presence of Middle Formative deposits</page><page sequence="159">160 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. with elements affiliated with the Olmec culture. Known Middle Formative sites with Olmec elements are ex- tremely rare outside the Olmec heartland. Therefore, Juchitan should be tested again. It is not impossible that an intensive survey will disclose evidence of an Early Formative occupation in the Juchit'an as well as in the Huave area. We are aware that the ecological conditions of the Pacific Plains do not quite match those of Soconusco, where Early Formative sites such as La Victoria and Salinas-La Blanca are located. The ancient inhabitants of La Victoria could rely on a stable food supply derived from both the lagoons and the till- ing of extremely fertile plots of ground that produced three harvests of corn a year. Less favorable ecological conditions in the south-isthmic area prohibited intensive food production and rendered livelihood more hazard- ous. Still, a population with a subsistence economy oriented principally toward the exploitation of the lagoon resources (mollusks, fish, turtles) could have prospered on the shores of the lagoons. Early Forma- tive middens may be present in the Huave area. 4. The presence in the south-isthmic area of artifacts and elements affiliated with the Olmec culture opens once more the debate on the distribution and influence of this culture in Mesoamerica. Drucker, Heizer, and Squier (1959: pp. 253-259) have recently discussed this problem of distribution and influence. Small Olmec artifacts such as carved stone figurines or small sculp- tures are usually regarded as testimonies of trade con- nections and are not accepted as evidence of Olmec influence or territorial extension. However, there are five highly significant elements, clay masks in the form of bird heads, roller stamps of clay, rocker-stamped decoration, black vessels with white rims, and empty pits or basins which served no apparent purpose, which suggest trans-isthmic ties between the south-isthmic plains and the Olmec area which lies fewer than 150 kilometers to the north. The three first elements were identified by Delgado in Middle Formative deposits at Juchit'an; we discovered the last two in the Tehuan- tepec region. Roller stamps are rare at La Venta. Rocker stamping and clay masks are common at La Venta and also at Tlatilco. Black vessels with white oxidized rims and empty pits were found at Tehuan- tepec and La Venta, but on different time levels. Fur- ther excavations are needed at Juchit'an to gauge the intensity and analyze the nature of the Olmec influence on the south-isthmic region. 5. A problem which has so far received little attention from archaeologists and which in the future may prove to be as important as negative painting or Usulatan decoration, concerns the decoration of black vessels by means of a special firing technique. The body of in- formation on this so-called white-rimmed black ware is large enough to warrant the mapping of its distribu- tion and to make a study on how these white rims were achieved. As we have already pointed out, several methods can be considered. This decorative technique is fairly widely spread in Mesoamerica and seems to span a substantial period of time, from the Middle Formative to the Late Classic. This tradition is already firmly established in the Olmec culture. At Tlatilco the two-tone effect was achieved by means of oxidized spots on a black background rather than by a white rim contrasting with a black body. The origini of this technique is still unknown. 6. The value of the results achieved by applying the Type-Variety taxonomic method to the study of a non- Maya complex will remain a matter of speculation until further ceramic classifications based on this method and also from outside the Maya area are compared with our own classification. Therefore, we refrain from passing judgment on the validity of our types and varieties. On the basis of our experience, we conclude that the Type-Variety method is particularly well suited to classifying large amounts of ceramics consisting of several dozen types, each type divisible into several varieties. Whenever an archaeologist expects his clas- sification to include numerous types (the pottery of a Maya site for example) he will be wise to choose the Type-Variety method. Where few types are expected, as may be the case when dealing with an Eastern United States complex such as a Marksville ceramic complex, a simpler analytical device may bring the same results.</page><page sequence="160">APPENDIX A. FAUNAL REMAINS Faunal remains were found to occur sparsely in almost every layer of our excavations. They are usu- ally fragmentary and badly decayed and occasionally charred. None of the animals identified seem to have ever been a staple food. Mollusk shells and bones of brockets or mazama deer and turtles were the most numerous. Remains of fish, fowl, and crab were in- frequent, probably on account of poor preservation con- ditions. There is one instance of a small bone fragment of an unspecified cetacean. Indian dog bones were fairly frequent. Whether or not dogs were eaten can- not be determined. The small size of the bone fragments made identifi- cation difficult. Dr. Goodwin who examined them, with the exception of bones of brockets (Mazamnc ameri- cana), peccaries (Tayassu), and Indian dogs (Canis), could not assign them to genera or species. The distribution of faunal remains is as follows: Brockets -Ida o (Ala-ama Turtles Crab or Fowl Fish (Tayass Cetacean (Canis) americana) lobster FishyPeccar Cetacean Pit LI, Lieza Levels: 3 X X X 5 x 6 x 8 x 9 x 10 x x 11 X x Pit L3, Lieza x x Pit Bi, Boca del Rio Levels: 4 5 X X X X X 6 X X 7 X X 8ees X X X 18 x x 9 X 10 X 11 X X 13 X X 14 X 15 x x x 16 X 17 X X 18 X X X Pit B2, Boca del Ri'o Levels: 3 X 5 x x 6 X X 8 X 10 X 11 x 12 X X 15 x Turtles seem not to have been eaten during the Goma phase. Mollusk shells were found in moderate to fairly abundant quantities at Boca del Rio. At Lieza they are so rare that their presence seems accidental. The most common mollusks are clams, mussels, oysters, and snails (fig. 86). The shells of the Thais biserialis snail species were found broken. They were probably cracked open to get the pelecipods out. Almost all Thais and mussel shells are charred. It seems that these mollusks were steamed on an open fireplace pre- sumably made of red hot stones. Colonies of young and adult Cerithidea snails have been occasionally found in Formative deposits at Boca del Rio. Their presence in cultural layers suggests that they proliferated during flood periods when the site was under water. Shifts in the amount of use of mollusks during the Formative and Early Classic Periods at Boca del Rio are suggested by the bar-chart (fig. 86) which is based 161</page><page sequence="161">162 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS.

Taste alone cannot be the cause of these shifts. Changes in the salinity of the water or cyclical changes in the mollusk populations must also be taken into considera- tion. It is interesting to note that when mussels and oysters were popular food items, clams were scarce and vice versa. Mollusks were eaten during the Formative and Early Classic. It seems that Late Classic and Postclassic populations rejected the use of mollusks. Undoubtedly, mollusks contributed to the total caloric intake of the ancient inhabitant and were probably complementary to the basic grown food. The similarity of the percentage columns of Anadara esmieralda and A. grandis in figure 86 to that of Atem- pan Scraped pottery in figure 9 seems to suggest that a relationship existed between eating Anadara clams and making Atempan Scraped pots. The following mollusks have been identified. Most remarks on mollusks are taken from Keen (1958). Agaronia propatula and A. testacea (species). A snail similar to Olivella, but not used to make beads. Found on beaches and offshore. Anadara esmneralda (species). A clam found in sandy mud, mostly offshore in depths up to 30 fathoms. Average length, 5.7 cm. Anadara. grandis (species). A clam which grows to a length of up to 9.6 cm. May be gathered at low tide on the sand bars. Relatively abundant. Anonalocardia subimbricata (species). Small and rare clam. Anornalocardia subrugosa (species). Clam; not un- common. Average length 3.4 cm. Found on mud flats and shallow waters. Barnacles. Sometimes found stuck to oysters. Cerithidea (genus). Small snail shell found on mud flats, especially in brackish water or occasionally off the water. Average length 2.5-3 cm. Cerithiurn stercusmnuscarum (species). Snail; common on sand flats and estuaries in brackish water condi- tions. Average length 3.5 cm. Chamna (genus). Lives on rocks and intertidal zones. Choromnytilus palliopunctatus (species). Mussel. Av- erage length 6.8 cm. Very common. Found on exposed coasts in intertidal areas fastened to the rocks. Crepidula (genus). Limpets. Diplodonta obliqua (?). Found offshore. Average length 9 mm. Donax carinatus (species). Pelecypod. Found in depths up to 13 fathoms. Average length 3.9 cm. Donax gracilis ( ?). Found intertidally on sandy beaches. Average length 2.25 cm. Dosinia dunkeri ( ?) Glyceniieris gigantea (species). Found in depths rang- ing from 4 to 7 fathoms. Mactra augusta (?) Melongena patula (species). Snail. Common on sand and mud flats. Adults are up to 25 cm. long, but most are around 6-7 cm. Columella was often used to make tools or ornaments. Nassarius (genus).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES OF THE PACIFIC PLAINS OF THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC Twenty-seven sites (fig. 1) including Boca del Rio and Lieza have been visited and surface collections made. Delgado (1961) reported on Laguna Zope, La Ladrillera, and Lidgi Bigu near Juchit'an. The existence of eleven more sites has been confirmed by reliable sources; they have not been visited. We col- lected Late Formative material at Boca del Rio, Pixixi, Lieza, Juchit-an, and Los Tepalcates. Santa Teresa, Rancho Laguna, and Guiengola are ceremonial centers. Most sites are small with no indication of deep stratig- raphy. To our knowledge, Delgado carried out the only intensive survey on the Pacific Plains. The results have not yet been published. Seler ( 1904) left a complete report on Guiengola. Cerro Tortuga. About 17 kilometers south of Ixhua- tan lies this site. Badly eroded Postclassic sherds are thickly strewn on the flanks of conical hillocks which are surrounded by water during the rainy season. Almost all pottery is orange fired and is very similar to that we excavated in 1962 at El Paredon near Tonala, Chiapas. The collection includes fragments of bowl-and-handle censers, grinding stones, celts, and one pumice abrader. Chicapa. It is on the right bank of the Chicapa River, about one kilometer north of the village. Few</page><page sequence="163">164 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. sherds of the Late Classic and Postclassic Periods have been collected. Cheguigo. Classic sherds of the Xuku and Tixum sub-phases were collected on several low mounds lo- cated on the left bank of the Perros River, about 2 kilometers north-northwest of Ixtepec. Comitancillo. An ox-cart road cuts through shallow Late Classic and Postclassic cultural deposits west of the village. Pottery is sparse. One Mixteca-Puebla polychrome sherd was found. El Zapotal. Fine white paste ware of the Classic Period abounds here. There is some red-slipped ware with black on white or with white on black decorations which is probably affiliated with Toltec ceramics. Some rim sherds from shallow, rounded plates with red- painted lips are almost identical to rim sherds found in the lower Postclassic layers of a stratigraphical pit we dug at El Paredon near Tonal'a in 1962. Reu Silty pottery occurs in the form of tripods with long legs ending in bird, jaguar, or snake heads which are related to the Mixteca-Puebla culture. Delgado found an Olmec carved stone figurine at this site. Guiengola. We refer our reader to Seler's article (1904). Huazontlan. This site is in the Huave area near the mouth of the Tehuantepec River. We collected a few unidentified eroded sherds thinly scattered on the slopes of a hillock. One figurine head belongs to the Mold- made Face figurine type of the Late Tixum sub-phase or Late Classic Period. Huilotepec. Shallow deposits of the Classic Period are cut by the road leading from Huilotepec to Hua- zontlan on the left bank of the Tehuantepec River, about one kilometer south of Huilotepec. Km. 26.800. This site was found at kilometer 26.800 on the railroad tracks from Juchit'an to Uni6n Hidalgo. An ox-cart road cuts through the northern portion of the site and exposed deposits about one meter thick. The archaeological material is all Classic. Several Pearson Negative-Painted sherds with rows of dots in bands have been collected. The site is about 300 by 100 meters, with one small mound at the northern end. La Cienega. Most pottery collected here is made of fine, cream-colored clay mixed with a moderate amount of large quartz particles. This kind of paste is one of the diagnostic traits of the Late Tixum sub-phase in the Tehuantepec area. Toltec influence is suggested by several red-slipped sherds with black and white painted decorations. Los Tepalcates. About two kilometers north-north- west of Ixtepec, this site is on the right bank of the Perros River. About 2 meters of cultural deposits have been exposed by the river cutting into the site, which extends for over 200 meters. The lower layers are Late Formative, the upper, Classic. The material is identical to that of Boca del Rio and Lieza. Mixtequilla. This is probably one of the main Classic and possibly Postclassic sites of the Pacific Plains. Fine, white pasted ware predominates. Archaeological material is found widely scattered in and around the village. A fragment of a spiked censer was found. Piedra Parada. This Postclassic site has ceramic ware identical to that of Cerro Tortuga which is 8 kilometers to the southwest of it. Small loom weights or netsinkers of clay and obsidian blade fragments were particularly abundant. One small low mound of earth and stones has been looted or destroyed some years ago. Pixixi (San Isidro Pixixi). This site is a smaller replica of Boca del Rio. Sherds collected on the surface indicate an occupation from the Late Formative to the Postclassic. Potrero. A few scattered sherds were found on the slopes of a conical hillock on the shores of the Upper Lagoon. It is probably Postclassic. Rancho Laguna. It is a small ceremonial center consisting of two low stone and earth pyramids and a vast plaza extending south of the mounds. The site is on the right bank of the Tehuantepec River, about 3 kilometers northwest of Tehuantepec. A recent clearing of the forest exposed most of the site. Classic sherds are rare. Among them we identified one Tehuantepec Black-and-White and one Nichi Fine- Grained. The inside of the latter was brushed. Almost all sherds are Postclassic of the Reu Silty type which is related to the Mixteca-Puebla culture. Fragments of celts are frequent. San Cristobal. About 2 kilometers northwest of Ixhuat'an, this site seems to consist of several mounds. Only a handful of sherds was collected after a long search. They seem to belong to the Classic Period. San Jose Paraiso (fig. 87). This site, about one kilometer east of Pixixi, consists of several very low residential mounds. Fragments of stone celts and grind- ing implements are numerous. We collected Juchit'an Shell-Raked sherds and fragments of Mayoid and Teoti- huacanoid Slab Mold-made figurines. The figurines show dental mutilation. Except for one fine-paste sherd, all sherds are made of coarse pastes. It is not improbable that the material collected represents a Postclassic stage as yet unidentified. San Mateo del Mar. Most of the site, which lies about one kilometer north of San Mateo del Mar, is covered by a sand dune. The overwhelming majority of the eroded pottery is identical to that collected at Cerro Tortuga and Piedra Parada, and hence points to a Postclassic occupation. One stucco polychrome sherd has also been found. Santa Teresa. This ceremonial center, 3 kilometers northwest of Tehuantepec on the left bank of the Tehuantepec River consists of 5 pyramids made of earth and stones, various large plazas, and very proba- bly several burial mounds. The central pyramid is 6.30 meters high. Reu Silty sherds and fragments of ob-</page><page sequence="164">VOL. 57, PT. 2, 1967] ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES 165 sidian blades and celts are fairly common. The cere- monial center was undoubtedly built in Postclassic times, but it is probable that the site was occupied already in Classic times. Tehuantepec. A layer about 50-60 centimeters thick, consisting almost exclusively of Reu Silty pottery, was exposed on the eastern fringe of the town by people digging for clay. Large jars with strap handles and tripods with long legs are the most common shapes. The site probably represents a pure Mixteca-Puebla occupation. Tlacotepec. This was the favorite resort of Pelaxilla, the last queen of Tehuantepec. Cooler temperatures and two perennial streams which permit small-scale irrigation make Tlacotepec, at the base of the Sierra, one of the most pleasant areas in which to live within the south-isthmic region. Tlacotepec may have been the most important community during Classic and Post- classic times. La Cienega belongs to the same archaeo- logical zone in which Tlacotepec is located. Union Hidalgo. A few sherds of the Classic and Postclassic Periods were collected on a very low mound northwest of the village.</page><page sequence="165">166 WALLRATH: EXCAVATIONS IN TEHUANTEPEC [TRANS. AMER.
