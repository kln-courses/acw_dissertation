<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Smith's First Vision: The RLDS Tradition By Richard P. Howard I beg your forbearance for a brief autobiographical aside. Thirty years ago this month, just at a crucial point in the development of my religious interests and commitment, I was asked by leaders of a youth group in my home town of Independence, Missouri, to play the part of Joseph Smith, Jr., in a one-act drama. The setting was to be the inception of the Latter Day Saint faith. I accepted the task with some feelings of inadequacy, and yet I was eager to revive an old interest: acting before a live audience. So it was, early in the evening of a beautiful clear day in the spring of nineteen hundred fifty, that I spoke from memory what Joseph Smith, Jr., had caused to be published in 1842 in the Times and Seasons: his "official" narrative of the First Vision in the grove near his father's home in Manchester, New York. I count that dramatic experience as strengthening my attachment to Latter Day Saintism, with but one qualification, which I shall mention in a moment. I recited lines symbolizing a primal encounter between God and Joseph Smith, Jr. — an encounter that had had great impact on the audience hearing my recitation. That experience gave me my initial personal identifica tion with Joseph Smith, with that 1950 audience, and with the sense of destiny that connected them. Here was a community holding implicit faith in the Restoration, and there I was, gaining a new awareness of becoming an integral Richard P.

This paper was the basis of comments on the First Vision presented at the Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the Mormon History Association, Canadaigua, New York, May 1, 1980.</page><page sequence="2">24 Journal of Mormon History part of that community in a most unique way; and to a degree that in retrospect still gives me a bit of a tingle along my spine. The qualification I mentioned is a little harder to articulate. Many of the specifics of Joseph Smith's "official" version, together with the inferences that might be drawn from those specifics to contribute to a doctrinal system, never became vital to my identity as a Latter Day Saint. Such inferences as an anthropomorphic God, verbal inspiration largely propositional in nature, all other religious traditions as images of apostacy, and exclusivistic authoritarian ism as a vital mark of the "one true church" — these very meaningful inferences discernible in the language of the Times and Seasons account of the First Vision never took root in my thought and feeling. I was, to put it simply, overwhelmed with the centrality of God and Christ in the inception and mission of the Restoration in the world. That was the larger meaning of the vision to me then, and, despite a more sophisticated historical consciousness that has developed since then, that meaning has survived to this day. Quite truthfully it is impossible for one to characterize or generalize with any great degree of certainty regarding the RLDS tradition touching the matter of Joseph Smith's First Vision. Considering the tens of thousands of RLDS people that have lived in that tradition, only a handful have actually left behind a written record of what that vision had meant to them and to their faith in God and in the church. In view of that the wisest, most courageous, and humblest thing to do would be simply to sit down, let Grant McMurray re spond, and open the floor to discussion. But I believe that in the body of published literature of the RLDS church have appeared small but significant clues that may help us to identify some thing of the character and substance of any definable First Vision tradition. As one might suspect, writers in the very early RLDS publications — nearly to the turn of the century — found little reason to refer to the First Vision. The explanation for this lack of reference rests in part with the character of the concerns which the published writings do reveal, and I shall mention only five: 1. The concern for lineal succession in presidency. This was the major bur den of the early Reorganization's first publication, A Word of Consolation to the Scattered Saints (1852). All of the early Reorganization's periodical literature contained frequent arguments in support of the inherent right of Smith family heirs to the prophetic office in the Restoration. And such arguments obviously did not need authentication from the First Vision of Joseph Smith for legitimation. 2. Polygyny. From the outset a primary ingredient in the Reorganization's missionary, periodical, and pastoral literature was the concerted attack on plural marriage. The main thrust of these arguments during the first three decades of the Reorganization was on the basic evil of polygyny per se; after that, RLDS writers increasingly sought to dissociate the name of Joseph Smith, Jr., from any complicity in the inception of Mormon polygy ny. Whatever the burden of the arguments at whatever time, there was clearly no pressing call for references to the First Vision for validation. 3. The quest for re-claiming what were regarded as "lost souls"; i.e., Mor mons of various stripes who needed to be restored to the banner of the</page><page sequence="3">Howard: The RLDS Tradition 25 truest expression of original Mormonism. Trying to reach that audience meant addressing those who already believed in the divinely appointed mission of the original founder; these needed no proof or arguments verifying the First Vision account as they had known it from the Times and Seasons in 1842. 4. The experimentation continuously occupying RLDS leaders and members from the beginning, in order to fashion church order and polity, and to define administrative and ecclesiastical function and authority. Clearly such machinations of an in-house character required no consideration of accounts of the First Vision. 5. Another major subject in RLDS literature through the decades has been Zion and the gathering. Literally hundreds of major articles have appeared on one aspect or another of this concern from the early 1860s to the present time. Again, the First Vision and its meaning in our history do not impinge on such a theme. There are other important aspects of RLDS thought and history and writings relevant to this explanation for the sporadic treatment of the First Vision in the church's literature, but these five should illustrate my point sufficiently for present purposes. In the attempt to elucidate some elements of the RLDS tradition in the church's published literature, with respect to the first vision of Joseph Smith, a sort of spot check survey — focusing around the start of each new decade — of a wide range of missionary, pastoral, and periodical resources was made.1 The time span of this survey went from the earliest days of the Reorganization to the present. For our purposes here we have isolated nine distinct ideas or concepts related to the First Vision appearing in RLDS literature. I shall try to state each idea generally, mention the frequency of its appearance in the survey, and usually indicate when it was first found and most recently expressed. 1. An idea mentioned a total of eighteen times from 1909 to 1972 is the First Vision as having been an essential step in the restoration of the gospel and of revelation, or both. In some cases the idea is more strongly expressed in terms of the First Vision as being the actual restoration of the Divine-human communication process and the gospel, not merely an essential aspect of that restoration. The kinds of literature in which this idea is found is wide ranging: educational materials for children, youth, and adults; a movie script in 1972; history books; tracts; sermons; and doctrinal treatises. 2. Next in importance is an idea expressing the relationship of the Restoration to other denominations. Some of the key phrases come from the final account published by Joseph Smith in 1842: "Join none of them," "all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines," "their creeds are an abomination in my sight." This idea, found ten times in the survey, was either explicitly or implicitly cited as central to the experience itself, and not a conclusion Joseph might later have come to when formulating his accounts of the experiences. It was first expressed in a mild form by Marietta Walker in 'I am indebted to Keith Henry of the RLDS History Commission staff for assistance with this survey.</page><page sequence="4">26 Journal of Mormon History 1888 m a story for youth in her magazine, Autumn Leaves, there she simply says that the First Vision answered Joseph's question as to which church to join.2 Most of the other nine references were of that character. F. Henry Edwards, in his adult study text, Fundamentals, writing in 1940, put this idea most positively when he simply said, "and finally the experience of Joseph satisfied him as to his attitude toward denominations of his time. The Lord proposed to build his church."3 This idea of RLDS exclusivistic authority has surfaced in recent years in different ways, in part as a reaction to ecumenical tendencies in the church. In the recent 1980 World Conference several resolutions from church jurisdic tions strongly expressing the idea of the exclusive authority of the Restoration (Reorganization) came to the floor for discussion and action. All of them were defeated by a large majority of votes, and in their place, adopted by a vast majority of the nearly three thousand voting delegates, was a resolution en couraging church jurisdictions to engage in various interdenominational ministries for community and world betterment. This raises a question as to the degree of acceptance or rejection by RLDS people of today of the idea of exclusive sectarian authority as expressed in Joseph Smith's final account of the First Vision. It also suggests the possibility, as yet untested and unmeasured, that a heightened historical consciousness by RLDS people generally helps them to see a distinction between the First Vision and Joseph's later interpreta tions of it. 3. The idea next in importance has usually been expressed in general terms, during the fifty year period from 1920 to 1970; that is, that the First Vision is the foundation of the Restored Church, that it represents the birth, or, rebirth of the church in modern times. As Vida E. Smith wrote in Autumn Leaves in 1920, celebrating the centennial of the First Vision, the Grove experience 'unlocked — one hundred years ago — the chain that bound the church."4 This is a most powerful idea, in that if it is accepted without question at an early age, then Joseph's final account is usually accepted also, almost literally. Later, the discovery of the fact of the multiple and diverse accounts of the First Vision can lead one believing the First Vision to be "foundational" either to deny, rationalize, or ignore the evidence entirely. 4. Five writers from 1891 to 1919 stressed the idea that the important founding events in the restoration of the gospel were the angelic visitations to Joseph Smith from 1823 to 1827 resulting in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. These writers did not mention the First Vision in their explanations of the origin of the church; for the most part they saw the year 1830 as the crucial time, and this colored their assessment of the conditioning events and factors leading to the establishment of the church. 5. One interesting practice on the part of five authors was simply to include the entire final account of Joseph Smith's First Vision in their narrative ar lesson material, or to quote extensively from it, but to give no further 2"With the Church in an Early Day," Autumn Leaves 1 (May 1888): 195. 3Fundamentals: Enduring Convictions of the Restoration (Independence, Mo.: Herald House, 1940), p. 123. ""Found on page 182 of the April 1920 issue (volume 33).</page><page sequence="5">Howard: The RLDS Tradition 27 commentary on what it meant. A variety of resources are represented here, from cartoons for junior age children to the 1920 Autumn Leaves reprint of the Times and Seasons account from "Joseph Smith's History." Their idea was, "Let the First Vision speak for itself." 6. An idea emphasized by three writers, from 1911 to 1969, all of them writing to an audience of children, was that the First Vision illustrated the truth that God is unchangeable, speaking to his children today as he has always spoken. This is somewhat inconsistent with the notion of the apostasy, i.e., that long period of history during which God was apparently silent and the de nominations became so alienated from God and abominable in their creedal positions. The idea of the unchangeable God has sometimes fostered the view of the unchangeable church as well, even though it also can contribute to a more sophisticated, processive view of history. 7. One aspect of the First Vision that received attention from 1929 until very recent times, from three publications in our survey, was the statement from Joseph's final account, "This is my beloved son; hear ye him." The idea derived from that is the centrality of Christ in the Restored Church. Without specific reference to the First Vision, much literature in the Reorganization in the past two decades has stressed incarnational theology, which attempts to direct the church to the lived-out implications of this idea, of the centrality of Christ for the church's mission today. 8. In the RLDS centennial programs for 1930, one playlet was written for inclusion in worship services. This playlet perhaps expressed the idea that the First Vision and the later Moroni visions of Joseph Smith were intimately related, as a sort of whole experience in ushering in the Restoration movement, and restoring angelic ministry. 9. One extremely significant idea encouraging a view of the Restoration as an evolving process, never ending, places the First Vision in that framework as one of the steps of the evolution of the church. First expressed by Roy A. Cheville in RLDS senior high educational materials in 1948,5 this idea has been revived in a much more comprehensive context by the First Presidency of the RLDS church in its paper entitled, "The Identity of the Church": The Restoration movement's contribution to the understanding of God is that the Holy Spirit is constantly creating new occasions through which God's revelation in Christ may be shared with the world. The Restoration events that have occurred in our own history have special meaning in our fellowship because that fellowship grew out of this particu lar stream of revelatory history. From part of that history we discover insights into the nature of God's unending revelation to humankind In our history a new church and a new surge of prophetic vitality emerged from the initial experiences of Joseph Smith, Jr. and those closely associated with him in ministry The major emphasis was not upon the particularity of the event and the Book of Mormon, but it was upon the testimony of the revelation of God in Christ. From its earliest experiences the central theme of the Restoration movement has been that God does not leave the world without the witness of Christ and the guidance of the Spirit In fact, the Restoration is founded upon the concept of the linear organic relationship of unfolding history It 5"We Take the Long-time View," in Cheville's How Shall We Look at the World?, Gospel Quarterly Series, Department of Religious Education, RLDS Church (Independence, Mo.: Herald House, 1948), pp. 36-37.</page><page sequence="6">2X journal of Mormon History is a taith story about God s constant leading, supporting and intervening in the ongoing processes of human history. That history is a matrix of inseparable events connecting a continuous stream of generations of God's developing people.... God s presence in the world is not a sometime thing. The testimony of the Restoration is that God is not only in all past historical periods but is presently leading, guiding and blessing those who will follow. I he identity ot our church as an organized institution springs from a particular surge of revelatory experiences. These revelatory experiences have characterized our history from the inception of the movement in New York State in the 1820s. By the eye of faith and by integrity of scholarship we can trace the fine threads of spiritual, intellectual and cultural development backward through God's action in history to the upper room where Jesus met with his disciples, to the acropolis of Athens, and to a band of fleeing slaves from the mud pits of Egypt. We do not believe in a God who tries for a while and gives up, but rather in the One who is from everlasting to everlasting, the same unchangeable God — unchangeable in the relentless quest to bring humankind into the Divine presence in the kingdom. . . and to develop. . . the Restoration from its separa tist tendencies to the present insight that the Restoration is a process which must permeate human community from within. When we are honest about our own personal and corporate history, we realize that the apostasy and the Restoration were not events that happened one time in history but rather are processes continually at work among us.6 1 believe that one of the most significant dimensions of that interpretation of the Restoration by the RLDS First Presidency of today is, simply, that identifying the apostasy in terms of time frames or denominational representa tives no longer is an appropriate institutional task. There is no denial of the actuality of the First Vision; rather, there is, in this 1979 stance by the RLDS First Presidency, the attempt to interpret all of Joseph's initial spiritual experi ences in the broadest possible framework of the creative, redemptive, loving powers of God at work in all of human history. Incidentally, in my teaching and lecturing activity in the RLDS church during the past five years, I have systematically brought to the attention of hundreds of our people in a wide range of settings, the substantive differences in half a dozen accounts of the First Vision. In this process of education, I have engaged in some rather lively discussions with church people about what those differences mean for our historical understanding and theological reflection, rhe going has not been easy, for some have at first been so threatened by the new historical data that they have suspected me of denying the actuality of the First Vision. But in continuing the conversations with them, and in correspond ;nce, a heightened historical consciousness has emerged so that no longer does it seem necessary for many of them to equate Joseph Smith's later reconstruc tions and interpretations of the First Vision with the First Vision itself. They are :oming to see the fundamental difference between event and interpretation, ind the inevitable impact of later events on the interpretations of earlier events, and on the language chosen by Joseph Smith, Jr., to make those interpreta tions. On this basis I am led to conjecture that many RLDS people stand at the threshold of a genuine historical sophistication. Indicative ot this process is the forthcoming scholarly journal of the RLDS 6RLDS First Presidency, paper presented on January 9, 1979, at Independence, Missouri, to appointees and staff executives and their spouses, pp. 5-7.</page><page sequence="7">Howard: The RLDS Tradition 29 church as part of the sesquicentennial year, Restoration Studies, being edited by a former member of the First Presidency, Maurice L. Draper. He informed me on April 28, 1980, that my paper dealing with six variant accounts of the First Vision would be appearing in that journal. I had given the precursor of that article, in a much abbreviated form, in 1977 at the John Whitmer Historical Association meeting. Responding to it from a theological perspective was Robert Mesle, who is presently working at a much more definitive analysis and approach to the whole area of Latter Day Saint beginnings. The RLDS tradi tion, in short, is taking some interesting turns, the significance of which is not as yet easily seen or predicted. In any event, RLDS historians, theologians, poets, artists, linguists, deeply moved and augmented by the presence of the wondrously diverse and con flicting accounts of the First Vision, can begin the exciting work of developing a mythology of Latter Day Saint beginnings. This could be a mythology that transcends preoccupation with minute historical details that can never be fitted together in any sort of air-tight chronology: a mythology that discerns the most sublime symbolic possibilities in the accounts and begins to tell a new story of the founding and development of Latter Day Saintism. Such a story should always include the first vision of Joseph Smith, Jr., in his boyhood in New York. But it would free the RLDS tradition once and for all from the boundaries of so-called scientific history. Such a story would be at once cause for celebration and channel of power of the Holy Spirit. That spirit sends us forth, ambassa dors for Christ to bind up the broken hearted in a world sorely in need of a new Vision of God at work — in the midst of the brokenhearted.</page></plain_text>
