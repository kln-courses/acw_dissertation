<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS LITERARY STUDIES The Comic Imagination in American Lit erature, edited by Louis D. Rubin, Jr. Though commissioned for non-American listeners to the Voice of America, these thirty-two elementary forays also claim to be "the first full-scale symposium" on the subject. Rubin can be—and is—immodestly enthusiastic over his achievement. The trea sures are many: Jay Martin evoking the disturbed personality of Bierce, Seymour Gross admiring Welty's affirmation of life's possibilities, James Cox's perceptive syn thesizing of the Southwest's contributions to humor. Rubin's own essay, on the per manent warfare between vernacular and genteel humor in American history, is a superb endpiece, claiming neither too much for American humor nor understating its uniqueness. The scholar may glean few really new ideas from these four hundred pages, but he will find pleasure in their readability and stimulation to fill in neces sary gaps and take occasional issue, as he travels from colonial satirists through Mark Twain and minstrel shows to Humbert Humbert. Rutgers $12.50 Lucifer in Harness: American Meter, Met aphor, and Diction, by Edwin Fussell. This is a provocative sequence of three long essays, each divided into brief argu mentative chunks which facilitate digestion. Fussell begins and ends with the idea that the American poet's need to establish a non-British poetry is a political as well as an esthetic necessity which remains out of reach because the British and American languages are so similar. Fussell is a read able but self-consciously offhand writer, and he is a good thinker. However, he is finally not a very good critic. He evades argument often by failing to provide any of his own. Those readers who already agree with Fus sell will not mind this. Princeton $$.50 The Writer's Craft, edited by John Hersey. Anyone interested in the form of com position and the kind of literature generally defined as "creative writing" will find Mr. Hersey's book a superior anthology and an indispensable reference. The editor has in cluded in a single attractive volume the Ixxii comments, varying in length from one to twenty pages, of thirty-two noted writers on aspects of their craft under such head ings as "The Aim of Art," "The Question of Method," "The Writing Process," and so forth. The list of authors is comprehen sive, including Coleridge, Poe, Trollope, Conrad, Tolstoi, as well as Gertrude Stein, Sartre, Pasternak, Mailer, and Gunter Grass. Somehow all the selections, familiar or un familiar, make fascinating reading. The most interesting selections, however, are those which have not lost their freshness through frequent anthologizing. Among these are excerpts from Flaubert's letters to Louise Colet, excerpts from the diaries of Virginia Woolf and Thomas Mann, and a lecture delivered at Harvard by E. E. Cummings. To these might be added the "Paris Re view" interviews with Ralph Ellison, Saul Bellow, and William Burroughs, the accept ance speech which Solzhenitsyn sent to Stockholm on receiving the Nobel Prize in 1970, and John Fowles's "Notes on an Un finished Novel." These selections not only inform and stimulate but provide at times for the sensitive reader a moving experience. Knopf $10 The Uncollected Essays and Reviews of Y vor Winters, edited and with an Intro duction by Francis Murphy. This is far more than a collection of arti facts interesting only to Winters' disciples. If much of it is the work of a young man, it is still the work of an intelligent man, dedicated with now legendary fierceness to a kind of seriousness and integrity rare in any profession, but especially rare among literary critics. The many early items, dat ing from 1922, reveal the development of Winters' quirky tastes, but they also reveal a mind that refused to shrink from the diffi cult responsibilities of judgment and accu rate description. The idea of collecting these pieces was good. However, the production is disastrous: the book contains well over 150 printing errors. Some, like "accurary" and "percision," are amusingly emblematic, and some are unintentionally malicious: "Swineburne," "Allen Teat." But there are more serious problems, as when a French poem of sixteen lines is reduced nearly to nonsense by nine misprints. As anyone who</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS has published a book knows, Professor Murphy may not be responsible; on the other hand, he is responsible for the Pref atory Note, which contains this remarkable acknowledgment of a colleague's generous assistance: "If I did not wish to have him charged with my own errors and omissions, I would describe this as a joint effort." Un like the author of that sentence, Winters said what he meant, and let little escape him. Swallow $8.95 Henry James's "Sublime Economy Money as Symbolic Center in the Fiction, by Donald L. Mull. Mr. Mull offers a meticulous and pro vocative analysis of the "financial motif" in James's fiction. The biographical introduc tion explains that James experienced a ten sion between his sense of the "business" and "converting" imaginations, one that ap pears in his work as a metaphor for the human imagination's response to experi ence. Mr. Mull confines his exploration of this symbol to "certain key texts," primarily "The Portrait of a Lady" and "The Golden Bowl," yet his interpretation is comprehen sive in its references to James's novels and to previous criticism. His confident treat ment of a complex and fluctuating symbol is impressive for its intelligence and lucidity. Wesleyan $10 Hemingway's Spanish Tragedy, by Law rence R. Broer. In the early 1920's Hemingway felt that he needed a vacation from Paris, and Ger trude Stein suggested that he visit the north of Spain, where he might enjoy the week of bullfights at Pamplona. It was a germinal event for a man who, as Lawrence Broer argues in this concise if somewhat one-sided look at Hemingway's major novels, perhaps found in the Spanish sensibility and culture the blend of integrity and intensity, the spirit of particularismo, which his develop ing model of manhood wanted and his artis tic talent needed. With almost a Watsonian sense of development Broer paints Heming way as the quintessential matador from the moment of that first novillada onwards, and while this approach is consistent with much of Hemingway's work, particularly the worst, it easily confuses his mastery of Spanish sensibility as only one facet of his expression with a suffocating immersion in it. To have gone to Spain and never have left would have been, for Hemingway, genuinely a Spanish tragedy, but, after all, he was there and moved on. Alabama $7.50 The Political Identities of Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, by William M. Chace. There can be no doubt that for the twen tieth century the two prime movers of modern poetry have been T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. For that reason alone any new study that might throw light upon their achievements would be welcome. Chace has done a good deal more than merely give a fresh and clear interpretation of the rela tionship between the men and their poetry. He has carefully linked the specific prefer ences for politics with the proper reading of their works in a manner altogether en lightening. While this in itself is nothing new, Chace has presented this combined portrait of two giants against a backdrop of modern political movements that blends literature with politics in a very suggestive way Stanford $8-95 Back to Beckett, by Ruby Cohn. Recent Beckett scholarship has been anti scholarship; Ruby Cohn's book is an ex ample. Intuitive, subjective responses—pull ing back from metaphysics, turning away from orthodox literary analysis, "turning my back on what may be Beckett's own view of his writing,"—constitute the work ing material for Ms. Cohn's re-evaluation of her own and others' scholarship on this most complex and exasperating of produc ing writers. Because Ms. Cohn brings much erudition to her perceptions, the book holds insights and even wisdom, but whether it brings us back to an essential Beckett who has been confounded in too stringent schol arship is not convincingly demonstrated. A few photographic illustrations, including the exterior of his apartments, do not help. Princeton $12.50 The Novels of Virginia Woolf: Fact and Vision, by Alice van Buren Kelley. With plodding and meticulous thorough ness, Alice van Buren Kelley traces the lœxiii</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS development of Cartesian dualism in the novels of Virginia Woolf. In a cursory in troduction, Ms. Kelley defines the dichot omy between "fact" and "vision" as a dis tinction between the "world of physical isolation and limitation" and "the spiritual world of unity and pattern." She then pro ceeds to interpret Woolf's major fiction in antithetical terms and concludes that "Be tween the Acts" articulates a final Hegelian synthesis of polarities. Ms. Kelley's task is at best Procrustean, at worst Quixotic. She forces the text to conform to the structure of her argument and frequently fights non existent dichotomies. Her prose style is pe destrian and rife with dissertationese. This book offers an excellent summary of pre vious Woolf criticism, but its occasional flashes of "vision" are all too rare. If Ms. Kelley makes any contribution to the field of literary scholarship, her accomplishment must be considered synthetic rather than analytic. Chicago $8.95 D. H. Lawrence: Novelist, Poet, Prophet, edited by Stephen Spender. This is one of the more disappointing in the number of picture books with critical texts that have been appearing lately. Some of the articles seem pretentious or super ficial, and the photographs often have a drab appearance. Lawrence's paintings, espe cially, ought to be shown in color. Although interesting material has been contributed by Kermode, Alvarez, and Barbara Hardy, none of it can be called striking and a memoir by Frieda Lawrence's daughter may be the most valuable thing in the book. Harper &amp; Row $12.95 Browning's Major Poetry, by Ian Jack. Mr. Jack argues that a poet's complete works form a pattern that intensifies and completes our understanding of individual poems. For artists like Browning, whose literary output qualifies them as "full-time" poets, this pattern figures in the relation ship between masterpieces and minor works. Although he emphasizes Browning's cen trality in English poetic tradition, Mr. Jack limits his study to Browning's particular conception of poetry and variety of tech nique. After sketching the "most unusual shape" of Browning's "enigmatic" career, he discusses the early and mature poems, the love letters and "The Ring and the Book" both individually and within the larger con text. Mr. Jack's treatment—and reassessment —of particular poems often includes a con sideration of sources and influences as well as significant cross references to the rest of Browning's work. His comprehensive thematic approach reminds us of the impor tance of the love letters, explores the signif icance of Browning's own poetic catego ries, and de-emphasizes his "Roman murder story." Mr. Jack's perspective testifies to his own "years of reading and reflection" necessary for the discovery of "the pattern in the carpet" that forms the index to a poet's work Oxford $17.50 Some Words of Jane Austen, by Stuart M. Tave. Mr. Tave's sophisticated elucidation of Jane Austen's achievement is for readers familiar enough with the novels and crit icism to follow his deftly precise cross references to particular works. Although "eccentric," the pattern of his interpretation ("It is digressive on the word") is clearly the result of intelligent scholarship and re markable insight. Mr. Tave selects and ex plains certain terms in Jane Austen's lan guage—some of them obviously important within the cultural context, others more particular in their definition of the author's own reality. He traces their function in each novel as an index of Jane Austen's values, emphasizing that the broad scope of these "just and lovely words" increases with each new angle of approach. Mr. Tave rightly refuses to apologize for the limita tions or simplicity of Jane Austen's world; instead he compares her method to form and freedom as they are combined in the graceful, significant motion of the dance. This procedure is similar to Mr. Tave's own approach, for his critical perspective sub dues power with careful restraint. Chicago $9.95 William Blake: Essays in Honor of Sir Geoffrey Keynes, edited by Morton D. Paley and Michael Phillips. Sir Geoffrey Keynes has been one of the major forces in Blake scholarship and this tribute consists of sixteen essays on Blake, Ixxiv</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS "ranging from close analysis of the language of Blake's poetry, individual poems, and plates to thematic studies encompassing the greater part of his poetry and associated visual content." The essays are of uneven quality, but the reader will find valuable remarks in the contributions by F. R. Leavis, Josephine Miles, and John Beer. It concludes with a checklist of writings on Blake by Geoffrey Keynes, 1910-1972. The book, with 82 illustrations, is a fine example of bookmaking, but the price is staggering. Oxford $33.7J Blake's Night: William Blake and the Idea of Pastoral, by David Wagenknecht. The subject of pastoral in the work of William Blake is certainly a fruitful one, especially if one discusses the engravings and the poetry, and Mr. Wagenknecht quite rightly attends to both. He seeks to relate Blake's early poems to those of Spenser's "Shepheardes Calender" and to trace the pastoral idea in Blake's later works. The effort, however, has serious shortcomings since his idea of pastoral seems questionable and his interpretations forced. Harvard $12 The Awakening of Albion, by Thomas R. Frosch. The subtitle of this book explains its con tent: "Renovation of the Body in the Poetry of William Blake." It is divided into four sections, "Caverned Man," "Fallen World," "Renovation," and "Body of Imagination," and the author's points are excellently taken. Two things, however: surely Blake, whose eyes looked out at the world most inno cently, would be surprised at the volume of textual studies which had grown up around his writings; and, equally surely, he would have considered his images inseparable from his words, whereas in this book there is not a picture except on the jacket. Cornell fio Tristram Shandy: The Games of Pleasure, by Richard A. Lanham. This lively and independent study is of fered as a reply to the modern school of Sterne criticism that sees "Tristram Shandy" as an existentialist novel, the comedy of the absurd. Without rejecting the valuable in sights of recent critics—the recognition, for instance, that human beings can reach each other through sympathy when reason fails— Professor Lanham sees the novel as the cul mination of classical and Renaissance rhe torical traditions rather than as a precursor of modernism, and locates its essential meaning not in moralizing but in play. Uncle Toby on his bowling green reduces war to pastoral game; Walter Shandy's theories serve to ease his own mind rather than to instruct others; and Yorick and Tristram triumphantly master experience by apprehending it through the self-referential, liberating medium of play. The reader too must become a player, must participate in "Tristram Shandy" as game, not sermon. Professor Lanham's book is written with grace and wit, and should be of interest to the general reader as well as to the scholar and teacher. California $7.9; Satires Against Man: the Poems of Roch ester, by Dustin H. Griffin. As the first full-scale study of Roches ter's works, this book rightly emphasizes the Restoration intellectual and literary background; though in discussing literary influences on the poet, Mr. Griffin fre quently suggests specific borrowings for which he presents insufficient evidence. His careful readings of individual poems (es pecially the "Satyr Against Mankind"), however, bring out the uniqueness of Roch ester's response to the pressures of the age—his willingness, for example, to face honestly, if despairingly, the consequences of Hobbesian materialism. California $11 Dream in Shakespeare, by Marjorie B. Garber. This thematic survey charts the matura tion of Shakespeare's use of dream from the simple nightmares and presentiments found in the early plays to the rarefied mythopoe sis of the late romances in which the con gruence of illusion and truth seems mo mently cognate with the restorative magic of dramatic art itself. Though her analysis at times betrays the inevitable self-con sciousness and zest for the miscellaneous characteristic of any thematic approach, Ms. Garber has assembled the full evidence here to show the affinity between Shake spearean drama and the sleights and charmed conflations of the dream process. Ixxvi</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS However, Ms. Garber for the most part refrains from making any ongoing moral sense out of the drama before her, and by not adumbrating Shakespeare's co-ordina tion of vision and moral growth with the mysterious refreshments of grace, she leaves her reader with the impression that Shake spearean drama represents one long tribute to the transforming power of the human imagination. It is not surprising to come upon references to Wallace Stevens here. Yale $10 Shakespeare's Mature Tragedies, by Ber nard McElroy. It was Coleridge who first stated the uni fying principle of drama—"that ever vary ing balance or balancing of images, notions, or feelings as in opposing to each other; in short, the perception of identity and con trariety." Later critics have noted in Shake spearean drama the concept of comple mentarity, which holds that two things which should logically cancel each other out can exist side by side, both of them perfectly true. In the four mature tragedies, Mr. McElroy declares, Shakespeare explores one or more paired opposites, not simple ideas but complexities of opposites. For ex ample—and this simplifies too greatly this thorough and convincing study—Macbeth commits himself to the monstrous view of nature and man set forth by his wife and yet at the same time cannot abandon his ad herence to an opposite view where honor, love, obedience, friends are the real virtues, values from which he has estranged himself. By following the idea of contrariety of complementarity in each of these tragedies, Mr. McElroy can show us—and clarify for us—the central focus of Shakespearean trag edy: an experience that is complex and shattering for the tragic hero. An important, sensitive, and challenging book. Princeton $10 The Common Liar: An Essay on "Antony and Cleopatra," by Janet Adelman. A very fine and thorough analysis of the peculiar tragic quality of "Antony and Cleopatra." Professor Adelman points out the numerous questions and uncertainties that lie at the base of this play, and by de veloping rather than dismissing these per plexities she describes the play's meaning. Like the characters, we come to realize that our judgments cannot be verified, and, moreover, must be constantly revised as the play unfolds. Another element in the play, frequently shifting perspectives as a result of the many commentaries on the action within the play, militates against the tragic experience. Yale $8.7; The Compassionate Satirist: Ben Jonson and His Imperfect World, by J. A. Bryant, Jr. Critics have always been aware of the strong ethical emphasis in Jonson's major comedies, but they have been vexed by the difficulties of locating the perspective from which the playwright intended the follies he presents to be judged. Mr. Bryant argues convincingly that Jonson's judgment of his world is reflected in a series of satiric com mentators, the earliest of whom appears as Giuliano in "Every Man in His Humor" (1598) and the most significant as Quarlous in "Bartholomew Fair" (1614). As objecti fications of the author in the plays, these figures show Jonson working towards a "humane" view of the satirist (and thus of himself): one who, while he points out the follies of the times, is very much aware of his own limitations; and who performs his function as a service to society, not as a self aggrandizing amusement. This new and more generous view of Jonson's satirical posture produces some particularly good observations on individual plays (especially "Volpone" and "Epicene") and gives us a solid foundation for further investigation of the poet's artistic aims. Georgia $8.50 The Resources of Kind: Genre-Theory in the Renaissance, by Rosalie L. Colie. This study of the mixed genres of the Renaissance is a ground-breaking work. The argument is that Renaissance genres are best understood as mixtures based on past ideas of genres and the forms currently available. The author points out the interchange of sonnet and epigram in the small forms and the comprehensive incorporation in "King Lear" of the morality structure, folklore, private theatre scenes, the emblematic tableaux. The book is directed at the as sumption that genre forms were fixed. The wealth of evidence assembled supports the lœxvii</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS view that, in practice, and in theory, the mixture of forms was the characteristic pro cedure. California $6 The Disease of the Soul: Leprosy in Medie val Literature, by Saul Nathaniel Brody. Mr. Brody takes as his theme the demon stration that in medieval literature, the con dition, leprosy, was considered to be an outward manifestation of a moral degenera tion, frequently imposed by God on un believers. The disease, leprosy or Hansen's disease, known in modern medicine to be caused by mycobacterium leprae, is a single entity, but it seems probable that the name was applied in medieval times to any one of an assortment of skin conditions which resemble, more or less, the signs seen in lep rosy. Mr. Brody, after initial discussions of the medical understandings of leprosy in medieval times and the status of lepers in medieval society, considers the ecclesiasti cal traditions and the stigma of leprosy in the Bible. The final portion of the book is concerned with several works of literature in which leprosy plays a major part. The first is Hartmann von Aue's "Der Arme Heinrich," followed among others by ver sions of "Amis and Amiloun" and "The Testament of Cresseid," a sort of sequel to Chaucer's "Troilus and Criseyde." Mr. Brody's book is of interest to medievalists, well researched and organized, and is quite convincing. Cornell #9.50 Modern Latin American Literature, by D. P. Gallagher. This book offers an excellent introduction to Latin American literature as well as valuable critical insights into particular au thors and works. Although rarely treating a subject in depth, Gallagher provides a broad survey of important authors and movements. While Borges and Neruda are well known in this country, some of the most significant comments deal with younger writers like Vargas Llosa, Cabrera Infante, and Garcia Marquez. Some read ers may disagree with the selection of au thors, particularly the slight mention of Cor tâzar and the Brazilians. Still, Gallagher's book is extremely valuable for the English reader and should help stimulate the grow ing interest in this literature. Oxford $7.50 Ixxx The Bow and the Lyre, by Octavio Paz; translated by Ruth L. C. Simms. Octavio Paz, the first-rate Mexican poet, has produced in this work of literary criti cism a rich jungle of suggestion and conclu sion as comprehensive and colorful as a long Latin-American poem. As exuberant as any of his contemporaries, Paz sees po etry connected with almost everything of human interest and covers as much philo sophical, historical, and social ground as he does literary history. His allusiveness knows neither geographical nor temporal borders and his romantic gusto is contained only by his simple decency and his loyalty to art. Texas $8.50 The Concept of Negritude in the Poetry of Léopold Sédar Senghor, by Sylvia Wash ington Bâ. Though it reads at times like the editorial section of a rigidly controlled party news paper (in its apologetics, not its style), Syl via Washington Bâ's book constitutes a use ful study of negritude. The movement itself, which began in France during the 1930's, has been subjected to so many varying in terpretations that it is refreshing to have an analysis based on the canon of the most im portant proponent. Chapters two and six, dealing with "The Experience of Negri tude" and "The Future of Negritude," are the most insightful. The detailed and fre quently repetitious treatments of Black African ontology and psychophysiology and the rhythms and images of negritude might well have been condensed. But the selected poems of Senghor, the glossary, and the bibliographies at the conclusion will be serviceable to the student of negritude. Given the quality of the paper and the binding, the price is outlandish. Princeton fn A Poetics of Composition, by Boris Uspen sky. Uspensky is one of the bright young Russian structuralists. He addresses the problem of point of view in literature and also in pictorial art, drawing upon the early work of the Formalists, also of Bakhtin and Yuri Lotman. He concentrates his at tention successively on a series of "planes"— ideological, phraseological, spatial and tem</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS poral, psychological—then attempts to dem onstrate the variety of interrelationships that may exist among them. The transla tion of a difficult text by V. Zavarin and S. Wittig was reviewed by the author him self; it reads very well. Uspensky skates close to faddishness on occasion, but keeps his feet. A stimulating book. California $9 Oblomov and His Creator, by Milton Ehre. Not quite the first book on Ivan Gon charov in English, but certainly the best and not only in English. Ehre's prime con cern is with the transition from esthetic theory to literary practice. His central the sis is that Goncharov divided life into two halves: the practical and the ideal or es thetic. Ehre contends that Goncharov was a lifelong Romantic, yet opted for a safe ca reer as literary censor and reliable bureau crat. Similarly, in his fiction "he reversed his evaluation of the two halves of life so that the 'ideal' became the butt of his irony." For once the blurb is correct: Ehre does demonstrate keen intelligence and lit erary sensitivity, as well as broad reading and culture. Princeton $ 14.50 The New Criticism in France, by Serge Doubrovsky; translated by Derek Coltman. This is an historical study of the conflict between the traditionalists and the French new critics, a conflict that dates from the quarrel between Roland Barthes and Ray mond Picard in 1969. Mr. Doubrovsky dis cusses the various movements in France— phenomenological, psychoanalytical, Marx ist—and provides the most comprehensive statement now available of the various types of criticism in the new movement. The book is introduced by a valuable essay by Edward Wasiolek, placing the Russian Formalists and the American New Critics in a context leading to the French New Critics. There is a useful bibliography. Chicago $10.50 The Divine Woman, by Edward H. Schäfer. This is a book about a theme, a recur rent theme in T'ang literature concerning dragon ladies and rain maidens. As Pro fessor Schäfer notes, references to these "divine women" are to be found throughout much of Chinese prose and poetry, but it is in the T'ang Dynasty that the theme comes to something like a focus. After working through this slender volume (with its excel lent glossaries and notes), one rereads the poetry of, for example, Tu Fu with a much more complete understanding and apprecia tion. California fio Menander: A Commentary, by A. W. Gomme and F. H. Sandbach. This is a necessary book for anyone seri ously interested in what remains of Me nander, the only commentary (in English, or any other language) on all of Menander's extant writings, keyed to Sandbach's own (1972) text in the series of Oxford Classical Texts. The project had been initiated by A. W. Gomme, late Professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow, and after Gomme's death was brought to completion (with considerable revision of what Gomme had left) by F. H. Sandbach, emeritus Pro fessor of Classics at the University of Cam bridge. An introduction, about sixty pages in length, deals briefly with the major prob lems associated with Menander's life and times, the circumstances of the production of his plays, and the slender text-tradition. What follows is line-by-line commentary, the sort of thing that would be found in any scholarly edition of an ancient text, such as Bailey's (1947) on Lucretius. It is some thing of a puzzle that the works of a writer with the enormous reputation enjoyed by Menander in antiquity have not survived in greater extent. This volume will assist the modern reader very greatly in arriving at a personal estimate of the dramatic art of Menander. Oxford $38.50 Folktales in Homer's "Odyssey," by Denys Page. Homer's "Odyssey" represents, as has long been recognized, a blend of genuine epic material, by which is meant dimly-re membered history from an idealized and heroic past, with a substantial element of universal folklore. The first four chapters of this book are essentially the 1972 Carl Newell Jackson lectures at Harvard by Sir Denys Page, Regius Professor of Greek at Cambridge, who explores the symbolism and derivation of some of these folktales, locococi</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS such as those having to do with the Lotus Eaters, the Laestrygonians, Circe, Aeolus, the Cyclops, and the Sirens. The final chap ter, in the nature of an Appendix, presents Sir Denys' attractive theory about the pre cise character of the exploit in archery per formed by Odysseus after his return to Ithaca for the discomfiture of Penelope's suitors. The author's scholarship, which is in fact very profound, rests lightly upon him, and the book offers a highly enjoyable afternoon of fairly light reading. Harvard $6.50 FICTION Embarkation, by J. R. Salamanca. Father and son dominate Mr. Salamanca's enchanting story about an artisan in love with the boats he builds on the shores of Chesapeake Bay for his demanding clients, insistent as he in the pursuit of perfection. While the son serves as the narrator and as a foil for his father, the real hero is the Bay itself with its rapidly changing moods and perennial challenge. Infinite charm in a real istic setting with adroitly presented char acters, plus a beguiling style as a story teller, make the book an unpretentious and re sounding success. Knopf $6.9$ The Sightseer, by Geoffrey Wolff. Exploitation of the "camera eye" has in recent years been minimized ever since its primary use as a narrative tool by Dos Passos, but in these pages it is a featured device, not very successfully or convinc ingly employed, it is true, and sometimes an actual impediment in developing movement. While Mr. Wolff's protagonist views every thing with his camera eye, the author does not seem to be capable of projecting his book in visual terms acceptable to the reader, from Vienna, where the story origi nates, into the Austrian Tyrol, and thence to Turkey, where action ceases as the book capriciously ends. Random $6.95 Watership Down, by Richard Adams. This rabbit tale of adventure and awak ening, told with disarming élan and happily devoid of rabid anthropomorphism, owes a great deal more to Tolkien than to Jack London, as animal stories go. It chronicles a small group of rabbits as they leave their old warren and migrate over the Berkshire countryside, through thick and thin, to find a new home. One can argue the merits of fantasy, animal stories, picaresque novels of escape, Edgar Rice Burroughs, fables, or going through the looking-glass until the bunnies come home, but this is pleasant reading well told. Macmillan $6.95 As If by Magic, by Angus Wilson. This latest novel by Wilson is one which he considers to be of his best. It is adver tised as Dickensian (if he were Russian, this would be Gogolian) and Wilson's stated didactic purpose is to correct our modern lust for the irrational and the abso lute with the cold douche of satirical social surrealism. Surrealism is given to us mostly through the sexual pratfalls of representa tive heroes and heroines. International jets prove to be less helpful than the gigs of Jane Austen, social confusion still (as in her time) the result of vanity and folly. But though there is lively writing here, the book, laudable though its aim be, does not have the weight of convincing. Viking $8,95 The Case Worker, by George Konrâd. This powerful first novel by George Konrâd presents a portrait of the lost people of a modern city. At once horrifyingly real istic and lyrical, the book investigates the social worker's relationship with his clients and the State. His daily life becomes a des perate struggle to retain his humanity. Con fronted with the environment of poverty, the narrator instinctively searches for some meaning in the suffering of his cases. Using an episodic form, the novel progresses through a series of poetic insights. Both as a social document and an important work of literature, this novel is well worth reading. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $6.9j Three, Seven, Ace, by Vladimir Tendrya kov. To publish at all in Russia must be a dif ficult task since one's text must pass through so: many hands before its final approval. There is little wonder, then, that even the best work takes on the rather weary air of the committee room. Moreover, life in lœxxii</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Russia does not move at quite the speed of that in the Western world. As a result the development in fiction, as in films, is a more languorous process than in those of the West. Tendryakov's three stories par take of these two differences, and, as dif ficulties, they set up an impediment be tween author and the Western reader, an impediment which the reader may not wish to surmount. Harper &amp; Row $6.95 POETRY Cochise, by Peter Wild. This popular poet's career has been a young poet's dream. He began in the best of the little magazines, published his first books in a highly respected avant-garde poetry series, and, in five short years, has moved to the front list of one of the best commercial publishers. The reasons for this rapid ascent are clear. The poetry is set in the Southwest, the garden of Eden for this season's younger generation. Added to this immediately attractive, if confining, sense of locale is a diction marked by unexpected turns of phrase and tricky end linked lines that suggest the significance of statement so hard won by poets like Wright and Haines. Wild's best work is probably in "Mica Mountain Poems." In poems like "Rattlesnake" language and meaning create excitement and vitality. This achievement and promise is already a little diminished in "Love Poems" where the love affair is more with language than with sense. Collections followed. "Wild's Magical Book of Cranial Effusions" and the more comprehensive, "New and Selected Poems" confirm a de bilitating preoccupation with inventiveness at the expense of quiet comprehension. There are excellent lines, even splendid poems like "Kite Man," but the work as a whole turns back on itself at maniac speed. The present collection is full of restless energy. The uses of rhyme seem never to have occurred to this poet. All of the poems rest upon an upsetting and unconfined en counter with the physical world—weather, landscape, or people. These collisions end by being as baffling to the poet as they are to us. Possibilities skyrocket into fantasy. "My whole life is a trance, I hope to break from," he writes. But surely this fancy cat dance around any effort at integration with reality is the key to his success. That kind of thinking has been popular for a long time; it is particularly beguiling here. Doubleday $5.95; paper $2.50 The Death Notebooks, by Anne Sexton. Offering us a mixture of personal re demption and self-indulgent despair, Anne Sexton again dazzles us with her forceful and lively language. The Psalms and Fury poems in this volume build up a personal religion which is present in the simplest images ("First Psalm"): "Let there be a heaven so that man may outlive his grasses." Anne Sexton's poems succeed by virtue of their honesty and the beauty of her lan guage. Her vision, however, remains self defeated; the presence of death, as in "Hurry Up Please It's Time," speaks more clearly than the life forces: "Of course earth is a stranger,/we pull at its arms/and still it won't speak./ The sea is worse./ It comes in, falling to its knees/ but we can't translate the language." Houghton Mifflin $5.95 The Hunt Within, by James B. Hall. It is refreshing to read these poems, be cause it appears that their author has evolved his way of writing without trying hard to learn how contemporary poems are made generally. This is not to say that Hall is ignorant of the craft, for he is not; but his work is remarkably free of conventional gestures, and has an air of determined in dividualism. Sometimes the lack of sophisti cation is embarrassing, as in "How to Make the Poem," a fine and detailed speech by a master wheelwright which should not have been made rigidly allegorical by its title. At other times, as in "Dressing Your Deer," the implications of the precise and sound in structions are allowed to take care of them selves. That is what most of these poems are prepared to do. Louisiana $4-95 Town and Country Matters, by John Hol lander. This slim, handsomely produced volume of gently erotic verse serves up translations of Catullus's along with the poet's own son nets and longer poems. Hollander's tales are told with wit and intelligence. There is a Ixxxiv</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS constant sensual delight with the world about him which gives his poems a rich texture full of sights, sounds, and fra grances. His images are those of a painter, but the lasting impression is of the bitter sweet humor he brings to mankind's oldest pleasure. Godine $6.çj The First Firefly, by Melville Cane. It is unfortunate that the chief interest of this book lies in its author's gracefully ad vanced age. That he was born in 1879 and continues to lead a productive and valuable life is reason enough to salute him, but not reason enough to ignore the decidedly minor stature of these writings. Cane has some gift for light verse, but in this he is easily surpassed by John Updike or William Jay Smith. His straightfaced poems have the flavor of aged pronunciamento. The prose items have much intrinsic interest, being memoirs of Cane's associations with such figures as Upton Sinclair, Thomas Wolfe, and Harry Houdini. The collection pro vides an evening with some entertaining moments. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $5.95 No Vacancies in Hell, by Daniel Mark Ep stein. When, as in "The Exile's Letter," Epstein refrains from fancy poetic diction, he can be moving and powerful. "The Exile's Letter" builds an impression of loneliness until the speaker is left "hoping that one straw of sunlight piercing a cloud/ can prop the sky up for a few more hours." Too many of the other poems in this collection lapse too easily into bombast or sentimental ity, though "Letter Concerning the Yellow Fever" is remarkable for its historical sense, for the ease with which it bears a debt to Lowell, and for its sustained strength. Liveright $4.95 Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems, translated by George Kline. Unlike that of the flexible Yevtushenko, Mr. Brodsky's recent travel outside Russia has been both compulsory and irreversible. But an excellence which is of intangible benefit to that state is detested there, so our still extant republic will hear (if it wants to) the gentle and genuine poetry of one who was a worthy friend of the great Akhma tova and of the noble widow of Osip Mandelstam. Meanwhile, the cunning Yev tushenko will attract, as if he were another McKuen, those who "normally don't read poetry." Harper &amp; Row $5.95 LIVES &amp; LETTERS The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Volume X, 1847 1848, edited by Merton M. Sealts, Jr. Like all the preceding volumes of this edition, this one is edited with meticulous care, and has an excellent index that will facilitate its use by scholars and other read ers. Emerson's notes embrace a wide variety of interests and activities, ranging from di rections for the planting and care of hedges to quotations from Plato and comments on Platonic philosophy. But most of them re late to his experiences of contemporary life in England. He admired British manners and the worldly success of nation and peo ple, but he disliked their egotism and gross materialism. England, he found, was a para dise for the rich aristocrat, but a bad place for the poor and the ordinary citizen, who appeared nevertheless to accept his inferior condition as inevitable. During his first months in England he was dazzled by the men of superior talent whom he met, but later, on reflection, he found himself sadly disappointed in many of the same men. He spent a month in France during the revolu tionary excitement of 1848, and though he admired the French sense of freedom, he discovered that they were scarcely less materialistic than the English. He has much to say of some distinguished Britons active in public and literary affairs, especially of Carlyle, but before many months of living in Europe his pride in America and Ameri cans was not only restored but enhanced. Some of the material of this journal was used later in "English Traits," but much also went into other works. There is still enough unused material to make the journals a val uable addition to the published works al ready available. It is a great storehouse of ideas from perhaps the most balanced and mature period of Emerson's intellectual life. Harvard $2; hcxxv</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Wilia Gather: A Pictorial Memoir. Photo graphs by Lucia Woods and others. Text by Bernice Slote. A place is not "real" until discovered by the world outside. A lived-in continent be came real in 1492; the Mississippi Valley, through Mark Twain, was discovered by the East and certified as real; the Plains of Nebraska—windswept streets, lone trees, isolated Czech and French villages, enor mous skies—were discovered through Willa Cather. But Miss Cather was also a girl in Virginia, an editor in Pittsburgh, a lover of New York and New Mexico. This big square book of highly evocative photo graphs, clean and tasteful in design, effec tively highlights her life, her tastes, her career, and the places she so successfully en abled others to discover. It is a splendid centenary tribute, a necessary book re minding us how necessary Willa Cather is, in perceptions and experience. Nebraska $15 Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Com pany, by James R. Mellow. "I wanted to hear their voices," says James Mellow of Picasso, Matisse, Apolli naire, Toklas, Stein, and the others who form the cast of "Charmed Circle: Gertrude Stein and Company." He wishes to por tray an honest woman, not a literary leg end; to present Gertrude Stein's unconven tional life and literary style, to recreate the texture of her life. It is all there—the early years in California, the Radcliffe and Johns Hopkins student days, the exciting Saturday evening international salons and art buying ventures in Paris, the sunny happy seasons in Bilignin, and then Alice alone after Ger trude's death in 1946 from cancer. Mellow presents the quality of the relationships be tween Gertrude and Leo Stein, May Book staver, and Alice Toklas, the friendships and feuds with the greats of artistic and literary worlds before and between the world wars. Based mainly on letters and memoirs, the book is a balanced, affectionate, absorbing chronicle of a dominating figure with a careful evaluation of her works. It suc ceeds in making the persons and places live. "Charmed Circle" charmed. Praeger $12.9$ James Madison: A Biography in His Own Words, edited by Merrill D. Peterson. For this volume of Newsweek's Founding Fathers series Professor Merrill Peterson has selected and carefully edited approxi mately 175 letters and other writings through which to convey the biography of James Madison. Allowing Madison to speak for himself brings forth not only the po litical and diplomatic skills of Madison but also his human qualities and social traits, characteristics too often denied to the little man who usually dressed in black. It is not surprising that this book highlights Madi son's correspondence with Thomas Jeffer son, a trusted neighbor, friend, and political ally with whom Madison felt most at ease in confiding personal as well as public in formation. Other prominent recipients of Madison's letters as presented are William Bradford, James Monroe, and Edmund Randolph. The editor's brief but frequent comments tie the documents together so as to present a balanced portrait of the sub ject. Additional information is provided in superb captions accompanying most of the 389 illustrations, including those in two color portfolios. The book, which will serve equally well as a work of reference and a work of art, stands as a fitting tribute to the man perhaps most worthy of the title of "Founding Father." Harper &amp; Row $if James Dakin, Architect: His Career in New York and the South, by Arthur Scully, Jr. In spite of minor lapses (can a pilaster be called a column or a caption indicate the presence of a quatrefoil, even though the quatrefoil appears in another photograph on another page? ) this is a most valuable book. Carefully based on primary material, it traces the career of the architect, who only lived forty-six years ( 1806-1852), from New York to New Orleans. Handsomely illus trated both from his own drawings and from photographs, the text makes a reat tribution of several important buildings in the history of American architecture dur ing the first half of the nineteenth century. Dakin worked in both the Greek revival and the Gothic revival styles, but one of his masterpieces is undoubtedly the Gothic revival Louisiana State Capitol, which domi nated its cityscape so splendidly and dra Ixxxviii</page><page sequence="12">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS matically in the past. To replace Dakin at the proper level of his achievement is a very welcome piece of work. Louisiana $15 The Man Haupt: A Biography of Herman Haupt, by James A. Ward. Most students of the Civil War remember Herman Haupt as the man who organized and ran the railroads for the Federal Gov ernment during that period. Few know much about his long and eventful life. A West Point graduate, he got his real start in his career with the Pennsylvania Rail road, and the biggest failure of his life, at least as far as finances were concerned, was his attempt to bore the Hoosac Tunnel in western Massachusetts. After the war, he continued his railroad career with the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, the Pennsyl vania again, and finally the Northern Pa cific. He also was a designer and engineer for the first long-distance crude-oil pipeline. Professor Ward has written an excellent book about a very interesting personality. The work is very thoroughly researched, as evidenced by copious footnotes on every page and a lengthy bibliography. Louisiana $11.95 Victorio and the Mimbres Apaches, by Dan J. Thrapp. In this detailed and highly documented account of the life and times of Victorio (a contemporary of Geronimo of the Chiri cahua Apaches), Mr. Thrapp succumbs to a tempting intellectual persuasion that divides good and bad along racial lines. To Thrapp the Indians are or have been maligned heroes who, with an occasional "good" or well meaning agent, struggled with the federal government to retain remnants of their old lands and tribal authority. To prove his point, the author subjects the reader to coundess descriptions of raids and counter raids, treaties and broken treaties, negotia tions and suspended negotiations. Through it all, Victorio remains somewhat obscure and one never really comes to know, much less to understand, the man or the Mimbres Apaches. Oklahoma $9.95 Alive in the City: Memoir of an Ex-Com missioner, by August Heckscher. For several years August Heckscher served as Parks Commissioner for New York under Mayor John Lindsay. His mem oir is an account of those years, candid, pointed, and surprisingly well written. The horrors of political life, the endless checks and balances, the inevitability of displeas ing a very vocal opposition with the best intentioned act, as well as the tedium of meetings and the personal slurs are for once shown up in their true colors. One wonders how anything is accomplished. Öh the other hand, Mr. Heckscher seems to have taken it all with a mildly amused grain of salt, is glad to have made his contribution, and, in spite of being rather badly battered, is far from being discouraged at the difficulties of managing our cities. His is a hopeful voice among the many Cassandras of the New York scene. Scribner's $8.95 Hitler: Legend, Myth, and Reality, by Werner Maser; translated from the German by Peter and Betty Ross. Werner Maser has published a reliable history of the early years of the Nazi party and a critical study of Hider's "Mein Kampf." The biography which has oc cupied him for twenty years is now before us in a good translation. On those aspects of Hitler's life which he has chosen to ex plore, Maser has probed deeper and pro duced more fresh evidence than his prede cessors. Indeed, rather than production of a rounded biography, the author seems ob sessed with the search for objective facts behind the myths and legends of Hider's life and career. He presents Hider as a unique human phenomenon; there is no at tempt to place him in the context of his times, and the emphasis is on What he was rather than what he did. Much new infor mation about Hitler's family antecedents^ his youth, schooling, and development of his personality and character result from Maser's pursuit of hitherto unexploited sources. For example, the myths and legends that developed around his Vienna years (1908-13)—some self-generated in "Mein Kampf' and some propagated by hostile journalists—are pretty thoroughly dispelled. The vagabond Hitler is replaced by a tal ented youth who made a decent living as a second-rate artist, though his interests centered on architecture. Although an Aus Ixxociœ</page><page sequence="13">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS trian subject, Hitler served with a Bavarian regiment in World War I. His record was latter attacked by political opponents but the archives of the Bavarian war ministry reveal that he served with distinction and merited the award of the Iron Cross first and second class. The sources of Hitler's Weltanschauung has puzzled many histori ans. While Maser probes Hitler's intellect ual background more thoroughly than any of his predecessors, he is led to conclude that "Without grossly distorting the facts it would be impossible to depict Hitler's Weltanschauung as reflecting any one doc trine or coherent part thereof, or again as following the tradition of a readily recog nizable school of thought. Nor can he be seen as the disciple of any one specific thinker, scientist or writer." It would seem, then, that in his self-education through ex tensive reading, Hitler adopted only what accorded with his singular and unique pre conceptions. Two chapters are highly per sonal—Hitler's health and his relations to women. The latter, necessarily, is based mainly on hearsay and testimony at second or third hand. Maser concludes that Hitler was sexually normal, that his relationship to his niece, Geli Raubal, was incestuous, and it was rumored she was pregnant when she committed suicide. This study also gives us a fresh appraisal of Hitler's medical history, which Maser follows in great detail through the records and depositions of Hitler's per sonal physician, Dr. Theodor Morell. He is able to establish in detail the course of Hit ler's deteriorating health, the innumerable drugs prescribed and ingested, and the freakish dietary practices adhered to by the Führer. Maser holds that during the war Hitler underwent a profound mental and physical change as a result of illness, and that this radically affected his conduct of the war. During the last year of his life his health went rapidly downhill and his mili tary decisions became increasingly erratic and fanciful; physically he was little more than a wreck when he committed suicide. If you want microscopic insights into many facets of the mind and personality of Adolf Hitler, this is your book, for despite all its pretensions and pedantries it deserves great respect. Harper &amp; Row $12.50 Ho Chi Minh, by Charles Fenn. This "biographical introduction" will be a standard work on Ho Chi Minh. Charles Fenn's friendship with Ho and experience in Asia has enabled him to write an account at once sympathetic and analytical. Most interesting is Fenn's description of Ho as a United States Intelligence agent during World War II—helping allied airmen avoid Japanese capture in exchange for United States weapons. Scribner's $5.95 Mortal Wounds, by Anthony West. In this study of Mme. de Staël, Mme. de Charrière, and George Sand, Mr. West pre sents three literary figures from the point of view of psychopsychiatry. And a rich, sur prising study it is. He shows each of the three in very plain terms, then relates these all too human figures to their works. Since Mr. West does not have a very high opin ion of any of them, since he has a gusty and persuasive style, and since he is, of course, quite right in most instances, the reader emerges with very changed ideas about all three of them. The method is extended in an epilogue to Flaubert, Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, and Proust in not quite so full but equally persuasive manner. Could it be that a new direction in literary criticism has been explored? McGraw-Hill $10 The Waltz Emperors, by Joseph Wechs berg. Joseph Wechsberg's long acquaintance with and present residence in Vienna, plus his interest in and practice of the art of music via the violin and participation in string quartet playing make him the likely, the ideal person to write of the Strauss dynasty, the Waltz Kings of Vienna. Start ing with Johann the Elder, son of a tavern keeper and along with Joseph Lanner the originator of the waltz craze, the narrative follows the fortunes of the family to the death of Johann the Younger, who was of course its most renowned member, and to whom the bulk of the text is rightly de voted. The final paragraph of chapter 10 gives the details of the third and succeeding generations. Mr. Wechsberg places the trials and triumphs of the Strausses in the frame XC</page><page sequence="14">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS work of the history of Austria and Vienna. Thus we get a vivid picture of the time. Lavish illustrations add to the value of the book. In spite of a somewhat jerky manner of writing, which this reviewer has never been aware of heretofore in Mr. Wechs berg's writings, the book is the indispens able, the definitive one for this fascinating musical form and style. Putnam's $15 The Book, the Ring, and the Poet, by William Irvine and Park Honan. Anthony Burgess recently reviewed this work in order to take the opportunity of decimating Browning's reputation. In the process he neglected a fine new biography and did nothing to prove that he had ever read Browning. That an intelligent and tal ented man could think that expressions of outdated critical bigotry are worth atten tion shows a real need for modern critics to analyze the great art of Browning, which is far superior to his "philosophy." This biography does not do much on that score, but it does offer a richness of background for Browning which is a solid contribution to the effort. McGraw-Hill $15 The Extraordinary Mr. Wilkes: His Life and Times, by Louis Kronenberger. It is always useful when a biography ap pears to illuminate the face of one who, for all his interest, was almost lost in the crowd. Eccentric Englishmen of the eighteenth century especially astonish, since they pro vide the contrast of personal anarchy with a still rigid social system. Wilkes is famous for his radical republicanism, his squabbles with royalty, and his fairly successful ex ploitation of the people. But Kronenberg er's book, as poorly written as it is, shows above all the aimlessness of the man apart from the exigencies of business. Doubleday $10 Lord Hervey: Eighteenth-Century Courtier, by Robert Halsband. One of the mainstays of Sir Robert Wal pole's government, a political pamphleteer of exceptional skill, and an intimate of Queen Caroline, Hervey is remembered to day only because Pope took the trouble to draw a devastating satirical portrait of xcii him in the "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot." Mr. Halsband gives us a much more bal anced picture: we see Hervey at the center of public life, loyal to his political party and effective in advancing its causes; we ob serve with sympathy his sexual ambivalence; and we understand the charm and intel ligence which sustained his friendships with people like Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Oxford f12.50 Enid Starkie: A Biography, by Joanna Rich ardson. Enid Starkie was an Irishwoman who made quite a life for herself in the academic circles of Oxford, though she never reached the desired apex of such a career, the ap pointment to the Professorship of French. Her French, by the way, was acquired as a child from a French governess, and strengthened by study at the Sorbonne and through innumerable trips to France. She is still called colorful, but it would be more accurate to say she wore brilliant colors, lived in a house the interiors of which were painted scarlet and gold, and rather bullied people when she didn't get her own way. By her biographer's own admission her scholarly books fell short of complete suc cess, while her efforts at fiction and auto biography were worse. It seems she had never learned to express herself in English, French being her first language, so to speak. What is left? An account of Oxford poli tics, a very "in" subject, a group of en thusiastic students, and, near the end of her life, a tragic dislike on both sides to ward and from her College. It was, indeed, an unresolved life, since poor Enid Starkie could never decide to like what she had and never could get what she thought she liked. Macmillan $7.95 HISTORY Society and Culture in America, 1830-1860, by Rüssel B. Nye. As with his earlier volumes in the New American Nation Series, Nye's latest ex ploration of American society and culture provides an almost encyclopedic survey of developments in fields from art and archi tecture to science, literature, and education. The book reads rapidly and easily and is</page><page sequence="15">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS accompanied by a good bibliography as well as informative footnotes. If the work is to be faulted it can only be for its lack of any underlying theme to hold the material together. Indeed, Nye is conscious of the omission; he neglects to provide a conclu sion. Thus, although the author has ably summarized and listed the multitude of cul tural developments in antebellum America, he has done little to make those develop ments coherent. If one wants a survey of society and culture, this book can be well recommended; if, however, one seeks a syn thesis, he should look elsewhere. Harper &amp; Row $10 The Armies of the Streets: The New York City Draft Riots of 1863, by Adrian Cook. Slightly more than a century before the opposition to the Vietnam War reached its height, draft resisters violently protested the conscription laws of 1863. Motivated by spiraling inflation, disgruntled over the course of the war, racial antipathy, and an occasional class envy toward those who could buy their way out of the army, the protestors violently attacked draft boards and then turned on New York City's blacks. Cook has recreated these grim days of July, 1863, and has attempted to put them into the larger historical context of American violence. His story telling is superb, but his analysis, although suggestive, falls short of expectations. Kentucky $14.50 Crucial American Elections. Volume 99 of the Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society. This volume contains five essays on American presidential elections (1800, by Merrill D. Peterson; 1836, by Joel H. Silbey; i860, by Don E. Fehrenbacher; 1896, by Gilbert C. Fite; and 1936, by Donald R. McCoy) presented at the 1972 symposium. Justification for the selection of these elec tions is based on the criterion that they are "crucial," but there is no clear explication or agreement among the authors as to what this precisely means. The inclusion of the 1800 election is well justified by Peterson who suggests that election established the nation's "first democratic transfer of power," but McCoy's examination of the 1936 elec tion presents it as simply confirming the New Deal coalition started in 1932. The examination of the i860 election concludes this was probably not a "crucial" election. Like many collections of symposium papers this one tends to be very uneven. American Philosophical Society $3 The Jefferson Papers of the University of Virginia, compiled by Constance E. TThur low, Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., John Casteen, and Anne Freudenberg. Thomas Jefferson's correspondence and papers have been called "the richest treasure house of information ever left by a single man." This calendar of one of the important collections of his manuscripts, that of the University of Virginia Library, reveals par ticularly the private man—but a private man who entered into all his activities with such intellectual and physical energy that his papers rank as one of the most valuable sources for the study of nearly all aspects of life in his time. Access to the overwhelm ing riches of the Jefferson papers is con siderably eased by this book. Manuscripts are listed in chronological order with brief descriptions including names of people and places mentioned in them. Part I of the book was first published in 1950 (this en larged photo-offset reproduction is easier to read than the original in smaller type). Part II adds the considerable number of manuscripts acquired by the library since that year, and an excellent index covers both parts. In all respects, this is a fine aid for the researcher. Virginia $25 A Chronology of Virginia and the War of Independence, 1768-1783, by John E. Selby. Virginia played a prominent part in the two decades of revolutionary turmoil in America. In this forty-eight page booklet, John Selby chronologically summarizes the major political, social, and military events of the period. Some of the significant occur rences outside the state are cited in order to bring events of the state into perspective in the overall scene of the era. Virginians as well as visitors to the state's bicentennial attractions will find this a quick and incisive guide to Virginia's rôle in the American Revolution. Three historical maps add to the clarity of the text. Virginia $i.2f xciii</page><page sequence="16">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Travels in the Old South, Selected from Periodicals of the Times, edited by Eugene L. Schwaab. The travel account has long been a staple in the diet of historians seeking an under standing of nineteenth-century society and culture. Thus the publication of these illus trated and handsomely printed volumes will be most welcome. The editor has "combed" numerous antebellum periodicals tb find representative accounts of Southern life. Most of the accounts are by nativè authors and thus provide a counterpoint to the scores of foreign travel books. Unfortu nately, Schwaab has borrowed the awkward chronological organization scheme used in Thomas Clark's guide to travel books and the reader often finds himself making prodi gious geographic leaps about the South. Also unfortunate is the overemphasis on the old Southwest (Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas) at the expense of the upper South. These minor difficulties aside, the volumes provide delightful reading as well as a con siderable amount of valuable contemporary observation. Kentucky 2 vols. $25 British Drums on the Southern Frontier, by Larry E. Ivers. This volume is a detailed analysis of the years 1733-49 when Georgia served as a military buffer colony between Spanish dominated Florida and British South Caro lina. Although primarily a military history, this monograph also looks at Southern fron tier politics, Indian diplomacy, and the mili tary campaigns from the British colonial viewpoint. Obviously, the character and activities of James Oglethorpe are also given particular scrutiny. This is an interesting study by a non-professional historian that covers a crucial, but previously neglected, period of Southern colonial history. Its ap peal will be primarily to professional his torians plus a few general readers especially interested in colonial Georgia or military history. North Carolina $12.50 From Revolution to Revolution: England i688-itj6, by John Carswell. This highly satisfying volume is a well planned, well-executed study which, unlike too many works today, covers exactly what the title says. The first chapter opens with a look at post-revolutionary England, and the last closes with a discussion of Britain on the eve of the American Revolution. In between, Carswell examines the develop ment of Great Britain in politics, business, society, and the arts. There is also an in teresting and valuable chronological table, extending for seventeen pages, which covers these same areas. Although aimed at both the historian and the general reader, it is probably too detailed for all but the most interested of the latter. Scribner's $8.95 Freedom, Corruption, and Government in Elizabethan England, by Joel Hurstfield. In this collection of essays written chiefly during the past decade, Professor Hurstfield demonstrates the value of defining certain key political terms in the context of a past age before applying them to that age. Tudor Englishmen certainly did not have "liberty" in the modern sense, but Professor Hurst field wants to know if they felt deprived of freedom as they understood it. He cites examples to show that a surprisingly large number did feel resentment at being gov erned without their consent. "Corruption" is another word which can be misapplied in discussing Elizabethan England. For ex ample, the author shows that presenting gifts to government officials, so apt to be called "bribery" by moderns, was an ac cepted practice: the gifts compensated for the inadequate pay of civil servants. In their insistence on proper definition, their wealth of telling examples, and their wide range of subjects, these essays reveal a master his torian at work. Harvarden England's Mission: The Imperial Idea in the Age of Gladstone and Disraeli, 1868-1880, by C. C. Eldridge. In the vast literature on imperialism there has been little appreciation of the anteced ents of the late nineteenth-century expan sionist urge. Mr. Eldridge seeks to rectify that lack of appreciation. Beginning with an insightful discussion of Granville's notions of empire as well as those of his critics, the author digresses in the middle chapters to defend Disraeli from his many detractors. For a time the overall thrust of the imperial idea is lost in the discussion of Disraeli. The book concludes with a rather perfunctory xcvi</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS assessment of Gladstone's ideas on empire with suggestions of the impact of both Disraeli and Gladstone on the emerging mission of England. The book frequently challenges the reader with provocative in sights into the nature of the empire but even more frequently loses itself in quotation and digression. In short, it is a rather dis appointing book. North Carolina $10.95 Regicide and Revolution: Speeches at the Trial of Louis XVI, edited by Michael Walzer. This excellent addition to the Cambridge Studies in the History and Theory of Poli tics is almost unique among works in the general field of political theory. Not since Camus has there been a discussion of the profound significance of regicide at the beginnings of modern polities. In this superb introduction, Walzer brings "The Rebel" up-to-date, so to speak, with a very probing and thought-provoking essay on regicide. The particular speeches selected by Walzer are well chosen and do not reflect a random process, but rather point toward a fuller understanding of the problems of justice involved in the historical act. The brief introductions to these speeches by Walzer and the excellent footnotes will be of con siderable assistance to the serious student. Highly recommended for any scholar in terested in political theory and intellectual history. Cambridge $12.50 Spain: The Rise of the First World Power, by John Fraser Ramsey. There is something slightly misleading about the title of this initial volume in a new series on Mediterranean Europe, for it will be recalled that the Prophet Daniel listed four world powers and after them came the Romans. But in modern history Spain does lead the way, and what Pro fessor Ramsey of the University of Alabama treats in this substantial and useful book is essentially the Spanish preparation for em pire. About a third of his pages is devoted to the medieval evolution of the turbulent, separatistic, multicultural peoples of Castile and Aragon, with noteworthy treatment of the basic but usually neglected (because less dramatic) years between 1250 and 1469. But the book's true focus is upon the reign of Isabella and Ferdinand, with particular at tention to the dynastic, administrative, re ligious, military, and diplomatic policies that created the monarchy which Charles V and Philip II were subsequently to lead to the domination of Europe and the conquest of America. The author assembles abundant information here in the light of the recent scholarly advances in this field, but never for long loses sight of its human meaning. Indeed his acute, sensible, refreshing anal yses of often hotly controversial subject matter make this study a richly instructive guide to the traditionally misunderstood age of Spain's entrance upon the stage of mod ern world history. Alabama $10.50 The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, Volume II, by Fernand Braudel. This concluding installment of what ranks as probably the chief masterpiece of twen tieth-century historical scholarship moves beyond the broad panorama of Mediterra nean landscapes, ways of life, trade routes, price revolutions, and rural and urban econ omies presented in its predecessor to ex amine first such topics as the nature of the early modern, inherently imperialist state; the social structures and internal social con flicts of the second half of the sixteenth cen tury; the Mediterranean cultures—Christian and non-Christian (particularly interesting as regards the Spanish Moriscos and the Jews); and the forms of warfare in an age of ubiquitous bellicosity. Then, from the vantage point of the Habsburg Spain of Philip II, with its far-reaching international commitments, Braudel follows the vast struggle between the Spanish and Ottoman Turkish Empires which centers about the great inland sea. In one sense this is a famil iar enough tale, the bitterly divided Europe of the Counter Reformation saved by Spain's self-sacrifice from falling into vas salage to an alien Eastern authoritarianism. But Braudel powerfully renews and enriches the whole story out of his extensive archival researches, and above all by his inexhaust ible acuteness and originality of interpreta tion. It is a cause for genuine satisfaction that at last, a quarter of a century after its first publication in France, this great and noble work has been made available to the xcvii</page><page sequence="18">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS English-reading public in Siân Reynolds' ex cellent translation. Harper &amp; Row $17.50 NATIONAL &amp; INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Economics and the Public Purpose, by John Kenneth Galbraith. This work sustains Galbraith's reputation as an economist critical of much contem porary economic analysis, but his proposed reforms are not very original or construc tive. He regards this book as the third in a trilogy of serious expositions of the nature of our economy. In "The Affluent Society" he showed the consequences of private afflu ence and public parsimony. "The New In dustrial State" dealt with the economic necessity and dominance of the giant cor porations which he labels the planning sec tor of the economy. The central theme of this new volume is the large sector of the economy in which small businesses, the service industries, and the arts operate. In this sector the influence of the consumer upon demand and supply is important. Galbraith emphasizes that the unequal de velopment of the two major sectors of the economy is unrelated to need, and that inequality in their income bears no neces sary relation to productivity and efficiency. Both inequalities are a result of the unequal deployment of power and both prove to be socially damaging. He finds that private and bureaucratic power is the decisive force in economic and political life, not consumer demand, and that "Left to themselves, eco nomic forces do not work out for the best except perhaps for the powerful." Political mechanisms must be used to reform the economy. Instability and inflation which are endemic to the system can only be con tained by more economic activity by gov ernment. The reforms Galbraith advocates include socialization of weak economic sec tors such as mass transportation and hous ing, and more governmental planning and co-ordination of the various "planning sys tems" at the national and international levels. Professor Galbraith hopes that gov ernments will be imbued with, and capable of discerning, the "public purpose" in their management of economic affairs, but the evidence he offers in this book does little to sustain such optimism. Rather, the evidence before us underscores the weaknesses and inadequacies of states large and small, de veloped and developing, in coping with their responsibilities in our complex world. Our numerous international organizations reflect the weaknesses of their members and consequently are also often lacking in the capacity to ameliorate the situation when dealing with the many problems which are now global in nature. In any case, Galbraith demonstrates that our contemporary eco nomics offers little guidance in these mat ters, and that the burden is shifted to the realm of political creativity. Houghton Mifflin fio Court and Constitution in the Twentieth Century: The Modern Interpretation, by William F. Swindler. This up-to-date interpretation of the Constitution, line by line and clause by clause, is the concluding volume in Swin dler's three-volume study of the Constitu tion. The format of this study invites com parison with Corwin's classical treatise on the same subject. Swindler has not slavishly followed the lead of Corwin, but has branched out into his own style of con stitutional commentary. He has included a number of historical sketches on the various amendments. The book is recent enough to contain several references to Sirica v. Nixon and other Watergate-related matters that apply to the Constitution today. This is a well written and easily readable treat ment. Bobbs-Merrill f 12.95 The Bureaucratization of the World, by Henry Jacoby. Mr. Jacoby offers in this short book an analysis of the growth of bureaucracy in the world breathtaking in its sweeping quality. There is little originality in a study seemingly intended as a popularization of much of the literature. What is remarkable in this attempt, however, is his heavy re liance on sociological and philosophical studies and virtual ignorance of studies by students of public administration. Moreover, students of sociology and political philos ophy are likely to be put off by his sum mary treatment of the seminal figures of their fields. Nonetheless, the study provides C</page><page sequence="19">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS a useful introduction to the problem of how to achieve efficiency without stultification in a modern bureaucratic world. California f12.95 Berliners: Both Sides of the Wall, by Anne Armstrong. Vivid vignettes of the lives of both East and West Berliners make up this unusual contemporary history of Berlin. Through extensive interviews with students, profes sors, pastors, workers, government officials, communists, National Socialists, and other Berliners, the author captures the frustra tion and exhilaration of life in this unique city. Graphic flashbacks tell of the inter viewees' struggles during and just after the war—such as one woman's involvement in the abortive assassination attempt on Hitler. Rutgers $12.50 U.D.I.: The International Politics of the Rhodesian Rebellion, by Robert C. Good. Mr. Good was United States ambassador to Zambia at the time of the "unilateral declaration of independence" by Rhodesia in late 1965 and observed the events which Ereceded and followed from that act until e left his post in Africa in December, 1968. He discussed with great thoroughness these events and brings his discussion up to the proposed settlement between Britain and Rhodesia in November, 1971. He is not only interested in the troubled relationship between Great Britain and Rhodesia and within the Commonwealth, but he is also concerned with the impact of these events on the West generally. He believes that failure to achieve a transition toward ma jority rule in Rhodesia has hardened racial attitudes and alienated Africa from the West. Princeton f 12.50 Radical Politics in South Asia, edited by Paul R. Brass and Marcus F. Franda. In a region as burdened with massive poverty as is South Asia one would expect that political parties offering radical solu tions would enjoy great popularity and quickly achieve power. Yet the parties of die radical left have experienced only occa sional victories of short duration and have in fact encountered major difficulties. In this excellent, authoritative study Paul Brass sets the historical and analytical framework and contributes a chapter on one of the Indian regions, Bihar. Following the re gional approach, Robert Hardgrave presents a chapter on the Kerala Communists, Marcus Franda examines the complexities of radical politics in West Bengal, and Mohan Ram deals with the Communist movement in Andhra Pradesh. The rôle of radical parties in the emergence of Bangla desh is covered by Talukder Maniruzzaman, and Robert Kearney explains the frustra tions of the unique radical parties of Ceylon (Sri Lanka). The authors are concerned not only to account for successes and failures, but also to uncover sources of political leadership, the bases of mass appeal, the nature and effectiveness of the parties as organizations, the extent of their participa tion in parliamentary governments, and their rôles in situations of turmoil and mas sive unrest in the subcontinent. MIT $15 Face to Face with Asia, by Pierre Mendès France. Pierre Mendès France, former prime min ister in the French Fourth Republic and a key figure in the settlement of the French Indo-Chinese War in 1954, recounts here his impressions of a recent trip to Asia in late 1971 and early 1972. M. Mendès France spoke with a wide variety of statesmen, educators, industrialists, politicians, and pro fessional people in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Burma, and India and came away with a remarkably well informed account of some of the forces now sweeping Asia. His conversation with Chou En-lai prior to President Nixon's visit to China elucidates some of the perspectives and expectations of the Chinese leadership. M. Mendès France shows again the shrewd insight for which he was known in the fifties. Liveright $8.95 People's China and International Law: A Documentary Study, by Jerome Alan Cohen and Hungdah Chiu. Professors Cohen and Chiu have pre sented in these two volumes a compre hensive collection of Chinese documents, articles, speeches, and selections from schol arly treatises, relating to the position of the People's Republic of China on the major ci</page><page sequence="20">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS questions of public international law. The anthology is accompanied by detailed notes and commentaries and is preceded by an extremely useful introduction to China's notion of and experience with international law. Given the debate about the extent to which China can adapt to the contractual concept of Western-based law, these vol umes are most timely and likely to be a definitive source for scholarship for some years to come. Princeton two vols. $60 GENERAL Between Science and Religion: The Re action to Scientific Naturalism in Late Vic torian England, by Frank Miller Turner. This is an imposing, readable, and much needed contribution to modern intellectual history. The focus is on six eminent Vic torian men of science, philosophy, and let ters—Frederick Myers, George Romanes, Alfred Wallace, Henry Sidgwick, Samuel Butler, and James Ward. The drama of this study is in their search for a spiritual life amidst the ruins of nineteenth-century Christianity and the spiritual void of the rising scientific spirit. It was a crisis of moral values that is still with us and we recognize today as the growth of modern nihilism. As yet there is no collective answer to this problem that is widely acceptable, but the individual responses of these men form a part of the contemporary world that is still with us. They deserve to be read and understood. Yale $12.50 The Science of Religion and the Sociology of Knowledge: Some Methodological Ques tions, by Ninian Smart. There is a difference between theology and the contemporary academic study of religion in departments of religious studies. This stimulating brief study is not theology. It is rather an account of the way academi cians view religion from the outside look ing in. Professor Smart is sympathetic to the religious impulse in persons and recognizes that such longings and desires deserve to be treated respectfully and with genuine reverence. Accordingly, what we might refer to as religious values deserves an autonomous place in the sociology of knowledge, to be set apart from other forms of human knowledge. The argument of this study is concise, lucid, and touched with a gentleness that has at long last begun to reassert itself in the study of religion. But in the last analysis, there really can be no science of religion, only theology. Princeton tS.50 American Religious Thoughts: A History, by William A. Clebsch. This volume in the Chicago History of American Religion is a most deceptive con tribution to the historical literature. It is short (205 pages), and seemingly its focus on three seminal religious thinkers (Jon athan Edwards, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and William James) would make it simple. Rather, the book is a subtle description of the shift of American religious thought from the colonial period to the twentieth century. Edwards personifies the Ameri can Calvinist, while Emerson is the embodi ment of the mid-nineteenth-century roman tic. James, with his modern psychological concerns, ushers in the twentieth century. Each major essay is coupled with transi tional discussions of such theologians as Nathaniel Taylor, Charles G. Finney, Henry Beecher, and the Niebuhrs. For all its virtue of compactness and capable synthesis of a complex subject, the book loses some of its impact with a rather turgid prose. Chicago $6.95 Dissent in American Religion, by Edwin Scott Gaustad. Because American religion was founded in dissent, the country has witnessed a long history of dissenters. Gaustad groups those dissenters in three broad areas—schismatics, heretics, and misfits. There were the pious schismatics, who withdrew: the secular heretics who repeatedly harped but were often ignored; and there were misfits who were nearly always ridiculed and frequently expelled. Each form of dissent represents a strand of thought rooted in the pious, evan gelical, and libertarian tradition that has characterized the American religious mind. Gaustad's summary is based on a reading of secondary materials and his brief text ( 154 pages), if not original, is nearly always provocative. This volume in the Chicago History of American Religion is certainly a welcome contribution. Chicago #6.95 cii</page><page sequence="21">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS Victorian Stage Pulpiteer, by Alan P. Barr. Mr. Barr has produced a much needed and eminently sensible critical text on the religious aspects of George Bernard Shaw's life and work. Shaw, of course, loved to preach, but he chose politics and the theater as his pulpits. Being a man of wit as well as a man of brilliance, he also chose to formu late his theology outside that of the estab lished church. Mr. Barr examines Shaw's background of Victorian Christianity, as well as his developed theology, and relates the two in a masterpiece of logic. Georgia $8.50 The Sociology of Emile Dürkheim, by Robert A. Nisbet. There can be little doubt, as Nisbet points out in his preface, that along with Max Weber, Dürkheim is one of the dominant influences in the contemporary study of sociology. In this excellent introduction to the thought of Dürkheim, Nisbet, a dis tinguished scholar in his own right, has given us a welcome contribution to under standing one of the most fruitful minds that has helped to form the structure of modern social sciences. Above all, it was Durk heim's insistence that reality exists apart from the subjectivity of individual thought that Nisbet believes will constitute the great Frenchman's lasting contribution. Nisbet shares with the subject of his study the no tion that this subjectivity is the end of the social sciences, not their beginning. Oxford fç.pï Across the Frontiers, by Werner Heisen berg. Robert Lowell once noted with pleasure that he had met a scientist who could both think and speak. Heisenberg's ability to use both the language of science and that of men is of extreme importance at a time when the schism between math and hu manity has grown huge and dangerous. Heisenberg's essays in this book, published as part of the World Perspective series, do much to show the necessity and the pos sibility of bridging that nauseous gap. His background in German culture and the history of philosophy gives him the kind of advantage for this sort of work which all too many American scientists lack, to our great shame. Harper ér Row tl-95 civ Montesquieu's Philosophy of Liberalism: A Commentary on the Spirit of the Laws, by Thomas L. Pangle. Because the structure of the "Spirit of the Laws" is not easily discernible, this work has often been dismissed as a collection of inconsistencies without a central teaching. With brilliance and clarity Professor Pangle demonstrates the relationship between Mon tesquieu's form of political writing and the substantive teachings. Montesquieu, in agree ment with Hobbes, viewed the purpose of government as self-preservation and free dom for its citizens. Liberal republicanism, he held, best promotes these ends. Pangle's brilliant explication is of monumental im portance for the study of the roots of liberal democracy and the teachings of Montes quieu. Furthermore, Pangle demonstrates to the serious student how political philosophy should be studied. Chicago $10 Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View, by Stanley Milgram. Mr. Milgram's study is a remarkable in quiry into the conditions that lead either to blind obedience or to defiance. In a series of experiments he asks subjects to admin ister electric shocks of apparently increasing severity to protesting victims. An unusual number of subjects continued to apply these shocks at the command of the experimenter who had retained them despite the vehe ment pleading of the apparent victim. The willingness of a goodly number of people to carry out instructions despite conflicts of conscience raises disturbing questions about the conditions necessary for the main tenance of a free people. This study should be of interest both to social scientists and the general public. Harper &amp; Row $10 Frontier Violence, by W. Eugene Hollon. It is the plausible hypothesis of this work that violence—rising out of the frustrations of mining camp and settlement—was en demic on the American frontier, but that the frontier was no more violent than the rest of American society. Hollon's point is doubtless well-taken, but his narrative does little to justify his conclusion. Rather, the book is a chronicle of violence on the American frontier from the harassment of Mexicans in Texas to Chinese baiting on</page><page sequence="22">SOLZHENITSYN "I think that few people having read this book would be the same as when they opened its first page.

Only the last chapter reminds us that the violence has been exaggerated and frequently taken out of proper perspective. Hollon's fascination with recreating the violent West has seriously undermined his laudable thesis, one that would have brought the Western experi ence into a national perspective on violence. In short, the book provides interesting read ing but has a disappointing argument. Oxford $7.95 America in Legend: Folklore from the Colonial Period to the Present, by Richard M. Dorson. The first task in reading this book is to get past the blurb on the dust cover which states that the study of American folklore is only thirty years old and "Dorson is its father, son and holy ghost"—trickster figure might be more appropriate! Beyond the introductory material the book is divided into four sections: The Colonial Period, The Early National Period (bounded by the Revolution and the Civil War), The Later National Period (1860's to 1960's), and The Contemporary Period (1964 to present). The first section deals almost ex clusively with New England and depends for source material primarily on the works of Cotton and Increase Mather. The second section is organized around the exploits of five "folk heroes"—Davy Crockett, Mike Fink, Sam Patch, Mose the Bowery b'hoy, and Yankee Jonathan. The "folk hero" status of some of these characters is dubious, to say the least, and Dorson depends largely on the popular media for material. The third section is organized on the basis of occupational groups—Cowboys, Lumber jacks, Miners, Oil Drillers, and Railroaders. Here, Dorson depends less on printed sources and fictional works—especially in dealing with lumberjacks, an area in which he has done some collecting—though he ignores some excellent work, such as "Only a Miner," by Archie Green. The final sec tion represents the contemporary scene with druglore and tales of draft dodgers. The book is uneven in quality. There is emphasis on certain geographic areas in some sections to the exclusion of others; em phasis on certain groups to the exclusion of others (e.g., blacks); and emphasis on some kinds of lore to the exclusion of others CV</page><page sequence="23">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS (druglore is not the only folklore on the contemporary scene). It is difficult to make a general, summary statement, but one can say that Dorson's book comes remarkably close to the "bankrupt treasuries" of folk lore edited by Benjamin Botkin that have received the criticism and scorn of Dorson over the years! Pantheon $15 Folklore and the Sea, by Horace Beck. Man's ancestors came from the sea and man has been trying these many generations to go back. The sea has inspired, perhaps, the largest body of folklore extant and Horace Beck brings together a large slice of it in this book. Beck is a sailor himself— as well as folklorist and professor of Ameri can literature at Middlebury College—and is one of a few individuals uniquely quali fied to write such a book. He begins his story, as one must, with the lore connected with ship-building and proceeds to cover place names, weather lore, sea songs, super stitions, legends, and other aspects of sea lore. Over thirty years have been spent in collecting material for this book. It is well researched, has an extensive bibliography, and a comprehensive index. If you are in terested in the sea—read this book. Wesley an $14.95 Hunters of the Northern Forest, by Richard K. Nelson. The saga of the struggle for survival by the Kutchin Indians is faithfully reported by an anthropologist who spent a year in their wilderness of east-central Alaska. This book is interesting reading for the amateur naturalist and ecologist as well as the scholar and professional historian. Chicago $10.50 The Writer and the Shaman: A Morphol ogy of the American Indian, by Elemire Zolla. An intensive study of white attitudes toward the Red man has revealed that the concept of progress has been the principal agent of pogroms against the Indians. More damage was done to Indian culture by the missionaries and sociologists who posed as friends than by politicians or the army. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $12.50 cvi A Destroying Angel: The Conquest of Smallpox in Colonial Boston, by Ola Eliza beth Winslow. Medical historians and students of public health will doubtless be excited by the pos sibilities that a book of this title offers. Case studies of disease control are all too rare in the literature. However, readers will be somewhat disappointed. Although the au thor properly recounts the problems of smallpox as it confronted a divided medical "profession," and discusses the gradual and controversial adoption of inoculation as a preventive measure, she spends more time on short biographical sketches of individuals who played a rôle in the ultimate conquest of smallpox. Her discussions of Cotton Mather, Zabdiel Boylston, and Benjamin Waterhouse (Bostonians who argued for in oculation and later vaccination) are wel come but somewhat distracting, as are the relatively long essays on Lady Mary Wort ley Montagu or on Samuel Jenner. Indeed without the eighteen pages devoted to these latter persons, the text would have been less than a hundred pages and one suspects that it might have better been published as a long article than as a short book. Houghton Mifflin $5.95 Oxford Slavonic Papers, New Series, Vol ume VI, edited by Robert Auty, J. L. I. Fennell, and I. P. Foote. Volume VI of the New Series maintains the high standards of scholarship and edit ing that will be familiar to readers of "Ox ford Slavonic Papers." This issue contains pieces on topics such as Russian revolution aries in England in the nineteenth century, Preseren's German poems, Slovene dialects since World War II, the reception of Eng lish literature in Russia during the 1870's—a veritable feast. Pride of place goes to an article on Esenin's visit to America during the winter of 1922-23, accompanied by the divine Isadora Duncan.

In this thor oughly engrossing book subtitled "a study of convention in the theatre and in social life," Ms. Burns demonstrates how such a vocabulary is used; terms such as "com posed behavior," "authenticating conven tions," and "role theory" illuminate the often murky world of theatrical perform ance theory. It may well be from the sci ence of sociology that a clear understand ing of what theatre is finally emerges. This study is highly recommended as an intro duction to the fairly new sub-discipline of the sociology of the theatre. Harper &amp; Row $6 Lunatics, Lovers &amp; Poets, by Margaret Croyden. In writing a book on current experi mental theatre movements, the danger is that it may become a rehash of TDR back issues. Ms. Croyden avoids this pitfall by bringing personal experience and scholarly sophistication to her study, one whose thoroughness should give it space on any theatre bookshelf.

McGraw-Hill $9.95 Dictionary of Contemporary Music, edited by John Vinton. Various aspects of the contemporary musical scene are included in this informa tive and interesting work: composers who were born after 1880 and/or lived after 1930, styles and compositional procedures, technical terms and special subjects, and sur veys by country and genre. For practical reasons coverage is restricted to "concert music in the Western tradition" and to composers whose works have received pub lic attention through performance, record ings, and publication. The attention and re spect of fellow composers also figured in the choice of entries, according to the editor, who also states that in the case of living cvii 3)/.SU thor- n study in social w</page><page sequence="25">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS composers most of the information was ob tained from the composers themselves. In the articles on special subjects attention is centered on what is new or distinctive in this century. Many entries are signed, which adds to the interest, particularly in the treat ment of recent musical phenomena, where personal bias or interpretation has not yet had time to become absorbed in a tradi tional approach. The inclusion of publishers in the bibliographies of composers' works is very helpful. Button $25 Thomas Jefferson and Music, by Helen Cripe. It is customary for anyone dealing with Jefferson to record his interest in music and the fact that he played a violin, yet very few ever tried to assemble available data from his correspondence referring to music and establish a clearer picture of his in volvement in this art. The author of this book has undertaken to remedy this de ficiency and in a few well-organized chap ters presents existing evidence and refer ences to music illustrating not only his interest in music but also his attitude toward the rôle of music in the education of his de scendants. The author has also investigated the fate of his musical instruments and pre sents a brief listing of the remnants of Jeff erson's collection of music, both printed editions and manuscripts copied for his use and that of his family. It is obvious from the outset that the author is not a musical scholar but an amateur who is well trained in research techniques and who satisfies the desire of professional historians with foot notes referring to Jefferson's correspon dence and account books. The author's style is engaging and offers a smooth reading. Yet for a scholar interested in the history of music and musical events there are far too many frustrating moments, such as when the author simply mentions that during Jeff erson's stay in France Patsy "kept him in formed of her progress and of the pieces she was playing . . ." without citing the text, which would be of prime importance to know what it was that Patsy played. In short, although scholarly in appearance this is not a book of great value for musicolo gists. As a fascinated amateur, the author has, without sufficient background and in formation, tackled a formidable subject. She cviii has prepared a popular booklet which has enough charm for the general public but which fails to provide as full a picture as might be desired of Jefferson and his love affair with the Art of Music. Such a vol ume has yet to be written. Virginia $7.50; paper $3.7$ The Early Comic Strip, by David Kunzle. By early Mr. Kunzle means c. 1450 to 1825, and by comic strip he means a broad sheet which contains a sequence of images, has a preponderance of image over text, has been printed in a mass medium, and con tains a topical moral narrative. This is the first of a projected multi-volume history and a very handsome book it is. He has treated the subject in a solid, scholarly way, he has presented much neglected informa tion, and he has been fully explanatory in both captions and text. The great format of the book (folio) and the multitude of il lustrations are both, unhappily, a little meagre for the subject, for the greedy reader will wish for more and more detailed reproductions, especially of the baroque, engraved originals, so that the quality of the plates might have been seen more clearly. The quality of the "comic strips," by the way, ranges from very folk art to the high est of fine art and the two seem to have existed almost side by side. The subjects are rather less frivolous than ours—religion, crime, follies, caricatures, and politics— though, of course, we are still very strong in political strips. The book is a triumph and one only hopes the publisher will be en couraged to present the remainder of this careful, splendid history. California $35 Visions in Stone: The Sculpture of William Edmondson, by Edmund L. Fuller. This spring a great folk art exhibition is touring the country. One might call such art instinctual art as opposed to art of more cerebral values based on more formal train ing. The images which result from the prac tice of folk art often (but not always by any means) have a pleasing simplicity and a naive freshness but are rarely profound. The exhibition more than proves the point. This is also the case with the sculpture of Wil liam Edmondson. His figures strain to emerge from the stone as the most ancient and primitive of sculpture does.

Only a reviewer trained in the habits of thought of Sufism (a system of Moham medan mysticism developed, especially in Persia, into an elaborate symbolism) could justly comprehend this book, for its ap proach to the Sufi architecture of Iran is based on the elaborations of religion. What one can understand—and agree with—is that there is unity in multiplicity, and that the elements of design, space, shape, sur face, color, and matter may be brought into play to support this concept. The book is most persuasive and the illustrations are very supportive of the text. Even when seeing the buildings and complexes which are treated here in situ, one senses that there are layers of meaning hidden from those with Western habits of thought. Now these layers have been revealed, but within a con cept so alien to the West that they are still indefinite in outline. Chicago $17.50 Victorian Houses: A Treasury of Lesser Known Examples, by Edmund V. Gillon, Jr. and Clay Lancaster. The excellent Dover Publications have issued another album of architectural in terest at an unbelievably low price. It con tains 116 illustrations pertinent to the title, all full pages (10" X 11 Vi"), and its fine photography is beautifully reproduced. One might quarrel with the individual choices of the houses, or even with bits of information in the captions, but the book represents sound, even astonishing value, not only eco nomically, but esthetically, since it is a top notch examplar of this lively, vigorous, bold, and widespread heritage. Dover $3.50 Le Cor busier and the Tragic View of Architecture, by Charles Jencks. Despite the portentous title, this is an eminently sensible, sensitive, compact, and readable reassessment of the architect. Dur ing his lifetime, adulation obscured any sort of balanced judgment of his immense achievements. Mr. Jencks' own adulation is no less intense than that of earlier writers, but it has not blinded him to the purposes and the realities of his subject. CX This less heated and slightly more distant perspective results in an image of greater rather than less complexity, of richer rather than poorer achievement, and of more pro found rather than more slight intellectual distinction. This is the fifth book on archi tecture for Mr. Jencks, who was born in 1939. He seems well on the way to being a leader in the new generation of architectural writers.

One cannot imagine a better visual recreation of the city during the second half of the nineteenth century.

The present text is a re shaping of another television series, which in itself was a reshaping of a series of essays written over a long period of time. The universality of the subject and its mysteri ous corners are brilliantly illuminated, the classical rationalism and intuitive roman ticism present in all of us as in all artists are clearly defined and judged, while the four teen artists forming the titular subjects of the essays are made vivid and fresh again. It is a notable achievement. But then Lord Clark has a notable mind. Harper &amp; Row $15</page></plain_text>
