<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CARIBBEAN WRITER AND EXILE JAN CAREW Northwestern University There was a traditional format in the classical Akan theatre around which all drama-comedy, tragedy, farce-evolved. The important features of this drama were these: there was an archetypal middle-man and on either side of him were power- ful spirits opposing one another. The figure in the middle often stood between malevolent and benign spirits of the ancestral dead, and a host of other spirits that were urbane or demonic, creative or destructive, compassionate or cruel, surrogates of the living or the dead, ethereal or earthy, part saint, part trickster. These spirits were involved in eternal conflicts which could only be resolved if the human being periodically renewed contact with communal wellsprings of rhythm, creation, and life. The Caribbean writer today is a creature balanced between limbo and nothingness, exile abroad and homelessness at home, between the people on the one hand and the creole and the colonizer on the other. Exile can be voluntary or it can be imposed by stress of circumstances; it can be a punishment or a pleasure. The exile can leave home for a short time or he can be expelled forever. The colonizing zeal of the European made indigenous peoples exiles in their own countries- Prospero made Caliban an exile in his. The Caribbean writer, by going abroad, is in fact searching for an end to exile. JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES, Vol. 8 No. 4, June 1978 ? 1978 Sage Publications, Inc. [453]</page><page sequence="2">[454] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 This, at first, appears to be a contradiction until one lays bare some of the truths of Caribbean life. The Caribbean person is subjected to successive waves of cultural alienation from birth-a process that has its origins embedded in a mosaic of cultural fragments-Amerindian, African, Euro- pean, Asian. The European fragment is brought into sharper focus than the others, but it remains a fragment. Hiding behind the screen of this European cultural fragment the Caribbean writer oscillates in and out of sunlight and shadows, exile abroad and homelessness at home. At home, he is what C.L.R. James described very aptly as a "twentieth century man living in a seventeenth century economy" (1972), while abroad he is a performer in a circus of civilization. The term Caribbean in this essay describes the island ar- chipelago, the countries on the Caribbean littoral and Guyana, Surinam and Cayenne. Cuba is the exception that proves the rule. Cuba belongs to the Cubans. In Cuba, the northeastern sheet anchor of the Caribbean archipelago, the prerevo- lutionary economic relationship between expatriate owners, local surrogates, and the majority of people no longer exists. Cuba is, therefore, a point of reference for us, a living example of how, in less than two decades, age-old problems of economic and cultural alienation, race and color, caste, class and identity can be looked at afresh and in many instances successfully dealt with. The early accounts written by European colonizers, about their apocalyptic intrusion into the Amerindian domains, are characterized, with few exceptions, by romantic evasions of truth and voluminous omissions. Have we ever really examined the images that these historical fictions have created of us? If we do so empirically, then we can begin to understand this question of exile abroad and homelessness at home, of the writer. After Columbus and his sailors were discovered by the Arawakian Lucayos on their beaches in 1492, the Americas of the colonizer came into being as part of both a literary exercise</page><page sequence="3">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [455] and one of the most appalling acts of ethnocide in recorded history. First, there were Columbus's diaries (the first literary offering of the interlopers), which told us more about the man, himself, than about the islands he had stumbled upon; and the man revealed to us was a schizoid being, a Janus astride two worlds, one medieval, the other of the Renaissance. These diaries are a blend of fantasies fed by writings from the Middle Ages; obsessive ramblings about a new crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the infidel Turks; special pleadings to the sovereigns of Castile; a precise sailor's log and useful scientific observations about the flora, fauna, and topography of the lands visited. His writings about the people he met are con- tradictory, inaccurate, biased, and in the midst of pious declarations about converting "natives" to Christianity, sprinkled with asides of racial arrogance and a lust for gold. Alberigo Vespucci-and I deliberately use his authentic Christian name-a Florentine dilettante and rascal, corrected Columbus's error (Columbus believed he had discovered a new route to the Indies), if error it really was, because Columbus and Vespucci remained on very close and friendly terms until the former's death in 1506. Vespucci, having sailed to the American mainland declared that what Columbus had indeed stumbled upon was a new world-a surprising declaration about twin continents which had already been inhabited for over two hundred milleniums! Having returned from his travels, Vespucci wrote a number of letters to the Duc de Medici in Paris, using a lively and entertaining prose style and causing a great stir when these letters were published. Columbus's writings are intense, humorless, turgid, occa- sionally poetic. The intensity of his passions seemed to burn through the dense prose and illuminate it for moments, until once again it becomes unven, repetitive and dense-the culminative effect of what is left of his writing (most of the originals have been lost) is like fists drumming against one's brain. Vespucci, on the other hand, composing his Quatuor Navigationes (c. 1504-1505) [Marcou, 1888a: 12] in Portugal,</page><page sequence="4">[4561 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 did not write in the white heat of his experiences. He gave us an elegant, retrospective, and very persuasive view, and he was never averse to plagiarism if the accounts of other people's voyages could enhance his own. Vespucci invented a coloni- zer's America, and the reality that is ours never recovered from this literary assault and the distortions he inflicted upon it. The fiction of a "virgin land" inhabited by savages, at once a racist one and a contradiction, remains with us to this day. Amerigo was undoubtedly a Florentine dilettante, but he was also an extraordinarily clever one. Why would he otherwise have changed his Christian name after his voyages to the Americas? There is a mountain range in Nicaragua called the Sierra Amerrique, and a group of Indians called Los Amerriques. These mountains stretch between Juigalpa and Libertad in the province of Chontales, and they separate Lake Nicaragua from the Mosquito Coast. The Amerriques had, since pre-Colum- bian times, always been in contact with the area around Cape Garcia a Dios and the whole length of the Mosquito Coast (Marcou, 1888b: 8). In 1502, Columbus visited this coast at Carriai and Carambaru. In 1497, Vespucci landed at Cape Garcia a Dios, and, in 1505, sailed along the Mosquito Coast. Both navigators must certainly have heard the word "Amerique" from the Indians over and over again during those voyages. After the initial greetings and the limping exchange of pleasantries, it was a tradition with explorers like Columbus and Vespucci-they confirm this repeatedly in their writings- to ask the Indians where gold could be found. For, as Cortes confessed, they all suffered from a disease that only gold could cure. The alluvial gravels of the Sierra Amerrique had yielded gold for the Indians from time immemorial. They used gold, the sun's sweat, to create objects of surpassing beauty. It was a good metal for sculpture. Beyond that it had little value in itself until it was touched by man's creative genius. By capturing light on the burnished surfaces that metal workers and sculptors created through the use of fire, gold could link</page><page sequence="5">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [457] people to the sun, moon, and stars, and both the act of creative labor and the object created became touched by magic, mystery, and beauty. Sometimes they indented pieces of raw gold, and putting them in a sack full of sand, allowed the sea or a running stream to sculpt and polish them, and so through these processes the objects, man, Nature, and the gods could become one. For the colonizer gold meant money, personal and national aggrandizement, and power over others. In their burgeoning capitalist system, gold could buy a place in the very Throne Room of the Kingdom of Heaven for the most despicable sinner. And in particular, once this sinner made the right propitiatory noises to the Almighty and gave generously to the Church, he could be assured of absolution from any crime committed against the colonized. "I came for gold, not to till the land," Cortez had declared. He was noted for his occasional outbursts of brutal frankness about himself and his country- men. Their lust for gold was such that the Indians declared that the colonizer would even rape the sun to rob it of its miraculous sweat. For Columbus and Vespucci, therefore, the words "Amer- rique" and "gold" become synonymous. After his visits to the Mosquito Coast, he made the last one in 1505, Vespucci changed his Christian name from Alberico to Amerigo. In the archives of Toledo, a letter from Vespucci to the Cardinal dated December 9, 1508, is signed Amerrigo with the double "r" as in the Indian Amerrique (Marcou, 1888c: 79). And between 1508 and 1512, the year in which Vespucci died, at least two other signatures with the Christian name Amerrigo were recorded. Robbing peoples and countries of their indigenous names was one of the cruel games that colonizers played with the colonized. Names are like magic markers in the long and labyrinthine streams of racial memory, for racial memories are rivers leading to the sea where the memory of mankind is stored. To rob people or countries of their name is to set</page><page sequence="6">[458] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 in motion a psychic disturbance which can in turn create a permanent crisis of identity. As if to underline this fact, the theft of an important placename from the heartland of the Americas and the claim that it was a dilettante's Christian name robs the original name of its elemental meaning. Dr. A. Le Plongeon, a nineteenth century scholar from Merida (Yucatan), in a letter to the French Professor Jules Marcou dated December 10, 1881, wrote: The name AMERICA OR AMERRIQUE in the Mayan language means a country of perpetually strong wind, or the Land of the Wind, and sometimes the suffix "-ique", "-ik" and "-ika" can mean not only wind or air but also a spirit that breathes, life itself [Marcou, 1888d: 6]. We must, therefore, reclaim the name of our America and give it once again its primordial meaning, land of the wind, the fountainhead of life and movement. In the -Myan genesis myth, the Popol Vuh, Wind stands at the center of creation. As the story unfolds, we are told that it was manifested to the gods: That at dawn man should appear. So they decided on the creation and the growth of trees and bees and the birth of life and the creation of man. This was resolved in the darkness and in the night by the Heart of Heaven called Huricane [Paz, 1972a]. On the rocky eastern slopes of the Sierra Amerrique the wind pounds like giant fists upon the gates of time demanding to be recognized. The absence of greed for the property of others is definitely not a quality that has surfaced in the hearts of colonizers during the five centuries of the Columbian era. After the five Kingdoms of Hispaniola and their estimated three million inhabitants were erased, the peoples of Jamaica and Puerto Rico were next in line for theirjourney to oblivion.</page><page sequence="7">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [459] By 1540 these two islands, which between them had a popula- tion of six hundred thousand, could boast of having hardly 200 of their original inhabitants alive. The population figures are those of Las Casas and, naturally, apologists for the colonizer have often warned us that his figures should be doubted. But who should be believed, the initiators, sponsors, and apologists of ethnocide, or one who fought for its victims for sixty-eight of his ninety-two years. The silences and the empty spaces which remained in the wake of this early example of a final solution bore eloquent testimony to the enormity of the crime. Even if the figures are incorrect we might well ask where then are the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean today? Why don't they come forward and speak for them- selves? I have penetrated into those profound silences which remain in the aftermath of ethnocide, for it is not only a crime of past centuries, it lives on today. In vast areas of the Guyana highlands west of the Pakaraimas and south of the Akarai, the Amerindian peoples are still being exterminated and their land is still being violated by usurpers. There are islands of silence in those vast spaces which leave a more terrible impression on the mind than screams of the dying. In those profound silences, the Myan Popol Vuh is no longer a genesis myth, but a pro- phecy, for it began like this: This is the story of how everything was in suspense, everything becalmed, wrapped in silence, everything immobile, silent and empty in the vastness of the sky [Paz, 1972b]. As one penetrates into those brooding spaces, one feels the pain and suffering of the dead Amerindian hosts, and at that moment once begins to realize that the real dead are the sowers of death, not its victims; at that moment one understands the unwritten histories of the victims intuitively and enters into the heart of their suffering. One feels their anguish in the same way that an amputee feels a persistent ache in the limb he has lost; and at that moment one also becomes the inheritor of the</page><page sequence="8">[460] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 dauntless courage and the humanity of the victims, and at that moment suffering is no longer suffering and death is no longer death. Perhaps it is at that moment too that one sees the begin- ning of the end of exile. But before one deals with the cure one must diagnose the ailment. The history of our exile is a dismal one of ethnocide, slavery, indentured labor, racism, colonialism, and more recently neocolonialism. Everywhere that we touch the earth in this hemisphere and seek to establish roots, the roots are bound to invade the graves of the innocent dead. For, after the Indian was sent on his journey to oblivion, the colonizer established new colonies of the dead-slaves from Africa, indentured. labor from India, China, Java, Madiera, and once again Africa, and along with these the per- manent human flotsam in Capitalism's Kingdom of Chance, the unemployed, the hungry, the sick who belong to no special race, color or creed, they are numbers in statistical tables, raw materi- al for academics to pontificate upon. To define this situation today in simplistic cliches about black, brown or white power is to induce a kind of intellectual euphoria in which the mind becomes anesthetized with half-truths. One has to excavate the answers from the abyss of one's self and one's mutilated society. When the colonizer exterminated the indigenous in- habitants in many regions of the Americas, they severed connections with a vast network of secret tributaries that led into the mainstream of the memory of mankind. The total reservoir of memory was seriously impoverished by this loss. The colonizer, reaching into the cultural reserves he believed he had brought with him, discovered that these were soon exhausted, leaving him with psychic voids that could not be filled. The cultural baggage he had dumped in the Middle Passage could not be salvaged. In any event, it was mostly the culturally deprived who immigrated to the Americas, so that from the start they had set out with depleted stocks. Of all the major groups that came to the Americas during the initial three hundred years of the Columbian era, the African</page><page sequence="9">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [461] alone understood the profound need to create a fusion of his culture with that of his Indian host. The African brought with him, regardless of the mosaic of cultural groups from which he derived, a built-in ethic which bound him first, as a stranger in a strange land, to study and respect the host culture before he established elements of his own. This gave the children of the African diaspora a means of surviving anywhere in the human world and they did not need guns and superior weapons in order to do this. When the African arrived in the New World, he knew that the colonizer who had brought him there was a usurper who had seized the land of the Indians, desecrated the graves and the alters of their ancestors, and sent countless of the ones who had welcomed them to the Forest of the Long Night. It was clear to the slave from Africa, that in order to escape the terrible retribution that was certain to overtake their masters, they had to make peace with both the living and the dead in this new land.... The African had to recreate his vision of himself in the universe often being violently uprooted . . . to have seen himself only through his master's eyes and to have even appeared to be an accomplice in his obnoxious deeds, would have left him with a permanent heritage of self-hatred, distorted self-images and guilt. In order to reconstruct his ontological system, the African was compelled by the logic of his own cultural past, to establish relations with his Indian host independent of the white man [Carew, 1974]. It was fortunate for us all in this hemisphere that the African began once more to make his appearance in the New World from around 1502. It was also a matter of profound cultural significance that Africans had come to the Americas in pre- Columbian times. But within two decades of his arrival in the Columbian era, there were rebellions in Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica, and Mexico, in which Africans and Indians joined forces against a common enemy. Herrera tells us that the Wolofs of San Juan de Puerto Rico "walked rebelliously through the land" (Wiener, 1920a: 158), and that no sooner had they set foot in the Indies than</page><page sequence="10">[462] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 they "began to disaffect the Indians" (Wiener, 1920b: 158). The Wolofs could, thereafter, only move from one island to another with special permission from the Viceroy. The humane and civilized African example of cultural accommodation, which runs counter to the bigotry of the white settler mentality, has largely been ignored by both our historians and the colonizers. And yet in dealing with questions of cultural roots, alienation, and identity in the Americas, it is an example that cannot be overlooked. At a time when independence, that is, an anthem, a flag, and a color on the map, brings into sharper focus, questions of national identity and liberation, the Caribbean writer is faced with harsh choices. The end of his marginal status is now in sight. As an honorary member of the marginal class he has both consciously and unconsciously internalized the mounting chaos that is pushing this class inexorably, not into revolution but revolutionary situations. Their ranks have been swelled by unemployed graduates from high schools and universities, by preachers of cults and fads, by crooks, pushers, choke-and- rob practitioners, political louts and bouncers, by instant prophets and trans-Atlantic Gurus; their dress, their speech, their music, the mumbo-jumbo they invent and discard seasonally are all imaginative forms of protest; they are often unsure of what they are for, but are absolutely certain of what they're against: the corrupt, bullying, pompous, dis- honest, cruel, incompetent, and often mindless regimes under which they live. Elements from the marginal class have taken to the streets again and again during the past decade. Their most dramatic street scenes were acted out in Trinidad in 1969. "The revolu- tion has started!" some of the more naive had cried out. But these street demonstrations could best be described by two lines from a Robert Burns poem-for they were "like the Borealis race, that flits e'er you can point its place." Yet, one should not dismiss the street demonstrations of the marginals lightly. In every instance they attracted elements</page><page sequence="11">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [463] from the working class and a minority of the intelligensia. These elements went back to bear the brunt of the repression that followed, to become more politicized, and to move the struggle to a higher level. The Caribbean writer, during this period, played the role of the middleman in the Akan Classical theatre to such perfection that scholars researching African survivals would have been delighted. Some went into hiding, others wore the gaudy costumes and transformed the slogans into academic canons. If occasionally their denounciations of white imperialism sounded too emotional, they ended by declaring that Marx was irrelevant, long live Fanon. Others played a cunning counterrevolu- tionary role. The honorary marginal is a supreme mimic and in addition to this quality can perform a literary ventriloquism. He can imitate his colonial master so perfectly that the master hears himself speaking through the servant. This servant has a phonal apparatus inside his head that those who behold it marvel at its sensitivity. The colonial intellectual passes through three stages-at the first stage he is an imitator, devoted to the idea of showing the colonizer that he has learnt all his cultural catechisms well and is ready to be accepted as an honorary white man. He is a creature who lives as though he were constantly under the scrutiny of a disapproving colonizer's eye. He is even careful about the way in which he talks in his sleep. At the second stage, our colonial has grown bold enough to be disgruntled. He has grown cunning enough to understand that Uncle Tomming from the heart is no longer in fashion, he, therefore, assumes postures of protest. The language that he has come to know better than the colonizer himself is used like a stick to beat the man, but the beating is handed out guardedly. The intention is more to make noise than to inflict pain. It is, in essence, a protest inspired by petulance, a signal to the colonizer, a plea for recognition, a cry from the emptiness of the creole soul which says: accept me as an honorary white</page><page sequence="12">[464] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 man and I will commit new and unspeakable treacheries against my own. The third stage is one of unequivocal adherence to the cause of liberation, one that challenges the Caribbean writer to take sides with the sufferers and not their exploiters, local and expatriate, with the have-nots, not the have-gots. Once the writer has made the choice he is on the road to the end of exile, the road to hope, the Freedom road, the road to the new day where: with morning bursting like pale lightnings from our eyes together side by side we'll burst asunder pale ramparts of Heaven with bare hands and bare feet to pluck wild orchids of ultimate release [Carew, 1956]. The Caribbean writer is a person from the sun. "Sun's in my blood today" (1952), Seymour writes in his very fine poem, unconsciously entering into regions of African myth which tells of how Nyankopon, the Sky-God, shoots a particle of the sun's fire into the bloodstream of the child, thus bringing the blood to life. In the Caribbean world-view the sun is a dialectical entity: it is creative and destructive, it gives life and takes it away. Anancy, the West African folk archetype in whose name all fables were told, is shaped like a gadwal, a sun-wheel, a mathematically perfect calendar. Anancy was also the victim of an encounter with the Wax Girl. The story goes that Anancy lost his perfect shape after this encounter. Among the Hausas the rainbow was called the spider's bow. This shows how close Anancy was to the divinities from heaven. And his bow, which had the shape of a snake, was called the god of rains and storms.</page><page sequence="13">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [465] In the Caribbean, Anancy lost his contacts with divinities and is known exclusively as a trickster. The European, settling in the tropical world in the Colum- bian era brought Medieval fantasies with him, of the equatorial region being a land of fire, and when this turned out to be untrue, he invented the myth that only dark-skinned peoples could do strenuous manual labor in the sun. White workers in Cuba, and those thousands of miles away in tropical Australia, and white peasants in the Caribbean have proved this to be the fiction that it is, but the myth persists; and the myth is now embraced not only by its originators but also by its victims. The creoles will still declare unblushingly that their constitutions are too delicate for them to attempt strenuous manual labor in the sun; that only blacks or coolies are fit for that kind of thing. Exile from the sun, therefore, begins in the creole mind. It is the result of a plot hatched by parents who are mesmerized by colonial fantasies of class and color escape. These parents begin telling children as soon as the amniotic fluid is washed from their eyes that the only hope for them is to go abroad, away from the sun. The sun must, in this sick creole imagination, always be kept at a distance. The sun darkens the complexion and threatens to hurl the creole back into the ranks of the blacks and coolies which he had only recently abandoned. The title of Sam Selvon's novel A Brighter Sun (1954) suggests an unconscious desire to move closer to his peasant origins, not to the distant lands of pale sunlight, but to the regions where it is brightest. Going away from the tropics, one loses one's place in the sun. What follows is a psychic unbalance from which one seldom recovers. But creating distances between oneself and the tropical sun was not only a question of removing one's physical presence from an equatorial to a temperate region, the colonized could also do it as part of a conditioned-psychological reflex. The colonial person, rooted in the parasitical economic relation-</page><page sequence="14">[466] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 ships and the schizoid cultural ones he had had with the mother country, could in his imagination be at home and overseas, in the furnace heat of his brighter sun and in pale winter sunshine, at the same time. The arch colonial still locks himself up in warm, heavy clothing in the equatorial sun and will swear that he feels no discomfort; on certain ceremonial occasions, the neocolonial ladies and gentlemen even wear gloves. But the creole, from the beginning of his emergence as a middleman in the Columbian era (the word creole originally meant "bred in the house" so that the creole stood between the field slave and the master), has been forever trying to sever his connections with the dark hinterlands under the sun. His journeys have been outward bound ones, toward the "superior" culture of the colonizer and away from the "inferior" one of the colonized. The very communication networks that vein neocolonial territories are like tracings from the creole mind and the psyche of the colonized-all roads lead outwards toward overseas cultural and spiritual meccas. The situation, though, remains a dialectical one at its core. There have always been important, living cultural and spiritual bases outside the ethos of the creole's facile borrowings and spurious imitations. Both urban and rural groups, who were rejected by the colonizer and the creole alike, incorporated rich and enduring cultural survivals into the fabric of their daily life, transforming them and keeping them alive at the same time. The Caribbean writer and artist, if he must end his exile, is compelled by the exigencies of history to move back and forth from the heart of those cultural survivals and others into whatever regions of the twentieth century the island, the continent or the cosmos his imagination encompasses; and, in roaming across the ages of man in this bloodstained hemisphere, he must penetrate into the unfathomable silences where a part of the Amerindian past is entombed, he must gnaw at the bones of universal griefs, and the reservoir</page><page sequence="15">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [467] of compassion in his heart for the dispossessed must be limitless. An Acewayo droger once told me of the journeys he took in and out of the regions of his mind. The band across his fore- head and the harness strapped under his armpits distributed the hundred and twenty-five pounds he carried in his warshi so that by thrusting his head forward he could walk at a steady, rhythmic shuffle from day clean to sunset. We were averaging twenty-five miles a day in the mountainous Potaro district. "How do you manage?" I asked, thinking of the thirty pounds I was carrying and the way it seemed to double itself after every ten miles. After a long pause he replied, "It's like this, skipper, most of the time you see me walking here, carry- ing this big load, I'm not here at all . . . is only a shadow here, the substance is back home in Aquero, hunting agouti or deer or labba, playing with my children, catching a gaff, listening to the Old Ones speak, talking to the Ancestors or to God. You can ask me then how come I can be two places at the same time, I will tell you the secret: the pressure of this wareshi on my brain makes it easy for me to send my mind away.... At the start I feel like a drunken man, there's a singing inside my head, my body feels heavy and the wareshi feels like a mountain on my back. Then all of a sudden everything gets lighter and lighter until I feel like a silk-cotton blossom floating on wind. Once I reach this stage, I can walk from here to the Forest of the Long Night without feeling any weariness." The Acewayo droger had remained for most of his life out- side the awful grinding inevitability of linear time that the Columbian era had imposed upon his people. The Amerindian induction into the remorseless cycles of time on the Euro- pean calendar had been traumatic. In 1493, Columbus ordered that every able-bodied Amerindian in Marien, one of the five Kingdoms of Hispaniola, should,within a specified time, pay the Spanish Crown a tribute of a hawk's bell full of gold. Those who failed were enslaved, mutilated or put to death. This was</page><page sequence="16">[468] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 also the Amerindian's introduction to a cruel system in which forced labor of the colonized would produce wealth for the colonizer. Labor and the colonizer's time clock became the totems heralding a new age for the Amerindian and the African. For both of these peoples, time had been something one felt like a pulse or a heartbeat. Time for them was finite. In their cosmologies, past time went back as far as the genesis of their races; it was a link between the living and their ancestors; present time merely spanned the seasons of each day, while future time covered the shortest span of all, it was restricted to the inevitable future and little else. This was how it had always been with the black and brown Men of Corn- one could live in the midst of infinities of stasis, of no time- and when one chose, one could then generate new time. In order to turn the Men of Corn into Natives of Capitalism the colonizer committed unspeakable atrocities of ethnocide and the enslavement of millions. He then attempted to remove all traces of his crime. He did it with the same cunning the authorities had used after the massacre of workers in the public square in Marquez's novel A Hundred Years of Solitude (1970). In the ghoulish silence and the emptiness that came in the wake of the massacre, even the stones could not speak after they were washed clean of the bloodstains. Having shattered forever the Afro-Amerindian concepts of time, the colonizer created a new time which he chained in- exorably to his own future expectations, and time became money. In order to illuminate the dialectic of pre-Columbian time and time in the Columbian era, a few Caribbean writers had to unlock secrets of lost centuries. They used rivers as the symbol of their journeys into the past. In Black Midas, Aron Smart had said about his grand- parents that, "they felt time like a river in their blood" (Carew, 1958a: 10). An early Wilson Harris poem had described the journey of one of his mythical characters:</page><page sequence="17">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [469] Down Rivers of his Night Where he must drown to banish fear (1952). This orphic journey was reenacted later in the search for the Palace of the Peacock (Harris, 1960). In Alejo Carpentier's The Lost Steps (1956), the hero travels into primordial hinterlands up one of the great rivers of South America, traversing milleniums in his orphic journey. Car- pentier went far afield from his island home to find a setting for his hero's wanderings. He needed a continent. Edouard Glissant chose a river in Martinque as the symbol of his search for roots and a genuine identity in this novel La Lezarde (1959). What was interesting about the droger's psychological escape route is that it led inwards. It never occurred to him to move beyond the frontiers of home and the forest. Glissant's river, "la lezarde," however, takes us inland to its source and from the secret spring where it rises to the sea. For on an island your cosmos of the imagination begins with the sea. In the search for an identity, one of the maj or themes in Carib- bean writing, the impulse is either to move inwards toward some undiscovered heartland as in Carpentier's The Lost Steps (1956), Glissant's La Lezarde (1959), Reid Newday (1970), Asturias's Hombres de Maiz (1957), Harris's Palace of the Peacock (1960), my own Black Midas (1958): or outwards toward the meccas of the colonizer as in Lamming's The Emegrants (1955), Natives of My Person (1972), Clarke's Survivors of the Crossing (1965), The Meeting Point (1967). These novels are works I have chosen from what has now become an impressive array. They are, therefore, by no means the only ones that illustrate the dichotomy of the inward and the outward vision in Caribbean writing. Salkey's Come Home Malcolm Heartland (1976) is a novel about a Caribbean exile preparing to return home. Having explored the outward vision to its utmost limits, the hero is escaping the wide indifference of decades abroad to return to a spiritual Sleepy Hollow.</page><page sequence="18">[470] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 The hero of Carpentier's The Lost Steps (1956) is a Euro- American musicologist and composer. In his search for an identity he first goes to Europe but does not find the illusory Europe that his father had brought him up to revere. His dis- illusionment is complete when he realizes that a psychic up- rootment had taken place when his ancestors abandoned the Old country. But in America as a white settler he also had to seek out and find the inner sanctuaries of a spiritual heartland that racist fantasies, a strident and spurious nationalism, and a spate of colonizer's myths had unconsciously prevented him from exploring. But he was also an artist surrounded by dilettantes and colonial cultists of art with a capital A. After a chance encounter with the curator of a museum, he sets out from New York on an expedition to find the first musical instruments that man created in the Americas. He is delayed for a while in a South American city where, from the relative safety of a tourist hotel he watched a palace revolt flare up only to be extinguished. Hisjourney continues over mountains as close to heaven as a man can hope to be without leaving the earth. A steep descent brings him to tropical lowlands, the main setting of his search for an American and a human identity. In a few weeks he journeys to the upper reaches of the great river, and, in the milleniums he traverses during this small span of time, hisjourney becomes one of self-discovery- the discovery of a new American self which was hidden in primodial rainforest fastnesses; the roots of the Amerindian psyche and the Amerindian person; the inner spiritual sanctum of the Men of Corn; the point from which they began their migrations outwards. In this remote world where linear time as he knew it had become meaningless, the hero is, he believes at first, reborn. But this was a romantic illusion. He goes back to the world of the twentieth century, his spirit refurbished, the scales scraped away from his eyes; when he tries to return to the Eden he thought he had rediscovered, the steps are lost. Yet, he had gathered unto himself an immense creative power in that trespass into prehistory and back. He returned to the</page><page sequence="19">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [471] sisyphian tasks of the artist, chastened and reformed, knowing that he had to cross not only past centuries but to venture into future ones. In Glissant's La Lezarde (1959) the search for an identity follows the course of a river to its source, and the spring from which it rises is enclosed by an old colonial stone house. The river takes us into the heartland of a country. Glissant, introduces us to a journey of discovery with a poem: "What is this country?" he asked And the answer was: "First weigh every word, make the acquaintance of every sorrow." [1959a]. The author's Lezarde is really a river of life which runs through both a physical and spiritual landscape. As the river makes its way to the sea, one can feel the people stirring, the land awakening, and the people, the land, the river, the sky coming together in a miraculous unity. And during the long season of a people's consciousness ripening, the author poses a question that goes to the heart of the dream to end the feeling of homelessness at home. "Can we," he asks, "give a name to any parcel of earth before the man and woman who inhabits it has arisen?" (Glissant, 1959b: 18). La Lezarde (1 959) illuminates the psychological landscape it traverses like flashes of lightning. Its symbols are revealed to us like the vast array of different species of flora and fauna secreted away in a rain forest. The river brings clarity to the apparent chaos; it is linked to geological time; it existed before man did; it flows into an expectation of countless seasons. It is like Alegria's The Golden Serpent (1947), a Peruvian river that threads its way through the life of 4 people and one that becomes a timeless symbol of a people's fight for freedom. The river is a perfect symbol of man's seminal connection with life and being. The interior landscapes of Harris's novels are veined with dreaming rivers of life, death and seasons of eternity.</page><page sequence="20">[472] JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 Pia and Makunaima, the Children of the Sun, are the oldest and most universal culture heroes in this hemisphere. From Patagonia to the edge of the Canadian Barens, the same story was told by the Amerindians from time immemorial. It is the story of how these twins were born and how their two greatest feats were to bring fire to man and to tame the rivers by placing gigantic rocks and boulders across them. An Amerindian poem sings about: The white sun raping dark rivers the white sun biting like a Vaquero's ship the white sun singing, singing singing the songs of the dead the white sun a burning requiem but the cool night must come [Carew, 1952]. In this song-poem the seminal anthropomorphic symbols- the sun, the dark interior river, the songs of the dead, the night-are united. The river rises in hinterlands of silence and flows to the clamorous sea and on the way its tributaries reach into the flesh of the land like so many capillaries. The river can be the symbol of the exile journeying outwards or the exile coming home. "All men return to the hills finally" (1949), the Roger Mais poem had declared. His hills, both real and symbolical, were an oasis where the writer and artist went to gather strength, to heal the wounds inflicted by the philistines at home and racists abroad. From the hills one moves outwards, toward the sea. Both the consciousness of the sea and the absence of this consciousness is an interesting psychological phenomenon in the Caribbean. The dream that emerges in Caribbean writing is one of crossing the sea or of contemplating its moods, never of conquering it. The Caribs and the Europeans were con- querors of the sea, creators of sagas; their imaginations were</page><page sequence="21">Carew / CARIBBEAN WRITER [473] forever encompassing new horizons of turbulent water. But for the new Caribbean man the sea was a capricious and often dan- gerous moat between stepping stones of islands and continents. The sea which Lamming describes in great detail in Natives of My Person (1972), is perceived as though from a great distance; it is something, not only separating continents and islands, but suspended between them. It is a weightless, static sea, like the one described in the Mayan genesis myth, the Popol Vuh rather than a heaving, turbulent reality. In an earlier novel, Lamming's emigrants cross the Atlantic and are barely aware of this ocean's existence. But in their conversations it is clear that they're carrying enduring memories of the smell of their earth and the dreams of their people with them. The journey by sea is an interlude between home and the Caribbean communities islanded abroad. Clarke's Survivors of the Crossing (1965) also erase the reality of the ocean they crossed from their minds. In The Meeting Point (Clarke, 1967) the emigrants have moved to air travel and are more at ease. Perhaps, we all carry deep in our unconscious minds the traumatic memory of the ancestral crossing in the Columbian and slave era. In Salkey's Come Home Macolm Heartland (1976) the Caribbean Janus astride two worlds is about to abandon one of the two and return home regardless of the philistines, the areas of mindlessness that he must invade and conquer, the malice waiting to ambush him, and the deep awareness that a part of him had died during the decades abroad in the emptiness, the racial scorn, the endless encounters with real and imagined acts of discrimina- tion he had had to endure. Malcolm Heartland also knows that the home to which he is returning is innocent of many social and political resonances for which he had developed an inner ear. Heartland dies both a real and symbolical death before he takes the plunge. But there are Heartlands at home who survived both crossings, the one to the meccas of the colonizer and the other home to the secret heartlands where the waters of the River of Life began their flow. Perhaps</page><page sequence="22">[4741 JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES / JUNE 1978 the finest evocation of this return home to slowly awakening Sleepy Hollows perched on top of a people's volcanic dis- contents can be found in Mervyn Morris's poetry. This poetry is uncompromisingly honest. Sensitive, it penetrates the heart of the discontents that centuries of exile and cultural aliena- tion gave birth to. "All people have a right to share the waters of the River of Life and to drink with their own cups, but our cups have been broken," laments the Carib poem-hymn. The writer, artist, musician, is directly involved in the creative process of reshaping the broken cups. But as an Asian writer had said from a Republic perched on the Roof of the World in the Soviet Far East, "Art and Literature are like lightning, and lightning can never be timid." Therefore, while we shape exquisite new cups, we must, side by side with the disinherited millions of the Third World, confront those who would deny us our fair share of the Waters of the River of Life, for it was at the source of those waters that the exile of the Caribbean writer began, and it is there that his exile will end.
