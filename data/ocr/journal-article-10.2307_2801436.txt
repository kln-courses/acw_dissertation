<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROJECTING PERSONHOOD IN MELANESIA: THE DIALECTICS OF ARTEFACT SYMBOLISM ON SABARL ISLAND DEBBORA BATTAGLIA University of California at Los Angeles Among the Sabarl of Papua New Guinea, fundamental concepts of person are visually encoded in valuables which are used as ceremonial currency throughout the Massim area. These objects are further employed as symbolic substitutes for persons in mortuary rituals and exchanges: the 'performed memorials' to Sabarl personhood which culminate lifetimes of reciprocal nurture, and choreograph social survival. Memorial events thus incorporate memorial objects which, beyond merely representing persons and in opposition to any image of transcendental stillness, reinforce dialectical principles viewed by the Sabarl as requisites of personal and social vitality. In I93 5 Malinowski (I93 5: Io) remarked that the Trobriander would agree with Stendhal's definition of beauty as the promise of bliss, rather than with Katit's emasculated statement about disinterested contemplation as the essence of aesthetic enjoyment. The pragmatic nature of Trobriand aesthetics, with its roots in things which promise. . . safety, prosperity, abundance and sensual pleasure (I93 5: IO), was a keen interest of Malinowski's and surfaced in all his major works. Yet the subject was never probed systematically. Indeed, apart from Leach (I954) it is only recently that models have emerged for exploring the symbolism as well as the sociological foundations of Massim expressive forms, notably in Munn's work on Gawa (I982), with contributions from Weiner (I976) and Tambiah (I968; I982) on the Trobriands, Campbell (I982) on Vakuta and Scoditti (I98I; I982) on Kitawa. These rationalistic analyses have drawn on a bank of ethnographic detail for northern Massim groups. But for the southern Massim, adjacent to the so-called 'Kula' ring, published material is thin and there is nothing whatsoever on aesthetic processes. The two areas share some of the same types of ceremonial objects, are cognate with regard to visual symbolism and are similarly Massim in terms of style. Yet the models spawned in the northern Kula areas are not directly applicable to the southern Massim scenario. First the ethnographic profiles of the two areas are quite different, despite the common matrilineal bias to their social organisations. In the south, the creative focus of social life is the mortuary complex: a series of feasts and rituals held in honour of individuals. These motivate, as the Kula does in the north, public relations between persons and clans in different villages and on neighbouring islands. As in the Trobriands, women are often key figures in exchange transactions and mortuary rituals, although in the south they use the same types of valuables as men (in addition to specialised women's 'bulk wealth'). Yet perhaps the most dramatic difference is the place of the paternal matriclan at the base of the structure of political and religious activities. In the light of this, we would expect that the coding of cultural values might Ma,, (N.S.) I8, 289-304.</page><page sequence="2">290 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA differ in the southern region, and that critical differences might be encoded in ceremonial objects; that, furthermore, in view of the importance of mortuary activities in the south, fundamental themes of personhood and social and individual survival might be salient in object symbolism. The point is discussed through ethnographic material from a study of mortuary practices and beliefs among the Sabarl Islanders of Papua New Guinea.1 Their words and phrases, or glosses of them, appear in quotes throughout the text. In a myth that the Sabarl regard as irrefutable, a huge buzzard challenges a giant snake to a deadly battle of strength. When the snake is finally tricked into leaving its hole, the buzzard snatches it up and flies with it round the ocean until it dies and decomposes. The rotting flesh falls into the sea and forms the islands of the archipelago. Then the skeleton is tossed away, becoming Sabarl: the 'bones' of the serpent. Sabarl is a truly skeletal coral atoll, with virtually no garden land, few coconuts and no fresh water. Tight clusters of family dwellings line the beachfronts of a hamlet and two villages, facing garden islands across a stretch of open sea. The nuclear household is the basic unit of Sabarl's subsistence economy. The model of residence is patrivirilocal, with village land descending by right through the male owner's matriclan after his death (for example, to his sister's son). Not uncommonly his widow intervenes, exercising her own option to hold land in trust while her children arrange to pay off their paternal cousins, aunts or uncles. Garden land is owned by both men and women, and descends through their children in roughly the same way. This land is less hotly contested than residential space in cramped cove villages. House sites are viewed as memorials to the men of the matrilineage, incorporating their graves (and ideally those of their wives); their tutelage descends with the property. This said, it is clear that alongside the organisational principle of clanship, there exists the countervailing fact of personal choice in the area of paternal property transmission. There is also a structural bias in favour of paternal kin acquiring portable wealth items given in exchange for land rights, and after a death as payment for lifelong gestures of affinal nurture. Thus the inheritance of property turns on the fragile linkages of cross-clan relations, with particular stress on cross-cousin heirs to uphold the interests of their opposing clans. These interests are confirmed at mortuary feasts, expressed in the ritual idioms of maternal and paternal, group and individual interdependence. The place of women in this schema is a strong one. Women commonly act as representatives of their paternal or maternal clans in political matters. Indeed, 'true women' (vanakau suwot) will even sail in search of wealth items and the luxuries needed for exchange feasts sponsored in their names. They obtain the customary pigs and ceremonial objects as men do from off-island trading partners (traditionally paternal relations) scattered throughout the archipelago. Trade 'pathways' (hiyela) created by these partnerships fade and re-emerge over time. The process is likened to stringing shell beads in pairs 'island style', to make a strong double strand. But still the thread breaks and trade relations are</page><page sequence="3">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 29I lost or must be reassessed, reworked or replaced. In life, the danger of this happening is greatest when one of the partners dies. Renewing vital pathways, often through siblings or a widowed spouse or children, is a key objective of commemorative events. Mortuary exchange feasts, called segaiya, draw together kin and trading partners from throughout the Saisai islands and often beyond. Red shell necklaces or bak and 'greenstone' axe blades or tobwatobwa2 are the primary ceremonial currency of the area and, together with pigs, the material focus of aggressive social net-mending on these occasions. They are also, and just as importantly, powerful honorific symbols, viewed as memorials to personhood and treated as icons of social order. Indeed, their basic forms and carved detail are actually described as looking 'like people', in accordance with which the shadows they cast are linguistically classified as 'animate'. The present article explores the dynamics of this animate status for the ceremonial axe in particular, and through it key notions of person and gender as manifested in tobwatobwa symbolism. In approaching the general subject of personhood, I shall be examining what Mauss has called the 'personage' (I968) and Dumont the 'particular man'-i. e. the 'empirical subject of speech, thought and will, indivisible sample of mankind' (I977:8)-versus the individual as an 'independent, autonomous and thus (essentially) non-social moral being'. Related to each other dialectically (rather than in an evolutionary sense), these concepts together represent 'personhood' on Sabarl. Thus the emphasis here is on sociological personhood and culturally expressed parameters of behaviour (see Geertz I966; Poole I982). This includes, for example, commonly- held notions of individuality and corporeality, as opposed to emphasising personal experience and the intricate subject of selfhood. Externally defined concepts of person and internally motivated expressions of individuality be- come truly useful to anthropologists only when analytically treated as inter- dependent (Tuzin I977). We begin with a scene from the mortuary feast that is felt to be the 'most important' in the series. It is usually referred to simply as Segaiya (its proper name is Moni or Sago Pudding) and is held in the dead person's village. To open the events, his paternal clan publicly presents five ceremonial axes to his maternal clan heirs - parading them through the village to the house where he lived and where his corpse once 'slept' before the burial. The ceremony is brief, the paternal clan departs. Then, in absolute secrecy, the axes are used to construct in effigy the 'corpse' of the honoured dead. The work of constructing the artificial corpse falls to a ritual adept of the maternal clan. He begins by preparing the house interior, making it 'hot' and sacred with magical spells and sprays of masticated substances. Next he assembles the 'corpse' by propping the handles against one another so that the axes rest on their blades and points, resembling sevens with their angles in the air. They are said to represent a human body 'reclining' in its grave. This is more understandable if we view the axes as a corpse fused with the shape of a</page><page sequence="4">292 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA traditional L-shaped (vertical shaft) grave. The effect is quite dramatic, namely of a person raised as it were from the grave and re-installed at the centre of his reproductive life. This marks the beginning of his life as an ancestor or tubu, and establishes him or her as a source of economic and spiritual aid for the living. The ancestral corpse of blades is draped with red shell necklaces or bak. Then other valuables are placed around it, the whole assemblage hidden by a screen of mats (as couples hide themselves for intercourse) and-in an atmosphere tense with concentration-the 'corpse' is magically urged to reproduce more axe blades. What is it, then, that makes these objects appropriate substitutes for persons? The answer lies in establishing their ontological foundations and looking as it were to the source-to Sabarl concepts of the person and beliefs about the construction, maintenance, destruction and afterlife of individuals. The Sabarl 'person' (tonuwopik-literally 'one with mind/memory')3 is said to be conceived from 'white blood' or 'father's blood' (pusi) and 'red blood' or 'mother's blood' (maliba) in the heat of sexual intercourse. The bloods form the red and white parts of the body. The first parts to take human shape are the skull and skeleton, glossed as 'bones' (titiwa). The bones 'support' (labe) the red flesh and organs that are affixed to the skeletal core and grow around it. White 'fat' or 'grease' (tabwa) is added during post-conception coitus, 'complementing' (gaba) the flesh and bones and completing the foetal form. Only the brain is of uncertain origin, mainly because it is viewed as something totally original; the locus of 'mind' (nuwo) and free will. Thus the terminals of the corporeal person are paternal substance reconstituted. Moreover this substance represents as bones and fat the archetypally 'lean' (keve) and 'greasy' (posa), 'cool' (tuitui) and 'hot' (ngongon) components of the physical person. The maternal flesh, which is warm and receptive to grease but basically lean, falls literally and categorically in between. Throughout life, maintaining good health will be viewed as a process of keeping these elements in balance. The consumption of cool and hot foods (and also liquids) classified as lean or greasy 'food complements' (enagaba) of one another will be regulated by notions of internal body balance, at least to some degree. And underpinning the human growth and health schema are the principles of support and complementarity (fig. i). Let us consider these concepts more closely. First, labe or 'supports' are just that: items that set one another up, one item structuring or positioning an analogous one without essentially changing it. Supports are equally valued in this function. The arm of a ceremonial axe is a valued support for the blade; one bundle of sago supports another as they hang in balance 'like a husband and wife' over a storage pole; at exchange feasts, pigs provided by affines support the yams from the matriclan. In other words, labe works as a concept to obviate or in local terms 'cover up' (yabo) contradictions, by stressing instead a common function or ob jective. Gaba or 'complementary' relationships are also viewed and talked about as supportive. However, they stress what Levi-Strauss would call the oppositional aspect of paired elements and the process of completing, or bringing to potential, one of the pair through the other. Thus fat complements the bones</page><page sequence="5">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 293 and flesh of the foetus, completing the physical person. A man is said to complement a woman through marriage. Greasy sago pudding is the best complement of dry sago cake. And as we shall see, the axe blade and haft symbolically complement one another. This exploitation of 'contradictions' (Wagner 1975:52) sets up dynamic tensions which 'cover up' or obviate their static relationship as supports. So that paired complementary items are neither in balance nor ever unequal in any fixed sense. The relation of labe to gaba turns on this dynamic tension. It is like, to use Wagner's words, the relationship of cultural convention to cultural invention: 'invention changes things, and convention resolves those changes into a recog- nizable world' (1975:53). Thus these concepts are related dialectically, although 4 only gaba relationships are dialectical in themselves We have been discussing the basics of the corporeal body (or tuwa). However, there is one additional substance that 'lives inside the body and makes it breathe'. This is hinona, the 'content' of life, a kind of material life-force. Hinona is conceived as something like energy in store: a discrete substance, separate from the body yet coursing invisibly through it. It is likened to hidden nutrients: a 'fish in the hole', a 'yam in the earth', 'coconut flesh' are all 'like hinona'. When someone is sorcerised or in the local idiom 'eaten', his hinona is eaten away. Hinona is also the term for genitalia. Thus in its broadest sense it signifies reproductive energy, substances and loci essential to personal survival. As a concept, it also underlies the support/complement dialectic, driving or generat- ing the process of obviation. And as we shall see it is hinona that links persons and ceremonial axes conceptually. In addition to his physical parts, a person possesses a 'spirit' or 'soul' (yalowane) and a shadow of reflection (kakaunununa) regarded as the 'image' of his spirit. A person can learn to direct his spirit and image and to send them in and out of his body. Depending on the magical spell, he becomes in this spirit-form either a benign journeyer (hebakunyolyol) or a deadly 'sending' with the power to cause mortal illness (a waunak). By specialising further he can learn SUPPORT ......

Foetal development.</page><page sequence="6">294 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA to materialise his body wherever his spirit goes. A male with this skill becomes a bibiloia, an arch-sorcerer who manifests himself in monstrous human forms. His female counterpart is yoyova, a woman who flies with a pack of other women as a meteorite or shooting star (the Sabarl counterpart of a Trobriand flying witch). Both bibiloia and yoyova are believed to be scorchingly hot. At his death, a sorcerer or sorceress is said to be annihilated, body and spirit. Peaceable people, on the other hand, are recycled; their physical parts (body and life-essence) symbolically returned to the world in useful material forms. The spiritual parts normally take another path-the spirit crossing over to the afterworld and shedding its old image for the eternal form of a baloma or 'spirit-person'. The baloma are undifferentiated spirits of the matriclan-the counterparts of specific named ancestors or tubu who reside in various mem- orials in the world of the living. Sabarl say that the androgynous Creator Enak (or God) gave birth to the first mortal ancestor; that at this point everything 'came to its place', birth and death bringing order to the world. At the same time Enak created the tools of human survival. Their images remain as memorials to reproduction5: axes, canoes, pots, even Enak's genitalia, visible in red and white stone on island cliffsides throughout the archipelago. To the Sabarl, they constitute sacred proof of the creation story. They are regarded as Enak's personal 'memorials', nimana muina, literally 'the mark of his/her hand', and if such images were damaged the islands would sink beneath the sea. All indigenous artefacts recall this original re- lationship to personhood-are the durable counterparts of 'evidence' (muina) of it. The mark-making 'arm' of the tobwatobwa, with its rich layers of anthropomorphic symbolism, in many ways epitomises the bond. popokona arm \A nimana i hand nimana gamwana leg A kaununa-&lt; genitals! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~oo/nosel prowl point genitalS/ V bUSUna right hand bsn hinona CONTENT/STONE ARM/BONES BLADE nimana titiwa hinona CEREMONIAL AXE/RIGHT ARM/PHYSICAL BODY tobwatobwa nimana tuwa FIGURE 2. Tobwatobwa.</page><page sequence="7">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 295 The axe as a whole takes its name from the stone blade or tobwatobwa. The blade is the 'content' (hinona) of the axe; the object of value in economic terms. Hinona is also the term for 'genitals' and 'right hand' (an indication of the strong associative links between economic and biological reproduction). A flat wooden handle or 'arm' (nimana) displays and 'supports' (labe) the blade on secular occasions, and is in turn supported by it in certain sacred rituals as we have already seen for the 'corpse' of axes. Its shape is said to be suggestive of 'bones' (titiwa). The handle is traditionally carved from red mwadawa wood (a species of teak), associated in myth with red maternal flesh and in verbal exegesis with the 'matriclan' (hun)6. Likewise the 'head' (kaununa) of the handle is carved in the primary emblem of clanship, namely a bird's head rendered in profile. Thus as 'bones', 'flesh' and clan 'head', the wooden haft is a representation7 of the 'body' (tuwa) of the corporate person-the person as clan-member. The greenstone blade, as hinona, broadly represents the singular person and the reproductivity of the individual. As we shall see, the themes of corporation and individuality are important leitmotifs in tobwatobwa iconography. Other body parts emerge in the more specific names for parts of the handle. The long section of the handle is the 'leg' (hena), which ends at a carved 'foot' (busuna, the generic term for 'point', 'nose' and 'prow'); the shorter section is the arm', with fibre bindings at the 'hand' (nimana gamwana). Keeping in mind the importance of hinona in relation to the physical person, we can now glimpse the significance of the tobwatobwa blade to the Sabarl. For in effect the object is identified with persons through the very essence of their physical existence. This becomes clearer once we consider what hinona as a medium of biological productivity has in common with hinona as an economic force-namely, its connexion with heat: the heat of sexual intercourse that gen- erates gestation; the heat of aggressive physical labour associated with the axe as an implement and a weapon. The tobwatobwa blade embodies heat symboli- cally; is even described as being heat-generating or 'greasy' in certain contexts. Thus hinona is a link in the production of new people, new objects and new social ties (through exchange)-in short in a process of fabrication that at once individuates the person and prepares the ground for his membership in a clan-based society. We can surmise, then, that the model dynamism we perceived in Sabarl images of the developing person underlies tobwatobwa symbolism as well and forms the basis of the object's effect on people in ceremonial situations. Meanwhile, let us be more concrete. We have talked about the axe blade as 'content' and 'reproductive substance'. It is also a man-worked stone, although not viewed as such by the Sabarl. For to them the tobwatobwa is a natural object that grows 'like shells' (and also like people), outwards from the centre. The spawning grounds are believed to be shallow estuaries at the westward end of the Calvados Chain, notably pools where 'cool' fresh water (bwai) and 'hot' salt water (soga) intermingle. The heat of the soga derives from the salt, which causes swelling or fattening (like 'hot' paternal grease). It is interesting that these are also, as we have seen, the metaphoric conditions of health in persons. Event- ually, the growing blade takes a triangular shape; indeed it appears that all Massim symbolic representations of person have this in common8.</page><page sequence="8">296 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA However, the hafted axe as a whole is not perceived as a static triangular shape, but as an image of action and directed movement. I first became aware of this when a Sabarl man commented that segaiya (mortuary feasts) 'look like tobwatob- wa', and drew this shape in the sand (fig. 3a). We had been discussing his special exchange relationship with the patrilateral cross-cousin he called 'my father' or tamau and who called him 'my child' or natu (note that female cousins may play the role of 'father' in this relationship) (fig. 3b). Whenever he was ill, his cousin-'father' would give him foods to 'make him buoyant and healthy again' and sometimes axe blades 'to make him strong'. These gifts of 'bones' or titiwa would be acknowledged periodically by the 'child' with gifts of growing things to his 'father' (young sago palms, puppies and so on) called segaiya. These segaiya counter-prestations constituted a pledge to the 'father' that his/her care would reap rewards at the 'child's' mortuary feast of the same name. Indeed, they would constitute the core exchanges of that most important event. \ A )0 child natu A tamau father (nubaiu) (nubaiu) FIGURE 3a. Image of Segaiya. (cousin) (cousin) FIGURE 3b. 'Fathcr' and 'Child'. Rendered graphically, these exchanges 'look like tobwatobwa': a lateral move- ment of wealth items from the 'father's side' (the left side or 'arm' of a person) to the 'mother's side' (his right side), then back again. However, the main point my informant was stressing was that although the segaiya benefited the ritual 'father' himself directly, the objects he or she acquired were in fact an investment 'downward' in his children (fig. 4). This interpretation gives a great deal of significance to the turning-point of the action, to death and the 'child' (on the one hand) and to the 'bird's head' and 'elbow' of the haft (on the other). Let us consider these images more closely. child titizva father FIGURE 4. Vital turning points. It is said that an elbow is the part of a person's arm that 'makes it strong'. Limbs without working joints are useless, frozen and generally associated with rigor mortis. There is also a parable to the effect that when a person is drowning, his 'elbow' will save him. However, this is a more specific reference to a kin relation called 'elbow'-the mother's mother's brother's son or daughter of oneself (fig. 5). None of my informants could say why his 'elbow' should want to keep him from drowning. However, all of them knew that to</page><page sequence="9">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 297 marry his 'elbow' was incest of a type. The marriage proscription is expressed in the placement of 'elbows' within the kinship category tubu, usually reserved for persons two generations senior (or junior, although seniority is salient in exegesis). The taboo against marrying a tubu is strictly observed in this usual sense. But from the diagram below (fig. 5), it is evident that if ego's mother is a ritual 'father' (again, this is common) it would figuratively speaking be sibling incest to marry the person she calls 'my child', and from whom one stands eventually to inherit tobwatobwa and other items of wealth. grandparent ? tubu I nimana popokona1 elbow E &gt; ~EGO FIGURE 5. Ego and elbow. Returning to the theme of support, which is the special role of the MMBS/D in the parable, we can see that tobwatobwa 'elbows' represent the joint in the socially vital movement of reciprocal giving (as rendered in the tobwatobwa arm); also the point in an individual's existence where primary clan tensions articulate. This same movement is perceived as the ideal route of valuable objects away from the person, clan or village and, importantly, back again. What then is the significance of the bird at the head of the haft with regard to dynamic tensions and two-directional movement? Obviously it signifies clanship and a place for the matriclan at the armature of exchange. On this level it visually reinforces the familiar theme of support for individuals by their clan groups. But relative to the axe as a construct of person, the motif carries other meanings as well. First, it is identified by Sabarl carvers as a boi or reef heron (Egretta sacra), which in myth is a male fisher married to a woman. However, in all ceremonial handles an S-shaped mwata or 'snake' is depicted in its beak and not a fish. The mwata motifis usually carved in low relief, sometimes running along the arm or merging with the 'pigeon' (lumlum)9 motif at the point of the haft. Thus, considered as a sign-set, the bird-and-snake would seem to represent the mythical creators ofthe Saisai islands. In myth, the bird begins life as a heron but matures into a buzzard or manak, symbol of cannibalism and death. So that on the handle the symbolic replacement of his (female) diet of fish with the mythical snake invests the tobwatobwa with elements of sexual conflict-likewise embodying its productive outcome. This outcome could be figurativly seen from another angle as putting islands on the map (through exchange). To summarise relations at the turning point of the axe, we could say that the social 'support' relationship of 'elbow/child'-that is, when viewed as an expression of co-ordinated maternal and paternal giving-is transformed at the point of death into an individualistic form of conflict. The conflict is visually encoded as the bird-and-snake sign-set, conceived as a sexual opposition. This extends to interpersonal conflict over the inheritance of land (in the myth this is</page><page sequence="10">298 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA literal). It is interesting that these images of conflict are rendered explicitly in the carved detail which literally 'covers' or obviates the basic arm support. Thus the dialectic is presented in visual terms. However, to give it finer focus, we return to the scene of the mortuary feast (the Segaiya) with which this discussion opened. The feast of Segaiya is commonly described as the feast 'for the ritual father'. In it he/she is publicly repaid for his inter vivos gifts of 'bones' to the 'child' who has subsequently died. The five axes presented to the child's mother's clan consti- tute a demand for due compensation. And we can now see that on another level they graphically represent the cross-cousin titiwa-segaiya exchanges, a lifetime support relationship encapsulated (metaphorically) in the paternal 'bones' and 'grease' of handle and blade. This feast is the culminative point of that re- lationship, paradoxically signalling its collapse and the final severance of the cross-cousin bond. In this sense it is appropriate that the 'corpse' of axes should visually express the overturning of social support, and for the focus to shift to the individual. The moment the 'corpse' is magically endowed with the power to reproduce axe blades, it becomes something more than a representation of the ancestor; it becomes a concrete substitute for the 'child' as a reproductive unit of his or her society. As we have seen, this substitution or 'replacement' (lase)10 occurs at the point where conventional supports collapse in on one another, obliterating distinctions in the process of setting up new ones. In this instance, it is gender distinctions that arise. A review of the Sabarl material reveals a significant absence of gender associations in the area of labe or support idioms. Where notions of male and female are mentioned it is in connexion with dynamic gaba relations. In other words, gender differentiation becomes significant among the Sabarl at points where conventional social supports collapse-that is, at points of individual life crisis where it is important to define productive life processes against the prevailing field of counter-productive tendencies. What we find in the axe ancestor is a self-fulfilling prophecy of this objective. It is the blade, the hinona or reproductive essence, which is symbolically focal. Yet gender has not figured in our discussion of hinona, either as 'energy', 'genitals', 'right hand' or 'contents' of the tobwatobwa; nor was it mentioned in other words by the Sabarl in verbal exegesis on the subject. The picture alters somewhat when we turn to myth. Ceremonial axes feature in only one Sabarl story. It tells how a young woman is married to a tobwatobwa. Suspecting her of adultery (of which she is innocent) her axe-husband cuts her throat as she sleeps. Her grandmother finds her body and lays it in a dish of salt water where it comes to life again, then throws the murderous axe blade into the fire. There it explodes and scatters axe blades around the archipelago. Elements of the story appear in a ritual sequence that follows the construction of the 'corpse' of axes during the feast of Segaiya. The scene is a dramatisation of the false revenge of the ancestral axe on his spouse (and recognised as such by the ritual participants). Acting the innocent victim is the widowed spouse of the</page><page sequence="11">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 299 deceased. He or she is seated beside a display of food on the ground behind his house, wearing the mourning soot of the socially dead. The foods beside him are associated with him and referred to as 'corpse' foods. Suddenly the men of the matriclan spring from the house, brandishing tobwatobwa and making gestures of cutting the neck of the spouse. In the heat of the mock battle, the axe blades are scattered among the ritual foods and propped against the widowed spouse. Later the blades, the food and other items of wealth will be given to the ritual father in exchange for releasing the widowed spouse from mourning and freeing him or her to remarry. In effect, the axes that opened the segaiya on the theme of paternal support are appearing now as 'masculine' objects in relation to a 'feminine' or feminised1" spouse. The dramatic reunion of the ancestral 'corpse' of objects and the spousal 'corpse' of food is of course symbolically highly sexual. People will actually say that the 'corpse' foods are being 'complemented' by the blades; that the blades 'add grease' to the foods, making them 'stronger' and, significantly, 'more like people'. The image this suggests, which we have encountered before, is that of completing the corporeal person in utero with greasy paternal substance. Here, however, the ultimate (rather than the initial) completion of the person is at issue in conjoining female and male, maternal and paternal elements to create an ancestor, and in the simultaneous act of rejoining him to his 'other half' in social terms. That the axes in the 'corpse' of objects are masculine is clearly indicated here, which indeed as ceremonial weapons is how the blade (as hinona) and haft (as 'bones') are talked about, i.e. as 'men's things'. This is important, for example by comparison with the northern Massim, where valuables are spoken of as 'men's' or 'women's', apparently without hidden mixtures of masculine and feminine referents.

TransforImiatioInal processes. It is now possible to consider more closely the maternal element in the 'corpse' of axes, represented by the red shell necklaces (bak) draped over it.</page><page sequence="12">300 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA The bak is less obviously anthropomorphic than the tobwatobwa, it would seem, in the minds of the Sabarl themselves. Most apparent is the helmet shell 'head' (kaununa), which transforms the necklace from a married woman's ornament into a ceremonial valuable. A necklace with a head is said to acquire a voice' in the form of shell chimes. It is the head that makes the object 'more like people'. The bak, like the tobwatobwa, is viewed as an icon of two-directional movement. The strands are divided into an 'out' and 'back' side by a clasp that symbolically 'turns' (havile) the flow of the valuable shell discs 'back towards home'. This refers to the common fear that things, like people, will naturally follow the second law of thermodynamics and wander away from the village or clan forever. Much of what is not said about the bak can be inferred from myths and the iconography of the object. For example, an important section is the 'bush fowl's legs' (kulihi hehena), twin strands connecting the pendant to the necklace. In a myth of the same name, a young woman is tricked into climbing a betelnut tree which takes her to the top of the sky. Here she marries a reef heron and sets up house. Her parents miss her and sponsor a competition for the birds of the world, offering a bak to the one who brings her back home. It is a total surprise when the ponderous bush fowl succeeds. Gratefully, her parents wind a side of bak round each leg, turning it red. Several Sabarl women allowed that the story referred to the 'out' and 'back' sides of a bak. Thus the bush fowl in the story takes the role of paternal support in recycling the woman back into reproductive life, just as widows are recycled by the ritual father, and just as on another level the maternal line is recycled past a generation break through children. We could say, then, that the necklace is viewed as a circular path, broken in the centre by a clasp which is sometimes a buzzard's beak (symbolic of death), sometimes a 'canoe-shaped' gold-lip shell, but either way a symbol of bridging. Indeed, if each 'line' (labu) or side of a bak is viewed as the 'line' of matrilineage, it is a short leap to suggest that each red disc is a woman at different points along a life-path spanning marriage and death.

Bak.</page><page sequence="13">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 30I male, paternal tobwatobwa. Furthermore the presence of buzzard and canoe motifs at the 'breaking point' of the bak suggests that the strand is the image of the snake of creation itself. The salient themes of sexual reproduction and conflict in the myths and rituals that relate to bak and tobwatobwa also set up an association with heat. The tobwatobwa contracts heat from the salt in estuary spawning beds, and is metaphorically a source of heat as hinona. But more specifically, the 'red' (ket) arm and 'black' (tege) blade express in the colours of conflict the heat of confrontation. This was explained in relation to traditional warfare, where homicide spears were painted with bands of red 'for anger and blood' and black 'for war'. The heat of the bak is primarily a referent of its colours: namely, the red shell discs that combined with the white shell head display the colours of procreation. Thus it is not at all unlikely that the head of the bak represents a new ancestral individual, with a 'voice' of chiming shells to announce that the bak is ritually alive, and to render visually the emanating sound of the newborn. We could even speculate that the head is emerging from between the legs of the matri- lineage. It would appear, then, that the head of the bak is related to the blade of the tobwatobwa and the discs to the handle as an image of personhood-corporate and individual. That is, since both the head and the blade are conceived as natural objects, the individual represented by them is being defined as natural against the artificial persona he becomes when he is socially absorbed. The respective sets of colours reiterate the dichotomy, expressing a shared clan substructure (the red of the handle and discs) against the black and white of individuation (blade and head respectively)12. But note that the nature-culture ascriptions are reversed. As fixed gender associations they are thus cancelled out. What remains, then, are female/maternal images of corporation (the handle and discs) and the male/paternal images of individuality (handle and head). These align- ments obviate the relatedness of the bak and tobwatobwa as economic valuables, since the discs and blade are the items of wealth. It was mentioned that certain objects are classified linguistically as 'animate'. More accurately, certain things cast an animate-category shadow or reflection (kakaunununa) that makes them 'more like people' than objects with ordinary inanimate images (pwapwalulu). Since the kakaunununa is regarded as the 'image' of the spirit or soul of a person, certain things, in other words, project a discernible image of spirit. The bak and tobwatobwa are among these. However, only the bak and tobwatobwa cast an image that is ritually 'hot'-in other words, strong and efficacious in itself. And only particularly fine examples of these objects can be used to solicit the services of a sorcerer or sorceress. Two features determine an object's worth and appropriateness as sorcerers' fare. One is its thinness, the other its length. So that only a long, thin tobwatobwa blade and a long bak of very thin discs are acceptable. These objects, said to be 'strong and hot' in themselves, can be made dangerously hot by magic. For</page><page sequence="14">302 DEBBORA BATTAGLIA example, one sorcery technique involves placing the blade and its handle in a tidal pool for several days to allow salty water to infuse them with heat. The blade is afterwards baked in the sun and then sprayed with a hot substance (such as sassafrass root). A spell at this point is optional. Finally, a tree is named for the victim and struck repeatedly with the axe. Magically transferred in this way, the heat can cause the victim to explode. Furthermore, in carrying the tobwatobwa from place to place, the sorcerer is careful not to allow its shadow to cross his own, as it would instantly kill him. It is the shadow or reflection as an image, not of an ordinary person but of an especially powerful one, that conveys the deadly essence of the sorcery act. This brings us to some interesting conclusions. We have seen that there is congruence on several levels between persons and ceremonial axes and neck- laces. To begin with, beliefs about bodily components and processes are visibly patterned in object representations of the person, objects that (on another level) represent individuals' contributions to ceremonial and ritual occasions. Like- wise, the corporate and individual aspects of personhood are aligned with maternal and paternal, masculine and feminine dynamics in object symbolism. Tensions inherent in these dyadic relationships surface in the institution of cross-cousin relations, and in the objects that mediate them. The fact that tobwatobwa (rather than bak) are the primary ceremonial currency in this area, resonates with the patrilateral focus of these relations and the property problems which underlie them. Lastly, in the metaphysical sphere, there is congruence (bordering on symbolic conflation) between the materialised spirits of powerful persons (the waunak bibiloia and yoyova) and the objects of the materialised ancestor or tubu that form the Segaiya 'corpse'. It would seem that the deceased is being honoured as the holder in perpetuity of this superhuman status; in short, that one identity is the transformation of the other. The irony is that tobwatobwa and bak, on the one hand images of death and tools for sorcerers, are also archetypal images of human potential: the potential of persons to project themselves beyond their everyday limits of space and time. As materialised 'sendings'-shadows and reflections made concrete-they add a detachable mask to the person, a concrete alter ego. This explains, for example, the thinness of blades and discs, which is meaningful not merely as an index of technical skill but of the object's nearness to representing the nature of a powerful spirit sending. It also explains the significance (beyond utility) of length as a representation of spatio-temporal reach or influence (Munn I982). It would seem that by involving themselves in sexual, political and spiritual exchanges people on some level envision supernatural control and, ultimately, their own immortality in the objects they manipulate. At the crux of this projective process is the support/complement dialectic; it is this that provides the departure point for spirit: the 'promise of bliss', the security, to which Malinowski referred in I935. For the Sabarl living on the 'bones of the serpent', it is a promise of no little interest.</page><page sequence="15">DEBBORA BATTAGLIA 303 NOTES Major funding for research was generously provided by the William Wyse Trustees, Smuts Memorial Foundation (University of Cambridge), Esperanza Trust (Royal Anthropological Insti- tute), and Girton College, Cambridge. 1 The Sabarl (Sabara, Sabari) are a dialect group in the Saisai, or Eastern Calvados Chain, area of the Louisiade Archipelago, part of the 'southern Massim' culture region of Papua New Guinea. The (Austronesian) language of the area is Saisai-also called Nimowa. The Sabarl dialect of Saisai is spoken by Sabarl dwellers and Sabarl immigrants on the nearby islands of Nigahau and Panabarli. In I976, the 'ethnographic present' of the article, the Sabarl group numbered 725 and the Saisai roughly I I 70. 2 The flat beads of the bak are for the most part manufactured on Yele (Rossel Island) from the shell of the charna mollusc. The stone tobwatobwa blade is laminated or banded welded tuff or ignimbrite (composition dacite) (Nichols, pers. comm. Axe blades were never manufactured locally. 3 The capacity to remember is inextricably linked to the notion of a 'working' (literally 'beating' -pik) mind. Other terms for person are tolorno and ton1uwotu. A lexicon and grammar of the Saisal language do not yet exist. I am grateful to Father Kevin Toomey for his wordlist, compiled in I 965. ' The lists of 'complements' and 'supports' given here are representative associations which are salient in non-verbal ritual behaviour and verbal explanations of it. They are in no sense to be taken as complete. 5 The term 'reproduction' is used to indicate a process of cultural regeneration that includes the production of new persons (physical and spiritual), new artefacts, new social, economic or political configurations, new versions of myths and the like. 6 In a Panaeati myth, a red seed born of a woman grows into the first mnwadawa (or malauwi) tree and is magically transformed into the first canoe: 'If you look at the inside of the malauwi tree, you will find blood from the woman who gave birth to it. They gave the woman's name to the canoe' (Berde n. d.). 7 The term 'representation' will be used in the broad sense of a created substitute (Gombrich I963: 8), which is not necessarily a formal structural equivalent of its referents (cp. Munn I973: fn.2 I). 8 Inverted, the triangle is commonly read as either a human torso or face. As a perforated shape in carved objects it is said to be 'all the holes of the person'. In canoe decoration, the triangle between the tanatana motif (which represents the top contour of a hull in profile) is said to be the 'person who keeps the canoes from running together'. Compare Scoditti I98 I for triangle iconography and canoe symbolism. 9 The figure of a pigeon sometimes appears on outriggers, where it is said to 'keep the fleet together'. Pigeon-shaped floats are also placed on opposite sides of a fishing net in order to guide the net in closing over the catch. 10 Of course, the replacement of the individual personality is another matter-expressed in the custom of naming younger persons after older ones of the same clan. 'Namesakes' (nolase) become growing memorials to this aspect of the person after his death. l In the indigenous model, men die before women as a result of the greater exposure to sorcery that comes with political ambition. Ritual idioms are most developed within this model. However, when a politically active woman or the child of a notable person dies, there is no significant variation in the structure or scale of memorial events. 12 There is support for this argument in the practice of placing black and white beads around the necks of human corpses before burial.
