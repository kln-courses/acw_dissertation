<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY very valuable addition to the literature of psycho-pathology, inasmuch as it touches on all aspects of the subject in a reasonably clear-thinking and unbiased way, except for the antagonism to analytical methods, and it may be pointed out that this latter opinion is not that of an adherent of any of the three principal analytic schools. R. G. GORDON. Mental Deficiency Practice: The Procedure for the Ascertainment and Disposal of the Mentally Defective. By F. C. SHRUBSALL, M.A., M.D., F.R.C.P., D.P.H., Senior Medical Officer, London County Council, Lecturer in Mental Deficiency, University of London; and A. C. WILLIAMS, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., D.P.H., Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council. (London: University of London Press. I932. Pp. vii + 352. Price I2S. 6d.) This book contains little that will be new to those accustomed to dealing with mental defectives, but the judgment of the authors based on years of administrative experience in the L.C.C., even on well-known problems, is of considerable interest. Their aim, as stated in the preface, is to deal with the subject from the aspect of the steps required for the satisfactory ascer- tainment of mentally defective individuals and their disposal in institutions, special schools or guardianship, etc. It will, therefore, be of more use to the medical practitioner, official administrator or social worker than to the scientist or philosopher. Nevertheless, many important problems will come to the mind of the reader who is interested in the subject of mental deficiency in its wider implications. The historical growth of the concept is clearly described. The duties of the various authorities under existing laws are admirably set out and useful hints given on the question of diagnosis. It is pointed out that mental defectives can be classified in many different ways, e.g., temperamentally, anatomically, legally, clinically, etc. The authors describe some 70 per cent. of their cases clinically as "Primary Amentia" (i.e. due to inherited conditions or germinal variations), and maintain that this primary amentia has its anatomical basis in general or local neuronic hypoplasia. There seems to be no evidence, however, that neuronic hypoplasia has any close relationship to what is legally known as mental deficiency. More especially so, since nothing in the Mental Deficiency Acts limits the term "mental defect" to a defect of the intellectual aspects of mental activity. No one, for example, at the present time can say, with any degree of credibility, that the brain of a high-grade feeble-minded defective or of a person certified as a "moral imbecile" will be demonstrably any different, micro- or macroscopically, from the average human brain. It would seem that the concept of Primary Amentia needs further elucidation. The account given by the authors of mendelism (p. 29) is inadequate, and they still cling to the belief that mental inferiority behaves as a unit recessive character. On the psychological side there is plenty of good material in the book. A convenient abridgment of the Stanford-Binet scale is described for use in diagnosis, and this series deserves to be more widely known. The meaning of scattering is alluded to and the diagnostic value of failure in arithmetical calculations is explained. Sensitivity to pain in many defectives is diminished, and the authors point out that this results in lack of appreciation of other people's feelings. The peculiar psychology of the post-encephalitics is described, and their inability to resist impulses is regarded as being of diagnostic value. 120</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS For some reason the equally characteristic occulo-gyric crises are not mentioned. Generally speaking, this is a carefully prepared manual of good practical value as an aid to the understanding of the actual workings of the present system for coping with the problem of mental deficiency. LIONEL S. PENROSE. Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome. By CYRIL BAILEY. (London: Oxford University Press; Humphrey Milford. I932. Pp. ix + 340. Price I5s.) As might be expected from him, Mr. Cyril Bailey's lectures on Roman religion, recently delivered before the University of California, are of the highest quality, being at once rich in ripe scholarship and in style admirably clear as well as charming. Very skilfully he manages to cover the whole ground by distinguishing what he cautiously terms "phases," which in so far as they can be shown more or less to form a succession in time amount pretty well to the stages of an historical development and one that corresponds closely with the general expansion of ideas and functions accompanying the evolution of a city-state into an empire. In its turn the purely Roman advance from pre-animistic beginnings, through animism and anthropomorphism, to self-conscious forms of cult with an ethico-theological basis, accords entirely with the process or progress that marks the growth of religious experience wherever savagery, or, let us say, barbarism, can be observed as it gradually changes into civilization. In a way Rome, as judged by comparative standards, shows a certain backwardness, as if in its native soul it clung to the old ways and owed to foreign impulsion most of its desire to subject traditional rituals to rationalization. For that reason, more especially when he contrasts the livelier imagination of Greece as it toys with theology-though the effect on cult was perhaps less than might be supposed-the classical scholar is apt to impute to the genuine old Roman rather less religion than he would be ready to do if he were an anthropologist accustomed to dig for the roots of religious faith and practice in stony soil, where only a few feeble germs are likely to reward the most sympathetic research. Mr. Bailey, however, with the illuminating groundwork of Warde Fowler to guide him along the right path, has done his best to include within the "circuit of his musings" everything that belongs to that very miscellaneous group of phenomena labelled "magico-religious" by those theorists who wish to hedge. Nor does he thereupon proceed on the authority of Sir James Frazer to chop this group into two disparate halves with a logical hatchet that treats the magical as equivalent to the pseudo-scientific; as if the use of material symbols implied a materialistic outlook. Mr. Bailey sees clearly enough, for instance, that the silex preserved in the temple of Jupiter Fere- trius had to do with rudimentary religion, though he is even so inclined to speak of "magic" in such a connexion, as if a baby qua rudimentary man was not quite human. But the anthropologist ought to have no doubt at all that a rain-stone goes with religion in the making. Thus the Seligmans have recently shown that side by side in the Nile Valley are Nilotes who worship a rain-god by means of prayer and through the mediation of a king who is killed while yet in his prime, like the priest of Nemi, to keep his intercessional vigour up to the mark; whereas the Nilo-Hamites alongside use rain-stones -often a neolithic cult, the far-travelled "thunder-weapon"-and only employ rain-makers, who are, however, sometimes slain in order to encourage 121</page></plain_text>
