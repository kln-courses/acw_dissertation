<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD PART I : DESCRIPTION AND A RESTORATION * By J. J. ORCHARD The story of how Sir Max Mallowan, accompanied by Professor J?rgen Laessoe, discovered the site of Fort Shalmaneser, and how soon after he decided to begin excavations there is one that is well known to readers of this journal. Also well known is that as work progressed from 1957 to 1963 several rooms were encountered within the fortress which were filled, sometimes to the incredible depth of several feet, with broken and mutilated ivory-work. What is not so well known, or if well known is not so well appreciated, is that these "Ivory Rooms ", as we of the Expedi- tion used to call them, frequently contained many other categories of object as well, which, though subsequently overshadowed by the ivories, were nevertheless more deserving of attention than their present state of publication would suggest. One such category is the series of miniature painted glass plaques which is our subject here,2 for not only are they attractive and interesting in themselves, but they must be counted amongst the earliest examples of painted glass that have survived from antiquity.3 It is with the aim, therefore, of more fully acquainting both archaeologists and historians of glass with the details of these plaques that Dr. Robert H. Brill 4 and I have prepared our present studies. 1 I should like to express my sincere appreciation to Sir Max Mallowan for his interest in this study and for his kind permission to publish those plaques which have not already been treated in print. My warmest thanks are also due to Dr. Isa Salman, lately D.G. of Antiquities, Iraq ; Dr. Fawzi Rashid, Director of the Iraq Museum, Baghdad ; Dr. R. D. Barnett, lately Keeper of the Dept. of Western Asiatic Antiquities, The British Museum, and to Dr. V. E. Crawford, Curator of the Dept. of Ancient Near Eastern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, for many kindnesses in facilitating the study of this rare glass material. 2 To date, the miniature painted glass plaques from Fort Shalmaneser have received but brief notices only. Of these, none covers the series as a whole, and several contain unfortunate errors. The relevant references are: D. Oates, Iraq 21 (1959), 106; M. E. L.

B. Harden, in C. Singer, E. J. Holmyard, A. R. Hall &amp; T. I. Williams (eds.), A History of Technology II (Oxford, 1956), 341 (for a description of the juglet and a bibliography, see Harden, Masterpieces, 17 [1]). Belonging, as they must, to the middle of the millennium and a half which separates the Tuthmosis III juglet from the painted glasswares of the Roman Empire, our Nimrud plaques are thus not only amongst the earliest items of painted glass yet found, but are in our belief the earliest to come from Western Asia. 4 Dr. R. H. Brill's report entitled Laboratory Studies, which forms Part II of this article, is hereafter cited as Brill, Part II.</page><page sequence="2">2 J. J. ORCHARD Introduction Altogether, a total of nine miniature painted glass plaques was found in Fort Shalmaneser. Of these, five (ND. 7,631-3 ; ND. 7,638-9) came from Ivory Room S.W.7 during the British School's 1959 Season, while four (ND. 10,279 a and b ; ND. 10,280 a and b) were recovered from Ivory Room S.W.37 in 1961. Regarded, then, in the simple terms of the Field Catalogue, they fall neatly into two separate groups, divided by both time and place of discovery. Of course, a division of small-find material based on criteria such as these need not in practice mean very much. Yet, as we shall see in due course, a detailed examination of the plaques themselves makes it hard to believe that the groupings are not real, for not only do the plaques within each group possess the same characteristics, but when one group is compared with the other we notice, along with evident similarities, certain specific characteristics which are not shared in common. Hereafter, therefore, we shall refer to the two lots of plaques as the Room S. W.y Group and the Room S. \V.3y Group respectively. The Room S.W.y Group of Plaques (ND. 7,631-3; ND. 7,638-g) The Plaques Of the five plaques which make up the Room S.W.7 Group, two, ND. 7,638-9, are substantially complete, while three, ND. 7,631-3, are broken and preserved in part only. In every case the broken plaques appear to have been broken in antiquity, though one, ND. 7,631, was certainly broken yet again during the course of excava- tion.5 To describe these broken plaques in their present condition, therefore: ND. 7,631 is now represented by two joining fragments, ND. 7,632 by three non- joining fragments (designated : a, b and c) and ND. 7,633 by one fragment only. Having lain for so many centuries in the damp soil of Nimrud, the Room S.W.7 plaques are now in a lamentably advanced state of decomposition, seeming to be no more than fragile biscuits of opaque and finely laminated weathering products. Outwardly, at least, these weathering products are a dense off-white in colour, but wherever, as is often the case, small patches of corrosion have become loosened and detached, the layers within display a delicate silvery-to-pale-golden iridescence shot with pink and green. In none of these exposed and iridescent places can any original glass be observed, but traces of numerous tiny bubbles betray beyond doubt that it was bubbly. As to the probable original character of the glass, given its present appearance, two authorities, Dr. D. B. Harden and Dr. Axel von Saldern have variously expressed the opinion that it was " translucent, greenish-colourless ",e or " clear with (a) slight green tint ".7 Regretfully, it has not yet been practicable to test their respective judgements in the laboratory, but that von Saldern's is likely to be the one borne out is suggested strongly by the fact that a painted plaque from the comparable Room S.W.37 Group, ND. 10,279 b, is now known with certainty to be made of colourless transparent glass.8 In shape the plaques were undoubtedly intended by their makers to be 5 Brill, in correspondence with writer. 6 Harden, Masterpieces, 29 (31). 7 Von Saldern, apud Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, 632 ; and also in VHth Int.

Whether, equally, all were inten- ded to be of the same size is, however, not so certain. Of the five plaques, three, ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638-9, seem to have been of approximately equal dimensions, i.e. width c. 4*2 cm, height c. 3 5 cm (allowing a tolerance regarding both measure- ments of c. o 2 cm), while two, ND. 7,632-3 (both incomplete), look to have been rather taller, perhaps by as much as I '5-2 'O cm. All the plaques are very thin, i.e. C. 0 *2 cm, and it is noticeable that the surface which is painted is both smoother and more finished-looking than the apparently unpainted opposite side. Although, as might be expected, the edges of the plaques have been badly affected by breakage and weathering, certain well preserved portions indicate that they were originally square in profile. This, according to Dr. Brill, was accomplished not by grozing or by fire polishing, but by rubbing against a flat abrasive surface.9 A curious feature of the Room S.W.7 plaques, and one which in particular dis- tinguishes them from the plaques of the Room S.W.37 Group, is that all five are curved, the curvature being in every case about the vertical axis of the plaque (i.e., as defined by its painted decoration. For drawn sections of the plaques, see Plate III a-e). The degree of curvature, however, varies somewhat from plaque to plaque, so that if on paper each curve were to be produced to make a full circle, the resulting circles would range from c. 8 cm to 14 cm in diameter. In its way, this is no less curious, for, as it happens, this range of diameters corresponds closely with that noted for the luxury transparent glass bowls found, largely as sherds, in both Fort Shal- maneser and on the Acropolis Mound at Nimrud.'0 What this correspondence signi- fies, if anything, is not at once apparent, but that it exists seems worth recording. As to the manner in which the curvature of the plaques was achieved, Dr. Harden (who was the first to note its existence with regard to plaque ND. 7,638) has suggested that the plaques were first " cast in flat, one piece mould(s) and made concave thereafter by reheating "'11 Another possibility, which is raised by Dr. Brill, is that the plaques were manufactured and formed in one basic operation by heating pow- dered glass in specially prepared closed moulds corresponding to the curved rec- tangular shape of the plaques.12 The Paintings Just as each Room S.W.7 plaque exhibits some degree of curvature about the vertical axis, so the miniature painting which each bears is executed without excep- tion on the smooth, concave surface (hereafter described as the obverse). In no in- stance is paintwork to be seen on the opposite, convex surface (hereafter described as the reverse), at least by the naked eye. Contrary to what has been stated in earlier notices concerning these paintings, they depict in fact neither one subject,"3 nor 9 Brill, Part II, p. 26. 10 Von Saldern, apud Mallowan, N &amp; R 11, 624-632; and also in VIIth.

ORCHARD three,14 but two. On the smaller of the five plaques, ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638-9, the subject is a winged, human-headed sphinx which advances towards a single tall- stemmed flower, while on the larger (i.e. slightly taller) plaques, ND. 7,632-3, the subject is a winged, anthropomorphic figure who stands with hands raised as if in adoration. As a group, the paintings are executed in a style which to date all those who have commented on the matter are agreed in terming Phoenician.1* As a glance at Plate III a-e will show, the style so described is one, which, while clearly much indebted to the art of Egypt both for its feeling for line and for many motifs, is never- theless possessed of certain elements and/or combinations of elements (e.g. the com- bination of sphinx and flower here) which are not native Egyptian, but expressive it is now increasingly thought of specifically West Semitic concepts and ideas.16 Since the three plaques which are decorated with winged sphinxes include the two least damaged specimens in the Room S.W.7 Group, we will describe them first, reserving the fragmentary winged anthropomorphic figures until afterwards. (a) The Winged Sphinxes If, with the aid of Plate III c-e&gt; comparison is made between the relatively com- plete sphinx paintings ND. 7,638-9 and the incomplete sphinx painting ND. 7,631, it will be seen that the latter in its preserved parts (i.e. the sphinx's head, wings and tail) is so like the former that it is fair to assume that all three paintings were sub- stantially identical in detail, save that sphinxes ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638 advance towards the left and sphinx ND. 7,639 advances towards the right. The description of paintings ND. 7,638-9 which follows may therefore be taken to represent the original appearance of painting ND. 7,631 unless special note is made to the contrary. The scene, which is depicted within a simple linear frame, is one of a winged, human-headed sphinx advancing, tail held loosely erect, towards a solitary flower? a lily with a tall, straight, leafless stem (N.B. in the case of ND. 7,631, the lily is replaced by a papyrus flower). The sphinx is arrayed in an Egyptian nemes head- dress, a collar (suggested rather than realistically rendered by two diagonal bands across the chest), and an apron with two decorative horizontal bands across the hem. Crowning the sphinx's head is a disc supported by a uraeus, while in front of the sphinx's chest hangs a second uraeus, which is itself crowned with a disc (N.B. in the case of painting ND. 7,639, this latter uraeus is no longer preserved, so that its crowning disc appears to float in mid-air in front of the sphinx's chest). The body of the sphinx is leonine, as is indicated not simply by its general form, but by the charac- teristic tuft at the end of the tail. Although, as has been observed, our sphinx paintings are evidently substantially identical, nevertheless it must equally be noted that certain minor differences of detail may be seen. For example, in the case of sphinx ND. 7,638 male genitals are 14 Von Saldern, apud Mallowan, JV &amp; R II, 632 (Section II A, 1-3) ; and in Oppenheim et al., Glass and Glassmaking, 223 (35 a-c), Figs. 33-35.

For this view of Phoenician Egyptianizing art long propounded by R. D. Barnett, see his articles in Iraq 2 (1933), 198 IT. ; PEQ 1939, 16, and JHS 68 (1948), 3; also his Catalogue of the Nimrud Ivories in the British Museum (London, 1957; hereafter, CJV7), 62, 137 ff.</page><page sequence="5">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD 5 depicted, whereas in the case of sphinx ND. 7,639 they are not. Conversely, sphinx ND. 7,639 has been endowed with ribs (represented by three curved strokes), while sphinx ND. 7,638 has none. Also, in the case of the divine disc and uraeus crown belonging to sphinx ND. 7,639, the uraeus is drawn fully visible and draped over the top of the disc, whereas in painting ND. 7,638 the uraeus is partially concealed behind the disc. None of these differences would seem to be of great moment. Rather, they are only what might fairly be expected in repetitive hand-drawn representations of this kind. (b) The Winged Anthropomorphic Figures Unfortunately, as will be seen from Plate III ??-?, neither painting ND. 7,632 nor painting ND. 7,633 is complete. However, from what remains of the winged figures depicted it is hard to believe that, like the three sphinx paintings, they were not substantially alike. Of the two paintings, ND. 7,632 is the more important, for it shows what is no longer to be seen from painting ND. 7,633, namely that the figures were represented standing and that they had four wings.17 Furthermore, the know- ledge that the figures were standing makes it certain on proportional grounds that these painted glass plaques, ND. 7,632-3, were taller than those upon which winged sphinxes are represented. The description of the anthropomorphic figures on these plaques which follows, therefore, will be based on painting ND. 7,632 (figure facing right), painting ND. 7,633 (figure facing left) being referred to only for corroborative purposes or to note some variation in detail. Enclosed within a simple linear frame like that surrounding the sphinx paintings, a four-winged, beardless male figure is shown standing with one leg advanced and both arms raised in the Egyptian gesture of reverent adoration. His wings are fully displayed after the manner of a St. Andrew's Cross (X), two framing his head and shoulders, and two framing his waist and legs. He is arrayed in an Egyptian nemes head-dress and a suit of clothing which by all appearances is identical with that worn by many Egyptian-looking male figures on the Nimrud ivories.18 Though often impressionistically rendered on the ivories, this clothing appears to consist of two major elements. First, there is a short, almost knee-length tunic with full-cut, 17 While it is not within the scope of this article to determine the meaning of the painted representations on the glass plaques from Fort Shalmaneser, those interested in so doing may discover useful contem- porary parallels for our four-winged anthropomor- phic figure amongst the corpus of published Western Asiatic (or presumed Western Asiatic) scaraboid seals. For examples of such seals, some of which carry a Phoenician/Aramaic (?) inscription, see L. Dela- porte, Catalogue des Cylindres I (Mus?e du Louvre, Paris, 1920), 26, PI. 6 (1 b) ; idem II (Paris, 1923), 207, PI. 104 (35) ; G. A. Eisen, Ancient Oriental Cylinders and Other Seals, with a description of the Collec- tion of Mrs. William H. Moore {O.I.P. XLVII ; Chicago, 1940), 33, 57, PI. XIII (121) ; and Mallo- wan, ? &amp; R\, 259, Fig. 238. Likewise closely rele- vant is a remarkable instance of the four-winged figure impressed as a recurring motif around the rim of a broken pottery vessel unearthed by H. Rassam in the Temple of I?tar of Kidmuri on the Acropolis Mound, Nimrud, see R. D. Barnett, JHS 68 (1948), 14, n. 78, PI. VIII g (for an earlier mention by the same author, but without illustration, see Iraq 2 (^S)? 2?6&gt; n. 2). Oddly, perhaps, two-winged rather than four-winged human-headed anthropo- morphic figures are the general rule among the Phoenician ivories found at Nimrud. However, a N. Syrian version of our beardless four-winged male figure may conceivably be represented on two panels of one of the ivory-veneered chair-backs from FS.

ORCHARD half-length sleeves (see best in painting ND. 7,633, Plate III b) and a sash-like belt at the waist (N.B. the lower parts of this tunic are entirely missing from paintings ND. 7^32-3, but observably the legs of the figure in painting ND. 7,632 are bare to the knee, see Plate III a). Then, above this tunic, is an ankle-length mantle, which, by convention, is so draped as to cover the wearer's back while leaving his front exposed (N.B. in painting ND. 7,632 the hem of the mantle is to be seen behind the figure's right leg, from whence it rises diagonally upwards towards the calf of his left leg). Crowning the figure's head is a disc, which in painting ND. 7,633 is flanked on either side by a uraeus (one clear, the other almost obliterated).19 In the field surrounding the figure are the plain but extravagantly curving stems of some kind of plant or shrub, which issues from the ground a little behind the figure's back (N.B. there is no sign whatsoever of this plant or shrub in painting ND. 7,633, from which it seems to have been omitted). Almost certainly this shrub was represented in flower, but of its blooms (if there were any) none are now to be seen. The Paints Following the foregoing detailed account of the subject matter of the Room S.W.7 paintings on glass, something must now be said of the paints used. Firstly, for the purpose of delineating the sphinxes and winged anthropomorphic figures in detail a black paint was prepared, the base of which was almost certainly bituminous, though this has yet to be proved absolutely.20 This was applied with a fine drawing imple- ment, perhaps a kind of pen rather than a brush, and adhered so tenaciously to the surface of the plaques that even now it is extraordinarily well preserved. After the sphinxes and winged anthropomorphic figures had been completed in black line, a second paint, this time seemingly coloured with finely-ground Egyptian blue frit,21 was employed solidly to colour in certain selected details of the paintings, with the result that not only was the general attractiveness of the paintings much enhanced, but those details chosen were caused to stand out clearly and prominently. This Egyptian blue paint, whatever was used as a medium, was manifestly less resilient to moisture than the black, for much of it has now vanished completely. However, ample vestiges still remain both firmly to establish its use and to allow, as will shortly be demonstrated, a fairly confident restoration of one of the Room S.W.7 paintings on glass in its entirety. Whether other paints, in particular white (as a general back- ground colour) and red (as a supplement to the blue) were used must remain for the present a matter for speculation, for the evidence, as will be seen from Dr. Brill's report, is as yet not decisive for the former,22 and altogether lacking for the latter.23 Sphinx Painting ND. 7,6^,9. An attempted restoration In our description of the Room S.W.7 miniature paintings on glass a point which has been repeatedly stressed is their similarity in style and detailed execution. Indeed, 19 For this same divine crown in inlaid Phoenician ivorywork, see that worn by a four-winged, falcon- headed, anthropomorphic figure found immediately to the West of Room S.W.7 m ^ort Shalmaneser : Mallowan, ?? &amp; R II, Fig. 434. 20 Brill, Part II, p. 34 if. 21 Brill, Part II, p. 28. 22 Brill, Part II, pp. 28, 36-37. 23 Brill, Part II, p. 28.</page><page sequence="7">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD 7 so marked is this similarity that the paintings with their now right-facing, now left- facing orientation give an impression almost of mirror images. As this can hardly be accidental, the most plausible explanation would seem to be that in executing the paintings (the original number of which is of course unknown) the painter or painters worked from a set of previously prepared master sketches. This " mass-produced " quality in the paintings, once recognized, must of necessity raise the question whether any of the paintings may actually be restored, for if all are in substance copies it follows that information preserved by, for example, one sphinx painting may be used to make good damaged areas in another. Upon this hypothesis, therefore, it is pro- posed here to take the best preserved of all the Room S.W.7 paintings, namely sphinx painting ND. 7,639 (Plate III d) and restore it step by step, resorting to the more damaged sphinx paintings ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638 (Plate III c and e) wherever these may be of material assistance. It will be evident at once that the first step towards restoring painting ND. 7,639 to its original appearance must be to recreate its primary delineation in black paint. Fortunately, so well is ND. 7,639 preserved in this respect that much may be achieved simply by connecting up and continuing broken but otherwise perfectly assured lines. In this way may be restored the sphinx's wings, the line of its back, the line of its forehead, its apron, the strands of its collar, the central portion of its tail, its hind paws, the stem of the lily and the frame surrounding the entire composition. This done, the painting in its black stage already presents an air of near completeness, but still lacunae remain, viz. the sphinx's front paws, its ear, the forward line of its nemes head-dress, the tuft at the end of its tail and the uraeus hanging down from its chest (N.B. the former presence of this uraeus is firmly indicated (a) by its small but well preserved disc-crown floating in front of the sphinx's chest, and (b) by traces of its body against the sphinx's advanced left foreleg). As it happens, all these missing items are well preserved in sphinx painting ND. 7,638 (Plate III e)y so that to transfer them to ND. 7,639 is not only a simple exercise, but serves to complete that painting in its black delineated form (see Fig. 1 a). To restore ND. 7,639 to its original appear- ance, therefore, it would seem now that our remaining task is but to fill in those specific details, which, one by one, may be shown to have been painted blue. To begin with those traces of blue paint which require least discussion, let us examine those to be seen on the sphinx's dress and on its accompanying lily. From the drawing of painting ND. 7,639 on Plate III ?where all vestiges of blue paintwork have been indicated in solid black, it will be observed that the sphinx's nemes head- dress retains no less than five patches of blue paint : one just below the uraeus-sup- ported disc-crown, two immediately above the sphinx's shoulder and two on the visible lappet of the nemes head-dress as it follows the curve of the sphinx's chest. This distribution of blue paint traces within the area of the head-dress is thus so wide and, be it noted, so precisely delimited by the head-dress's black-painted outline that the purposeful application of blue paint to this feature may readily be accepted without misgivings. Similarly, it will further be seen that the sphinx's rather simplified collar bears a substantial patch of blue on its upper strand. This patch is again so precisely bounded by the painter's black lines that it can scarcely be other than intentional, showing accordingly that the sphinx's collar no less than its head-dress was carefully painted blue. Where a small difficulty now arises is in deciding whether blue paint</page><page sequence="8">J. J. ORCHARD 3 u e C ?? Q w ??a si j3 S ?/3 is boJ3 e-0 bo S C ?d .a OJ .? ?, ? ? 'S- ?S 72 U?

By analogy with the treatment accorded to the sphinx's two-strand collar, it might fairly be expected that the two transverse bands at the hem of the apron were likewise painted blue. Yet, if this was the case, not a trace of blue paint is now to be seen in this area of painting ND. 7,639. Happily, such uncertainty as must otherwise have prevailed here is convincingly removed by reference to the identical apron worn by sphinx ND. 7,638 (Plate III e)&gt; where?it will be noted?the lower band of decoration at the hem displays a clear patch of blue towards its rearward end. On the assumption made throughout this study that restoration by direct comparison is both permissible and practicable, it will at once be perceived that this important piece of evidence allows in the most satisfying way the complete restoration of blue paint- work to the clothing of sphinx ND. 7,639, and in consequence our attention may without further delay be turned to the lily towards which the sphinx moves. Al- though, in their present state, neither of the single flowers accompanying sphinxes ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638 (Plate III c and e) shows any trace of added colour, by good fortune the lily represented on plaque ND. 7,639 itself carries two patches of blue paint, one large and one small, on the petal nearest the sphinx. In view of the fact that the lily is a wholly symmetrical motif, exhibiting but two petals in all, it is impossible to conceive that blue paint so plainly applied to one petal should not have been applied to the other. Hence, the blue paintwork on this feature may be restored with no less confidence than that on the sphinx's dress. Having made good progress thus far, it is now time for us to examine those portions of sphinx painting ND. 7,639, which, though evidently painted blue to some extent, are less easy to assess than those with which we have just dealt. These more difficult portions with which we shall now be concerned are specifically the sphinx's wings and what may be termed its " divine insignia ", that is to say, its ?/ra?z?y-supported disc-crown and the little disc-crowned uraeus pendent from its chest. To take the sphinx's divine insignia first, it will be seen from our drawing of painting ND. 7,639 on Plate III d that the diminutive disc-crown which constitutes the most obvious evidence for the sphinx's now obliterated pendent uraeus (see pp. 4 and 7 above) is wholly coloured in with blue paint. So plainly deliberate is this application of blue that it follows at once to wonder how the missing uraeus itself was treated. Fortu- nately, as in the case of the decorative bands on sphinx ND. 7,639's apron, the sphinx depicted on plaque ND. 7,638 still retains enough traces of blue paintwork to be of assistance here. As will be seen from our drawing ofthat painting on Plate III e not only is the sphinx's pendent uraeus well preserved in black outline, but it exhibits two clear patches of blue paint, one on the uraeus's outspread hood and the other on the slender part of its body, just prior to the point where it curves upwards in front of the sphinx's advanced left foreleg. With such very positive evidence as this to rely on, there can scarcely be any doubt that the pendent uraeus now missing from painting ND. 7,639 was, like its preserved disc-crown, painted blue. But what then of the t/ram-supported disc-crown on top of the sphinx's head ? Were both disc and uraeus painted blue originally like the disc-crowned uraeus hanging from the sphinx's chest ? Or, were both left plain and unpainted ? Alternatively, was the disc alone painted blue and its supporting ureaus left plain, or vice versa ? Unhelpfully for the solution of this problem, not one of the crowning discs worn by the sphinxes on our</page><page sequence="10">IO J. J. ORCHARD plaques ND. 7,63i/ND. 7,638-9 betrays the least trace of blue, nor, moreover, do those worn by our winged anthropomorphic figures on plaques ND. 7,632-3 (Plate III a and b). Added to this, not one of the tiny uraei which accompany these disc- crowns shows any trace of blue either. In the absence, therefore, of any firm guidance in the form of blue paint traces, it must be necessary here, if we are to attempt to restore colour to this area of painting ND. 7,639, to put forward some reasoned justification. To begin with, therefore, the first possibility which must deserve our serious atten- tion is that neither the sphinx's black-delineated disc-crown nor its accompanying uraeus was treated with a second colour. While, admittedly, this has the attraction of corresponding exactly with present appearances, there are at least two objections which may be raised against it. Firstly and most importantly, it may be objected that the absence of blue paint from one feature or another of the Room S.W.7 paintings does not, by itself, indicate that blue paint was not originally present. On the con- trary, in view of the observed solubility and fugitiveness of this paint under damp conditions, it is clear that each debatably blue-painted area must be assessed indi- vidually on its own merits in relation to those traces of blue paint which are still preserved on the Room S.W.7 plaques at large. Our second objection, which is more intuitive in character, is that the disc-crown and its supporting uraeus present an unsatisfying and unfinished look without somewhere a touch of colour. Now although neither of these objections has sufficient force wholly to set aside the idea that the disc and its uraeus may have been left plain, together they are certainly sufficient to make it worth debating how, if blue paint was indeed present, it was deployed. Was it, to re-state the possibilities, applied : (A) both to the disc-crown and to the uraeus&gt; (B) to the uraeus alone, or (C) to the disc-crown alone? At first glance, the example afforded by the restored uraeus pendent from the sphinx's chest would seem to favour possibility (A), for as has been shown, both it and its diminutive crowning disc were painted blue. Unfortunately, however, this instant solution is marred by two fatal weaknesses. In the first place, it involves the comparison not of like with like, our scrupulous practice hitherto, but on the con- trary seeks to compare two quite distinct and separate features (i.e., the sphinx's two divine insignia), inferring that the blue paint treatment accorded to one must necessarily have been accorded to the other. Secondly, it completely ignores what from a careful examination of the Room S.W.7 paintings may be deduced as the two guiding principles governing their embellishment with blue paint. These last- mentioned two guiding principles, we must at once hasten to remark, have not as yet been alluded to or defined in this article for the purely practical reason that, with nothing to aid us save photographs and drawings of the paintings in their present woefully weathered condition, they have been altogether too difficult to explain clearly. However, now that the greater part of sphinx painting ND. 7,639 has been restored, detail by detail, the means exist not only for the reader to observe these two guiding principles very easily, but to comprehend their relevance to the matter immediately at issue. If reference be made, therefore, to Fig. 1 ?, which shows painting ND. 7,639 as it has been restored up to this present point in our discussion, it will be seen that in applying blue paint to the sphinx and its accompanying lily the painter has sought</page><page sequence="11">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD I I to make certain details stand out both prominently and clearly, e.g. the sphinx's nemes head-dress, the bands of the collar about its neck, the petals of the lily, etc. This desire on the part of the painter to emphasize detail with clarity is so striking, so imme- diately apparent, that it must seem almost prosaic to point out that it is this which constitutes the first principle that has guided him in embellishing his work with blue. However, prosaic or not, this it undoubtedly is, and the second principle stems directly from it, namely, that in order to ensure that clarity of emphasis which was his aim, the painter has been meticulous to avoid any broad contiguity between two or more blue-painted details. Either, as in the case of the bands at the hem of the sphinx's apron, his blue-painted details are separated by an unpainted zone, or, as in the case of the sphinx's two-strand collar, they connect with other blue-painted details on a narrow front only. Thus, not a single blue-painted detail in his painting is indistinct or blurred through being clumsily merged with another. If, then, in the light of what has just been said, we return to consider whether both the disc-crown and the uraeus on top of the sphinx's head were painted blue, it must at once be recognized that this is a most unlikely restoration, for in view of the fact that virtually half of the serpent's body lies on top of the disc it would inevitably have become merged with and to a very large extent indistinguishable from the disc. What, then, of alternative possibilities (B) and (C) ? Clearly, neither of these latter violates the two principles which guided the painter in embellishing his work with blue. Hence, we must look for some other criterion to determine the most acceptable solution. Fortunately, as it happens, we have not far to search, for it resides in that generally acknowledged difference in iconographie status which exists between the disc and the uraeus in this Egyptian crown of divinity. On the one hand, the disc stands as the symbol of great solar divinity in its various Egyptian theological aspects, while the uraeus, embodiment of Edjo, goddess of Buto in the Nile Delta, is but an ancillary guarding supporter. Whether the painter of ND. 7,639, who was certainly no Egyptian, was sufficiently sensitive of such distinctions to prefer the disc for treat- ment with colour rather than the uraeus is, of course, one of those moot points which constantly arise in the critical assessment of Egyptian-style Phoenician art-works. However, any qualms which may here be aroused by the positioning of the uraeus on top of the disc must surely be put aside when the uraeus-supported disc-crowns in the other Room S.W.7 paintings are taken into account, for in every case the uraeus is in part masked by and therefore clearly dominated by the disc. If one element in sphinx ND. 7,639's uraeus-supported disc-crown was coloured, therefore, rather than the other, probability must overwhelmingly favour the disc. Having dealt with its " divine insignia ", there remain now only the two wings of sphinx ND. 7,639 to be filled in with blue. Yet, before we attempt this, it will be worthwhile momentarily to take a closer look at the wings themselves, for their delineation in black paint affords at least two interesting insights into the character of the Room S.W.7 paintings. From Plate III a-e, it will be seen that neither the wings of the sphinx on plaque ND. 7,639, nor those of any of the other sphinxes and winged anthropomorphic figures of the Room S.W.7 Group show any strong pretence at realism, save in their simple basic outlines. On the contrary, within those outlines the details of the wings have been conventionalized into a pattern of variously-sized compartments, whose shapes and arrangement serve to suggest rather than positively</page><page sequence="12">12 J. J. ORCHARD to resemble the feathers to which they correspond. Furthermore, each compartment is surrounded by a narrow border or zone which effectively isolates it from its imme- diate neighbours. Now this is an odd way for wings to be drawn, as will be apprecia- ted if reference is made ahead to Plate III/to see how another Phoenician glass painter, the painter of the Room S.W.37 Group of glass plaques, has tackled the same task. Here the wing concerned, that of a winged anthropomorphic figure, is plainly more simple, more direct in execution, despite the damage it has suffered, and is noticeably without that division into carefully isolated compartments that is characteristic of the wings of the Room S.W.7 sphinxes and anthropomorphic figures. That this division into isolated compartments fulfilled a practical end in the Room S.W.7 paintings cannot be doubted, for, in the first place, the compartments contain numerous vestiges of blue paintwork, and in the second, this method of representation accords precisely with those principles, which, as has been shown, governed the application of blue to the paintings. In the case of the sphinxes, for example, this compartmental treatment has made it possible for the wing fully displayed to be distinguished from that behind it, and in the case of the sphinxes and anthropomorphic figures at large it has made it possible for the feathers of the wings to be articulated both strikingly and without confusion. In short, the conclu- sion prompted by this analysis of the wings of the sphinxes and anthropomorphic figures on the Room S.W.7 plaques is that each painting was specifically designed to receive colour. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that had chance removed all traces of additional colour from the Room S.W.7 plaques, its former presence (though, note, not its precise distribution) could have been deduced with certainty simply from the way in which the sphinxes and anthropomorphic figures have been drawn in black. As for the second insight which the wings of the sphinxes and anthropomorphic figures give into the character of the Room S.W.7 paintings, this has to do with the inspiration of the paintings and is again concerned with the way in which the wings have been divided into shaped compartments surrounded by separating zones. Immediately above, our explanation for this treatment was that it facilitated the clear articulation of the wings with blue paint. Yet, while this is undeniable as far as it goes, it is still a most curious solution to devise if it be considered that the art of painting commonly involves direct contacts and contrasts between colours, not their separation by neutral unpainted zones. The suspicion, therefore, is hard to suppress that for the purpose in hand, and doubtless on many other occasions too, the painter(s) of the Room S.W.7 plaques borrowed an effect which properly belonged to some other class of artist-craftsmen. Fortunately, the problem of identifying these other artist-craftsmen is not difficult to solve, for in Phoenicia during the early cen- turies of the ist millennium b.c. there is known to have been at least one group of artist-craftsmen, who not only drew extensively on Egyptian concepts of iconography and design, but who also obtained much of their special impact by the skilfull arrangement and juxtaposition of separate and carefully-shaped coloured compart- ments. These were the carvers and inlayers of fine inlaid ivorywork.24 To appreciate the debt which the painter(s) of the Room S.W.7 plaques owed to these workers, we 24 Barnett, CNI, 156-7.</page><page sequence="13">PLATE I a.

Only the sphinx's wings now remain to be considered, and for this it will be convenient to take the half-concealed left wing first. As will be seen from Plate III d, this has been divided by the painter into three elongated compart- ments, but although these are reasonably well preserved in black outline they betray not a trace of blue paint. For assistance here, therefore, it will be necessary for us to see what the comparable parts of sphinx paintings ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638 have to show. Unfortunately, of these two paintings only ND. 7,631 carries blue paint traces, and these are so infinitesimal that Dr. Brill, who observed them, is inclined to regard them with caution.26 However, in the light of all the discussion that has gone before, their specific presence within the first and second wing-compartments (i.e. counting from the back of the sphinx's head) may perhaps be held, at least tentatively, to suggest original blue paintwork here. At all events, on the basis of these traces, meagre as they are, we venture to restore blue paint to the corresponding wing of sphinx ND. 7,639. As for sphinx ND. 7,639*8 right wing, this, being fully displayed, presents to the viewer a whole multiplicity of compartments which are designed to suggest flight- and covert-feathers. That the flight-feathers were painted blue may be affirmed at once, for no less than five of a total eleven show substantial vestiges of that colour. However, the covert-feather area of the wing is a different matter, and in fact presents us with the most intriguing problem of all those that have so far arisen in the restoration of painting ND. 7,639. From Plate III c-e&gt; it will be noted that the covert-feather area under consideration is well delineated in black only in painting ND. 7,639, the corresponding portions of sphinx paintings ND. 7,631 and ND. 7,638 being either largely or completely obli- terated. From painting ND. 7,639 alone, therefore, can we see that the covert-feather area was divided into two unequal and sinuous compartments which are surrounded by narrow unpainted zones. Neither of the covert-feather compartments shows any trace of colour, yet the fact that the compartments exist seems to suggest that the application of colour was contemplated. Was that colour blue? If what we have observed hitherto of the work-methods of the painter(s) of the Room S.W.7 plaques is correct, this must seem very unlikely, for the use of blue here would have blurred and to a large extent obscured the rearward parts of the sphinx's blue-painted nemes head-dress. What else, therefore, we must ask, could have been done? All in all, there appear to be only two alternatives. Either the covert-feather compartments were left plain, or another colour in addition to blue was used. To decide between the two is not easy, for both are open to some objection. The first, for example, fails to explain why the compartments should have been drawn at all, while the second has no perceptible evidence to support it other than the existence of the compartments and the apparent inappropriateness of blue as a filler. On balance, the existence of the compartments favours in our opinion the use of another colour, but in the absence 18 Mallowan, JV &amp; R II, 546, Fig. 477. J Brill, Part II, p. 28. IR 2</page><page sequence="17">14 J- J. ORCHARD of any detectable traces, either on ND. 7,639 or any of the other Room S.W.7 plaques, its identity can only be a matter for informed guesswork. For instance, if, as we have suggested, Phoenician ivory-workers inspired the painter(s) of the Room S.W.7 plaques, red is a colour which must merit serious consideration, for by the ivory- inlayers it was very commonly employed to accompany blue, witness the inlaid Phoenician ivories from, for example, Samaria 27 and Nimrud.28 However, having noted this possibility that red might have been the colour which we are seeking, we must confess ourselves to be not very enthusiastic about it. Firstly (and perhaps less weightily), its use in the context at issue seems to us aesthetically unpleasing, and secondly, from our extensive practical experience of handling the inlaid Phoenician ivories from Nimrud we must observe that red is rarely if ever used for wing coverts, save in alternation with blue. In our view, the colour which most strongly recom- mends itself, both aesthetically and on grounds of probability is gold in the form of gold leaf. This suggestion may surprise the reader, especially when the minute size of the compartments concerned is considered. However, there are several points which deserve to be noted in its favour : (1) gold leaf overlays of comparable delicacy and smallness are still to be seen on certain of the Nimrud ivories,29 (2) Phoenician inlaid ivories suggestive of a blue-and-gold colour scheme (i.e. apparently excluding red) have been discovered in Fort Shalmaneser,30 and (3) at Samaria, Crowfoot found in ninth/eighth century b.c. context two now opaque-white glass covert- feather inlays covered on one side with gold leaf.31 Furthermore, it may also be per- missible to remark that not only the present absence of gold leaf from the Room S.W.7 plaques but also their damaged state may well be attributable to the same cause that has been suggested with regard to the Nimrud ivories, i.e. that the pieces were broken and the gold painstakingly stripped off by persons unknown during the events accompanying or following the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.32 Of course, if this suggestion of ours that gold leaf as well as blue paint was applied to the Room S.W.7 plaques is accepted, a totally new vision of painting ND. 7,639 emerges in the sense that, if gold leaf is envisaged on the sphinx's right wing, its existence on other details may be suspected as well. To identify these must again, inevitably, be a matter of guesswork, but from our own observations of Phoenician gold leaf-work on ivory we would tentatively propose : (a) the stem of the lily- flower and its tiny diamond of formalized stamens, (b) the space in front of and between the two strands of the sphinx's collar, and (c) the sphinx's apron (N.B., 27 For specimen examples, see J. W. and G. M. Crowfoot, Samaria-Sebaste 2. Early Ivories from Samaria (London, 1938; hereafter, Samaria-Sebaste 2), PI. II : 1 (p. 14) ; PI. Ill : 1 (p. 16) ; PI.

I (in colour). 30 Unpublished. 31 J. W. and G. M. Crowfoot, Samaria-Sebaste 2, 45, PI. XXIV, 1. It must be noted that in addition to the two specifically quoted inlays where glass and gold leaf were found still in contact, more than ten similar glass inlays and at least six loose gold leaf overlays from them were recovered at the same time. 32 For this explanation of the disappearance of gold leaf from the Nimrud ivories, see D. Oates, Iraq 23 (1961), 5 ; M. E. L. Mallowan, Iraq 21 (1959), 95; JV6? R II, 413, 417, 576.</page><page sequence="18">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD 15 all these suggested gold-covered areas are shown with dotted stippling in our final restoration of painting ND. 7,639 on Fig. id). In only one place is it possible posi- tively to argue for the restoration of gold leaf, and that is to the large disc-crown on top of the sphinx's head, which earlier (see p. 11) we argued to have been painted blue. In consideration, however, of the likelihood that the Room S.W.7 paintings embodied not two colours but three, the third colour being gold, it will be evident that what was most validly pertinent in our earlier reasoning was that the disc-crown possessed a prior claim to colour over its supporting uraeus. Clearly, gold would be infinitely more appropriate for a solar disc, and if this be accepted we may pre- sumably without offence transfer blue to the uraeus. Thus, with this last touch, our restoration of painting ND. 7,639 is complete (see Fig. 1 d) and we may now turn to the Room S.W.37 Group of painted plaques. The Room S.W.37 Group of Plaques (ND. 10,27g a and b; ND. 10,280 a and b) The Plaques Like the painted glass plaques from Room S.W.7, those from Room S.W.37 are aU in an advanced state of decomposition. Indeed, in the case of plaque ND. 10,280 b decomposition and disintegration have proceeded to such an extent that the piece now presents little more than a consolidated skin of weathering products. In terms of outward colour, however, a certain difference is to be detected between the two Groups in that the plaques from Room S.W.37 appear not opaque off-white, but opaque buff.33 That the glass of the Room S.W.37 plaques was originally trans- parent, colourless and bubbly there can be not a shadow of doubt, for Dr. Brill has been fortunate enough to find a tiny wafer of undecomposed glass within the thick- ness of plaque ND. 10,279 D 34 (N.B. this plaque was sent from London to Corning several years ago for examination, but disintegrated badly in transit). As with the Room S.W.7 plaques, wherever surface flaking has exposed glimpses of the plaques' interior a light golden iridescence is to be seen, shot with pale pink and green. By unlucky chance not one of the four Room S.W.37 plaques is complete, but from what remains of them it seems clear that only three were approximately rectan- gular. The exception is plaque ND. 10,279 D&gt; which in outline suggests part of a wing (see Plate II g).30 In size the rectangular pieces seem to have been closely similar to the larger of the Room S.W.7 plaques, that is to say, between 30-4-0 cm in width and, to judge from the proportions of the paintings which they bear, ?.5*5 cm in height. All four plaques seem to have been c. o ? 2-0 ? 3 cm in thickness, though, as has already been noted, plaque ND. 10,280 b is now reduced to less than ? ? 1 cm due to the combined effects of decomposition and flaking from the reverse. Unlike the Room S.W.7 plaques, those from Room S.W.37 snow no sign of curvature at all, but are (or were in the case of plaque ND. 10,280 b, see Catalogue section, p. 21) uniformly flat.36 All the plaques without exception were broken in antiquity. 33 Brill, Part II, p. 24. 34 Brill, Part II, pp. 24-27. 36 In the view of von Saldern, apud Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, 632, this item was originally rectangular like the other Room S.W.37 plaques. The same is repeated by him, perhaps a little more tentatively, in Oppenheim et al., Glass and Glassmaking, 223 (35 d). 38 Brill, Part II, p. 25.</page><page sequence="19">16 J. J. ORCHARD The Paintings (Plates Uf-h, IIIf and h) Altogether three subjects are represented on the Room S.W.37 glass plaques. These are, firstly, a Sacred Tree with flowers, buds and voluted branches (ND. 10.279 a 5 ND. 10,280 a); secondly, a winged anthropomorphic figure (ND. 10.280 b), and thirdly, the feathers of a wing (ND. 10,279 D)? All are delicately delineated with a black paint, the character of which appears to be closely similar to that used by the painter(s) of the Room S.W.7 plaques.37 In style the paintings are once again Phoenician, but the manner in which they are executed seems to differ from the Room S.W.7 paintings in being somewhat bolder and less minutely detailed. Moreover, in painting ND. 10,280 b, that of the winged anthropomorphic figure, the figure's sole remaining wing fails to show any sign of that division into small, narrowly-bordered compartments which is so remarkable in the wings of the Room S.W.7 Group of paintings. Of course, this last observation must not be taken to signify that additional colour was not in some measure applied to the Room S.W.37 plaques, either in the form of paint, gold leaf or both. However, it should be noted that if such additional colour was indeed applied originally, there is no sign of it now, nor does the manner in which the Room S.W.37 subjects are delineated in black necessarily imply it. But let us examine those subjects in detail. (a) The Sacred Trees Although it has proved impossible to trace plaque ND. 10,279 a for this present study, it is our firm recollection that the Sacred Tree which it bore was similar to, if not identical with that, considerably less well preserved, on plaque ND. 10,280 a. As will be seen from our drawing of ND. 10,280 a on Plate III A, the Tree concerned is of the common Phoenician type with flowers, buds and upward-curving voluted branches symmetrically disposed on either side of the trunk. At the foot of the trunk, on the left-hand side (as viewed), may be detected a single diagonal line, which is the last vestige of a long, flowering stem which trailed off along the ground to the left (N.B. this stem must have been matched by a similar stem on the right-hand side of the trunk, which is now obliterated).38 This stem is of some importance in that, poorly preserved as it is, it links the Sacred Tree with our next subject. (b) The Winged Anthropomorphic Figure Of the winged anthropomorphic figure on plaque ND. 10,280 b little more than the lower half is now preserved. Nevertheless, this is quite enough to show that when complete it resembled such Egyptian divinities as Isis and Nephthys represented with their winged arms protectively outstretched. Whether our figure here was intended to be male or female there seems no way of telling, for its dress, consisting of an ankle-length robe arranged so as to leave one leg exposed, is of a type worn by both male 39 and female 40 winged protective figures on the Nimrud ivories. The figure rests its lowered right wing on an upright flower on the ground at its feet. This flower, there is little doubt, is the floral terminal ofthat stem which, above, we noted 37 Brill, Part II, p. 34. 38 This representation of antithetical flowering stems, either springing from, or descending to the base of the Sacred Tree is a commonplace of Phoeni- cian art. For examples in ivory-work, see Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, Figs, 425, 467, 477, 508 and 527. 39 Mallowan, jV &amp; R II, Fig. 495. 40 Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, Fig. 482.</page><page sequence="20">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD I 7 as trailing away from the Sacred Tree on plaque ND. 10,280 a, and shows that in its original setting the Winged Figure guarded the Sacred Tree. (c) The Wing Owing to the fact that the painted surface of ND. 10,279 b has totally disintegrated since its original discovery, confidence that its decoration consisted of the radiating feathers of a wing must rest on our description of the piece in the Nimrud Expedition Field Catalogue for 1961 and on the fact that the plaque itself is shaped like a wing- tip. It may also be observed that when this item was examined by Dr. Axel von Saldern, prior to its despatch to Corning (see p. 15 above), his identification of its design was tentatively the same as our own.41 In the foregoing pages our intentions have been twofold. Firstly, we have attempted to set down as full a description as possible of these extraordinary and unquestionably very early paintings on glass from Western Asia. Secondly, in order that the exquisite quality of these paintings may be the more completely appreciated, we have attempted to restore the best preserved of them to what must closely, if not precisely resemble its pristine appearance. That there remain other aspects of these plaques which require attention must be as evident to the reader as the fact that, given the length limitations of a journal article, we are precluded from dealing with them here. For example, in what archaeological context were the plaques discovered within Rooms S.W.7 an&lt;^ S.W.37 of Fort Shalmaneser, and for what purpose may they have been used ? Also, how closely is it possible to date them, given that they can scarcely have been manufactured later than 612 b.c. ? To answer these questions we are preparing a special Part III to this study, which, it is hoped, will appear very shortly in a subsequent issue of this journal. CATALOGUE Part I : The Room S. W. 7 Group of Miniature Painted Glass Plaques (found during the jg?8 Nimrud season) ND. 7,631 Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Nos. 59.107.25-26. Object : Top half of a small, apparently rectangular plaque with painted decoration. Two joining fragments. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque off-white due to advanced decomposition. Spotted with soil accretions. Dimensions : max. H. as preserved 1 -75 cm ; W. 4-4 cm ; max. Th. 0*2 cm. Special Features : The plaque is curved about its vertical axis (as defined by its painted decoration). For section, see Plate III ?r. Painting executed on concave surface. Design : Plates lie and IIIc. The left hand fragment (MMA. 59.107.25) of this piece shows the head of a human-headed winged sphinx facing left towards a single, straight-stemmed papyrus flower. On its head the sphinx wears what appears to be an Egyptian nemes head-dress surmounted by a disc and uraeus. The right hand fragment (MMA. 59.107.26) shows the greater part of the sphinx's wings and the arched end of its tufted tail. The sphinx, along with its accompanying stem of papyrus, is enclosed by a rectangular, fine-line frame. Paints : Both the sphinx and its accompanying papyrus flower are delicately delineated in black 41 Von Saldern, apud Mallowan, ?" &amp; R II, 632; and also in Oppenheim et al., Glass and Glassmaking, 223 (35 d).</page><page sequence="21">18 J.

Minute traces of blue paint are to be detected in the first and second compartments of the sphinx's right wing (i.e. counting from the back of the sphinx's head), see Brill, Part II, p. 28. Remarks : In 1959, when the two joining fragments which make up this item were despatched by the British School to the Metropolitan Museum, they were unfortunately accompanied by a packing slip which described them as " ND. 7,631 " and " ND. 7,633 ". On the basis of this clerical error, they were taken by the Museum staff to be two separate objects and were accordingly registered under two different, albeit consecutive Museum numbers. This, in turn, was to have its own unfortunate conse- quences, for, when Dr. Axel von Saldern came to study the fragments in the Museum in order to pre- pare his report on the Glass from Nimrud for inclusion in Sir Max Mallowan's Nimrud and its Remains, he was himself misled into annotating them as two separate items, one (MMA. 59.107.25) under the correct Field Number, ND. 7,631, the other (MMA. 59.107.26) under the erroneous Field Number, ND. 7,633. The result of this was not simply that a mistake in numbering was eventually committed to print, but that in addition two wholly mistaken descriptions of our fragments were published as well, viz., " a youth facing left, with part of sceptre (?) " and " part of (a) lotus " (see von Saldern, apud Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, 632 (Section II A, 1-2). Note : These descriptions are repeated by him in Oppenheim et al., Glass and Glassmaking, 223 (35, a-b), where one of the accompanying illustrations, Fig. 34, is turned on end so as to conform with his wrong interpretation). ND. 7,632 a-c : Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Unregistered. Object : Three separate fragments (two of which, a, and b, have been incorrectly joined and moun- ted on thin card, see Plate II a) of a small, apparently rectangular plaque with painted decoration. These fragments (as viewed) represent respectively : a. the top right hand quarter of the plaque ; b. part of the top left hand quarter of the plaque, and c. part of the bottom left hand quarter, including a portion of the bottom edge. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque off-white due to advanced decomposition. Spotted with soil accretions. Despite decomposition former glass clearly bubbly. Detached flakes exhibit a greenish-golden iridescence. Dimensions : Frag, a : max. H. as preserved 2 ? 75 cm ; max. W. as preserved 2 -05 cm. Frag, b : 1 -9 x 1 *05 cm. Frag, c : max. H. as preserved 1 -5 cm ; max. W. as preserved 2-25 cm. The max. Th. of these items is 0-2 cm. Special Features : Together the fragments indicate that the plaque was, when complete, curved about its vertical axis (as defined by its painted decoration). For restored section, see Plate Illa. Painting executed on concave surface. Design : Plates Ila and Ilia. Taken together, the fragments show a beardless, bare-footed, four- winged male figure facing to the right with hands upraised in the Egyptian gesture of reverent adora- tion. As far as may be discerned, he is wearing garments of a kind often worn by male figures of Egyptian appearance on the Nimrud ivories (see p. 5, n. 18). Portions of these garments are visible at the base of the figure's forearms (Fragment a), on his right shoulder (Fragment b), and behind and between his legs (Fragment c). On his head he wears what from its clearly preserved brow-band appears to be, not a wig, but an Egyptian nemes head-dress surmounted by a disc. While the figure's upper pair of wings is very largely preserved (Fragments a and b), his lower pair is perhaps not so easily to be made out. The base of one of these wings is to be seen below the figure's left forearm (Fragment a), while the tip of the other appears close behind the calf of his right leg (Fragment c). The background against which the figure stands shows the plain curving stems of a shrub or plant (Fragments a and b), which springs from the ground behind his right heel (Fragment c). The four- winged figure and his accompanying plant are enclosed by a rectangular fine-line frame. Paints : Both the four-winged figure and the plant are delicately delineated in black paint. Clear traces of blue paint are preserved on three flight-feathers of the figure's upper left wing (Fragment a) and on an uncertainly identifiable element (portion of lower right wing?) below his right shoulder (Fragment b). For the exact position and extent of these blue traces, see Plate Ilia, where they are indicated in solid black. Remarks : While the Nimrud Expedition Field Catalogue for 1958 simply records that these three fragments came from FS. Room S.W.7, an Expedition label preserved with them in the Iraq Museum, Baghdad, bears in Dr. Joan Oates' handwriting the pencilled note : " glass frags., S.W.7, with ivory ".</page><page sequence="22">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD 19 ND. 7,633 : British School of Archaeology in Iraq, London. Object : Top half of a small, apparently rectangular plaque with painted decoration. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque off-white due to advanced decomposition. Spotted with soil accretions. Despite decomposition former glass clearly bubbly. Surface flakings exhibit a light silvery iridescence shot with pale pink and green. Dimensions : max. H. as preserved 2-7 cm ; W. 4-0 cm ; max. Th. 0-2 cm. Special Features : The plaque is curved about its vertical axis (as defined by its painted decoration). For section, see Plate lllb. Painting executed on concave surface. Design : Plates la, lib and lllb. The fragment shows the upper half of a beardless, four (?)-winged male figure facing left, his hands upraised in the same gesture of adoration as those of the four-winged figure on plaque ND. 7,632 described above. From what little is preserved of his clothing, viz. the wide, half-length sleeves of a tunic, both he and the figure on ND. 7,632 seem to have been identically dressed. On his head he wears an Egyptian nemes head-dress surmounted by a disc with two flanking uraei. Assuming that the figure originally had four wings like the figure on ND. 7,632, the lower pair has been completely broken away (along with the lower half of his body), leaving only the upper pair extant. The figure, who seems to be standing against a plain background, is enclosed by a rectangular fine-line frame. Paints : The winged figure is delicately delineated in black paint. Clear traces of blue paint are visible on three flight-feathers of his left wing and on part of its covert-feather area. Another large patch of blue is preserved immediately behind his left hand. For the exact position and extent of these blue traces, see Plate lllb, where they are indicated in solid black. ND. 7,638: British Museum, Dept. of Western Asiatic Antiquities. No. 134900 (1966-12-17,8) Object : A small rectangular plaque with painted decoration. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque off-white due to advanced decomposition. Spotted with soil accretions. Dimensions : H. 3 ? 5 cm ; W. 4 ? 2 cm ; max. Th. o ? 2 cm. Special Features : The plaque is curved about its vertical axis (as defined by its painted decoration). For section see Plate I IL?. Painting executed on concave surface. Design : Plates le, IL? and IIL?. The plaque shows a human-headed, winged sphinx advancing left towards a tall, straight-stemmed lily, its tufted leonine tail held loosely erect. From its chest hangs a uraeus crowned with a disc. The sphinx is arrayed in a two-strand collar and an apron with two transverse bands decorating the hem. On its head is what appears to be an Egyptian nemes head-dress surmounted by a disc and uraeus. The sphinx with its accompanying lily is enclosed by a rectangular fine-line frame. Paints : Both the sphinx and the lily are delicately delineated in black paint. Clear traces of blue paint are visible (a) on the body of the uraeus which hangs from the sphinx's chest, (b) on the lower decorative band of the sphinx's apron, and (c) on two flight-feathers of the sphinx's left wing. For the exact position and extent of these blue traces, see Plate IIL?, where they are indicated in solid black. ND. 7,639 : Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Unregistered. Object : A small rectangular plaque with painted decoration. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque off-white due to advanced decomposition. Spotted with soil accretions. Despite decomposition former glass clearly bubbly. Detached flakes exhibit a greenish-golden iridescence. Dimensions : H. 3-2 cm ; W. 4*4 cm, max. Th. 0*2 cm. Special Features : The plaque is curved about its vertical axis (as defined by its painted decoration). For section, see Plate llld. Painting executed on concave surface. Design : Plates lid, llld, and Fig. 1 a-d. The plaque shows a human-headed, winged sphinx advancing right towards a tall, straight-stemmed lily, its tufted leonine tail held loosely erect. In front of the sphinx's chest is a disc, the crown of a pendent uraeus (see ND. 7,638 above) which is now completely obliterated save for slight traces of its body against the sphinx's advanced left foreleg.

On its head is an Egyptian nemes head-dress surmounted by a disc and uraeus. The sphinx and its accompanying lily are enclosed by a rectangular fine-line frame. Paints : Both the sphinx and the lily are delicately delineated in black paint. Clear traces of blue paint are visible (a) on the sphinx's nemes head-dress and two-strand collar, (b) on five flight-feathers of its right wing, (c) on the disc belonging to the uraeus formerly pendent from its chest, and (d) on the left petal (as viewed) of the lily. For the exact position and extent of these blue traces, see Plate llld, where they are indicated in solid black. Remarks: In listing ND. 7,639 as coming from Room S.W.7, F?rt Shalmaneser, the Nimrud Expedition Field Catalogue for 1958 records that it was " found in lower fill with ivories ". This identically-worded information is repeated in Dr. Joan Oates' handwriting on an Expedition label currently preserved with the plaque in the Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Part 11 : The Room S. W. 37 Group of Miniature Painted Glass Plaques (found during ig6i Nimrud season) ND. 10,279 a : British School of Archaeology in Iraq. Temporarily mislaid. Object : A small, rectangular plaque with painted decoration : incomplete (?). Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless like plaques ND. 10,279 b and ND. 10,280 a and b described below, but now opaque buff due to advanced decomposition. Dimensions : max. H. as preserved (?) 4-0 cm ; W. 30 cm ; Th. c. 0-2 cm. Special Features : Flat in section. Design : A Sacred Tree. According to the recollection of the writer who provided the entry on this piece in the Nimrud Expedition Field Catalogue for 1961, the Tree was of the same type and descrip- tion as that vestigially preserved on plaque ND. 10,280 a below (i.e., with flowers, buds and voluted branches symmetrically disposed on either side of the trunk). For the type in ivorywork, see Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, Fig. 508. Paint : The Sacred Tree is delicately delineated in black. Remarks : The height and width of this item are taken from the Nimrud Expedition Field Cata- logue for 1961. Although the thickness of the plaque is not recorded in that source, it was closely similar to that given below for plaques ND. 10,279 k an(l ND 10,280 a, i.e. between 0*20 and 0-25 cm. ND. 10,279 b : The Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, N.Y. Object : Fragment of a small, apparently wing-shaped plaque with painted decoration. Material: Glass; originally transparent, colourless and bubbly (see Brill, Part II, p. 27), but now opaque buff due to advanced decomposition. Dimensions : max. H. 2 -7 cm ; max. W. as preserved 4-0 cm ; Th. 0-25 cm. Special Features : Flat in section (see Brill, Part II, p. 25). Design : Now generally obscured due to disintegration of weathered obverse, see Plate llg. Accord- ing to the recollection of the writer who provided the entry for this item in the Nimrud Expedition Field Catalogue for 1961, it bore what appeared to be a number of radiating wing feathers (for con- firmation of this from an independent source, see von Saldern, apud Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, 632 (Section II A, 4) and in Glass and Glassmaking, 223 (35 d)). Paint : Wing feathers (?) delicately delineated in black paint. ND. 10,280 a : Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Unregistered. Object : Bottom half of a small, apparently rectangular plaque with painted decoration. The piece is now mounted on two thicknesses of bandage material with a clear adhesive. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque buff due to advanced decom- position. Where exposed, inner layers of weathering products exhibit a light golden iridescence shot with pale pink and green. Vestiges of numerous bubbles visible. Dimensions : max. H. as preserved 3 -o cm ; W. 4*0 cm ; max. Th. 0-2 cm. Special Features : Flat in section ; see Plate III/?. Design : Plates ??? and ????. Faintly and only very incompletely visible is the lower half of a Sacred Tree of the kind with paired upward-curving, voluted branches and symmetrically arranged</page><page sequence="24">SOME MINIATURE PAINTED GLASS PLAQUES FROM FORT SHALMANESER, NIMRUD 2 I flowers and buds springing both from the trunk and from the voluted branch tips (for the general type, see Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, Fig. 508). The top of the tree is missing with the upper half of the plaque. Paint : The Sacred Tree is delicately delineated in black paint. ND. 10,280 b : Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Unregistered Object : Bottom half of a small and probably once rectangular plaque with painted decoration. The piece is now mounted on two thicknesses of bandage material with a clear adhesive. Material : Glass ; originally transparent, colourless, but now opaque buff due to advanced decom- position. The reverse of this weathered fragment has flaked away to such an extent that it now re- sembles scarcely more than a skin of corrosion, grotesquely distorted by the contractions of the backing on which it has been mounted. The inner remaining layers of weathering products exhibit a light golden iridescence shot with pale pink and green and vestiges of numerous bubbles are visible. Dimensions : max. H. as preserved 3*3 cm ; max. W. as preserved 3-7 cm ; max. Th. as preserved 0-07 cm. Special Features : Originally flat in section. Design : Plates 11/and III/. The fragment shows the lower half of a two-winged anthropomorphic figure facing to the right in a protective pose reminiscent of such Egyptian goddesses as Isis and Nephthys. The figure wears a long, ankle-length garment opened in front so as to leave his/her advanced left leg exposed. The figure's right wing, the only one preserved, rests on a papyrus blossom, the stem of which, now missing, must formerly have trailed along the ground from the right hand corner of the plaque. The figure's head, shoulders and upraised left wing are missing with the upper half of the plaque. For similar two-winged figures in ivory with long garments draped in the manner represented here, see Mallowan, ? &amp; R II, Figs. 482 (a pair of female figures) and 495 (a single male figure). Paint : The winged figure is delicately delineated in black paint.</page></plain_text>
