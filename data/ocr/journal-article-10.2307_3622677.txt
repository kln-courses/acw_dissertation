<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETING THE BIBLE BY WARREN ZEV HARVEY I In the Introduction to The Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides explains that the key to understanding the Bible is to realize that the prophets spoke in metaphors and similitudes - the lan- guage of dream and vision, of imagination. His opening proof- text is Hosea 12:11: "And by the ministry of the prophets I have used similitudes."' The full verse is: "I have spoken by the prophets, I have multiplied visions, and by the ministry of the prophets I have used similitudes." The Hebrew underlying "I have used similitudes" is simply the one word adammeh, which in a different context could be translated: I have imagined. In the Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 1, Article 9, Aquinas asks whether Holy Scripture should use metaphors. As is his fashion, he gives some objections: metaphors are unscien- tific; cloud the issue; conceal not reveal; are improper for describing holy subjects. But then, in his Sed Contra, he cites The Guide of the Perplexed, trans. S. Pines, Chicago, 1963, pp. 10-11. In quotations from the Guide, the Pines translation will sometimes be modified, usually to conform to the anonymous Latin translation (made from the Hebrew translation of Judah Alharizi), Dux Neutrorum seu Dubiorum (Paris, 1520; photoedition, Frankfurt, 1964), apparently used by Aquinas. In some cases, terms from the Guide will be given also in Maimonides' Arabic (ed. Munk-Joel, Jerusalem, 1930-1931), Alharizi's Hebrew (ed. Scheyer-Munk, Jerusalem, 1952-1953) and the Latin of the Dux Neutrorum. The chapter numbers in the Dux Neutrorum (which generally follow Alharizi) sometimes vary from the standard numbering found in Pines, and variances will be noted in brackets.</page><page sequence="2">60 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [2] Hosea 12:11: "I have multiplied visions, and by the ministry of the prophets I have used similitudes."2 The Bible uses parable and metaphor - non-literal speech, figurative speech, imaginative speech. Aquinas agrees with Maimonides on this, and also agrees with him to a great extent with regard to the general issue of how one ought to interpret the Bible. As we shall see, however, the two thinkers also have significant differences on this issue. II Not only does Aquinas agree with Maimonides about Hosea 12:11, but he follows him in ranking the prophets in accordance with the clarity of their imaginations. Maimonides' exposition of the "grades of prophecy" (Arabic: maratib al-nubuwah; Hebrew: ma'alot ha-nebuah; Latin: gradus prophetiae) is found in Guide, II, 45. Aquinas, borrowing Maimonides' phrase, exposits on the gradus prophetiae in the Summa Theologiae, Part II, 2, Question 174, Article 3.3 The first two grades of prophecy, according to Maimonides, are in the strict sense not prophecy at all. Rather, as he puts it, "the first and second grades are stepping stones toward proph- ecy, and someone who has attained one of them is not to be considered a prophet.... And even though he may sometimes be called a prophet, this term is applied to him in a general sort of way because he is very close to the prophets."4 Among the examples given by Maimonides to illustrate the first and lowest grade of prophecy are the Judges of Israel. He quotes inter alia a text concerning Samson: "And the spirit of the Lord came upon him" (Judges 14:18). This first grade, he explains, is one in 2 Citations of the Summa Theologiae will be based on the Latin-English Blackfriars edition (London &amp; New York, 1964-1976), but the Blackfriars translation will not always be followed. 3The dependence of Aquinas' exposition on Maimonides' is discussed in Adalbert Merx, Die Prophetie des Joel (Halle, 1879), pp. 354-357; and now in Avital Wohlman, Thomas d'Aquin et Maimonide (Paris, 1988), pp. 287-297. 4 P. 395.</page><page sequence="3">[3] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION which "an individual receives a divine help that moves and activates him to a great, righteous, and important action."5 Among the examples given by Maimonides to illustrate the second grade of prophecy is the Book of Proverbs of Solomon. This second grade, Maimonides explains, is one in which a force comes upon an individual "so that he talks in wise sayings" and the like.6 Following Maimonides, Aquinas also recognizes two grades of prophecy which are "below prophecy properly speaking." As his example of the first and lowest grade of prophecy, he gives, after Maimonides, the case of Samson, citing the text: "The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him," etc. (Judges 15:14). Again following Maimonides, Aquinas defines this lowest grade of prophecy as one in which an individual "is moved by an interior instinct to an exterior action." As his example of the second grade of prophecy, Aquinas, again after Maimonides, gives the Proverbs of Solomon. This grade, writes Aquinas, still following Maimonides, occurs when an individual is enlight- ened ... to some knowledge." Aquinas thus follows Maimonides quite closely in defining the first two grades of "prophecy," which in point of fact are not strictly speaking prophecy. He follows him closely also with regard to those prophets who are strictly speaking prophets. In grading the prophets who are strictly speaking prophets, Maimonides does not state explicitly how many criteria he is using; however, two general criteria are clear. The first is whether the prophecy occurs in a dream (Hebrew: halom; Latin: somnium) or in a vision (Hebrew: mar'ah; Latin: visio)7: the third through the seventh grades are dreams; the eighth through the eleventh - or twelfth, if there is a twelfth - are visions. The second criterion is the nature of what is imagined P. 396. 6 P. 398. 7 The biblical Hebrew terms halom and mar'ah (see Numbers 12:6) are used in Maimonides' Arabic text. 61</page><page sequence="4">62 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [4] in the dream or the vision: perceiving a parable is lowest; higher is hearing anonymous speech; still higher is being addressed by a human being; even higher, being addressed by an angel; highest, being addressed by God, e.g., Isaiah 6:1.8 Aquinas states explicitly that there are four criteria for grad- ing the prophets who are strictly speaking prophets. His first criterion is Maimonides' distinction between somnium and visio. His remaining criteria concern the nature of what is imagined, and all may be distilled from Maimonides' dis- cussion: hearing words is higher than perceiving parables; being addressed is higher than merely hearing or seeing; being addressed by an angel is higher than being addressed by a human being, and the highest is being addressed by God, e.g., Isaiah 6:1.9 After grading the prophets in accordance with the clarity of their imagination, Maimonides reminds us of his doctrine that there exists a higher rank of prophecy, which is called "proph- ecy" only amphibolously, and this is the prophecy of Moses, which was wholly intellectual, that is, not through the inter- mediary of the imaginative faculty. 1 Aquinas, after grading the 8 In addition to Guide, II, 45, pp. 395-403, see also II, 43-44 [44], pp. 391- 395. Cf. the parallel text in Mishneh Torah, Yesode ha-Torah 7:2-3. 9 Aquinas follows Maimonides not only in citing Isaiah 6:1 as an example of a prophet being addressed by God, but also in citing Jeremiah 1:13 as an example of a prophet perceiving a parable; cf. Guide, II, 43 [44], p. 392. '0 Pp. 402-403. Cf. II, 35 [36], p. 367: "the term prophet is used with reference to Moses and the others amphibolously" (Arabic: bi-tashkik; Hebrew: be-safeq; Latin: aequi voce). Aequi voce is a passable but not precise rendering of bi-tashkik or be-safeq. Isaac Abrabanel, in his early sixteenth century Commen- tary on the Guide (in More Nebukhim, Warsaw, 1871-1872), II, 35, p. 74a, attests that some texts of the Guide (presumably of the Samuel ibn Tibbon Hebrew translation used by him) read be-shittuf ("equivocally"). The Latin translator may have had be-shittuf in his Alharizi, or collated an Ibn Tibbon translation which read be-shittuf, or collated an Arabic text which conceivably read bi-ishtirak ("equivocally"). In the same sentence from Guide, II, 35 [36], the Latin translation is in one detail faithful to the Arabic (and Ibn Tibbon), but not to Alharizi, who inserts the word be-emet ("in truth"), and reads: "the term</page><page sequence="5">[5] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION prophets in accordance with the clarity of their imagination, similarly remarks that there is a "genus of prophecy" in which "truth is shown without the vision of the imagination," and this is the genus of Moses' prophecy."I It may be noted that in agreeing with Maimonides that purely intellectual prophecy is of a higher genus than prophecy which employs the imagina- tion, Aquinas was taking a position contra Augustine.'2 Aquinas thus follows Maimonides on the issue of prophecy and the imagination. However, there is a critical difference between Maimonides and Aquinas on this issue. Maimonides describes prophecy as being a natural phenomenon. Aquinas repeats again and again throughout Question 174 that prophecy involves supernatural knowledge, that is, knowledge of veritas prophet is used with reference to Moses in truth, and to the others amphibol- ously." Cf. below, notes 20 and 35. " Given Christian traditions about the superiority of David's prophecy, Aquinas concludes that David, as well as Moses, achieved revelation absque imaginaria visione (Article 4, ad 1). Maimonides, by contrast, relegates David to the lowly second grade (Guide, II, 45, pp. 398-400). Aquinas further differs from Maimonides in stating that New Testament figures, e.g., John the Baptist, are to be preferred even to Moses (Article 4, ad 3). In establishing the intellectual nature of Moses' knowledge of God, Aquinas cites Numbers 12:8 ("manifestly and not in riddles, he doth behold ... the Lord"), a verse used in Guide, II, 45, pp. 402-403, for this purpose (cf. Mishneh Torah, Yesode ha- Torah 7:6); the verse distinguishes Moses from the prophets of "dream" and "vision" mentioned in Numbers 12:6. Aquinas, however, makes a point of stating that Moses also had outstanding imaginative vision, and while awake he saw God addressing him, "as a man speaketh unto his friend" (Exodus 33:11) (Article 4, ad 2). Although this statement does not accord with Maimonides' overt position in II, 45, according to which the prophecy of Moses is wholly intellectual, it might be thought to accord with his covert position. Maimonides asks whether it is possible for a prophet to see God addressing him in a vision of prophecy, and answers that it is "improbable" (p. 402); he then goes on to state that God spoke with Moses "as a man speaketh unto his friend" (p. 403). Aquinas in effect answers Maimonides' question affirmatively, and uses a verse cited by Maimonides as proof. It is not clear if Aquinas thought he was following Maimonides' esoteric doctrine, or if he thought he was simply diverging from him. 12 See Article 2, objection 1, and the response ad 1. 63</page><page sequence="6">64 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [6] supernaturalis.'3 A prophet, teaches Maimonides, becomes a prophet only by acquiring the excellences requisite for proph- ecy. It is, he argues, no more possible for God to turn an ignoramus into a prophet than for Him to turn an ass or a frog into one.14 Aquinas, however, cites the cases of David and Amos to prove that God can turn anyone into a prophet, even a young harp player or a cowboy and dresser of sycamore trees.'5 Aquinas' attitude toward Maimonides on the issue of proph- ecy and the imagination is typical of his general attitude toward him. He accepts the fundamentals and the framework of Mai- monides' analysis, but assimilating it into his own system, he tames its zealous intellectualism, and transforms the spirit of Maimonideanism into the spirit of Thomism.'6 III Aquinas agrees with Maimonides that the prophets spoke in the figurative language of the imagination, and agrees with him that 13 See Alexander Altmann, "Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas: Natural or Divine Prophecy," AJS Review, 3 (1979), 1-19; reprinted in Altmann, Essays in Jewish Intellectual History (Hanover, N.H., 1981), pp. 77-96. Cf. "It is remarkable that Thomas Aquinas could adopt a great many point' from Maimonides' theory of prophecy, notwithstanding the radical difference in their fundamental outlook, which may be summed up in the antithesis between 'natural' and 'divine' prophecy" (p. 7; Essays, p. 81); "The essential difference between Maimonides and Thomas is ... the difference between natural and divine prophecy" (pp. 16-17; Essays, p. 89).

However, Mai- monides goes too far for him. Aquinas will see literal meaning in texts which Maimonides explains as figurative. Maimonides' bold non-literalist interpretations will strike Aquinas as break- ing all ties with the biblical text. Aquinas, it seems evident, senses a nihilism in Maimonides' approach to the Bible: any- thing is possible; nothing is necessarily what it says it is; if the Bible says A, it might mean A, but it just as well might mean B or C or D, when B, C and D are contradictories of A. The Bible, Aquinas thinks, does indeed use figurative speech, but not as often - and not in such a radical way - as Maimonides teaches. Let us look at the way Maimonides and Aquinas respectively approach biblical language concerning God and the angels. IV We shall begin with God. Maimonides' teaching on language describing God is simple, straightforward, stark. Nothing can be literally predicated of God. Every adjective the Bible uses to describe God is figura- tive. This is Maimonides' celebrated, uncompromising via negativa. You may say what God is not, but not what He is. According to the via negativa, God is not a body, nor is He "compassionate" or "merciful," for compassion and mercy are passions of the body.17 Similarly, God is not "alive" or "power- ful" or "wise" or "willing," for these too are attributes of finite creatures.'8 Moreover, even the statement "God is One" is figurative; for God is not One is the sense that any created being is one; which is to say, He is not literally "one."'9 Even "God exists" is not to be taken literally, for "exists" means to be in creation. The term "exists," like any other term predicated of 17 Guide, I, 52 [51], p. 116; 54 [53], pp. 124-125. 18 Guide, I, 53 [52], pp. 121-122; 56 [55], pp. 130-131; 58 [57], p. 136. 19 Guide, I, 57 [56], pp. 132-133; 58 [57], p. 136. 65</page><page sequence="8">66 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [8] God, is applied to Him and to created beings in "a purely equivocal sense" (Arabic: bi-ishtirak mahd; Hebrew: be-shittuf amitti; Latin: aequivoce vere, aequivoce pure).20 In short, all adjectives applied to God are figurative, and the only true praise of God is silence.21 If one is to speak literally, he can do no more than to say what God is not. He is not a chair, not a table, not a body, not a force in a body, etc. Ultimately, God is not the created universe.22 However, negation gives us no knowledge whatsoever of the negated subject per se.23 Aquinas explicitly rejects Maimonides' via negativa in the Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 13. He rejects it, although he is strongly attracted to it, and although he holds with Maimonides that we can have no knowledge of God's essence.24 20 Guide, I, 56 [55], pp. 130-131; cf. 35 [34], p. 80; 52 [51], p. 117; 57 [56], p. 132; 60 [59], p. 144. In the passage from I, 56 [55], the phrase "purely equivocally" (Arabic: bi-ishtirdk mahd) appears twice. Alharizi has twice: be-shittufamitti. The Latin has once aequivoce vere (with Alharizi) and once aequivoce pure (with the Arabic); the latter rendering led Wolfson to suggest that the Latin translator may have made some use of the original (H.A. Wolfson, "St. Thomas on Divine Attributes," Melanges offerts d Etienne Gilson [Toronto, 1959], p. 690; photoreprinted in J.I. Dienstag, Studies in Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas [New York, 1975]; and Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, II [Cambridge, Mass., 1977], 514).

Kaplan (Philadelphia, 1983), pp. 11-13. 23 Guide, I, 59 [58], p. 139: "negation does not give knowledge in any respect of the true reality of the thing with regard to which the particular matter in question has been negated." 24 See Article 2, ad 3.

See also Josef Pieper, The Silence of St. Thomas (New York, 1957). Moreover, Aquinas argues in Article 2 that names, albeit imperfectly, "signify the divine substance" (divinam substan- tiam significant); yet he states in De Potentia, Question 7, Article 3, ad 4, that "God is not in the genus of substance, but is above all substance" (Deus non est in genere substantiae, sed est supra omnem substantiam). See Gilson, "Quasi Definitio Substantiae," in St. Thomas Aquinas, 1274-1974, Commemorative</page><page sequence="9">[9] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION 67 In Article 5, which treats of the question of whether names can be predicated of God univocally, he defines his own position. With Maimonides, he holds that it is impossible that names be predicated of God univocally; but against Maimonides, he holds that names are not predicated of God "purely equivo- cally" (pure aequivoce).25 Rather, he contends, they are predi- cated of Him "analogously," imperfectly: there is at least some small area in common between the meaning of a name predi- cated of God and the meaning of the same name when predi- cated of a created thing. Aquinas' position is in general the same as that of Avicenna, Averroes, and all the philosophers in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition, save Maimonides. They held that attributes are predicated of God neither univocally nor equivo- cally, but "amphibolously." Maimonides, refusing in any way to compromise the via negativa, emphatically rejected the doc- trine that divine attributes are "amphibolous" (Arabic: bi- tashkfk; Hebrew: be-safeq; Latin: ambigua vel per transsump- tionem).26 Studies, Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, Toronto, 1974, pp. 111-129. I. Franck's suggestion that Aquinas may have esoterically espoused a strict via negativa is not absurd ("Maimonides and Aquinas," Review of Metaphysics, 38 [1985], 613). D.B. Burrell's imaginative dialogue between Maimonides and Aquinas ("Aquinas and Maimonides: A Conversation about Proper Speech," Immanuel, 16 [1983], 70-85) underestimates both the radicalism of Mai- monides' via negativa and the allure this radical via negativa had for Aquinas; cf. Burrell's Knowing the Unknowable God (Notre Dame, 1986); and his "Aquinas' Debt to Maimonides," in R. Link-Salinger, et al., A Straight Path: Essays in Honor of Arthur Hyman (Washington, D.C., 1987), pp. 38-41. 25 The use of the expression pure aequivoce indicates that Aquinas has in mind Guide, I, 56 [55]; see above, note 20; cf. Wolfson, "St. Thomas," p. 690 (Studies, II, p. 514). In breaking here with Maimonidean intellectualism, Aquinas prefers Augustine, whose authority is cited in the Sed Contra and in the corpus; cf. below, note 41. 26 Guide, 1, 56 [55], p. 131; see above, notes 10 and 20. The generalization about "all" Arabic Aristotelians is Wolfson's, and based on his masterful series of studies on divine attributes in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophers. These studies are collected in his Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, I (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), vol. II (above, note 20). Wolfson writes:</page><page sequence="10">68 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [10] In Article 2, Aquinas spells out his criticism of Maimonides' position. His criticism is short, to the point, and justly famous. The topic of Article 2 is "whether any name can be applied to God substantialiter." Is there any adjective which literally expresses something of God's substance? In the course of his response to this question, Aquinas considers Maimonides' via negativa, presenting it as follows: As regards names of God said absolutely and affirmatively, as "good," "wise," and the like, various opinions have been held. Some have said that all such names, although they are applied to God affirmatively, nevertheless are being used to negate something of God. Hence, they assert that when we say "God lives," we mean God is not an inanimate thing; and so on regarding other names. This was taught by Rabbi Moses. "Maimonides, I make bold to say, was the first, and the only one, who knowingly set out to interpret divine attibutes ... 'in a purely equivocal sense.' ... All the Arabic philosophers interpret divine attributes as ambiguous terms, which ... is the same as analogical terms. ... The only one in the history of philosophy who openly rejected 'analogy,' under the guise of 'ambiguity,' as an interpretation of divine attributes is Maimonides" ("St. Thomas," pp. 690, 698 [Studies, II, pp. 514, 522]). "No other philosopher before [Maimonides], whether writing in Greek or Latin or Arabic or Hebrew, has explicitly inter- preted divine attributes as equivocal terms" ("Maimonides and Gersonides on Divine Attributes as Ambiguous Terms," Mordecai M. Kaplan Jubilee Volume [New York, 1953], p. 515; also in Studies, vol. II, p. 231). Wolfson's bold assertions appear true with regard to the Aristotelian tradition, but may need modification regarding other traditions. In any case, Maimonides' strict via negativa seems to have been adumbrated by the Isma'ili theologian, Hamid al- Din al-Kirmani (see S. Pines, "Shi'ite Terms and Concepts in Judah Halevi's Kuzari," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, 2 [1980], 241-243). Wolfson's identification of analogy with amphibolousness or ambiguity is controversial, as there are basic differences between Aquinas' theory of analogy and the theories of amphibolousness generally held by the Arabic philosophers. S. Pines, for example, has remarked to me that Aquinas' Fourth Way (Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 2, Article 3) commits him to a theory of attributes significantly closer to univocality than is amphibolousness. In a broad sense, however, there are three positions: univocal predication, equivocal predication, and something in between.</page><page sequence="11">[11] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION Aquinas is referring here to Maimonides' statement in Guide, I, 58 [57], according to which the statement "God is living" is to be understood as meaning that He is not inanimate or dead.27 Having thus presented Maimonides' via negativa, Aquinas goes on to reject it on three counts: First, because ... a reason cannot be given why some names more than others should be applied to God. ... So to say that He is a body implies that He is not a mere potentiality, like prime matter.... Second, because it would follow that all names applied to God would be said of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense.... Third, because this is against the intention of those who speak of God [contra intentionem loquentium de Deo]. For in saying that "God lives" they surely mean more than to say that ... He differs from inanimate bodies! There are two popular misconceptions about Aquinas' criticism here of Maimonides. One is that Aquinas did not really under- stand Maimonides' position. In point of fact, he understood it well. He understood that according to Maimonides' position there is absolutely nothing which in truth can be predicated of God substantialiter. The second popular misconception is that Aquinas' criticism concerns a minor point, a nuance, and that he basically agrees with Maimonides. In point of fact, there is a momentous difference between Maimonides' position and Aquinas'. It is the difference between nothing and something. Maimonides says that nothing can be predicated of God sub- stantialiter, Aquinas says that something can. Let us now allow ourselves full rein to speculate how Mai- monides might respond to Aquinas' threefold criticism of his via negativa. First, Maimonides would agree that from an epistemological point of view there is indeed no difference between any nega- tions: none tells us anything about the divine essence.28 How- 27 P. 135. 28 "All passages in the Scriptures in which it is predicated of Him, may He be 69</page><page sequence="12">70 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [12] ever, there certainly are heuristic differences between nega- tions, and the question of why some words are to be preferred to others as predicates of God must be answered on heuristic grounds. The via negativa is valuable not because it gives knowledge about God, for it does not; rather, it is valuable as a pedagogic tool, useful for rooting out our superstitious and vulgar notions about God, and ultimately for impressing upon us that creation is not Creator. Maimonides is fond of quoting the Rabbinic dictum, "The Torah speaks in accordance with the language of human beings" (BT Berakhot 31b, et al.); and he understands this dictum as teaching that the Bible speaks in accordance with the imagination of its audience (see Guide, I, 26).29 If the via negativa is taken seriously as a pedagogical tool, it would follow that to those who imagine that God is a body, we should say He is incorporeal, and to those who imagine that He is a mere potentiality, we should indeed say He is a body.30 In the biblical period, the multitude may have considered God to be in effect "a mere potentiality," and if so, this would account for why the prophets chose to ascribe to God corporeal attributes ("the hand of the Lord," "the eyes of the Lord," etc.). In the 12th century, during the heydays of the Age of Faith, the multitude had a vivid but anthropomorphic belief in God, and it is thus understandable that theologians and philosophers in those days exalted, that He is 'the First and the Last' are like those in which it is predicated of Him that He has an eye or an ear" (I, 57 [56], p. 133). To be sure, it requires more intellectual ability to understand that God is not 'the First and the Last' than to understand that He has no eyes or ears, and in this one sense there are epistemological differences between negations. Similarily, Einstein was in a position to negate more of God than Maimonides could, since he knew more about the physical universe than did Maimonides. Nonetheless, no negations give any knowledge of God per se; and neither Maimonides nor Einstein could have known anything of God per se. 29 P. 56 (Arabic: al-khayal al-jumhuri; Hebrew mahashebet he-hamon; Latin: cogitationes gentium). The negative attributes, writes Maimonides, "conduct the mind" toward correct beliefs with regard to God (I, 58 [57], p. 135). 30 "The minds [of the multitude] were conducted to the belief that He exists by imagining that He is corporeal" (Guide, I, 46 [45], p. 98); cf. previous note.</page><page sequence="13">[ 13] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION insisted that God be spoken of as incorporeal. In our own secular age, when God is considered by the majority to be not even "a mere potentiality," theologians and philosophers no longer disquisit on God's incorporeality, but prefer to speak of Him in existential, anthropopathic, and sometimes downright anthropomorphic terms, so much so that moder theological language is arguably closer to that of the biblical prophets than to that of the medieval scholastics. In short, according to Maimonides, the difference between negations is a difference regarding the knower, not the Unknowable object of his knowl- edge. Maimonides is saying plainly that we can predicate nothing of God substantialiter. Everything we say - and everything the Bible says - about God is said in order to educate people by disburdening them of their false imaginings. In sum, while from an epistemological point of view there is no difference between negations, from the heuristic point of view there are important differences. Second, Maimonides would agree that all names are predi- cated of God in a secondary sense. He states explicitly that all names of God are derivative except for the Tetragrammaton.31 As for the Tetragrammaton, it is understood by him as indicat- ing necessary existence, but necessary existence cannot be conceived by us in any way except as not being "possible existence."32 Third, Maimonides would agree that his position is not in accordance with what most people mean when they talk about God. However, he would add, the multitude have many funda- mentally wrong notions about God, and ought to be taught to reject them, and that in fact is what the via negativa aims to do. Aquinas' criticism of Maimonides' position thus focuses on real points of difference between them. However, it is also true 31 Guide, I, 61 [60], p. 147. 32 I, 61-64 [60-63]; n.b. "Perhaps it indicates the notion of a necessary existence," etc. (61 [60], p. 148). Cf.

Aqui- nas is convinced by Maimonides' arguments that the Bible does not speak of God univocally, but he cannot accept that its speech is purely equivocal. He cannot, that is, accept Maimo- nides' unbending position according to which the word "lives" when applied to God has nothing but a name in common with the word "lives" when applied to a human being or an animal. Aquinas' via analogiae is a compromise: predication is neither univocal nor equivocal. The word "lives" does not mean the same thing when applied to man and God, but neither is there absolutely nothing in common between the two applications. When applied to God, our language is deficient, imperfect, but there is something which is predicated substantialter, even if that something is very very slim and fragile. And something is not nothing. Logicians may have trouble making sense out of Aquinas' hybrid "way of analogy."33 But theologians have loved it. Even most Jewish thinkers followed here Avicenna, Averroes, and Aquinas, rather than Maimonides. Gersonides, the foremost Maimonidean philosopher after Maimonides, did so; and so did Hasdai Crescas, the foremost anti-Maimonidean.34 The logic of Maimonides' position is overwhelming, but how many religious souls can be satisfied with an uncompromising via negativa? Most will agree with Aquinas in protesting that this kind of nihilistic interpretation is not what the Bible means. So much for God. 33 "[A]ll analogical theories are illogical theories; there is no middle ground between univocity and equivocity" (Fred Sommers, "What We Can Say About God," Judaism, 15 [1966], 65). Cf. J.F. Ross' valiant attempt to make logical sense of the theory of analogy, and his uneasy conclusion that it has "substantial defects," but is necessary if traditional statements about God are to be "both literally meaningful and true" ("Analogy as a Rule of Meaning for Religious Language," in Aquinas, ed. Anthony Kenny [New York, 1969], p. 138); and cf. Ross' Portraying Analogy, Cambridge, 1981, pp. 164-165. 34 See Wolfson, "Maimonides and Gersonides" (above, note 26), pp. 411-</page><page sequence="15">[ 15] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION V Now to angels. In Guide, II, 6 [7], Maimonides explains that the Hebrew word for angel (mal'akh) means "messenger," and that the word is commonly used to refer to the separate intellects and to physical forces. Regarding angels as separate intellects, Mai- monides remarks that there is no difference between Aristotle and the Bible except "in terms, for he speaks of separate intellects and we speak of angels."35 Regarding angels as physi- cal forces, Maimonides makes the following colorful obser- vation: If you told one of the ignorant pietists that God sends an angel, who enters the womb of a woman and forms the fetus there, he would deem this a manifestation of God's greatness and power, and imagine the angel to be an enormous fiery being; but if you told him that the angel is the formative force in the sperm, he would shrink from this opinion, not realizing that God's true greatness and power are in His bringing into exis- tence physical forces.36 Aquinas, as we should expect, is not happy with Maimonides' naturalistic doctrine of angels. In Summa Theologiae, Part I, Article 50, Question 3, he rejects Maimonides' doctrine, stating unequivocally: "It is alien to the custom of Scripture [alienum a consuetudine Scripturae] for the forces of irrational things to be called angels." Angels, Aquinas insists, are rational spiritual beings, not forces of nature. Curiously, Maimonides and Aquinas quote the same proof- text in order to prove respectively that angels are and are not 446 (Studies, II, pp. 231-246); "Crescas on the Problem of Divine Attributes," Jewish Quarterly Review, 7 (1916), 1-44, 175-221 (Studies, I, pp. 247-337). 35 P. 262. Alharizi systematically translates the Arabic 'uqul mufdrika by the Hebrew kohot maskilot nibdalot; but the Latin follows the Arabic, translating intelligentiae absractae or separatae, or intellectus abstractos or separatos. This is further evidence that the Latin translator collated the Arabic original or the Ibn Tibbon translation; see above, notes 10 and 20. 36 Pp. 263-264. 73</page><page sequence="16">74 WARREN ZEV HARVEY [16] physical forces. The prooftext is from Psalms 104:4. Mai- monides quotes it as: "Who makest winds His angels."37 Aqui- nas quotes it as: "Who makes His angels spirits."38 Aquinas may have misunderstood Psalms 104:4, but he did not misunderstand Maimonides' doctrine of angels. He saw that Maimonides was rationalizing away supernatural angels, that is, interpreting them out of existence. He saw that Mai- monides was teaching that the true divine miracle is not to be found in the supernaturalness of the angels, but precisely in their naturalness. This naturalism is what Aquinas believed to be "alien to the Scripture." In accordance with his doctrine that angels are natural phe- nomena, Maimonides teaches thrice in the Guide that all biblical descriptions of persons seeing angels refer to a dream or vision; which is to say, the angels exist in the imagination of the prophet, not in the external physical world.39 From this teach- ing of Maimonides, it follows that the account of Jacob's wrestling with the angel, the wondrous story of Balaam's ass, and indeed a large portion of the Abraham narratives, all refer to events which took place in the prophet's mind.40 This teaching, pronounces Aquinas, is "repugnant to the intention of Scripture [repugnat intentioni Scripturae]." Angels, he argues, are indeed incorporeal and thus verily invisible, but they have the power to assume corporeal bodies when they appear to human beings.41 Aquinas, as we have seen above, accepts Maimonides' anal- ysis, according to which angels may be seen by prophets in a 37 P. 262. 38 Aquinas reads with the Vulgate: quifacit angelos suos spiritus. This reading is found also in the Dux Neutrorum, even though it makes no sense in Maimonides' context. 39 Guide, I, 49, p. 109; II, 6, p. 265; II, 42, pp. 388-390. 40 Guide, II, 42, p. 389. 41 Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 51, Article 2. Once again, Aquinas breaks with Maimonidean intellectualism, and cites Augustine in the Sed Contra; cf. above, note 25.</page><page sequence="17">[ 17] MAIMONIDES AND AQUINAS ON INTERPRETATION dream or vision. However, he rejects Maimonides' teaching that all sightings of angels occur in the imagination. With regard to angels, as with regard to God, Aquinas refuses to concede so much to the imagination as Maimonides would require, and at a certain point he is compelled to come to the defense of the literal sense of the biblical text. He does not agree with Maimonides that all descriptions of God are figurative, that is, imaginative; nor does he agree with him that all appearances of angels to prophets occurred in a dream or vision, that is, were imaginative. Just as he holds that it is possible to predicate names of God substantialiter, so he holds that it is possible to see angels in the physical world. VI We have talked about Maimonides' and Aquinas' respective approaches to biblical language concerning God and the angels. There is much more which could be said about these questions, and there is very much more which could be said about the general subject of Maimonides and Aquinas on the interpre- tation of Bible. Aquinas saw in Maimonides not only an Aristotelian true to Scripture, but also an authority on the Hebrew language and on Jewish customs.42 It would also be of interest to examine to what extent Aquinas' Commentaries on the Bible reflect Maimonides' influence.43 My intent in this presentation, however, was only to offer some brief remarks 42 Aquinas, e.g., depends on Maimonides for the view that the phrase "And God called" (Genesis 1:2, 8, 10, etc.) indicates an equivocal usage (Guide, I, 30, pp. 350-352; Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 68, Article 1; Question 69, Article 1). His discussion of the ceremonial laws (Summa Theologiae, Part II, 1, Questions 101-102) contains many references to Maimonides' discussion of the reasons for the commandments (Guide, III, 26-49); cf. A. Funkenstein, "Gesetz und Geschichte," Viator, I (1970), 147-178. See Jacob Guttmann, Der Einfluss der Maimonidischen Philosophie (Leipzig, 1908), pp. 175-204 (photo- reprinted in Dienstag [above, note 20]). 43 Cf. C. Siegfried, "Thomas von Aquino als Ausleger des Alten Testaments," Zeitschrift fir wissenschaftliche Theologie, 37 (1894), 603-625, n.b. p. 614. 75</page><page sequence="18">about the basic nature of Aquinas' agreement and disagreement with Maimonides' way of interpreting the Bible. VII The Great Eagle and the Angelic Doctor were very close on many issues. Aquinas often followed Maimonides approvingly. Yet the religious tempers of the two thinkers were very differ- ent, and this led them to read the Bible very differently. To a Maimonidean, Aquinas must seem a naive traditionalist. To a Thomist, Maimonides must seem an outrageous agnostic. The genius of Aquinas was his ability to seize the radical, potentially subversive Arabic Aristotelian tradition (from Alfarabi through Averroes and Maimonides), and to co-opt it into his grand theology, a brick in his cathedral. That this is true regarding physics and metaphysics is well known. It is also true, as we have seen, with regard to his approach to interpreting the Bible. In co-opting the radical, potentially subversive philosophy into his theology, Aquinas made felicitous use of Rabbi Moses. He portrayed him as an harmonious blend of Jew and Aristo- telian. Aquinas wrote about Maimonides words similar to those he wrote about Augustine. Augustine, he wrote, accepted from Plato everything that did not contradictfides.44 Maimonides, he wrote, sought to make concord between Aristotle and sacra Scriptura.45 In comparing these two statements, it must be remembered that Aquinas was an Aristotelian, not a Platonist. In Aquinas' history of philosophy, Rabbi Moses exemplifies a Jew who was an Aristotelian, and who thereby is proof that you can be faithful to Scripture and also be an Aristotelian. If Maimonides is kosher, then a kosher Aristotelianism is pos- sible. Even as he portrayed Maimonides as a congenial Aristo- telian, Aquinas cast Averroes in the role of the villain. Aristo- telianism, Aquinas would claim, is not objectionable; what is 44 Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 84, Article 5. 45 Summa Theologiae, Part I, Question 50, Article 3.

In sum, Rabbi Moses was for Aquinas the Guide to harmonizing Scripture and Aristotle. To be sure, not everything that sounded harmonious to Maimonides' ears sounded so to Aquinas'. Maimonides' extreme intellectualism and philosophic non-literalistic reading of the Bible certainly were not sweet music to Aquinas' ears. The awesome sublime music of Maimonideanism is not the beautiful mellifluous music of Thomism. The 12th century rabbi and the 13th century saint were both great souls, but their spiritual sensibilities were very different. Or to put it another way: they had marvelously differing imaginations.</page></plain_text>
