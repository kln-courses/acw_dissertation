Unless pollen is uniformly dis tributed in a population, spatial segregation of the sexes should reduce the average mating success of individuals. In three Californian populations of Distichlis spicata - a wind-pollinated grass species that exhibits spatial segregation of the sexes - I examined patterns of pollen movement and the effects of pollen load and nutrient availability on seed set to determine whether spatial segregation of the sexes actually reduces mating success for both males and females. In two of the populations, pollen dispersal was re stricted, and pollen augmentation consistently, significantly increased seed set. However, in the third population - which had the lowest seed set - I found that although there were some indications of pollen limitation, pollen dispersal was not restricted, and seed production was limited primarily by nutrient availability. These results imply that in some populations of D. spicata nutrient limitation on the pro duction of seeds by females may be sufficiently strong that spatial segregation of the sexes causes a fairly low cost to reproductive success compared with a more random distribution of the sexes. However, in other populations, pollen does limit mating success, and the spatial segregation of males and females in these populations is reducing the fecundity of both males and females. Introduction All else being equal, as the average distance be tween males and females increases in a sessile dioecious population, the likelihood that male and female gametes will encounter each other will de cline, potentially limiting both male and female reproductive success (Bawa and Opler 1977; Pennington 1985; Yund 1990; Levitan 1991; Babcock and Mundy 1992; Brazeau and Lasker 1992; Levitan et al. 1992; Cresswell et al. 1995; Burczyk et al. 1996). Nevertheless, in over 30 species of dioecious and subdioecious plants from 20 families, males and females are spatially segre gated - a pattern known as spatial segregation of the sexes, SSS, which usually occurs along an environmental gradient (e.g. Davey and Gibson 1917; Harris 1968; Putwain and Harper 1972; Lloyd 1973; Freeman et al. 1976 first highlighted the pattern; Bawa and Opler 1977; Grant and Mitton 1979; Meagher 1980; Fox and Harrison 1981; Melampy 1981; Wade et al. 1981; Lovett Doust and Cavers 1982; Waser 1984; Vitale and Freeman 1986; Vitale et al. 1987; reviewed by</page><page sequence="2">180 Bierzychudek and Eckhart 1988; Iglesias and Bell 1989; Korpelainen 1991; Dawson and Ehleringer 1993; Freeman et al. 1993; Shea et al. 1993; Lokker et al. 1994; El-Keblawy and Freeman 1999;Bertiller et al. 2002; Marques et al. 2002; Pickering and Hill 2002). Spatial autocorrelation of males and females has been found in over half the plant species in which it has been sought (Bierzychudek and Eckhart 1988), suggesting either that mating does not limit reproductive success in these species or that the benefits of such segregation outweigh the costs. Fertilization may not limit reproductive success in a plant species exhibiting spatial segregation of the sexes if pollen is uniformly distributed throughout a population or if another resource, such a nutrient availability, is the principal limit on seed set. Although long distance pollen dis persal is often underestimated, pollen is never uniformly distributed within populations (Levin and Kerster 1974; Waser and Price 1982; Ellstrand et al. 1989; Godt and Hamrick 1993; Giddings et al. 1997a, b; Lavigne et al. 1998). In fact, pollen dispersal in both animal- and wind-pollinated species is usually strongly leptokurtic (Levin and Kerster 1974; Waser and Price 1982; Tonsor 1985; Giddings 1997a; Lavigne et al. 1998; Nurminiemi et al. 1998). Clearly, if pollen dispersal distance is limited, spatial segregation of the sexes will tend to decrease the average mating success of males in single-sex stands. Moreover, even if the long tail of the pollen distribution ensures that all females in a population with spatial segregation of the sexes receive sufficient pollen to pollinate every ovule, reduced pollen deposition may lead to reduced competition between pollen grains for fertilization of an ovule or reduced selection between devel oping embryos, thus decreasing the reproductive fitness of females (Stephenson 1981; Snow 1986). Currently, there is little data available on whe ther the mating success of both males and females is reduced by spatial segregation of the sexes in natural populations, and circumstantial evidence is conflicting. Meagher (1980) established that seed set was not correlated with distance to the nearest male in Chamaelirium luteum, a species that exhibits spatial segregation of the sexes. These data suggest that female mating success may not be reduced by separation from conspecific males; however, the relative roles of pollen vs. resource limitation in limiting seed set was not assessed. In Atriplex canescens, &amp; dioecious shrub exhibiting spatial segregation of the sexes, McArthur et al. (1978) demonstrated that pollen deposition diminishes rapidly away from males, but even 12 m from a single male, several grains of pollen were collected per square millimeter in a short span of time. In the same species, Freeman et al. (1993) showed that males predominated in upland microhabitats that enhance pollen dispersal, sug gesting that pollen dispersal does limit male mat ing success. In this study, I examined pollen dispersal and seed set in natural populations of the dioecious salt marsh grass Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene (Poa ceae), which exhibits spatial segregation of male and female genets, in which within-population sex ratios vary from 100% male to 100% female along a soil nutrient and water gradient (Freeman et al. 1976; Eppley et al. 1998; Eppley 2000, 2001) (Figure 1). Distichlis spicata is wind-pollinated, a common mode of pollination in plant species exhibiting spatial segregation of the sexes (Shea et al. 1993; Freeman et al. 1997), and it has genetic sex determination, as opposed to environmental sex determination, which occurs in the majority of dioecious plant species exhibiting spatial segrega tion of the sexes (Bierzychudek and Eckhart 1988). Like other species with genetic sex determination and spatial segregation of the sexes, little is known about the proximate mechanisms responsible for this pattern of sex ratio variation in D. spicata (Eppley 2001), and nothing is known about how separation between the sexes affects mating success for this species. In this study, I worked in three populations of D. spicata in California that have large distinct patches of majority-male and majority-female flowering ramets, which are typi cally separated by narrow transition zones of non flowering ramets. To determine whether male and female reproductive success are reduced by spatial separation of the sexes in this species, I measured pollen distribution curves and conducted pollen and nutrient augmentation experiments.

Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene (Poaceae) is a dioecious, perennial grass that is common in estuaries on the east and west coasts of North America (Hitchcock 1971). Pollen is dispersed by wind (Beetle 1943; Hitchcock 1971), seeds are water-dispersed (personal observations, S. Eppley), and extensive asexual propagation occurs via rhizomes (Beetle 1943; Hitchcock 1971). Pollen dispersal measurements To estimate pollen dispersal in this species, I counted the D. spicata pollen grains on D. spicata stigmas. In the Pt. Reyes population, I randomly</page><page sequence="4">182 chose two of the six patches of majority-female flowering ramets. In May 1995, in patch A, which was approximately 300 m2, I set out six parallel transects at 5 m intervals perpendicular to the prevailing wind. I determined that the prevailing wind direction was northwesterly, as suggested by the slant of the local vegetation. The first transect was placed on the upwind edge of the majority female patch, and the remaining transects covered the entire patch in the direction of the prevailing wind. I collected one stigma from each of three ramets at each of eight locations 1 m apart along each transect. This majority-female patch had flowering male ramets 5-10 m away, including in the upwind direction. In May 1995, in patch B (approximately 225 m2) at Pt. Reyes, I set out nine parallel transects perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction (Figure 2). I set up transects and collected stigmas following the same protocol as for Patch A. Patch B had D. spicata flowering male ra mets 5-7 m away, including in the upwind direction. In the Tomales Bay population, I chose one of the seven patches with majorities of female flowering ramets. This patch (approximately 14,000 m2) was the largest of the majority-female patches in either population and was the majority female patch farthest from the nearest flowering male ramet. In June 1995, I set up eight parallel transects spread at 20 m intervals perpendicular to the prevailing wind. I collected stigmas following the same protocol as for Pt. Reyes. This patch had flowering male ramets 40-100 m away, including in the upwind direction. I placed the three stigmas from one location on a glass slide with glycerol and aniline blue stain, and I counted the number of D. spicata-size pollen grains per stigma using a compound microscope. The D. spicata-sizQ pollen grain class on the slides may have included pollen of the same size from other grass species. However, other grass pollen should have been comparatively rare given that the nearest other grass species was 300 m from any of Figure 2.

Wind direction measurements To confirm the prevailing wind direction in the Pt. Reyes and T?males Bay populations during the pollen dispersal experiments, I recorded wind direction to the nearest ten degrees every 20 min at (1) Pt. Reyes: from 0910 to 1810 on 5 June 1995 and from 1430 to 1710 on 13 June 1995 and (2) T?males Bay from 0800 to 1640 on 7 June 1995 and from 1210 to 1850 on 12 June 1995. Pollen augmentation experiments To determine if average seed set is pollen-limited, I conducted pollen augmentation experiments. In May 1995, I randomly chose 52 female ramets at Pt. Reyes, 60 female ramets at T?males Bay, and 50 female ramets at Bodega Bay. For half of the female ramets, I haphazardly chose 20 male infl orescences from 20 ramets in the same population and gently rubbed the pollen-coated anthers on all open stigmas on one inflorescence per ramet be tween 1000 and 1200 at Bodega Bay and between 1300 and 1430 at the other populations. I collected all non-augmented and augmented experimental inflorescences that were present in September 1995 at Bodega and in October 1995 at Pt. Reyes and T?males Bay, and I counted the number of seeds and unexpanded ovules on each inflores cence. I repeated the pollen augmentation experiments at Pt. Reyes in April 1996. I randomly chose six ramets at each of 25 randomly chosen locations within the largest majority-female patch. I aug mented pollen on an inflorescence on half of the ramets, selected at random, between 1000 and 1200, as described above, and counted the number of open stigmas on each inflorescence. In August 1996, I collected the mature inflorescences and counted the number of seeds and unexpanded ovules. I conducted controls for the pollen augmenta tion to determine whether the augmentation method actually increased pollen numbers on stigmas and whether I was performing the aug mentation during the time of day when pollen was naturally released in the population. The controls confirmed that pollen augmentation significantly increased the number of pollen grains per stigma and that augmentations were performed during the time of day when pollen was naturally released (Eppley, unpublished data). Pollen and nutrient augmentation experiment To determine what factors limit seed set in the D. spicata population at T?males Bay - the pop ulation with the lowest seed set and in which pol len-augmentation had little effect - I conducted an experiment using a factorial design in which I manipulated both pollen loads and nutrient availability. In May 1999, I set-out forty-two 90 cm by 45 cm plots, three plots at each of 14 permanently marked random locations in patches with majorities of female D. spicata flowering ra mets. I assigned each of the three plots at a loca tion to one of three treatments: (1) unmanipulated control, (2) trenching, by using a shovel to cut all rhizomes around the edge of the plot, and (3) trenching and nutrient addition. For increased nutrient plots, 32 Jobe? 8 week fertilizer spikes (Weatherly Consumer Products, Lexington, KY) were evenly spaced within the plot, and 400 ml of kelp liquid fertilizer (0.2 N, 1 P, 1 K) was poured over the plot. I marked all ramets in each plot that had an inflorescence with at least one open stigma, for a total of 77 ramets across all plots. I randomly chose half of the flowering ramets in a plot to be augmented with pollen as described above. In September 1999, I collected the surviving marked inflorescences. For two of the locations, I har vested all plant material within each of the three plots, separated inflorescences from these plants, and counted the total number of seeds and inflo rescences. I could only harvest two locations because the process destroys marsh habitat. Data analysis Pollen dispersal measurements For the three majority-female patches, I analyzed the number of pollen grains on stigmas using a nested analysis of variance (SAS Institute 1996), with distance from the upwind edge of the majority-female patch and sampling location</page><page sequence="6">184 (nested in distance) as the main effects. The residuals were normally distributed and variances were homogeneous in this and subsequent analyses of variance. Wind direction measurements I analyzed the effect of sampling day (nested in population) and population on wind direction using an ANCO VA (SAS Institute 1996), with time of day of sampling as the covariate. Pollen augmentation experiments Using a logit model (SAS Institute 1996), I ana lyzed the effects of pollen augmentation and pop ulation on the likelihood of an inflorescence in 1995 producing any seeds, following Christensen (1990). I chose a logit model, rather than a log linear model (e.g. Horvitz and Schemske 1994), because I was interested in how the factors explain the response variable, not how all factors inter relate (Christensen 1990). The presence or absence of seed set in an inflorescence, rather than the percentage of seed set, was used as the outcome variable because inflorescences varied widely on the percentage of flowers that were open during augmentation. Also, the percentage of seed set was very low. Across the three populations and the augmentation treatments, on average only 2.2 percent of ovules produced seeds. I report results of each tested model as likelihood ratio chi-squares, with p values whose significance indicates whether inclusion of that factor or interaction in the model significantly improves fit to the data. For the 1996 augmentation experiment at Pt. Reyes, I used a logit model (SAS Institute 1996) to analyze the effect of augmentation treatment and block on the likelihood of an inflorescence pro ducing seeds, with the number of open stigmas on the day of augmentation included as a covariate. There were insufficient degrees of freedoms to test the interaction between block and augmentation. I also used ANCOVA (SAS Institute 1996) to ana lyze how augmentation treatment and block af fected the percent of seed-producing ovules per inflorescence, with the number of open stigmas included as a covariate. Pollen and nutrient augmentation experiment No analysis of the effects of pollen and nutrient augmentation on seed set in individual inflores cences was performed because no seeds were pro duced on the marked inflorescences. Instead, analyses of the effects of nutrient treatments on (1) seed numbers and (2) inflorescence numbers in whole plots was performed for two locations using separate ANOVAs, with location and nutrient treatment as the main effects (SAS Institute 1996). Trenching the plots was found to have no effect and not included in the final model because there were insufficient degrees of freedom. Results Pollen dispersal measurements For majority-female patches at Pt. Reyes, the distance of a female ramet from the upwind edge of a majority-female patch significantly affected the number of D. spicata pollen grains on its stigma (patch A: ?=127, df=5, F=4.70, p &lt; 0.0008; patch B: ? = 202, df=8, F= 12.57, p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure 3). In both sampled patches, stigmas closest to upwind flowering males had 3-4 times more pollen than samples taken only 1 m away. Sampling location significantly affected pollen density in both patches (patch A: df=39, F=1.68, p &lt; 0.0250; patch B: df=59, F=4.57, p &lt; 0.0001). Differences in average pollen loads between patches A and B suggest spatial hetero geneity in pollen deposition, presumably due to differences in the size and density of upwind pat ches of majority-male ramets and to micro-envi ronmental differences in wind properties. In the patch of majority-female flowering ramets at T?males Bay, distance from the upwind edge of the majority-female patch had no significant effect on the number of pollen grains per stigma (n = 121, df=7, F= 1.74, p &lt; 0.1131) (Figure 3). However, sampling location along a transect significantly affected pollen load (df = 39, F= 1.68, p &lt; 0.0283). Because this patch is so far from the nearest flow ering male (40 m in the non-upwind direction and 45 m upwind), it may fall in the tail of the pollen distribution curve; in which case, even the large 20 m distance between sampled stigmas would not make a significant difference in pollen load. Sur prisingly, given these distances, pollen number per stigma averaged 1.45 grains (SE = 0.21), suggesting high levels of long-range pollen dispersal in this population.</page><page sequence="7">185 o t?I H O Oh O pq 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 (b) 50 100 150 DISTANCE (M) 200 Figure 3.

Different letters indicate least squares means that are significantly different within patches where distance was a significant effect in the overall model. Wind direction measurements The mean wind direction for all sampling times and locations (n = 85) was 51.29 degrees west of north, with a standard error of only 0.60. Wind direction did not significantly differ between the field populations (df = 1, F = 0.48, p &lt; 0.4929), between the sample days within populations (df = 2, F = 0.15, p &lt; 0.8614), or with time of day (df = 1, F = 0.3028,/? &lt; 0.5837). Pollen augmentation experiments Pollen augmentation significantly increased the number of inflorescences that produced seeds in all of the populations. In the first augmentation experiment, which was performed in 1995, the augmentation treatment significantly increased the likelihood that an inflorescence produced any seeds. The three field populations differed in the average percent of inflorescences that set seeds (Table 1), with the T?males Bay population set ting much fewer seeds than the other two popu lations. However, there was no significant interaction between augmentation and population. At Pt. Reyes (n = 32), 50.0% of non-augmented inflorescences set seed while 75.0% of augmented inflorescence set seed. At Bodega Bay (n = 35), 29.0%) of non-augmented inflorescences set seed while 61.0% of augmented inflorescence set seed. At T?males Bay (n = 53), 11.5% of non-aug mented inflorescences set seed compared with 14.8% seed set in augmented inflorescence. In the second pollen augmentation experiment at Pt. Reyes, performed in 1996, augmentation also significantly increased both the number of ramets that produced seeds as well as the percent of ovules per inflorescence to produce seeds (Table 2, Figure 4). Block was a significant effect in both analyses, as was the covariate, number of fresh stigmas on the day of augmentation. Pollen and nutrient augmentation experiment In the pollen and nutrient augmentation experi ment at T?males Bay in 1999, none of the indi vidually tagged inflorescences used for pollen augmentation produced seeds. However, increas ing the level of nutrients in plots with female majorities of D. spicata significantly increased the total number of seeds produced in those plots (Table 3). Plots with augmented nutrient levels had significantly more seeds (X = 20.50 seeds; SE = 2.37) than plots with ambient nutrient levels (X = 3.75 seeds; SE = 1.68). Both locations showed an increase in seed set in the nutrient-en hanced plots, but the effect was greater in one location. Although plots with augmented nutrients had more inflorescences than non-augmented plots, the effect was not significant (df = 1, F=0.26,p &lt; 0.6614). Location and the interaction</page><page sequence="8">186 Table 1. Pollen augmentation experiments in 1995 at Pt. Reyes, Tomales Bay, and Bodega Bay D. spicata populations.

Discussion Bateman's principle - that male fitness is usually limited by mating opportunities while female fit ness is limited by resource availability for egg production (Bateman 1948) - stems from the assumption that on average every egg encounters at least one sperm because sperm are more plen tiful than eggs, and male organisms or sperm are able to successfully locate eggs. The ability to lo cate females or their eggs may be common in animals with internal fertilization that are mobile and can use behavior to respond to female sensory cues; however, it is not the case for many plants or marine invertebrates (Burd 1994; Levitan and Petersen 1995). In fact, pollen limitation is the norm in plant species presumably because repro ductive individuals are sessile (Burd 1994), and sperm limitation is even more common in free spawning invertebrates (Levitan and Petersen 1995). Consequently, spatial segregation of males and females in a dioecious, sessile population should further decrease the ability of male gametes to encounter and fertilize female gametes. Con firming this expectation I found that restricted pollen dispersal, combined with spatial segregation of the sexes, limited mating success and fecundity for both males and females in two populations of the dioecious salt grass Distichlis spicata. How ever, in the third population, pollen was not cor related with distance from the pollen source and nutrient availability had a much stronger affect on seed set than did pollen availability. Only if pollen were uniformly dispersed within a population should spatial segregation of the sexes in a plant species not decrease mating success for males in single-sex patches. However, in the majority-female patches that I sampled in D. spicata populations, pollen loads on stigmas were negatively correlated with distance from po tential pollen sources. In these areas, the number of pollen grains on stigmas dropped by over 30% in just 1 m. This is a faster decline in pollen levels with distance than that measured in other grass species (Giddings et al. 1997a; Nurminiemi et al. 1998). The restricted dispersal of pollen in these D. spicata populations exhibiting spatial segrega tion of the sexes means males just upwind of fe males have more opportunities to father offspring and will probably fertilize more ovules than males in the interior of single sex patches. The supposi tion that limited gamete dispersal leads to higher fertilization rates for males close to egg locations, vs. those far from eggs, has been well-documented in marine invertebrates with water-dispersed ga metes (Pennington 1985; Levitan 1991; Levitan et al. 1992) and in wind-pollinated plants (Burczyk Table 2. Pollen augmentation experiment in 1996 at Pt. Reyes. (A) A logit model was used to determine whether augmentation treatment and block significantly affected whether a ramet produced seeds.

These data were collected from the Pt. Reyes population in 1996. et al. 1996; Nurminiemi et al. 1998). Thus, on average, male fertilization success in these D. spi cata populations is likely to be reduced by spatial segregation of males and females. However, in the D. spicata population at T? males Bay, pollen numbers were not correlated with distance to the pollen source. I found higher levels of pollen per stigma at T?males Bay, over 40 m from the nearest male flowering ramets compared with areas at Pt. Reyes that were less than 10 m from flowering males. While wind direction and distance from the pollen source are Table 3. Pollen and nutrient augmentation experiment at T? males Bay. An analysis of variance was used to determine whether the nutrient treatment, the location in the field popu lation, or an interaction between these effects significantly af fected the number of seeds produced in a treatment plot N=6. df SS F p Nutrient treatment Location Nutrient treatment X Location 1 374.08 33.25 0.0288 1 468.75 41.67 0.0232 1 270.75 24.07 0.0391 the most important indicators of average pollen loads on the stigmas of wind-pollinated grasses (Giddings et al. 1997b; Nurminiemi et al. 1998), measurements of wind speed and wind turbulence are needed to predict pollen distributions (Gid dings et al. 1997b; Nurminiemi et al. 1998). High wind speeds and turbulence, combined with a long tail of the pollen distribution curve and high con centrations of pollen upwind, might explain my results. Male fertilization success does not appear to be limited by spatial segregation of the sexes in this population. Although pollen dispersal is restricted in some D. spicata populations, it does not automatically follow that female fitness is limited by pollen availability. Spatial segregation of the sexes would not decrease mating success for females if a re source other than pollen limited seed production. For example, even pollen loads in the tail of the pollen distribution might be sufficient to fertilize all ovules for which there are sufficient resources to complete development. However, in the three populations of D. spicata that I examined, large</page><page sequence="10">188 scale pollen augmentation significantly increased seed set in females, indicating that pollen avail ability is limiting average fecundity in both females and males. Pollen limitation is not surprising, in that it has been found in 62% of the over 258 plant species in which hand pollinations have been compared with non-manipulated controls (Burd 1994). In another experiment in the T?males Bay population - which had the lowest seed set of the three populations - pollen augmentation did not increase seed set although it had done so to a small degree in previous experiments. However, addi tions of nutrients in this populations increased seed set by over five times. Because nutrient levels vary significantly across this population (Eppley 2000) and the density of ramets may also vary, the relative importance of nutrients and pollen most probably varies over time and space. The interac tion between ramet density and nutrient levels is likely to be the key to understanding the relative importance of the factors limiting seed set in this population, as intraspecific competition has been found to significantly alter a clonal plant's ability to invest in sexual reproduction (e.g. Abrahamson 1975; van Kleunen et al. 2001; Rautiainen et al. 2004). Overall, however, nutrient availability ap pears to be a stronger force than pollen availability in determining seed set in this population. The results from these studies show that factors limiting seed set in D. spicata vary within and between populations. These results concur with recent studies showing temporal and geographic variation in pollen limitation in other plant species (Baker et al. 2000; Totland 2001). In the Tomales Bay D. spicata population, although there is an indication of pollen-limitation in the population, nutrient-limitation is probably a stronger influence on seed set, and pollen dispersal was not restricted. Consequently, spatial segregation of the sexes seems to have only a small effect on male and fe male fecundity in this population. However, in the Bodega Bay and Pt. Reyes populations, the pollen distribution was highly correlated with distance from the pollen source, and seed set was signifi cantly limited by pollen availability. These results suggest two hypotheses for an adaptive explana tion for spatial segregation of the sexes in these populations. On the one hand, the apparent de crease in mating success for both males and fe males reported in two of these three populations may be outweighed by an increase in fitness for individual males and females in their respective microsites. This increase in fitness is due presum ably to the ability of males and females of this clonal species to invest more heavily in vegetative reproduction in their respective microsites even at the cost of reduced sexual reproduction. On the other hand, spatial segregation of the sexes may have evolved under conditions more similar to those found at T?males Bay - which this study demonstrates can occur in this species and in which pollen-limitation is not so important - and which may have changed due to increased anthropomorphic, nutrient inputs in the past decades.
