<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Causal Relation and its Terms ANDREW NEWMAN i. Introduction It is generally accepted that there are such things as physical objects and that physical objects are causally significant, since physical objects, by one means or another, interact with each other. It is also generally accepted that there are such things as causal relations. However, when the philosophical question is posed as to what the terms of the causal relation are, physical objects are passed over, usually in favour of things like events or facts.1 If it is the case that events are the terms of the causal relation then they have a significant claim on our attention as being physically real or elements of reality. Though they may not, then, be the only elements of reality, they will be the most important ones, as causality is commonly regarded as a criterion of what is real. Events are such that if they are once admitted as being what is significant for causality, they will supplant physical objects, which will then assume a secondary importance. Davidson argues that the correct logical form for sentences about causality involves terms which refer to events: But the assumption, ontological and metaphysical, that there are events, is one without which we cannot make sense of much of our most common talk; or so, at any rate, I have been arguing. I do not know of any better, or further, way of showing what there is.2 To show that there are events and that they are the elements of reality which are significant for causality, Davidson uses the syntactic priority thesis,3 which Russell once summarized as inferring the properties of the world from the properties of language.4 For Davidson, then, it is events which are causes and effects, and therefore it is events which are the terms of the causal relation. There is no difficulty associated with events being objects since they immediately qualify as Fregean objects on account of the fact that they only occur once. What is questionable is whether events are important 1 Cf. Donald Davidson, 'Causal relations', in Essays on Actions and Events, Oxford, Oxford University Press, I980, pp. 149-62.

The aim of this paper is to show that events are not elements of reality, and are not the terms of causal relations. And not only is our conclusion different from Davidson's, we also differ from him as to method; so far from being a guide to reality, it will be seen that language is often misleading. It is true that the terms of the causal relation will be objects, that is to say Fregean objects. So let us assume that Frege has sufficiently explained the notion of Fregean object-briefly, a Fregean object is not predicated of anything and only occurs once (for each instant of time, if time is relevant).5 We need then to be able to decide which Fregean objects are physically real and therefore candidates for being the terms of causal relations? Sets, numbers, events, and physical objects are all examples of Fregean objects (though numbers are controversial); but among these, sets and numbers cannot seriously be regarded as candidates for being the terms of the causal relation. Numbers, if they are objects, do not exist in the physical world, and there is no known way of interacting with the world which they do inhabit. There are sets which in some sense inhabit the physical world, namely, those sets whose members are all physical objects. But it cannot be said that we interact causally with a set qua set, for two reasons: first the set is an arbitrary entity, secondly the existence of the set is subordinate to the existence of its members. It is interesting to consider and develop these reasons why sets cannot be the terms of causal relations as events are in many ways analogous to sets. What makes a set to be a unit is the fact that some person insists on taking it to be a unit. A set can be specified in two ways, either by listing the elements or by stipulating that all the elements fall under a certain concept. It may appear as though the concept provides a natural principle of unity for the set which is its extension, nevertheless that set is still an arbitrary collection. It must be admitted that there is something arbitrary about the set of all tigers in a certain cage, and the set of all tigers in India, and so on. Equally, there is something arbitrary about the set of all tigers unqualified, as it must be the set of all tigers existing now, and that is just as much an arbitrary collection as the other sets of tigers. There are probably degrees of arbitrariness; any of our sets of tigers is not as arbitrary as the set which contains the US President, the Taj Mahal, and the empty set. However, such degrees of arbitrariness do not concern us. The set of chairs in a room remains the same set however they are rearranged, providing that no chair is destroyed. When you interact with the chairs you change their positions and perhaps their shapes (slightly) 5See Frege, 'On Concept and Object', etc., in Collected Papers on Mathematics, Logic, and Philosophy, ed. Brian McGuinness, Oxford, Blackwell, j984.</page><page sequence="3">The Causal Relation and its Terms 531 and other attributes. However, nothing about the set qua set is changed. It seems that sets are inert to causal interaction.6 It is only if a chair is destroyed that the set is affected, and then the set simply ceases to exist, since what now exists fails to meet the stipulated conditions. This makes it clear that the existence of a set is subordinate to the existence of its elements. Now if events can be shown to be arbitrary objects like sets, and if the existence of events can be shown to be dependent on the existence of physical objects and their properties, then it seems that events qua events do not take part in causal interactions, from which it follows that events are not the terms of causal relations. Further, if events are subordinate to physical objects and their properties, it follows that physical objects and their properties are more significant as elements of reality than events, which would not be the case if events were the terms of causal relations. Our discussion of events from this point of view will also show that it is in fact very difficult to regard events as the terms of the causal relation. This is the argument of the first part of this paper. In the second part we argue directly that events are not the terms of the causal relation by considering a number of important and representative examples of causality. In none of these examples do events show up as the terms of causal relations. This is not surprising, as if events are subordinate to the objects and properties which are their components, then relations between objects are going to be prior. If there were to be any causal relations between events they would have to be constructed out of relations between objects, but it is difficult to see how such a construction would proceed. Before going on to show that events are arbitrary objects, it should be pointed out that arbitrary objects are to be contrasted with objects which have a natural principle of unity. With respect to this issue, Michael Ayers uses the word 'realist' for those who support his position, as I do, that there are objects with natural principles of unity, and the word 'conceptualist' for those who oppose it: Adopting, then, a 'realist' tone of voice, let me say first that physical objects are natural unities or natural structures which come into existence, continue to exist and cease to exist quite independently of any conceptualizing on our part.7 The realist does not have to be certain in every case, for example, it is often not clear that we have one mountain rather than two. It is sufficient, however, that there be examples of objects which do have a natural principle of unity. The realist admits, as I think would Wiggins, that 6 Cf. D. M.

Indeed, first order sets of physical objects need unified physical objects as members. This suggests that something similar can be said about events as arbitrary objects: they need unified objects (and their properties) as their components. An arbitrary object has to be constructed out of something. 2. Events as arbitrary objects If an object acquires a property, then its acquiring of the property is an event-an event is something which happens. If an object possesses a property, then its possessing the property is a state of affairs-a state of affairs is something which continues. According to Hamlyn, an event corresponds to a non-continuous tensed verb, and a process or state corresponds to a continuous-tensed verb.8 What is it then which is caused? Is it the something which happens, the event, or is it the new state, the state of affairs? Change of position is the most easily understood form of change; and on some views of the world all changes can be analysed in terms of change of position. Change of position is never instantaneous, and physics gives us reason to think that no changes are in fact instantaneous. If then, a change takes time, the object concerned is in a state of change during that period of time. Something which happens can therefore also be described by a continuous tensed verb. If a body acquires a new position, it must possess a velocity in order to do so; what from one point of view is an event, the acquiring of a new position, is from another point of view a state of affairs, the possessing of a velocity. We can, therefore, combine the categories of event and state of affairs as we have one ontological category, not two. We shall use the term 'event' for the new combined category. If an object changes shape or colour, or acquires a new position, velocity, or acceleration, that is an event, in the old sense of the word and in our new sense. When we think of an event we think of an object which has many properties, and we highlight one of those properties. Which property we highlight depends on what we are interested in, or on what sort of interaction the object is participating in, though of course it may be participating in several. If an object is somehow constituted out of its properties as in certain metaphysical theories of objects associated with immanent realism,9 then an event somehow involves one of those properties twice. When we refer to an event, we have to specify a time, as a time-index 8 D. W. Hamlyn, Metaphysics, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, I984, p. 56. 9 See Hamlyn, Metaphysics, p. 57, and Armstrong, Nominalism and Realism, ch. 9 and ii.</page><page sequence="5">The Causal Relation and its Terms 533 is essential to an event. We can distinguish a 'point event' from an 'interval event', where a point event requires only one instant of time to be specified, and an interval event requires a finite period of time to be specified. Consider a simple event such as 'object a having property P at time t'; this is a point event and we can write it: Et(a; P). 'Object a having property P during time interval t1-t2' is an interval event, and can be written: Et -t (a; P). These are both simple events where a simple event can be defined as one which involves only one property.10 At time t object a has many properties: P1, P2, P3,..., and to each there must correspond a different simple point event. Causal theory requires them to be different events as the properties P2 and P3 for example, may have nothing to do with the causal interaction P1 figures in. If we are given an object and a time we can select events simply by selecting different properties of the object, taking them one at a time, or two at a time and so on. Selecting an event in this way by arbitrarily choosing properties is like selecting a set by arbitrarily choosing objects. If we are led to choose a particular event it is on account of that property of that object being relevant to a certain causal interaction; it is the object and its properties though which come first. If we can select any number of properties then we can select all the properties of the object to give the event: Et(a; P1... RP). We can call this event the maximal point event relative to that object at that time, though how it differs from the object itself is obscure. Perhaps the difference is analogous to the difference between an object and the singleton set of that object. A simple event, such as E(a; P), does not have a natural principle of unity in the way a physical object does, as which property is selected to be included in the event is arbitrary; the property P is highlighted merely because someone insists on highlighting it. If a simple event appears to have a principle of unity, it is probably associated with the principle of unity of the object concerned. Moreover, reference to that event is always via the object concerned. Are events always associated with objects? Could it not be that what really exists are bare events out of which we construct objects? Now the sort of object which is being contrasted with an event is an object with a principle of unity, a unified object. However, for the purposes of physical causality the sort of objects usually required are physical objects, which are unified objects which exist in space and time. Physical objects include not only material objects, but objects not made of matter, such as fields. It is possible for unified objects to persist through time as it is possible for their principles of unity to persist through time; in contrast, events by their very nature, do not persist through time. Now it is possible to obtain events from a unified object by arbitrarily dividing up the worldline 10 It might be necessary to consider events such as Et,-t,(a; P1 -* P2) where object 'a' divests itself of property P1 and acquires property P2. Such an event has to be an interval event.</page><page sequence="6">534 Andrew Newman of the unified object, whereas, it is not possible to obtain a unified object from events unless a principle of unity is recognized as persisting through time. Unified objects are, therefore, in some way prior to events. If there are unified objects then it is not the case that the world is a world of bare events, where a bare event is an event which does not involve a unified object.1" It does not follow that there are no bare events, but I suspect it would be very difficult to find any examples. Strawson argues that there are bare events: But that a flash or a bang occurred does not entail that anything flashed or banged. 'Let there be light' does not mean 'Let something shine'.12 As far as 'entailment' and 'meaning' go, no doubt Strawson is right. Suppose a flash was followed by a bang, and that such flashes were always followed by such bangs, would we conclude that the bangs were caused by the flashes? Hume might, but most people, particularly physicists, would not. Flashes and bangs have a phenomenal sort of existence and are caused by something else, that is to say by some physical object. Similarly, if someone says 'Let there be light' and there is light, we would expect it to have a source. If it had no source, then as an oscillating electromagnetic field it would be a physical object in its own right, something which persists through time. If a bare event is a point event then that event and its properties only exist at that time, and in fact exist for no time at all. There is something problematic about something existing only at a point in time-in fact for no time at all. If a point event were ontologically dependent on something else such as an interval event, or a physical object, then the notion of point event can be allowed as being a limit of something.13 But the very idea of a bare event is that it should stand alone, as something ontologically self-subsistent. If a bare event is to be understood as an interval event, then what is the rationale for choosing that particular segment of worldline? If it is the persistence of a property or a group of properties, is not that grounds for asserting the existence of a persisting physical object? At any rate it is the properties which are ontologically prior. If it is not the persistence of properties then what is it? The problem of the existence of bare events is closely related to the problem of the existence of bare isolated properties, that is properties which are not the property of any object. Only if there can exist a single bare isolated property, is it reasonable to suppose there are bare simple events, whether point events or interval events. A bare complex event would then have to be some sort of collection of bare simple events. 11 A bare event is not constructed out of any sort of object. 12 P. F. Strawson, Individuals, London, Methuen, I959, p. 46. r3 For a discussion of points of space and points of matter as limits see Andrew Newman, 'A Metaphysical Introduction to a Relational Theory of Space', The Philosophical Quarterly, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="7">The Causal Relation and its Terms 535 However, it is generally assumed, or argued, in the theory of universals that a single property cannot exist alone but must be the property of some object,14 from which it follows that there are no such things as bare events. It might be possible to define a type of event in terms of the state of all the things at a certain space-time location. Such an event would have a principle of unity similar to that of an aggregate or crowd, but such events will not do for causal theory. Not every aspect of that space-time location will be relevant to a given causal interaction since for a given causal interaction only a few properties will be relevant. A collision is a paradigmatic example of cause and effect. If the cause of what happens is to be an event, then two objects and several properties have to be mentioned. That event has no spatio-temporal unity, as the two objects can be any distance apart and yet be bent on a collision. We can call an event involving more than one object a 'separated event'. There is really only one principle of unity for such an event and that is that it is that event which will lead to the effect we are interested in assigning a cause to. There is also the further problem that there is no unique cause but rather a continuum of events which lead to the effect. Consider the event Et(a; v) of a body 'a' having velocity v at time t. Let us try to assign a cause to this event-for every event has a cause. Suppose a force acted from time to to time t and brought the body's velocity up from u to v. The interval event of the force acting from time to to t is part of the cause. But whatever caused the body to have the initial velocity u is also part of the cause, and that could have been a very long time ago. The cause of the event Et(a; v) has at least two parts and would have to be thought of as a complex separated event with no conceivable principle of unity except that it leads to the event Et(a; v). There is no reason for saying that we have one event rather than two events, or vice versa; whether there are two events or just one is entirely a matter of human choice. As was explained earlier, Et(a; P1) and Et(a; P2) are two different simple events, whereas Et(a; P1, P2) is one event, a complex event. If we insist on talking about the event which is the cause of Et(a; v) then that event is a complex event whose only principle of unity is that of being the cause of Et(a; v). It seems that the events needed for causal theory have no natural principles of unity; they can only be understood as arbitrary objects. To underline this point consider interval events. Only rarely is natural time interval given us, usually the choice of end-points for the time interval is arbitrary. Moreover, events of this type can overlap, for example Et It2(a; P), Eti t3(a; P) and Et, t4(a; P) overlap. It would seem unreasonable 14 Cf. Armstrong, Nominalism and Realism, Ch. i i.</page><page sequence="8">536 Andrew Newman to regard them all as equally elements of reality. However, the view that events are the terms of the causal relation seems to demand this, as a cause might be capable of producing Et -t (a; P) but not Et -t3(a: P). It is, however, not possible to regard two overlapping interval events as distinct elements of reality as where they overlap we would have two elements of reality, a difference without a distinction. Davidson makes the point that as events are objects they can be referred to by incomplete descriptions, and further, that they can be referred to successfully by partial descriptions betrays the fact that they are objects. For Davidson, it is the event in all its fullness which does the causing. It does not matter that we do not know, or simply do not supply the full details of the event which is the cause. As it is an object it is enough that we refer to it successfully, which we can do by means of partial descriptions: '. . . but they share Mill's confusion if they think every deletion from the description of an event represents something deleted from the event described.'15 However, the events which we need for causes are complex events involving more than one object; their principle of unity is not spatio- temporal location. Like simple events they are reality sliced in a certain way, that is, looked at from a certain point of view, with only certain properties highlighted. These considerations raise serious problems about how to refer to events. It is not clear that a partial description, by itself, succeeds in referring to the event being thought of, since for reference to be successful there must be some way of finding out what the rest of the event is. For a physical object the principle of unity will enable you, in principle, to discover the things about the object not given by the referring description. For complex events where there is no natural principle of unity, there is no way to discover what the other things are. The only ways to refer successfully to an event, are either to specify the objects and properties completely, or, to refer to it as the event which caused such and such an effect. Even this latter method of reference is open to objection. Events come in sequences; the possible causes of an event Et are the events (complex events) which preceded it in time, and led up to it. The expression 'the complex event which caused Et' is ambiguous, as at all times over a certain period of time prior to to tohere is a complex event which can be thought of as the cause of Et. This point is more obvious for the simple mechanical examples which I prefer, and less obvious for more homely examples, such as acts of eating causing illness. However if we were to analyse a chain of events starting with some food being spoilt, and then proceeding to a mealtime and time of digestion, and then to illness, we would probably find similar ambiguity. We conclude that events are arbitrary objects, and that events as such 15 Davidson, op. cit., p. 157.</page><page sequence="9">The Causal Relation and its Terms 537 are unsuited to be the terms of causal relations, in the same way that sets are unsuited to be the terms of causal relations. Arbitrary objects have to be constructed out of something and events, which are arbitrary objects, are constructed out of objects and their properties. Events are therefore subordinate to objects and their properties. If it can now be shown that there are relations between objects which have a good claim to be called causal relations, then any relations between events which were candidates for being causal relations would be subordinate to them. I suspect, though, that there are not any relations which are even candidates for that position. It is objects and their properties which are significant for causality; arbitrary groupings of those objects and properties are not, as such, going to enter into causal relations with each other. In answer to the question 'are there events?' or 'do events exist?' it is possible to answer 'yes', provided it is added that events exist in the same way that sets of physical objects exist. (Events also exist with the same sort of abundance as first order sets of physical objects.) To admit that in some sense sets and events exist is not to admit that they are elements of reality, or that they are real in the same way that physical objects and their properties are physically real. It can be said of a set that as a set it has been given existence by human choice, and exactly the same thing can be said of an event. However, to admit that in some sense events exist is not to admit that events as arbitrary objects have any significance for the ontology of causality. In some contexts, it might be useful and convenient to talk about events in the same way that it is useful and convenient to talk about sets. But what we frequently talk about, and even what it is useful and convenient to talk about, is not by itself a guide to what is real. A point event such as Et(a; P) is simply the property P being instanced by the object a at time t, or the act of object a having property P at time t. How does it help to say that we have a special sort of entity here? What reason is there to say that there is a special sort of entity? Is not ontology as well served by objects and their properties? If the event is a change in properties, which is an interval event such as Et-t(a; P1 -* P2) how is ontology served by reifying the changing of properties, thereby making the act of changing an entity in its own right. To argue that there is an object which is 'a changing of properties' from the fact that we talk about 'the changing of properties', is like taking that theory of meaning which is naturally and usefully discussed in terms of truth conditions and then turning 'truth conditions' into a special sort of object; such a move would indicate a lack of understanding of that theory of meaning.16 16 It is considered an advantage of that theory that it does not multiply kinds of entity, cf. Mark Platts, Ways of Meaning, London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979, p. 35.</page><page sequence="10">538 Andrew Newman 3. Ideals of causality If we understood something of the nature of the causal relation, we would be in a better position to understand the nature of the terms of the causal relation. Unfortunately examples of causality do not fall under a single type, nor can they be easily resolved into a limited number of types. On the other hand, if causality is to be taken seriously, then causal analysis must be a possibility. It must be possible to break down a causal situation into a series of basic physical and mental interactions, and among these we may be more fortunate in finding a limited number of types of causality.17 I suggest, therefore, that there are at least five basic types of ideals of causality. They are 'force relation', 'energy exchange', 'mechanical trigger', 'information trigger', and 'free-will initiative'. From an examin- ation of these representative types of causality it will be seen that there are relations which are productive relations and which we cannot really refuse to call causal relations, and it will also be seen that events are not the terms of those relations. (i) Force relation It is easy to understand forces as being causes: a force causes an acceleration, it causes a change in velocity and a change in position. Physicists would agree to such statements. Most other people regard the body responsible for the force as the cause: the horse caused the cart to move, the sun causes the motion of the earth, and so on. It does also seem permissible to say that a force caused the cart to accelerate, and it does seem permissible to say that the horse caused the cart to accelerate. We do seem to have a choice here. A force cannot be regarded as something in its own right, as it is neither an object nor a property of an object. Suppose two qualitatively identical bodies, A and B, approach each other along a straight line, exert a repulsive force on each other for a short time, and then return whence they came. If we ask the cause of the acceleration of body A, then it is the force exerted on it by body B; and if we ask the cause of the acceleration of body B, then it is the force exerted on it by body A. Newton's third law tells us that those forces are equal and opposite. Where are those forces? There are no forces in the space between body A and B if the force is due to a field, since there is no force where there is no body for the field to act on. What Newtonian mechanics does is to look at each body in 17 Today our analysis of physical phenomena terminates with quantum descriptions. Even according to the usual interpretations quantum phenomena can be understood in terms of the energy-exchange ideal of causality. David Bohm has given an interpretational model which shows that Quantum Mechanics is not inconsistent with complete determinism, D. Bohm, 'A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of "Hidden Variables", Part I', Physical Review, 1952, pp. I66-79. It is the lack of a conceptual understanding of the correspondence principle which provides a difficulty for causal analysis.</page><page sequence="11">The Causal Relation and its Terms 539 isolation and ask what forces act on it; a force as it is discussed in Newtonian mechanics is something looked at from a one-sided point of view. Such a force is neither an object nor a property of an object. It is in fact a one-sided way of looking at a force-relation which does have a plausible claim to being an element of reality. A force relation is an example of a causal relation and it is something mutual, holding between bodies, not between events.18 We habitually make a distinction between the cause and the conditions for the effect to occur. A certain movement of the cart is caused by a certain force, the nature of the origin of the force being of no consequence to the effect. But that determinate movement would not have occurred unless certain other conditions had obtained, namely, the reaction of the road, the friction of the road and the air resistance. These are all forces, but acting by themselves they will not cause movement as they are reactive forces. We will, for the moment, call these other forces 'conditions' for the effect, as opposed to the cause of the effect. Other conditions for the effect include the mass of the body which the force is acting on, and perhaps the laws of mechanics, and so on. In the force-relation ideal of causality, what we choose to call 'cause' is contemporary with what we choose to call 'effect'. In fact the causal relation here is quite symmetrical and mutual.19 On the other hand, in the energy exchange ideal of causality what we call cause is prior in some sense to the effect as the energy usually has to be sent at a finite speed across a finite distance. (2) Energy exchange Physical interactions can be understood in two ways, either in terms of forces or in terms of the exchange of energy.20 The orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics understands interactions in terms of energy exchange and not in terms of force. If the sun's rays fall on a body its temperature will rise. In classical physics you could analyse it in terms of forces produced by oscillating electromagnetic fields, but even in classical physics it is natural to understand the causal interaction in terms of energy exchange. Here also we have a choice as to what we call the cause. We can either say that the incident radiation caused the rise in temperature, or we can say that the body was warmed by the sun; and we can also say 18 If anyone should doubt the physical significance and reality of forces, they should note that so austerely a quantum mechanical entity as the vacuum is capable of exerting a measurable force, as in the Casimir effect, see I. J. R. Aitchison, 'Nothing's plenty: the vacuum in modern quantum field theory', Contemporary Physics, I985, pp. 333-91. 19 One of Kant's categories was that of community, or reciprocity between agent and patient, Critique of Pure Reason, B io6. 20 There are other ways of looking at Newtonian Mechanics, but only these two provide ideals of causality, cf. H. Hertz, The Principles of Mechanics (I884), transl. D. E. Jones and J. T. Walley, New York, Dover, 1956, the Introduction.</page><page sequence="12">540 Andrew Newman that the sun caused the flow of radiation, and the flow of radiation caused the rise in temperature. In this case the causal relation between the sun and the body amounts to an exchange of energy, in the same way that according to the force ideal of causality, the causal relation amounts to a force relation. On the energy exchange ideal the terms of the causal relation are presumably emitters and receivers of energy, which are, of course, bodies not events. Admittedly we can say that the sun causes a flow of radiation, in other words it causes a region of space to contain a certain intensity of radiation energy flowing in a certain direction. But this radiation is 'something' in motion. If the rise in temperature has a cause it also has conditions. For example, the body will have been exchanging energy with its local surroundings, though these exchanges would not by themselves have led to a temperature rise. Other conditions include the nature of the surface of the body, its mass, and specific heat. If we do a causal analysis of a force-relation we often find that at whatever level we examine we are still dealing with forces. If two classical bodies exert a force on each other via a connecting string, then the action of one part of the string on another part can be understood in terms of forces. (The matter of force fields is more difficult and cannot be discussed here.) Similarly, if we do a causal analysis of an energy exchange interaction, we find there is energy flow at whatever level we examine.21 (3) Mechanical trigger It is tempting to regard physical causality as the only type of causality and to say that the energy exchange ideal, as it is the one favoured by modern physics, is all there is to causality. We know what is the cause and we know what is the effect, as there is a net energy flow from cause to effect; and as energy flow takes time, the cause is always prior to the effect. This is Quine's view.22 The difficulty with this view is that there are certain counter-examples which it is difficult not to regard as examples of causality. In some architectural extravagance, for example, a large concrete ball could be lodged precariously near the top of a building. When we ask what causes it to remain there, the answer is in terms of certain forces, which, of course, do no work, and therefore no energy is exchanged. Despite the fact the cause and effect are contemporary, there is a definite order of dependence.23 This example should be regarded as an examDle of the 21 We have not mentioned probabilistic causality where there is an interaction and a range of possible outcomes, but where the actual outcome is a matter of chance, and where it is not supposed that there is any underlying determinism. Such cases will probably fall under ideals (i) or (2), cf. Anscombe, op. cit. in n. 24. 22 See W. V. Quine, The Roots of Reference, La Salle, Ill., Open Court, 1973, section 2. 23 Cf Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, B 248 ff., and Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Pt.

We know exactly what things the causal relation holds between, they are certainly not events, but it is very difficult to categorize the effect. When we turn on the light switch we cause the light to come on, but we do not thereby contribute any energy to that effect. The work done in moving the switch does not involve electrical energy, it is a form of a mechanical work which is then dissipated. Similarly, turning on the tap causes a flow of water, but it contributes no energy to the flow of water. These are examples of triggers. They are instances of causal relations where the cause contributes no energy to the effect-contra Quine. When we were discussing the force-relation ideal and the energy- exchange ideal of causality we made a distinction between the cause and certain other 'conditions'; even though those conditions included forces, where the cause was a force, and included energy interactions, where the cause was an energy interaction. It is clear that in cases where we have mechanical triggers that there are other important conditions which are productive of the effect. If the tap is on and the water is flowing when we enter the bathroom, and someone asks: 'what causes this water to flow?' we could reasonably answer: 'a certain head of water, that is a pressure difference'. The pressure difference can, of course, be understood in terms of forces; the energy-exchange theorist, however, will have to weave some implausible story about energy flowing from the potential state to the kinetic state. There are also conditions such as the length and diameter of the piping, and the temperature of the water. All these determinate conditions combine to produce the determinate effect. The absence of a block at a certain point in the pipe, that is the absence of a restraining force, such as that provided by a closed tap, is certainly one of those conditions. The absence of a restraint, that is, that other things are indeed equal, is a condition for all causal situations, but not always one we draw attention to. We could try saying that the cause of the water beginning to flow is the tap being turned on, and that the cause of it continuing to flow is the head of water. But this will not do, as if there were no head of water, it would not have begun to flow, and if the tap were not on, it would not continue to flow. Perhaps, then, what counts as a cause depends on what aspect of the situation we are interested in. There are two possible resolutions of the problem. One is to focus on the intuitive notion of 'instigate' and regard the active factor as the cause, and to regard the static, passive factors as mere conditions. This is, I believe, the approach of ordinary language and common sense, and I think it has something to be said for it. The other approach is to regard all the prior conditions which are required for the effect as the cause-quite a mixed bag as we have pointed out. This is the approach of the philosophers. It regards the highlighting of one factor as the instigator of the effect as somewhat subjective. In static causal situations like the concrete ball on</page><page sequence="14">542 Andrew Newman top of a building, it is implausible to pick out one factor. On the other hand in causal situations where something happens, it often does make sense to pick out one factor. Though I sympathize with the common- sense habit of picking out one active factor, it is not an issue I have much interest in resolving.24 (4) Information trigger The fourth ideal of causality is that of information trigger. If the President presses a button in order to send up a missile, then.it is possible that his pressing the button completes a circuit which starts the rocket motor, and that is all there is to it. It would be an example of a mechanical trigger- for our purposes electricity is part of mechanics. On the other hand, the link between pressing the button and the missile being launched could involve the sending and reading of messages, either using human agents or using machines. Strictly speaking such a message is a command, but it is a command which involves information. Reading a message does not usually or necessarily involve the transfer of energy from the message writer to the message reader. Nor does it involve a force relation: the reader's new informational state does not come about because the message writer exerted a force on him; nor does it involve a mechanical trigger, at least this is not the interaction between message writer and message reader. An information trigger is plausible as a causal relation as it not only instigates something to happen, it can transfer the specification of what should happen. Information triggers are interesting on account of the possibility that neither energy nor momentum need be transferred from message writer to message reader, and the way in which this comes about. It is true that when a message is written that forces are exerted and energy is transmitted and dispersed, for example, potential energy may be locked up in the message. It is also true that when a message is read that energy is transmitted and dispersed and that forces are exerted. But it does not follow that any of the energy or momentum put forth in the writing of the message is transmitted to the reader. A written message is something which is quite static and inactive; it may contain potential energy locked up, but there is no reason why that potential energy should be unlocked in the reading of it. It follows that we can have two 'circuits' each of which are closed under the conservation laws but which nevertheless interact causally with each other, and this is a physical possibility not a mere logical possibility. An information trigger is very similar to a mechanical trigger; they are 24Cf. G. E. M. Anscombe, 'Causality and Determination' (I97I), in The Collected Papers of G.E.M. Anscombe, vol. 2, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, I98I. Anscombe emphasizes the intuitive notion of the cause being productive of the effect, and at the end she says: 'The most neglected of the key topics in this subject are: interference and prevention.'</page><page sequence="15">The Causal Relation and its Terms 543 both triggers, they are species of the same genus. A mechanical trigger contributes no energy or force (or momentum) to the effect, and the same can be said for an information trigger. But there are differences. A mechanical trigger does not contribute to the nature of what is going to happen; it simply makes it happen at that time, unleashing powers and forces which determine what should happen. Whereas, an information trigger can be the main determining factor governing the nature of what happens. Also, information triggers admit of time lags; the information can remain unread for an indefinite period of time. Whereas for a mechanical trigger time is of the essence: a mechanical trigger simply determines when those powers and forces should be unleashed. (5) Free-will initiative The four previous ideals of causality were all mechanical or physical; in other words they did not involve anything unknown to physics. However, on the face of it, the world we live in is a world in which there is also human agency. I suggest that our habitual way of understanding human agency, metaphysically speaking amounts to free-will initiative. It is of course controversial whether there is any such thing, as there are those who contend that a human person is simply an over-complicated mechanical system. In which case, human agency only appears to be a distinct ideal of causality; it is in reality reducible to various physical ideals of causality.25 This, though, is not an issue we can resolve here. There is no doubting, however, that human agency understood as a matter of free-will is one of our important 'ideals' of causality, so that to omit it in a catalogue of ideals of causality would seem strange.26 In the natural world where everything is governed by natural laws, no thing ever takes any initiative. If a stream is made to flow in a new channel because of a landslide, that landslide is causally related to something else, and so back and back. Everything which happens has a cause sufficient to make it happen, a cause adequate to the effect. If something happens in a way which is not precisely determined, then which of the possible alternatives comes about is a matter of chance. Even information systems such as computers do not initiate anything; their method of working is 25 It is possible to be a substance-dualist or a property-dualist and still be a determinist; on those views it is usually the physical aspect which determines what happens, with the mental aspect merely following along. 26 Cf. H. L. A. Hart and A. M. Honore, Causation in the Law, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1959, ch. 3, they discuss human agency in terms of voluntary acts but do not raise the metaphysical issue of free-will. Cf. the comments of Colin McGinn on pp. I2I and I22 of The Character of Mind, Oxford, Oxford University Press, I982. Freedom seems to presuppose some sort of independence of the mind from the machine; for recent comments on this issue from the point of view of causality see Mark Bedau, 'Cartesian Interaction', in Midwest Studies in Philosophy, Volume X, Studies in the Philosophy of Mind, ed. Peter A. French, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, I986, and R. C. Richardson, 'The "Scandal" of Cartesian Interactionism', Mind, 1982, pp. 20-37.</page><page sequence="16">544 Andrew Newman purely causal and deterministic, except if you are unlucky. Now the human mind, as conceived of by those who believe in free-will, is capable of initiative; it does things without adequate prior cause. The mind possesses a self-determining power. Choice is not to be understood as chance; chance is blind, choice is deliberate. For humans there does not exist an adequate set of causal conditions for our choices; whereas for God, there are presumably no causal conditions at all behind his decisions. It may be that some of our intuitions concerning cause and effect are essentially anthropomorphic, that when we look for the cause we are looking for the 'who' which initiated the matter, and 'who' is therefore responsible. The 'who' which initiates something is an object, if a somewhat exalted type of object. We naturally think of such an initiator as the cause, and clearly this 'cause' is an object not an event. Our aim in describing these ideals was to set forth a broad and representative set of ideals of causality. We have here examples of relations which are productive relations, and which involve dependency, in accordance with our intuitions about causality, but we do not find events appearing as the terms of those relations. All these ideals are undoubtedly examples of causation, but in none of them do we find any other relations which do have events as their terms. What is significant for these causal relations are unified objects and their properties and relations. The only relations which are candidates for being causal relations are the ones we described, and ones like them. 4. Causality and continuity If the physical world were such that bodies did not move in continuous paths and interactions between bodies did not involve contiguity of some sort, we would have difficulty understanding how causality worked. Nevertheless, as Russell has pointed out continuity does itself present certain difficulties for causality.27 Consider two events Et and Et linked by a common worldline but separated by a finite' distance and existing at different times? How could Et be a cause of Et? We have it on the authority of David Hume and Max Born that cause and effect must be contiguous. Indeed it does seem reasonable that if one thing is to act on another then those two things must in some way make contact.28 However here there is no possibility of any interaction between Et and Et, let alone contiguous interaction, unless, it is that Et, emits something which is 27 B. Russell, 'On the Notion of Cause', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1912-13, reprinted in Mysticism and Logic, London, George Allen and Unwin, 1917. 28 David Hume, An Abstract of a Treatise on Human Nature, and Max Born, The Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1949, ch. II.</page><page sequence="17">The Causal Relation and its Terms 545 subsequently received by Et, but events, as such, are not emitters and receivers. The ideal of contiguity seems to require a chain of cause and effect linking Et and Et. Newton's cradle is a good illustration of what is normally thought of as a chain of cause and effect. Five steel balls are hung in a row (by bifilar suspension) touching each other, one is swung out and allowed to collide into the others; the impulse is wholly imparted to the next ball, and so on until the last ball swings outwards. If the balls were separated slightly from each other you could see it all happening, though the impulse would no longer be totally transmitted. This is a paradigmatic example of the contiguity of cause and effect; it involves objects moving continuously and then interacting by contact. There is, however, no possibility of regarding a chain of events such as those between Et and Et as a chain of contiguous causes and effects. Given any two distinct events between Et and Et, however close together, they still exist at different times and are separated by a finite distance. There is no more possibility of them interacting than there is for Et and Et themselves. The events that we are considering lie on a worldline and are indexed by time, and therefore are in one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. It follows that event Et has no immediate successor with which to interact. Any event after Et, however close to Et, exists at a different time and a different place from Et. Events are not, and cannot be the sort of things which interact with each other. Therefore they cannot be the terms of the causal relation. Similar difficulties afflict all theories which posit independently existing point entities. For example, a theory which dealt with material points would face the dilemma that two material points were either separated by a finite distance or coincided: as Leibniz wrote to de Volder 'One unit is not touched by another .'29 On the other hand extended bodies can touch at a point if a point is regarded ontologically in the Leibnizian manner as a limit of something with finite extension.30 Similarly, there is no problem with the interaction of extended bodies which persist through a finite period of time, whether the interaction is a force-relation, which is simultaneous, or an energy exchange, where energy is transmitted continuously at finite speed. Interval events also face problems. Two interval events cannot interact 29 iIth Oct. I705, C. I. Gerhardt, Die Philosophischen Schriften von G. W. Leibniz, Berlin, i875- 90, vol. II, p. 279, translated by Bertrand Russell, A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, I900, p. 247. 30 Leibniz illustrates his view by considering a triangle with a broad base being divided into several triangles by lines drawn from the vertex to different points on the base. When separated the triangles each have a point which is their top vertex; when joined together again all those vertices coincide in one point. So any number of extended objects can meet at one point, provided points are understood as limits of extended objects. Letter to des Bosses, 24 April I709, Gerhardt, op. cit., p. 370, trans. L. E.

If they exist at different times and in different places something would have to be sent from one to the other; but interval events are no more the sort of things which send and receive things than point events are. If two interval events overlap we have the problem of individuation which was mentioned in section 2. If one interval event stops at the same point that the other begins it is evident that the distinction between them is arbitrary, and we will look in vain for an interaction between them. Russell suggests that the old notion of causality has been replaced in modern science by the uniformity of nature, in particular by the deterministic evolution of a system as governed by physical law.31 A physical system, which is assumed to be isolated, evolves from a certain definite state at time t1, to another definite state at the later time t2. Though there is no reason to suppose that all physical changes are continuous, the deterministic evolution considered by physics is usually thought of as continuous and therefore describable by continuous math- ematical functions. If events are causes and effects, then the event which is the state of the system at t1 could be regarded as a cause of the event which is the state of the system at t2. It would be far-fetched to say that there was a causal relation between these events, and in fact neither Russell nor J. R. Lucas suggest this.32 The notion of causal relation and of distinct causes and effects has been replaced by that of the continuous development of an isolated system. Lucas regards this development as causal develop- ment and he uses the term 'causal cord' for segments of the causal development of a system. But it does not follow that because a system is evolving deterministically that it is evolving causally. An isolated body moving uniformly in a straight line according to Newton's first law is a counter-example. The motion is deterministic but not causal: uniform motion in a straight line is not caused by anything. The basis of the Newtonian point of view is that uniform straight line motion is one of the things which can happen when there are no external causes. Leibniz, on the other hand, posited an internal power responsible for the continued motion. But what if the internal power stopped working, would the body cease to move-and is that with respect to absolute space? The notion of an internal causal power making a body to move in a straight line is difficult to make any sense of, particularly for a relationist. In fact, uniform motion in a straight line has no cause, internal or external. Suppose now that a field is switched on and that field causes the body to deviate from straight line motion and to adopt some sort of curved path. We can say that the change in path is caused by the field, or, that the new curved path is caused by whatever is reponsible for the field. 31 Russell, op. cit., Mysticism and Logic, pp. I96-9. 32 J. R. Lucas, Space, Time and Causality, Oxford, Clarendon Press, I984, ch. X.</page><page sequence="19">The Causal Relation and its Terms 547 There is no reason to say that events on the path are causally related, nor to say that a segment of the path is a causal cord. Neither would Russell or Lucas have us say such things. The system which evolves deterministically is an isolated one, and our body which is now in a field is no longer isolated. The isolated system is the body, the field, and whatever is responsible for the field. Let us suppose then that we have two bodies with a Newtonian gravitational field acting between them. The state of this system at time t1 involves two positions and two velocities. In the Lagrangian formulation of Newtonian mechanics the development of this combined system is dealt with by considering the motion of a representative point in a six-dimensional space, called configuration space. The co-ordinates of the representative point are a combination of the three spatial co-ordinates of the first body and the three spatial co- ordinates of the second body. The development from the 'position' at time t1 to that at time t2 is represented by a segment of a path in configuration space. In the Hamiltonian formulation the state of the system as opposed to its 'position' is represented by a point in phase space or state space. A state of the system is given by all the independent positions and momenta. The development of the system from its state at t1 to its state at t2 is represented by a segment of a path in its phase space, and it is this segment which Lucas would call a causal cord. The state of the system at a time is an event, so a causal cord is something which connects events; it follows that if the causal cord is to be of any metaphysical significance it will be in terms of events, with all the problems associated with events which we raised earlier. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations are excellent formalisms for representing the deterministic nature of certain systems which can be dealt with by Newtonian Mechanics. Apart from that it is question- able how metaphysically illuminating they are. Causality has to do with interaction, with one thing acting on another, whereas causal cords as dealt with by these more advanced formulations involve seeing a system as an isolated whole.33 Consequently the Lagrangian, Hamil- tonian, or similar formulations neither replace nor undermine our ideals of causality. 5. Conclusion Events are like sets in being arbitrary objects and as such it is implausible that they be the terms of causal relations, if only by analogy with sets. An arbitrary object has to be constructed out of something, and for events that something is objects and properties of objects. We can find relations 33 Though it should be noted that perturbation theory had its origin in these formulations of classical mechanics. Perturbation theory is an approximation method which deals with an interaction as a small energy increase contributed from the outside.</page><page sequence="20">548 Andrew Newman between objects which are clearly causal relations-the five ideals. If there were to be any relations between events which had a claim to be called causal relations, those relations would have to be constructed out of the causal relations between the components of events. So if there were to be causal relations between events they would have to be constructed out of causal relations between objects, but it is difficult to see how such a construction would proceed. The only way to deal with events is via their components, namely the objects and their properties, which events are subordinate to. Unlike a unified object, an event or a set is an entity only because someone insists on regarding it as such. It is possible to say that events 'exist', in the same way that it is possible to say that sets 'exist', provided it is not thereby implied that events as such are real. Events do not exist in the way unified objects exist. Events may also be said to enter into relations with each other. The most obvious relation which events can enter into is that of one event being later in time than another. However, it should be noted that sets also enter into relations with each other, for example one set can be a subset of another. But both the relation of temporal sequence for events and the relation of subsumption for sets are relations which are contingent on how those objects are specified; the existence of such relations there- fore, does not imply that events or sets as such are elements of reality. If the two events can be joined by a worldline then it is commonly assumed that the relation of one being after the other could be causally significant. However, there cannot be a causal relation between them as the earlier event cannot interact with the later event. Were one event to produce another it would have to create it; this is clearer on that view of the world which regards bare events as the basic building blocks. An event has as its components certain objects and properties, or on the bare event view just properties. We have described certain relations which are productive of properties; these relations, therefore, have an excellent title to be called causal relations. But in no case did events emerge as the terms of those productive causal relations. We can, therefore, conclude that events are not the terms of causal relations. The view that events are the terms of causal relations appears to be equivalent to Hume's account of causality, where the causal relation is nothing other than constant conjunction, together with (in some versions) antecedence and contiguity. As Hume's ontology is an ontology of impressions,34 his account of causality is understandable as it is not clear how one impression could produce the next one. In contrast to Hume, our five ideals of causality can only be understood in terms of relations 34 Cf. Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, I, IV, V. Concerning perceptions he says 'They are, therefore, substances, as far as this definition explains a substance.'</page><page sequence="21">The Causal Relation and its Terms 549 which are true interactions-which are productive, which involve depen- dency, and which should therefore be called causal relations. One reason the problem of causality is difficult is that language and ordinary thought lead us to suppose that there are objects such as a,b,c,d, ... which are causes and effects and that there are relations between them which are causal relations. It is further supposed that causes and effects occur in causal chains: a causes b, b causes c, and so on. Both Russell and Lucas have suggested that this picture has to be modified. Events are appealing as causes and effects since they are at least Fregean objects and they are easily arranged into chains. The main problem with events is that there is no causal relation between them. Objects, as we have shown, can enter into causal relations; but the problem with objects is that it is difficult to see them as causes and effects in the hoped for chain of causes and effects. Objects are, however, sometimes spoken of as causes but not as effects.35 Suppose one object a causes another b to change direction. Everyone will agree with the statement that 'object a causes object b to change direction'. But the statement cannot be understood as a statement about a causal relation between object a and object b, nor as a statement about a causal relation between two events. It is not a statement of the form aRb at all. It is true that there is a causal relation between the objects a and b; it is an example of a force relation. And a statement to the effect that there is a force relation between a and b would have the form aRb. But this is a different statement. If there were no causal relation between objects a and b there would be no change in direction; and moreover, there is no other relation which is relevant to the change in direction. Nevertheless, the statement 'object a causes object b to change direction' is not equivalent to a statement that there is a causal relation between objects a and b. The statement 'object a causes object b to change direction' has to be left as it is. It cannot be analysed as a statement about a special sort of object such as a 'changing of direction'. In the same way statements about truth conditions in certain theories of meaning are not to be analysed as statements about special sorts of objects. Truth conditions are not even to be understood as being arbitrary objects; it would do nothing to help a theory of meaning. Similarly, to introduce events as special sorts of objects, (even arbitrary objects), such as 'the event of object b changing direction', does not help our understanding of such statements from an ontological point of view. What is significant ontologically are objects, their properties and causal relations between objects. In our example the only relation which is significant as far as causality goes is the force relation between a and b. If anyone should think that there is some other relation 35 Very often it is more than a single object which is thought of as the cause, see section 3 particularly the discussion of ideal (3).</page><page sequence="22">550 Andrew Newmar, which holds between events which is causally significant, let them say what it is.36 Department of Philosophy ANDREW NEWMAN University of Tulsa Tulsa, OK 741o4 USA 36 We cannot say that 'the state of affairs of aFb' caused 'the change in direction of object b' as there is no causal relation between the two specified events.</page></plain_text>
