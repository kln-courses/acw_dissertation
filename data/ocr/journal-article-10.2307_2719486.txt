Confucius and other early thinkers thought highly enough of the art of poetry to recommend its study to their disciples and even to cite specific poems.' But in speaking of poetry they emphasized theme and affect rather than compositional skill. This set of attitudes is exemplified in Analects 3.20: fF1:IMIffiT r4, A-iiiT6f ("The Master said: The Ode 'Guan ju' is joyful but not wanton, mournful but not wounding"). The value of the poem lies in the sentiments it expresses (or is thought to express). In making a case for the importance of a related art form, the "Record of Mu- sic" (ca. 200 B.C.) translates music entirely into emotional terms: i' t("heto of a0(fP. welt-ger aRge tareft. .pe . aceful d jo yoas:t ("The tones of a well-governed age are peaceful and joyous: its A first version of this paper was presented to the Harvard Premodern China Seminar in April, 1996.

The way of sounds and tones and that of government converge' ").2 With their exclusive focus on affective outcomes, the philosophers and ritual specialists left artistic workmanship to the craftspeople. Thus literary criticism in the technical sense cannot really claim a pedigree reaching back to the sages. In the last three centuries, this has come to be seen as a weakness, as works such as the Shi jing (Book of Odes) have become objects of study for philologists instead of moralists. An obligatory gesture in the philological study of the Shi jing-a gesture repeated again and again from Zheng Qiao S and Wang Bo IlEtr in the Song dynasty to the twentieth-century "doubt- ers of antiquity" -is to pronounce the Odes adequate to their own interpretation. Moral reading is still possible under these condi- tions, but it must justify itself with verbal evidence; from the point of view that takes the text as primary, the discussion of poetry exclu- sively in terms of presumed emotional effect is arbitrary and un- grounded. A division of labor subsists today between readers whose interest is in the poems' literary properties and those whose reading is directed toward the poems' cultural influence: the first group of readers has little time for the Confucian interpretative manner, the second group frequently expounds and affirms it.3 And yet, it may be asked, are these divergences true to the milieu in which both the poems and their earliest interpretations arose? Is it only in the realm of ethical habitus that "the way of sounds and tones" and "the way of governing" meet? Is a more technical poet- ics (as opposed to a morality that cites art as example) simply impos- sible in the world of the Book of Odes? To propose a different relation between form and ethos, I should first like to consider a pair of passages from the classical period.

The gentleman harmonizes with others but does not become identical to them.

Har- mony is that which matures and produces things; sameness, correspondingly, is un- able to ensure their ongoing reproduction. When unlike is joined to unlike, the result is called harmony: thus [whatever is ruled by the principle of] harmony can enjoy prosperity and endure, so that things find their proper place. But if sameness is added to sameness, exhaustion is reached and matters are at an end.... For this reason, when the kings of antiquity sought wives, they took them from clans other than their own; when they sought wealth, they took it from outlying regions; when they selected their ministers, they preferred those who were skilled remonstrators and able to use a variety of exempla in persuading. All this shows their zeal in the matter of harmony and sameness. When there is but one sound, none will hear it; when there is but one kind of material, pattern is absent; when there is but one kind of taste, there is no sweetness;5 when there is but one kind of example, there is no persuasion. The [Zhou] king is about to cast off harmony such as I have de- scribed it and settle for mere sameness.6 4 Analects 13.23. D. C.

They dis- cuss acts and relations in society-gentlemanly conduct, marrying, tribute, public remonstrance, and the bond between ruler and advi- sor. But their maxims of what makes for good and bad action on all these levels are phrased as if a tacit understanding about aesthetic order were somehow prior to the standards of success and failure in the domains of ritual, the family, economics, and government. These passages express approval for ways of acting that exhibit balance, alternation, proportion, even integration of contrary quali- ties; they suggest that kingly behavior can be evaluated in terms of a rule of taste, independently of aims or results. The phrase he er bu tong describes how the noble person acts, not what he does or why. It is a rule, but one that is neither moral nor utilitarian-rather a rule of good form. Early classical poetry, as we shall see, displays similar concerns, and (pace Confucius) not only through subject and tone. I contend that the formal properties of Shijing poems are inseparable from pat- terns of behavior-that the organization of their rhymes and stan- zas is one disregarded medium wherein music and governance "con- verge. " READING, SYMMETRY, AND ASYMMETRY The characteristics of the wise king described in the Guo yu pas- sage are on show in almost all poems of the Shiljing. Rhymed stan- zaic poetry is structured by recurrent similarities that are not per- fect repetitions; an apt rhyme is a case of he er bu tong. But is rhyme merely aural patterning? What is its influence on content, its struc- turing power? If it is not form for form's sake (as one imagines the gentleman's sense of correct behavior could not have been), what does it influence outside of itself? To begin answering these questions, we shall enlist a Shi jing poem and a well-informed premodern reader. The poem is "Jiu mu" OR* (#4), and the reader is Wang Xianqian TEAR (1842- 1918). (After each rhyming character I insert the modern Mandarin pronunciation and the archaic pronunciation as reconstructed by Karlgren. For the sake of convenience, I will occasionally refer to words of the text by their modern Mandarin readings. Rhyming words are italicized in the English translation.)</page><page sequence="5">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 523 US$,k% [lei, liwar] ;5. W/_1J8T-, ,lf. [sui, sniwar] t'.

Its first stanza lays down the pattern followed, almost to the letter, by the succeeding two stanzas. Most of the words in any stanza appear at the same places in the other stanzas: indeed it is only the rhyming words that are not prede- termined by stanza 1. The rhymes stand out as the thing that is different (bu tong), the variable among the constants. And yet rhyme sets limits to difference: rhyming words must share a vowel, a final, and (because of the high degree of repetition in the verses which con- tain rhymes) a grammatical category. They thus display he. Each stanza consists of two pairs of two verses each. The first pair of verses describes the downward-bending trees and the vines 7 I have based my translations (with frequent modifications) on Bernhard Karlgren, The Book of Odes (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1950). I have taken rhymes from the same source, and also from Karlgren, Grammata Serica Recensa (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1957). The purpose is merely to provide an approximate indica- tion of the sounds. For a more technical discussion, see William H. Baxter III, "Zhou and Han Phonology in the Shyjing," William G. Boltz and Michael G. Shapiro, eds., Studies in the Historical Phonology of Asian Languages (Amsterdam and Philadelphia: Benjamins, 1991), pp. 1-34.</page><page sequence="6">524 HAUN SAUSSY growing near them; the second pair of lines brings a change in sub- ject and grammatical mode, expressing wishes for the lord's happi- ness. Similarity dominates in the relation between stanzas, while each stanza is internally split between the themes of its first and sec- ond pairs of verses. Thus "Jiu mu" establishes two areas of difference within a largely repetitive structure: the choice of rhyme words and the thematic dis- continuity between lines 2 and 3 of each stanza. Interpretation must seize on those areas. The Qing editor Wang Xianqian, in his vario- rum commentary Shi sanjia yi jishu '-*A L, builds an elegant reading out of precisely those slight differences. "The poem be- gins," he says, "by wishing that the lord may attain 'peace'; the mid- dle stanza wishes him 'greatness'; and the last stanza, in wishing him 'completion,' takes the theme a step further. Such is the orderly progression of the poem."'8 Wang's reading testifies to the pressure of form on content. Without the regularity of stanzaic structure, there would be no lexical reason to take sui, jiang and cheng in quite this climactic way. Wang takes the change of rhyming verbs to imply a gradation among the propositions voiced in the successive stanzas: difference, however tightly limited by formal constraints, now comes under a thematic rule of "orderly progression." This way of reading is well buttressed by Shi jing precedent: other poems that build their arguments into a similar shape are, just to mention a few, "Zhong si" AVi (#5), "Tao yao" WI (#6), "Tu zhi" it (#7), "Fu yi" ; (#8), "Que chao" (#12), "Cao chong" V: (#14), "Biao you mei" NPRO (#20), "Cai ge" R-X (#72), "Shi jiu" P914, (#152). By discerning a steady intensification in the series sui zhi- jiang zhi-cheng zhi, Wang Xianqian establishes parallels and equiva- lences beyond the obvious, a commonality presiding over differ- ence; he thus becomes a collaborator in the formation of the poem. Wang's reading allows us to say that the sui of the first stanza had to come first, the jiang of the last stanza had to come second, and the cheng of the last stanza had to come last. Wang's reading concen- 8 Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjia yi jishu (Shisanjing Qing ren zhushu series; Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1987), p. 34. A progression from "jiang" to "cheng" also occurs in stanzas 2 and 3 of "Quechao" M (#12); such progression may have been a standard element of poetically- expressed wishes and blessings. I discuss typical rhymes below.</page><page sequence="7">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 525 trates on the fourth-line rhyme words, because that is where the clearest differentiation of meaning is to be found amid the repetition of synonyms and near-synonyms. Difference is this reading's condi- tion of possibility, and it introduces new asymmetries of its own in making jiang more emphatic than sui, and cheng more so than jiang. But those differences operate within the larger context of a narrative progression; they are accounted for and integrated. Wang thus achieves thematic continuity-a primary goal of all reading. But this unity comes at the price of introducing yet another form of non-equivalence, one left unmentioned in his commentary. The poem's most important juncture, in Wang's reading, is the choice of the closing rhyme-word of each stanza, the word express- ing that stanza's particular wish on behalf of the lord. That word becomes the stanza's center and focus. The brighter the light cast on the fourth-line rhyme-words, however, the fainter the contribu- tion of the second-line rhyme-words (lei zi-Ihuang zhi-rong zhi). Wang cannot do anything with the various attitudes of vines and trees; they lead to no thematic synthesis; they are merely decorative or accompanying elements, or so we may interpret Wang's silence concerning them. We might certainly try to see the verbs as show- ing a step-by-step intensification in the "vegetable love" of the vines for their tree, and correlate this to the increasingly hearty wishes for the lord; but the fact that Wang has not seen fit to do so tells us that, for this representative of Shi jing scholarship at its traditional best, such anthropomorphism would be excessive. As the second-verse rhyming words fall from view, so too does the discontinuity between the opening verses (the tree theme) and the closing verses (the lord theme). Is the relation between opening verses and closing verses a hollow one? Is it a mere convention or an expedient of rhyme? A stronger reading would answer these questions in the negative. If, as Roman Jakobson memorably suggested, the specific busi- ness of the "poetic function" is to establish equivalences, then "Jiu mu" is a very poetic piece of poetry indeed and Wang Xian- qian a highly poetic reader.9 But the poetry does not emerge from 9 RomanJakobson, "Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics," in Thomas A. Sebeok, ed., Style in Language (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1960), pp. 350-377. On repetition, especially stanzaic repetition, in the Shijing, see WeiJiangong V4 , "Geyao biaoxian fa zhi zui yao- jin zhe-chongzou futa" f in Gu Jiegang MATINU et al.,</page><page sequence="8">526 HAUN SAUSSY equivalence per se: neither perfect repetition nor unmediated differ- ence encourages interpretation. What the poem mostly gives us is similarity, identity, recurrence; Wang makes a decision about the relative importance of the parts and establishes among the near- identical stanzas a one-way path of development, a dissymmetry, a non-equivalence to balance the obvious equivalences. The interpre- tation of the poem succeeds, thanks to that labor of differentiation. Both Wang's reading and the problem it leaves untouched show that the form of "Jiu mu" proposes a series of puzzles to the reader. The poem involves its readers in the task of making analogies out of differences and gradations out of repetitions. Its rhymes and recurrences build up in the reader's mind an aural and thematic simulacrum of the rule he er bu tong. UNSERIOUS CORRELATIONS? Wang Xianqian's interpretation of "Jiu mu" -and our reading of that interpretation's unintegrated remainder-assumed that the role of parallelism in Shijing poems is to suggest correlations. Poems composed in the dualistic form of "Jiu mu" -where in each stanza a pair of statements about trees is followed and answered by a pair of statements about a nobleman-establish thematic equivalence on the basis of rhythmic and aural equivalence. Seasoned readers of the Shijing develop an ear for the implications of such parallelism. But some poems seem to anticipate that habit of interpretation, and deliberately to frustrate it-to leave behind remainders that not even the most industrious readers can dissolve. The semantic disor- der created by such poems can serve to emphasize the symmetry and measured progress of "Jiu mu." "Sang zhong" A4i (#48), opens each stanza with a plant name in the first rhyming place: [goRng [tang, d'ang] , 5M [sxiang, Xiang] M X[jiang, kiang] t.SRM[zhong, tio^ng],.

The traditional commentators strongly disapprove of this irreverent lit- tle poem. For them, "Sang zhong" stands out in the Shi jing corpus as a poem of "satire, " made into a mocking parade of the immorali- ty that obtained in the ancient state of Wei. In his paraphrase of the poem's first stanza, Zheng Xuan XA (127-200) displays some of the same readerly instincts as Wang Xianqian. He tries to find a log- ical interrelation among the rhyme words, linking plant name, place, and opportunities for amorous adventure. "Where to pluck the dodder?" Zheng asks. "One will certainly [,Z] go to the village 10 Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjiayijishu, pp. 230-33; Karlgren, The Book of Odes, p. 31. I retain the translation of xiang as "village" (rather than Karlgren's "south") because Zheng Xuan's annotation seems to require it.</page><page sequence="10">528 HAUN SAUSSY by the Mei. As much as to say that lustful and corrupt persons will certainly [%Y6] hasten to the capital of the state of Wei: [the poem] condemns [the duke of] Wei as a lord of lust and corruption.""" On that reading, the links between dodder-plucking and the region of the Mei are logical and necessary, as is the parallel between that in- stance of necessity and the implied link between licentiousness and the lord of Wei. If one is seeking dodder, one will go to the places where dodder is to be found; if one is seeking illicit sex, one will go to the state of Wei. Zheng Xuan's reading is therefore correlative: the stanza's opening statements (about dodder) set a pattern for its following statements (about the availability of Elder Daughter Jiang). But the succeeding stanzas cause us to question this reason- ing. To read the articulation of the rhyme-words as an aspect of the speaker's expression of satisfaction (rather than of Zheng Xuan's disapproval), the progression from dodder to village to Elder Daugh- terJiang takes on a new meaning with the second and third stanzas, where parallel adventures are recounted involving the elder daugh- ters of the Yi and Yong clans. Does this sequence confirm the neces- sity of connections between the setting and the action of the poem, or rather their looseness? The narrator might be drawing a parallel, saying: "I know where to get what I want, whether it be edible plants or a partner in dalliance"; he might also be pointing to a difference, saying: "For dodder, wheat, or greens, you need to look in specific places; but as for high-born female company, I find it wherever I go." The three invariant lines that narrate the conclu- sion of each amorous episode confirm the second reading. Phoneti- cally this group of three lines echoes the rhyme of the first stanza, but it undergoes no change when attached to stanzas 2 and 3, although the leading rhyme of those stanzas varies: as far as rhyme is concerned, the three-line coda is a self-contained unit. Taken as imitative form, the combination of introductory lines, answering lines, and boasting conclusion tells us that the speaker meets with automatic and predictable success wherever he goes, a success that has little to do with either the individual high-born ladies named or the plant and place names that rhyme with theirs. The fact that the women are interchangeable-that they are all fitted into a repeating " Zheng Xuan, cited in Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjia yijishu, p. 23 1.</page><page sequence="11">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 529 stanza form-makes the opening call with its enumeration of plants and places mere decoration and incident. Zheng's tradition may be right in saying that dodder grows by the village, wheat to the north of the Mei, and so on. Zheng Xuan wants the speaker to say that, in order to carry out his designs, he can only go to the capital of Wei, but the speaker's words taken as a whole say that he might as well have gone anywhere and met with identical success. Zheng wants to use the opening lines as establishing a context for what follows; the speaker by his verbal actions tells us that context is indifferent. Thus the composer's casual "picking" of plant names as stanza- openers appears almost an irreverence towards the form: the plant names may or may not be meaningful rhymes, but even if they were so they would not introduce any meaningful difference in the lines about the women. This satirical insight, however, dawns on us only after we have seen enough stanzas to judge the relative weight of sameness and difference in the poem. These two examples show how the articulation of rhyme is in- tegral to the articulation of themes. Moreover, rhyme and theme can march together or play off each other in counterpoint. Both poems achieve complexity with wondrous economy. Much of their language is pure repetition, and what varies from stanza to stanza is really the minimum that must vary for a stanza to count as new in a rhyming poem: namely, the rhyme-words. Our readings confirm that a great deal can be done with so little variation: the behavior of the rhyming words directs the interpretation of the whole poem. EXCHANGES The "Jiu mu" stanza (roughly identical with the first four lines of each stanza of "Sang zhong") calls forth some generic questions and social implications. Its four lines are split in two: first come two lines about trees and vines, then two lines about the nobleman's fe- licity. Rhyme bridges the thematic difference; the parts of the split stanza both end with a rhyming word. Now this stanza form-an opening section of two lines and a thematically distinct answering section of two lines, with rhymes at the ends of lines 2 and 4-is one of the most common in the Guofeng section of the Shiijing. In such a stanza, the first lines are typically devoted to the description of</page><page sequence="12">530 HAUN SAUSSY natural scenery or objects. These are the famous xing X ("evoca- tions," "stimuli," "beginnings"), first isolated for discussion by the Mao zhuan commentary of early Han date."2 For later theorists such as Liu Xie MA, the split stanza and the xing practically define the Shiijing corpus as a genre."3 But what is a xing? The Mao zhuan used the term exclusively to flag opening statements that are to be taken as tropes, not as main topics. Historians of literature (again following Liu Xie) and comparative critics treat the xing as a type of image, usually defined in some relationship to metaphor."4 These approaches to the xing define it in semantic, rhetorical, and thematic terms. But now, by attending to stanza construction, we restore to the xing its formal and verbal privilege of fixing the rhyme for the poem. The first rhyme-word, however, emerges from a thematically mar- ginal part of the poem: as we saw, both Wang Xianqian and Zheng Xuan found it a challenge to connect the opening verses of stanzas to their closing verses. It is the closing rhyme in each stanza that carries the greatest thematic weight. On it depend the narrative continuity of "Jiu mu" and the satirical repetitiveness of "Sang zhong." The first rhyme-word announces the second, but cannot substitute for it; it would go against a deep Shiijing convention to rearrange such a stanza so that lines 3 and 4 preceded lines 1 and 2. The phonetic equivalence of the rhyming-words masks their themat- 12 For a recent study of this commentary, see Martin Svensson, Hermenutica/Hermetica Serica (Ph.D. diss., Stockholm University, 1996). 13 Liu Xie's "Bi xing" kt# chapter contains most of the literary-historical signals that at- tach the xing specifically to the Shijing: the definition of the trope by Master Mao, its source in qing j? (feeling) rather than in 1i 3 (reasoning), the hierarchical difference between its natu- ral and social strata, and the disappearance of xing as a feature of poetry after the Han; see his Wen xin diao long 1 ed. Zhou Zhenfu ,F9139 (Taipei: Liren chubanshe, 1984), p. 677. Of course, Liu did not base himself on a statistical analysis of verse-patterns in the Shi jing. 14 Many critics have attempted to isolate xing as a specific type of imagery, usually by differentiating it from bi it andfu PA. See Arthur Waley, "The Book of Changes," BMFEA 5 (1933): 121-42; William McNaughton, "The Composite Image: Shy jing Poetics," JAS 83 (1963): 92-103; Ye Shan, "Shijing Guofeng de caomu he shi de biaoxianjiqiao" g40 gA, :@:7cgSt?9,Xg, 11-45, in Ke Qingming ,*1 and Lin Mingde . eds., Zhong- guo gudian wenxueyanjiu congkan: Shige zhi bu p @ F;R fI n (Taipei: Juliu chubanshe, 1977), pp. 19-20; Pauline Yu, The Reading of Imagery, Chapter 1. My contention is not that imagery is irrelevant, only that it operates under conditions set by rhyme and stan- za.</page><page sequence="13">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 531 ic inequality. This thematic weighting creates a difference between performance and interpretation. Although, in the experience of the listener, the first rhyme seems to determine the second rhyme, from the composer's point of view the main subject, and accordingly the second rhyme, dominates. The composer of a Guo feng stanza no doubt settled on the concluding rhyme first and then selected an ap- propriate xing that would deliver the needed opening rhyme. The xing is not the subject of the poem, but the poem pretends that it is, at least for the duration of the rhyme. The prominence of the xing and the leading rhyme-word is intended ironically, or, to lapse into technical language, chiastically;15 they are not causes but pretexts whose presence in the poem depends entirely on their apparent con- sequences, their rhyming partners in the fourth line."6 Rhyme and xing between them organize a stanza as a network of counterpointed forms of prominence-apparent and real, imme- diate and delayed. With its distinctions of topic and importance, too, the split stanza parallels the difference between the manifest con- tent of many Guofeng songs-manual tasks, rural scenes, seasonal markers-and the situations in which we see them first recited and interpreted, namely, courts and embassies."7 The ancient style of practical interpretation has often been considered far-fetched and irresponsible, but the stanza with a xing opening gives it poetic prece- dent. In such a stanza, high and low are put before the listener as symmetrical and parallel units; it is interpretation that must empha- size their difference as thematic fields and give the second half of the 15 On chiasmus in Shijing, see Qian Zhongshu AZO, Guan zkhi bian Rgs (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1979), 1:65-66. 16 Ye Shan VAR (i.e., C. H. Wang) cites a conclusive example of such construction, "Huang niao" *Al; (#131). The last rhyme-word of each stanza is the name of an individual and the opening rhymes are plant names. The poet would not have been free to alter the names of the individuals commemorated, but the plant names could be chosen to suit the needs of rhyming. See "Shijing Guofeng de caomu he shi de biaoxian jiqiao," pp. 19-20. 17 On the ancient practice of reciting Shijing poems in public settings, see Gu jiegang, "Shi jing zai Chunqiu Zhanguojian de diwei," Gu shi bian 3:309-67. The standard account of the origin of the poems of the Guofeng makes them out to be folk songs collected and preserved by court officials eager to document popular opinion. This cannot be verified, of course, and twentieth-century skeptics have tried to show that the presently existing texts have clearly been adapted to courtly purposes and tastes.

In the same manner, poems on the pattern of "Jiu mu" throw out a natural, agricultural object, and then, as if by internal dialogue or chorus, respond with a worked-over, precious, noble concern. But is this a satisfactory ending-merely to say that exchange takes place? No, continues the speaker of "Mu gua": "No, not as requital, but meaning I would love her for ever" (as Arthur Waley has it) W1I$ [pog] tt, AW&lt;T [Xog] t. This takes the exchange out of the realm of reciprocity or reasonable commerce but confirms the rhyming relation, the equiva- lence in a poetic system, of quince and pendant (kwa-kio; the "Mu gua" stanza rhymes aabb). "Mu gua" analogizes analogy itself. In it a lopsided exchange of objects achieves symmetry through the compensating echoes of verse language. The joint ingenuity of poet and reader, anticipated in the unusual self-commentary of the narra- tor of "Mu gua," consists in finding ways to turn rhyme into rea- son, coincidental relations into harmonious and necessary ones. The poem enlists us in its project. It offers us rhymes and we return the compliment with reasons. VIRTUOUS CIRCLES What rhyme does in the Shi jing is, then, to bind together and identify things that under other circumstances tend to fly apart-na- ture and social life; gift and unequal counter-gift; peasantry and aristocracy. Rhyme is a bond, a semantic glue. "Ji zui" Kw (#247) shows rhyme following the gestures of social reciprocity step by step. In it the recipients of favor narrate the bestower's kindness, and seal their description with a pious wish in return: KRSU?M, K Ult{ [de, tak]. , k [fu, pijik] ("We are drunk with wine, / sated with your virtue. / Ten thousand years to our lord, / may his great fortune be increased! "). De andfu (virtue and felicity) rhyme as do a cause and its answering effect. The bond, both logical</page><page sequence="15">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 533 and acoustic, between the two statements underscores the power of gift-relationships. 8 Appropriately, the symmetry and echo of an xaxa quatrain display to social actors the pattern of a perfect exchange, the action utterly acknowledged and reciprocated in the reaction. The rhyme of de andfu, in this context, takes on quasi-magical im- plications: to paraphrase, "May your virtue bring on felicity as smoothly as a leading rhyme brings on an answering rhyme." The rhyming pair of de andfu returns again and again in the Odes, partic- ularly in its dynastic-history sections; see "Tian bao" WR (#166), "Bin zhi chu yan" W;LUR (#220), "Wen Wang" iZlE (#235), "Xia wu" TA (#243), "Zheng min" 2R (#260), some of which are discussed below. Gift-giving relationships, which are personal and almost sacred, should not look too much like unfeeling but necessary mercantile relationships: so, for example, in various cultures the price paid for a gift is a taboo subject, or the return-gift cannot follow too closely on the first gift or must be visibly of a different nature. What if the regular tic-tac of rhyme were to suggest the self-interested symme- try of buying and selling?

I have an honored guest, from the midst of my heart I love him. The bells and drums are set out; all the morning long I drink in acknowledgment of his pledge. The indelicate suggestion that gratitude is merely acknowledgment of value received is here turned aside by putting the narration prin- cipally in the king's hands (insofar as such things can be settled in a language that uses pronouns so sparsely)."9 The verbs of the first stanza are "stores away" (the act of the grateful subject), "reward" (the act of the generous monarch), and "feast" (the continuation of the monarch's generosity). Unlike "Mu gua" or "Ji zui," the poem exhibits an unrelenting stream of gifts, and does so for six lines per stanza (three rhyme-echoes) rather than the usual four lines. The king's loyal subject has nothing to do here but show his respectful thanks by "storing away" the symbolic bow, and then, in successive stanzas, "carrying it off" and "encasing it." The beneficiary is barred from taking reciprocating action because the very receiving of the gift happens with the opening rhyme-word, the word that the king's voice then answers. The relationships of agen- cy depart some what from the structure of "Jiu mu" and so many other poems on the call-and-response pattern. In those poems the 19 The first two lines of the stanza have long been responsible for uncertainty about the point of view of the narration.

But that then makes the continuation with :t; awkward: in the space of eight characters two different people-a donor and a recipient-would speak in the first person without a clearly marked transition. Zheng Xuan, sensitive to the difficulty, declares that O means "the royal investiture. When a king bestows a lacquered bow [on a noble], he always causes the recipient's meritorious deeds to be set down in a writ of investiture"; see Wang Xianqian, Shi sanjiayijishu, p. 603. Zheng's word-gloss is almost certainly wrong (modern scholars readyan as a verbal adjunct), but the effort shows an early reader's awareness of the importance of speaker's perspective to this noem.</page><page sequence="17">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 535 first rhyme-word appears to initiate the poem's search for balance and closure, but that first rhyme-word eventually is revealed as a mere forerunner of the thematically more important second rhyme- word. In the symmetrical "Ji zui," the gift-giving action initiates the rhyming exchange and the reaction completes the rhyme: the dy- namics of rhyme and of exchange are perfectly in step. But if "Mu gua" had been built on such a pattern, that would suggest that the reason for giving gifts (even so humble a gift as a quince) was to elic- it the more valuable counter-gift; and such a suggestion is especially unwelcome in the context of the bond of king and feudal subject. It becomes necessary for "Tong gong" (just as it was in "Mu gua," but for other reasons) to throw the rhythms of rhyme and exchange out of lock-step. The king's gift therefore happens in line 1, outside the rhyme-system. The subject's reception of the gift in line 2 (in terms of plot, a response or reaction) then initiates a rhyme-series that unfolds in a list of royal bounties, all the more impressive be- cause uncompelled. Rhyme does significant work, and a multiplication and inten- sification of rhyme correspondingly raises the reader's expectations. This occurs in another poem meant to cement social bonds, this time intergenerational ones: "Xia wu" (#243), from the Daya ;kW part of the collection. -FASP09i, fLMT_E [giwang]. 3GER EAX g [klia ng].

"Xia wu" contains much more rhyme than a Shi jing poem usually requires: not only do the even lines of each stanza rhyme, but most of the odd-numbered lines rhyme as well, either with each other or with lines in neighboring stanzas. The sound-patterning is made denser still by the repetitions of lines and phrases from stanza to stanza (here indicated by points) and by the continuation of the same, or nearly the same, rhyme throughout stanzas 2, 3 and 4 (from g 'iog to b 'iik) .21 Most conspicuously, the last line of stanzas 1, 2, 3 and 5 is carried over as a whole to form the first line of the fol- lowing stanza. To what end this copious display of rhyming resources? The story told by the poem is one of dynastic continuity across generations, or, to quote the Little Preface, "the succession 21 For the details, see Karlgren, The Book of Odes, p. 197.

The use of rhyme to mark lines 1 and 3 as well as 2 and 4, and the echoing continuation of the same rhyme-sound for twelve verses are ji wen in another sense: "perpetuating the traces." The chain-linked stanza (known to European poets by its Malay name, pantoum) gives an auditory analogue of the past generations reced- ing while leaving behind traces of their presence-the perfect stanza for a filial and precedent-minded dynasty.23 There are breaks in this pattern-the openings of stanzas 4 and 5-but even there, words and lines from earlier verses persist to bridge the gaps. And a critic unwilling to accept that anything is ac- cidental might observe that the first break occurs just as the poem's narration has finished bringing us up to date, so to speak, with the installation of the present sovereign. Stanza 4 interrupts the dense rhyming of the previous stanzas: its first line ends (like the first line of stanza 1) in a non-rhyming word. Line 2 of stanza 4 returns to the rhyme-series just abandoned, and the rhyme recurs in lines 3 and 4 as well. Stanza 5 shows three rhymes for four lines. When stanza 5's last line is repeated as the first line of stanza 6, the poem has weathered its succession-crisis and reestablished the abab-bcbc pattern that emerged so unexpectedly in stanza 2. In the bipartite stanza-form exemplified by "Jiu mu," every rhyme-word is either an opening or a closing rhyme by stanzaic posi- tion, and this position correlates with thematic prominence. "Xia wu" confounds these expectations. Its first stanza obeys the xaxa structure: lines 2 and 4 end in resounding rhymes, the final sounds of lines 1 and 3 are quite far apart. But from the second stanza on- wards, a structural transformation takes place: the first line of stan- za 2 repeats the last line of stanza 1; line 3 of stanza 2 resumes the rhyme of line 1. The rhyme-sound that, in the xaxa pattern, would have expired at the close of the first stanza continues to echo through the following stanza. Its position at line 1 of the new stanza normally leads to no rhyming consequences; unexpectedly, 22 This interpretation of the phraseji wen departs from the Zheng Xuan tradition: for back- ing, see Chen Huan t, Shi Mao shi zhuan shu -F- e (rpt., Taipei: Xuesheng shuju, 1986), 23.26b. 23 The repeated line concluding one stanza and beginning another also occurs in "Wen Wang" (#235), "Da ming" (#236), and "Ji zui" (#247), all from the Daya.</page><page sequence="20">538 HAUN SAUSSY however, line 3 provides an answering rhyme to line 1. The pan- toum form of "Xia wu" overrides the distinction between open- ing rhymes and closing rhymes; between odd and even lines; and between the beginning and ending halves of a stanza. It takes rhymes and line-positions out of their determined roles, thereby suspending stanzaic time. Rhymed Ski jing stanzas are little dramas. Will the answering rhyme complete a phonetic circuit-which is also a circuit of ex- change, of inheritance, of affective ties, of cause and result, of cultur- al memory? The poems of the Shi jing usually grant the wishes they excite: their beauty is most often that of regularity. "Xia wu" com- plicates the terms of rhyme's mediation. In the two-part stanza, rhyme declares equivalence among non-identicals or affirms bonds among non-equals. One form of inequality or asymmetry for which rhyme compensates is temporal ordering. Rhyme-words, like all words in linear, time-bound speech, appear not simultaneously but in sequence; yet rhyme requires us to hold suspended in our memo- ry the echo of the earlier rhyme-word until its fellow has answered it. In "Xia wu," however, a single rhyme word can be both the following and the leading member of a rhyming-series. The time specific to rhyme is thus no longer calculated by reference to a single point of symmetry (the midpoint of the bipartite stanza). In their blending of time-positions, the rhymes of "Xia wu" perfectly lay out the impossible task of being an adequate successor. THE LIFE OF RHYMES OUTSIDE THE POEM Our reading has moved from examples that showed rhyme as a building block of structure to examples that showed rhyme operat- ing to mediate or dissolve some of those same structures. In order to do that, we took the individual poem as the unit of analysis. Rhyme certainly contributes to the organization and stabilization of a poem-as when it bonds words and statements into a memorable or beautiful pattern. But the single poem is not the only context in which a rhyme may be significant. Groupings or families of rhyme- words so often recur in Shi jing poems-to be more precise, within certain types of poem and theme-that they come to seem an expected, perhaps even obligatory, feature of the sub-genre to</page><page sequence="21">RHYME IN THE BOOK OF ODES 539 which the poem belongs. One of these rhyme-clusters has already surfaced in our examination of "Xia wu." This is the system of rhymes including "tak" ft (virtue), "saik" A (model), "siag" T, (thoughtful), "tsak" RIJ (rule), "b'iiik" H19 (serve). "Ji zui" con- tributed another member to the rhyming-group, "p'iiik" i (for- tune). Several poems share a large enough number of these words that it makes sense to speak of them as a thematically related set within the larger field of phonetically possible rhymes on the same syl- lable. To invoke one of the set is to invite the others; yet the set's thematic associations do not depend on the presence of any one member. Let us call these "typical rhymes."24 "Zheng min" (#260) reads in part: X ,j h4t4ljr [tsak]. J f [tak] #WP9;tM, [tak], tPXV%Aq [tsak], A+ff~itE [siak], J.^ [giak], -N311ViA [sfik], 1NZWE7J [liak]. Heaven produced the numerous people, there are living things and there are rules. The people, grasping constant [principles], cherish this fine virtue. The virtue of Zhong Shanfu takes kindness and generosity as its rule. Fine are his bearing and countenance, he is scrupulous and respectful. Ancient precedent is for him the pattern, majesty and dignity are the objects of his effort. (The presence of near-nonsense in the translation indicates that we are dealing with a specialized and ingrown vocabulary of praise.) These verses add to the cluster of rhyme-fellows "giak" X (wing, helper; here used as a doubled intensifier-word)25 and "liak" ii (strength). Other poems employ, as rhymes to rhyme-words al- ready claimed for this series, "ngia" ' (deportment), "d'iak" i (straight), "kwak" R (kingdom), and "tsiag" -f (son): see "Da 24 In homage to Walter Arend, Typische Szenen bei Homer (Berlin: Weidmann, 1933). 25 For further uses of this rhyming word, see "Yuan yang" * (#216) and "Bai hua" b t (#229).</page><page sequence="22">540 HAUN SAUSSY ming" )tc (#236), "Juan e" %W (#252), "Tang" iM (#255), and "Song gao" (#259). The distribution of typical rhymes is hardly coincidental: the poems with the most rhymes drawn from this set share a thematic core in the characteristic Zhou moral theory of kingship. The ruler who exhibits virtue and expends effort with schol- ars of g6od deportment to wing or aid him will become a pattern for the many states so that all will come to serve him as their Tianzi or Son of Heaven-such is a rough paraphrase of the theory in the lexicon of the most frequent Shi jing rhymes used to express it. A related system of rhymes, also partly visible in "Xia wu," often alternates with the de M, words. This second system includes the words "giwang" IE (king), "diang" t (constant), "kliang" e (capital), "tsiang" M (increase), "piwang" X1 (territory), "miang" p (mandate or fate), "dieng" S (complete), and, still viable as rhyming partners despite the different vowels, "seng" I (give birth), and "nieng" I (pacify).26 "Jiu mu," "Tong gong," and "Ji zui," already discussed above, make glancing references to this second system, which no doubt adds luster to the compliments they make. The dynastic odes "Wen Wang" (#235), "Da ming" (#236) and "Huang yi" 19 (#241) are fine examples of the liberal use of both rhyme-families. "Wen Wang you sheng" :ZEE8$ (#244) opens with a stanza in the key of "wang" FE, following it with an ex- tra rhyme on "ming" *fp and then moving to a nearly-identical rhyme that happens to gather together the sites of King Wen's memorable conquests: :ZiTqh [se1ng], AtWM [s'16ng].

He sought to establish peace, and he viewed its accomplishment. 26 In this connection, note the predominance of "-ang" words at the ends of the clauses of the Guoyu prose passage cited at the top of this essay. Prose so carefully ordered is no doubt to be seen as a halfway house between speech and poetry.

When King Wen received the mandate, these were his martial deeds. He led an attack on Chong and built his city at Feng. Splendid indeed was King Wen! Do the rhyme-words take over and write the poem on their own? Or does the theory of kingship dictate the poetry? To be sure, the poets use these words because these are the words the Chinese lan- guage makes available; many of these words would also occur in a prose document on the same subject. But to treat this vocabulary as nothing more than a set of meaningful terms would be to ignore the power of poetic technique and transmission to shape content and, over time, linguistic usage. It must have been after poetic precedent had assembled and linked these typical rhyme-words that they could have taken on such insistent, symptomatic force, eventually becom- ing obligatory metaphors of royal power and hastening in whole crews to fill out a stanza whenever one of them had been used. Rhymes exist for the sake of poems, of course, but poems can also be written for the sake of their rhymes if the rhymes have somehow acquired sufficient independent power and meaning. The repeated invocation of these rhyme-groups and others like them suggest a further dimension to Shijing rhyming-a dimension that takes us beyond the single poem and confronts us with the tradi- tion as a whole. These rhyme-families invite the speculation that the ability to invoke thematically appropriate rhyme-series would have been part of the equipment of any competent Shi jing com- poser. Once the set had become familiar as a phonetic and thematic unit, their very presence in a poem became consecrating: a poem about sagely kingship that did not include some members of the set would be found wanting. Merely by referring to the right rhymes, the poem participates in an almost magical field of meaning: as a consequence, the structures of parallelism and antithesis are no longer so crucial to a poem's effect (the Da ya and Song , poems generally employ far looser stanzaic organization than the Guofeng). For confirmation of the normative power of this precedent, one might cite the "Anshi fangzhong ge" J!:fth supposedly com- posed by Tangshan furen )IiSk, one of the consorts of Emperor</page><page sequence="24">542 HAUN SAUSSY Gaozu of the Han -i A. This suite of songs displays all the rhyme- clusters just mentioned, in an effort to evoke both the literary and the prestige-conferring qualities of the Daya.27 It is only a small step through time and across the boundaries of genre to observe the same words acting as the decisive game-pieces in philosophical debates about the nature of sovereignty. Rhyme no longer organizes the discourses of Confucius and Mencius, but are they not speaking in words that owe their prominence to a long history of use as rhymes? This brings us full circle, back to the Guoyu and Analects citations that described noble action in terms of its manner rather than its mo- tives or consequences. Attention to the manner was what we found lacking in the early evaluation of poetry and art. Rhyme belongs among the manners, the devices, of composition. Physical proper- ties limit and direct what can be done with materials (one thinks of weaving). Through rhyme, a physical property of most of the poems in the Shiljing corpus, the material, phonetic level of the text com- municates with the thematic level and directs the judgments and attitudes that commanded Confucius's interest in poetry. It cor- responds so closely to the workings of theme, imagery, narration, and pragmatic purpose that it is tempting to see rhyme as the pat- tern for felicity in the broadest domains of the early Chinese aesthet- ic-and how broad those are, the Guo yu speech cited above can show. 27 Lu Qinli ,4 ', ed., Xian Qin Han Weijin Nanbeichao shi ,t* R S,.JL (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1983), pp. 145-47.</page></plain_text>
