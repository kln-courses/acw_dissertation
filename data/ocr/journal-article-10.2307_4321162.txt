This paper contrasts a picoeconomic approach to the explanation of akrasia with Davidson's divided-mind approach and defends the former in a wider context. The distinctive merits of a picoeconomic model of mind lie in the following aspects: First, it relies on a scientifically well-grounded discovery about motivational dynamics of animals for its explanation of preference change, which elucidates or materializes some philosophers' speculations both about the possible mismatch between valuation and motivation and about the relevance of temporal factors to akrasia. Second, it grounds the necessity of endogenous higher-order constraints, expressible in forms of judgment, in an intrapersonal dynamic process of interactive first-order temporary preferences. Thus the motivational basis for the normative construction of the rationality of 'best judgment' can also be illuminated with this model. I. ISSUES ABOUT AKRASIA Weakness of will is not merely a practical problem many people often encounter in their daily life but also a theoretical problem, as Socrates' denial of its very possibility suggests.1 There are some modem versions of the Socratic denial, two of the most important being Donald Davidson's view of the causal sufficiency, and R. M. Hare's view of the logical sufficiency, of one's best judgment of what to do for subsequent action. These two theses of sufficiency can be formulated as follows. Causal Sufficiency: S's judging it best (or intending, deciding, choosing) at t to do A at t is causally sufficient for his doing A at t, provided that he is physically and psychologically able to do so.

If either one of these principles of sufficiency is sound, strict akratic action will not be possible. Since, by definition, akratic action is free, intentional action contrary to the agent's best judgment,2 its very possibility would violate either one of these principles. The arguments of Davidson and Hare for their principles of sufficiency have been carefully examined and rejected by other philosophers, such as David Pears (1982, pp. 33-50, 1984, chapter 9) and Alfred Mele (1987, chapters 2 &amp; 3). Pertinent to arguments of this sort are possible questions about the role and etiology of the agent's best judgment: what kind of best judgment, if there is any, is required for counting an action akratic? Do we have to know the nature of all the relevant processes that in one way or another contribute to the formation of the best judgment involved?3 On the other hand, in addition to the largely stipulatory issue over the mere possibility of weakness of will, there is another and distinct issue of how adequately to explain the actual occurrence of akratic actions if one concedes that there genuinely are such actions. There is a good reason to give sufficient attention to this latter issue. For if such an explanation could be established, then discussions of the possibility of akratic action would either lose its relevance or take on a very different character. And underlying both issues, there is a paradox of irrationality in a broader sense, revealed by Davidson, that challenges us to explain a certain kind of putatively irrational behavior without thereby rendering that very behavior subjectively rational. ('Subjective irrationality' means that from the subject's own point of view, her incontinent action is irrational, even at the moment of intentionally doing it.) II. DAVIDSON'S RESOLUTION: THE PARTITIONING HYPOTHESIS In "Paradoxes of Irrationality," Davidson claims that common vari- eties of irrationality like akratic action can be understood by imagining that the mind is comprised of sub-systems or partitions.</page><page sequence="3">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 229 According to Davidson, the irrationality of akratic action consists in this, that what causes the action is not the reason on which the agent judges it best to act. On Davidson's causal-theoretical notion of reason, one's reason for an action must be also a cause of that action. And, on a revised version of his above sufficiency thesis, one's best judgment, as a reason, to do A should be a sufficient cause of doing A, provided that there is no other interfering, non-reason cause. Therefore, what causes akratic action must be something other than the reason on which one judges it best to act. In order to account for mental causes that are not reasons for the mental states they cause, a hypothesis that the mind has 'two or more semi-autonomous structures' is necessary. "Only by partitioning the mind does it seem possible to explain how a thought or impulse can cause another to which it bears no rational relation" (Davidson, 1982, p. 303). We may call the following statement Davidson's prin- ciple of partitioning: "the breakdown of reason-relations defines the boundary of a subdivision" (1982, p. 304). Two questions can be raised about this principle. One is about its empirical plausibility. Is it really the case, whenever we find no reason relation but only a causal relation between two mental items, that this points to some boundary or division between them? Here is one example that suggests differently. Veronica is afraid of flying. Wishing to get over her fear, she adopts a program of desensitization. Each night, after making herself as comfortable as possible, she imagines that she is flying to visit a friend. After several weeks, her association of images of flying with feelings of comfort has met with considerable success. Veronica is now much less fearful about flying than she had been (Mele, 1987, p. 77). Veronica's acts of imagination contribute causally to the reduction of her fear of flying but are not reasons for the latter. The effect is the intended product of her project and the cause operates in a coherent and intelligible way to generate a predictable result. In this case, and in innumerable other cases which involve no akratic action but nevertheless have intrapsychic non-reason causal relations, it is far from clear what is to be gained by placing mental causes and their effects in different subdivisions. In such cases, talk of a goal- directed functional system (viz., without any partition) seems quite</page><page sequence="4">230 YUJIAN ZHENG appropriate. Mele suspects that the attractiveness the principle of partitioning has for Davidson is due to his not having cast his net widely enough. In his concern to explain irrational action, Davidson overlooks a variety of roles that [mental causes without being reasons] may have in rational behavior (1987, p. 76). The second question about the principle of partitioning concerns the specific explanatory mechanisms required by this principle and the possible new problems or drawbacks they may engender. Davidson himself admits that his partitioning hypothesis "leaves much unexplained, for we want to know why this double struc- ture developed, how it accounts for the action taken," and so on (1982, p. 301). By way of giving substance to Davidson's hypoth- esis, David Pears develops a modified partitioning model. Pears's mental subsystem is built around the nucleus of a wish or desire that one come to hold an irrational belief or do an irrational action and is organized in the following manner. Although it is a separate center of agency within the whole person, it is, from its own point of view, entirely rational. It wants the main system to form the irrational belief and it is aware that it will not form it, if the cautionary belief is allowed to intervene. So with perfect rationality it stops its intervention (Pears, 1984, p. 87). However, after carefully working out a specific mechanism for the explanation of akratic action according to Davidson's prin- ciple as well as Pears's supplement, John Heil concludes that "for its apparent straightforwardness, Davidson's conception of partitioning, when pushed, seems gratuitously complex" (1989, p. 580). And Mele, again, using a certain representative case, argues that Pears's subsystem agency is unnecessarily anthropomorphic, compared with a conceivable alternative explanatory scheme (1987, pp. 81-83). In short, an ad hoc and cumbersome account is bound to raise suspicions, especially when other more natural and less cumbersome accounts are available. III. DISPARITY BETWEEN VALUATION AND MOTIVATION Heil attempts a "simpler, far less cumbersome account" for weak- ness of will, one that rejects the bifurcation of the domains of practical and epistemic reason. Consider this example of Heil's:</page><page sequence="5">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 231 I have a strong desire to insult Wayne, a student whom I have detected yawning surreptitiously during a lecture on self-control. I judge that, all things considered, it would be best not to insult Wayne, nevertheless I succumb to my urge and do it (1989, p. 578). Instead of invoking partitioning to locate a mental cause and a corre- sponding effect and somehow making a reason-blocking boundary between them, Heil offers a simpler explanation. My desire to insult Wayne enjoys motivational clout disproportionate to my assessment of it. In judging what I have most reason to do, then, I assign the desire a relatively low ranking. The desire in question turns out, however, to possess strength disproportionate to its standing and, as a result, I act akratically, viz., against my considered better judgment (Heil, 1989, p. 581). What is notable here is that there can be a conceptual distinction between the motivational strength possessed by a given desire and its evaluative standing. If this distinction is not merely a conceptual possibility but reflects, at least sometimes, psychological reality, we can surely appeal to it in accounting for akratic actions without, like Davidson, appealing to mental division. The account would simply consist of pointing out that the agent's best judgment is based on his valuation of the objects of his desires, and one's valuation need not match the motivational force of the desire which is causally responsible for the akratic action concerned.4 The simple move associated with this distinction here, however, may seem too easy to make one free of unsettling questions, such as why philosophers like Davidson did not take the move, or take it seriously, if it should so readily suggest a promising account for akratic actions. Is it not a rather plain fact in our practical life that the strengths of our desires for certain objects are, at least normally, in line with our evaluation of these objects? For those who are impressed with such a fact, they may find entirely acceptable the following principle Davidson has advanced: P2. If an agent judges that it would be better to do x than to do y, then he wants to do x more than he wants to do y. (1980, p. 23) If we take "want" here as indicating motivation or its ilk, then the principle states so close a link between one's valuation and his corre-</page><page sequence="6">232 YUJIAN ZHENG sponding motivation as not to allow any exception. On the other hand, nevertheless, even for those who would allow, or not want to commit themselves to excluding, possible exceptions to the above link, they might not be automatically granted a free hand in attrib- uting all causes of alleged akratic actions to the breakdown of this link. No easy battle has been won, to be sure. And it does not seem likely that any significant battle in this direction can be won unless some basic explications can be offered about the possible mechan- isms underlying the relationship between valuation and motivation. Such a relationship may not be unidirectional, say, a motivation always follows a prior valuation; or vise versa, evaluative ranking can only be assigned to existing desires, whatever their origins. There are possible complexities not only in terms of mutual depend- ence or affection between motivation and valuation, but also in terms of other possible relevant factors, such as cognitive biases and heuristics, attentions, proximity, etc., that may figure in activat- ing or mediating a particular mode of interaction between the two. In lack of any systematic theory which is able to address these issues, it seems very hard to explain, for instance, why my desire to insult Wayne had enjoyed motivational clout disproportionate to my evaluation of it. Neither is it likely, without such a theory, to explain why under normal circumstances involving competing desires, rational agents tend to keep their intentional actions in line with their best evaluative judgments. Although a full presentation of such a systematic theory will not be attempted here, a tentative schematic exemplar in this direction might prove helpful. Suppose now that we all grant that the balance of one's moti- vation could be occasionally out of line with one's evaluative judgment. Does this general possibility itself suffice to explain a particular akratic action? One may still wonder why these mental items are out of line with each other in this but not that particular way. One may want to know what might explain, in psychologically realistic terms, how such a disparity arises in concrete, real-world situations. The need for such a further explanatory scheme is crucial for ultimately cashing out the account of akratic action that we seek. It is precisely at this point that George Ainslie's picoeconomic theory seems to fit in quite nicely.</page><page sequence="7">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 233 IV. THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF A PICOECONOMIC MODEL IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE DAVIDSONIAN PARADOX OF IRRATIONALITY Ainslie's picoeconomics is a theory about preference change over time that generates explanations for a wide variety of psycholog- ical phenomena. The basic hypothesis of Ainslie's theory is that the behavior-revealed preferences of any subject for temporally located rewards will undergo dynamic changes, following what psycholo- gists call 'the matching law,' to the effect of discounting the future in a certain distinctive way. This law is based on weighty empirical evidence in series of experimental studies of animal (including some human) dynamic behaviors in more than three decades since 1961, when Richard Herrnstein first identified a simple formula predicting pigeons' relative preferences for alternatives in certain (concurrent variable-interval) schedules (Ainslie, 1992, pp. 63-76). Such an empirical discovery not only fits well with classic observations, in domains like economics, on the general tendency of human agents to devalue or discount future events (Ainslie, 1992, pp. 56-58); but it may also materialize some philosophers' speculation about the possible relevance of temporal factors to akratic behavior.5 The matching law in its simplified as well as fine-tuned versions can be presented in a hyperbolic form of function with X coordinate as time and Y as preference ordering. The distinctiveness of the hyperbolic discount curve lies in the following two features. One is a temporary high preference for imminent reward. The other is that it entails preference-reversals typically involved in akratic actions: two hyperbolic discount curves corresponding to two rewards at different temporal locations will cross if the one for the earlier consumption is a lesser reward.6 The above two features combine to show that the subjective (momentary) value at proximity to a reward rises very sharply, being able to exceed values of other rewards previously preferred but more delayed in the time; on the other hand, when both rewards are perceived at some distance, the larger reward always has a higher value than the smaller one does (see Figure 1). Here is how Mele summarizes Ainslie's position and puts it to use to explain an important species of disparities between motivation and valuation which are presumed to be pertinent to akratic actions (1987,pp.85-86):7</page><page sequence="8">234 YUJIAN ZHENG (1) The curve describing the effectiveness of reward as a func- tion of delay is markedly concave upwards. That is, a desire for a reward of a prospective action, other things being equal, acquires greater motivational force as the time for the reward's achievement approaches, and after a certain point motivation increases sharply. (2) Human beings are not at the mercy of the effects of the prox- imity of rewards. They can bring it about that they act for a larger, later reward in preference to a smaller, earlier one by using 'pre-committing device,' a form of self-control. Rewards that are due at different times will be chosen in proportion to their actual amounts, as long as the choice is made far enough in advance (again see Figure 1). And if someone who chooses early believes that his preference for the better alternative is apt to change, he will be motivated to exercise self-control. In some cases, exercises of self-control are both required and successful (my italics). A general line of explanation of akratic actions can be generated by the above two-tier model as follows: The agent judged it best to do C, but the level of his motivation to do C was such that, due to the (perceived) proximity of the rewards of A, to his earlier level of motivation to seek those rewards, and to his failure to make effective use of self- control techniques that he had at his disposal, he was more motivated to do A (Mele, 1987, p. 85). This 'proximity explanation' looks promising as a good start towards resolving the puzzle of akrasia, though it has not yet expli- citly touched the issue of irrationality. Let us now examine how this explanation is able to meet the challenge from a Davidsonian paradox: The underlying paradox of irrationality, from which no theory can entirely escape, is this: if we explain it too well, we turn it into a concealed form of rationality; while if we assign incoherence too glibly, we merely compromise our ability to diagnose irrationality by withdrawing the background of rationality needed to justify any diagnosis at all (Davidson, 1982, p. 303). The thrust of this paradox lies in challenging us to give a causally sufficient mechanism of the puzzling behavior on the one hand, and</page><page sequence="9">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 235 TIME (Delay = T - t)T, 2 Figure 1. Hyperbolic curves for the values of a reward available at time T I and an alternative that is objectively twice as great but is available one unit of time later, as a function of decreasing delay (D = T - t) before they become available. to retain certain rational ground to justify our, as well as the agent's own, criticism of his behavior on the other. First, let us look at tier 1 in Mele's summary above. The basic point is that, ceteris paribus, it is the desire/reward with the greatest matching-law-determined motivational valence that dominates at each moment of time, regardless of any previous and subsequent motivational valences. When we take the discount effect of the matching law as etiologically primary, i.e., applicable to humans as well as animals (such as pigeons) which may not have high-level cognitive powers and self-consciousness, it is reasonable to suppose that no role of 'best judgment' is needed at tier 1. This certainly does not mean, however, that whenever a human agent forms a best judgment about what to do in a dynamic choice-setting, there must be a prior stage in which only pure, matching-law-determined judgment-free motivations exist. Rather, the supposition here is quite moderate: i.e., in conceptual analysis, it is conceivable that</page><page sequence="10">236 YUJIAN ZHENG human beings are always subject to certain pre-rational motivational mechanisms shared by many animals. Tier 2 in Mele's summary involves three things: A) the almost inevitable human scenario in which rational agents will make best judgments when facing dynamic, conflicting rewards; B) the ques- tion how it comes to be the case that a best judgment, once it is made, acquires whatever motivational valence it has; and C) the possibility that this valence, without the aid of (successful) self-control, may still be less than that of the momentary impulse corresponding to an imminent reward. In order to meet Davidson's challenge of retaining rational (self-)criticism in a targeted causal explanation for irrational actions, which potentially has the rationalizing function in virtue of being an explanation,8 it is not enough just to list the above points at tier 2. We have to show, perhaps by relating these points, why the agent may regard his own action as irrational despite the fact that he was most strongly motivated to do so. The first step towards the targeted account is to see how a best judgment relates to a rational criticism in the subjective sense. It seems plausible to say that one's action can be genuinely susceptible to subjective rational criticism only if one has made a best judgment based on one's assessment of reasons for alternative choices. An action cannot be subjectively rational if it violates the best reason one has or endorses at the time of the action. In this sense, retaining as well as making a best judgment is necessary for subjective ration- ality; or, equivalently, violating one's best judgment (without change of reasons) is sufficient for subjective irrationality. The next step is to show how it could be the case that, given the picoeconomic picture of future-discounting, someone whose primary motivation is undergoing determined dynamic (and even dramatic) changes does not change whatever best judgment he has made earlier. This will clearly draw on the relationship between dynamic motivations and evaluative judgments. Any judgment, as an exercise of cognitive powers, is always already somewhat removed from pure conation or motivation on the one hand, and can be in one way or another associated with whatever motivation possibly relates to the object of the judgment on the other. In a typical Ainsliean case, for instance, the agent's best</page><page sequence="11">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 237 judgment, based on a cognitive comparison of the actual amounts of alternative rewards spread over time, corresponds extensionally to a pre-evaluative choice (or set of choices) made far enough in advance of those rewards.9 And, typically, the motivational valence associated with such a best judgment corresponds to the motiva- tion level of the largest reward among the set of conflicting rewards perceived from a far enough distance. Nevertheless, as the time for the achievement of an earlier but actually lesser reward in the set approaches, the greater motivation originally associated with the best judgment can be suddenly reversed, because of the proximity effect of the matching law, by the close-up reward without thereby losing the best judgment itself. That is to say, the motivational advantage on the side of the best judgment can be usurped while its evaluative standing persists in cognition - since proximity does not legitimately count as relevant in cognitive evaluation. Why is proximity not relevant to cognitive evaluation? Well, logically speaking, evaluation only appeals to reasons, which are located in a different logical space than that of causes, and proximity effects only make sense in the latter space.10 Of course, however, this does not amount to saying that motivations, as causal items that are susceptible to proximity effects, cannot turn into reasons one way or another, and vice versa; rather, what I claim at this point is that primary motivations, as presumably determined by the matching law, must be somehow mediated or reflected by reasons in order to have anything to do with evaluative judgments and prox- imity cannot automatically or invariably prompt such mediation or reflection. 1 1 If this claim is acceptable, one should have no difficulty seeing why the akratic agent himself may regard his incontinence as irrational, given his unchanged assessment of the reasons for which he may act. (Later in the paper, I shall provide a distinctive, stronger argument for the persistence of the evaluative standing of a best judgment.) In this manner we may meet Davidson's challenge, viz., to present an explanation of strict akratic action without rendering it subjectively rational. The 'proximity explanation' thus elaborated seems to be a plau- sible account of an occasional disparity between evaluation of and motivation from a certain reward; and such a disparity seems to be the culprit for being subjectively irrational. This explanation,</page><page sequence="12">238 YUJIAN ZHENG however, does not tell why the agent did not use effective self- control to compensate for the presumably irrational discount effect he could have known in advance. Two straightforward answers might be available. The first one points to the possible fact that a mere criticism of irrationality of one's prospective behavior may not be motivationally alerting or irritating enough to stimulate his immediate commitment to self-control. He may not, for instance, always take seriously certain isolated (at least to his mind) bad consequences of indulging his immediate temptation. The other answer lies partially in the particular feature of the hyperbolic form of the matching law, i.e., the sharp arising spike of motivation in the imminence of a reward (see Figure 1). As long as we do not take the causal power of each possible self-control technique as unlim- ited (such as when Ulysses physically bound himself to the mast), it should not surprise us if someone who is already motivated to adopt a certain self-control technique may still fail to countervail the uprising momentary impulse towards the imminent reward, simply because his choice of the technique is not adequate enough. There remains a doubt, however, about whether the 'akratic action' generated in the way of 'proximity explanation' above is real akrasia. For when the Ainsliean agent undergoes the supposed preference reversal in the proximity of a lesser reward, i.e., when he is more motivated to take the close-up reward than the later but greater one, and if these two rewards are all that concerns him at the moment, his present evaluative judgment should, as it were, reflect this motivational change and reverse the earlier 'best judg- ment' accordingly. Then his action driven by his stronger temporary preference will not qualify as akrasia since it is no longer 'contrary to the agent's best judgment.' Failing to adjust or update one's best judgment at the level of deliberate reasoning can be explicable, say, by appeal to a failure of self-knowledge. Such a failure, neverthe- less, does not imply that one's behavior has no underlying reason that can be provided by a certain judgment one deems 'best' in some sense. In an easily understandable sense of satisfying one's strongest motivation, one can always say the following about an Ainsliean agent: he actually chooses what he most values despite the apparent persistence of the evaluative standing of his earlier preference.'2</page><page sequence="13">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 239 My quick response to the objection is this. What counts as 'akratic' must be something against the 'best judgment' one actually holds at the moment for one reason or another. It simply will not do to claim that one has another, even better judgment but somehow repressed or forgotten. If a certain 'judgment' were supposed to operate at an unconscious level, it would not belong to the proper concept of 'best judgment' we are talking about when we deal with akrasia. 13 If it meant instead a possible judgment which should have been made by the agent, this would amount to imposing an extrinsic criterion upon the agent's own spontaneous process of judgment formation and thus artificially excluding akrasia from the applicable domain of the picoeconomic model. After all, in this model, the akratic agent does not, as an Aristotelian's analysis would suppose, forget anything or have any malfunction of cognitive powers when he makes and retains his best judgment. He knows what he chooses and why, but only does not find it reasonable or justifiable - he readily admits his own irrationality in so acting. But, on a closer look, the motive of the above objection might be viewed as lying in a deeper worry about the possible arbitrariness of the 'best judgment' of the Ainsliean agent. For the matching law itself does not seem to exclude the psychological possibility of forming a best judgment merely based on the satisfaction of one's strongest motivation at a particular moment, a best judgment unbound by any previous judgments as well as motivations.14 As long as such a possibility exists, one can hardly exclude a possible competitive situation in which potential candidates for best judg- ments fight for the legitimate or 'official' status, so to speak. If this is true, then the picoeconomic model I try to defend seems to owe the sceptic an explanation for the necessity or dynamic stability of a particular kind of best judgments in those typical Ainslien scenarios which involve rational deliberation in the face of imminent temptation. More specifically, a desirable model has to address the following issues: Why can certain temporary motiva- tions, rather than others of equal efficacy, get fully reflected or represented in ex ante evaluative judgments of the correspondent rewards; and, conversely, why can certain forms of judgments, rather than others, turn into efficacious motivation (e.g., to launch successful self-control)? This is the task to which I now turn.</page><page sequence="14">240 YUJIAN ZHENG V. BEST JUDGMENT AND A CONSTRUCTIVIST NOTION OF ITS RATIONALITY One may question the rational status of a 'best judgment' that corre- sponds to a preference formed far enough in advance of alternative rewards. Why should we give rational priority to such a preference which, like all other matching-law-determined temporary prefer- ences, will change over time? For instance, I prefer this afternoon not to watch my favourite world cup of soccer on TV tonight because I have to prepare tomorrow's lecture and I form a best judgment based on such a preference. But when I hear the sound of the soccer tournament from my neighbour's TV at night, I come to prefer turning on my TV to working on the preparation, though I still remember my own preference in the afternoon and know that there has been no change of information since then. The fact is that I now want to watch TV most. Why should I not change my best judgment because of this fact? And why should I give rational priority to a preference I do not currently have? It can hardly help to assert that the actual reward, or the 'objective value' of giving a good lecture is larger than that of watching a good soccer tournament, though this might be true in some specifiable sense of 'objective value.' For the question here is not whether we can find an objective ground on which those seemingly incommensurable rewards can be compared; it is rather why I should take a somewhat larger 'objective value' seriously - seriously enough as to try to change my current preference by all means. In what follows, I shall argue that it is not accidental that a dynamically stable best judgment corresponds to the preferences formed far in advance of alternative rewards in typical pico- economic scenarios; and the same underlying process provides the reason why one has to discriminate among one's first-order temporary preferences and control them accordingly. In this way, I shall be able to offer a constructivist account of the ration- ality of 'best judgment,' i.e., a construction of its rationality from a base as minimal as possible. Specifically, the minimal base will consist of a thin picoeconomic conception of person, with minimal assumptions about cognitive and rational capacities of mind, plus certain initial conditions about the dynamic distribution of rewards in relevant scenarios. As a result of this constructivist</page><page sequence="15">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 241 approach, the two issues raised at the end of the last section will be resolved. Picoeconomics is a free-market conception of person as a collec- tion of interests that shift over time according to a certain mathemat- ically explicable law (i.e., the matching law) and are thus potentially competitive for their respective realization in time. As a framework for a potential model of mind, the distinction of picoeconomics lies in the motivational nature of its foundation stones, viz., dynamic interests of various-ranges, which are all 'created equal' in the sense that no one has privileged access to the limited resources of time and energy of the system/person before entering the 'market' of free competition. What seems most interesting to me about such a model is that some rational structure, with distinctive hierarchies and rules, can endogenously emerge from the dynamic process of interactions among these basic interests under the external constraints of reality. In other words, rational reconstruction of various high-order mental formations from the 'mundane' practical interests is made possible by such a model. Although what I shall do next is only a small sample of the conceivable project, the general, perhaps unconven- tional character of the approach merits special attention. Without such attention, some of the following discussions may sound trivial, especially for those who tend to take for granted the mandate of our epistemic judgments. Let us consider a hypothetical dynamic choice setting. Two rewards A and B will be available to me at two different moments in the future: A will be consumable sooner than B. They are mutu- ally exclusive, i.e., I can only consume one of them. There is no commensurable standard by which I can measure or compare their rewarding effects on me. They are simply different kinds of reward, i.e., they have nothing in common except that either one will give me some kind of rewarding experience if I consume it. Now, to make the scenario a bit tougher, let us further suppose that although I am a minimally rational person with normal cognitive capacities such as memory, attention, association, etc., I am extremely inexperienced, particularly with regard to rewards like A and B. (Here 'minimally rational' means that I have the idea of 'end-means' relations and can choose a cost-effective means to whatever goal I happen to have.) After a few rounds of trial (including the preliminary 'tasting' of A</page><page sequence="16">242 YUJIAN ZHENG and B separately), I find that I like B more than A most of the time in each round except for a short period when the consumption of A is imminent. Everything postulated so far is compatible with the basic pico- economic assumption of the matching law. Now two -possible situ- ations can follow: One is that I just float with the up-and-down current, so to speak, of my motivation and choose what I most prefer at each point; and in that case, I will choose reward A because it has the higher matching-law-determined motivational valence in the neighbourhood of its onset time. The other situation is, however, that I can no longer endure that my preference for B frequently is frus- trated by my choice of A. Such frustration can turn into regret after I pass the 'high' time of consuming A. In order to avoid such frus- tration or regret, i.e., being negatively motivated, during the period way before the imminence of A, by the perceived future loss or pain, I have to take measures to change the situation. But - a pause perhaps is needed for some reflection here - how would I know, way before the imminence of A, the fact that my preference for B is going to be frustrated, if it were the first time I face such a dynamic choice between A and B and I had never had similar experiences of preference reversal and aftermath regret before? The precognition that A and B are mutually exclusive would certainly not be enough to let me foresee the fact; I might never believe that A will overtake B, which is what I clearly prefer now. The real effect of the matching law must await one's own experience to verify and cognize. Only when enough experiences of bitter regret as a result of the 'free-floating' behavior inform my memory and implant a keen sense of aversion in my mental association of its reoccurrence, do I begin to foresee the fact and see it as a present problem or a threat to my present interest (even though, and precisely because, at present I am perfectly comfortable with my preference of B). For the satis- faction of my present interest depends on the future event that B will be consumed. It is such a presently felt problem or 'pain' that drives me to try to get rid of its source, i.e., to take measures to avoid the future frustration and thus to help restore the peace of mind to the present moment.</page><page sequence="17">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 243 At this point, if I am reminded that the conditions of the game are such that I cannot change either the availability of, or the dynamic relationship between, the rewards by acting on the external world. The only thing I can do is try to change or manipulate the motiva- tional balance by drawing on my intra-psychic resources. A relevant evaluative judgment seems a precondition for any mental act in this direction. Forming a judgment may not always be a delib- erate act and often times it may spring spontaneously and without any practical consequences. But at the present moment of anxiety for changing, my evaluative judgment, whatever its origin, must exhibit something beyond merely reporting my momentary prefer- ence, such as "reward B is what I most want now." That is, the normative implication of the judgment must be spelled out: the intent of the judgment is to place certain constraints on some of my future motivational states which seem undesirable from my present perspective. If there is any actual or potential link between present forms of evaluation and future motivation, the making of my present evalu- ative judgment must be put in such a form and in such full swing as to exploit the link to its maximum effect. Also, if I am already alert to the internal connection between my future consumption of B and my present preference satisfaction, my present best judg- ment can hardly fail to consider those obvious future factors that will contribute to the loss of B. In light of these observations, a viable normative judgment should adopt a form that is most likely to survive the prospective preference reversal. Given the constant shift of temporal reference of 'now', even a best judgment like "I should not choose A when A is available, because I clearly want to choose B now (and I know why I will have a momentary zeal for A at ti)"' is futile unless it takes a temporally universal form: "Choosing B is for my long-range interests." Since the judgment of such a universal form does not represent any particular temporary interest in the range, it will then equally apply to those motivational states in the imminence of A. As long as I remember the judgment, its validity cannot be easily dismissed, since it is based on a detached and global perspective ('global' with reference to the temporal extension of the competitive, repeatable rewards under consideration).</page><page sequence="18">244 YUJIAN ZHENG Of course, however, this does not mean that a best judgment of mine formulated in such a form will be motivationally effective enough to overrule the momentary temptation of the imminent reward I face. The motivational force, if there is any, on the side of my best judgment derives from the aggregate effect of those of my temporary preferences for B in the longer range under consideration. The more the aggregative temporary preferences for B, the greater the motivational force on the side of my best judgment. Therefore the result of the motivational battle between the best judgment and the imminent temptation depends largely on how long the range of the game under consideration is, if, as assumed, I prefer B to A in the majority (i.e., a fixed large proportion) of time within that range. No matter what the actual motivational battle turns out to be, nevertheless, the main point established here is that a certain type of best judgment underlying some presently felt need to avoid future loss can be formulated in a universal form, i.e., that the loss of my long-range satisfaction of preferences is worse for myself (my 'present self' as well as my 'future selves') than the loss of any short-range satisfaction of temporary preferences. The best judg- ment thus formulated represents a leap from a local state of temporal interests, viz., one's present preference profile, to a global state of the same set of interests, viz., one's long-term overall satisfaction. Since the cross-temporal, global character of the best judgment implies equal applicability of the judgment to each moment in the considered range, it thus warrants a kind of dynamic stability of the judgment; i.e., the best judgment is unlikely to change waywardly, even in the face of the seemingly irresistible upsurge of imminent temptation. Now we seem to have a stronger argument for the case that the evaluative standing of a judgment may persist in cognition while a preference reversal occurs in an akratic action, than the previous argument in section IV, i.e., that proximity is irrelevant in cognitive evaluation. The deliberative process delineated so far is a rational reconstruc- tion of possible real-world scenarios involving dynamic preference change. That does not mean, of course, that every rational agent, even with similar degree of akratic tendency, would undergo the same deliberative process when he found himself in such a scenario. Individual differences in cognitive and other aspects of mentality, in</page><page sequence="19">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 245 past experiences or habits, etc. can bring variation and complexity to the real-time manifestations of the deliberative process recon- structed above. What needs stress here is that rational deliberation of a particular kind, exemplified by the above process, is in principle open to anyone who does not want to be always under the spell of a certain psychological mechanism, whose effects are nonetheless believed to be curbable. A best judgment is only one, but important product of such rational deliberation. Generally speaking, a (certain type of) best judgment can be conceptualised as being globally prompted, continuously tested and occasionally modified by the flow of one's motivational experiences. The flow normally has ups and downs, correlating with positive or negative rewards, the structure of their temporal distribution, and kinds and degrees of interconnectedness between similar or opposite rewards. Best judgment thereby reflects those of one's temporary preferences that 'spring up' with such a degree of frequency that is of considerable statistic significance when compared with others in the same considered range. Thus it can be seen that the stability of best judgment is endogenous to the dynamic motivational process in certain particular choice settings. Such an endogenous stability surely explains the non-arbitrariness of (at least a certain type of) best judgment. On the other hand, we have also seen that the dynamic stability of best judgment, whose root function is to discriminate among one's (all matching-law-determined) temporary preferences, is closely linked to its necessity for resolving the dynamic problem of prefer- ence reversals. Without extra-psychic devices for changing certain relevant causal relations in the external world (as in the case of Ulysses binding himself to the mast), best judgment seems to be the only viable starting point for launching whatever intra-psychic devices to deal with the problem.15 In this sense, best judgment, in one form or another, is necessary, though alone maybe not sufficient, for activating, grouping or conjuring up enough primary motivations from near as well as afar along the temporal dimension to join the battle against the imminent enemy. Although a best judgment of an agent need not be 'objectively' rational in order for an action of his to be akratic or subjectively irrational, many best judgments are rational in the sense that they</page><page sequence="20">246 YUJIAN ZHENG are practically necessary for getting out of the dynamic traps, in which the agent may often find himself, and the formation of these judgments cannot be arbitrary when they are prompted by realistic hope of circumventing the traps. In this sense, the rationality of making and following certain best judgments in certain types of dynamic choice settings can be constructed through the endogenous motivational processes shaped by the choice settings as well as the psychological (matching) law. Against the general picture thus drawn, it is not hard to explain now why only certain first-order motivations, rather than others, can get fully represented in one's well-thought ex ante best judg- ment - that is simply because the mode of their distribution and interconnection in the considered domain of time makes them statis- tically significant to the overall satisfaction of one's interests in that domain. Conversely, in a case of successful self-control, the best judgment formulated according to the emerged global perspective, rather than other, more transient judgments based on local states of mind, has a better chance to dominate and turn itself, directly or indirectly, into an effective motivation against whatever momentary temptations. VI. SOME FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THE PICOECONOMIC APPROACH There is another vantage point, a point of normativity, from which we can look at the construction of the rationality of best judgment. As we have seen above, the purpose of making judgments in the flow of one's successive motivational states can be nothing but to (express an intention to) place certain constraints on some of one's temporary preferences which seem undesirable from the perspec- tives of other temporary preferences. Such constraints, if successful, are self-imposed, i.e., they are not imported from without but origi- nated from within one's own (pico-)economy of dynamic interests. There are obvious normative elements here: at one level, it is the discriminative intention of making judgments that call for certain constraints; at another, it is the emergence of a global perspective on one's overall satisfaction of interests that actually brings about the constraints, i.e., by transcending the temporally-situated base of</page><page sequence="21">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 247 preferences and grouping together the motivations from all relevant temporary preferences which are originally isolated from each other. As soon as such a normative global perspective is constructed, those familiar objectivistic expressions such as 'utility,' 'maximiza- tion of utility' etc. can immediately make sense, i.e., acquire their normative significance for our practical concerns from a firm, non- arbitrary ground of natural human motivations in dynamic choice. For instance, the practical importance for dynamic choice of 'utility,' as a mathematical construct of preference orderings, lies in its capacity to make normative judgments simpler or easier by objectifying shifting dynamic preferences for the rewards tempor- ally located: It is a particular number assigned to each of the rewards, which otherwise may not be commensurable, according to the relative rank of each corresponding preference against the systematic comparisons of all relevant preferences in a similar (say, far enough) temporal distance to all these rewards. Such objectification is impossible without the prior emergence of global perspective, whose primary function is to let the relations among those temporally separated and distributed rewards become clear in a new logical space, i.e., the space of reasons. Constraining as well as representing relationships among dynamic preferences, expressible in forms of judgments, are only understandable or justi- fiable against such a global perspective. It can be further seen that the notion of 'rationality' in the sense of 'maximization of utility' cannot be concerning only a particular local state of mind, but is rather concerning the matter of motivation and cognition (or their interweaving) from an intrapersonal global perspective and, no less importantly, concerning the normative implications for the local mental states of taking this global perspective seriously. In a nutshell, rationality is about whole-part constraining relationship in a fundamentally normative way.16 Picoeconomics, as a fundamentally motivational model of mind, involves conceptual resources not only for an adequate explanation of akrasia, but also for an explanation of why an agent may come to want, and sometimes successfully exercise, self-control in favor of his best judgment which happens to be against his strongest first- order motivation at the time. It should be noted, on the one hand, that it is a special merit of the picoeconomic model that both the expla-</page><page sequence="22">248 YUJIAN ZHENG nation for akratic action and that for endogenous self-control can ultimately appeal to the same underlying psychological mechanism, viz., the future-discounting propensity described by the matching law. On the other hand, however, it should be stressed that the explanation for self-control is conceptually distinctive from, and directionally opposite to the long-targeted explanation of akrasia, and the need for the former is largely neglected by standard theories of rationality. The neglect is not accidental, but reveals a deep-seated intellectualistic tendency (since Socrates) to take for granted the mandate of our best epistemic judgment - i.e., conformity to the mandate is taken as the normal and natural while deviation from it the abnormal or exceptional. Therefore, there is no need for any explanation for such a supposedly 'natural form' of consistent or continent behavior, and the explanatory onus falls only upon akratic action, the supposedly 'anomalous form' of behavior. In contrast with this intellectualistic tendency, the picoeconomic model can be said to start with the ubiquity as well as the primacy of 'the anom- alous' and end up with the normative construction of 'the natural.' Such a reverse orientation of the picoeconomic model would seem to force us to rethink the broader framework of practical reason in a fundamentally constructivist, yet more naturalised way. NOTES 1 See Plato, Protagoras. Socrates' denial rests upon the idea that it is not 'in human nature' to pursue freely what one takes to be the lesser good. For a fairly comprehensive survey of the contemporary (since early 70s) philosophical liter- ature on akrasia, see Walker (1989). 2 For a detailed analysis of this definition, see Audi (1979, 1990); and F. Jackson argues that acting against one's better judgment is neither necessary nor sufficient for weakness of will, see Jackson (1984). 3 For a fairly detailed discussion of the nature and function of best judgment in relation to akrasia, see Mele (1995, chapter 2). And Mele (1996) also attempts to identify a derivative type of akratic action from a motivationally biased process that underlies the production of the corresponding best judgment. 4 Pettit and Smith try to characterize the mismatch between valuation and moti- vation in terms of the breakdown of resonance between the deliberative and intentional dimensions of action, and generate a systematic taxonomy of the different types of mismatch in a geometrical way, see Pettit and Smith (1993). 5 E.g., Jackson sees the akratic problem lying in a change of the agent's desire over time that is not fully consequent upon changes in his (probability) beliefs,</page><page sequence="23">AKRASIA, PICOECONOMICS, AND JUDGEMENT FORMATION 249 see Jackson (1984, pp. 13-18); and Margolis sees a timing defect in the agent's volitional capacity, i.e., due to not having exercised his volition relevantly in prior circumstances, see Margolis (1981, pp. 24-26). 6 Discount curves that cross over time do not arise from the conventional form of discounting - the exponential function in economics, e.g., for interest rate calcu- lations. The reason is that exponential curves decline by a constant proportion of the remaining balance per unit of time elapsed. 7 Mele's summary is based on Ainslie's earlier articles (1975, 1982) and not his later, comprehensive book (1992). But the basic ideas are already there in those earlier works. 8 There seems to be an underlying thesis in Davidson's expression of the paradox of irrationality, especially considering its context, which might be put as follows: any causal explanation for an action has at least the potential function of rational- ization of the latter; or, in other words, a cause can become a reason by properly entering (say, being reflected) into a logical space of concepts. Both the exegetic and defensive arguments for this thesis merit separate treatment in a different paper. The notable thing here is that this thesis is the converse of Davidson's more well-known thesis that "rationalization is a species of causal explanation." For an explication of the sense in which a reason is a rationalizing cause of an action, see Davidson (1980, pp. 3-5, p. 9, p. 233). 9 The term 'far enough in advance' is crucial for any time-related choice to count as conforming to the better judgment, for only at such a distance to the concerned alternative rewards the matching-law-determined choice is able to reflect correctly the ratio between their actual amounts. 10 For an informative discussion of Wilfrid Sellars's idea that placing something in the logical space of reasons is to be contrasted with giving an causal description of it, see McDowell (1996, pp. 5-13, 70-86). My argument here, however, do not have to draw on a robust conception of the two logical spaces; a weaker distinction between logical properties of reason and of cause, as possibly implied in the successive sentence, would suffice. l1 Mele (1996) tries to argue that motivations can often induce changes of best judgments through various indirect processes which are motivationally biased. But this thesis, if tenable, by no means shows that factors like proximity invari- ably lead to changes of reasons that figure centrally in the corresponding best judgments. 12 The point of this objection seems compatible with Davidson's and Hare's principles of sufficiency presented at the beginning of this article: If one can somehow reinterpret 'judging it best' in the principles as referring to what S actually most values in his first-order temporary preferences, then these principles seem to be able to apply to Ainsliean cases and therefore reject the authenticity of the 'akratic' actions generated in the picoeconomic model. On the other hand, however, my following responses to the objection can, if successful, also serve as a reason to repudiate these sufficiency principles thus interpreted. 13 It is not necessary for me to deny flatly the possibility that there are certain unconscious judgments which may have cognitive functions of some kind. The</page><page sequence="24">250 YUJIAN ZHENG real issue here, however, is that if we substitute the unconscious judgment for the contemporary, conscious best judgment in an allegedly akratic action, the agent can no longer be supposed to be able to acknowledge his own action as irrational, irrational relative to his presently (and consciously) held judgment - thus the original puzzle of 'subjective irrationality' disappears as if through a magic backdoor. 14 Mele (1996), in an attempt to identify a different kind of akratic episodes than strict akratic actions, argues that change of best judgments simply because of motivational influence is akratic. I do not find the argument very convincing, however. Here I shall take a different approach to the issue of rationality of best judgments. 15 Ainslie (1992) introduces into his theory a central conceptual device called 'personal rules' in resolving the problems of dynamic inconsistency in repeated scenarios. And he has discussed in detail how the driving idea (i.e., the idea of grouping together successive similar choice nodes) underlying personal rules may help, for a motivational purpose at hand, aggregate relevant motivations from similar situations no matter how far such situations lie in future (pp. 142-173). 16 Such conclusions could be drawn from similar arguments about a dynamic process of preference shift conditioned by certain ubiquitous psychological mech- anisms which may only share some, but not all of the features of the matching law. In other words, most of the points reached above may not sensitively depend upon the truth of all the empirical details of the particular psychological law assumed in this paper.
