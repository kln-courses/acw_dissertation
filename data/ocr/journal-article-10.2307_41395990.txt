<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph LeConte and the Reconciliation of Science and Religion By John Al. Martin ALTHOUGH scientist, especially Joseph in LeConte the fields is of generally geology and recognized physics, as few a scientist, especially in the fields of geology and physics, few realize that he was one of the early advocates of the reconciliation between evolution and religion. He, nevertheless, was a diligent student of both the Bible and science and wrote and spoke extensively on the subject of reconciliation between the two. In his Autobiography , LeConte himself expressed the view that his works in this area were "among the most important" of his writings. From a scientific family- his father, an older brother, an uncle, and a cousin are recognized in the Dictionary of American Biography- he early acquired an interest in science. Although he was not yet ready to accept its implications, his reading of Robert Chambers' The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation represented a landmark in his intellectual development. Appearing in the mid-1840's, it showed the derivative origin of species along lines laid down by Lamarck. LeConte later read and re-read Owen's Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate System and was captivated by the idea that law and similarities ran through the "infinitely diversified forms of Nature." As a student of Louis Agassiz at the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard, LeConte was led strongly toward becoming an evolutionist. Even though Agassiz re- jected evolution, he, in his laws of succession of organic forms in the geological history of the earth, laid foundations for later work in evolution. At the University of Georgia in the early 185 o's, LeConte discussed the "general laws of animal structure as evidence of a divine plan." He continued to read further in the fields of science and philosophy and, under the influence of the writings of Charles Darwin, became a "reluctant evolutionist" and later a "thorough and enthusi- astic" one.1 LeConte's first effort to "reconcile the truths revealed by the Scrip- ture with those revealed by Nature" grew out of a series of lectures delivered to a young men's Bible class while he was still teaching at the College of South Carolina and later to groups at San Francisco [78]</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPHLECONTE 79 and Oakland after his transfer to the University of California in 1869. Given when he was still a reluctant evolutionist, the lectures were recorded stenographically on the third occasion and published in 1873 with the title Religion and Science a Series of Sunday Lectures on the Relation of Natural and Revealed Religion, or the Truths Revealed in Nature and Scripture. In the first lecture he explained that his pur- pose was to deal with the "doctrine of Christian belief viewed from the stand-point of science." Such an approach was needed, he said, because so many people believed there was an "irreconcilable antagonism between science and revelation." As a student of both the Scripture and Nature, he proposed to show that the revelations of the latter confirmed those of the former.2 Answering those who maintained that the discoveries of geology, astronomy, and biology threatened the idea of the existence of a divine intelligence, LeConte declared that the existence of a personal Deity could be derived "from the evidences of intelligent contrivance and design in Nature; or the adjustment of parts for a definite and in- telligible purpose." "Geology," he said, "demonstrates a beginning for man, a beginning for organic species, genera, families, a beginning for the organic kingdom, a beginning for the cosmos itself." But, although geology could demonstrate such beginnings, it could not explain the process involved. The best conceivable explanation was " evolution from other species"; this, however, did not explain how the change occurred. Pressure of external conditions, variation and survival of the fittest were factors influencing change, but, he con- tended, there was still an unknown factor. Science could not touch "the argument for design"; it only showed "the modes by which design is carried out." It could never touch the true grounds for religion; its whole function was "to give more rational form and more rational ground for our religious beliefs."3 Nature, LeConte said, revealed a "Being who thinks and wills and â€¢works everywhere around us and within us, and yet is not seen by us." This Being was characterized by certain attributes: omnipresence, eternity, unchangeableness, omniscience and omnipotence. It was a " universal , all-pervading force" which represented the "absolute Being of God." There was direct divine agency in all the phenomena of the universe, and the Deity was present throughout all time in what might be called a "universal present." "Essential knowledge" was His alone. The laws of Nature were simply the divine mode of operation. Geology</page><page sequence="3">8o THE GEORGIA REVIEW showed that the same laws which governed the embryo from germ to maturity governed the evolution of the earth and the organic kingdom from primal chaos to the present; the same mind which gov- erned the one governs the other. Work of the Deity, through time, had been exercised only in the "eternal unfolding of the original concep- tion." Findings of geology, said LeConte, bound the universe to the throne of God by the "universal law of evolution." Much, however, could not be understood, for man was finite and God infinite. Man could apprehend but not comprehend some of the mysteries of creation.4 LeConte felt that divine truth was revealed in the Scripture, the life of Christ and Nature. Nature was the revealed word of God, divine thought made into objective reality. Scripture was already accepted as the revealed word; so should Nature be accepted. The whole object of science was to construct the theology of divine revelation as seen in Nature. When new knowledge was discovered, scientists were prepared to change their interpretations to correspond with newly discovered facts. They were willing to learn from Nature and did not attempt to impose their own views upon her. Rather they sought truth through a search for divine origins. So also should people be willing to give up mistaken interpretations of the Scripture if they were proven false. Science did not seek to destroy religion, but to change it "from childish gaping wonder, and perhaps terror, into rational worship." Science, moreover, recognized that some things could not be understood. It tried to explain what was in the bounds of knowing and left the rest to faith. Its final effect would be "to remove all mystery within mystery, the chaos and confusion of mystery, and leave only the one all-embracing mystery- the cause of existence; which, translated into the language of religion, is the one God."5 Religion, said LeConte, was in a state of transition, caused by the introduction of new scientific concepts; but, throughout history, there had been collisions between religious faith and the prevailing system of philosophy. Such conflicts had come whenever intellectual activity was greatest. In science opposition had first developed against the discoveries of astronomy, then geology and later natural history. In every case, Christianity had emerged from the contest changed, but "stronger and purer." Three main problems had produced the existing collision: the apparent teaching of the Bible that the earth had existed for about six thousand years, the apparent teaching that creation took place in six natural days and the teaching that death appeared with</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH LECONTE 8l the creation of Adam. On the other hand, Nature taught that the earth and the cosmos had been in existence for an inconceivable time, that creation took place, not in six natural days, but through a "gradual process of becoming- each condition of the universe having come out of a previous condition by a gradual process of evolution according to law," and that death had existed from "the beginning of organic creation." These differences, declared LeConte, were between the supposed teachings of the Scripture and the clear teachings of Nature. Under the circumstances, any discordances were unimportant because the gen- eral accordance of the two in "general spiritual truths" should outweigh any minor discrepancies in matters which were of little spiritual sig- nificance. Discoveries made in science had been so rapid and so startling, however, that the popular mind was wholly unprepared and therefore apparently unwilling to adjust them to existing religious views. New discoveries had brought certain dogma into question which had long been accepted as divine truth. With less bigotry on the side of religion and less conceit on the side of science, however, reconciliation would be possible. Since science tended to shake people's faith, scientists should attempt to restore faith, to build its foundations upon a "more solid, enduring, and rational basis." In the past, problems had arisen because reconciliation between the Scripture and Nature had been worked out on the basis of existing knowledge. These views were seized upon by the religious faithful as the only true interpretations. When sci- ence advanced, however, these interpretations became untenable, and re- ligion was forced into the humiliating position of retreating step by step. "There ought not to be," declared LeConte, "... a final or perfect interpretation of either book; certainly not of the Scripture." Ex- planations should simply seek to show the absence of antagonism; but, unfortunately, people clothed divine truth in "human clothing" and then confounded the human clothing with spiritual reality. Faith became petrified into a formula; and, when the human clothing had to be cast off, some thought the divine spirit was gone too. Too often, said LeConte, people, instead of comparing the teachings of Scripture with the teachings of Nature, compared Nature with man's interpreta- tion of the Scripture, theology. "If we must compare," he declared, "let us compare Divine things with Divine things . . . , Scriptures with Nature, our interpretations of Scriptures, theology, with our interpreta- tions of Nature, science."6</page><page sequence="5">82 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Non-recognition of the sacredness of Nature was a major impediment in the way of clearing up the contradictions between science and reli- gion. But Nature was one book of God's, and the Bible another. Nature was the oldest and, to some extent, the "more comprehensive and per- fect." Both originals had the same author and were equally authoritative. Any book about either was mere commentary. One was deciphered by scientists, the other by theologians. Nature was written in the " native handwriting of Deity himself." The Scriptures were written by human hands and were subject to human error. Nature revealed the intelligence of God, the Scriptures His moral nature. "In a word," said LeConte, "the one is the Divine text-book of truth, especially physical truth; the other is the Divine text-book of conduct and of moral truth." Both books were entitled to respect and study. Anyone who ignored or despised either dishonored the author of both, for each book was divine and sacred.7 Some, noted LeConte, maintained that science was changing and imperfect but that theology was not because it was already " complete and perfect." To make such an assertion involved the assumption that the human mind had already "exhausted the treasury of Divine truth." Science made no such claim. Both Nature and the Scripture had much more to be revealed. Nature had an infinite treasury of knowledge "for the diligent and reverent student of Nature," and the Scripture represented an inexhaustible treasury of knowledge "for the devout and prayerful student." If people would admit the sacredness of both books and the finiteness of the interpretations of each, all antagonism would disappear. Some, nevertheless, considered the Scripture a scien- tific treatise and credited it with scientific accuracy in language state- ment. On the other hand, some tried to discredit it because it seemed to be contrary to recent findings. The language of the Scripture, said LeConte, was "never intended to be a scientific statement." It was in the language of the senses, poetry and oratory in many cases, and was intended to teach moral truth, not physical truth. Grand metaphors were used to convey great moral truths. If one wished to discover physical truth, he could find it better in Nature. To try to make of the Bible a scientific treatise was to discredit it.8 Turning to the conflict over Genesis and the meaning of the word "day," LeConte wrote: "By far the grandest interpretation of the chapter is that which makes the creative days great periods of time." Such an interpretation resulted in a "really wonderful accordance be-</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH LECONTE 83 tween the record of the Scripture and the record of Nature," for the order of creation revealed in Genesis was the "order of the evolution of the material universe and of the organic kingdom revealed in Nature." Since God existed throughout time, it was absurd to think that divine days were the same as earthly days. Actually, Genesis was not intended to teach geology or the history of the earth. More important, it did reveal that God came first and created matter and life. Both Nature and Scripture taught that man was the last act of creation and made him God's "highest and noblest work." Both agreed that there was an "elaborate preparation of the earth as the abode of man." Genesis told how God made careful plans for man and then made him as an "immortal spirit like God." Nature taught how the physical and organic changes actually took place. "Every organism," said LeConte, "is but one link in a connected chain- one step in the march of evolution of the organic kingdom; an evolution which finds its term and crown in the human body as the habitation of an immortal spirit." As the highest form of creation, man was capable of making progress by accumulating knowledge and changing his institutions. Since the advent of Chris- tianity, progress had been carried forward by the "gradual develop- ment of this Divine species of institution."0 Following a number of articles and a textbook of geology, LeConte's second book related to science and religion appeared in 1888. Entitled Evolution and Its Relation to Religious Thought , it was written at the suggestion of Henry Ward Beecher who had declared himself an evolutionist and had given a series of lectures in California in 1885. One of LeConte's neighbors, who was acquainted with Beecher, secured some of LeConte's papers about evolution and showed them to Beecher. After reading the material, Beecher wrote LeConte urging him to write a book on the subject. At first hesitant to write because he feared that the church was not ready to profit from such a work, LeConte was convinced by Beecher's letter that he should attempt it, and he began work in the fall of 1885. The book was completed in 1887 and published in early 1888. In it, LeConte attempted to do three things: to give a concise explanation of the meaning of evolution, to present evidences of its truth from different sources, and to show its relation to fundamental religious beliefs. So far, he said, no work had appeared which covered the entire ground. He proposed to make the first two parts as untechnical as possible but, at the same time, to make them scientifically accurate. To him, however, the third part</page><page sequence="7">84 THE GEORGIA REVIEW was the most important, for there was a widespread belief in the popular mind that evolution led to pure materialism and was a threat to teachings concerning religious thought and moral conduct. To see pure materialism in evolution, said LeConte, was a misconception. Since evolution was becoming more and more widely accepted and since there were misconceptions about it, a clear statement of its relation to religious thought was badly needed.10 Evolution, wrote LeConte, was " ( 1 ) continuous progressive change, (2) according to certain laws, (3) and by means of resident forces." The process pervaded the whole universe and concerned every depart- ment of human thought. The law of evolution was "naught else than the scientific or, indeed, the rational mode of thinking about the origin of things in every department of nature." Although people had once thought that continents, mountains, bays, soils, and life were a result of instant creation, geology and the other sciences proved otherwise. Geology showed evolution in terms of the earth; biology showed its existence in the organic kingdom; embryology showed it in the de- velopment of the human body. In the organic kingdom, there had been evolution from the simple to the complex so that the "highest struc- tures" were the ones of most recent appearance; but, said LeConte, these changes had come by natural forces and had been according to a master plan. The law of evolution was "as certain as the law of gravitation."11 To satisfy those who asked for proof of evolution, LeConte explained in simple language a number of factors pointing to the truth of evolu- tion. He pointed to the similarities in the structures of different types of organisms and to the existence of vestigial remains especially in the embryo; he showed that organisms in the embryonic stage went through the various evolutionary stages from the simple to the complex, from generalized tissues to highly specialized tissues; he said that geographic differences in flora and fauna could best be explained by evolution, and, finally, showed that artificial breeding could bring about man- made changes comparable to those made by Nature over the years. To those who maintained that evolution could not be observed, LeConte answered that the few thousand years during which man had been observing were but a day in geological history and that the complex forms which were generally observed were the most rigid and least susceptible to change. The exact processes of evolution were imperfect- ly understood, but the fact of evolution was certain. If conceived</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH LECONTE 85 clearly, it could be accepted, without hesitation, as the "universal law of necessary causation."12 After explaining the proofs of evolution, LeConte turned to its effects on religious beliefs and moral conduct. Although some scientists would object to such an approach and say that the object of science was solely to seek truth, the effect on life was an important element of any doctrine. This subject, he said, was the "chief object" of his work. There could be no doubt that evolution would fundamentally affect traditional views of Nature, of God, and of man. The religious world was on the eve of a great revolution, but first fears were greatly exaggerated. Similar cries had been raised before- objections to the heliocentric theory of the solar system, objections to the law of gravitation, objections to scientific findings of the antiquity of the earth and to the antiquity of man on earth. Now the conflict was over evolution. To some it involved a "universal materialism" which threat- ened to sweep away the foundations not only of Christianity but of all religion and morals. Evolution, however, did not deny creation. Instead, it envisioned creation "by law throughout infinite time" and would be accepted "for the noble conceptions it gives of Nature and of God." In past struggles between religion and science, the result had been a readjustment of beliefs, "a giving up of some notions which really had nothing to do with religion in the proper sense, but which had become so associated with religious belief as to be confounded with the latter . . . , which ought never to have been held because not within the rightful domain of theology at all."13 LeConte questioned the view of some that the conflict over evolution involved a "life-and-death struggle between religion and materialism" and that it denied "the existence of God and the fact of immortality." He admitted that materialism was "becoming a fashion of thought" but denied that there was any connection between materialism and evolu- tion. Evolution was one thing and materialism another. People had simply jumped from the view that all things were created to the view that they were not made at all. Actually, there were three possible views about the origin of the individual: ( 1 ) it was made; (2) it simply grew; (3) it was "made by the process of evolution." The first asserted the divine agency and denied natural process; the second asserted the natural process and denied divine agency; the third asserted " divine agency by natural process" Since either of the first two was incom- plete, the last was a far better explanation of the origin of things. If</page><page sequence="9">86 THE GEORGIA REVIEW God was "an honest worker," according to reason and natural law, ought not the teaching of science to "change gaping wonder into in- telligent delight- superstition into rational worship?" No one should believe that those who taught materialism "walked all the way in the domain of science"; they had stepped over into the domain of phi- losophy. "If," said LeConte, "the pure scientists smile when theological philosophers, unacquainted with the methods of science, undertake to dogmatize on the subject of evolution, they must pardon the phi- losophers if they also smile when the pure scientists imagine they can at once solve questions which have agitated the human mind from the earliest times."14 A major block in the path of reconciliation was the existence of two dogmatisms, science and theology, each equally opposed to the true rational spirit. One clung too much to the old; the other reached out too much for the new. "The new dogmatism," he said, "taunts the old for credulity and superstition; the old reproaches the new for levity and skepticism." Evolution was no more materialistic than other laws of Nature even though it might lead to the abandonment of meaningless theological concepts. Abandonment of these concepts would ennoble Christian conceptions of the Deity and elevate the whole plane of religious thought.15 In light of scientific knowledge, God was even more closely related to Nature than was formerly thought and operated in a more direct way, or Nature operated with no need for God at all. To some, God was merely a master mechanic who created all things and the natural laws and then rested. But Darwin showed continuous change. Either this change came by way of natural laws or by divine agency. The solution was a "frank retimi to the old idea of the direct divine agency, but in a new, more rational, less anthropomorphic form." "It," he said, "is the belief in a God not far away beyond our reach, who once long ago enacted laws and created forces which continue of themselves to run the machine we call Nature, but a God immanent, a God resident in Nature, at all times and in all places directing every event and de- termining every phenomenon- a God in whom in the most liberal sense not only we but all things have their being, in whom all things consist, through whom all things exist, and without whom these could be nothing." Phenomena of Nature were merely objectified modes of di- vine thought, and laws of Nature were His modes of operation. Just as there was infinite space and infinite time, there was an infinite mind.</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH LECONTE 87 The idea of an infinite self was inconceivable, but only in the sense of transcending man's power of comprehension. The idea of a finite consciousness behind the cosmos was even more inconceivable; it was "unthinkable, self-contradictory, absurd." LeConte preferred an in- terpretation which called for an infinite divine will "which by one eternal act ever doing, never done, determines the evolution and the sustentation of an infinite cosmos." To hold such a view, he said, was not to advocate pantheism, for it did not make God into an "all-pervad- ing unconscious force," but, instead, left him as a personal God.16 Evolution did not destroy the concept of design in Nature but only the "low anthropomorphic notions of the mode of working of the Designer." Instead of creation over a brief period, one could envision a creation "embraced and swallowed up in one eternal act of creation- a never-ceasing procession of divine energy." Every object was a crea- tion, not a separate creation but a "separate manifestation of the one continuous creative act." With evolution, petty conceptions about creation could be abandoned; and people could see the conception of "one infinite, all-embracing design, stretching across infinite space, and continuing unchanged through infinite time, which includes and pre- determines and absorbs every possible separate design." All must ac- knowledge that there had to be an infinite immanent Deity behind such phenomena. The function of science was to dispel mysteries and superstitions. In doing so it reduced them to "fewer and grander mysteries, and these again to still fewer and grander, until, in an ideally perfect science, all separate and partial mysteries are swallowed up in the one all-embracing mystery- the mystery of existence."17 Man, said LeConte, could be looked on from two viewpoints, as a part of the animal kingdom or as an immortal spirit belonging to a world of his own. These views, however, could be reconciled. Man had physical attributes similar to those of animals, but he had something more, the ability to turn his thoughts inward and wonder about the mystery of his existence. Man possessed a spirit through which God could communicate with him. Of all animals, man alone had two natures, a lower and a higher. "The whole mission and life-work of man," wrote LeConte, "is the progressive and finally the complete dominance, both in the individual and the race, of the higher over the lower." As material evolution of Nature reached its ultimate goal in man so must man enter upon a "higher spiritual evolution" which would find its goal and completion in the ideal man. The spirit of man "must</page><page sequence="11">88 THE GEORGIA REVIEW ever strive by freer law to attain, through a newer birth, unto a higher life."18 The success of Evolution and Its Relation to Religious Thought ex- ceeded LeConte's expectations. Apparently, the public was eager for such a book, especially for the chapters which attempted to reconcile science and religion. Many clergymen from various denominations wrote LeConte thanking him for the "boldness yet temperateness" of the work. Others, including some scientists, wrote that it saved them from "blank materialism." Men of distinction in England, France, and Italy expressed appreciation for the work.19 The book was republished a few years later with additional chapters, two of which dealt with the relation between evolution and theology. In a chapter entitled "Some Logical Consequences of the Doctrine of Divine Immanency," LeConte pointed out that religious thought had passed through certain evolutionary stages. At first, man believed that God was much like himself, but stronger and larger. His will was "wholly man-like, capricious and without law." In the second stage, men looked on God as man-like, but He was also king-like. He sat enthroned in solitary majesty and acted through physical and natural laws. This conception grew out of scientific beliefs in the "pre- established stability of cosmic order and fixedness of organic types." God was the great architect and artificer but was no longer directly involved in what was taking place. This belief, said LeConte, still lingered in the public mind. In the third stage of religious thought, God could be seen as resident in Nature; the forces of Nature were simply forms of His energy. In this view, there was divine activity of far nobler form which could be demonstrated and verified by the theory of evolution. No other view of the Deity, he declared, was any longer tenable. This conception of God strengthened the concept of design in Nature. No longer was God a "man-like, cabinet-making, watch- making designer," for He was a far greater artificer. Design embraced all space and ran through all time, "including and absorbing all possible and separate designs and predetermining them by a universal law of evolution." The old anthropomorphic view that creation occurred at once was replaced by one of "continuous creation- unhasting, unresting, by the eternal process of evolution."20 In the second edition, LeConte also explained the relation of evolu- tion to teachings about Christ. As organic evolution reached its highest</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPHLECONTE 89 form in man, he declared, human evolution reached its highest form in the ideal man, Christ, who was the " perfect image" of God and in whom the divine character was "completely realized." Just as new powers from the animal point of view appeared with the appearance of man so did new powers from man's point of view appear with the coming of Christ. "We ought," he said, "to expect new powers and properties unimaginable from the human point of view, and therefore to us seemingly supernatural, i.e., above our nature ." Unlike organic evolution, which was controlled by natural forces, human evolution could take place by being drawn "upward and forward from above and in front by the attractive force of ideals." The "most potent agent" in the advance of human character was Christ, the ideal man.21 In a number of articles, LeConte further elaborated his views about the relations between science and religion. Among these was a paper published in the Andover Review in 1891 entitled "The Relation of the Church to Modern Scientific Thought." The fundamental reason for the conflict between science and religion, he said in the article, was "the radically wrong conception of the limits of human knowl- edge." "We mistake," he said, "human knowledge for absolute truth, - truth in its final and perfect form." Truth did exist, but man's in- terpretation of it must ever change to higher and higher forms. So long as church leaders insisted that they possessed absolute truth the conflict would continue. The effect of scientific findings would undoubtedly be revolutionary but, he felt, "in the highest degree beneficent." At first Christian beliefs were "narrow, local, provincial." Now they were being broadened. The mission of science in relation to the church was "to elevate the plane of religious thought and test the validity of religious beliefs; to purify the temple of truth by driving out the false and low, and to strengthen its foundations by verifying the true and the noble." New teachings of science had embodied the conception of God by showing true spiritual theism, had broadened the concept of design in Nature and had made creation a much more glorious work.22 One of LeConte's last papers, entitled "A Note on the Religious Significance of Science," appeared in the January, 1900, issue of the Monist. In it he noted that the most striking characteristic of modern times was the rapid advance of science and that the most rapid modifica- tion in the educational system was the introduction of scientific subject matter, scientific ideas and scientific method. These developments had led the general public "to a kind of glorification of science at the</page><page sequence="13">Ã‡O THE GEORGIA REVIEW expense of other co-ordinate departments of intellectual pursuits" and had "very rightly provoked some reaction among conservative think- ers." Especially among the religious, there was a "vague dread of the result." Some, in fact, were intoxicated with the hope of the "speedy advent of a society regenerated by science" and were ready to cut loose from the past, from religion, art and social organization and try to rebuild on the new foundations. Really pseudo-scientists, these self- styled scientific philosophers and social reformers were so convinced in mind that they were "impenetrable to any other view." People had supposed that dogmatism was the "pre-empted right of Theology," but the new scientific philosophers had "jumped the claim." In the existing state of transition, LeConte called for a rational spirit which was willing to accept "eternal change by evolution as a law." He called for a rearrangement of mental furniture to a new and higher order, including, in some cases, the throwing out of the "external shell of dogmas and creeds." Evolution, he declared, did not destroy the old; it said that the old was transformed into the new. A rational spirit broke down hard and fast lines and substituted gradations. It envisioned eternal growth instead of sudden creations. Dogmatism and partisan- ship could not live in its presence, for it was "the very spirit of tolerance in religion and politics." "Science," he concluded, "has come, not to destroy but to fulfill and verify all that is best and truest in our faiths and aspirations, and thus to purify and ennoble both art and religion."23 In his Autobiography , LeConte wrote that he looked back with especial pleasure on his writings about evolution. Claiming the discovery of no new facts bearing on evolution, he, nevertheless, felt that he had helped explain its nature and scope more clearly and, especially, had shown "its true relation to religious thought." Lamarck, he said, had introduced evolution as a scientific theory; Darwin had presented it in such a way as to be acceptable to the scientific mind; Huxley had won its acceptance by the intelligent popular mind; Spencer had generalized it into a universal law of Nature. He himself, along with other Americans, had shown that a "materialistic implication" was "wholly unwarranted," that evolution was "entirely consistent with a rational theism and with other fundamental religious beliefs." At first he had been a reluctant evolutionist, but he had later become an enthusiastic one because, of all the laws of Nature, evolution was "by far the most religious, that is, the most in accord with religious phi- losophic thought." Since his efforts to show that evolution was not</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH LECONTE Ã‡ I materialistic began in 1871, he maintained that he was the "pioneer in the reaction against the materialistic and irreligious implications of the doctrine of evolution." At first, the extreme orthodox had been critical of his views; but, over the years, he had seen "all intelligent clergymen" come to his position. Because of the impact of his writings about evolution, he regarded them as the "most important" of his works.24 Notes William Dallam Armes, ed., Autobiography of Joseph LeConte (New York: D.
