<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tijdschrifi voor Filosofie, 64/2002, p. 697-722 KARMIC DARWINISM: THE EMERGING ALLIANCE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION by Steve FULLER (Warwick) How will the relationship between science and religion change, as biol- ogy replaces physics as the cutting edge scientific discipline in the 21st century? From political interest and financial investment to philosophical debate and media attention, one paradigm shift is undeniable: The mol- ecular biology lab has replaced the particle accelerator as the preferred place of scientific worship. The profound implications for religion have begun to be strongly felt but remain inadequately understood. Christians, Muslims, and Jews are legitimately concerned about what the activist Jer- emy Rifkin has called our emerging "bio tech century" (Rifkin 1998). But the challenge comes not from science per se, but from an elective affinity between Neo-Darwinian science, biotechnology, and the three "karmic" religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The basis of this affinity, which I call Karmic Darwinism, would reduce the difference between humans and other life forms, thereby minimizing the significance of hu- manity's place in nature. Steve FULLER [1959], originally trained in history and philosophy of science, is Professor of Sociology at the University of Warwick, England. He is most closely associated with the research program of social epistemology, and is the author of seven books, including Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times (Chicago, 2000).</page><page sequence="2">698 Steve FULLER Generally speaking, it is not helpful to talk about "science versus relig- ion." Historians of science nowadays agree that this conflict first became vivid in Europe and America only in the last quarter of the 19th century, when Darwin's defenders explicitly challenged theology for control of the universities (Brooke 1991). Consider the two original icons of the anti- religious defense of science, Galileo and Voltaire. Neither opposed theo- logical control of the universities. Galileo simply wanted theology to ad- just its doctrine in light of scientific discoveries, whereas Voltaire was content to operate from "academies" that enjoyed royal immunity from the theologians. In contrast, Thomas Henry Huxley aggressively cam- paigned to bring the natural sciences into the center of the university. However, a more common tactic, as JJ. Clarke (1997) has observed, is for self-styled vanguard scientific thinkers to play off alternative theologies against each other. Specifically, Eastern ideas and practices have been ap- propriated as intellectual leverage against what Westerners took to be re- actionary, often specifically Christian, positions. Sometimes this strategic appropriation left a lasting impression on Western thought. For example, in the late 17th century, Gottfried von Leibniz cited Chinese ideograms as an inspiration for his project of a universal language of thought, which as "symbolic logic" became one of the signature developments of modern Western philosophy. The next inter- religious struggle for the soul of science will be radically different from the one waged over physics in the past century. Then a broad spectrum of scientists and humanists - including Niels Bohr, Jo- seph Needham, Carl Jung, and Fritjof Capra - argued that such Chi- nese concepts as ch' li, and tao offered the holistic metaphysical back- ground needed for a comprehensive appreciation of the more cosmic implications of the revolutions in relativity and quantum physics. These concepts clearly situated the observer in the world observed, thereby under- mining the detached, perhaps even alienated, "view from nowhere" that was presupposed by classical mechanics, itself modeled on Isaac Newton's understanding of the standpoint of the Christian deity toward his Crea- tion.</page><page sequence="3">KARMIC DARWINISM 699 However, as the disciplinary focus shifts from physics to biology, so too will the source of Eastern metaphysical inspiration - specifically from China to India. If the 20th century was marked by a struggle between broadly "mechanistic" and "holistic" world-views, the 21st century will witness a conflict between anthropic and karmic perspectives. The issue here turns on whether human beings are "created in the image and like- ness of God," and hence enjoy a normatively privileged position in na- ture. The great monotheistic religions of the West are agreed on this point, whereas the great pantheistic and polytheistic religions of the East deny it. Metaphysically at stake is no less than the idea that reality is a single unified entity, that is, literally a universe and not a pluriverse (Collins 1998: Epilogue). I use the word "karmic" to typify the antithesis in the emerging dialec- tic because of its resemblance to the function performed by "genetic" in popular accounts of evolutionary biology. "Karma" is perhaps best ren- dered as "life force." This has the advantage of covering karma's multi- farious functions. Indicative of the karmic features of popular "gene talk" are the following four claims: (a) that one's own actions are somehow constrained by past lives, be it as a potential or a necessary determinant; (b) that actions can be taken in one's own lifetime (often related to life- style) to mitigate, but not completely eliminate, the worst aspects of one's legacy; (c) that there is no inter-generational or inter-species sense of pro- gress, unless the goal is defined as physical extinction; (d) that the life force is common to all life forms, regardless of surface differences in ap- pearance and emotional attachment. The closest ancient Western tradi- tion to the karmic sensibility is atomism and the associated ethical doc- trine of Epicureanism, which espoused the minimization of suffering in the face of the irreducible contingency of things. We shall see that the karmic spirit runs deep in the Neo-Darwinian synthesis in evolutionary biology. It certainly helps to explain the knee- jerk Darwinian resistance to an idea that seems perfectly acceptable to most Americans, namely, that evolution itself may be a product of a di- vinely inspired "intelligent design," which humans are especially well-</page><page sequence="4">700 Steve FULLER placed to fathom, complete, and/or master. But of course, Darwinians are not consistently karmic. Otherwise, they would be forced to conclude that their own theory is no more than a locally adaptive chance occur- rence that rashly generalizes from an incomplete and unrepresentative fossil record to eons of natural history. Indeed, this is precisely the critique of the explanatory value of evolutionary theory offered by the dissident "cladistic" school of taxonomists (Gee 1997). As it turns out, Darwinians harbor an anthropic residue. The processes of evolution are conveniently divided, so that room is made for intelligent design, but only once homo sapiens takes control of heretofore species- blind processes. In truly homo ex machina fashion, our scientific pursuits over the last 300 years have somehow managed to acquire an unprece- dented sense of purpose and progress that has culminated in the Neo- Darwinian synthesis. In philosophical parlance, this position is known as "convergent scientific realism." But to those with an historical memory, it is simply an updated version of 19th century natural theology - minus any explicit reference to God. Certainly, this was the intention of Charles Sanders Peirce, the founder of American pragmatism, when he invented convergent scientific realism. Not surprisingly, this dualistic treatment of the role of design in nature has exposed Darwinians to embarrassment from, so to speak, "above" and "below." From "above," academic humanists are increasingly attracted to karmic accounts of the history of science that threaten to deconstruct the Neo-Darwinian double-think that would grant to scientifically inclined humans precisely the purposiveness denied to other life forms and nature as such (Latour 1993). In this respect, a completely consistent Darwinian would adhere to an epistemology closer to postmodernists who would reduce all universal knowledge claims - including their own - to tem- porarily effective, self-serving narratives. From "below," eco- warriors and animal liberationists actively campaign to return Darwin to the karmic fold by putting a halt to experimental genetics research and other displays of "speciesist hubris" that would seem to place the welfare of humans above that of other creatures. In popular science writing, the karmic roots</page><page sequence="5">KARMIC DARWINISM 701 of contemporary evolutionary biology are alloyed with misdirected rhet- oric, which has fueled the imaginations of readers while diverting them from the overall thrust of the authors' arguments. The authors I have in mind here - E.O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and Peter Singer - are listed in increasing order of commitment to the consequences of a karmic view of evolution. I place Wilson at the low end because he is the popular evolutionist with the most explicit anthropic sensibilities. These may reflect his strong Baptist roots, which first inspired him to seek order in nature through the study of ant societies, a project that in the mid-1970s he christened "so- ciobiology" (Wilson 1975). Yet, despite having paid his dues to the Neo- Darwinian cause, Wilson was roundly condemned by fellow Darwinians when he tried to renovate the "unity of science" ideal in his 1998 best- seller, Consilience (Wilson 1998). The very word "consilience" suffered from religious taint. It was coined by William Whewell, a mid- 19th cen- tury Cambridge don who sought unity through a combined commitment to geology and holy orders. Today Whewell is mainly remembered (minus his religious interests) as a founder of the historical and philosophical study of science, though in his own day he was best known for cham- pioning the inclusion of the experimental sciences in the university cur- riculum as an aid to natural theology (Fuller 2000: chap. 1). Whewell, it must be said, also criticized Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selec- tion for rendering the unity of the natural order more mysterious than ever. I shall return to this criticism - also lodged by John Stuart Mill - toward the end of this paper. That Wilson does not share Whewell's doubts about Darwin has not stopped him from carrying some of Whewell's conceptual baggage. This is best exemplified in the title of Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, On Human Nature (Wilson 1978). The idea of human nature is an anachronism in Neo-Darwinian times. It harks back to Aristotle's doc- trine of species essentialism, which historically has provided a strong basis for humans being raised (metaphysically) and raising themselves (morally) above the animals. To be sure, the Aristotelian doctrine has not died a</page><page sequence="6">702 Steve FULLER quiet death. We need only consider the continuing attempts - say, by Noam Chomsky and Jürgen Habermas - to accord a privileged status to humans by virtue of our (allegedly) unique species capacity for language. True Darwinians find such appeals quaint but hopelessly outdated, since humans differ in degree, not kind, from other life forms. Indeed, for the Darwinian, it is only a matter of time before we discover that the com- munication systems of other creatures are just as syntactically regular and semantically rich as human language. Here the history of research into human language sets an illuminating precedent, since it has been only over the past half century that all nor- mal-brained human beings have been themselves accorded equal status as language users. In our post-Chomsky world, it is easily forgotten that tra- ditionally languages have been regarded as "equals" only in the sense of being equally adequate to the environments in which they are regularly used, not equally complex or creative as cognitive instruments in general. In this respect, even a perspective as seemingly enlightened as the Sapir- Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity implied that the capacity for thought is so tightly bound with the language normally spoken that one could explain people's differential capacities to understand, say, the cos- mology underlying the Einsteinian universe in terms of the ease with which it can be articulated in one's native language (Fuller 1988: Appen- dix B). The frisson created by this hypothesis was its suggestion that some non-European languages (such as Hopi) may be syntactically better equipped than European ones for articulating recent conceptual innova- tions in science, such as Einstein's cosmology. But at most, this was an argument for the untapped capacity of particular languages to access par- ticular aspects of reality, not for the capacity of all languages to access all of reality. Making the empirical case for the equality of all human languages re- quired going beyond Chomsky's own application of largely philosophical arguments to the standard grammars of European languages. The ulti- mate challenge was provided by so-called sub-standard dialects, such as Black American English (now called "Ebonics"), which were examples of what the British sociolinguist Basil Bernstein had called "restricted codes"</page><page sequence="7">KARMIC DARWINISM 703 because of their seemingly limited expressive capacities. Generally speak- ing, the challenge was met by loosening the concept of syntax so as to incorporate what a more traditionally trained linguist like Chomsky might regard as elements of the environment in which language is used. Thus, attention to the mode and tempo of speech could be shown to pro- vide an additional level of syntactic complexity that might otherwise go unnoticed. This enabled randomly distributed grammatical errors to be reinterpreted as the expression of systematically different norms. Crucial to this transformation in perspective was both a greater appreciation of the paradigmatic situations in which, say, Black American English is normally used and more general self-criticism by linguists who had tradi- tionally isolated the cognitive from the social functions of language (Cole 1996: chap. 8). This transformation in the protocols of linguistics research has grad- ually seeped into animal behavior studies, especially primatology, leading to a radical reappraisal of the potential for animal communication. The views of a structural anthropologist like Claude Levi-Strauss have been effectively turned on their head. Instead of regarding social structure as a projection of cognitive structure, it is increasingly common to regard cog- nitive structure as the internalization - or better still, "simulation" - of social structure. Apes may be seen as engaging in complex logical oper- ations as they are forced to anticipate the complex contingencies governing their fellow apes' behaviors (Byrne and Whiten 1987). To be sure, apes still seem to lack the impulse to engage in pedagogy. In other words, the apes being simulated do not try to improve the efforts of the apes trying to simulate them - except in laboratory settings that fail to generalize to the native habitat (Premack and Premack 1994). But this failure to gener- alize is familiar. It had been invoked by defenders of the Sapir- Whorf hy- pothesis to show that different languages convey incommensurable worldviews. Universalists observed, in response, that with great study and preferably greater social intercourse, people may come to bridge such dif- ferences, if not completely integrate them. Nowadays, carrying this obser- vation to its logical conclusion, Neo-Darwinists would shift the burden of</page><page sequence="8">704 Steve FULLER proof to those who would not see this principle extended to bridge the gap between apes and humans. More generally, if the Neo-Darwinian synthesis were truly to colonize the popular imagination, the highly charged debates that Wilson and other social and biological scientists have had over the role of "nurture versus nature" in determining our humanity would disappear. Both Wil- son and his opponents continue to presuppose the anthropic idea that there is something quite special to explain about human beings, over which a disciplinary turf war is worth fighting (Rose and Rose 2000): Thus, should we look to genetics or sociology (or theology, for that mat- ter) to explain our linguistic capacity? All sides agree that non-humans exert relatively little control over their fate, but humanity's cumulative achievements provide a prima facie case for the formative role of up- bringing, experience, and will. However, were it shown that, in some sense, all species engage in communication, form societies, and perhaps even harbor spirituality, then the metaphysical point of adjudicating be- tween "nature" and "nurture" would start to evaporate. Even the sociol- ogists for whom Wilson normally has nothing but scorn have begun to take the hint: A section on "Animals and Society" has been recently char- tered by the American Sociological Association (Patterson 2002). Wilson's original entry into the Neo-Darwinian fold via natural history, rather than genetics, may help to explain his anthropic residue, which tends to be stronger in evolutionists whose study of cross-species patterns is focused on behavior rather than genes. An ant colony looks like an evolutionary prototype for a human society. However, the temptation to treat non-humans as inferior versions of humans weakens once organisms are regarded as simply a string of amino acids rather than individuals, however interdependent, that appear clearly defined to the naked eye (Fuller 1993: chap. 3). After all, from a genetic standpoint, there is a 90%+ overlap in the constitution of humans and all other animals - 97%+ in the case of primates. If our understanding of what Wilson (1992) originally called "biodiversity" is grounded in these genetic facts, then it is easy to see how Darwinians would come to regard our "unique-</page><page sequence="9">KARMIC DARWINISM 705 ness" a chimera born of our greater familiarity with humans vis-à-vis other life forms. A goal of biological science, then, would be to redress this im- balance in our knowledge, thereby dispelling the anthropic chimera, which in the karmic tradition would be an instance of maya, namely, the illusion of difference that instills feelings of superiority and inferiority, the source of all misery, according to the West's most profound karmic phil- osopher, Arthur Schopenhauer. This brings us to the second major source of misdirection, Richard Dawkins, the Oxford zoologist who is perhaps Britain's most famous atheist. He cannot be seen, as Wilson might, as sublimating any original religious impulses in the Neo-Darwinian synthesis. Rather, Dawkins writes too well for his own good - at least in terms of his ability to make Darwin continuous with common sense. His quarter-century campaigns on behalf of the "selfish gene" and the "gene's eye-view of the world" are usually read as overstretched metaphors that have left many readers with the impression that we are genetically programmed to be selfish (Dawkins 1976). But the impression is false. Read closely, Dawkins' message is the much more karmic: Individual organisms, including humans, are ulti- mately vehicles that genes construct to reproduce themselves. Thus, what- ever we do - altruistic or selfish - is simply a by-product of these larger genetic machinations. The implicit cosmology here is closer to the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, than anything found in the Bible. Dawkins' "selfish gene" is meant to be taken literally. However, it would be a mistake to lay all the blame for the misdirection caused by the selfish gene metaphor on Dawkins himself. Neo-Darwinian researchers have yet to fully come to grips with the karmic character of their own theory. For example, Dawkins' mentor at Oxford, the late W.D. Hamilton, was preoccupied with the explanation of altruistic be- havior, which he regarded as an anomaly for the Neo-Darwinian syn- thesis. His solution - that altruism results from one organism enabling others of its kin to reproduce their common genes - is among the most elegant in modern theoretical biology. Nevertheless, Hamilton seemed to suppose that ordinary selfish behavior is more easily explained by the Neo-Darwinian synthesis, when in fact it is not. Strictly speaking, it is a</page><page sequence="10">706 Steve FULLER matter of genetic indifference whether particular individuals are selfish or altruistic. (For Hamilton's influence on Dawkins, see Segerstrale 2000: chap. 4). Of course, much of the original support for Darwin's Origin of the Spe- cies came from those, like Herbert Spencer, who read it as a naturalized version of Adam Smith's "invisible hand" argument for the conversion of private vices into public virtue. Smith himself had justified the long-term survival of selfish behavior in terms of the realization that one's own inter- ests are best served by serving the interests of others. But notwithstanding the dreams of eugenicists, nothing in the Neo-Darwinian synthesis sug- gests that these capitalist calculations are directly inscribed on the genetic code. With the recruitment of Mendel's theory of inheritance in the early 20th century, Darwin's followers began to differentiate sharply an organ- ism's manifest ("phenotypic") and latent ("genotypic") traits, between which only statistical relations can obtain. Even Dawkins admits that the most we can affect the course of evolution is by an "extended phenotype" that alters the environment in which genes are naturally selected (Dawkins 1982). In effect, a parallel sub-universe was created, called "genetics," that is governed by a hand even less visible than Smith's. Long-term genetic sur- vival is not merely a happy knock-on effect of locally advantageous be- havior. Rather, it is the result of factors, of which humans have only limited control and slightly less limited understanding. It is fine for Darwinians to say that rational agents aim to maximize the reproduction of their genes, but they have precious little to say about exactly how this is to be done, especially in relation to what agents would recognize as their self-interest. This sort of "rationality" amounts to a throw of a dice whose loading can only be guessed. At best, one can play it safe and minimize the worst possible outcomes, say, by neutralizing genes for physical dis- abilities. In any case, by the time we get to Dawkins' talk of selfish genes, we have left Adam Smith's defense of rational self-interest in the mists of our Enlightenment past. (For a somewhat surprising philosophical de- fence of this pessimistic view of science's meliorative capacities, see Kitcher2001).</page><page sequence="11">KARMIC DARWINISM 707 Here we arrive at the third source of Neo-Darwinian misdirection, Peter Singer, who is often portrayed in the mass media as the world's most influential and dangerous living philosopher. I believe his influence has only begun to be felt. Singer, an Australian who was recently appointed to a chair in ethics at Princeton, first burst on the scene a quarter-century ago with Animal Liberation, an eloquent defence of the animal rights movement (Singer 1975). Unlike most professional phil- osophers, Singer has pursued his species egalitarianism with equal vigor in technical and public forums. Moreover, few other philosophers can boast of having increased the sophistication, ambition, and popularity of their position over time. Nevertheless, Singer has bought into gene talk to such an extent that he now attributes the decline of Marxism - with which he had been previously sympathetic - to its failure to acknowledge the genetic barriers to altruism. Singer's recent attempt to launch a "Darwinian Left" successor to Marxism turns out to be a rather remarkable feat of karmic politics (Singer 1999). He takes as axiomatic several propositions that connect Epicurus with the first modern utilitarian, Jeremy Bentham: All sensa- tions are created equal, and they afford either positive or negative utility to their bearer. The bearers experience these sensations as "pleasure" and "pain." Moreover, the bearers themselves are entitled to equal treatment as alternative forms assumed by the same fundamental matter. In this context, it is often forgotten just how close Bentham was to Singer's own position. For example, Bentham's quip that human rights are "nonsense on stilts" was not merely a proto-positivist swipe at metaphysical justifica- tions in politics but a concrete complaint about the role that inflated views of humanity had in the law's failure to recognize cruelty to animals. Bentham went as far as to ask in Principles of Morals and Legislation: "Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?" The subsequent apostasy by Bentham's godson, John Stuart Mill, provides a perfect example of how one person's "sensitivity" constitutes another's "coarseness." Moral philosophers today generally presume that Mill's an- thropic sensibility is an improvement over Bentham's karmic one, if not the final word on ethics. In this respect, Singer may be credited with pro-</page><page sequence="12">708 Steve FULLER viding a Benthamite rejoinder to Mill's preference for a dissatisfied So- crates over a satisfied pig by ranking a fully functioning pig over a disabled Socrates. Singer's answer to Mill is made all the more insidious by its sup- posed basis on a scientifically improved understanding of life. When Singer is hailed as a pioneer in ethics, it is usually for his radical redefinition of the summum bonum in terms of the alleviation of cosmic suffering, as opposed to the specific improvement of human welfare. For Singer, an increased understanding of biology enables us to anticipate and eliminate potential sources of suffering without adding still more misery to the world. In pre-scientific times, the classic path of least resistance in this sense was suicide. Euthanasia and abortion were always more contro- versial because they necessarily involve the cooperation of others who may themselves suffer in the process. However, these objections began to lose some of their force, as moral and legal status came to be associated with "rights" that are exclusive to individuals. Singer is very much part of that tradition, which tends to downplay the social distribution of pleasure and pain. Thus, Singer's paramount concern is that each individual, regardless of species membership and more specific group ties, be both protected from gratuitous suffering and relieved of any such suffering as efficiently as possible (Singer 1994). The advancement of biomedicai science plays a curiously inconsistent role in Singer's world-view. It certainly helps reduce the difference in moral worth assigned to humans and other animals by raising our aware- ness of the levels of sentience and intelligence possessed by animals, not to mention the significant genetic overlap between them and us. However, these insights had been often gained by means that Singer and his fellow animal rights activists now condemn, namely, laboratory experiments that incarcerate animals long enough to inflict pain on them. The irony is compounded by the fact that Singer's high estimation of chimpanzees is heavily based on their sign language performance, even though sign lan- guage was itself originally developed to serve the needs of sensorily dis- abled humans who today Singer would prefer to have subject to prenatal termination (Ree 1999).</page><page sequence="13">KARMIC DARWINISM 709 In short, Singer is fortunate to be living now, for had he lived a century earlier, he would never have supported the research that gives his ethics its scientific veneer. Instead, he would have probably followed in Arthur Schopenhauer's footsteps. Singer shares Schopenhauer's pessimistic ap- praisal of humanity's capacity for moral growth: At our most intelligent, we cause the least pain. Not surprisingly, Schopenhauer was more im- pressed by the recent German translation of the Upanishads than by the directions being taken by 1 9th century biomedicai research. This research, often appearing in the guise of "positivism," presumed that humans are in a unique position to increase the world's overall good, not merely mini- mize its worst effects. Specifically, progress is characterized by our collec- tive capacity to adapt to those humans who deviate significantly from physical and moral norms. Unlike Schopenhauer, and Singer after him, the positivists did not regard humanity as an abject condition, but a pro- ject in the making. However, the continuity between positivism and the anthropic relig- ious spirit is easily overlooked. In its day, and especially in the hands of its megalomaniacal founder, Auguste Comte, positivism promised a "religion of humanity" that openly competed with the Roman Catholic Church (Wernick 2001). This institutional challenge has left lasting scars, not least the lingering popular impression that science and religion are natural enemies. To be sure, Christians were rankled by positivism's blasphemous conflation of the divine and the human. Nevertheless, with the advantage afforded by hindsight, positivism might be now credited with having taken the anthropic character of Christianity with a seriousness that is lacking in the normative lessons drawn from Darwin by Peter Singer and his followers. Ironically, the great monotheistic religions and their mod- ern secular foils are natural allies against Darwinism's more karmic ten- dencies. Positivism extended a message common to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam: That the weakest and most despised of our kind are to be cherished and learned from, not simply eliminated as unfortunate freaks of nature (Maclntyre 1999). Updating the theodicy of Saint Irenaeus, the leading early Patristic philosopher, positivists tended to regard these apparently</page><page sequence="14">710 Steve FULLER negative turns in the human condition as occasions of, in Mill's words, "constructive unhappiness" designed to spur humanity as a whole to a higher level of being. This sensibility informed a wide range of 19th cen- tury cultural innovations. In politics, it motivated Mill's liberal defence of minority dissent. In a rapidly democratizing political scene, the endan- gered "freaks of nature" extended beyond physically challenged individ- uals who might be seen as a "burden" on the able-bodied. They also in- cluded social and intellectual non-conformists who add friction to the smooth - and hence mindless - reproduction of the social order. Since only a swing in popular opinion potentially determines whether deviants are regarded as geniuses or "enemies of the people," as Ibsen would say, they were all equally in need of special protection and cultivation. In medicine, positivism was influential in focusing the physician's charge specifically on the preservation of human life, instead of the facili- tation of "nature's course," which had allowed a good bedside manner to slip into acts of euthanasia. Here the French tradition of clinical medicine from Xavier Bichat, who merited a prominent place in Comte's calendar of positivist saints, to Claude Bernard inspired a redefinition of death as the exhaustion of life, which may be forestalled through organized scien- tific resistance (Albury 1993). Moreover, the positivist legacy lurks in Singer's own project of expanding the moral order to encompass all ani- mals. "Animal rights" are modeled on the extension of civil rights to groups who traditionally did not own property, especially women and workers. Here positivists championed alternative indicators of compet- ence, which by the second half of the 19th century had led to the imple- mentation of literacy tests and the development of sign language as means for enlarging the sphere of civil society (Ree 1999). Interestingly, positivists have always regarded Darwinism with ambiva- lence. They embraced the theory only insofar as it encouraged humans to improve their condition. Thus, positivists have been keen on projects of education, subsidization, rehabilitation - and, yes, behavior modifica- tion and genetic manipulation. This multifacetedness was epitomized in the career of Karl Pearson, the founder of applied statistics and the first self-declared positivist to hold an academic chair in Britain. Moreover,</page><page sequence="15">KARMIC DARWINISM 711 positivists have been mindful of the lessons to be drawn from genetic mutations, the Darwinian basis for new varieties and even species of or- ganisms. If it only takes the right environmental conditions for these im- probable beings to reproduce themselves, then why cannot these condi- tions be humanly created and thereby potentially enhance the overall state of humanity? Modern biomedicai research owes much to this sentiment. What positivists found unacceptable in Darwinism was any karmic suggestion that an organism can do little to alter its fit to the environment - that we are simply born to our fate. Often this has been used to show that positivists were beholden to an outdated view of evolution that owed more to the Utopian biologist Lamarck than Darwin himself. Again John Stuart Mill sets a perceptive precedent. Mill was among the critics of Darwin's Origin of the Species when it was first published in 1859. He criticized the book for overemphasizing the contingently diverse character of nature, about which humans can do very little but observe and adapt to its passage. A liberal with strong welfarist tendencies, Mill was sensitive to Origins immediate adoption by defenders of laissez-faire social and econ- omic policies, who could now boast that Nature itself demonstrated the futility of subsidizing those who persistently fail to survive by their own means. Here it is worth recalling that the intellectual lineage from Thomas Malthus to Charles Murray runs right through Charles Darwin. But Mill's proposed philosophical antidote turned out, for most Chris- tians of the day, to be just as bad as the disease it purported to cure (Sell 1997). In the first place, Mill wanted to jettison the traditional distinction between "nature" and "artifice" that Darwin reinforced with a vengeance. For Mill, God and humans are both creative beings, and what is normally called "nature" is simply the raw material of their joint creation. A unified world-view, the goal of modern science, does not aim to represent the original divine plan. Rather, according to Mill, it is the human comple- tion of the project begun by God. Implied here was the idea that God is all good but not all powerful. Thus, what humans experience as ignorance and pain are ultimately invitations to bring God's work to fruition. They are most certainly not direct expressions of divine wishes or insurmount-</page><page sequence="16">712 Steve FULLER able barriers to human progress - two common meanings of "nature" that Mill thought Darwinism would bolster. As Comte's most sympathetic British reader, Mill was typically re- garded by the Christians of his day as trying to implant the positivist re- ligion of humanity on British soil. But now that positivism no longer poses a credible threat to Christianity, we might be better placed to ap- preciate what had attracted Mill to Comte's weakened deity. The virtue that Comte himself stressed was that his vision of God is not reducible to sheer power-worship. Here Comte meant to oppose the tendency of autocrats, both before and after the French Revolution, to justify their policies by appeals to divine omnipotence and omniscience. Today a similar sense of power-worship is most likely to flow from science, es- pecially when our current scientific understanding is frozen into the meta- physical ground on which life and death judgments are made. Indeed, what both Comte and Mill would find most distressing in Singer's "scien- tifically informed" preference for a healthy pig over a congenitally diseased human is its finality: Singer assumes such an elevated view of what we now know that we are effectively discouraged from finding out more - especially if it might eventuate in a reversal of current preferences. It is one thing to confront Darwinians like Singer with the specters of positivists past, but quite another to take forward the anthropic religious vision into the 21st century. I shall conclude by discussing the difficulties that arise on the religious, the political, and the scientific sides of this project. The first problem is the continuing theological tendency to stress the similarities or complementarities, rather than the outright doctrinal con- flicts, among the world religions. This "ecumenism" typically presupposes an untenably sharp distinction between science and religion that corre- sponds, roughly, to mutually exclusive spheres of "fact" and "value." Consequently, it is held that we all share the same ultimate values but our means divide us. Here it is worth recalling that what made the ecumenical religious perspective so compelling in the first place was the rather uni- form role that advanced science and technology appeared to play in ex-</page><page sequence="17">KARMIC DARWINISM 713 ploitation and militarization across the globe in the 20th century. Relig- ious leaders rightly united against these common threats. But in the pro- cess they suppressed significant value disagreements that matter once we no longer live in a world of "mutually assured destruction." Specifically, does human life always take precedence over other forms of life? The anthropic and karmic religions offer opposing answers to this question. Contemporary political science also obscures the issues raised here. The problem is epitomized in Samuel Huntington^ The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order (Huntington 1996). In this analysis of the post-Cold War world, the perennial clash between "East" and "West" is recast in terms of religiously based civilizations, with Islam placed pivotally on the side of the "East" as the most powerful "anti-democratic" civilization, whose growing numbers pose the biggest long-term threat to global stability. Despite its influence in US foreign policy circles, Huntingdon's analysis continues the mind-set that Edward Said criticized in his classic, Orientalism, namely, the tendency of modern Christian and secular writers to project whatever they have found disturbing in their own culture to their spiritual cousins, the Jews and especially the Muslims (Said 1978). The common religious ancestry opens a rhetorical space for assertions of "progress," "decline," and indeed, "clash" within a single spiritual trajectory. However, the emerging dialectic between the anthropic and karmic perspectives is bound to be manifested more indirectly. This is not merely because it counterposes world-views with relatively independent doctrinal roots in the great Western and Eastern religions. More to the point, citi- zens are likely to find themselves in conflict with their own states, as per- sonal lifestyle and research choices run up against larger public interest issues. In these coming domestic clashes, the state - and the social sciences that inform and legitimate its actions - is positioned to be a consistent defender of humanity against individuals and groups whose attachments to their fellow citizens vis-à-vis other animals may be subject to considerable variability. Indeed, the idea of the state as the institutional vehicle for consolidating human dominion over nature lay behind the historic alternative to Malthus' dismal demographic prognosis. I refer here</page><page sequence="18">714 Steve FULLER to the Marquis de Condorcet, who viewed the proliferation of humans as a stimulus to progress, whereby artifice is used to overcome the insuffi- ciency of nature (Rothschild 2001). To be sure, this rather optimistic view of population growth can be found not only among the positivists, but also Hegel and Marx, as well as such latter-day theologically inspired scientists as the paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and the geneti- cist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1967). In terms of the specifically scientific problems surrounding the an- thropic vision, I alluded earlier to the affinity between the karmic side of the Neo-Darwinian synthesis and postmodernism. Unfortunately, in the ongoing "Science Wars," postmodernists are demonized as "anti-science" (e.g. Sokal and Bricmont 1998). This is a grave error. Not only do post- modernists tend to be openly enthusiastic (though perhaps ill-informed) about recent science, but more importantly, they are quite happy to re- nounce the sorts of assumptions that have traditionally privileged humans over other animals. These were notoriously crystallized in the 1960s, first by the literary critic Roland Barthes as "the death of the author" and then generalized by Michel Foucault as "the death of the subject." Both drew on the abject condition of humanity portrayed by Sigmund Freud and Martin Heidegger, who were, in turn, profoundly affected by Friedrich Nietzsche's "death of God" thesis. All of these thinkers shared a sense of futility about our ability to significantly alter the human condition. This karmic sensibility has subsequently had a debilitating effect on the "aca- demic left." A good semantic indicator is how "politically correct" thinkers nowadays aim for "resistance" rather than "revolution," "difference" rather than "progress," etc. In each case, the first term is a more oblique and less ambitious successor of the second. The idea of a project that is at once universal, collective, and creative seems to have been lost in the translation. But the problems here run deeper than humanist interpretations of re- cent science. The scientific research agenda itself displays karmic tenden- cies. Singer's attempt to peg animal rights to sentience and intelligence has yet to be generally seen as a threat to the value of human life because our understanding of animals is sufficiently limited that cross-species at-</page><page sequence="19">KARMIC DARWINISM 715 tributions of feeling and thought remain relatively restricted. However, with advances in ethology, sociobiology, and most recently, "evolutionary psychology," an increasing number of animals turn out to be increasingly sentient and intelligent. Moreover, this curious development cannot be explained simply in terms of wanton anthropomorphism. Two rather different things seem to be working in consort. First, animals are being studied more closely than in the past. This has involved both improved research methodology and an increased level of sympathy. But it is un- clear that the two can be neatly separated: The former may be a self- reinforcing product of the latter (Crist 1999). Second, our conceptions of sentience and intelligence have become more abstract, perhaps even alien- ated, as scientists develop more powerful computer models of sensory perception and problem-solving. Even when these models do not figure explicitly in biological research, their general presence has helped to at- tenuate the intuitive tendency to judge animals by anthropic standards. Darwinians generally do not issue judgments on nature's normative trajectory, but when they do venture into this traditional ground of natu- ral theology, they speak against the anthropic vision. A natural entry point is E.O. Wilson's concept of biodiversity, mentioned earlier. Wilson fol- lows the trail of population theorists from Malthus to Paul Ehrlich, who have assumed that a normatively desirable natural order is to be had by maximizing the range of species, even if it requires the curtailment of spontaneous reproductive tendencies (Schwartzman 1995). In its extreme form, the underlying principle is that the life of any individual is never equal to that of an entire species, whatever the species. Informing this intuition is the spin given to what ecologists call "Rapoport's Rule," ac- cording to which less biodiverse environments (typically temperate cli- mates) tend to be inhabited by species, such as cockroaches and humans, which can survive in many different environments, and hence have the potential to crowd out local species (Eldredge 1998). In other words, in Nature's economy, there seems to be a trade-off between the proliferation of individuals and species. The only remaining question, then, is just how much human intervention is needed - such as the enforced contracep- tion, sterilization, or termination of individuals - for the right balance to</page><page sequence="20">716 Steve FULLER be struck. Here Malthus and Ehrlich occupy, respectively, laissez-faire and dirigiste poles, with Wilson himself somewhere in the middle. An exceptionally pessimistic version of this sensibility may be found in Stephen Jay Gould's bestseller, Wonderful Life (Gould 1989). Gould ar- gues that the contemporary focus on biodiversity is too little too late. Gould takes the regulative ideal of Nature to involve the inclusion of the widest possible disparity in the basic blueprints for life, from which a di- verse range of species may then be constructed. From that standpoint, the Cambrian Era best approximated this ideal. The last 500 million years has been marked by a steady decline, which has only accelerated with the in- troduction of homo sapiens. Nevertheless, according to Gould, this decline is not merely ignored but often mistaken for genuine progress, as appar- ent "direction" in nature is acquired by gradually narrowing Nature's ca- pacity for self-expression. It is worth remarking that Gould clearly con- ceives of these blueprints in morphological rather than strictly genetic terms, since the "disparity" he values is probably the product of marginal differences in DNA. Here Gould harks back to a normative sensibility whose natural home is pre-Darwinian but post-Christian, a secularized recognition that we live in a "fallen" state of nature: say, natural history, circa 1750 to 1850. In this respect, Gould is more Cuvier the cata- strophist than Lamarck the meliorist. But why should the human trajec- tory be judged in terms of Nature's overall expressive capacities? And even if this standard is appropriate, why cannot the human contribution be seen as providing a direction to Nature that it would otherwise lack? This is precisely how positivists would read the situation. For Comte or Mill, God experiments by creating alternative life-forms without knowing or controlling their fates. Progress, then, consists of the conversion of in- ter-species differences into intra-species ones, or, as economists would say in another context, "the internalization of externalities." In the positivist mind, a rather robust belief in the inheritance of acquired traits was joined to a Biblically inspired view of humanity as Nature's domesticator. To be sure, this perspective had some extreme precedents, such as the "missing link" arguments made by the Scottish Enlightenment jurist Lord Monboddo about the humanizability of orangutans under the right care</page><page sequence="21">KARMIC DARWINISM 717 and training (Ingold 1994). Nevertheless, even these apparent absurdities need to be judged by the policy implications historically associated with treating humans as just another part of the biological continuum. In his own day, Monboddo railed against David Hume's complacent racism, also known as "benign neglect," which treated humanity's various habi- tats, however rich or poor, as "natural" and hence best left undisturbed (Fuller 2001). As Darwinian natural selection forged tighter links with Mendelian genetics, species boundaries became so blurred that certain "race scientists," following the lead of Ernst Haeckel, argued that given their ratio of achievement to potential, higher order apes and African hu- mans may need to reverse positions in the evolutionary hierarchy (Proctor 1989: chap. 1). As the last example suggests, the removal of naturalized species distinc- tions opens the door to the normative transposition of individuals across what have now become conventional species boundaries. Sometimes this move has had arresting consequences. For example, race scientists in the interwar years - including Max Weber's great sociological rival, Werner Sombart - believed that Jews resembled cockroaches for reasons akin to Rapoport's Rule. Read as a normative principle, the Rule cast aspersions on highly mobile and multiply adaptive creatures, since their survival was at the expense of other creatures sharing the same environment. The abil- ity of such flexible creatures to extract much benefit from more locally embedded ones while contributing little in return marks them as "para- sites." In the specific case of Jews, their capacity for abstract thought pro- ceeded through the alienation of local forms of knowledge that was then resold to the locals as scientific expertise. In short, parasitism functioned as a racialized theory of surplus value (Stehr and Weinstein 1999). In light of this history, some of the more extreme "deep ecology" lit- erature that celebrates biodiversity may be understood - perhaps some- what uncharitably - as an extension of the above line of thinking about Jews to all of homo sapiens. Moreover, the connection between deep ecology and race science is not accidental. They were two sides of the Nazi quest for a "master lifestyle" suitable to a "master race," namely, care for the environment and care for the organism. The ecologically destabil-</page><page sequence="22">718 Steve FULLER izing effects of overpopulation were mirrored at the individual level by the lethal overproduction of cells that defined cancer as a disease (Proctor 1999). Crucial to both was the attempt to replace nature by artifice in the modalities of human existence, ranging from the manufacture of food to the design of buildings. The "deep" solution was for humans to abandon their species-based hubris and identify more fully with nature. Hence, the Nazis pioneered anti-pollution legislation, "organic" foods, and other ecologically friendly social policies that are today associated with the pros- perous and enlightened lifestyles practiced in northern California. Sociologically speaking, the most striking feature of the karmic sensi- bility's reabsorption of the human into the natural is its strengthening of the distinction between the normal and the pathological. More precisely, the distinction is recast in markedly aristocratic terms as the best versus the rest. Thus, as we saw most clearly in the case of Singer, an enforce- ment of equality across species requires greater discrimination within spe- cies. This, in turn, justifies a relatively permissive attitude toward the ter- mination of human and proto-human lives, as well as the high value placed on non-humans who seem to excel in qualities normally associated with humans. In effect, a series of ontological conversions are at work by which nature's plenitude is encompassed as a closed ecological system: It is as if nature as a whole were itself treated as one species, with all former species respecified as nature's constituent organisms. And what had been previously individual organisms would now appear as more or less func- tioning parts of this new superorganism called "Nature," with some devi- ant individuals acquiring the status of parasites or cancers. If this seems far-fetched, it is worth recalling that legal arguments for granting consti- tutional rights to animals typically presuppose that all humans already enjoy equal protection under the law unless they have been specifically excluded (Wise 1999). But, as a matter of fact, for a variety of reasons, large numbers of humans are excluded from such protection. Conse- quently, in opposing the formal recognition of animal rights, Germany's Christian Democratic Party has understandably argued that it would de- flect attention from the injustices that persist among classes of humans (Connolly 2002).</page><page sequence="23">KARMIC DARWINISM 719 Redressing the balance in favor of the anthropic perspective means breathing new life into the idea of human progress. But this will require taking the closeness of humans to God more seriously than many cur- rently seem prepared to do. Monotheists have been protective of the sanctity of human life, and hence have traditionally opposed suicide, euthanasia, and abortion, while their secular descendants in biomedicine have struggled to delay the moment of death as long as possible. Notice that both of these affirmative stances toward the human condition are primarily focused on the value of individual lives in their lifetimes. Yet, part of the privilege of being human is that we can take risks voluntarily on behalf of future generations. This may involve either heroic feats of self-sacrifice or rather more calculated investments in speculative financial ventures - neither of which always have salutary consequences. But in the wake of the Nazism's coercive experimentation on humans, we have become reluctant to include participation as subjects in scientific research as part of this life-enhancing risk-taking. Instead, we prefer to rely as much as possible on animal-based experiments, as if either humans were the only species afraid to die or animals should be regarded as mere means to human ends. This is neither good ethically nor epistemologically (La Follette and Shanks 1997). Of course, human health care has benefited from research that presup- poses significant genetic overlap between humans and other animals. However, an overestimation of this point, combined with an excessively short term, risk averse sensibility, is equally responsible for the medical disasters associated with, on the one hand, the widespread use of chemo- therapy and thalidomide and, on the other, the delay in recognizing the link between smoking and lung cancer (Greek and Greek 2002). So far the case against animal-based research has been mostly presented from the side of the incarcerated animals rather than the humans who are treated on the basis of the animal results. My concrete suggestion along these lines is that we should come to regard participation in scientific research - as either investigators or subjects - with the sense of civic duty tradi- tionally associated with jury membership, voting, and military service. In all these cases, humans organize themselves for a fixed period, sometimes</page><page sequence="24">720 Steve FULLER at personal risk, in order to affirm their joint commitment to a collective project. Traditionally this project has been pitched at the level of the nation- state, but I mean here to rekindle the positivist ideal of humanity as itself a collective project that cannot be realized by single individuals, but only together in opposition to a common foe, be it defined as ignorance or infirmity. The failure of modern politics, epitomized by the jurisprudence of Carl Schmitt, has been its continued stigmatization of fellow humans as necessary for the constitution of a republic. Consequently, the quest for universais in human knowledge and morals has been seen as orthogonal to - if not completely removed from - the particular divisions that seem necessary for political life. The ascendancy of the karmic sensibility in the new century threatens to exacerbate this tendency, only now with groups of humans and non-humans mobilized against other groups of humans and non-humans (Latour 1993). However, there is a historic precedent for reversing this prospect, namely, the perpetuation of in- stitutions whose self-defined and self-organized projects transcend bio- logical patterns of reproduction (e.g. the claims of family inheritance), resulting in a regular redistribution of wealth and power in society at large, with the aim of ever expanding and renewing the horizons of hu- manity. In Roman Law, such institutions were called universitates. Bibliography ALBURY, Randall (1993), Ideas of Life and Death. In: W.F. BYNUM and R.

The former is aligned with the major Western religions and was secularized in the 19 century as positivism, with its identification of social science with the religion of humanity. The latter is aligned with the major Eastern religions, but also Epicureanism in the West. It was secularized as the Neo-Darwinian synthesis in the 20th century, since when it has made major in- roads in wider precincts of normative thought. In this context, I focus specifically on the work of E.O. Wilson, Richard Dawkins, and Peter Singer - all of whom, in somewhat different ways, argue on naturalistic grounds for the removal of humanity's normative privilege. Moreover, the karmic sensibility enjoys somewhat surprising support from postmodern quarters, where anti-humanism tends to be strong. These emerging trends, even when articulated by scientists, have also been associated with a decline in scientific meliorism. Against all this, I argue for a reassertion of the anthropic perspective, mainly by suggesting how monotheists and positivists may join to reinstate the collective pro- ject of humanity. A crucial part of the strategy is to regard participation in science as a civic obligation, if not (à la Comte) a religious service.</page></plain_text>
