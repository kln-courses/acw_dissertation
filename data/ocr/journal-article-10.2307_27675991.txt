<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rolf J. Goebel University of Alabama in Huntsville Queer Berlin: Lifestyles, Performances, and Capitalist Consumer Society1 i "Ich bin schwul und das ist auch gut so!77 When Berlin7 s Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit used this memorable phrase during his election campaign to out himself, it seemed that being gay and being a prominent public figure was not only quite compatible but added an intriguing gender aspect to the capi tal^ aggressive self-promotion as a dynamic space for innovative self-inven tion. In his introductory essay to the collection Die bewegte Stadt, Thomas Kr?ger, who was a member of the first freely elected GDR Volkskammer and later active in SPD cultural politics, describes Berlin at the end of the 1990s as a "Stadt der Unentschiedenheit,77 where the social elites of both former part cities are undergoing rapid delegitimation and aging. Ghetto formation and social tensions are increasing while processes of suppressing harsh realities are beginning. Thus, melancholic and retrogressive attitudes are still dominant in the city. At the same time, however, after reunification many newcomers have appreciated the city as a tabula rasa for their own lifestyles and as a projection screen for new biographies and ideas, creating a professional and international culture of communication: "Berlin bietet in den Neunzigern als schnelles, vielf?ltiges und dynamisches Ideen-Labor beste Voraussetzungen f?r die individuelle Inszenierung v?llig unterschiedlicher und differierender Lebens stile.77 Explaining that the diversity of activities is particularly strong in the economic and cultural spheres, Kr?ger continues: "Das Experiment, das Spontane und Unkonventionelle, das Schr?ge und Wilde, kurz: das Indivi duelle ist gefragt77 ("Die bewegte Stadt77 22). The author7s language, vague and coolly assertive at the same time, seeks to capture the ambiguous and free-wheeling atmosphere of a pluralistic capital in transition that must con tinually negotiate its path, from the divided city with a ruinous past to its aspiring role as a metropolitan center, actively participating in late capitalist consumer society, cosmopolitan culture, and the global economy. Among the various lifestyles portrayed in Die bewegte Stadt we find Elmar Kraushaar 7s portrait of Oliver, who escapes from his provincial origins, lands a job in a large advertisement agency and finds himself a stable boyfriend. His The German Quarterly 79A (Fall 2006) 484</page><page sequence="2">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 485 easygoing lifestyle which features shopping sprees around Kurf?rstendamm is suddenly endangered when he is accosted by three young Turkish thugs in the subway. In response to the homophobic assault, Oliver defiantly decides that he wants to stay on in Berlin despite Turks and neo-Nazis, sublimating his anger by focusing on stereotypical aspects of a hedonistic gay consumer culture: "Er f?hlt sich wohl und stellt keine Diagnose. Er ist dabei, sich neu zu entwerfen und will nichts aus der Hand geben. Kein Zufall soll mehr da zwischen kommen, keine l?hmende Routine und keiner, der ihn bespuckt" (Kraushaar, "Oliver" 106). Oliver 7s story is emblematic for what it tells about the ideology of queer self-invention and lifestyles in the consumer capitalist society of post reunification Berlin. Yet the recent deluge of critical Berlin literature is marked by a curious absence of queer topics.2 If the proverbial symphony of the big city of Berlin really continues in the new millennium, then it often sounds like a heterosexist composition without the polyphony (and dissonances) of queer voices. This is all the more surprising considering the fact that the legiti mizing urban myth continually evoked by the new capitaPs quest for self identity centers mainly on the Weimar Republic, whose vitality, of course, rested in no small measure on its thriving gay culture.3 It is hard to say whether the lack of scholarly interest in queer Berlin is due to a tacitly heterosexist bias in German cultural studies, or whether queer issues are over shadowed by other important topics, such as German reunification, the Holo caust, the GDR legacy, or ethnic minority problems that dominate the debate on Berlin7s cultural significance. In light of this marginalization of queer issues in German Studies, I wish to pose the following questions: How can readings of queer Berlin texts contrib ute to our understanding of the post-reunification capital and its situation before the fall of the Wall? What are the specific representational strategies employed by recent queer literature for re-inventing and recycling urban im agery from the 1920s and 30s to the present? Are literary representations of gay desire and identities being co-opted by Berlin7s capitalist consumer cul ture, obsession with simulacra, and media industry, or can they develop a sub versive potential counteracting these cultural dominants? And, finally, how can the analysis of the intersection of queer textuality with Berlin's metropol itan space promote a metacritical reflection on the relative lack of contempo rary queer theory in German Studies? To address these questions I focus on four novels?Friedrich Kr?hnke7s Grundeis: Ein Fall (1990), Martin Schacht7s Mittendrin: Berlinroman (2002) to gether with its sequel Stra?en der Sehnsucht: Berlinroman (2003), and Peter Rehberg7s Fag Love (2005)?which seem to me symptomatic of what has by now emerged as an important tradition of gay-themed writings set in Berlin. This legacy can be traced at least as far back as Klaus Mann7s Der fromme Tanz (1925) and Christopher Isherwood7s Mr. Norris Changes Trains (1935) and</page><page sequence="3">486 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 Goodbye to Berlin (1939). It includes landmark autobiographical texts such as Napoleon Seyfarth7s Schweine m?ssen nackt sein (1991) and Charlotte von Mahlsdorfs Ich bin meine eigene Frau (1993) and Ab durch die Mitte (1994). In Joachim Helfer7s Cohn &amp; K?nig (1998), partly but at crucial moments set in the German capital, this tradition has attained one of its stylistically most bril liant achievements. The novels discussed in this essay are selected for their considerable formal and thematic diversity, which nonetheless is centered on the interplay of queer lifestyle performances with capitalist consumer society and its cultural traditions, a space that these performances negotiate through a complex dialectic of affirmation and subversion. I employ the expression "queer lifestyle performance77 in critical reference to Judith Butler's concept of gender performativity. In Gender Trouble (1990), she deconstructs the notion of gender as a natural or inherent quality of the self's core identity: "Gender is the repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of substance, of a natural sort of being" (33; see Jagose 83-93; Sullivan 81-98). Thus, the performative concept of gender posits that the signifying body and the self as the site of agency are not outside or prior to discursive regimes but are constituted by participating in them though com plex processes of citation, reiteration, and resignification. This account seeks to undermine essentialist notions of a stable human identity articulating it self through authentic acts of self-expression (Butler 142-49; Jagose 84).4 Drag, by theatricalizing the "contingent dimensions of significant corporeal ity: anatomical sex, gender identity, and gender performance," epitomizes the process of gender performativity through a specific act of denaturalizing per formance: "In imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure of gender itself?as well as its contingency" (Butler 137; italics in original). However, such performances are not entirely voluntary or autonomous, since the discourses and codes they actively reconfigure always already precede the subjectivity and will of the performer. In other words, performances enact individual self-articulations, desires, or cultural ideologies through preexisting practices, meanings, and values in the cultural archive. Or, as Butler puts it, "styles of being" (Sartre) are "never fully self-styled, for styles have a history, and those histories condition and limit the possibilities" of constructing the gendered self (Butler 139; see Sullivan 89). Therefore, Butler considers gender "as a corpo real style, an 'act,' as it were, which is both intentional and performative, where 'performative1 suggests a dramatic and contingent construction of meaning" (139; italics in original). As Sullivan argues in her discussion of the phenomenon of the gay male skinhead, it is difficult to decide whether a given performance can be "read as subversive" of the cultural codes it imitates/ paro dies, or whether it can be seen as "reinforcing particular hegemonic values and identities." The reasons for this ambiguity are that a particular performance has various effects on different audiences and that all performances are to</page><page sequence="4">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 487 some extent affected by the very power relations and ideologies they seek to challenge (Sullivan 91; see also Butler 139).5 WTiile Butler is generally interested in deconstructing the seemingly natu ral gender structure in the context of compulsory heterosexuality and phal logocentric language, in order to allow for the recognition of a diverse range of alternative notions of sexuality, gender, and the body, her theoretical frame work can be usefully adapted for an analysis of the multiple ways in which contemporary fiction opens up representational spaces for the construction of queer lifestyles in Berlin7s cultural topography. Specifically, it is the triple dialectic of performativity/performance, construction/authenticity, and affirmation/subversion that the gay-themed Berlin novels discussed below re negotiate and interrogate. The particular lifestyles enacted by their protago nists function as intentional performances of self-stylization that are self inventive without being totally autonomous, since they emerge vicariously through the reiterative participation in significations, practices, and ideolo gies that exist prior to the characters7 subjectivities and choices, even as they are reconfigured by them for individual purposes. This cultural reservoir ranges from the myth of the Weimar Republics liberal modernity to post reunification late capitalist consumer culture, eras singled out for their capac ity to promote gay sexualized city space. Berlin7s (and other cities7) literary legacy, trendy image productions, media-hype, and mythic allure set up a phantasmagoric and spectacular stage, which accounts for the reappearance of Butler's notion of denaturalized, "artificial" gender construction in the highly mediated, "artificial" performances of queer Berlin lives. Owing to cumulative effects of metropolitan discourses, most protagonists willfully or passively "buy" into capitalism's commodifying hegemony. Yet some charac ters try to distance themselves critically from the dominant social order even while remaining partially involved in it. Frequently, this kind of subversive resistance employs (or at least implies) the very language of authenticity? gendered or otherwise?that queer theory's notion of performativity seeks to disavow. Thus, these novels provide specific literary instantiations of some important tenets of queer theory while questioning their overall applicability; the possibilities and limits of queer theory are thus "tested," as it were, within the specific aesthetic, historical, and political parameters of Berlin's queer space. I adopt the term "queer space" from Dianne Chisholm, who deploys Wal ter Benjamin's writings on modern capitalist city space for her suggestive reading of contemporary literary representations of queer urbanity. Chisholm argues that "queer space" designates the productive and performative appro priation of the metropolis for "bodily, especially sexual, pleasure"; it employs practices like cruising and parading in order to create "heterotopias" that open up alternatives to mainstream culture even if their subversive potential "is limited by the power grid and total domination by capitalist market forces."</page><page sequence="5">488 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 As Chisholm explains, "queer constellations" are dialectical images con structed through Benjamin's devices of literary montage, fl?nerie, topographi cal memory, and other strategies, which reveal that the city of late capitalism is marked by "enhanced consumer seduction, where commodity spectacle and advertising technology saturate and dominate space." Here, she proposes, "the city itself is a commodity fetish-on-display, exhibiting and marketing its 'historic' sectors, and selling (selling-out) its 'alternative' neighborhoods and 'bohemian' lifestyles (10-11). Gay-themed Berlin novels, as I will show, utilize devices such as montage technique, inner monologue, and narrative (or quasi-cinematic) forms of fl?nerie in order to inscribe queer desires and lifestyles into the political transi tion culture of the old/new German capital. The novels portray Berlin as a Benjaminian surface spectacle of metropolitan myths, consumer capitalism, and media culture, where gay desires are transformed into cultural commodi ties for a wide variety of lifestyle performances. These manifestations of queerness include the cultivation of nostalgic dreams, fashionable trends, pro miscuous pursuits of fleeting delights, and tenuous hopes for meaningful rela tionships. In Kr?hnke's, and, to a lesser degree, in Rehberg's novel, Chisholm's term "queer constellation" captures the protagonists' evocation of significant fragments of the urban past as contrastive foils for their own queer fl?nerie. In Schacht's work, by contrast, the scarcity of detailed historical referents is in dicative of what he portrays as the relentless flatness and evanescence of the contemporary Berlin scene. In a way, then, Schacht's novel offers a limited constellation where the past is almost completely absorbed into the homoge nizing (dehistoricizing) present. II Born in 1956 in Darmstadt, Friedrich Kr?hnke is the author of twelve books; his most recent work, Samoa, oder Ein Mann von f?nfzig]ahren, was pub lished in 2006. His short novel Grundeis, written and set in the spring of 1989, is a retelling of Erich K?stner 's classic children's book Emil und die Detektive (1929) from the perspective of its eponymous villain. Kr?hnke's narrative is an example of postmodern pastiche, a nostalgic tribute to and ironic reversal of the original. Employing a fast-moving mix of police interviews, interior monologue, point-of-view narration, and diary entries, Grundeis restores the visibility of (homo-)erotic desire in the act o? fl?nerie,6 an aspect that was only sparingly and evasively alluded to in the works of such modernist writers as Walter Benjamin, Franz Hessel, Joris Karl Huysmans, and Christopher Isher wood. In K?stner 's original, the man named Grundeis is a petty thief stealing money from an innocent youth arriving in Berlin from the provinces, who is assisted in his attempt to seek justice by a local gang of street-smart boys.</page><page sequence="6">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 489 Kr?hnke's novel reinserts this plot into the situation of divided Berlin just before the fall of the Wall. His Grundeis, fixating on his prey less for financial than for sexual reasons, is a sophisticatedjugendbuchautor from East Berlin, en dowed with an exit visa to the West. Driven by his desire for metropolitan street life and his lust for young boys, he shuttles back and forth between the St?s/-ridden, petty-bourgeois dreariness of the GDR capital and West Berlin's rampant consumerism, with its department stores, sex shops, enticing night life, broad streets, and efficient subway trains. Although he commodifies p?d?rastie sexuality by "consuming" boys like objects circulating in the capi talist economy, Grundeis is at the same time fascinated and repelled by West Berlin's commodity fetishism; exemplifying this contradiction, he praises the over-supply of fashion, antiquities, and luxury specialty stores around Kurf?rstendamm, but he also draws attention to the signs of heroin addic tion, AIDS, suicides, and rampant crime (105-07). Kr?hnke's narrative suggests a significant shift in the perception of gay themes, which queer theory must acknowledge if it wants to keep up with the current emphasis in cultural studies on the semiotics of postmodern urban culture. As the character of Grundeis suggests, queer identity is not a socially stable category but the effect of highly complex acts of willful yet destabili zing self-construction in the context of divergent cultural environments. The literary construction of Berlin's queer space does not necessarily contribute to gay identity politics or social emancipation. Rather, the city's topography opens up a self-reflexive, even playful engagement with those aspects of a highly mediated culture that enable or limit the formation of queer desire and lifestyles in the first place. Thus, Grundeis's sexual exploits appear less as a hapless individual's unchecked passions than as provocatively perverse acts of self-invention, as the construction of a lifestyle whose motivations arise from the character's thoroughly self-conscious adaptation?queering?of the myth of Weimar Germany's capital and its cultural liberalism, moral "deca dence," and cosmopolitan diversity For what Grundeis really longs for is neither West nor East Berlin, but the city's mythic and undivided past; he loves to pursue bookish fantasies about the lost cultural vitality of Weimar Berlin, which for him is the only metropo lis whose allure could possibly match the cosmopolitan attractions of Paris and other international centers of modern life. Grundeis perceives himself as a latter-day fl?neur, as a successor to the great city writers of the 1920s and 730s: "K?stner schrieb auf dem Kurf?rstendamm in Caf?s. Das interessierte mich. - Ich wollte auch so leben. Ich will es noch jetzt [...]. Ich lebte ganz in dem Berlin dieser B?cher. War ich nicht selbst einer wie dieser Kisch?" (34)?refer ring to the "rasende Reporter" Egon Erwin Kisch. Meeting Erik Tischbein (Kr?hnke's reincarnation of K?stner's Emil) while on a train ride to Berlin, he advises the youth: "Geh einfach flanieren, wenns deine Verwandten erlauben, immer der Nase nach" (22). Grundeis's Berlin is a fantastically exaggerated</page><page sequence="7">490 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 metropolis, replete with all sorts of "Monstrosit?ten77: "Die einen Lokale sind f?r alte Damen, die anderen f?r?nicht rot werden!?schwule M?nner, und wieder andere f?r alte Damen, die in Wirklichkeit schwule M?nner sind77 (23). Spending a night in the Pension Eisenach, where he habitually takes his young boys, Grundeis dreams that he is a fl?neur back in pre-World War II Berlin and feels as if he were in a film. Indeed, his phantasmagoric city vision resembles scenes from Walter Ruttmann7s classic documentary montage film Berlin: Symphonie der Gro?stadt (1927): cars, trams, vulgar working-class men, whores, beggars, and attractive young guys hanging out at the train station. But instead of taking a rest at one of the fabled caf?s on Unter den Linden, Grundeis is suddenly driven by an irrational fear into the Linden Passage, the famous shopping arcade off Friedrichstra?e. As portrayed in John Henry Mackay7s novel Der Puppenjunge (1926), this arcade, demolished after World War II, was not just a symbol of Berlin7s Gr?nderzeit prosperity and 1920s com mercial boom, but also a notorious meeting point for hustlers. Even though Kr?hnke does not explicitly mention this precursor text, the Passaged ambiva lent atmosphere resurfaces in the novel, as Grundeis rushes madly through the establishment, trying in vain to escape his frightful vision of ghosts and skeletons, which he believes can only be dispelled by his attraction to boys (85-88). He also watches Fritz Lang's M-Eine Stadt sucht einen M?rder (1931), because he is attracted to the film's evocative theme of anonymity, which, according to the pioneer of (homo-)sexual studies Magnus Hirschfeld, was conducive to homosexuals at the time. Grundeis identifies with the aura of suspicion surrounding the film7s paranoid protagonist, who tries in vain to escape from himself and the specters of his innocent victims (108-10). Thus, Grundeis enacts some of the typical characteristics of ChisholnVs definition of queer fl?nerie, which shares with its classic precursor practice the leisurely pace and the desire stimulated by the city. Yet whereas the traditional fl?neur practices dispassionate detachment and an objectless desire, the queer cruiser "loses composure (or decomposes) with exposure to the city7s erotic specta cles" (Chisholm 46). Interestingly, this kind of decomposition reinserts a mo ment of authenticity into Grundeis7s self-conscious cultivation of nostalgic fl?nerie because it is the attempt to run away from his "st?ndige Todesangst" that truly motivates his activities; his seemingly indifferent and sovereign explorations of metropolitan street life essentially highlight how "bitter ernst" he takes his "Konstrukt vom Wunsch zu flanieren" (45). This is one of a series of significant moments typical of gay-themed Berlin novels, where the discourse of authenticity, albeit temporarily and incom pletely, disrupts the performative practices of queer lifestyles, partially sub verting their artificiality, self-absorption, and consumerist phantasms. Recog nizing that his p?d?rastie cruising will never be able to liberate him from his existential fear of death, Grundeis sublimates this "authentic77 personal prob lem by deliberately displacing it onto the larger political issue of Berlin7s reuni</page><page sequence="8">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 491 fication. As it turns out, Grundeis has staged the entire plot of the novel as a scheme to promote the fall of the Wall: "Wenn ich nicht genug Caf?s und Reklameschilder bekomme, dann mu? ich dorthin, wo ich genug davon finde. Wenn ich beim Umherstreifen auf eine Mauer sto?e und ich kann nicht weiter, dann mu? die Mauer weg" (56). What facilitates Grundeis's plan is the unlikely cooperation between Erik and the gang of street urchins, whose own performance must collaborate with the very evil it seeks to eradicate because one of the gang members, the Turkish boy Ozg?r, is designated by his friends to prostitute himself to Grundeis as part of the group's endeavor to bring the villain to justice: "Ganz klar," says the Polish boy Andrzej about ?zg?r, "Einem Engel kann keiner widerstehen, und der [Grundeis] schon gar nicht," whereupon the Turkish boy flashes his white teeth and?"braunhaarig, knopf?ugig" and "wundersch?n"?goes on his mission, whistling ironically (67-68). Here, the novel enacts a scenario where ethnic difference from the German/white majority is fantasized as a subject position that projects youth, beauty, and goodness as redemptive qualities in the fight against sex ual aggression marked by white adult maleness/This multicultural solidarity finds its own way of dealing with Berlin's East-West dualism because it comes to the rescue of the West German Erik?"Ein Wessi" says Andrzej (46)? against the Ossi Grundeis. Ultimately, however, the reader realizes that the boy's initiatives are only elements in the grander scenario serving Grundeis's vision of Berlin's reunifi cation. Having noticed that Erik's friends are closing in on him during one of his stays in West Berlin, the villain barely makes it to the Eastern part at Bahnhof Friedrichstra?e, only to return all of a sudden and let himself be caught by the police who have been alerted by the watchful boys. As they rush in great numbers to Erik's help from all over the city, Grundeis's vision of a reunified Berlin seems to turn into reality: [N]un h?rt man Sprechch?re drau?en, "Grund-eis, Grund-eis" und, wie es wohl in einem solchen Moment nicht anders sein kann, erst zaghaft und vereinzelt, dann lauter und h?ufiger dazwischen: "Die Mauer mu? weg! Die Mauer mu? weg! Die Mauer mu? weg!" (118) Thus, the sexually transgressive act of Grundeis's p?d?rastie fl?nerie, although unable to resolve its "authentic" problem (i.e., his personal fear of death), leads to the political utopia of a transgressive border between East and West Berlin, which was to turn into sudden and surprising reality soon after the novel was completed. As Kr?hnke remarks in an ironic postscript: "Diese Erz?hlung ist im Fr?hjahr 1989 geschrieben worden. Seitdem haben sich Dinge vollzogen, mit denen in dieser Tragweite nicht einmal Grundeis gerechnet hat" (125).</page><page sequence="9">492 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 III Whereas Kr?hnke7s novel links queer self-invention in the shadow of the Berlin Wall with the city7s literary heritage, writings after German reunifica tion depict such lifestyles as governed by the electronic media and consumer technologies in the age of global capitalism. A free-lance writer, Martin Schacht (born in 1965) has been active as gossip columnist, TV astrologer, and ghostwriter. His most recent publication is Die ewige Zielgruppe (2004), a pop portrait of the baby boomer generation in consumer society. Set in Berlin Mitte, Schacht7 s first novel Mittendrin portrays the reconstructed new city center as the crazy playground of contemporary media hype, the fashion in dustry, rampant consumerism, trendy art scenes, and endless partying. The fleeting nature of these alluring aspects of Germany 7s post-reunification capi tal is appropriately captured in brief, succinct chapters, which form a rapidly moving, montage-like kaleidoscope of colorful images, people, and scenes. After completing his Zivildienst on an exchange program in Australia and then hanging out on a Thai island, the protagonist Felix?who is basically straight but not against engaging in some rather j uvenile gay games to acquire a highly desirable pair of snake-leather pants (46-49)?arrives in the new capital in search of a new and exciting life. He perceives the city as a quasi-filmic mon tage of stereotypical landmarks, which create a hallucinatory d?j?-vu effect of prefabricated images from popular media: uStra?e des 17Juni steht auf einem Stra?enschild, als er in Richtung S-Bahn schlendert, und der Name Tiergarten verschafft ihm schlie?lich ein Aha-Erlebnis. Er kennt diese Ecke aus dem Fernsehen, aus Berichten ?ber die Loveparade. " Or: "Zwar hat er die Kr?ne und Baugruben rund um den Reichstag oder das Kanzleramt oft genug auf Bildern gesehen, doch in natura ist ihre schiere Gr??e erschlagend77 (10-11). Post reunification Berlin appears as simulacrum, a phantasmagoric spectacle of depthless presence, in which a few references to the past, like the GDR Fernsehturm, are only noted in passing (11). Among the gay personnel of the novel we encounter Roy Best, the flam boyant designer of the perfume Dream Come True. Popular through illus trated newspapers and talk shows, Best is an iconic product of mass media technology; off-screen he turns out to be little more than a silly caricature of contemporary homosexual stereotypes: Ohne die Filter der Mattscheibe oder der Fotografie ist Roy Best vor allem ein bisschen zu viel: eine Idee zu blond, das L?cheln einen Tick zu k?nstlich und der K?rper etwas zu trainiert f?r einen Mittf?nfziger. Das Ergebnis ist so bunt, als h?tte man den Fernseher falsch eingestellt, gleichzeitig aber irgendwie beeindru ckend. (44) Famous, rich, and witty, Best can talk about virtually anything, from nanotechnology to the legacy of the Nazi regime, proclaiming that today, money can best be made not by designing fashion but by dealing in "Lizenzen,</page><page sequence="10">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 493 Kissen, Handt?cher, Gartenm?bel, Geschirr, Nudeln" (45). Then there is Marc, a "Modepapst in spe," whose outfit is "die perfekte Mischung aus Wahnsinn und Couture," and who is totally enamored by his own "Fernseh pr?senz" (29-32). We meet this "blondierten Mode-Punk" again when he is picking up the party supply service employee Daniel. Living "in einer schmud deligen Bruchbude mit Treppenhaus ohne Beleuchtung in Friedrichshain," Marc exhibits a sexual behavior that is typical of Berlin Mitte's simulations and image fetishism: "Schon spreizt Marc seine Schenkel, und alles wirkt irgendwie falsch. Er agiert, wie er es wohl aus Pornofilmen gelernt hat, was Daniel endg?ltig abturnt" (50-51). The next day, Daniel's partner Alexander, who in vain insists on a faithful relationship, must get up alone, looking at nothing but his own image in the mirror, which seems to highlight only his rather trivial fashion dependency: "Er grinst sein Spiegelbild an. Schwarzer, enger Kaschmirsweater von Jil Sander, ergonomische Jeans, Oldschool Trainer von Adidas?schlicht und cool: Hallihatlo, ich bin's, der Mann, der den Spa? und die Schnittchen mitbringt11 (54; italics in original). Schacht's depictions include references to homophobic stereotypes about queer lifestyle promoted by heterosexist ideologies: "Das Ger?cht, dass schwule Singles st?ndig, dauernd und ?berall tollen Sex haben, ist offenbar in die Welt gesetzt worden, um die Heteros zu demoralisieren" (176). Yet imme diately after this utterance Daniel reconfirms the promiscuity that he just declared a homophobic stereotype by going to a porn movie theatre where he meets a young student "mit dem er schon bei mehreren Gelegenheiten unverbindlichen Sex hatte" (176). The comic effect of Schacht's novel derives largely from such disclosures of the narcissistic motivations of second-hand, highly mediated lifestyles. The characters of Mittendrin, whether gays or straight metrosexuals, indulge in lifestyle performances that seem to be autonomous acts of self-invention but turn out to have internalized the worst homosexual clich?s produced or rein forced by the popular media industry?urban gays as self-indulgent, smart, trendy, consumerist, promiscuous, and superficial sophisticates. Schacht ex poses these denizens of Berlin Mitte as gleeful collaborators and self-pitying victims of late capitalist consumer society in the age of global financial ex change and image replication, a world in which the recycling of media mes sages, fashion industry products, and other trendy things almost totally commodity their own users. Here, gender performances generally serve to solidify the existing ideology without envisioning any kind of lasting subver sion or critique through the assertion of authenticity or subj ective autonomy. Sporadically, some characters do explore such possibly alternative subject positions, but only to reject them in the end. After landing a role in a popular TV soap opera, Felix muses about his "Au?enwirkung" and the perception of his clothing style by other people: "Das Komische ist, dass ihm fast alles steht, aber egal, was er anzieht, er sieht zu echt aus" (190). Here, Felix invokes the</page><page sequence="11">494 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Fall 2006 category of authenticity only to disavow its potentially subversive power: in stead of undermining the hegemony of arbitrarily changing fashion trends, the criterion of "echt77 is reduced to a mere effect or simulacrum of the very consumer fetishism it otherwise could have served to dislodge. As a result, Fe lix must realize that his opportunistic self-styling according to the standards of others has undermined any true sense of identity as people begin to equate him with the character he plays on television: " [M] anchmal hat er das Gef?hl, als Felix gar nicht mehr richtig zu existieren" (190-91). Schacht7s sequel Stra?en der Sehnsucht shows that the overhyped capitals economic downturn threatens to destroy its (gay or straight) denizens7 eu phoric pursuit of phantasmagoric lifestyles: "Hier macht eine Fernsehpro duktion dicht, da wird ein Werbeetat gestrichen, dort ist eine New-Economy Klitsche zahlungsunf?hig. Und die Leute, die bei diesen Firmen bequeme, gut bezahlte Jobs hatten, fliehen in der Hoffnung, dass man dort auf sie wartet, zur?ck nach M?nchen, K?ln oder Hamburg77 (15-16). On the other hand, Felix7s old Kiez Kreuzberg is being thoroughly gentrified: it is now a district where Turkish families go about their daily business, where his favorite bakery still sells the best Mandelh?rnchen, but where an old factory building is being remodeled into an Islamic culture center (51). In this climate of multicultural consolidation, it seems that "Die nuller Jahre werden als die Zeit der Lifestyle Apokalypse in die Geschichte eingehen" (103; italics in original). But the eco nomic and political changes in the new capital have no lasting effect on the characters7 pursuit of trendy consumerism, public media events, and drug induced escapism. Like Felix, Vera Magun, an actress long past her glorious prime, epitomizes the almost total hegemony of capitalist commodification, which again evokes the potentially subversive category of authenticity only to displace and co-opt it for its own purposes. It appears that Vera "in ihrem Roberto-Cavalli-Neo-Hippie-Look ein bisschen zu authentisch r?berkommt, sie wirkt wie eine nette, etwas aufgedonnerte Hippie-Mutti, und das will sie bestimmt nicht" (114). Here again, authenticity is invoked not as an alterna tive to consumer capitalism and its fashion industry but as an objectionable surplus: With Felix and Vera, "too much77 authenticity appears totally inau thentic, revealing itself as something that they invoke against their own in tentions of being artificial; thus "authenticity77 poses no danger whatsoever to the phantasmagorias of metropolitan culture but merely reconfirms their ubiquity. Vera7s brush with an authenticity which she cannot really embody is related to her former fame as a practitioner of camp: during the 1970s, as a re sult of the disco wave, the French and Italians adored her as a "Dance-Diva,77 while students of film and homosexuals began to appreciate "den ausge pr?gten Camp-Charakter ihres fr?hen filmischen uvres77 (122-23). Accord ing to Susan Sontag7s classic definition, "the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration" (275). Questioning traditional gender</page><page sequence="12">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 495 roles through the celebration of the androgynous (Sontag 279) as well as high culture's moral seriousness and the avant-garde exploration of "extreme states of feeling," camp is the "consistently aesthetic experience of the world" (287), which provides theatricalized opportunities for "Dandyism in the age of mass culture" (289). As such, camp appeals especially to homosexuals be cause it "neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness" while appeal ing to "the homosexual's desire to remain youthful" (290-91). Inasmuch as Vera sports a surplus of "authentic" looks, albeit involuntarily, she has be trayed her former camp fame, since camp of course seeks to transcend the tra ditional dichotomy of artifice vs. authenticity altogether. Certainly, many of Schacht's characters want to adhere to campy lifestyles as dandies of post-industrial consumer capitalism and its mass-cultural icons, but they fail to live up to this sensibility because their extravagance is too deliberate, incon sistent, and dispassionate to be true camp; therefore, what we get from them is what Sontag would call "pseudo-Camp?what is merely decorative, safe, in a word, chic" (284). Thus, whereas Schacht's characters themselves cannot break out of their affiliations with the dominant order, even while dreaming of a more fulfilling and less alienated existence, the novels themselves reveal their critical potential through their satirical and ironic exposure of the very contradictions, illusions, and blind spots that the characters are only dimly aware of. Still, one cannot help notice that Schacht's narratives, obsessively amassing minute details that test even the most attentive reader's patience, obviously delight in the very lifestyles whose vanity and evanescence he ex poses to ridicule. Thus, the overall effect of his novels is an ideological meta ambiguity hovering between affirmation and subversion, which replicates the ambiguity typical of the fictional characters themselves. IV In Kr?hnke's and Schacht's novels, Berlin appears sexually charged as the illusory and elusive site for the performance of homosexual lifestyles; identi fying his cruising of young boys metonymically with his pursuit of the metropolis, Grundeis declares: "Die Stadt jagen, indem man die Knaben jagt! Die Knaben, indem man sich der Stadt ausliefert. Das ist grandios gelungen, sobald ich schlie?lich die Stadt als Knabenmasse mich jagen lasse" (122). Even more explicitly, in Peter Rehberg's Fag Love, the German capital is thoroughly sexualized, turning into a myth of queer promiscuity, hopes, and despair, a site whose identity arises from the interaction of past and present as well as from the city's difference from other gay metropolitan centers (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles). Born in 1966 in Hamburg, Rehberg lived in New York and Chicago for ten years and taught German literature and queer studies in Bonn. Stylistically, his novel is perhaps the most experimental example of recent</page><page sequence="13">496 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 queer Berlin fiction, consisting of a montage of elliptical reflections, fragmen tary dialogues, and sketchy observations that more poignantly than the other novels articulate the lifestyle mobility but also the existential disorientation of queer experience in the postmodern metropolis. After his return from a three-year stay in New York, the protagonist Felix finds himself abandoned by his partner Anton; at that point, Felix wants to design a new plan for a new life by getting to know the "schwule Berlin." He muses about having picked up the American Kevin two nights before in the basement of the gay Gate Sauna around the corner from the Brandenburg Gate. The establishment is housed "in einem dieser allerh?sslichsten Acht ziger-Jahre-DDR-H?user" that have miraculously survived the capital's ubiquitous rebuilding frenzy, while this area between Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz, right above the former Hitler bunker, has now become "mit Sicherheit tint prime location" (53). Later, still mad over Anton's loss, he races out of his Neuk?lln apartment, feeling that in Berlin, "Die H?user waren dieselben, gleichg?ltig bewegten sie sich nicht und ?berlebten alle Geschich ten," although the city now looks different: "Zerhackte Balkone flogen links und rechts vorbei. Blick, blitzig" (60-61). Like Kr?hnke's Grundeis, Felix tries to inscribe the tribulations of modern gay life into the ruins and fragments of metropolitan history, even if his image of Berlin and other cities seems flat tened by his obsessively sexualized gaze, which commodifies gay sexuality according to the capitalist ideology of freely available object choices: "Der Mythos Berlin lebte davon, dass man ?berall immerzu billigen Sex haben konnte. [...] In New York war es genau umgekehrt. Der Mythos New York lebte davon, dass Sex zwar ?berall versprochen, dann aber verboten war " (66). In Chicago7s Boystown district, public rainbow color icons everywhere signal the co-optation of gay activity by business enterprises and the real estate mar ket (83). Similarly, in corporate and tourist-friendly New York, sexual promis cuity has been sanitized by the recent media industry, commercialization, and tourist industry: "Gentrification = Disneyfication, wie man am Times Square deutlich sehen konnte [...]. Wo Schwule nur noch als Musicalschwule toleriert wurden" (83-84).8 Off Times Square, however, the streets of New York still exert sexual attraction. The classical theorists of urban fl?nerie had always allusively des cribed the act of enjoying the urban spectacle in quasi-erotic, even voyeuristic language, while usually excluding cruising and other explicitly sexual pursuits. In Rehberg's novel, even more than in the other narratives discussed here, this (homo-)erotic subtext surfaces directly in the dynamic city streets, turning them into an anthropomorphic target of queer desire; this attractive ness is, like in Kr?hnke's and Schacht's novels, highly mediated, as Rehberg's characters live their homosexual lives vicariously through the identification with discourses of popular music, films, and television shows. As the protago nist Felix stresses: "Man konnte in New York zwar superschwul sein, eine</page><page sequence="14">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 497 Beziehung konnte man dort aber nicht haben. Man hatte ja schon eine Bezie hung mit New York. Hatte ich irgendwann von den M?dels aus Sex and the City gelernt" (35). Felix even reads his relationship with Anton as if it were a queer parody of a mainstream Hollywood movie: Vor drei Jahren, als wir uns kennen gelernt hatten, dachte ich, jetzt wird mein Leben wie ein Film. Ein Film, f?r den die Pet Shop Boys die Musik geschrieben hatten. Anton und ich: ein Leben wie in einem schwulen James-Bond-Film, mit Pet-Shop-Boys-Soundtrack dazu. (42-43) Not surprisingly, the quasi-cinematic language of fl?nerie seems to fit seamlessly into this kind of self-fashioning. Even more radically than Kr?hn ke's Grundeis, Felix re-employs the traditional flaneur's vocabulary of visual desire in order to consume the city as a site where the feeling of belonging to the crowds and the willingness to take sexual risks seem at least as erotic as the physical act itself: "Promiskuit?t fand in New York am hellichten Tag, auf der Stra?e, statt [...]. Die Stra?en von New York waren sexy. Egal, ob man jetzt wirklich Sex hatte oder nicht" (68). By contrast, Berlin's sexualization begins only after sunset: In Berlin musste man warten, bis es dunkel wurde. Dann erst wurde die Stadt sch?n. Berlin bei Nacht. In Berlin nachts so leben wie sonst nur in New York. Mit Berlin eine Beziehung haben, wie es sonst nur mit New York geht. Eine Bezie hung mit einer Stadt, nicht mit einem Mann. Sch?ne schwule St?dte f?r Sex, nicht f?r Liebe. (68) As a result of this shift of sexual attraction from person to city, Felix believes that Anton deserted him not only because he no longer found his partner at tractive but because Felix over-extended his own erotic relationship with New York: "Weil ich drei Jahre lang lieber eine Beziehung mit New York hatte als mit Anton. Weil ich ihn drei Jahre lang mit New York betrogen hatte" (80; italics in original). Not surprisingly, Felix's displacement of his personal responsibility to that of sexualized city aesthetics is deceptive; as his friend Lisa reminds him, Anton probably did not leave Felix because of his lover's preference for New York but: "Weil er gemerkt hat, dass er auch ohne dich in Berlin gl?cklich sein konnte" (96-97). It is only when Felix must struggle with genuine fears about pain and mortality upon discovering his new American partner's HIV-positive status that he regrets his "falsche[s] Leben" (152) and confesses: "Ich wollte mit Jack zusammen sein, egal wo. In welcher Stadt man lebte, war in Wirklichkeit nicht so wichtig" (161). According to queer theory, such a position might be considered an illusory remnant of the post-Enlightenment notion of the autonomous self, leading to bourgeois notions of romantic love as redemptive union. In the context of this novel, however, Felix7s quest functions as a re-assertion of a type of love that questions the fetishization of city space because it is not displaced to the sexu</page><page sequence="15">498 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 alized body of the city but focuses on the (other) person as an individual. This type of love seems preferable to the overly theatrical and self-indulgent per versity of the leather cult performed by Felix's Chicago acquaintance Man fred, whose silly provocations seem simply out of synch with his middle age and have lost their critical potential for sexual liberation and anti-bourgeois shock: "Ich hatte mir abgew?hnt das Wort subversiv zu benutzen" (141; italics in original), Felix dryly comments. Similarly, his assertion: "Mein schwules Leben soll wie ein Film aussehen, hatte ich auch gedacht, als ich nach New York kam. Wir wollten aber ein schwules Leben im wirklichen Leben. Wir wollten wirklich schwul werden" (174), expresses a desire for authenticity outside the cinematic depiction of sentimental gay romance, exemplified by a film about a promiscuous Ledermann who rekindles his love for a young gay poet when he listens to his friend7s cheesy lyrics (175-76). Rejecting this stereotypical film for its lack of similarity with the dreariness of a real leather bar frequented by HIV-positive men and other customers who look like porn stars (176), Felix, on tour with Jack through California, looks for a "real77 gay life based on genuine emotional communication, loyalty, and unmediated simplicity, including even plans for a gay wedding (186). Ironically, however, this vision of "authentic" love depends itself on other representations of popu lar culture, for Felix and Jack discover that their new favorite song is "Run ning" by No Doubt, which includes a reference to the values of romantic com mitment ("Be the one I need/ Be the one I trust most/ Don7t stop inspiring me") they try to cultivate in their own relationship (181). As an effect of cul tural media, rather than as something that exists outside it, the assertion of authenticity attached to the ideal of romantic love thus unsettles and chal lenges the hegemonic order of capitalist entertainment culture and sexual consumer ideology without transcending it; while absolutely "real" from the point of view of the protagonists and thus powerful in its own right, it re mains partial, incomplete, and possibly unrealizable in the long run (because of Jack7s HIV-positive status, his and Felix7s future together remains uncer tain). Partial opposition to the sexualized city space also comes from Felix7s best friend Sven, for whom Felix7s relationship with Jack is the first of his friend7s affairs of which he wholeheartedly approves: "Good catch" (145). Although gay and finally experiencing what his friends call his coming-out as a "Leder schwuler77 (138), Sven defies the consumerist equation of homosexual pro miscuity and postmodern urban lifestyle by preferring friendship to sex and apparently living without a boyfriend or one-night stands. Although clearly fascinated by the bizarre sexual antics of the leather fetishist Manfred, Sven enjoys his performances as an intriguing spectacle without wanting to partic ipate in them, beyond simply trying on Manfred7s outfits (140-44). For Sven, the homoerotic orientation mostly provides an ironic philosophy and a detached perspective on life, not necessarily the motivation for sexual prac</page><page sequence="16">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 499 tices; thus, he prefers to delight his surroundings with aphorisms like this one: "Wenn Liebe bedeutet, vom anderen verstanden zu werden, und genau das, ganz grunds?tzlich, gar nicht geht, dient der Zustand des Verliebtseins dazu, dar?ber hinwegzut?uschen" (40). Writing his own annotations to Felix7s pop music play lists, "[s]ortiert nach den Stationen einer schwulen Liebes geschichte," Sven points out that the stories of Felix and his friends are noth ing but footnotes to popular culture: "Weil ihre Geschichten in Wirklichkeit schon zuvor von der Popmusik erz?hlt worden sind" (189). Turning himself into a meta-narrative commentator, Sven reveals both the ideology of homo sexual promiscuity and the quest for romantic love as effects of popular cul ture, as competing lifestyles similarly conditioned by postmodern media and the culture industry. V The Berlin novels discussed here suggest that contemporary queer culture vacillates ambivalently between subversion of and collaboration with late capitalist commodity society. The exact terms of this relationship between queerness and capitalism are highly contested in current theories (see Jagose 109 and 115). In a polemical footnote to the introduction to his essay collec tion Fear of A Queer Planet, Michael Warner asserts that one of the obstacles against Marxist sexual politics "is the close connection between consumer society culture and the most visible spaces of gay culture: bars, discos, adver tising, fashion, brand-name identification, mass-cultural camp, 'promiscu ity7" (xxxi). Warner identifies these spaces (which, one can add, characterize the postmodern metropolis in general and, in a particularly hyperbolic form, the literary representations of post-reunification Berlin), as the "most visible mode" in which gay culture is typical of "precisely those features of advanced capitalism that many on the left are most eager to disavow." As he memorably concludes, "Post-Stonewall urban gay men reek of the commodity." Hence, he argues, queer theory must develop a "more dialectical view of capitalism than many people have imagination for" (xxxi). Jeff Maskovsky has criticized Warner7s conflation of modern gay culture with advanced capitalist con sumer culture for neglecting the differentiating categories of race and ethnic ity. As Maskovsky shows, gay working-class people of color are usually not members of the (white, middle-class) stratum of consumers but belong in stead to the work force that sustains bars, discos and other such places as sites of gay conspicuous consumption in the first place (267-70). Kr?hnke7s novel for instance mentions the presence of Vietnamese, Polish, and Turkish immi grants as members of a working class that defies the white bourgeois con sumer capitalism of Berlin (23; 96,105). Rather at odds with queer theory7s pluralistic notions of non-heteronormative sexualities, Warner here seems to</page><page sequence="17">500 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 lapse into notions of a seemingly homogeneous gay culture, an assumption that Maskovsky deconstructs as being symptomatic of neoliberal ideology it self (269). Indeed, the relation of (some versions of) gay identity or queer lifestyles and late consumer capitalism is a complex and controversial issue. In his cri tique of recent normalizing and conservative trends in German gay politics, Eike Stedefeldt proposes that in the current era of mass unemployment, the dramatic decrease in social benefit programs, and the devaluation of human relations, gay men have emerged as prototypes of a new capitalist entrepre neur and consumer society; they have largely abandoned the legacy of the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 770s, which was born out of the social ist-inspired protests against petit-bourgeois complacency, militarism, and the capitalist authority state. While at that time, gay emancipation was under stood as a subversive interrogation of any kind of traditional power structures and heterosexual morality codes, gay bourgeois emancipation now simply means advocating the right to copy these heterosexual norms and to assimi late to the dominant social conditions. Thorough critiques of capitalism and the patriarchal order seem to have disappeared entirely from today 7s gay life style culture (Stedefeldt 204-10). Similarly, Elmar Kraushaar argues that for homosexuals today, no real social and political change has occurred, only an image correction: instead of criminalizing gay lifestyles, mainstream society treats them as an optimal test market for new commodities and new con sumer attitudes. For this image change, Kraushaar blames certain types of homosexual opportunists themselves, who misuse their traditional mimicry ability to gain social recognition by opportunistically mixing self-pitying awareness of (historical) discrimination with a dash of gay self-pride, without violating the norms and boundaries set up by the heteronormal majority. Grateful for any kind of half-hearted civil rights concessions, their self-denials promote continued self-hatred and lack of tolerance among homosexuals themselves ("Vorwort"). In these accounts, which confirm many specifics of the fictional lifestyle performances especially in Schacht7s and Rehberg7s novels, the alliance of homosexuality and contemporary consumer society seems regrettable but inevitable. However, in a position paper submitted to etuxx, a queer internet discussion forum, Volker Woltersdorff, a.k.a. Lore Logorrh?e, has argued that the stereotypical image of contemporary gay lifestyle?mobile and flexible, hedonistic and consumerist, individualistic and stylistically sophisticated?is a politically motivated "phantasm" that prescribes the ways in which homo sexuality must present itself in order to be acceptable by mainstream (hetero normative) society. The impression that there is a "natural" connection between neoliberal capitalism and gay/lesbian emancipation, s/he continues, is an ideology that needs to be deconstructed in order to prevent the histori cally contingent affiliation of homosexual identities or subcultures with</page><page sequence="18">GOEBEL: Queer Berlin 501 neoliberalism from being hypostatized as a necessary "Schicksalsgemein schaft." Queer politics seeks to intervene critically in this false equation, espe cially since neoliberalism is not always free from homophobia; therefore, s/he concludes, queer discourse must advocate the (utopian) solution of abolishing capitalism ("Gay Lifestyle").9 As this debate suggests, the question whether the relation between queer culture and neoliberal consumer capitalism is necessary or contingent, emancipatory or oppressive, cannot be decided definitively or even theoreti cally. This relation is never fixed but constitutes a highly contradictory, multi faceted and constantly shifting process of cultural negotiation, and the novels discussed here provide imaginary scenarios for enacting and exemplifying exactly this constitutive ambiguity. Thus, most of these novels' lifestyle per formances are clearly the products of a media-oriented lifestyle ideology driven by economic consumerism, sexual promiscuity, trendy aesthetics, and other such manifestations of a highly mobile, socially privileged status in an increasingly global environment of post-industrial capitalism and late post modernity But while the novels do suggest that such lifestyles thrive on, and actively promote, neoliberal capitalism and its culture industry, they also stress that this relation is by no means necessary and certainly not "natural." On the contrary, the novels show that neoliberal queer lifestyles are highly artificial spectacles of self-fashioning, constructed vicariously through the appropriation of prefabricated discourses, images, and codes. Precisely be cause of their highly constructed character, these lifestyle scenarios provoke significant alternatives ranging from the multiethnic moral solidarity of boys in Grundeis to the visions of romantic love, friendship, and intellectual reflec tion in Rehberg's novel. Questioning the dominant sexual ideologies and trendy materialism of capitalist consumer and media culture, some of these positions assert forms of "authenticity" against the prevailing order of cul tural performances, even while ultimately remaining inscribed into the very regimes they seek to subvert. At the beginning of Fag Love, the protagonist muses: "Sven sagte, es gibt zwei M?glichkeiten, im Leben gl?cklich zu werden: leben, so schnell wies geht, oder, solange man lebt, nicht leben, sondern ?ber das Leben nachdenken. Ich habe mich f?rs Erste entschieden, Sven f?rs Zweite" (9). Such dual per spectives of collaborative participation and critical observation permeate in a variety of ways the entire corpus of texts discussed here. In other words, each novel's position vis-?-vis the dominant ideology vacillates between the seem ingly oppositional terms of subversion and affirmation. None of these novels seeks to offer Utopian visions of abandoning the hegemony of late capitalist consumer politics over gay subjects (or any other people), but none of them is totally victimized by its power or agrees simply to reproduce its deceptively alluring surface signifiers. Rather, all novels work from within the established ideology that they destabilize, without purporting to transcend its para</page><page sequence="19">502 The German Quarterly Fall 2006 meters. Significantly, this internal narrative ambiguity is also replicated by the broad spectrum of publishing venues, which range from a major "gay" press (M?nnerschwarmSkript Verlag) to a large mainstream house (Ro wohlt), which suggests that gay-themed fiction as a genre by itself is neither subversive nor affirmative but has highly variable and largely unpredictable effects on a pluralistic mass market. These complexities of ideological subject positions, narrative strategies, and mechanisms of literary production and distribution strongly suggest that queer criticism needs to redefine or expand its methodologies if it wants to take account of dramatic changes in gay writing itself. Traditionally, queer theory had to spell out those cryptic representations of same-sex desire that the official literary canon tried to conceal or marginalize, even though this covering up implied the ultimate recognition of irrepressible voices of queer difference (see Lorey and Plews "Defying Sights"). Analyzing the strategies used by canonical texts, appealing to readers who knew how to decode queer meanings couched in seemingly heterosexual language conventions, is an im portant task of queer theory that works especially well for texts from early classicism to high modernism, written in a climate of social discrimination and very restricted opportunities for openly gay self-articulation.10 But things have changed, largely as a result of the relative progress of gay liberation, a lit erary canon more open to representations of alternative sexualities, and a more tolerant or even gay-friendly mainstream audience.11 Instead of immers ing themselves in the highly allusive metaphoricity of classical representa tions of homoerotic desire suppressed by bourgeois heteronormality, readers can now buy popular novels sold by mainstream commercial publishers that openly celebrate (or trash) the lives of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and trans gendered persons. Therefore, queer literary theory has to move from the decoding of hidden same-sex subtexts to the analysis of the multiple ways in which contemporary fiction openly foregrounds queer lifestyles as conform ist or subversive performances in the present world of multiculturalism, global affairs, and postindustrial consumer capitalism. Since the complexity of this situation requires the analytical tools provided by interdisciplinary cul tural studies, queer theory must expand and cultivate its affiliations with other disciplines, such as urban studies, film criticism, media theory, ethnic discourses, and global studies. In so doing, queer theory may perhaps over come its relatively marginal position in German studies even while preserving its radical politics or culturally subversive aesthetics.
