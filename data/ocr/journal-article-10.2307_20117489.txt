<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. VAN BRAKEL INTERDISCOURSE OR SUPERVENIENCE RELATIONS: THE PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE ABSTRACT. Amidst the progress being made in the various (sub-)disciplines of the behavioural and brain sciences a somewhat neglected subject is the problem of how every thing fits into one world and, derivatively, how the relation between different levels of discourse should be understood and to what extent different levels, domains, approach es, or disciplines are autonomous or dependent. In this paper I critically review the most recent proposals to specify the nature of interdiscourse relations, focusing on the concept of supervenience. Ideally supervenience is a relation between different discourses which has all the advantages of reduction, but without its disadvantages. I apply the more abstract considerations to two concrete cases: schizophrenia and colour. Usually an interlevel or interdiscourse relation is seen as asymmetrical: the overlaying discourse depends on the underlying discourse (and not vice versa), where the out- or un-spoken assumption is that the ultimate underlying discourse is physical. Instead I argue that scientific categories referred to in interdiscourse relations are, ultimately, dependent on common sense cate gories and common sense normative criteria. It is the manifest categories and common sense ideas about what is reasonable and what is right that determine the relevant cate gorisations at the deeper, underlying levels. I suggest that the implications of this are not merely methodological or epistemological. 1. INTERDISCOURSE RELATIONS In colloquial scientific discourse there is a large vocabulary used to refer to relations between different levels of analysis or discourse. I will refer to such relations as "interdiscourse relations". For a start, there is noth ing wrong in understanding the phrase as "interlevel relations", "linking propositions" or "bridge laws". Examples of different discourses (or levels or domains or disciplines or theories) are physical discourse, behavioural discourse, brain discourse, genetic discourse, cultural discourse, moral discourse, and so on. Tables I and II illustrate the use of interdiscourse ter minology by presenting quotations from a number of recent articles in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The italicised subheadings in Table II provide a further illustration of what I mean by different discourses. In Table I a number of quotations are given from the article of Gray et al. (1991) on schizophrenia. The expressions in bold type all refer to some sort of relation between different discourses.

This is certainly not our position ... the neural basis of schizophrenia is to be found in the dynamic interplay between temporal lobe structures and the basal ganglia. [68, 69] Whether the origin of the neuropathology of the schizophrenic brain lies in genetic factors ... [or something else], we would still need to seek a mechanistic account of the way the resulting faulty brain gives rise to faulty behaviour [61]. some words seem to refer to a relation of identity, for example "is", "is defined", and "equation", whereas others seem to refer to a causal relation, for example "results in", and "gives rise to". In a case of identity there is "really" one thing which comes under different descriptions; in a case of causation one event causes another event: one thing is connected by a causal chain or process to another thing.1 The second point to notice is that whether the intended relation is one of causation or of identity is ambiguous. For example, the first entry in Table I, "schizophrenia is a brain dysfunction" could be read as a (partial) definition of what schizophrenia is, but it could also be read as saying that schizophrenia is caused by a brain dysfunction. Even when examples of interdiscourse relations are discussed in detail, a certain vagueness may remain as to whether the relation is one of identity (or co-extension) or causality (or determination).

VAN BRAKEL Kincaid (1988) discussing Putnam's example of a peg failing to fit a hole says on the one hand: "For the specific peg and board in question, their rigidity and shape just is having molecules in a certain arrangement" (p. 260, emphasis added). On the other hand he says: "given the micro-state in question, the relevant macrostate results necessarily" (p. 261, emphasis added). The expression that perhaps most often exemplifies this ambiguity in referring to interdiscourse relations is "to underlie" and its cognates. The omnipresence of this "catch-word" is illustrated in Table II. It is often unclear whether saying that B underlies S means that B causes S, or that S is the same as B (but at a different level of description), or that S should be understood or explained in terms of B, or whether it is left completely vague or indeterminate what the relation is between the S- and jB-discourse.2 I suggest the vagueness exemplifies a kind of covering up in order to avoid properly addressing the question of interdiscourse relations. However, what seems common to all occurrences is that "to underlie" implies a form of hierarchy or asymmetry between the different discourses that are related. If B underlies 5, apparently it is not the case that S underlies B. This would suggest that it is always a matter of B causing S, not of S being identical with B (identity being a symmetrical relation). But how does causation work across discourses? I will come back to this point in a moment. Let me stress the point of the ambiguity by going over it once more. There are many different ways of saying that B underlies S. For example one might say about the relation between an S- and f?-discourse or domain that B fixes S; that S is brought about by or realised in B phenomena; that S properties are possessed in virtue of B properties; that S is grounded in B; that B underpins S; that S is determined by or dependent on B; that S boils down to or comes to nothing more than B; that B controls S; and even that the constitution of S is a function of the constitution ofB? In unreflexive scientific language use such expressions seem to make no clear distinction between things being identical; being somehow related; one thing constituting, causing, controlling, or determining the other; one thing making some sort of contribution to another; one thing being, ceteris paribus, statistically relevant for another; and so on. Once again words in the last sentence suffer from the same sort of ambiguities. One purpose of this paper is to discuss a currently popular group of philosophical theories that aim at specifying the nature of interdiscourse relations, viz. supervenience theories. Recent talk of supervenience follows from earlier discussions about reduction in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mind.4 However, in order to prevent premature commit</page><page sequence="7">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 259 ments to specialised discourse I will often substitute "to overlay" for "to supervene" and "to underlie" for "to subvene". The use of "to overlay" is not common, but its intended meaning can be easily grasped. By definition, B underlies S if and only if S overlays B\ examples of the intended use of "to overlay" are given in the subheadings, of Table II. Unless specified otherwise B underlying S does not exclude the possibility that S might underlie B. Often theories about interdiscourse relations will be rephrased as theories about the meaning of "to underlie" (and "to overlay"). That is to say, I will substitute "to underlie" for, say, "to determine" or "to subvene", and "to overlay" for "to depend on" or "to supervene on". Note that unless the meaning of these words is explained more carefully it doesn't really matter which expression we are using. My conclusion about the significance of supervenience theories to explain interdiscourse relations will be negative and the second purpose of my paper is to suggest an alternative approach which tries to break through the intuitive appeal of the hierarchy implicit in words like "to underlie". So, the purpose of this article is to evaluate what the best current theories of interdiscourse relations are, viz. supervenience theories, to dismiss them, and to offer an alternative approach. I start with a brief formal character isation and suggestions of what work theories of interdiscourse relations are assumed to do (Section 2), followed by a discussion of the relation of such theories to naturalism and reductionism (Section 3). Section 4 gives examples of the omnipresence of interdiscourse discourse throughout sci ence and philosophy. In Section 5 I review problems that are encountered if one tries to be more precise about the meaning of "to underlie", and I conclude that the concept of supervenience is better abandoned. Up to this point the article is basically a critical review of the literature, pointing out some important connections and problems. In the second part of the paper I present my own view on the relation between different discourses, claiming that it is the manifest image that in the end determines the right categorisations in the Scientific Image and that if we want to raise the question of priority, it is the manifest image that controls the Scientific Image and not vice versa. All discourses are related by being grounded in the manifest image or daily world. This relation of "being grounded" might be considered a sort of supervenience or dependence, but not in the sense that the manifest image completely determines those other domains and even less in the sense that the referents of these discourses are constituted by elements of the manifest image.5 The Manifest/Scientific Image terminology stems from Sellars (1963),6 but I broaden the meaning of "manifest" intended by Sellars towards "man ifest social practices" and narrow it by keeping away from any association</page><page sequence="8">260 J. VAN BRAKEL of "manifest" with phenomenalism or sense data. The manifest image is the daily practice or common-sense-human-life-form and includes references to such things as water, cats on mats, and being angry about an injus tice; the Scientific Image is concerned about neurons, DNA, and quarks. Manifest forms of life are the manifest worlds of meaningful situations and behaviours in which we (already) live and which form the back ground for all scientific, philosophical, and all other activities. In the sense here intended the manifest image roughly corresponds with Wittgenstein's "form of life", Husserl 's Lebenswelt, Heidegger 's Dasein, in the sense these concepts are used, for example, in Dreyfus' (1992) critique of Artificial Intelligence. It also corresponds with van Fraassen's ( 1995) Vorverst?ndnis or with what Searle and others have called "background". Or with what Armstrong (1991b) and others have called the common sense or Moorean corpus, provided the latter is equally filled with facts and values.7 The latter is clearly the case with Putnam's (1994 ) "natural realism of the common man" which he associates with Husserl, Wittgenstein, Austin and James.8 I elaborate and illustrate my view that the manifest image has priority by means of two examples: schizophrenia (Section 6) and colour (Section 7). Section 8 is the conclusion and presents an alternative, albeit programmatic, understanding of interdiscourse relations, giving priority to the manifest image, but leaving room for autonomy in any particular discourse, for example the discourse of any particular scientific discipline. 2. THEORIES OF INTERDISCOURSE RELATIONS: A FIRST ENCOUNTER I noted already that the current philosophical buzz word to refer to interdis course relations is "supervenience"; less frequently it is called "determina tion", "reduction", or "emergence".9 The most common claim is that one kind of level or domain or description or discourse, S, overlays another kind of level or domain or description or discourse, B, if, in some sense of necessary, (51) it is necessary that if an 5-truth changes, some 5-truth changes; or: (52) necessarily, if two situations (objects, states, events) are identi cal in their B-properties they are identical in their 5-properties. The relation characterised by [SI] or [S2] or something like it is the proposed interdiscourse relation, giving a precise meaning to saying that B underlies S. For example, one might want to say that what happens</page><page sequence="9">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 261 in the brain underlies what happens at the mental or behavioural level, in which case "5" would correspond to "mental" or "behavioural" and "J9" would correspond to the brain. [SI] and [S2] are paraphrased from Blackburn (1984: 182; 1985: 48). Below I consider alternative formulations. I will use talk of "different domains", "different levels of description", and "different discourses" interchangeably (with a preference for the latter)10 and I will follow com mon sense natural realism in assuming that the objects and properties that arc talked about in whatever discourse, are real, unless it has been specif ically argued otherwise. The problem then is to give a plausible account of the relations between different descriptions or discourses (speaking more linguistically or epistemologically) or between "things" in different domains (speaking more metaphysically or ontologically).11 The connection with older ideas about reduction will be obvious: [SI] and [S2] are the generalised successors of the so called "bridge laws" or "linking propositions". Roughly speaking interdiscourse relations should have all the advantages of reduction and none of the disadvantages. Reduc tion has the advantage that it explains why events are not overdetermined. If an event has an S- and a 5-description and it can be assigned a cause (can be explained in terms of other S- and 2?-events respectively), the fact that, in principle, any S -description can be translated into (reduced to) a ^-description, provides a unified picture. The disadvantage of this picture is that it seems to undermine the autonomy of the 5-discourse unduly.12 In this paper I will concentrate on interdiscourse relations that are not causal (in the temporal sense). I follow Davidson (1970) in saying that causation is a relation between events, not between events as one thing or another. Events cause one another independently of how they are described, even independently of how they are identified. Then the problem of interdiscourse relations is that the same event (or causal chain or process) may be described in different discourses and the question is how these different descriptions are related. The same event can have a mental and a neurophysiological description, or a biological and a physical description, or a macroscopic and a microscopic physical description, and so on. Of course, the only way to talk about causes is under some description or other, but there is no favoured description, independent of particular interests and the particular surroundings of the event discussed (van Brakel, forthcoming). I put aside the suggestion that one could defend talk about an S -event being caused by a 5-event (or vice versa). If one reads through the entries in Table II, such a way of talking is often suggested,13 but I propose that in all such cases the suggestion that "B\ causes 62" should be read as short</page><page sequence="10">262 J. VAN BRAKEL for "B\ causes Bi and Si corresponds to B2" or as short for "S\ causes 52, B\ causes 2?2, S\ corresponds to B\9 and Si corresponds to Bi" or something more complicated along similar lines.14 Hence, for the purpose of this paper I put the causal relations aside and concentrate on the "jumps" from one discourse to another.15 It might be suggested that philosophical discussions about interdis course relations have nothing to do with the use of "to underlie" in collo quial scientific language, the main reason being that "to underlie" is vague, whereas philosophy should aim at precise definitions. As we'll see in sec tion 5, although philosophers try to give "to underlie" a precise meaning, there are many competing proposals and it is not clear at all how they should be understood, let alone what they imply (Heil 1992, Macdonald 1989, Seager 1991b). What seems to be reasonably clear is that as yet no proposed definition fulfils the promise of specifying "an appropriately strong ... relation of dependency ... that does not at the same time entail ... reducibility... via... 'bridge laws' or definition" (Marras 1993). Even if this much is clear, there remains the problem of giving precise definitions of "dependency", "reducibility", "bridge laws", "entail", and "definitions", and to give a precise exposition of the criteria for "appropriately strong". Therefore the claim to precision is wholly unwarranted: philosophers are equally subject to the use of easy, vague concepts as scientists who indulge in the use of "to underlie".16 3. MORE APPLICATIONS OF INTERDISCOURSE RELATIONS AND SOME PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS RAISED In addition to the variety of examples listed in Table II in this section I give some idea of the variety of other areas where the problem of interdis course relations arises. Within the physical discourse the subject is closely connected to discussions of microreductionism. Here are some examples. The property of being brittle overlays (depends on) having a particular molecular structure. For an ideal gas having temperature T overlays (is determined by) a conjunction of states representing the kinetic energy of the constituent molecules. Physical kinds underlie chemical kinds.17 With respect to the latter Kim says (1990: 14): chemical kinds ... and their microphysical compositions (at least, at one level of descrip tion) seem to strongly covary with each other, and yet it is true, presumably, that natural kinds are asymmetrically dependent on microphysical structures. Here our ... intuition, that macrophysical properties are asymmetrically dependent on microphysical structures, seems to be the major influence on our thinking, cancelling out the fact that the converse strong covariance may also be present.</page><page sequence="11">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 263 This example points to the problem of the (a-/anti-)symmetry of the relation between the over- and underlying discourse.18 A more serious question is whether it as self-evident as is generally assumed that "[m]acroproperties are determined by microproperties" (Kim 1995). Newman (1995) provides compelling arguments that "even the simple properties [like shape and mass] in terms of which physicists understand the macroscopic world do not necessarily covary with microscopic properties" (see also Section 8). Going one level "up" we get biological properties overlaying physical properties. The physical properties can be macroscopic or microscopic. Possible examples: Mendelian genes overlay DNA sequences; species selection overlays organismic selection (which overlays genie selection). But opinions on the precise renderings of these interdiscourse relations differ. For example, Rosenberg (1985:112): "Mendelian objects and prop erties supervene molecular ones: The latter fix the former ones completely, even though they cannot be connected to them in any manageable way". But Kincaid (1987, 1988) suggests that in a case like this we might have a many-many relation between 5- and J5-discourses. Elsewhere Rosen berg (1978) says: "The concept of'fitness' is supervenient on the manifest properties of organisms, their anatomical, physiological, behavioral, and environmentally relative properties". But H. A. Lewis (1985: 163) states: "fitness is partly determined by the frequency of a particular genotype in a population, and frequency, like uniqueness, is not a property of individuals at all". These examples point to the problem of delineating what is to be included in the B- and ??"-discourses in order that they can be "glued" together and what exactly it is they allegedly share in talking about "the same thing".19 Apart from the problem of multi-realisability it points to the problem of how to deal with probability concepts that are introduced when "moving" from the micro to the macro description. Going up further we get all kinds of other discourses overlaying the physical: the mental, the moral, the aesthetic, the social, and others. Most of the supervenience literature is concerned with the correlation of the mental or the moral with the physical. But one can also talk about actions by collectives overlaying actions by individuals.20 Surprisingly few writers however have considered the supervenience of the mental on the social (at least not in that terminology)21 - the hidden assumption of one way asymmetry again. For an example of the aesthetic overlaying the physical see Currie (1990). In this case it is self-evident that the value of, say, a painting does not simply depend on its intrinsic physical properties, but also on historical and relational facts which underlie the aesthetic quality. This points to the problem of holism in specifying interdiscourse relations.</page><page sequence="12">264 J. VAN BRAKEL Furthermore one can invoke supervenience when talking about the onto logical status of various more abstract domains. For example mathematics is a problem for naturalists. Hence (Armstrong 1989): "the apparently impotent entities [must be] supervenient on entities which are in some way causally potent". More generally we get: "discourse concerning abstract entities supervenes on concrete discourse" (Bonevac 1991). One can raise the question as to what space supervenes on, if anything (Cleland 1984). Causation and laws of nature can be said to supervene on matters of fact (i.e. causal properties supervene on noncausal properties), which might be called Humean supervenience (Campbell 1990; Cleland 1985; Kim 1983). Semantic concepts, like truth, might also be thought of as being supervened away (Van Cleve 1992); or it might be suggested that syntactic properties are supervenient on physical states. Similarly, adherents of a causal theory of reference may say that the reference of a term is determined by a proper ty ofthat term which supervenes on the history of its use. And naturalistic epistemologists may say that epistemic norms are irreducible to empirical facts but insist nonetheless that they supervene on psychological or social facts (which supervene on biological facts, and so on). All these exam ples illustrate the close connection between discussions of interdiscourse relations and a physicalist approach in philosophy. 4. THE DILEMMA OF NATURALISM AND AUTONOMY Definitions like [SI?2] are neutral in the sense that, in principle, the S and 5-discourse can be any sort of discourse. However, most literature on interdiscourse relations is motivated by a naturalistic metaphysics, in which case the 5-discourse, the base, is, in the end, physical: "all the facts about the world supervene on microscopic facts" (Kim 1993: 359). I surmise that the same applies to most uses of "to underlie". Therefore, in this paper, I will concentrate on this dominant naturalistic doctrine of interdiscourse relations. For present purposes I take physicalism, naturalism, and materialism to be the same: the differences between alternative definitions for one of these terms is as great as the differences between the terms. Perhaps the most thoughtful characterisation is that of Post (1987: 16f): "principles charac teristic of physicalist materialism [are]: (i) only physical entities exist; (ii) there can be no difference between things without some physical differ ence between them; and (iii) all truth whatever, whether in the sciences or beyond, is determined by truths at the level of physics". Note that (ii) and (iii) are naturalistic applications of [S2] and [SI] respectively.22 Applying this to the definitions of supervenience it can be glossed as saying that, in</page><page sequence="13">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 265 the end, physical truths (the B-truths in [SI]) fix all truths.23 Neverthe less, some sort of non-reductionism is aspired to, so that, somehow, the autonomy of different discourses can be safeguarded. Hence, there are three intuitions, motivations, or requirements that seem to underlie contemporary discussions about interdiscourse relations (Kim 1990):24 1. All interdiscourse relations, in the end, rest on an ultimate physical base (i.e. dependence). 2. Somehow interdiscourse relations must be explained in terms of things indiscernible from the 5-view being also indiscernible from the 5 view (i.e. co-variance). 3. Each ?"-discourse should be autonomous (i.e. non-reducibility). Contemplating the intuitive meaning of "dependence", "co-variance", and "non-reducibility" suggests that the task set is not an easy one (if coherent at all). Moreover, "supervenience dependence does not represent a single, homogeneous type of dependence" (Kim 1993: 166). The dilemma confronting current theories of interdiscourse relations is enshrined in their aim for non-reductive materialism.25 On the one hand the 5-discourse has to depend on the i?-discourse; on the other hand the S discourse should be autonomous. In response to this dilemma I suggest that most recent work on interdiscourse relations is best seen as a sophisticated version of the old mirror of nature paradigm. The picture is sophisticated because more than one mirror is invoked. Each mirror is two-sided and converts the "autonomous" pictures of (part of) the world into one another. One mirror?the "ideal" physical one - however mirrors reality as it really is. Therefore, all other mirrors overlay (part of) the ideal mirror. That is to say, interdiscourse relations are meant to be asymmetrical in a deep sense: the "ideal" physical picture is more real than the overlaying pictures. One could perhaps say that, on the one hand, the overlaying mirrors have some how emerged, but, on the other, they picture mere appearances, without cosmic significance. The purpose of work on interdiscourse relations can then be seen as showing that the content of the overlaying mirrors is not completely redundant (epiphenomenal), although the ideal physical mirror completely fixes the world. In all this, it is an open question what is to be included in the ideal mirror and what overlays it. I think this alone makes the whole issue of naturalism rather woolly. For example, it is not clear how to differentiate "ideal physics" (= physics basically as we know it, but better) and "IDEAL PHYSICS" (whatever "science" we have at the end of inquiry - it might include reference to souls, ESP, or something as yet unknown). Owing to</page><page sequence="14">266 J. VAN BRAKEL this problem "we lack any general criterion of 'physical object, property, or law' framed independently of existing physical theory" (Hellman 1985); and similarly for identifying all physically possible worlds.26 There is also the problem of chance entering into the most fundamental physical picture of what there is. Contrary to the physicalistic root metaphor underlying most work on supervenience and most uses of "to underlie", I suggest that relations between discourses are either symmetrical or, when asymmetrical, draw on the manifest image, not the Scientific Image, as the base discourse. That is to say, it is the objects and categories in the manifest image that are ontologically prior in the following sense: "These are the elements which are accepted into the ontology, but not on the grounds that they are constructed from other objects. They are, in a sense, just accepted into the ontology" (Fine 1991). Of course, objects in the manifest image may be given up because of developments in the Scientific Image, but judging this is a judgement in the manifest image. Before embarking on this in Sections 6?8,1 will review some more problems current theories of interdiscourse relations face. 5. PINNING DOWN THE IDEA OF INTERDISCOURSE RELATIONS: SOME MORE PROBLEMS Recent developments in the literature on interdiscourse relations are dom inated by publications of Kim (1984a, 1984b, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993), who has distinguished weak, strong, and global forms:27 (WS) S weakly overlays B: necessarily any two things that have the same properties in B have the same properties in S (that is, 5-indiscernibility entails ?-indiscernibility). ((WS) is similar to (SI) and (S2).) (SS) S strongly overlays B: for any x and y and any possible worlds V and W if x has in V the same 5-properties that y has in W then x has in V the same 5-properties that y has in W. (This extends (WS) to counterfactual situations, giving it law like force.) (GS) S globally overlays B: any two worlds that are 5-indiscernible are also 5-indiscernible. (This moves away from particular interdiscourse relations.) But there are many problems with these definitions. [WS] seems too weak to capture the sense of dependence intended because it allows that in coun terfactual situations S doesn't overlay B.28 In response [SS] was proposed,</page><page sequence="15">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 267 but [SSI requires a lawlike correlation between the S- and f?-properties, which seems too strong as it would allow straightforward translations of the 5- into the 5-discourse, independent of context.29 Hence [SS] would not define a non-reductionistic interdiscourse relation.30 Perhaps there fore [GS] is a better option.31 [GS] is the variant that comes nearest to slogans like "No difference without a physical difference" (taking "J5" as "physical") which shows its weakness, at least for practical concerns: [GS] doesn't say anything about particular interdiscourse relations.32 Review ing the problems supervenience theories face, Kim (1989), in his Pres idential Address to the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association, summarised the situation in the philosophy of mind as fol lows: "We must conclude that supervenience is not going to deliver to us a viable form of nonreductive materialism... nonreductive materialism is not a stable position. There are pressures of various sorts that push it either in the direction of outright eliminativism or in the direction of an explicit form of dualism".33 I already noted that most writers on interdiscourse relations talk about asymmetrical relations, but none of the proposed definitions given above expresses this fact.34 Do interdiscourse relations have to be asymmetrical? Armstrong (1989: 104) suggests that it is desirable at least to begin by allowing symmetrical relations. But this is clearly a minority view. The dominant view is that the underlying discourse should somehow be prior to the overlaying discourse.35 So, apparently, one has to understand "S supervenes on f?" as implying that B does not supervene of S. Often the requirement of asymmetry seems to be identified simply with the possibility of multiple realisation, although this phenomenon itself would seem to suggest an opposite asymmetry: it is the ?'-description that specifies which B-descriptions will be selected in the base on which S supervenes. Is it a relation of determination or dependence or both? Grimes (1991) suggests that a relation of determination is deterministic and sufficient, whereas a relation of dependence is necessary and can be indeterministic. This seems a useful distinction, but many writers use the two terms as syn onyms (Kim 1984, 1989, 1990; Bonevac 1991) and clearly the distinction isn't made in the use of "to underlie" either (cf. Table II). Newman (1995) has suggested that the only relation that can give the wanted asymmetry is that of control (as in the way a charge distribution controls an electric field). Another problem of the proposed definitions is that they set no con straints on the kind of properties that are admissible at the B- and S level.36 Intuitively, only "natural" properties should be allowed, but it proves extremely difficult to specify the meaning of "natural" (van Brakel</page><page sequence="16">268 J. VAN BRAKEL 1992a), as the following two quotations may illustrate.37 Horgan (1982: 36) says: "The appropriate restriction, I think, is that the relevant kinds must be natural kinds. Providing an adequate philosophical account of natural kinds is no trivial task, of course, but I shall leave that task to one side here". And Currie (1990: 246) confesses: "Of course I'm in no good position to say exactly what it takes for a property to be natural, though I assume that by and large we can agree on particular cases". An easy way out may seem to be to opt for global interdiscourse relations.38 But as a consequence of allowing holism across whole worlds it becomes unclear how we could ever have evidence for or against faith in global interdiscourse relations (P?trie 1987; Kim 1987,1989). Moreover, if all properties and relations are included it is unclear how to avoid the possi bility that interdiscourse relations would be satisfied vacuously.39 Finally, the truth of global interdiscourse relations is of little direct relevance for clearing up the meaning of "to underlie" in specific contexts. Another substantial problem is an unclarity about whether the proposed interdiscourse relations are to safeguard only "property autonomy" or also "objecf'-autonomy.40 Most proposals assume that there is one fundamental domain, "a single domain of individuals" (Kim 1993: xi). But as Casta?eda (1990) asks: "one single domain of individuals ... composes the whole of reality. But what are those individuals?" Presumably those individuals would be whatever Final Science would say they were. Casta?eda however argues for a more liberal concept of interdiscourse relations. Persons for example as possessors of psychological states are not strictly identical with their bodies: "Let's call emergent properties those properties that accrue to a whole because it has certain parts and because of the interaction of these parts with its environment. Let's call such wholes emergent individuals or objects". But this, as yet, is a minority view and not worked out in any detail.41 The question of the "nature" of the difference between the S and B discourse also turns up in the relation of interdiscourse relations to expla nation. Here too there is a tension between determinacy and autonomy. On the one hand the naturalistic view requires that when one event explains another in virtue of both falling under a non-physical generalisation, this explanation must be underwritten by a physical explanation. On the other hand the base discourse does not have the relevant kind terms referring to the event in question. Hence, in some sense the base-level explana tion seems to be incomplete, in particular in cases of multirealisability. This point has been made in numerous publications and was already used against traditional reductionistic accounts.42</page><page sequence="17">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 269 Finally, most definitions of interdiscourse relations refer to objects or worlds or other things being "exactly similar in every respect" (Owens 1989), or"exactly alike" (Oddie 1991; Lewis 1983:355), or "indiscernible" (Grimes 1991), or "identical" (Horgan 1982), or "duplicates" (Davies 1992), or "having exactly the same properties and relations" (Armstrong 1989). What does it mean to say that two objects are "exactly alike"? The problem passed over here is that in the actual world there are no two objects that are exactly alike.43 At the very least there are no macroscopic objects that are exactly alike, because, for one thing, their properties depend on the context (including their history).44 Because allegedly identical objects occupy a different place, their contexts are different, if only slightly so.45 In view of all these problems my conclusion about the achievements of supervenience theories to account for interdiscourse relations to date is completely negative. Bonevac (1991) writes: "Supervenience, its advo cates suggest, makes precise our intuitive conceptions of dependence and determination". But it seems that we're still a long way from the perspicu ity of this alleged precision.46 There's a large discrepancy between what supervenience is expected to achieve and what the proposed definitions of supervenience actually offer. It is even unclear how what supervenience is expected to achieve can be expressed unambiguously. Still, this doesn't mean that theories of interdiscourse relations don't address important prob lems - on the contrary. So my negative conclusion is a plea to develop better theories of interdiscourse relations. In the remaining sections I will address one particular aspect which, I suggest, such new theories would have to incorporate, viz. the need to acknowledge a certain priority of the manifest image. 6. THE PRIORITY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE: THE CASE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA I now come to the more positive part of the paper, in which I present arguments to the effect that in interdiscourse relations the manifest image has priority, or at least much more priority than is generally assumed. In this section and the next, two examples are discussed, schizophrenia and colour, both of which are involved in many different discourses. There are many paradigms for schizophrenia, but I think it is fair to say that they roughly fall apart in two groups: for and against what I will call biological psychiatry. According to the paradigm of biological psychiatry there is no doubt what schizophrenia is: 1. Schizophrenia derives from certain genetic dispositions, which are necessary but not sufficient. It depends on the context (the environ</page><page sequence="18">270 J. VAN BRAKEL ment) whether the underlying genetic trait (or combination(s) of genet ic traits) will actually emerge into a manifest case of schizophrenia. 2. Schizophrenia overlays certain neurophysiological characteristics. There is still uncertainty about what these characteristics might be, but whatever they are, there must be something in the brains of schizophrenics that is different: "schizophrenia is a brain dysfunction" (Gray et al. 1992: 58, emphasis added). Critics of biological psychiatry tend to use their ammunition primar ily against the (alleged) dependence of schizophrenia on genetic factors. For example: "According to this ideology, family members of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia possess a mysterious genetic code for schizophrenia, an enigmatic essence of schizophrenia; enigmatic because it is not always expressed, always present but latent, waiting to declare itself should a psychosocial Stressor trigger it off' (Barrett 1988).47 Writ ers advocating a neurological explanation may however be neutral with respect to what underlies it "further down" (Gray et al. 1991: 61). There fore there may be more of a continuity of opinions than the dichotomy for or against biological psychiatry might suggest.48 In a way the dichotomy has more to do with how optimistic one is about the unity and progress of science than anything else, as the following quotations may illustrate: The future looks bright, indeed. Investigators can consider the following assets that have recently converged to enhance the study of schizophrenia: National Institute of Mental Health leadership in designating schizophrenia as the priority area for new research devel opment ... Scientific methods and eloquent approaches to data management and analysis that can be applied at every level of investigation. We can confidently anticipate the creative acquisition of new knowledge as the infrastructure of schizophrenia research is expanded. (Carpenter 1987) In any case, it seems that the highly qualified research performed during the last half century has not brought us much closer to solving the riddle of schizophrenia. An enormous amount of useful observations have been made, and we must of course continue to collect facts, and to refine our methodology so that what we find really are facts. It is like in court: we should provide the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. With regard to the causes of schizophrenia, we seem by now to have found nearly everything ? except the truth. (Stromgren 1987) The 1990's should see the final unveiling of the precise disorder that results in schizophre nia. This knowledge will give us the identity of the gene(s) responsible and thus pave the way for genetic screening, more effective therapy and, ultimately, a cure. (Roberts 1990) During the last decade, schizophrenia has been a major target of research; yet, we continue to discover how little we know, how poorly we understand this disorder and its evolution, and how helpless we are to treat it. It is as if the more we improve our tools to describe and</page><page sequence="19">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 271 study schizophrenia, the more it seems to escape definition, to be clouded with uncertainty, to defy treatment. (Corin 1990) In what follows I'm only concerned with the biological paradigm, but I draw attention to the other side because anti-biological psychiatrists do contribute to identifying what schizophrenia is in the first place. That is to say: articles on the genetic, neurophysiological, and other biological aspects of schizophrenia report their research referring to schizophrenic patients/individuals/subjects/brains/genotypes/etc., where the reference of "schizophrenic" is determined by clinical symptoms, which refer to the manifest characteristics of schizophrenia (as specified in standards like DSM-IV or ICD-10), not to brain or genetic properties. Let's make things concrete and take one particular biological theory about schizophrenia as an example. According to Meehl (1990) to anal yse schizophrenia three levels of description should he distinguished: a psychological one (schizotypy), an inherited brain integrative dysfunction (schizotaxia) and a specific neuronal mechanism (hypokrisia). Meehl's theory can be summarised as follows (1990: 14, 35, 14): the most striking fact about these patients that makes them unique in psychopathology is their "slippage" (Bleuler's associative loosening), both the "cognitive slippage" and the cognitive-affective slippage ... The broadest definition is that schizotaxia is a genetically determined integrative defect, predisposing to schizophrenia and a sine qua non for that disorder, although ... only a minority of persons with the CNS [Central Neural System] defect decompensate to the point of being diagnosable [as schizophrenics]... whatever is wrong with the schizotaxic CNS is ubiquitous, a functional aberration present throughout... this "something wrong at all levels" is something wrong about the way the individual neurons work, a functional parametric aberration of the synaptic control system. Meehl's theory is not generally accepted, to say the least. In the 500+ references of the article of Gray et al. (1991) on the neuropsychology of schizophrenia (cf. Table I), there is not one reference to the work of Meehl. But this doesn't matter for present purposes. There are many other theories about how schizophrenia overlays the biological. But they all have in com mon that whatever the alleged underlying traits of schizophrenia are (call this the m/crodiscourse), we have to start with some clear manifest cases described in behavioural, psychological, and socio-historical terms (call this the wacrodiscourse or the manifest discourse). Variations in the vari ables which characterise all possible brain characteristics can be classified in an indefinite number of ways. Which of those have to be correlated with "normal" mentality and which with particular types of manifest abnormal mentality is not written on their sleeves. We have to identify them as indi</page><page sequence="20">272 J. VAN BRAKEL cators of schizophrenia by establishing how the brain characteristics differ between "schizophrenics" and "normals" and these two groups are identi fied by diagnostic macrocriteria using manifest characteristics of people's social and cognitive behaviour. I chose schizophrenia as an example because the diagnostic criteria (i.e. the criteria of similarity for the manifest category of schizophre nia) are quite fuzzy. As yet, for diagnosis, only behavioural criteria are used. Moreover, with changing definitions of schizophrenia its boundaries have expanded and contracted over the past 100 years and are not the same in different countries.49 Physical parameters that might correlate with schizophrenia include such things as smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, visible capillary flexus of the nail fold and particular evoked potential anomalies and it is possible that in the future such "more objective measurements" would be included in the clinical definition of schizophre nia. But then this revised definition would be based on established cor relations between these physical parameters and the kind of behavioural criteria that are currently used to identify schizophrenics. To make sense of biopsychiatric research macroscopic and microscopic criteria must be (at least roughly) co-extensive in what they identify. In a manifest case of schizophrenia, there must be just those genetic dispositions and synaptic loosenings, for Meehl's theory to be true: obvious manifest cases must correlate with synaptic loosenings. But the presence of synaptic loosenings doesn't require the presence of manifest schizophrenia, for, on the assumed model of Meehl, the genetic dispositions and synaptic loosen ings are, at best, a necessary, not a sufficient condition for schizophrenia. Therefore what schizophrenia is cannot be those synaptic loosenings. The judgement of a particular manifest case of schizophrenia might be mistaken, but such a mistake has to be sorted out at the macrolevel, relative to the prevailing manifest criteria and reported cases of "obvious" or "typi cal" schizophrenia. In practice, there is no way that a case of schizophrenia can be identified solely and definitively by measurements at the base level. There simply are too many boundary (environmental) conditions that play a role apart from the alleged necessary conditions (synaptic loosenings, or whatever). And because of these complexities, the empirical correla tions supporting the scientific belief that certain microcharacteristics are necessary conditions are, at the very best, ceteris paribus laws, leaving room for any number of alternative understandings of schizophrenia (or its absence) in contexts other than those that figured in establishing the proposed empirical correlation between the micro- and macrocategories. It might be suggested that if, as is often supposed, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous category, it will be research into the underlying mechanisms</page><page sequence="21">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 273 that will establish the proper recategorisation (of mental illnesses). There are two possibilities: 1. It is discovered that instead of one category, there are several, each having its own macro-micro correlation of parameters. Although the recategorisation may be stimulated by discoveries on the J9-level, it only makes sense if the separation of macroscopic markers makes sense. For example, in the case of schizophrenia there has been the suggestion that there is a relationship between the so called positive negative symptom distinction which holds at the diagnostic level and an as yet undiscovered underlying dichotomy. If attempts to correlate dichotomies at both levels were to succeed, the dichotomy in the under lying discourse would have been identified in terms of the relevance or salience of the positive-negative manifest symptom distinction. 2. If in the macroscopic discourse there were to be no recategorisation, we would have a case of multiple realisation of the same thing, viz. schizophrenia. Either different gene "defects" (or birth disorders or whatever) might underlie the same brain defect and/or different brain defects might underlie the same personality disorder. Although such differences might suggest different treatments, it remains the case that each separate set of similarity criteria in the base discourse(s) is identified as relevant relative to the manifest category of schizophrenia. The same reasoning applies to many other micro-macro relations. Con sider that (Post 1987: 217): Two masses of gas exactly alike in relevant mechanical respects may be observed repeatedly to be alike also in some given thermodynamic respect. Or two cells exactly alike in relevant molecular-biological respects may be observed always to be alike in some given aspect of their overt behaviour. Or two organisms alike in relevant neurological respects may be observed always to be alike as regards their learning ability. In all cases what is relevant in the micro discourse is, in the end, determined in terms of the manifest discourse. It doesn't make sense to say to somebody who is complaining/suffering from hallucinations: "Listen dear, you're not having hallucinations. We've checked your VIP-levels and they're all right. You cannot have hallucinations. The expert system of the Institute for Progress in Medicine too confirms that you cannot be hallucinating". 7. THE PRIORITY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE: THE CASE OF COLOUR The essence of colour might be something to do with wavelengths of light, reflective or other dispositional properties of surfaces or objects</page><page sequence="22">274 J. VAN BRAKEL "out there", computational properties of psychophysical colour modules, opponent properties of cells in the retina and visual cortex, the evolutionary co-emergence of all of this, or something else again. I won't bother about these different accounts or aspects, merely taking for granted that the recognition, perception, naming, etc. of colours overlays events in the brain. How would we go about identifying these brain events? If we delve into the neurophysiology of colour perception we find, inter alia, that the activation levels of the following neurons are relevant to perceiving, say, pure red (and not some other colour): cones, horizontal and ganglion cells in the retina; more ganglion cells of several types in the parvocellular layer of the LGN (Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, in the thalamus); numerous types of cells in areas V\,V2 and V4 of the striate cortex. Moreover, in a 49-page article describing "the bewildering variety of colour-coded cell types", Livingstone and Hubel (1984) refer to a "a dozen or so areas north of the striate cortex" of which the (colour) vision properties still need to be investigated. They end their article by saying: "If complexity continues to escalate, future papers will probably be even longer". That complexity will make it difficult, if not impossible, to say exactly which neurophysiological "part" corresponds to seeing red.50 But let's loosen up a bit. Let's be content with events that are "roughly" the same: a few hundred more or less firing neurons doesn't matter. How are we then going to set some reasonable criteria for "prototypical" or "abnormal" sets of firing neurons which underlie "seeing red"? As in the case of schizophrenia the only way to identify "red" at the base level is to check what correlates with saying that something looks red. On a global, superholistic, level we can be naturalists: no flicker of red without some firing neurons. But to say this, it is not even assumed that neurons belong to the inventory of the universe. It just means: no change without a phys ical change. Any support for this thesis comes from local interdiscourse relations that work the other way round, manifest categories being prior to the particular microcategories that allegedly underlie the macrocategories. It is the base domain that is the dependent discourse, not the determining one. The possibility of compositional and/or computational plasticity adds to the priority of the manifest image. Assume a sophisticated Land colorime ter or another computational model for colour always comes up with the right "colour codes". According to Land (1986) a colour patch in a field of vision can be defined in terms of a triple of numbers representing the three relative lightnesses of this patch as "recorded" by the three types of retinal cones. Using physical luminance as a measure of phenomenal lightness an instrument can compute the triples of relative lightnesses after screening</page><page sequence="23">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 275 the whole field of vision, measuring local lightness on three scales (scaled in accordance with the absorption properties of the three retinal cones). If we were to decide to ascribe to this instrument (which doesn't have any neurons) the capacity to observe chartreuse and the other colour shades (putting aside the question of qualia), it is because the results of its compu tations are first calibrated relative to human observations and then proven to correlate well with further human observations. At every stage of the investigation? say, whether or not the instrument "sees" after-images ? it is our manifest agreement on what is similar and what is not that sets the standards.51 Actually, in the case of colour, the dominance of the manifest image which identifies the relevant microproperties simply follows from the fact that there is no "natural" way of classifying colours. For example, there are cultures which have one basic colour category, for example Kwakw'ala Ihenxa, where we have two (yellow and green); other cultures have two conceptually and perceptually irreducible or atomic colour categories,52 for example Russian goluboj and sinij,53 where we have one (blue). That is to say, in different cultures we have to identify different sets of complex patterns of neurons firing, which underlie the locally prevailing colour categories. In view of this proliferation of culture-dependent interdiscourse relations, we might be inclined to go a little bit more global and say that there are interdiscourse relations for the whole range of humanly possible colour discriminations (leaving the problem of the interdiscourse relations of colour categories for some other time). However, then the problem of identifying what the relevant categories are just comes back at a different level. The suggestion that there is a continuous set of colour experiences which overlays a particular "modular" range of sets of neuron firings assumes that there is a separate domain of "pure" colour; and this is not supported cross-culturally (or even locally: see Davidoff 1991). For example, in other cultures, the colour category may be indistinguishably mixed up with other experiential or evaluative categories. This is not the place to review the literature on cross-cultural colour naming, but I will give two more detailed examples in support of the previ ous paragraph to prevent the impression that I'm only speculating.54 As a first example consider the prevalence of a yellow/green colour category in numerous languages on the Northwest Coast of Canada (Saunders 1992). For example, Kinkade (1988) says: The 23 Salishan languages contain nearly 90 different roots pertaining to colors, and this figure does not include the many terms ... pertaining to colors of horses... Salishan color systems are of particular interest because of the common pattern of having a single term referring to green and yellow and another for blue ...</page><page sequence="24">276 J. VAN BRAKEL I would suggest, then, the following reconstructions [for Proto-Salish] ... black... white ... red ... light blue ... yellow-green ... To these can be added ... gray, faded ... and there is weaker evidence for ... dark blue-green ... red ... and ... red ... If all these suggested reconstructions and their glosses are accepted as given, Proto-Salish had a very strange color system indeed: black, white, and gray, the yellow-green-blue area split into three almost horizontal strata (from light to dark), and three kinds of red. Of course it is possible to dispute details of Kinkade's reconstruction of Proto-Salish, but it won't remove the overwhelming evidence, from first contact onwards, that most Salish languages have one word covering yellow and green. The same is the case for the neighbouring Wakashan languages (Saunders 1992). One might expect that the anomaly would be quickly dissolved when speakers of those languages are "reminded" of the psychophysical "fact" that yellow and green are two different unique colours (Urfarben). But this doesn't happen. Most current speakers of Sal ishan and Wakashan languages are bilingual. They know perfectly well what the difference is in English between yellow and green, but they stick to one word in their own language. For about 80-100 years Kwakw'ala speakers (a Wakashan language) have been using ayendzis for orange, which most speakers still recognise as a loan word; some speakers nowa days use pinkstu, a neologism coined for 'pink' (Saunders 1992). But yellows and greens are simply Ihenxa. The obvious counter-suggestion is to say that Ihenxa overlays the union of two unique colours at a deeper (sub)cognitive level. But it seems to me too much of a coincidence that the "natural" categories at the deeper non-linguistic level always happen to be categories already named in colloquial twentieth century English. The above example assumes that what is and what is not a colour word is straight-forward. I think this assumption rarely warranted when consid ering non-western cultures (or even western cultures a few centuries and more ago). The appearance of conformity with modern colour categori sations is a post-contact artefact. For example, Bulmer (1968) reports the following on Karam "colour" words (Karam words are in italics): As applied to fruit (banana, papaws) it [i.e. pk] covers the Munsell ratings approximately 5YR-5Y6-8/7-8; as applied to human skin, approximately 2.5-5YR4?5/4?6, which would normally be described as gs ["dull brown, green, or olive"] or gac ["dirt or mud"] in the case of fruit skins. Another example is that of Ika: applied in the case of bird plumage to bright reds and purples in the range 5RP-2.5YR 4?8/8?12, whereas it is applied to plant foliage in the duller purple ranges delimited by 10P-10RP3-8/2-8, which would normally be described as mosb ["black, dark"] or gac [sub taxon of mosb and its word taboo substitute] if they occurred on bird feathers ... Karam do not use the standard terms for "green" in describing vegetation ... Leaf surfaces of Munsell rating 5GY/4/4 were variously identified as mosb ("dark"), wain ("yellow" [roughly co-extensive with/??]) and Iban ("succulent green"), depending on the context of comparison with other leaves, stems or other vegetal parts.</page><page sequence="25">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 277 As in the previous example it might be suggested that what is wrong with the Karam people is that there language messes up their experiences at the purely cognitive level. At the physiological level, the argument would run, Karam people (like us) have a well defined modular colour space and the colours of the environment are mapped in this pre-linguistic colour space and ordered in exactly the same way as ordinary English speakers would describe it. This boils down to saying that all people are physiologically the same in this respect, but that only 20th century English (and a few other European languages) accurately represent the structure of this pre linguistic space. The possibility that this is an ethnocentric mistake seems overwhelming, unless one has the secret insight that English is the pinnacle of specular evolution. (An interesting exercise might be to describe the results of neurophysiological research on colour perception using Karam or Kwakw'ala "colour" words instead of the English ones.) So not only do we need to know what underlies the awareness of the chromatic aspects of the world, or what underlies the utterance that the orange is orange, we also need to know what underlies Ihenxa or Iban. The only way to identify the relevant underlying neural events or functional roles or state space vectors or whatever is relative to people who say and seem to agree that this is green o?* Ihenxa or Iban (as the case may be). The common mistake is to think that there must be a simple correlate for "green" in the brain or its physical description, whereas Ihenxa or Iban are complex (or primitive, metaphorical) categories. 8. CONCLUSION: THE PRIORITY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE To add another metaphor to the multiple mirrors I introduced in Section 4, one could say that most theories of interdiscourse relations and the scientific use of verbs like "to underlie" assume a multi-level ideal language to describe one world: one base of Ding-an-Sich-type physical referents and many overlaying conceptual (or computational, or ... ) levels. It is time to drop this worn-out and mistaken view of the unity of science and progress. Instead we should look for a changing plurality of pragmatically real levels or domains, which are kept together, not by physicalism as a unity of science doctrine, but by the categories and criteria in the manifest image. The idea is not original.55 William James (1907 [1981: 115]) said (italics in original): Reality, we naturally think, stands ready-made and complete, and our intellects supervene with the one simple duty of describing it as it is already. But... [w]e add, both to the subject and to the predicate part of reality ... The essential contrast is that for rationalism reality is ready-made and complete for all eternity, while for pragmaticism it is still in the making, and awaiting part of its complexion from the future.</page><page sequence="26">278 J. VAN BRAKEL I read this as saying that reality (what the basic distinctions are, what the relevant levels and domains are) is under continuing (re-)construction, or perhaps better: the categories we employ are a manifestation of the life we live. No matter how marvellous and attractive some new worlds or realities may seem to be, in the end they are all grounded in and the product of some current entrenched manifest images.56 Therefore we need a different approach to the relation between different levels or domains. The difference we need is a reversal of the microreductionist intuition that goes with the current usage of "supervenience" and "to underlie". So, I propose we turn the concepts of "supervenience" and "to underlie" upside down. Everything worth talking about depends on the categories and intuitions embedded in the manifest image, the latter expression covering a family of images overlaying multiplicities of similar forms of (human) life. It is the manifest image that underlies the Scientific Image, not the other way round. Many will say that even if it is accepted that the manifest image picks out relevant properties at the micro-level and therefore is epistemically prior, this doesn't imply that the Scientific Image supervenes on the manifest image in the ontological or metaphysical sense. The short reply is basically that of Carnap (1956): local ontologies are dependent on the choice of a language, on pragmatic considerations (grounded in the manifest image).57 Raising what Carnap called external ontological questions is nonsensical: it is an appeal to First Philosophy which is not available to the physicalist who wants to defend the Scientific Image. In addition to the concrete examples of colour and schizophrenia, I would like to list most of the issues that have to be addressed by those who might want to give priority to the Scientific Image. (Similar arguments apply if it were claimed that the Philosophical or Metaphysical Image should be given priority.) Sellars (1963) thought, and many with him, that the Scientific Image could claim priority because science can give, in principle, a more com plete, if not the complete, world picture. But attempts by philosophers of science in the earlier part of this century to provide a picture of science unified by one method have failed. Attempts to specify a notion of reduc tion so that all sciences would fit into one world picture have failed.58 As I have shown in this paper attempts to cover up these failures by talking about supervenience have failed as well. The unity and pragmatism of the manifest image cannot fail, because it sustains everything. The ontology of common sense is highly pluralistic.59 Cross-culturally only something like the manifest image is shared (van Brakel 1994a). Appeals to IDEAL PHYSICS, "the best total causal account of the world", or "the language of completed total science" are empty.60 Even if</page><page sequence="27">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 279 it were true that the world "consists basically of a relatively small number of kinds of fundamental particles or fields" (Bigelow et al. 1992), or "quarks and their compounds, also classes of such things, classes of such classes, and so on, pending evidence to the contrary" (Quine 1992), or if it were true "that the whole history of the universe corresponds to properties of the whole sequence of natural numbers" (Dirac 1939), it is completely unclear how explanations about the behaviour of people would follow from such fundamentals, without appeal to the sort of concepts employed in folk psychology. It is already unclear how explanations of chemical reactions would follow from such fundamentals.61 It is often suggested that basic science provides knowledge of strict laws, whereas the manifest image can deliver mere correlations at best. That there are no strict laws in the special sciences (like psychology) is a point often made. That there are no strict laws at all is perhaps less plau sible. Here I can only do some hand waving in support of this suggestion. Macroscopic physical laws are all ceteris paribus: The boiling point of water is 100 degrees centigrade, but not if it is sea water, not if it is boiled on top of the Mount Everest or contained in small capillaries, or if heavy water (deuterium oxide) is used, and so on. Even our most paradigmatic laws are neither exceptionless nor true (Cartwright 1983). If we look for more fundamental laws we get lost in the conceptual troubles of quantum mechanics (Healy 1991).62 Similarly, the assumption that there are natural kinds is highly dis putable.63 Different taxonomies serve different functions or interests, not only the different interests of either science or common sense, but also different taxonomies serving different interests within common sense and within science (Dupr? 1993; Putnam 1990: 95). Depending on those inter ests kinds may even be individuals in another context (as in the case of biological species). The choice of natural kind groupings will be related to what kinds of causal processes are of greatest relevance (as in taking the atom H and the ion H+ as different or the same natural kind). Talk of phys ical causality is a late refinement of ordinary talk of causes, dispositions, and "powers"; and if anything scientific can be said about causes it is that they have to go with the rest of folk wisdom.64 Certainly the "Principle of Causal Individuation" (Kim 1993: 326) is not part of science.65 Sometimes it is suggested that the development of quantum mechanics has undermined any traditional picture of science as being concerned with imperceptible things, constituting in their interactions the causal struc ture of the world. Quantum mechanics would force us to the view that everything there is overlays chance events (Lewis 1986: xiv; Rosenberg 1992). But note that the idea of a world of "real" chance derives from</page><page sequence="28">280 J. VAN BRAKEL the manifest image ? an idea already discussed by Aristotle and Cicero (van Brakel 1976). Also the chance events described by quantum mechan ics only exist relative to a higher order belief in the limit of chance (van Brakel 1991b). There's no way therefore for quantum mechanics to break out of its dependence on the regularities in the manifest image. The progress of science is built on a projectable sequence of projectable predicates (including "meta" predicates), but at the most fundamental lev el progress depends on intuitions and categories that are entrenched in the prevailing manifest image. Think of logic: at the metametalevel we use ordinary English to discuss its relevance and validity.66 Discussions about the status of set theory and the foundations of mathematics are ram pant with appeals to informal intuitions.67 Think of quantum mechanics. As Bohr stressed, there is no way of testing the predictions of quantum mechanics without appealing to macroscopic objects and colloquial lan guage to describe experiments.68 More generally: theoretical science can only be applied by adding something (initial conditions, the location of the user of science) that is not part of theoretical science (van Fraassen 1992). The initial and boundary conditions are independent of and conceptually distinct from the theoretical laws.69 The distinction between normal and abnormal conditions is not something that "could be summed up in a closed formula in the language of physics" (Putnam 1987: 11). If one is invited to use a technical language (in science, philosophy, etc.) this request is to be judged in ordinary language. Attempts to define fundamental epistemic concepts are all doomed to circularity or appeal to "intuitions" that are not further justified (Moser 1991). All scientific categories derive their existence in part from normative methodological criteria (the epistemic and pragmatic virtues). These crite ria are grounded, in the end, in the manifest image. Notions like "adjudi cating", "cause", "explanation", "reasonable", "truth", "right", "relevant", and so on are firmly and finally grounded in the pre-theoretical manifest image ? which is not to say that these notions are incapable of change and variation. Standards of evidence, reasons, warrant, truth and the avoidance of error, etc. are neither typical for, nor justified/ratified by science alone: plausible epistemic virtues are not restricted to science (Dupr? 1993: 243; Haack 1993).70 I'm not saying that because of its priority the explanations of the man ifest image are "by definition" as good or better than scientific explana tions.71 My point is that, in the end, the judgement that an explanation is better than another is based on judgements grounded in the manifest image. Some kind of explanatory attitude is an essential part of any form of (human) life. And this conception implies that not all explanations are</page><page sequence="29">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 281 equally good. This is true independent of there being science or a Sci entific Image around or not. One might say: "Science could explain, for example, how explanation, communication, and normativity are possible among humans". Of course, but how is the request for such an explanation finally justified? Moreover, there will be alternative "sciences" to offer explanations of whatever is considered relevant to explain. To make a judgement with regard to these alternatives we are committed, explicitly or tacitly, to making judgements on issues like "deciding which features of science we value most", "rightness", "appropriate to the circumstances", and so on (Elgin 1989). Judgements on such issues are always grounded in the manifest image and cannot be "bootstrapped out of it". This is not possible because there is not a value-laden world out there that is simply to be described as it is. Hence there is no transcendental or self-correcting inductive method that systematically comes closer to what is right. The only way out of it would be to appeal to exactly one best method of inquiry and exactly one best end of enquiry which gives THE answers. Such an answer is only possible in Brave New World and its congeners. NOTES 1 I follow the common usage of cause and effect being temporally separated. 2 Dictionary entries for "to underlie" include: to submit to the will or direction of; to lie or to be situated under; to be at the basis of, to support, to form the foundation of; to lie concealed beneath the obvious exterior of; to exist as a claim or security superior and prior to. 3 Crane (1995) makes a strong distinction between the "is" of strict identity and the "is" of constitution, but it seems that many authors are equally ambiguous on this point. 4 One reason for the increased interest in interdiscourse relations is that the significance of multiple realisation took away much of the force of type-type reductionism in the phi losophy of mind (Kim 1984a, 1992a). Of course, the plausibility of multiple realisation applies to other discourses as well: the biological (Rosenberg 1978; Kincaid 1988), the social (Kincaid 1990; Tuomela 1990), and the macrophysical (Kim 1984b). For example (Rosenberg 1978: 370): "two organisms can have quite different physical properties and yet share exactly the same level of fitness in respect of a given environment". Most recently the interest seems to have shifted back again from supervenience to reductionism, because "it is not as easy to combine physicalism with non-reductionism as current orthodoxy sup poses" (Papineau 1992; see also Kim 1992a; Crane 1995). There are also some writers, for example Churchland (1989), who haven't bothered about non-reductive materialism and have stuck to old fashioned reductionism (combined with eliminativism - which I believe eliminates itself: van Brakel 1993b). 5 Something is "grounded" if it is accepted on the basis of something which does not, at this moment, require further justification. It is where, to paraphrase Wittgenstein, my, your, our, or their spade is turned. Terms that are related include "entrenchment", "habit", "instinct". See, apart from Wittgenstein, the writings of Dewey, Goodman, Peirce. The point of this</page><page sequence="30">282 J. VAN BRAKEL paper is that wherever grounding stops, it stops in the manifest, not the scientific image. But this in no way implies that where justification stops now, it is to stay forever. Often the later Wittgenstein and the American pragmatists are interpreted as saying (taking Peirce's tem minology as an example), that belief that has settled is fixed forever. But that is the wrong reading. What is settled (entrenched, habitual, certain, instinctive) is thereby grounded, but what is settled can always be unsettled. 6 Sellars argues that the Scientific Image should be given priority when confronted with the Manifest Image. I argue against this in my (1996). 7 I take common sense to be an amalgamation of various widely shared useful empirical beliefs, practical wisdom, a priori intuitions, and physical intuitions. 8 I use "form of life" and "manifest image" interchangeably; for an elaboration of my concept of "form of life" see van Brakel (1994a). The manifest image in my sense should not be associated with the "basic level" in the sense of Rosch and Lakoff ? cf. van Brakel (1991a). 9 For overviews of the relation of reduction to supervenience and emergence see Agazzi (1991), Beckemmann et al. (1992), Charles and Lennon (1992), Horgan (1993); for "deter mination" see Hellman and Thompson (1975) and Macdonald (1989). 10 It has been suggested that one difference is that reduction is essentially a linguistic relation, whereas supervenience is usually defined as a relation between properties (von Kutschera 1992). However there are also writers who take supervenience to be a relation between predicates of a language. 11 I will take either way of phrasing this problem as the same conceptual problem. Hence I disagree with, for example, Armstrong ( 1989:104) when he says that a supervenience thesis "might be said to be ontologically reductionist, without being semantically reductionist." I believe that the distinction appealed to cannot be upheld. I take the view (not argued for here) that it is not merely how objects (individuals) are classified, but also which individuals there are, is relative to the discourse (level of description, theory, conceptual scheme, or whatever) that is used to cope with them. Which individuals there are is relative to the language used to discuss the world; the world does not come to us presorted (Carnap 1956; van Brakel 1996). "The very terms 'thing' and 'exist' and 'real', after all, make no sense apart from human conceptualization" (Quine 1993). This is one way in which the Scientific Image depends on the manifest image for its basic intuitions (cf. Section 8). For further arguments see Goodman (1978, 1984), Putnam (1987,1988,1990). For counter arguments against the suggestion that this view is relativism or would take away the objectivity of objects see Putnam (1981,1987) and van Brakel (1992a, 1994a). 12 D. Lewis (1983: 358): "A supervenience thesis is ... a stripped down form of reduc tionism, unencumbered by dubious denials of existence, claims of ontological priority, or claims of translatability". Post (1987: 169): "physicalists can cheerfully concede that there may be more things in heaven and earth than the mathematical-physical vocabulary can say, although there are no more things than are dreamt of in their Inventory Principle" (emphasis added). 13 No doubt the most common way of thinking about, say, mental states being dependent on brain states is to assume that brain states cause mental states (von Kutschera 1992; Searle 1992: 125), but I suggest Davidson's proposal outlined in the text is to be preferred to get round the dilemma of most (or all) events being either causally overdetermined or epiphenomenal (van Brakel forthcoming). 14 Including the variant in which the 5-properties are divided into secondary and primary properties (Papineau 1993, Kim 1995). 15 Hence, I pass over most of the recent literature on mental causation and the suggestion</page><page sequence="31">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 283 that there might be different kinds of causation (Crane 1995; Heil and Mele 1993; Lowe 1993). 16 To emphasise that substantial and scientifically relevant issues are involved consider the following example from the discussion between Mausfeld et al. (1992) and Thompson et al. (1992: 56) about interdiscourse relations in connection with colour. In their target article Thompson et al. had presented the following "multilevel description": The phenomenal colour space (appearance as specified in terms of hue, saturation, and brightness) overlays the "psychophysical channel [sic!] space", which overlays the "physiological channels [sic!] space", which overlays the " 'lightness' indicator space", which overlays the "recep tor space: the raw array of local activity under given illumination conditions in a scene". Thompson et al. are, I think correctly, criticised by several commentators for their sugges tion that the idea of a phenomenal colour space is a clear notion. Mausfeld et al. (1992) write: Thompson et al. place phenomenal color space at the top of a hierarchy of color spaces ... The concept of level involved here remains ambiguous, if not obscure, all the more so as - ironically enough- human phenomenal color space is identified with the color space as defined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CE) and the corresponding tristimulus values ... These are actually based on color-matching experiments ... that have for practical reasons been chosen from a family of linearly-related color codes, among which are those ... that are commonly interpreted as receptor-level ones. Thus, at the top of the hierarchy we find ourselves back at level (i), as it were. In reply Thompson et al. say that "[t]he multilevel analysis we advocate is misconstrued by Mausfeld et al.... we have proposed only various levels of analysis that need stand in no (noninterest-relative) hierarchy and that together constitute a color space with various attributes". Hence, Thompson et al. argue for an "equal" heterarchical representation of all levels within their interactional or ecological concept of colour, thus offering an alternative to the dominant hierarchical view implied in the ordinary use of "level", "to supervene", and "to underlie". As their article shows, a fundamentally different approach to the nature of the relation between different levels of analysis can have profound consequences for the direction of applied research in the behavioural and brain sciences. 17 Definitions of mereological supervenience vary. Compare (emphasis added): "one event depends on another in virtue o/the fact that the base event involves physical objects which are constituents o/the physical object of the higher-level event" (Menzies 1988) and Grimes (1988): "macroscopical objects, though not constituted by microphysical objects, super vene on these objects". (See also Kim 1984a, 1988; Armstrong 1989: 112.) 18 Mumford (1994) has argued that there is no asymmetry in the co-determination of dis positional and categorical properties. This is a problem quite apart from the point that how things do what they do might be explained in terms of its microparts, but not what it does. 19 Dupr? (1993: 122): "the genes described structurally by the molecular geneticist are not the same things as those referred to in the models of population genetics or even of classical transmission genetics". 20 For macro-micro in the social sciences in terms of supervenience see Campbell (1990); Kincaid (1986, 1988, 1990); Tuomela (1989, 1990); for economic examples see Owens (1992: 121-124), P?trie (1987). 21 See the writings of Dewey, Gibson, Mead, Vygotsky, and Wittgenstein for different terminologies. 22 Post also says (1987: 159): "the rough idea of physicalism ... is that only the basic entities and processes of mathematical physics exist, plus their complex combinations..."</page><page sequence="32">284 J. VAN BRAKEL I'll pass over the problem of how physicalism is to fit in mathematics, the latter presumably being somehow involved at the most basic level. 23 Paraphrasing Hellman and Thompson (1975): fixing the extensions of physical terms fixes the extensions of all terms; if supervenience is true then physics is entitled to occupy the ground floor in the scientific hierarchy. Cf. Kim (1989, 1993: xv); D. Lewis (1983: 361); Owens (1989,1992); Poland (1994: 7); Post (1987: 16f). 24 These intuitions have been expressed in many different and usually vague but suggestive ways. Compare: "supervenience claims are popular at least partly because they offer some of the metaphysical relief of reductions, without incurring the costs" (Blackburn 1985: 52); supervenience reconciles "the apparently conflicting but reasonable claims of determina tion and conceptual autonomy" (Hellman 1985); "the supervenient properties are in some substantive sense dependent on, or determined by, their subvenient properties and yet, it is hoped, irreducible to them" (Kim 1989); "When early efforts to reduce or analyze away the moral, the mental, or the macrophysical in favor of some more 'genuine' type of reality repeatedly failed, supervenience was there to assist in the rescue" (Grimes 1988); "a happy medium between dualism and reductionism" (Bacon 1986). On the other hand: "invoking a special primitive metaphysical relation of supervenience... was just to add mystery to mystery, to cover one obscurantist move with another" (Schiffer 1987: 154). 25 Recently Kim (1993: 165) has suggested "questions of reducibility are best left out of the concept of supervenience". Jack (1994) argues that supervenience doesn't clarify materialism and doesn't imply it, even if combined with the claim that every particular is physical. 26 See for discussions of this issue for example Meehl and Sellars (1956); Papineau (1990); Crane (1991). As Crane and Mellor (1990) point out, it has to be explained what physics is, because materialism has been refuted by physics. Furthermore, in practice reduction is neither feasible nor to the point and in principle it appeals to principles like unity of science or microreduction, which modern physics itself seems to deny. 27 Kim has suggested that all three definitions can be formulated either in terms of indis cernibility or in terms of similarity. He has shown that [SS] entails both [WS] and [GS]; [WS] entails neither of the other and similarly for [GS]. But Horgan (1982) and Bacon (1986) argue that [WS] and [SS] are equivalent and, by appealing to "mixed worlds", Black burn (1985) makes a plausible case for the arbitrariness of distinguishing [WS] and [SS]. See on the relations between the three definitions also P?trie (1987) and Grimes (1991) and for alternative classifications, sorting out the modal operators, see also Blackburn (1985); Macdonald(1989); McFetridge(1985); Seager (1991b); Yasenchuk( 1995). 28 [WS] "fails to capture the sense in which supervenient properties are supposed to be dependent upon, rather than systematically correlated with, their subvenient properties" (Grimes 1988). 29 Kim (1989): "If a predicate of the theory being reduced has a nomologically coextensive predicate in the reducing theory, the universally quantified biconditional connecting the two predicates will be available for use as a bridge law". 30 This has been disputed by others (Heil 1992; Hellman 1992; Marras 1993). 31 For defences of global supervenience see Post (1987: 200-203; 1994), Hellman and Thompson (1975), Horgan (1982), Pauli and Sider (1992). Also D. Lewis' Humean super venience is a case of global supervenience. 32 If interdiscourse relations are defined globally they are too coarse, because it allows, say, that relocating one hydrogen atom to some other place in the universe could make the difference between a world containing or not containing mental events (Kim 1987; P?trie 1987).</page><page sequence="33">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 285 33 According to Melnyk (1991) supervenience reduces to eliminativism. 34 Menzies (1988) is correct to note that "[i]n spite of the fact that the notion of event supervenience is usually invoked as an irreflexive and asymmetric relation, neither Kim's definition, nor other definitions to be found in the literature, bear these features out". See also DePaul (1987) for arguments that what we want in the moral case is a relation of dependence that is asymmetrical and exclusive- which definitions of supervenience do not provide. To solve this problem Menzies (1988) discards the idea of a unitary conception of supervenience and proposes a definition which meets the criteria of being irreflexive and asymmetrical; it allows for multiple realisation; and has the feature of determination. However, the definition implies that four types of supervenience are needed; moreover the feature of determination is conditional on certain other conditions being satisfied. 35 For example Kim (1990: 16) says: "Property covariation per se is metaphysically neutral; dependence, and other such relations [like supervenience], suggest ontological and explanatory directionality - that upon which something depends is ontologically and explanatorily prior to, and more basic than, that which depends on it". 36 In [S2] a property can be any conceivable, or even inconceivable, property. That is to say, as defined, the interdiscourse relation is not restricted to natural, relevant or projectable properties. To have a property is simply to be a member of a class: "Any class of things, be it ever so gerrymandered and miscellaneous and indescribable in thought and language, and be it ever so superfluous in characterising the world, is nevertheless a property" (D. Lewis 1983: 346). 37 More formally this is the question of the closure conditions that are allowed in the base discourse. Kim (1984a) has suggested that supervenience is a relation between families of properties where &amp; family is defined as the boolean closure of some "seed" set of proper ties. But this allows for "wildly disjunctive Kim-laws" (Seager 1991a) and it is doubtful whether "negations of physical predicates always correspond to physical properties" (Hell man 1985: 609); but see Heil (1992: 75) for disagreement. It is clear that too many closure assumptions trivialise interdiscourse relations, because then "everything strongly super venes on everything" (Van Cleve 1990). I pass over the technical discussions of "natural" and "unnatural" closure conditions (Oddie and Tichy 1990; Van Cleve 1990; Bacon 1986; Seager 1988,1991b; Oddie 1991; Post 1987: 178; Owens 1989; Teller 1984, 1985;Currie 1990; Kim 1984a). 38 As Hellman (1985) puts it: "This saves us from worrying about just how much of the environment of a system needs to be considered in order to determine the higher-level predicates. And it proves advantageous when we come to quantum mechanics with its perplexing holistic entanglements". More specifically, global supervenience bypasses such questions as to whether mental life or moral properties are to some extent dependent on extrinsic, contextual properties (having "wide" as opposed to "narrow" content). 39 See for example Blackburn (1985: 51), who, in response, assumes a limitation thesis. However it is unclear which criteria would be used to separate out the locally relevant parts of the environment, as Wright (1985) points out, reviewing Blackburn (1984). 40 Bonevac (1991) stresses that we should distinguish two types of supervenience that correspond with property and object autonomy respectively. But I would emphasise that unwarranted assumptions are introduced if it is taken for granted that a sharp context-free separation can be made between object-kinds and property-kinds (van Brakel 1996). 41 See for the re-surfacing of literature on "emergence" Beckermann (1992); Campbell (1990); Casta?eda (1990): Kim (1992b); Senchuk(1991). 42 See, for example, Garfinkel (1981:49-74), and, more recently, Owens (1989), and Nean der and Menzies (1990) for discussions of the explanatory pervasion thesis according to</page><page sequence="34">286 J. VAN BRAKEL which the special sciences, by abstracting from the differences in the physical realisations of their subject phenomena, capture interesting generalisations which do not correspond to any physical generalisations. 43 Usually the necessity of the supervenience relation is taken to be of a strong kind. However, my concern is merely with this world. Hence the argument that even if there are no identical objects in this world, there will be in other worlds I consider irrelevant. The point that if there are no duplicates, supervenience is vacuous, is of course trivial: "In the extreme case in which (in all the relevant 'worlds') no two objects of a specifiable sort are F -indiscernible, any G whatever (restricted to that sort) weakly supervenes vacuously on i*1" (Hellman 1985). "So absolutely every characteristic of myself is going to supervene upon my exact place and date of birth" (Wright 1985); "if... it is a truism that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects, the truth of monism is a truism (Davidson 1985: 244). 44 D. Lewis (1983: 355) gives as an example the output of a "perfect" photocopying machine: "Copy and original would be alike in size and shape and chemical composition of the ink marks and the paper, alike in temperature and magnetic alignment and electro static charge, alike even in the exact arrangement of their electrons and quarks". But it's unclear what this means, because the arrangement of electrons and quarks is [i] constantly changing, and [ii] not well-determined while not being measured. 45 See van Brakel (1986). A similar point has been used by Miller (1990) to argue that supervenience always works in two directions; for example, it is not only the case that the moral supervenes on the physical; also the physical supervenes on the moral. (Miller's argument has been disputed by Heil (1992: 90-95) and Hellman (1992).) Would it help to loosen the identity requirement by talking about "similar" or "roughly identical" S properties overlaying "roughly identical" B-properties? No, not in general; what is roughly similar and what is not depends on the context and interest at hand. 46 Horgan (1993) has proposed that "bare supervenience" is not enough. What is needed is superdupervenience, "ontological supervenience that is robustly explainable in a materi alistically acceptable way", but already that terminology suggests this will simply lead to the addition of more epicycles. 47 "Over the past decade, genetic linkage analysis, in which researchers look for DNA markers that are consistently inherited along with the disease, has turned up at least half a dozen "hot spots" ? areas of the genome that appear to harbor a candidate gene. None of these tentative sightings has held up, however" (Editorial Science, 12 May 1995). Con cordance rates for monozygotic twins seem to be lower in the case of more representative samples and better diagnostic efforts. Although the evidence of some genetic contribution seems indisputable (and trivial), this doesn't exclude a strong and independent role of the environment in pathogenesis (Reiss, Plomin and Hetherington 1991). 48 I pass over the problems for neo-Darwinism raised by dynamic development theory, according to which genetic and brain stages are subject to continuing alteration in interac tion with the environment, so that genes play no privileged role in development (Oyama 1985; Griffiths and Gray 1994). I also pass over that the cause of schizophrenia selects a cause out of an indeterminate causal nexus of causal processes "surrounding" it and that the choice of the relevant cause is a normative issue. 49 "We do not really know what boundaries should be used to define this group of disorders ... If we ignore or forget the broad history of their concepts, we shall limit our efforts of studying only 'DSM-III' (or -III-R or -IV) schizophrenia ... We shall be lulled into the false belief that we know more than we actually do. We shall be embracing the Ahistorical</page><page sequence="35">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 287 Fallacy and all its faulty assumptions" (Editorial American Journal of Psychiatry, 151, 1994, 1406). 50 This point is often made in the qualia discussion and undermines the idea of giving strict indiscernibility criteria. See for example Putnam (1981:75?102) for the problem of drawing the boundaries of physical categories upon which qualia supervene and Post (1987: 196), who gives a general argument against "universal physical individuatability". The problem is not restricted to colour and others things overlaying brain events, but applies equally to identifying the microscopic events that correspond to a water wave in a swimming pool hitting a floating cork (Haugeland 1982) or to identifying macroscopic genes in terms of DNA sequences (Dupr? 1993; Kincaid 1987; Fogle 1990). 51 The same sort of reasoning applies to the colour perception of animals. Colour categories are always anthropomorphic, if not ethnocentric (van Brakel 1992e). 52 By "atomic" I mean, roughly, the sense in which, in English, pink is not atomic in that it can be seen or at least conceptualised as a mixture of white and red. 53 See Corbett and Morgan (1988); Hill (1972); Morgan and Corbett (1989); Moss et al. (1991). 54 The account I give is in conflict with the theories of Rosch (Rosch Heider 1971, 1972a, 1972b, 1973; Rosch Heider and Olivier 1972;Rosch 1974), Bornstein, Kessen and Weiskopf (1976), and Berlin and Kay (Berlin and Kay 1969; Kay and McDaniel 1978; Kay et al. 1991). For many sustained arguments against the theories of Rosch and Berlin and Kay see Saunders (1992,1993,1995), Saunders and van Brakel (1988,1995,1996); van Brakel (1991a, 1992c, 1993a, 1994b). 55 Related views can be found in the writings of various kinds of pragmatists (although they may sometimes call themselves empiricists; see van Brakel (1996) for the relation between empiricism and pragmatism). Recent examples include Dupr? (1993); Goodman (1978, 1984); Price (1992); Putnam (1987,1990, 1994); van Fraassen (1986, 1992,1995). 56 Here "entrenched" refers to the views of Goodman (1978,1984). I use the plural "mani fest images" to account for both the inter- and the intra-cultural variation in manifest images and forms of life (van Brakel 1994a). 57 Compare, surprisingly, Kim (1993: ix): "I am now inclined to think that ontological schemes are by and large optional, and that the main considerations that should govern the choice of an ontology are those of utility, simplicity, elegance, and the like". 58 I take it that these two statements need no further argument, as most current literature in the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mind would endorse them. For detailed arguments, including the history of these failed research programmes, see in particular Putnam (1981,1988). Consider also: "discourse no longer appears as one plane parallel to another, but as a tangle of intersecting dimensions whose relations with one another and with extralinguistic fact conform to no simple pattern" (Sellars 1963: 301). The vision of nature as governed by a system of laws (as distinct form individual laws) comes from prac tical, not theoretical reason (Putnam 1995:42). To favour a comprehensive ontology which fits well with science and resolves more philosophical puzzles than any known competitor is a value judgement (van Fraassen 1995). 59 Compare Price's (1992) defence that what he calls metaphysical pluralism is the default position. To defend something else either a substantial distinction has to be made between factual and nonfactual uses of language or it has to be shown that the unity of factual discourse is more than skin deep. Such defences without exception make an appeal to common sense. 60 See on the problem of identifying the physical and the self-applicability of physical principles Crane and Mellor (1991); Poland (1994).</page><page sequence="36">288 J. VAN BRAKEL 61 Philosophers of biology tend to agree that at best biology supervenes on chemistry and physics, but is not reducible. Chemistry cannot be reduced to physics (Bunge 1982; Levy 1979; Primas 1983, 1985; Scerri 1991, 1993). For detailed arguments that it is not at all clear how the reduction of temperature would work without making a priori assumptions that appeal to microphysical terminology see Kuipers (1982); Primas (1985). Cartwright (1983, 1994) has given extensive arguments against reduction of real-world situations to the highly contrived environments of physical laboratories. Given all this it is not very clear what Kim (1993: 26) means when he asks the rhetorical question: "If psychology is reducible by the same standards that apply to the best cases of theory reduction in the sci ences (...), why isn't that reduction enough?" The class of "best cases of theory reduction in the sciences" is empty. 62 For various types of argument against the "strictness" of physical laws and the pragmatic considerations invoked in applying laws see Cartwright (1983, 1994); Crane and Mel lor (1991); Dupr? (1993: 159-167); Klee (1992); Hempel (1988); Lange (1993); Putnam (1987: 11,37); Scheibe (1991); van Brakel (1986); van Fraassen (1989,1992); Van Gulick (1992). In denying the existence of strict laws I don't mean to favour replacing them with capacities as the true necessary structurings of the world. I sympathise with Cartwright's critics when they argue that capacities too don't escape the problem of context dependency (Morrison 1995). 63 See Dupr? (1993); Khalidi (1993); van Brakel (1986, 1992a). 64 See Putnam (1992: 40); Sellars (1963); Van Fraassen (1993). Also note that many phys ical laws are not laws of cause and effect (force relations, energy exchange relations,... ). 65 The Principle is: "Kinds in science are individuated on the basis of causal powers; that is, objects and events fall under a kind, or share a property, insofar as they have similar causal powers". For a criticism of this principle see Post (1994). Worries about "overlapping" natural kinds or "causal overdetermination" are unjustified. The idea that "there can be no more than one 'complete' and 'independent' explanation for any single explanandum" (Kim 1993: xiii; 1989: 44) is incoherent, because there are no such things as "complete" and/or "independent" explanations, except, perhaps, if the single explanandum is the uni verse (and its history). 66 About logical truths Quine (1976: 111) says that they are "obvious (whatever this really means)" and he stresses that there is no defining essence of what logic is. In justifying our deductive methods of inference, we have to use the very methods of deductive inference that we are attempting to justify: "Our problem is not to persuade anyone, not even our selves, to employ deductive arguments: it is to find a satisfactory explanation of the role of such arguments in our use of language" (Dummett 1978: 296). Concerning a discussion between logicians about which calculus to choose, Carnap (1963: 873) says: "it is merely a practical difference in preferences and decisions concerning the acceptance of languages". On a pragmatic view "even topic-neutral truths [like the truths of deductive logic] emerge from experience, or, better, from practice (including reflection on that practice), and belong to conceptual schemes which have to show their ability to function in practice (which does not mean that they are "empirical"). In the same way ... there are topic-neutral norms; but they too emerge from practice and have to show their ability to function in practice, as do all norms and values" (Putnam 1994: 161). 67 For example, Shapiro (1993) says, in a discussion of various approachesin the philosophy of mathematics: "The proponents claim that [their primitive] terminology is already to be found in ordinary language, the informal framework in which we actually do philosophical, logical, and meta-mathematical work".</page><page sequence="37">PRIMACY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE 289 68 Hence: "we have this beautiful mathematics, and we don't know which part of the world it should be applied to (Bell, in Bornstein 1991: 52). 69 The boundary conditions are not derivable from the lower level laws of physics and chemistry as every applied scientist knows (Polanyi 1958). Applying laws to concrete cases always requires an appeal to initial and boundary conditions. Because to fix these requires measurement, prediction (or retrodiction) is never strict, even before we enter the realm of quantum mechanics or quantum field theory (Feinberg, Lavine and Albert 1992; Wilson 1990). 70 Of course, in the twentieth century, the manifest and Scientific Image cannot be neat ly separated. The manifest image is constantly modified under the impact of scientific developments. I do not deny that the Scientific Image (among other theoretical images) influences the manifest image, but that doesn't take away the priority of the latter. It is not a matter of adjudicating whether we should grant priority to the one or to the other. There is no choice but to start from the world of daily life. 71 Similarly my defence of the priority of the manifest image does not eliminate the rel ative autonomy of science (or the relative autonomy of art for that matter). The manifest image provides the foundations for the explanatory framework of science. It doesn't follow, however, that everything scientific can or should be definable within the manifest image. Categories in the Scientific Image are dependent on and constrained by the manifest image in terms of their relevance and the most general criteria that govern scientific practice, but the theories of science are not determined or fixed by the manifest image (just as art works are not determined or fixed by the manifest image).
