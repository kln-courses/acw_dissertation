<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. A New Interpretation of Ilerbart's Psychology and Educational Theory through the Philosophy of Leibniz. By JOHN DAVIDSON, M.A., D.Phil. Edinburgh: William Blaekwood &amp; Sons, pp. xviii, 191. THE trouble with 'interpretations' is, that so frequently they lead the reader away from the original author, Dr. Davidson's book, however, is an exception. It would indeed hardly be intelligible unless the reader already was acquainted with Herbart's writings. The difficulties in Herbart himself are great, and probably all readers would wish that he had written in a style at once more attractive and more lucid. But he has to be taken as he is, on pain of accepting something perhaps better, perhaps worse, but different from Herbart. Frankly, we admit, it is easier to read Dr. Davidson than Herbart. Our interpreter has the great merit of clearness. We can almost always, at first reading, tell what he means. He hits the bull's-eye often, like a trained marksman, and now and again we find ourselves counting up his scores, which we realise are very high. We get a philosophy of education, and a very interesting one. We go back to Socrates who argued that virtue can be taught; that the ignor- ant man cannot be truly virtuous; and that knowledge is virtue. We recognise that Herbart taught the same doctrine, and put it into peda- gogic form. But gebting into closer qu-arters with speculative questions, Dr. Davidson's thesis is that Leibniz is a better starting-point for the interpretation of Herbart than is Kant. Accordingly, the philosophical theory of Leibniz is expounded, and expounded with great clearness. So clear and interesting is the exposition that we are led to wonder how Leibniz would himself have developed an educational theory and method from his philosophical principles. But Dr. Davidson is satis,ied with lshowing that for Leibniz there is 'no ego existing apart from that which is to become a fact to it'. The ego and its contents are one and in- divisible in remlity, whatever they may be for purposes of analysis. The mind is a monad, whose life consists in 'appetition,' and 'perception,' and the object of perception is the universe implicitly implied con- tained within the monad's own life. This representation of this universe at first takes place in a very confused manner. Such confused mode of perception by the monad is what is known as external matter. Inter- action between one monad and another is only seemingly real and is- produced by pre-established harmony. From such a system of thought, Leibniz naturally holds that 'subject' and ' object 'are inseparables, without meaning if taken independently. Dr. Davidson attempts to show that on Leibniz's principles the interaction between one monad and others may be real and not merely one which requires a theory of pre-established'harmony for its interpretation. Leib- niz's theory of feeling and will is founded on his theory of knowledge. There is a similar relation in Herbart. Dr. Davidson contends that</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 115 the Herbartian 'soul' is substantially the Leibnizian 'monad '. Given the metaphysical ground-work of Leibniz's and Herbart's theories as the same, the psychological up-build of presentation, feeling, desire and will are shown by Dr. Davidson to be interpretable on similar lines. The later chapters of Dr. Davidson's book contain a valuahle exposi- tion of Herbart's views of the concept of interest, and its implication. He also makes the occasion for a deduction from the Herbartian psy- chology of the fallacy of formal education and treats of the relation between individuality anid many-sided interest. It is often said that Education is independent of all metaphysical theories. We are inclined to think that the study of such a book as this of Dr. Davidson, will show that this position cannot be sustained. Whether the 'soul' is an entity which, so to say, deals with its presenta- tions and moulds them into a unity of purpose of its own, or whether the soul simply emerges into consciousness by the inter-play of presenta- tions, is built up of thenm, and is itself, so to speak, the mosaic formed into a pattern by the relationships established by the presentations amongst each other, will bring the educational question: Are we to attempt to develop the soul by presentations, or from presentations to develop a soul ? Does self-activity mean the same thing as "many- sided initerest " ? Dr. Davidson is quite clear that Herbart affords a better resting-place in metaphysics than does Hegel for the theory of Education. His last chapter is entitled " Interest v rs as Self-realisation as the First Prin- ciple of Education ". He does not seeni to be willing to admit that these two principles may be from an educational point of view complementary. He insists on regarding them as alternative. Against the theory of self- realisation as the educational end Dr. Davidson urges that the " self" can be as completely realised along the line of vice as along that of virtue. But surely precisely the same criticism applies to 'interest'. What guarantee is there that 'interest ' qua interest secures the 'right' sort of ' interest' ? It is objected against ' self-realisation ' that it has 'no definite connotation and affords no guidance for educational practice,' whilst ' interest ' implicitly contains a whole educational theory whose fundamental postulate is that very self-activity whose absence the Herbartian critic so much deplores ! Yet Herbart himself declared that the application of the test of a teacher's success with a pupil must be deferred for thirty years, half a lifetime, before it can be decided whether the education given was such that the educand perceives from later experience and self-investigation, really suited and promioted his development. The fact is that the term 'interest' is ambiguous; it describes a process, and it also is used by Herbartians tow indicate an 'end' of life-the creation and development of right 'interests '. So far from accepting Dr. Davidson's view of the definite connotation of interest, it is a question whether Education does not suffer as much from the use of the term as Economics suffers from the popular terms 'wages,' 'profit,' 'rent'. Dr. Davidson, again, trenchantly urges against 'self-realisation' as an educational aim: "The obtrusion of the ' self ' in the expression of a working base principle of ethical life is only too apt to be self-defeating, as leading the individual falsely to identify the direct interest in self with the moral life. What is wanted in national, social and individual life is an outlook away from the self-a Herbartian interest, which is an interest in anything but the self." But Rosenkranz has dealt with this very point, and shown that self-activity as an educational process must be developed by self-estrangement. Dr. Davidson considers 'self-realisation ' an inferior ethical end to the</page><page sequence="3">116 NEW BOOKS. Buddhist Law of Righteousness which enjoins oi men the duty of de- stroying the illusion of self-hood. Ignorance, as Herbartians and the best Buddhists declare, is "the source of all moral wrong ". But let us remember it is ignorance which makes the ignorant a flock of 'sheep; it is knowledge, or let us rather say, wisdom, which makes them individuals. And Dr. Davidson recognises the development of individuality as an educational principle as readily as a Hegelian. Sufficient, however, has now been said to show that Metaphysics plays an important part in the discussion of the place of the educational theory of Herbart, however much educationists insist on the educational in- dependence of Herbart's contribution to practice from his theory. Dr. Davidson deserves recognition for his attempt to face the prob- lem in connexion with Herbart, and his adverse criticism of the Hegelian standpoint will* stimulate discussion and promote thought amongst educationists. One of Dr. Davidson's views certainly should be brought out into the open for discussion. He holds a very high opinion of the function of the State in connexion with Education. The State, apparently, is to regulate the " differentiation of the education suitable for different individuals and communities in the State ". The individual must be encouraged " to travel along the lines of interest already known to him in so far as these tend in the right direction ". Dr. Davidson chooses as an instance the town-child and the country-child. Each, apparently, should be de- veloped along the lines of his own town or country interests. This seems to us, we confess, perilously near to the suggestion that all ""bents " of nature and condition should be steadily cultivated. On this point Herbart himself has, told us that such procedure is like the wish to exaggerate the humped-backness of' an individual, who is already thus marked, and certainly if it does not militate against 'many-sidedness' of interest, Dr. Davidson here is not in close keeping with the ideal of all- roundness. The interference of the State, quite apart from any abstract laissez-faire objection, does not seem to be likely to perform much for the good of the individual, in determining his surroundings, or process of education, whilst in the State schools the number of children entrusted to one teacher is so large, nor can one imagine Local Authorities likely to determine questions of local environment in the education of each individual child, with due absence of prejudices and preconceptions. Dr. Davidson's later chapters leave Leibniz behind, or if they take him with them, do so by transfusion into modern thought by a method which would almost, if not entirely, have enabled Dr. Davidson to have brought Kant of Hegel into a similar position. But Dr. Davidson is -greater than his particular thesis. He has brought a well-stored mind, an acute judgment, and an unusually lucid power of exposition, illustra- tion and teaching into his pages. He is a teacher of, as well as thinker on, educational science (or if you prefer, speculation), and there are few recent writers on educational philosophy of greater clearness. FOSTER WATSON. An Introduction to Philosophy. By GEORGcE STUART FULLARTON, Pro- fessor of Philosophy in Columbia University. The Macmillan Company, 1906. Pp. xiii, 322. Some professors in America follow a plan common in Germany, but very rarely practised, I believe, in England, of printing an outline of Lecture-courses, something between a syllabus and a manual, in order to give a bird's-eye view of the subject and to facilitate the compre- hension of every part by being' able to refer it to the total scheme.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 117 Such a work is Prof. Fullarton's Introduction to Philosophy, and it seems to be well suited to its purpose. Whether that purpose is a good one must depend upon whether a course of lectures is to be little more than another book with extensive footnotes, or whether it is to be a free com- munication of ideas, personal and dramatic. The only excuse for giving a lecture,EI should say, is to make it something as different as possible from the reading of a book. But there is another use for such an Introduction as the one before me: it might be put into a student's hands whilst he was still doubting whether, or not, Philosophy should be his pursuit, or his principal pur- suit. Here, one might say to buoyant youth, here is a map of the road. Observe the Slough of Despond, the Hill of Difficulty, how the path swerves wide of that agreeable city, Vanity Fair; Doubting Castle is conspicuous from every point of view; and at the end of the journey shines New Jerusalem, depending for its population upon the arrival of successful pilgrims, and still uninhabited. Buoyant youth might then take the road, or not, at his own discretion, knowing the worst; and if he would go, his blood would be upon his own head. 'Knowing the worst'? Why, no: that would be very unfair to Prof. Fullarton's good sense and lucidity. Still, in his agreeable way, he shows the student over the whole field of thought, discussing the out- lines of the history of philosophy, the problems of the external world and of the mind, some types of philosophical theory, the relations of the philosophical sciences, the utility of philosophy and the spirit in which it ought to be studied. He gives everywhere references for further reading; but in the chapters dealing with the external world and the mind, he follows especially his own System of Metaphysics, reviewed in MIND, N.S., 58. The whole is written with so much reasonableness and moderation that, I should think, many other teachers whose method required such a book, would find it useful, even if they did not entirely agree with the author's opinions. The only staxtling doctrine that I have met with in the book occurs in ? 38. Having already shown that mental phenomena cannot occupy space, he here argues thatl "no series of mental changes can occupy any portion of time, real time, or even fill a single moment in the stream of time ". Real time is the schema of physical processes, or causation, in which mental phenomena have no place. A sensation, strictly speaking, is not in time at all; real duration can only be predicated of the physical concomitant. The word 'real' is important; for a sermon or a dream may have apparent duration, may seem long, though whether they really are so can only be measured by the clock or some physical standard. This doctrine, then, is exactly contrary to the ordinary derivation of time from subjeciQive experience of change. For my part, I have always viewed the common doctrine with suspicion, because subjective changes want the definiteness and regularity that characterise time; but it is anothei thing to exclude them from time altogether. If not in time, how can they be concomitant with physical processes ? As to the illusoriness of subjective time, nothing is fuller of illusions than the perception of space. But, to the best of my judgment (though I hardly like to trust it in this case), what has misled Prof. Fullarton is the word ' occupy,' which is properly applicable only to space. Space may at a certain point be occupied by one body to the exclusion of all others; But there is no mutual exclusion amongst the changes that occur in time. Time is never 'occupied'. One reason why mental phenomena have no true spatial character is that they have no power of excluding bodies. But in time, mental changes and physical changes are all non- exclusive of one another in just the same way. It is true that subjective</page><page sequence="5">118 NEW BOOKS. processes are usually less definitely measurable than physical changes; but then physical changes are known by observations that are infected by subjective error, and have to be averaged and corrected. If, then, we deny real time of thought, we must also deny it of perception; and ' time' will become a name for abstract regularity, which is not charac- teristic of any actual experience, and which no actual experience can be said to be ' in' or to occupy. Restraining the impulse to comment upon everything, I may say that amongst the later chapters of the book the thinnest is the one on Logic; but, then, the subject is thin. In the chapter on Metaphysics the conclusion is that epistemology cannot be separated from Metaphysics and made a separate discipline; and this seems to me to be true. The practical admonitions that conclude the volume may be taken to heart not by students only: "Be prepared to enter upon a new way of looking at things"; "Remember that ordinary rules of evidence apply ". CJ. R. Sociological Papers. Vol. iii. By G. ARCEDALL REID, W. M'DoUGALL, J. L. TAYLER, J. ARTHUR THOMSOw, PATRICK GEDDES, A. E. .CRAWLEY, R. M. WENLEY, W. H. BEVERIDGE, G. DE WESSELITSKY, Mrs. SIDNEY WEBB and H. G. WELLS. Published for the Socio- logical Society. London: Macmillan &amp; Co. Pp. xi, 382. The unity formed by the papers in this volume is somewhat obscure, but in the nature of the case it must be so. ' Sociology' is not the name of a science, but is a term embracing a variety of studies on different planes, all of which have some social reference. Some link on to natural sciences, others are philosophical, others again economic, plolitical or historical. Four of the papers now published by the Socio- logical Society are chiefly or largely biological. Dr. Archdall Reid deals with problems of heredity and variability. Dr. Tayler expounds the theory that sociology is founded on 'Individuology,' i.e., that the characteristics of individuals are ultimately responsible for social for- mations. In Professor J. A. Thomson's contribution stress is laid upon the social inferences which may be drawn from biological teaching in its application to the human race. Mr. M'Dougall, also startingf from the biological approach, makes a practical eugenic suggestion. Shortly expressed, it is that the children of the educated middle.class who have succeeded should be paid for. The proposal is put forward primarily with reference to the Civil Service and the academic profession. In these callings are to be found first-class selections from the University men in the Uifited Kingdom. It is pioposed that salaries should rise with marriage, and then according to the size of families, as well as by seniority and proved capacity; and the hope is expressed that the 'reform' would spread. Except where the intention of the service is to buy the whole of a man's life, in which case provision for salaries to rise with marriage and the size of the family at the expense of bachelors could be regarded as of the nature of insurance against the eventualities of life, like pension schemes, the suggestion lays the axe, to the root principle of remuneration in society as at present constituted, i.e., that pay,ment should be made in proportion to value of work done. Mr. M'Dougall no doubt would argue that. rearingf a family of a particular quality is valuable work done for society which ought to be paid for. But in spite of the persuasiveness' of Mr. M'Dougall's advocacy one is beset with doubts. Is it clear that the native qualities of these families would ordinarily be above the average ? The answer that biology teaches</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 119 this would not be correct. It is a conclusion founded upon moderately well-established doctrines of biology and certain social inferences. It is upon the latter that I am most inclined to cast doubt. If the child. inherits a type and not the acquired characteristics of the parents, it has yet to be proved that the University man should be encouraged in the interests of society to have more children. Many of the successful University men, indeed, have come from the poorer classes, and many more might have come from them under a more internally mobile social system. Assuming that a special type succeeds in this way, and that more of such people so trained are needed, it would prima facie seem to be wiser to aid more of that type to enter their kingdom than to tempt those already discovered to be more prolific. Why artificially upset the balance of types before it is at all accurately known what the balance is ! Moreover, no rule governs the selection of the mothers. And is the plan practicable ? Imagine the situation created under present con- ditions, according to which each University in the United Kingdom is left free to manage its own finances, by the application for a University chair of two equally suitable men, one of whom was a bachelor and the other a married man with many children. Again one can foresee politico-social difficulties. Even if there be well-marked types, we do not want them to become castes or to be thought of as castes. The rest of the volume consists of a sketchy paper on the origin of religion, by Mr. A. E. Crawley; a chapter in Russian Political History, with its centre of gravity in existing movements, under the title The Russian Revolution, by Mr. Wesselitsky; a plea by Professor Geddes for the establishment of Civic Museums, in which he reveals again his well- known faith in collection; tabulation and arrangement, as a means of discovering the laws of nature; sound, practical advice on methods of investigation in economics and political science, by Mrs. Webb; a com- mendable piece of economic analysis, followed by. sane, practical pro- posals, on the question of the unemployed, by Mr. Beveridge, in the discussion of which Mr. Hobson advanced again his peciliar views as to the want of balance between consumption and production; a somewhat one-sided plea by Mr. Wells that the study and construction of social ideals should form the main work in sociology; and at account of the teaching of sociology in America, by Professor Wenley. In the last paper the little that the Americans have as yet to teach us in sociology, though it is usually a University subject among them aiad is extensively studied, is laid bare. The subject appears to be as fisquently as not taught by rather incompetent persons who have " happened into " it. The great American Universities are as yet only feeling their way. S. J. CHAPMAN. The ApproacA to Philosophy. By RALIPH BARTON PERRY, Ph.D., Assis- tant Professor of Philosophy in Harvard University. London Longmans, Green IA Co., 1905. Pp. xxiv, 443. The intention of this book is an immense one, but it is well fulfilled. Mr. Perry does not introduce us to philosophy by making his volume a mere history or a mere exposition of systems. It has a life and vigour of its own, because the author is determined that hiq readers shall understand what the philosophic problem means, even if he has to aipproach it first from one side, retreat to approach it from a second, and again from a third. Part I. shows how philosophy has its roots in the life known to our familiar experience. Part II. is more technically employed in stating the problem as it is differentiated into questions of metaphysics, logic, epistemology, assthetics, ethics, theology or</page><page sequence="7">120 NEW :OOKS. psychology. Part- III. expounds the four great recurrent systematic tendencies discoverable in the various solutions offered of the philo- sophic problem-the systems of naturalism, subjectivism, absolute realism and absolute idealism. The book ends with a recapitulation of results, a statement of the present eclectic position of philosophy with a reference to the modern movements of "personal idealism" and "pragmatism," and a suggestion of Mr. Perry's own views. The first 'approach' is an easy and popular one, leading through business, poetry, religion and science, to philosophy. The best part of the section is the well-balanced essay on "Poetry and Philosophy ". It may be a heresy, but it is rather a happy and illuminating one to sum up Shakespeare as 'universal,' not 'philosophic'-as a poet, not a philosopher-poet-because he " puts no construction upon life " and " there is no Shakespearian point of view ". Of more pure philosophic interest, however, is Mr. Perry's contention, in his polemical chapter on ",i Natural Science and Philosophy," that natural science is not co- extensive with the whole of knowledge because it is abstract, because its conclusions, though they "may be abstractly true of everything, are tompletely true of nothing ". This criticism is the basis of his later rejection of naturalism as a satisfactory philosophy, although Mr. Perry makes it with an evident desire, not to spoil, from lack of moderation or acknowledgment, the present rapprochement between naturalism and idealism. But moderation is throughout characteristic of the book. It appears in the, second section in a warning not to press unduly what are' after all only rather convenient abstract dis- tinctions between problems, but to remember that there is no such thing as separate solution of logical, metaphysical or epistemological questions. Each involves the other. This second section, by the way, is the part of, the book which suffers. most from compression, and might J have been shorter had it been longer'. Mr. Perry has, further, made a real effort to reach sympathetically the positiou of the great system-makers. The result is lucid exposition -no small merit when, Absolute realism and Absolute idealism in their historic phases as rival theories of the Absolute have to be stated in concentrated form. These theories are left with their unsolved dilemma exposed to view---the presence of imperfection or evil within perfection as the Good. Mr. Perry's own position shows strongly the modern determination to do justice to all elements of experience- and withstand the attractions of - completeness if that is arrived at -by abstraction. Criticism has shown, he says, that reality can be construed neither in purely physical nor in purely psychical terms. Nor is it niore'successful to deduce the- whole of experience from an ideal of rational or moral perfection. Error and evil make this impossible. What happens if we abandon the idea of a perfect unity and adopt a pluralistic philosophy? Reality then contains various orders of which the- physical, psychical, moral and logical orders are some, and no one of these orders or systems is reducible to another. We seem,driven back to some such pluralism after trying and. repeating a series of monistic theories. From the moral side it has the merit of justifying endeavour to overcome evil, for evil is allowed to be a reality; from the religious side it makes God a worthy object of worship, because neither morally evil nor indifferent. The book makes pleasant reading, with a touch of humour breaking through now and then, and the author has an aptitude for coining telling phrases. The appended bibliographly should prove valuable to students. F; H. MELVILLE.</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 121 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. New Series, vol. vii. Con- taining the papers read before the Society during the Twenty- eighth Session, 1906-1907. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1907. Pp. 244. This annual volume again opens with a paper by the President. Dr. Rashdall's theme is " Nicholas de Ultricuria, a Medieval Precursor of Hume ". After noting the advantages possessed by clerical and denied to secular thinkers during the Scholastic era for getting their teaching diffused and their writings preserved and handed down, and the conse- quent oblivion to which some of the most original thought of the -mediaeval period of philosophy has been relegated, he takes up the remarkable instance of one such ne6glected Schoolman. Quoting pas- .sages from the works of this thinker and commenting upon their significance, he shows that they go far to anticipate the main theses -of Berkeley and of Hume. The Hon. B. Russell contributes a pgper " On the Nature of Truth," in which he argues that since the monistic theory of truth-that only the whole truth is wholly true-presents certain difficulties, and especially since there are reasons for rejecting the axiom on which it is based-that relations are always grounded in the natures of their terms-we must adopt another theory; namely, either that those beliefs (or propositions) are true which are beliefs in facts, or that those beliefs are knowledge whose objects are true proposi- tions (such propositions then being facts). In the former case, truth means some sort of correspondence between beliefs and facts ; in the latter, no account can be given of what makes a proposition true. Between these alternatives Mr. Russell does not here decide. In a paper "On Causal Explanation " Mr. T. Percy Nunn describes and illustrates different forms of scientific explanation, and gives historical examples of the use and nature of hypotheses. The next contributor is Miss E. E. Constance Jones, whose subject is " Logic and Identity in Difference ". Urging the importance for logic of precision in the use of this notion, and premising the distinction between individual or numeri- *cal identity and exact resemblance, she shows how various logical pro- cesses--assertion, classification, etc.-can be exhibited as forms of unity in difference. Discoursing upon " Humism and Humanism," Mr. F. C. S. Schiller maintains that, while these two types of philosophy resemble each other in being very pronounced empiricisms, and therefore in their common opposition to intellectualism, there are deep-seated differences both of attitude and doctrine between them; and that, indeed, on some most important points, there is a profound antithesis between them and .a marked congruity between Hume's scepticism and rationalism. Mr. S. H. Hodgson treats of " Fact, Idea, and Emotion," applying inspection -of the actual nature of conscious experience in elucidation of such topics as the meaning of the concept of being, the distinction of knowledge and existence, the concept of matter, the meaning of truth, and the nature of the moral criterion. Dealing with " Intuition "-its place in phil- *osophy and its relation to self-knowledge-Mr. A. T. Shearman urges that a satisfactory system of philosophy must be one based on intuitions which are comimon to manty different thinkePs; and contends (agreeing in part with Prof. Stout and in part with Prof. Dawes Hicks) that while sensory contents or intellectual elements are intuited or directly appre- hended, feeling, desire and activity are not, and that the subjective self, .although known to exist, is not matter of immediate apprehension. The volume closes with a paper on " Philosophy and Education " by Mr. B. Dumville. Pointing out the frequent separation yet necessary interde- -plendence of theory and practice,-he sketches the main lines of relation</page><page sequence="9">122 NEW BOOKS. between philosophy and education in the history of thought, and con- cludes by urging the pressing need for philosophical directors of educa- tion and the application of philosophy to the elucidation of educational problems. The Liberal State. A Speculation. BY THOMAS WHITTAKER. London: Watts &amp; Co., 1907. Pp. 202. In describing this thoughtful volume as a Speculation Mr. Whittaker takes the precaution to inform us that his forecast of the probable future of European political conditions is not a mere prophecy, or an attempt at prophecy. What he has tried to do is to give a sketch of a political ideal going in some respects beyond the existing order, but having its. basis in the past, and growing out of the past. The chief title of the book, " The Liberal State," he also tells us does not refer to contemporary party distinctions. By a Liberal State he means a State which accepts the principle of democracy and the principle of intellectual freedom as the permanent elements of an ideal polity. These two principles he con- siders would now be accepted by both political parties in English life, although they might sometimes differ in their interpretation of them. In Mr. Whittaker's opinion the real opposition to a Liberal State is to be found in a hierarchical or bureaucratic State in which a caste or an order of experts or the representatives of a doctrine govern without systematic popular control. Mr. Whittaker selects as the starting-point of his speculation the final crystallisa(tion of human society set forth in Comte's positive Polity. Of the three greatest synthetic intellects of the nineteenth century-Hegel, Comte and Spencer-he looks upon Comte as the most antipathetic in appearance to political Liberalism. But in spite of this antipathy to Liberalism Mr. Whittaker considers that Comte has not been of the slightest service to the defenders of the old authoritative order of society. If he will -consult one of the late Ferdinand Brunetiere's latest books he will find that this statement is a little too unqualified. In a volume pub- lished in 1905, entitled Sur les Chemrins de la Croyance, Brunetiere attempts to show how the principles of Positivism can be used for the rehabilitation of mediaeval Catholicism. Comte says Brunetiere shows that morality cannot constitute itself or justify itself or maintain itself independently of religion; that religion must be based on the affirmation of the supernatural, and finally that Catholicism is the response to these demands. Brunetiere it seems to me does not quite prove his case, but he produces a great deal of striking evidence from Comte's writings in favour of it; and in any event Brunetiere's work shows that Comte as well as Hegel or Spencer can be used in the interests of the old authori- tative order of things. But this is a side issue. It in no way affects the value of Mr. Whittaker's volume which is full of admirable reflexions and sagacious points of view. We agree with him that " Justice and Free- dom " are better watchwords than " Order and Progress ". It is probable, as he points out that the social order of the future will demand a more systematic regulation of industry on the part of the State, and that the State in the future will curtail the possibilities of acquiring social pre- dominance by the accumulation of wealth. Science, philosophy and poetic- thought are an admirable source of inspiration for many types of mind, but it is doubtful if they will ultimately supersede religion among the masses of mankind. It is no doubt true that the mediaeval formulas in which popular religion now finds expression have largely lost,their power. But the religious sentiment must not be confounded with the forms in which it temporarily finds expression. It possesses the power of casting</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 123 off antiquated formularies and of re-expressing itself in accordance with the highest and most inspiring ideals of individual and collective life. W. D. M. Lay Sermons and Addresses, Delivered in the Hall of Balliol College, Oxford. By EDWARD CAIRD, [LL.D., D.C.L., late Master. Glasgow; James MacLehose &amp; Sons, 1907. Pp. 312. During his tenure of the Mastership of Balliol College, Dr. Caird was in the habit of delivering a lay sermon, or address, at the beginning of each academical year; and twelve of these are now published in this volume. Several of them are suggested by current events, such as the death of Queen Victoria; some others are concerned with ethical pro- blems, more or less directly connected with the life of students; but most of them are of a more general character; and it may safely be said; that all of them have a certain interest for the student of philosophy, especially for the student of ethics and the philosophy of religion. Per- -.haps the most important, from this poinb of view, are the two that come at the end of the volume-on 'Immortality' and on ' The Faith of Job'. The former contains, so far as I am aware, the most definite pronounce- ment that the author has ever made on that great problem on which so many of our leading philosophical thinkers have lately been expressing opinions. This pronouncement, if less confident than that of some others, is at least pretty decidedly on the affirmative side. The dis- course on 'The Faith of Job' puts the author's general religious position in a singularly direct and impressive form. The idea of the organic unity of social, and especially of national, life is strikingly emphasised in several of the other lectures; -and they may serve to bring home the idealistic conception of the moral and religious life to many to whom a 'more esoteric treatment is inaccessible. It is hardly necessary to add that the book is characterised throughout by the ripe wisdom, the lucidity, and the felicity of phrase which have long been familiar to all the pupils and readers of Dr. Caird. J. S. MACKENZIE. Die Kultur der Gegenqvart, I., 6.-Systematische Philosophie. Berlin: Teubner, 1907, pp. viii, 432. This is a volume in a series-of encyclopaedic range. The volume consists of essays in each of which a writer of established reputation undertakes an appreciation of the achievement and tendency of some phase of the philosophical disciplines in relation to the culture of the, time. The word systematic is to be taken in the loose sense which it nowadays bears in Germany. Philosophy has abandoned its claim to uniqueness of method and its opposition of validity to fact, in being made to cover psychology. The essayists are independent one of another. Thus Wundt can characterise with complete detachment the metaphysical significance of Ostwald. The latter and-Riehl are at issue as to the value of the law of the economy of thought put forward by Avenarius. Paulsen's Mono- psychismus is alike alien from the views of Riehl and from the profession of faith with which Dilthey prefers to stop. Yet the spirit of the time has produced some unity of tendency. Negatively, there is among the writers no exponent of the dialectical method, no prophet of the abso- lute. Positively there is a common conviction that philosophy is essentially metempirical, though -whether or how far the stress is on</page><page sequence="11">124 NEW BOOKS. the first syllable of this adjective might well be in dispute. It is in the main to the Naturforscher that they look for the supply of their raw material, and he is accordingly more in honour than the Fachphilosoph. A mark of the completeness with which the shifting of emphasis has been effected is to be found in the fact that the article on psychology is the longest in the book. The general essay on the nature of philosophy with which the volume opens is by Dilthey. His fundamental thesis is an insistence on the phenomena of psychical structure, on conative continuity, or, more nearly in his own phrase, coherent unity of a selective or teleological character, which as objectified in society, in which the individual is concretely realised, finds itself included in a social structure or culture- system with a like coherence and unity of a purposive nature. Any culture-system in its historical evolution must orientate itself towards its environment and endeavour after a Weltanschauung of universal validity. Complete satisfaction, however, is unattainable, because the dominant categories obtained at this point in different spheres and from different angles are at once indispensable and irreducible alike to one another and to a common unity beyond them all. Being and End, e.g., refuse to collapse into unity, either by subordination of one to the other or by subsumption under some third. If we decline to mutilate the content, and equally, on the other hand, to sophisticate the form of our thinking, we must regard the prism of the world as never present, in any sing'le view; to the extent of more than one facet completely grasped. Hence the high significance of personality in philosophy. It is the function of the master, as of, the great artist, to present us witlr a lifescape that we have not had heretofore. In a momentary flash from a new angle, as it were, and under a controlled perspective, a subordination or suppression of some categories is rendered to intuition. Such thau- ,maturgy has no finality. The upshot, it should seem, is sheer relativism. Dilthey's answer is that it is not so, but rather the sovereignty of the spirit over all determinate points of view, conjoined with the conviction of the' existence for us of the single reality of the world, under the ex- pressions of its manysidedness in the enduring types of Weltanschauung (p. 62). Enforced with much eloquence and in particular enriched with a discussion of the points of contact and divergence between the philo- sophical outlook on 'the one hand, and the religious and again the poetic on the other, the exposition leaves the impression of dignity and of a rare atmosphere. A Religionsphilosophie is involved, and a philosophy of arL, as represented by poetry. The latter in especial is striking in the nicety of its illustrations and appreciations. In a list of names marking the stations of objective idealism Heraclitus and Shaftesbury are found with Spinoza and Hegel (p. 58)! Riehl's subject is Logic and Epistemology. His essay is the shortest in the book and packed full of matter, yet never disproportionate or failing in lucidity. His sense of the essential is so happy that he seems justified both in what he includes and what he omits. He opens with a brief but illuminating treatment of the Aristotelian logic, in which, having disposed of the pretension that the science of the form of science can be dependent on the special science of psychology, he exhibits the syllogism as involving insight into necessity. The phrases in which this is pointed out (p. 78; contrast Ostwald, p. 143), without using other than the stock instance, have almost the effect of originality. But he recognises that as real implication syllogism involved the assumption of the metaphysic of substantial forms, that as pure logic it was open to development along the'line of mathematical symbolismn and along the</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 125 line of a more radical doctrine of predication, and that as method it was not a good instrument of discovery. Accordingly he sets Galilei beside Aristotle as the creator of a new organon. When upon a hint from Plato the author of the Discorsi substituted analysis for abstraction and formiulated his metodo risolutivo, and further advanced upon Plato by applying it experimentally, logic as method rejected the antithesis between deductive and inductive methods and found its one way. 'The sciences separate in virtue of their objects are combined into the unity of science in virtue of their method,' which is not two but one-so Riehl argues against Rickert's demarcation of the historical sciences by their special method. It is probably the not wholly favour- able characterisation of the 'algebraic'logic (pp. 80-1, and p. 100, Note 2) that will most interest English readers. 'Speech too is only a symbol of thought, but it is its primary and most intimate symbol, whilst arti- ficial signs are symbols of symbols.' ' What separates the sphere of logic from that of mathematics proper is the concept of number,' and so on. Riehl's theory of knowledge is of course well known. His protest, however, against the neo-positivist theory of knowledge with its reliance on the concept of 'pure experience' and with its use of the law of parsi- mony is noteworthy. Pure experience is an ambiguous phrase defined in a circle by Avenarius himself, and as used by him involves an illicit abstraction. The validity of a concept is more than its 'economical' character ; it could not indeed be economical if it were not something more. Though the thinker criticised is Avenarius (p. 92 and p. 102, Note 1), Ostwald also is glanced at, who (infra, p. 149) says we might just as well emnploy a saw-toothed line as a straight one for our norm, were it not that the difficulties of calculation or construction would not be balanced by an increased fertility in scientific results. It is Ost- wald too who is in question when Riehl observes that, whatever the ulti- mate formula of Ernergetics is, it is irrelevant to the determination of the truth or otherwise of Kant's doctrine of the permanence of substance. Riehl's conclusion too is characteristic, to the effect that the principles of our Erfahrungswissen are immutable, progress being admissible only in the case of the special experiences dominated by these principles. Wundt follows with an article on metaphysics. His views on meta- physics having been developed elsewhere, he wisely elects not to repeat himself, and the result is a wise and witty essay, perhaps the brightest in the book. Having formulated and illustrated a law of three stages in the development of metaphysics, the poetic or mythopceic, the dialectic with its bifurcation into speculative idealism and realism severally, and the critical, he determines the stages or positions between stages, with or without a hark back or throw forward, tb which the leading teachers of the nineteenth century, and in especial some living writers, belong. Thus von HIartmann is regarded as having relapsed to the first stage, to which Schopenhauer had occasional and even frequent leanings. Heeckel's Riddle of the Universe is also naively mythopoeic. Ostwald and Mach, despite of their affinities and mutual sympathy, are allotted to the speculative and critical stage severally. Mach is 'an inverted Kant' in respect of his treatment of what Kant calls form and content of sensibility. Wundt"is well pleased to find these witnesses from the ranks of original opponents of metaphysics to the inevitability of the metaphysical impulse, and the persistence of types of philosophising. As to originality, Epigonen sind wir alle. Wundt closes with some remarks on the future of metaphysics, but, probably through his fear of poaching on Paulsen's preperves, they are disappointingly jejune. The notions of higher reality than that of phenomena and of the possi- bility of a deduction of phenomiena, must be abandoned. Metaphysics</page><page sequence="13">126 NEW BOOKS. admits of no progressus in this sense, only a regressus. Wundt's anti- Hegelian convictions do not prevent some wise and sympathetic remarks on Hegel, as on Herbart, whom he equally regards as a spent force. Ostwald deals with the philosophy of nature. Joying in the uncer- tainty of logical process, and therefore in the trans-experiential and prophetic character of any scientific ratiocination, he regards all science as empirical and abstract. Its abstractions in its dealings with its empirical material are subjective in their inception, but not arbitrary in virtue of the principle of economy. Beyond the particular sciences there is room for post-naturalia of a kind, the most general concepts relative to the sphere of independent things, i.e., to the region from which we receive energy beyond the threshold-value of our sensibility. Here comes in Energetik, which further bulks large in Ostwald's classifi- cation of the sciences. The classification is admittedly of Comtist inspiration, though the first group in it, that of the logico-mathematical sciences, owes its principle of sequence to the speculations of Peano. The introduction of self-regulation of streams of energy with the biological sciences is evidently a source of trouble to the writer, his older, naturalism and newer pragmatism not fully fusing. Ostwald closes with an indication of questions which neither the research of natural science nor philosophy of nature, which seems to differ from Forschmng only in generality and posteriority, can answer. The treatment of psychology is in the safe hands of Ebbinghaus. In part he draws upon the published portion of his Grundzaige, and the chief interest belongs naturally to the discussions of such subjects as belief, religion and art, which correspond to what he holds still in manuscript. The way in which past experience enriches but controls perception as opposed to sense and bulks still larger in representation, and again in organised thought, has for result a cleavage between subjec- tive conviction and objective correctness. The former dominates the childhood of the individual and the race where the experience is slight and analogy the fruitful source of advance and mistake. We grow sub- jectively more sceptical, objectively more of realists in the plain man's sense of the word. Among the more persistent beliefs or subjective convictions are certain responses to need, among which the religious faith in help for our ignorance and our weakness amid a hostile environ- ment, in remedies for miseries of growing foresight, to adapt a phrase from Rousseau,. is* the most prominent. The felt need for help is, through the machinery of animism, based on the phenomena of dream and the like, crystallised in the belief in a world of environing spirits, gbod and bad, to be conciliated like our fellows good and bad if we but knew how. Cult and the medicine-man emerge. Seeming failure is ideally. cancelled by a prorogation of the ultimate issue to the life beyond. The growth of the moral life leads to the moralisation of the spirit-world and the consequent fading of polytheism and nationalism. The growth of knowledge disintegrates the idea of interference. But the future still is dark, and the fear of perils which we cannot meet recurrent. The moral god and the god who is only manifest in, if not identical with, the world and its uniform lawa, still are objects of faith in which the believ-ers find what they seek, succour against the unknown and fearful, rest to the heart. Art too is a support against the unsatisfying enjoyments that breed satiety and reaction and new desire. Possibly religious in use to begin with, and with its raw materials employed to give greater chances of survival through sexual selection, it is only as chosen for its own sake or as an end satisfaction that it finds its characteristic place in human life. Other characteristiq things in Ebbinghaus are his brief appreciations of his predecessors-Herbart, Fechner, and 'the rest-his</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 127 degradation, of 'so-called Phantasie' to quite minor significance, and again his vigorous maintenance of the thesis that natural causation presents a closed system, in which he makes use of Rubner's experi- ments as to energy in animal life, and of Atwater's proofs that man is no exception to the rest of the animal world. Rudolf Eucken writes on the philosophy of history, with some indebtedness to Flint. In his interesting survey of the history of this branch he omits all reference to the Politics of Aristotle, and shows already that it is the tiine-problem that absorbs him. In order to philosophise happenings in time a point of view is needed from which time is irrelevant. How is this possible? Only, thinks Eucken, if history be the point of contact between the Dasein of men as natural beings in the time-order and a Geistesleben transcending this time-order. We need a new idealism. The essay is somewhat rhetorical and not always quite clear. 'It might perhaps be held that the solution as here worked out is only a restatement ot the problem. Paulsen's article on Ethi2s expounds the antithesis of the teleological ethics of energeia to the etliics of duty, and declares for the former. The good or end gets its content in the action of the tribal or social self upon the individual. This relation of individual to society rieeds grounding in an objective idealism which shall find room within it for the facts of historical evolution. In naming Spencer's Principles of Morality as a work of allied tendency Paulsen is surely a little misleading. Spencer could not admit the objective idealism without which the interrelations of individual and society require a different explanation, and Spencer's hedonism, though finally perhaps 'transfigured,' is of the essence of his view, though to Paulsen it would be repugnant and unpsychological. Munlch discourses adequately of Pcdagogik. Sitting loose from for- mule, he has been able to touch lightly and suggestively on the main problems and theories in an exceedingly readable essay. His select bibliography is sufficient for the purpose in hand. Lipps on the subject of .Esthetics presents a complete contrast. Taking the line (as he says, p. 388) that this sketch cannot well be anything but the reproduction of certain fundamental ideas of his larger work, he has been hampered by the limitations of space, and has' produced a rather dry summary. His consideration of the exact nature of the subjectivism of aesthetic appreciation is of course of per- manent value, and he has some subtle remarks on the nature of a mixed art, such as musical drama, and the relation of its product to the products of the parent arts severally. To Paulsen finally, who alone contributes two essays, is delegated the task of outlining the problem of the future, and of estimating the tendencies of the present and the solution they make for. He starts from Kant, btit dissents from the master's phenomenalism in regard to the inner life, his doctrine of the empirical self. Within us we have a revelation of that which is per se, and, through the involvement of the external phenomenon with the psychical reality for which it is, we get an extension of the conviction of reality to the external also, so far as it can be conceived as psychically or spiritually constituted. We reach something that may be cajled Monopsychismus. The saltus involved 'in this form of psychical interpretation of the physical is doubtless the cause of the favour with which Paulsen regards the voluntarist tendency of much contemporary philosophising. His refusal to help himself out by means of an eclectic compromise with vitalism is creditable. That the objectivity of his idealism must be achieved from a subjective and relativist starting-point is again perhaps a ground for his insistence on Phantasie as a characteristic of all the great philosophic thinkers,</page><page sequence="15">128 NEW BOOKS Spinoza not excepted, nor- Kant, at least so far as Architectonic goes. And to a reflective anthropomorphism is consistently assigned the role, of metaphysical method. Der Anthropomorphismus, wenn man so will, ist die Methode der Metaphysik. And he goes on; 'apparently no recom- mendation. It will, however, remain the last word' (p. 405). Truly we may say with Wundt that it is the day of the Epigoni! HERBERT W. BLUNT. Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie. FRANZ BRENTANO, Leipzig: Duncker und Humboldt, 1907. Pp. 161. M.4.20. This book consists of lectures delivered before various societies during the last fifteen years by the author, the well-known psychologist and logician. The first (held in 1893) and its replica (No. 4, 1905) treat of 'phenomenal green," while the second, from the International Congress of 1896, treats of the individuation, multiple quality, and intensity of sensuous phenomena. The third, which will not be discussed further here, works out analogies between vision and hearing. Is (phenomenal) green not a mixture of the (sensations) blue and yellow ? Brentano's chief justification of this prelimiinary question is the fact that painters always call green a mixture of blue and yellow, whereby the objection that they do so because they usually obtain green by mix- ing yellow and blue pigments, is of no avail, because they obtain green often otherwise and moreover do not claim to see red and green in a grey got by mixing red and green pigments. Brentano develops a new theory of colour vision, in which red, yellow and blue ar6 the funda- mental colours from which all others are got by mixture, while each is accompanied by a white component. Complementary phenomena are due to the suppression of the positive colours by the intensity of the white components of each, which reinforce each other. Contrast and after-images are always of such a kind that their colour is the resultant of the mixture of those elementary colours which were not in the stimu- lus, e.g., stimulus, yellow-after-image, blue-red, i.e., violet. Brentano supports this statement by reference to experiments. He believes that his system enables him with moderate assumptions to overcome difficul- ties inherent in ilenrig's dissimilation-assimilation theory. The facts of colour-blindness lastly are harmonised by the formulation of the law: he who lacks one colour (e.g., red), lacks also the possibility of pheno- menal mixture of the two others he still has (i.e., blue and yellow to gxeen) (p. 41). Brentano's theory reinstates Young's elementary colours and justifies Gothe's observations. So much for the theory, which is as good as any other, if it arranges and explains all the facts equally well. It is howevet evident that the leading motive for Brentano is the fact that the best colour observers (painters) see blue and yellow in green. Green stands naturally in the centre of the discussion, because the theories of colour-vision of both Helmholtz and Henrig look upon green as a simple elementary colour. It is almost taken for granted that orange, for instance, is a "phenomenal " mixture of red and yellow. The difficulties begin of-course with the psychological realism which necessarily follows from Brentano's theory, e.g., in the view that from a mixture of blue and y'ellow white results because the blue and yellow sensations, which are really there, are overweighted by the double dose of white sensation and are only noticeable as a faint green. We see green, i.e., blue and yellow together, in the spectrum, because blue and yellow sensations are here excited with at least only one white com- ponent and are therefore visible. This theory leads naturally to the</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 129 further realistic theory, that the intensity of sensation is to be conceived as its degree of density and to' the statement that in any very weak colour all five colours, black, white, red, yellow and blue, are all present together. It is perhaps better not to be too confident about such obser- vations. In any case the. painter's observation has no right to decide between the views that green is a phenomenal mixture of yellow and. blue, and that green is like blue and like yellow, any more than it has in the case of orange. It is the more reserved attitude willingly to recog- nise the resemblances between colours and the agreement between these resemblances and the more likely physiological theories of colour-vision and to be very chary about building a psychological theory of colour- vision on the one or the other. These physiological theories of colour- vision, resting, as they do, entirely on equations of , colour-mixture, negative idstances, such as colour-blindness and other equally objective observations, do not involve or support a; psychological theory of colour- vision of a realistic kind at all. Essay II. develops the thesis already mentioned that intensity of sen- sation is to be explained as greater density of sensation particles. Sen- sations are of different quality and are individualised and localised by their place in a sensation-space, as times in a time-space. They are im- penetrable the one to the other, and they cani be present in greater or less density while differences in such density and in quality cannot be perceived under a certain -degree. Suppose two kinds of sensation- elements mixed together, so that the distance of the elements from one another is below the threshold of perception, then the result in a mas- sive sensation will be a multiplicity of distinguishable, but inseparable qualities. This is exemplified in sensations of sight- and hearing, e.g., green = blue + yellow sensation particles; dark green = green particles of' low density with black sensation particles in the spaces ; so tone- fusion. The psychic world is in every way analogous to the physical world, though the latter as against Wundt, is not dispensable. Surely the answer to all this is the very argument Brentano uses in the first and fourth essays, namely, that direct introspection reveals in the localisation of sensations something more than a sensation of a certain quality in a certain position in a sensation world. The localisation of sensations is itself an experienced fact in quite another manner to the difference in experience, if any, which results from two otherwise similar experiences happening merely at different times. Similarly, the character of intensity is a matter of direct experience, which, though possibly explicable by a theory of the density of psychological elements of a realistic nature, is not removed by such a theory. It is easier to assent to these intro- spective facts than to work out the exceedingly complex implications of Brentano's theory. Brentano says his theory explains why there is an upper and a lower limit to intensity, namely, because the elements won't be compressed beyond' a certain point, but surely there is no more trouble in accepting the fact of lower and upper limits of intensity, than in accepting, as Brentano does, the fact of a threshold of perception for degrees of density. H. T. WATT. Die Elemente der Erziehungs- und Unterrichtslehre. Auf Grund der Psychologie der Gegenwart. Dargestellt von Dr. Paul Barth, a.o. Professor an der Universittt zu Leipzig. Leipzig: 1906. Verlag von Johann Ambrosius Barth. Pp. xi, 515. M. 7.20. This treatise is an attempt to deal with the science of Education in the light of the most recent advances in Psychology and Sociology. It 9</page><page sequence="17">130 NEW BOOKS. deals with theory, and is especially concerned with the p-ractiO&amp;I side of instruction. It refuses to adapt itself to spe(,ial grades of schools or instructors, and regards the work of education as, the same in principle in all grades. The first part of the work considers Education and Instruction in general, dealing with the formation of will and feeling. Under the heading of the formation' of the mind, the author treats of Anschauung, Attention, Judgments, formation of Concepts, " System- bildung ". The Lehr-plan and Lehr-gang are discussed. On thL practical side every subject of the school curriculum is carefully considered, and its rationale determined. The work consists of over 500 large ootav@ pages, and its especial feature is the wide reading of the latest and best, writers worthy of consideration, which the author has undertaken before forming his conclusions. It is a book which may fairly be offered to, the -educational sceptic, to show that there is 'something' to occupy the -mind of a student in this new ' science of education'. Education can claim to be a 'learned' profession, not only in the academic subjects which the teacher must know, like every other student, but also in the very ground-work of his -profession. In Dr. Barth's book the subject /looms as learned as, say, a book on the theory of law. Moreover, Dtr. -Barth is in the vanguard of educational thought. In considering the -aim of education, he criticises the suggestions of ilerbart and Basedow, but prefers the view of Schleiermacher, 'that education has for aim the .cultivation of fitness for the life of the community. Education, in Dr: Barth's view, has grown out of the idea of the social life. If education is to prepare the pupil for the life of human intercourse, it must be by 'regarding the individual as a social unit. Society is earlier than the individual, in the logical sense of the term. The sociological basis has worked enormous results in jurisprudence. It will probably effect great. modifications in the theory of education, possibly requiring considerable reconsideration, say, from the Herbartians. There is no doubt, as, indeed, Dr. Barth perceives, that the historical element will play a greater part in, the theory of education than it has hitherto done, possibly with as much fruit as in the province of political economy. It is to be wished that Dr. Barth had treated the historico-sociological aspect of education in greater detail. The present-day scientific theories,, as Dr. Barth points out, may modify all our old theories of education, especially the old views of the influence of heredity, on the formation of character. The factor of 'Variation' came from the physical side ; now from the psychical side comes 'Suggestion'. The whole tendency of -modern science, therefore, seems to point to a great hopefulness in dealing with the most conservative factors of human nature, e.g., dis- positions, inclinations, 'instincts,' as susceptible of more ready modifi- cations than were supposed. Baldwin is probably right, says Dr. Barth, when he says: "Suggestion is just as much an original and motor impulse as pleasure and pain ". Dr. Barth in one passage shows the bearing of his general sociological view on the Curriculum. He says: " A complete statement of the theory of education and of instruction would enter into the details of the present condition of the organisation of educational institutions, would treat of their gradation, their dependence on the State and on society, their essential spirit and their external regulations. And not less desir- .able would be (in accordance with the direction which the author wishes should be given to the whole work of education) an acquiescent or re- jecting judgment on them. But such a criticism could only be built upon a thorough, historical survey of the development of education, 1which would here presume especially the correlation of education with the changes in society. This cannot be enclosed within the compass of this</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 131 volume." Dr. Barth intends to make such an exposition and also criticism, in a later book. We can only hope that Dr. Barth will be able to execute this task. It would not only be an extremely interesting undertaking, but would exhibit in a concrete form the significance of the alliance of education with sociology. The tendency of some impor- tant educationists at the present day to suppose that a theory of education is virtually independent of a study of its history, is purely doctrinaire. Dr. Barth's proposed work would do much to bring Edu- cational Theory into line with the inquiries which have produced the best recent results in the study of Jurisprudence and Economics. FOSTER WATSON. Fortschritte der Kinderseelenkunde. By WILHELM AMENT, Ph.D. Leipzic: Engelmann. Pp. 76. Vervenkrankheit und Lekture. By Prof. H. OPPENHEIM. Berlin: Karger. Pp. 120. The Psychology of Child Development. By IRVING KING, Chicago. Lon- don: Fisher Unwin. Pp. 265. These little books all deal with the problems of Child Study. In the first Dr. Ament, in remarkably brief space, classifies and summarises the manifold contributions to this subject which were made between the years 1895-1903. He has thus provided students with a guide-book and bibliography which should be of no little value in view of the bewildering multiplicity of articles bearing upon the nature and development of the child. Dr. Ament has not- included in his guide-book any sufficient account of what has been done by medical men in the way of correlating the physical and psychical features of children's growth. That this side of child study is worthy of attention is shown by the three valuable essays of Prof. Oppenheim, whose observations on the nervous condition of children at different ages are of the greatest practical value. Mr. King's Psychology of Child Development aims at presenting a con- sistent and intelligible outline of the mental development of the child from the standpoint of mental function. The point which he specially emphasises is that " there is a psychology of the child-mind that is essentially different from that of maturity, simply because it is not legitimate to discuss mental powers and contents in and of themselves, but only with reference to their setting in experience, and further because in children we have a different sort of an experience from that possessed by the adult ". Prof. Dewey has written an introduction in which he approves of the method of the author. The book, however, claims more originality than it seems to pbossess. JOHN EDGAR. Die Beeinflussung der Sinnesfunctionen durch geringe Alkoholmengen. I. Teil. WILHELM SPECHT. Leipzig: Engelmann, 1907. Pp. 115. M. 1.60. This careful and interesting piece of work is the first of a series of papers by the author on the effect of alcohol on psychical processes. He de- parts from the methods used by Kraepelin in favour of an examination of the absolute threshold and the difference threshold for sound, and obtains good results, although his review of the work of Kraepelin and his pupils is not always quite just. It is at least not obvious that Wundt's views on apperception and association are so very precise and sufficient, that a short statement of them should discount Kraepelin's</page><page sequence="19">132 NEW BOOKS. method of association experiments and his statement of his results. Besides, the work on memory has shown that a seemingly elementary process, as is for instance present in the determination of the difference threshold, is not necessarily a more favourable instrument for obtaining results of a certain kind, than a seemingly more complex one. Specht found that the difference threshold rises and the absolute threshold falls under the influence of alcohol (40, 20, 10 c.c.). Different degrees of poisoning show themselves in the varying tendency of the observer to be dominated by the intensity of the last perceived stimulus, a weak second stimulus seeming more intense than a preceding louder one. This the author shows to be due probably to the lapse under alcohol of the ability to compare sensations. The momentary sensation then becomes more penetrating to the observer, so that the absolute threshold falls, and the difference threshold rises. The results obtained in this paper are clear and seem thoroughly reliable. H. J. W. Probleimi della Scienza. By FEDERIGO ENRIQUES. Bologna; Zanichelli, 1906. Pp. iv, 593. This work forms probably the most thorough and comprehensive study that has appeared in recent years of the concepts on which modern science -is built. Included in its scope are a general discussion of the possibility, aims and limits of Science, and a detailed treatment of the special problems of Logic, Geometry, Mechanics, Physics' and Biology. It is written with a profound knowledge of the histor-y and modern developments of Science, and with a critical grasp of the trend of philosophical thought and of the underlying psychological questions, such as are rarely found united in one mind. Certainly the work should contribute in no small degree towards the end which its author desires to have realised-that of a scientific education by which the labourer in every special field may understand how the subject of his own research is subordinated to the more general problems. The aim of the volume is what is called a Positive Gnoseology (p. 70), the first problem of which is to determine the criteria implied in our conception of objective reality, as opposed to illusion and error of the senses; but it has to deal also with the technique of observation and experiment, the nature of mental elaboration, the validity of concepts, etc. Thus, while Logic shows the ideal method of procedure in scientific construction, the method of proof, Gnoseology will show the real methods, the methods of discovery. It is a direct critical examination of Science, regarded as itself the fact to be explained. Reality me4ns, according to Enriques, the correspondence of sensa- tions with expectation; a real existing by itself, independently of our experience, is simply an absurdity. His criticism of this conception, as of those of an object-in-itself, a subject-in-itself, an absolute-in-itself, and his insistence on the essential relativity of the distinctidns from which they arise, are both novel and interesting. On the other hand, he recognises to a greater extent than most " positive " critics the function of imagery and hypotheses in the progress of science, as ideas directive of experience and research. Indeed he shows that much that passes for objective knowledge, for example the mechanical view of niture, is inherently imagery or subjective "modelling ". Throughout the work it is argued that the fundamental logical processes, in the building and development of concepts, are really psychological, i.e., the processes of association and dissoQiation, under the regulation of the will. For example, " to think an object is to determine it precisely, to</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS. 133 distinguish it as recognisable,. i.e., to inhibit the course of those uncon- scious associations that would tend to modify its image ". This is the small modicum of validity allowed to the principles of Substance, Cause, Energy, of the " Higher Logic ". " Successive Approximations " is the keynote of Enriques' conception of scientific knowledge. Metaphysics itself is held to be subject to the same law, otherwise known as the law of " Least Effort "-" that new associations, representing causal relations, tend to effect themselves along the associative tracts already laid down by other habitual pro- cesses " (p. 259). These principles, as has been said, are applied in the second part of the work to the special sciences of Geometry, Mechanics, Physics and Biology. The net result of a really brilliant analysis is to show that the law of universal mechanism, the ground-assumption of the physical sciences, is itself, as usually expressed, a transcendent concep- tion which must be set aside. In Physics it is possible to retain the spirit of this universal mechanism and of the determinismn it implies. In Biology, on the other hand, the teleological remains a distinct and valid principle of judgment alongside of-but not in conflict with-the mechanical. The teleological explanation expresses a first degree of knowledge, the inference from effect to cause; it may give place at any time to the more perfect type of explanation-the mechanical, that from cause to effect. But while there is no contradiction between the teleological and the mechanical explanations of the phenomena of life, on the other hand-and this is the conclusion of the work-the mechani- cal hypothesis may be regarded as both indifferent and irrelevant to the progress of Biology. The cases with which the latter has to deal are so infinitely complex, and therefore so many complementary hypotheses become necessary, that the mechanical one (with which we start) almost or wholly disappears. J. L. M. Le Base dell' Umcanismo. By P. R. TRoiANo. Turin, Rome, Milan: Fratelli Bocca, 1907. Pp. 244. Prof. Troiano, who teaches moral philosophy in the University of Turin, has attempted in this very lucid and interesting volume to sketch the outlines of a 'critical humanism' or 'humanistic spiritualism,' of which he considers successively the epistemology, the theory of value and the religious applications. The vigour, common sense and common honesty of his polemic against absolutism plainly show that genuine and thorough going humanism has taken firm root in Italy, where apparently absolutism is bither not so powerful or not so fanatical as elsewhere. It would sometimes seem, however, that the most exact equivalent of Prof. Troiano's 'humahism' would be what in British Philosophy has (inade- quately enough) been called 'personal idealism'. For, though he often argues pragmatically (e.g., pp. 63, 187, 202), and there can be no question of his decided anti-intellectualism, the relations he conceives to exist between what he calls 'pragmatism' and his own 'humanism' are not conceived quite as a British 'humanist' would conceive them. Thus he distinguishes (pp. 14-15) humanism from pragmatism, and holds that the latter tends to confound the conceptions of being and value, truth and utility, and to restrict the field of scientific research. From other passages, however, it would seem that the ground of this discrepancy is twofold, and neither serious nor tenable. In the first place, Prof. Troiano appears to construe ' pragffiatism ' rather too narrowly, as mean-</page><page sequence="21">134 NEW BOOKS. ing chiefly 'fideism,' i.e., its application to religion (cf. pp. 73, 197). Secondly, his logical objection to a completely pragmatic view of truth seems to be due to his having (quite unnecessarily) retained too much of the old phraseology about the fundamental distinction of 'theory' and 'practice,' ' fact' and ' value'. But that these antitheses are fallacious and untenable appears at once when the question is raised as to what except 'practical' consequences enables us to distinguish between 'true' and ' false ' theory, and what but its ' value ' leads to the recognition 'of 'fact'. In other words, the antitheses between the true, the useful and the valuable break down so soon as they are taken dynamically as the products of a cognitive process., That this should have escaped so good a humanist as Prof. Troiano, is the more surprising that he sees clearly how impossible it is to separate the three functions of valuing, acting and contemplating (p. 57), and actually declares (p. 93) that " the true is that which has value for the intellect and is the good thereof ". But as against the abstractions, mutilations and misrepresentations of the tra- ditional intellectualism, Prof. Troiano is a strenuous champion of the unity and integrity of the human spirit. F. C.
