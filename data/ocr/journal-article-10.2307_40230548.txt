<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume IV, Number 4, June 1975 CRITICAL NOTICE Pierre Laberge: La Théologie Kantienne Prêcritique. (Editions de l'Université d'Ottawa, Ottawa, 1973) Pp. 192. Monsieur Laberge's book is a study of Kant's views on the nature and existence of God as expressed in three works in particular: the Allgemeine Naturgeschichte of 1755, the essay on the first principles of metaphysical knowledge (the Nova Dilucidatio) of the same year, and the treatise on the only possible ground of proof of God's existence (Beweisgrund) of 1763. Reference is made to certain other writings of the pre-critical period, including the essay on Negative Quantities of 1762, the 1763 Prize Essay on the clarity of the principles of natural theology and morals and the treatise Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766). There is also some comparison of the conclusions reached in the works studied with the views advocated in the first two Critiques. Laberge endorses the claim of Josef Schmucker that Kant's criticism of rational theology cannot be seen as a simple corollary of the conclusions of the Transcendental Analytic, since it was already complete by 1763. He further argues that the positive doctrines advocated in the Critique - the 'moraj' theology which was to take the place of its discredited 'speculative' counterpart - look back to the pre-critical theology and are built on the basis of its concepts if not of its explicit conclusions. But he adds that certain ambiguities which belonged to Kant's thought on the subject at this relatively early date survive in his mature thinking: moral theology itself makes use of a concept of God which is not altogether appropriate for its purposes. The book closes with the observation that we are confronted here once again with the old conflict between the God of the philosophers and the God of the believer. On the main point here I must say at once that Laberge is too brief to be convincing. I have spoken above of Kant's 'moral theology', but the phrase scarcely appears in Laberge's pages. Reference is made to the passage in the Critique of Practical Reason in which Kant says that the concept of God belongs neither to physics nor to metaphysics but to morals, and a clear account is given of how the sense of unconditional moral obligation could provide a point of departure for a proof of God's existence which would be altogether less precarious than any to which Kant appealed in his 723</page><page sequence="2">W. H. Walsh pre-critical period. But no emphasis is placed on the extraordinary differences Kant saw between a moral proof of God's existence and a speculative proof: the subjective character of the former is simply left out of account. Nor is there any serious attempt to explain the terms in which the average decent man - the person who acknowledges the authority of moral obligation, whether or not he respects it in practice - frames his concept of God. Laberge is anxious to make out that the God Kant favours is one who is all-sufficient, absolutely transcendent, the creator of all things, a spirit: it is his thesis that this was how Kant himself thought of God when he wrote the Beweisgrund. But the God who functions in 'moral belief is conceived as a holy lawgiver, a just judge, a beneficent ruler {Critique of Practical Reason, Berlin edition, V 1 30), terms which are anthropomorphic and concrete rather than part of the abstract vocabulary of the learned of any sort. Admittedly Kant holds that behind this popular conception there lies a less familiar, more scientific-sounding, notion, in which God is thought through pure categories, as for example first cause or original substance. But this notion has no genuine part to play in the thinking of actual moral agents, nor if it had would it favour, say, a creationist rather than a Spinozistic conception of God. It seems to me that Laberge here has not sufficiently appreciated the radical character of Kant's thinking on this subject in the period of the Critiques] he has not seen that the moral man's commitment to God's existence is totocaelo different from that which any speculative theorist could claim. His failure to do this I connect with the allegiance he acknowledges to the 'ontological' interpretation of Kant according to which Kant destroyed traditional metaphysics only to replace it with a metaphysics of his own based on morals. Kant at the end of his critical enquiries wanted to hang on to certain metaphysical convictions, but to describe these as constituting a metaphysics in anything like the ordinary sense - a supposed branch of science - is to misrepresent his thought grossly. Otherwise what sense can be made of the remark about abolishing knowledge in order to make room for faith? The claim that Kant's critique of rational theology was already complete by 1763 is not one which can be accepted without difficulty. For one thing, Kant himself was a convinced rational theologian at the time he wrote the Beweisgrund: he believed that unaided human reason could construct a watertight proof of God's existence, a proof which argued from the fact that there are possibilities to the existence of an absolutely necessary being. According to Kant, this proof had the certainty of a mathematical demonstration and so was in principle capable of convincing any clear-thinking sceptic, however otherwise depraved. By contrast the moral proof put forward in the Critique is supposed to appeal only to the man who feels the force of moral obligation: this is why Kant says that the 724</page><page sequence="3">Laberge, Théologie Précritique Kantienne believer should say 7 am certain that there is a God', not It is certain that there is a God*. The very fact that he had not reached this point in the pre-critical period shows the incompleteness of Kant's deliberations about rational theology at this stage. But there were other deficiencies in his grasp of the anti-metaphysical case. Certainly he had already taken the very important steps of seeing that the Ontological Argument in its Cartesian form breaks down because existence is not an ordinary predicate, and of realising that the Wolffian first cause argument can be got to work only if the necessary being it concludes to can be identified with God. But he had not yet formulated the latter point even with the imperfect clarity it enjoys in the Critique of Pure Reason. Nor had he distinguished at all clearly between the first cause argument proper - the 'cosmological' argument of the critical period - and the argument from design, and shown that the latter presupposes the former and therefore, if the previous point is correct, the Ontological Argument as well. It is arguable that in some respects the treatment of the teleological proof in the Beweisgrund, in particular in its distinction of Ordinary' and 'improved' teleology, is superior to the treatment in the Critique. But on the very important point of the relationship of the teleological argument to other ways of proving God's existence Kant was still a long way from his best. He knew that an empirical argument of this kind could never be fully convincing, a point which he had not reached in 1755. But he did not yet possess the neat demonstration of its insufficiency which was so impressive a part of his armoury in 1 781 . Indeed, it seems all too clear that at this stage Kant was much too soft about the argument from design, too ready to be sympathetic to it in a sophisticated form if not quite in the form in which it circulated in popular thought. As Laberge makes clear, he came on the scene as a convinced defender of optimism, arguing at one point that if it were established that the world must run down completely as a result of the operation of natural laws, even that would be something we must assume to be for the best. That the person who held this view should subsequently have written an essay on the failure of all attempts to produce a theodicy is a measure of the distance his thought still had to travel. If Kant himself in his pre-critical works had a weakness for the design argument, Laberge might be said to be fascinated by the strange argument from possibility which, following other commentators, he labels Ontotheological' (Kant in the Beweisgrund confusingly called it the Ontological' argument, referring to the proof usually known by that name as 'Cartesian'). This argument first appeared in the Nova Dilucidatio and was presented in a more detailed and elaborate form in the Beweisgrund. Laberge begins his comment by maintaining against Klaus Reich that the two works contain versions of one and the same argument; on this point he is entirely convincing. He then goes on to claim that whereas in the Nova 725</page><page sequence="4">W. H. Walsh Dilucidatio the God whose existence is inferred on the strength of this argument is a totality (Inbegriff) of all realities (real qualities), the corresponding God of the Beweisgrund is presented as a supreme being {fiöchstes Wesen) who is the ground of all realities. The difference is accounted for by Kant's having noticed in 1763 something which had escaped him in 1755, that a totality of realities would include material as well as mental characteristics, with the result that a postulation of its existence would amount to subscription to Spinozism. There is evidence both in contemporary Reflexionen and in the late Fortschritte der Metaphysik that Kant was alive to the horrors of Spinozism; according to Laberge they were never far from his mind. But it is also Laberge's view that the device he employed in 1763 to escape a Spinozistic conclusion, by distinguishing between primary and derived characteristics, was at the best estimate dubious and at the worst positively fraudulent. If this distinction is not made, says Kant, we shall have to admit that there is real opposition inside the concept of the totality of realities, since extension and thought are really opposed. The presence of real opposition would argue defect, which is inconsistent with the character of a totality of realities. Laberge claims that the notion of such a totality is here appealed to in support of itself, and thus that the argument contains a petitio. I should prefer myself to say that the question is begged at the point at which it is said that extension and thought are really opposed, the more so because real opposition has to do with fact rather than concepts. But I also think we should remember that what Kant is trying to argue here has a long history behind it: the distinction of primary and derived characteristics looks back to the scholastic distinction between owning a property formally and owning it eminently, used in Descartes' third Meditation. To do justice to Kant we need to study that history and see how, if at all, he improved on received views. I said that Laberge was fascinated by the possibility argument, though clearly he is not uncritical of what Kant says about it. Where he is uncritical, or at least unsatisfactory, is in not looking the argument in the face and exposing it for the poor thing it is. Kant says in these works that, if anything is to be possible, something must be actual, and indeed that there must be something which is supremely actual and constitutes, as it were, a primary actualisation of basic possibilities. It is difficult to make the argument precise, or to give it a respectable sounding expression. What, if anything, is there to be said for it? It might be claimed first that the possible depends on the actual in at least this respect, that no-one could have the concept of the possible unless he had the concept of the actual. By the same token, however, he could not have the concept of the actual unless he had the concept of the possible: the two ideas are reciprocally related. Secondly, it could be argued that the possible depends on the 726</page><page sequence="5">Laberge, Théologie Précritique Kantienne actual in another sense, that for the possible to be conceived of there must be something actual, namely the person who forms the idea. This is true, but not wildly interesting. Thirdly, it might be contended that actualities must in general be prior to possibilities since otherwise we could never form concepts: simple concepts to which nothing answered would be impossible. I suspect that Kant may have sympathised with this view and that he subscribed to some version of it in his remarks about fundamental data (primary characterisatics). But if he did I can only say that his doing so was something of a scandal. In the Critique Kant saw that a concept was not a copy of something in reality; at the time he wrote the Beweisgrund he may still have been making Lockean assumptions on the point. But even if it were a fact that possibilities thus presupposed actualities, it would not follow that there must be what I previously called a primary actualisation of basic possibilities. As Kant came to see himself, the most that could be claimed is that the notion of such an actualisation is necessary for thought. That it must further be real is a view which remains quite unsupported. The main weakness of Laberge's careful and scholarly book seems to me to lie in its failure to discuss such general points as these. I also find what it says about the relation of the ontotheological argument to the discussions of the Critique of Pure Reason somewhat puzzling. Laberge says that Kant does not mention in the Critique the line of argument which in 1763 constituted for him the only possible ground of proof of God's existence. This is formally true: the alleged proof from possibility is just silently dropped. Not, however, without leaving any trace of itself. On the contrary, section 2 of the Ideal of Pure Reason clearly represents it in altered form, as its Latin title ('Prototypon Transcendental, echoing the 'exemplar1 of Dissertation, § 9), makes clear. I find it hard to understand how anyone who knows the Beweisgrund could fail to see that Kant is here looking back, no doubt with regret but equally without illusion, to the proof he had formerly cherished, and bringing himself to admit that it was no good. It is not true that there must be a primary actualisation of basic possibilities for anything to be possible; the most that condition requires is that we have the idea of an, or the, ens realissimum. By clinging on to that idea Kant doubtless goes a lot further than most, if not all, of those who have thought about the subject since. But in limiting himself to this supreme concept he in effect comments on and rejects his former proof. It seems to me a pity that his commentator does not display the same candour and recognise that the ontotheological proof is not just defective, but radically mistaken. Comment on Laberge's treatment of the remaining arguments must be much briefer. Little need be said about his handling of the 'Cartesian1 and 'Wolffian' proofs, i.e. what the Critique calls the Ontological and Cosmological Arguments, which are presented in the limited context Kant 727</page><page sequence="6">W. H. Walsh envisages and hence are not discussed for their own sake. Laberge does not ask what existence is if it is not a predicate, nor does he enquire to what extent the first cause argument is empirical: he simply goes along with his author on these points. He is more critical, and hence more interesting, on the various forms of the argument from design. In the Allgemeine Naturgeschichte Kant attempted to base his entire case for affirming God's existence on evidence of order and design; what makes his advocacy worth notice is that, unlike more orthodox supporters of the design argument, he positively welcomes the spread of mechanical explanations, on the ground that a mechanism which can produce results that conduce to the welfare of rational beings must itself bear witness to a benevolent creator. It was in this connection that Kant introduced his sketch of a possible mechanical account of the origins of the universe; as Laberge says, he was here arguing against Newton, though at the same time refusing to join forces with Epicurus in making everthing depend on chance. The whole episode has an extra-ordinarily antiquated air when considered today; Laberge perhaps neglects to ask enough questions about how the theory is supposed to work out in detail (at what point precisely does teleology have to supplement mechanism?), but has no difficulty in pointing to arbitrary elements and internal weaknesses in Kant's account. The design argument is only marginal in the Nova Dilucidatio but again plays a big part in the Beweisgrund, where however it appears in the guise of a supplementary proof aimed at persuasion, rather than a complete demonstration on its own. Laberge shows that Kant is treating much the same material as in his earlier work, but doing so with far greater sophistication, drawing conclusions which are less bold but also easier to defend. He might with advantage have paid more attention to what is involved in Kant's notion of 'improved' teleology, instead of concentrating on the use to which Kant puts it; he might also have asked, in the light of this material, just how much Kant took from Hume in his final treatment of the argument from design. But what he says is, as it stands, obviously based on thorough knowledge and patient analysis. A philosophical reader may not find in it all he wants, but he will certainly find much that is clear and instructive. In general, Laberge writes well and makes his points with exemplary clarity. As a contribution to the history of thought his work has solid merits; it deserves to stand alongside the studies by Henrich, Schmucker and others cited in the bibliography. Anyone who wants to know what lay behind the chapter on the Ideal in the first Critique, and indeed the incidental remarks there (like the one about belief in an author of the world being generated solely by observation of 'the glorious order, beauty and providential care everywhere displayed in nature'), will do well to consult it. In my view it is not free from faults, in so far as its author seems to overvalue Kant's earlier thought and undervalue, or at least play 728</page><page sequence="7">Laberge, Théologie Précritique Kantienne down, the achievements of the critical period. Of course it is splendid that we should recover Kant's pre-critical ideas, even though he apparently thought little of them himself: they are important both for themselves and for the light they throw on his later views. But if we do undertake this task we must recognise frankly that though Kant made tremendous advances during this period, he also made a number of serious mistakes, and held a general position which is plainly untenable. The Critique of Pure Reason represents a position which may not be tenable either, and is certainly not free from mistakes. But the position is one which remains a live option for philosophers, and the mistakes are sometimes the mistakes of genius. W. H. WALSH University of Edinburgh September 7974 729</page></plain_text>
