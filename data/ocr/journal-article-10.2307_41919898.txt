<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indian Anthropologist (200 1)31 : 2, 69-74 69 Short Note Tribal Arts and Crafts: A Study among the Tharu of Uttar Pradesh Sameera Maiti In today's world of scientific and technological advancement, one rarely gives serious thought to aspects of culture that are not considered indicators of development and progress . One such aspect, that has not drawn much attention from anthropologists despite its known importance are the artistic activities of various societies. Arts and crafts form an important subject of study since they act as a mirror to reflect upon the people who produce it. Art is, and has always been, an indispensable need of humanity. It is the art of each community that gives it a district character and rhythm. It acts as a representative of every society's tradition and cultural heritage since cultural patterning and meaning lay at the bottom of art. Thus, life and art are closely and inseparably interwoven, but life passes- the life of individuals and the life of nations- and art remains. The Tharu are the largest of the five Scheduled Tribes of undivided Uttar Pradesh. At present they are the only one remaining after the separation of Uttaranchal from the State. The Tharu are spread over a vast tract at the Indo-Nepal border and inhabit the districts of Lakhimpur-Kheri, Gonda, Bahraich and Gorakhpur in the State. They are also found in parts of SAMEERA MAITI, Department, of Anthropology, University of Lucknow, Lucknow</page><page sequence="2">70 TRIBAL ARTS AND CRAFTS... ' Uttaranchal, Bihar, Bengal, Assam and Nepal. According to the 1991 Census their total population in U.P. was only 1,18,558, of this 28,856 were to be found in Lakhimpur-Kheri. According to a survey conducted by the Integrated Tribal Development Programme (ITDP) at Kheri in December 1998, their population in the district was almost 32, 100. The Tharu who belong to the Mongoloid race, on the basis of their physical characteristics, claim to be of Rajput descent from their mother's side although they have not ypt been able to put forward any concrete proof for this belief of theirs. The Tharu are a patrilineal and patrilocal group, with the eldest male member as the head of the family, though women play an equally dominant role. Tradition supports joint families, although today nuclear families are on a rise. Agriculture constitutes the pivot of their economy aided by fishing, occasional hunting and animal husbandry. Besides, supplementary occupations such as construction and repair of houses, basketry, pottery, net, mat and rope making keep the Tharu busy during the lull periods of agricultural work. Members of a joint family hold the agricultural land in joint ownership. Apart from this, other household objects such as fishing nets and traps, agricultural implements, utensils, furniture, etc. are commonly owned. As such, no sale proceedings can be finalised without the consent of other members in the family. The Tharu have retained much of their self-sufficiency over the years as far as their economic needs are concerned. However, there remain a few articles that have to be purchased from the market. Culture contact has brought about a change of view among the Tharus towards supernatural elements. Today apart from the indigenous deities and spectral being, the Tharu have included in their pantheon several Hindu gods and goddesses and Muslim saints. The Bharra is the medicine-man cum priest among the Tharu. Thus apart from propitiating the deities and spirits he also provides herbs, sacrifices and offerings to rid one of their ailments. Most of the Tharu religious rituals, fasts and festivals revolve around their main economic activity, i.e. agriculture, since the interval between sowing and harvesting involves several risks and dangers. Holi is the main festival, which calls for a lot of merry making among them. Satti (purification rites) held on the sixth day after child birth, màngni (engagement), marriage, roti - pani and ghara or barshi (death rituals) are the main life cycle rituals observed by the Tharus. Once declared a Scheduled Tribe in 1967, the government began to take several measures for the all round development of the Tharus. In this direction, several economic upliftment, health improvement, educational, family planning, etc. schemes have been started the results of which are beginning to show, though slowly.</page><page sequence="3">Indian Anthropologist (200 1)31 : 2, 69-74 7 1 Most studies on the Tharu have been carried out in the field of Physical Anthropology, some on the general socio-cultural aspects of their life and a few on their psychological. One fascinating aspect of the Tharu life that has barely been touched upon in these studies is that of their art and craft. Keeping this in mind, the present paper attempt to touch upon the rich cultural heritage of Tharu arts and crafts. The present paper is based on data collected through indepth interviews and observation on the three sub-groups residing in Lakhimpur- Kheri district. Art for the Tharu, is a part of life not separate from it and their love for art and beauty can easily be noticed by the fact that most of their daily use objects are lavished with various forms of beautification. Art, thus , is interwoven into nearly every aspect of Tharu life. As soon as one steps into a Tharu village, the first thing to strike one are the beautiful Tharu huts or tharuhat . Constructed by the tribais themselves, the huts are made of wood, reed, bamboo, thatch and clay, all of which are acquired from the vicinity &amp; nearby forest area. The walls of these hutments are decorated in various ways. Some Rana Tharu houses have beautifully designed openings of various shapes which serve as ventilators/ windows and also beautify the house. For decoration, while the walls are being plastered naha mud frame are invariably made on the front walls and one has the choice of making paintings, engraving or embossments on these. Embossing or causing the pattern to stand out is the traditional from of decorating the huts although engraving and painting are not uncommon. Mirror pieces of various shapes are sometimes afixed on these patterns to further enhance its beauty. Once dried, these patterns are coloured with either with natural colours such as ochre, chalk and yellow day, or with chemical colours easily available in the market. The common designs noted for mural are art geometric and floral designs, although animal, birds and anthropomorphic figures are not uncommon. Sceneries, hearts and words such as ' Welcome', ' Swagat , Jai Matadi 4 and ' Jai Jawan ' seem to be the latest addition. Another important use that clay is put to by the Tharu is in the making of varied products such as huge grain bins, containers, receptacles, pens for housing poultry, hearths, toys and stands of different shapes. All these items are hand made without the help of a potters wheel and baked in the sun instead of being fired. Some of these clay articles are also extensively beautified by engraving and embossing in a way quite similar to their hutments. The most extensively decorated among these are the grain bins. The huge storage bin, hearth and stands are the other objects that are frequently beautified. There is no special significance associated with any particular design, though a few motifs such as triangles, flowers and a few birds are considered auspicious. Apart from these abstract designs human &amp; animals</page><page sequence="4">72 TRIBAL ARTS AND CRAFTS... figures are generally shaped. Rampant use and preference for natural colours over chemical colours is noted because of the longer life span of natural colours. A remarkable fact about the clay work of the Tharu, that adds to its beauty, is the sureness with which these people shape their vessels. Not only do the Tharu achieve a perfect form without the use of any measuring device, but they also shape these articles in such a way as to make them objects of aesthetic as well as utilitarian value. Among the most beautiful pieces of native craftsmanship, which one can admire during even a casual stroll through a Tharu village, are the different kinds of fishing nets, mats, colourful and decorated baskets, hand fans, bags, etc. which the tribais turn out with great neatness and accuracy. The Tharu excel in the art of basketry and its related crafts. The manipulation of different materials in making these articles and the various designs woven on them spell out their skill in using natural materials available in the vicinity with efficacy and shows the extent to which the Tharu have mastered these crafts for their use. The ceremonial baskets are containers of exquistie shape &amp; smoothness, most of which are beautified with geometrical designs achieved by the use of additional multicoloured material and, decorated further with accessories such as beads, conch, shells, woollen balls- etc. Apart from baskets, the intricately coiled and twilled colourful hand fans are specimen of the Tharu love for colour and fine designs. The most popular motifs coiled on these are zig-zag lines, diamonds, triangles änd other angular patterns. Floral, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic pattern, though not very commonly noted, are also found and are more or less in geometric form. There are no patent rights recognized by the Tharus so far as designs are concerned and there is no prohibition regarding the introduction of new patterns or techniques. Whoever sees the finished ceremonial baskets and hand fans will be impressed with the regularity, smoothness and neatness of its texture which has all the fine qualities of delicate handwork. The Tharu women's attire is embellished extensively with a combination of embroidery applique and patchwork all of which have their own distinctive style. Kasida is the traditional style of embroidery similar to satin stitch. Mainly geometric designs are brought out although innovative non geometric designs are also gradually becoming common. Several variations of a few- basic designs are made, most of which are quite abstract and in accordance to personal taste. Formerly silken or cotton threads were used for this purpose, however now a days bright coloured woolen strands are utilized. Patch worked pieces are further worked upon with intricate leharia applique. The uniqueness of Tharu applique is the fineness with which it is done and the pronounced effect that is brought out. Motifs are always cut on a white cloth and stitched on to a dark coloured background. Variations of a few prototype designs are mainly noted. These features of the</page><page sequence="5">Indian Anthropologist (200 1)31 : 2, 69-74 73 applique distinguish it from similar work carried out elsewhere, viz, western U.P., Rajasthan &amp; Gujart. The high quality workmanship of these crafts can also be derived from the fact that it takes days to make even a small piece. The beauty of the Tharu attire is further heightened by the addition of mirror pieces, beads, shells, bright coloured woollen balls and other accessories. The Tharu performing arts may not be technically of a high standard but they are rich in their expression of the innermost feelings of the simple Tharu heart. Song, dance and music are often combined to reinforce one another. The best preserved among these are the traditional songs which are one of the richest treasures of the Tharu culture. Songs appropriate for every occasion, be it mourning or celebration, exist. Use of musical instruments in found, but only as accompaniments to dancing and singing. Musical instruments are mainly percussion ones that provide rhythm while melody is provided by the voice of the singer Dances are performed mainly in groups during the Holi festival whereas songs are sung both in chorus and solo whenever one desire for the same. The Tharu dance though not vibrant and lively, has gained a lot of popularity in and around the Tarai area. This is mainly because of the dazzling multicoloured attire and heavy jewellery worn by the women at the time of performances. A mere description cannot do full justice to the Tharu performing arts since these are expression of aesthetic experience through rhythmic body movements by conscious and orderly manipulation in time, space, tone and melody. In this case an aesthetic mind and quality of appreciation is absolutely necessary to understand the underlying implication of the tribal performing arts and to fathom the depth of its beauty and grace. There may be a few people who would disagree in considering the mentioned activities artistic or aesthetically inclined. The fact that the products through which these people reflect their artistic temperament are first of all functional and utilitarian cannot be denied. But, it may be mentioned here that it is possible to have two distinctly different mental responses to these. Such objects may merely be considered effective in fulfilling some requirement and thus considered simply utilitarian, or they may be admired in an aesthetic way. As a thing of grace they appeal to our aesthetic sensibility and therefore belong to the realm of art. There is no doubt that the Tharu huts, clay objects, basketry items, etc. primarily are utilitarian in nature, but they are also works of art. It seems that the Tharus can hardly fashion these articles without attempting to impart to the form or shape something of the quality we refer to as 'aesthetic'. Function can only vaguely determine the final form of any object, since these will be functional even without a fine finish. The final form of these objects is thus created keeping in mind both function and aesthetic sensibility.</page><page sequence="6">74 TRIBAL ARTS AND CRAFTS... Today all over the world one can observe the dying of old artisanship and true hadicraft. Even the Tharu are no longer an isolated lot as they had been till the recent past. The impact of urbanization and fast developing cosmopolitan culture can be noticed in every sphere of their life including their attitude towards arts and artistic pursuits. Over the decade, the beautiful Tharu huts have fast been replaced by those made of bricks and cement which lack the beautiful mural art of the traditional Tharu huts. In place of the clay vessels and exquisitely woven and decorated baskets, more and more plastic and metal containers are being used. The use of electric and plastic hand fans bought from the market are fast replacing the painstakingly coiled or woven traditional ones. The switch over to the urban style of dressing and adorning in place of the beautifully worked Tharu attire and their heavy jewellery; the preference being given to Hindi film songs, music and dance particularly by the younger generation instead of the traditional Tharu performing arts - all signify a change that is taking place in the culture of the Tharus. A materialistic attitude is fast replacing the simple and leisurely life of these tribais. In an attempt to attain economic prosperity, preference is being given to activities that help in generating wealth. Thus, creative urges are being suppressed to a great extent. Many Tharu today consider artistic activities such as coiling beautiful baskets and fans or doing the exclusive embroidery and applique a waste of their precious time and energy that can otherwise be put to some economically gainful work. This change, though occuring at a fast pace, is at its initial stage. Even today skilled craft persons and artists are respected and admired by other members of the community. Till date objects of beauty are considered priced possessions and much free time is spent in deriving aesthetic pleasure by trying their hands at creating something innovative and artistic. On the whole, it is derived that the Tharu have developed a taste and preference for modern day articles easily available in the surrounding markets. This has further had a dampening effect even on those who still relish to try their hands at making something innovative and artistic during their leisure time. Ultimately this change is reflected both in quantity as well as in quality. It is a pity that the exceptional and unique Tharu arts and crafts are on a decline today. Under such conditions governmental and dedicated non governmental organizations should come forward to initiate programmes with the help of the Tharus which encourage and develop their traditional arts and crafts. In this process the organizations would not only help preserve and perpetuate the indigenous tribal arts and crafts that have their very own distinctive feature and exquisite style, but also help the Tharu add to their economic prosperity.
