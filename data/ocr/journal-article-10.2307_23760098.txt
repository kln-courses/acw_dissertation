Without consid ering the bulk of crudely carved pièces, stylistic variety in this large group is evident though poorly understood. Compact treatment and realistic features, combined with specific élé ments of dress and ornament characterize most of the elabó rate anthropomorphic sculptures. This is true also for the relatively small and rather flat figure of a kneeling female, whose left hand rests on the left knee while the part of the sculpture formerly showing the right hand and knee is missing. The bare feet bent back with toes touching are visible at the rear. Head and headdress contrast in their size with the compressed remainder of the figure. The short body is cover ed by a broad, V-shaped band fringed with tassels, represent ing the triangular shawl-like quechquemitl, the ritual female garment originating on the Gulf Coast but associated with Central Mexican fertility goddesses in the Late Postclassic. The headband shows horizontally arranged feathers. Pendants similar to snake heads are fastened in the centre of the ear disks. Attached to the nape of the neck, the female is wearing a pleated bark paper ornament, amacuexpalli, an attribute of mountain, rain and water deities promoting agri cultural fertility. Beneath the paper bow plain open hair extends down the back and to the sides of the figure. This appear to be the image of an Aztec fertility goddess, an example of the most popular group deities in Aztec Mexico, possibly a représentation of the water goddess Chal chihuitlicue. The sculpture of unknown provenance can be traced back to the Berlin art market in 1956 (Gerd Rosen Auktionen). Later on it was in the possession of the Berlin americanist Gerdt Kutscher who lent it to the great Mexican exhibition in Munich and in Berlin for which he also prepared the respec tive catalogues (Präkolumbische Kunst aus Mexiko und Mit telamerika, Haus der Kunst München, Oktober bis Dezember 1958, No. 97; Kunst aus Mexiko und Mittelamerika, Akademie der Künste Berlin, Oktober bis November 1959, No. 1036). Now the sculpture forms part of another private collection in Berlin. Volcanic stone with traces of red paint. Height 25.6 cm, width 17 cm, depth 9 cm. Text: Ulf Bankmann.
