<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin H. D. Buchloh Michael Asher and the Conclusion of Modernist Sculpture Concrete material reality and social meaning should always be the primary criteria of specifica- tion. Before all else, we see in ideological objects various connections between meaning and its material body. This connection may be more or less deep and organic. For instance, the meaning of art is completely inseparable from all the details of its material body. The work of art is meaningful in its entirety. The very constructing of the body-sign has a primary impor- tance in this instance. Technically auxiliary and therefore replaceable elements are held to a minimum. The individual reality of the object, with all the uniqueness of its features, acquires artistic meaning here.1 Sculpture traditionally differed from painting through its seemingly unquestionable three- dimensionality, its physical and physiological corporeality. Sculpture was defined almost as literal embodiment of the artist's subjective plastic concerns, determined by the objective aesthetic and practical conditions of the sculptural discourse at hand to implement and concre- tize these concerns, and the spectator's (often the patron's) willingness and ability to recognize his existential being-in-the-world in the sculptural embodiment and representation. Or, as Rosalind Krauss recently stated in an appropriate academic definition: "The logic of sculpture, it would seem, is inseparable from the logic of the monument. By virtue of this logic a sculpture is a commemorative representation. It sits in a particular place and speaks in a symbolical tongue about the meaning and the use of that place."2 As we will be dealing in the following with some historical aspects of contemporary sculptural works in general, and with two works that were executed by Michael Asher in 1979 for two museums in Chicago in particular, it seems appropriate to consider these works in sculptural terms, as they do in fact "[sit] in a particular place and [speak] in a symbolical tongue about the meaning and the use of that place." To achieve, however, an adequate reading of the complexity of the works in question, and the material and procedural transfor- mations that have taken place in the evolution of contemporary sculpture, and to come to an understanding of the consequences and repercussions following from these works, it is neces- sary to recapitulate briefly some of the crucial changes that define sculpture in the history of modernism. Looking at the concrete material reality of modernist sculpture (that is, its materials and its procedures of production) as well as looking at its rapidly changing history of appreciation and -See figs. 1 and 2. 277</page><page sequence="2">rr" 110 OW, --7 -/ - II I __ I ' -` ...C i_ illll _ I--- i- lllt~C I _If J</page><page sequence="3">reception, one could almost come to the conclusion that sculpture, due to its plastic and concrete "nature" more than any other art practice, seems to lend itself to a particularly obdurate discourse of aesthetic ideology: how to maintain and continue atavistic production modes (modeling, carving, casting, cutting, welding) and apply them convincingly to semi- precious or so-called "natural" materials (bronze, marble, wood) under the conditions of a highly industrialized society. Only twenty years ago (if not more recently) the works of Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore could still pass as the epitome of the sculptural, where in fact their archaic iconography and plastic appearance revealed hardly more (but also no less) than the author's (and the public's) ossified insistence on maintaining a discourse that had lost its historic authenticity and credibility in the first decade of this century. Even a practicing academic sculptor and sculpture-historian, William Tucker, seemed to acknowledge the specific dilemma of his own discipline, however, without coming to an adequate understanding of the historical conditions that determine the dilemma of that cate- gory, when commenting on Rodin as follows: Thus, Rodin's mature sculpture follows the effective emergence of modern painting, moreover, in comparison with the directness, simplicity, and objectivity of the new painting. The state- ment in sculpture seems tentative, half-formed and weighed down by a burden of romantic and dramatic subject matter of moral and public "function" which the Impressionists had been able to jettison from the first. The reasons for the late arrival and confused intentions of the new sculpture lie partly in the physical character of sculpture and painting, partly in the relative development in Europe since the Renaissance, partly in the specific conditions of patronage and public taste which were obtained in 19th century France. Sculpture became an art in which the taste and ambition of the public patron became the determining factor, and virtuosity and craftsmanship the criteria of artistic achievement.3 A more rigorously analytical reading of the history of modernist sculpture would have to acknowledge that most of its seemingly eternal paradigms, which had been valid to some extent in late nineteenth-century sculpture (i.e., the representation of individual, anthropomor- phic, wholistic bodies in space, made of inert but lasting, if not eternal, matter and imbued with illusionary moments of spurious life), had been definitely abolished by 1913. Tatlin's corner-counter relief and his subsequent Monument for the Third International and Duchamp's "ready-mades," both springing off the height of Synthetic Cubism, constitute since then the extremes of an axis on which sculpture has been resting ever since (knowingly or not): the dialectics of sculpture between functioning as a model for the aesthetic production of reality (e.g., architecture and design) or serving as a model investigating and contemplating the reality of aesthetic production (the ready-made, the allegory). Or, more precisely: architecture on the one hand and epistemological model on the other are the two poles toward which relevant sculpture since then has tended to develop, each implying the eventual dissolution of its own discourse as sculpture. This ambiguous transition of the discipline had been sensed as early as 1903 by the conservative poet Rilke in his Rodin study, but of course his sense was conveyed in a tone of deploration and lament as the withering artistic category was indicative of vanish- ing privileges and esoteric experiences, which he perceived as being incorporated in the wholis- tic, autonomous art object: Sculpture was a separate thing, as was the easel picture, but it did not require a wall like the 278</page><page sequence="4">picture. It did not even need a roof. It was an object that could exist for itself alone, and it was well to give it entirely the character of a complete thing about which one could walk, and which one could look at from all sides. And yet it had to distinguish itself somehow from other things, the ordinary things which everyone could touch.4 The threshold between symbolic space and actual space, the ambiguous shift between functional object and aesthetic object, demonstrates the lines between which Michael Asher's works operate with increasingly analytical precision, deconstructing our notions of the sculp- tural as though they would want to prove that sculpture as a category has lost its material and historical legitimacy. I Sculptural materiality before or beyond its iconic, formal, or procedural definitions has to be considered as a symbolic system that is highly overdetermined. For example, we cannot help but suspect that the "nobility" of bronze and marble in the late nineteenth-century work of Rodin was at least in part a result of his dependence on the class of bourgeois fin-de-siecle nouveaux riches which supported him and that these materials fulfilled this audience's desire for "nobilization" of the material world as much as they fulfilled Rodin's "aesthetic" needs. If the real interests of a society at a given historical moment are based, for example, on the speculation with real estate, heavy industry, and the founding of canons, then the aesthetic sculptural representation that would best and necessarily function as the "disinterested" and "purposeless as such" might well turn out to be luscious white marble and bronze. Therefore, symbolic determinations of sculptural materials do not only result from the author's profes- sional idiosyncrasies-whether his individual psychosexual organization tends more toward modeling soft and palpable masses (like clay) or whether he feels like cutting stone or carving wood-but they also result from the audience's expectations. Another point to consider is whether the specific material and the procedures of its production do attract and allow for a projective identification and seem in fact to embody the viewer's physical being in the world. Quite obviously, then, this being in the world in the material terms of three-dimensional representation of voluminous masses and bodies would refract and reflect in various manners the means and procedures of production of this material world itself, inasmuch as they condi- tion author and audience of sculpture alike. In contradistinction to Rodin, to give another example, the truly radical modernity of Medardo Rosso's sculptures resisted this incorporation into bronze in most of his works and the sculptural production process itself was arrested and fragmented at the level of the wax and plaster model: materials that by their very nature quite explicitly reject any heroic or sublime connotations. Rosso often said that he wanted the materials of his sculptures to pass unnoticed because they were meant to blend with the unity of the world that surrounded them. The actual fragmentation of the sculptural procedure-whether deliberate or circumstantial-corre- sponds as a plastic and historical fact to Rosso's fragmentation of the sculptural representations themselves. His reluctance or incapacity to fulfill all the requirements of the traditional sculp- tural production process, from modeling to casting, indicates an essential critical shift of attitude. It reveals the increasing doubts about the ability of a practice of artisan-oriented sculpture to come to terms with its historic reality: The completion of various steps and 279</page><page sequence="5">sequences of production activities, pretending to be conceived and executed by one individual, had become obsolete. Along with the fragmentation of the sculptural procedures appeared the phenomenon of a heterogeneous materiality: Prefabricated elements, alien to the craft of nine- teenth-century sculpture, were introduced or intruded into the conventionally unitary sculp- tural body. Little Dancer of Fourteen (1881), the only sculpture by Edgar Degas that was publicly exhibited during his lifetime and cast in bronze posthumously, produced this modern- ist scandal for the first time. When it was exhibited at the Exposition des Independents in 1881, Joris Huysmans hailed it as follows: At once refined and barbaric with her industrious costume.and her colored flesh which palpi- tates furrowed by the work of the muscles, this statue is the only truly modern attempt I know in sculpture.5 Both phenomena-the fragmentation of representation and of the production process and the juxtaposition of heterogeneous materials-emerge as the dominant phenomena of mod- ernist sculpture. At first they appeared accidentally, as in the case of Degas, but in Cubism and Futurism the combination of mechanically prodcced anonymous objects and fragments with individually produced aesthetic signs became a quintessential production procedure, resulting ultimately, it would seem, in the final takeover of the aesthetic construct by the mechanically produced object in Duchamp's ready-mades. These phenomena receive a meticulous descrip- tion and precise historical analysis in Georg Lukacs's attempt to define the conditions of reification in I928: Rationalization in the sense of being able to predict with every greater precision all the results to be achieved is only to be acquired by the exact breakdown of every complex into its elements and by the study of the special laws governing production. Accordingly, it must declare war on the organic manufacture of whole products based on the traditional amalgam of empirical experiences of work. . . . The finished article ceases to be the object of the work process. . . . This destroys the organic necessity with which interrelated special operations are unified in the end product. Neither objectively nor in his relation to his work does man appear as the authentic master of the process: on the contrary, he is a mechanical part incorporated into a mechanical system. He finds it already preexistent and self-sufficient; it functions independently of him and he has to conform to its laws whether he likes it or not. As labour is progressively rationalized and mechanized, his lack of will is reinforced by the way in which his activity becomes less and less active and more and more contemplative. The contemplative stance adopted toward a process mechanically conforming to fixed laws and enacted independently of man's consciousness and impervious to human intervention, i.e., a perfectly closed system, must likewise transform the basic categories of man's immediate attitude to the world: It reduces space and time to a common denominator and degrades time to the dimension of space.6 The intrusion of those alien materials in Degas's sculpture established a very precarious balance between the subjective aesthetic creation and the factors of given objective reality along the lines pointed out by Lukacs. Ever since, and most definitely since Duchamp's "ready- mades," these historical conditions have been forced to their most logical and radical extreme. Duchamp's work features most prominently that contemplative character of spatialized time in 280</page><page sequence="6">Figure I.

Quite amazingly, a totally opposite reading of Duchamp as the artist who continues and accomplishes the nineteenth-century tradition of the dandy, the artist who refuses participation in the collective production process and inverts his role as procreator into that of the divine blase, the flaneur who simply walks around the world and designates found objects as art-this reading converges precisely with the above observation, as the arrest of temporal flux and passive contemplation are the modes in which the melan- cholic perceives the world and the increasing estrangement from it. Inevitably, at this point, Walter Benjamin's observation on the interaction between alle- gory and commodity has to be quoted: "The devaluation of the world of objects by the allegory is exceeded within the world of objects itself by the commodity."'7 From the first decade of the twentieth century on, the precarious ambiguity between the apparent autonomy of sculptural constructs and the socially determined conditions of material production, between aesthetic object and symbolic space on the one hand and real object and actual space on the other, has determined the practice of sculpture. Not always, however, does aesthetic production evolve logically according to its own inherent historical necessities and in response to the change of the conditions of material production. Quite to the contrary, it seems that one of the essential features of aesthetic production-at least in twentieth-century art history-is the constant reiteration of the same problems and contradictions according to the law of compulsive repetition.8 As the contradic- tions which are objectively anchored in the organization of the means of production obviously cannot be resolved aesthetically, every generational or period stratum within the continuity of an obsolete form of production assumes increasingly mythical and ideological qualities and functions as opposed to the truly aesthetic. The history of post-World War II sculpture is particularly rich with these myths, and only one of the most spectacular ones should be briefly discussed as an example and historic link: that in which the issues of Constructivism's and Dada's attitudes toward the mass-pro- duced object seem to coalesce, as, for example, in the work of David Smith, John Chamber- lain, and Anthony Caro. If anything, the welding of metal and junk sculpture in their work seems to resolve in a most comforting manner that blatant contradiction between individual aesthetic production and collective social production, that between construction and found object. In fact, however, this contradiction is also mythified by the work's seeming synthesis of the heroic gesture of construction and creation and the melancholic gesture of denial and negation. In the same way, these artists, as public figures and biographical myths, combine the image of the proletarian producer, taming the elements and extracting wealth from the furnace, with that of the melancholic stroller in the junkyards of capitalist technology-an image that has persisted right into the present in figures like Carl Andre and Richard Serra. The necessarily fetishistic character of this work had been adequately diagnosed in the 1920s by the Russian productivist artist and theoretician Boris Arvatov, who wrote in Kunst und Producktion: While the totality of capitalist technology is based on the highest and latest achievements and represents a technique of mass production (industry, radio, transport, newspaper, scientific laboratory), bourgeois art in principle has remained on the level of individual crafts and there- fore has been isolated increasingly from the collective social practice of mankind, has entered the realm of pure aesthetics. The lonely master-that is the only type in capitalist society, the type 282</page><page sequence="8">of specialist of "pure art"-who can work outside of an immediately utilitarian practice, because it is based on machine technology. From here originates the total illusion of art's purposelessness and autonomy, from here art's bourgeois fetishistic nature.9 As for the mythology and meaning of materials and production procedures, scrap-metal/ assemblage sculpture and the welding technique concretize the historic dilemma between obsolescent means of aesthetic production and their romanticization (i.e., fetishization) on the one hand and the advanced means of social production on the other, as well as they embody the attempt to solve this historical dilemma. The failure of that attempt, inasmuch as it becomes evident in the work itself, is then the work's historic and aesthetic authenticity. Julio Gonzalez, who had been trained as a stonecutter, learned welding in the French Renault car factories during World War I and integrated his enforced experience from alienated labor in social production into his individual aesthetic production. Or, from a different point of view, one could argue that he adapted his aesthetic procedures to the experience of collective production procedures. This "modernization" of the sculptural discourse was instantly suc- cessful because it seemed to respond to and fulfill the needs of a disposition within artist and public at the moment to achieve at least a symbolic reconciliation of the increasingly apparent contradictions. Picasso adopted this technique in the early 1920os, and a new sculptural category and production technique was born. When David Smith "discovered" Gonzalez's and Picasso's work through the mediation of the art magazine Cahiers d'Art and imported the technique to North America, a further crucial step in the mythification of that simple sculptural procedure, which had originated from Cubism's necessity to assemble planes in various spatial positions and directions, had taken place. Smith, more than Gonzalez, pro- pounded the image of the proletarian producer, linking it with the mythical Hephaistos/Vul- can figure. On frequent occasions he pointed to the immensely important experiences of factory labor that shaped and determined his work, in particular his experience as a welder in a World War II tank factory. He referred to his welded sculptures as constructions of the same historical order as locomotives. To what degree this self-image of the welding-mask- weaving proletarian/producer and twentieth-century Vulcan possessed mythical attraction for David Smith is hinted at by the fact that his widow has revealed that most of Smith's claim for severe and enduring experiences as a factory welder, in fact, were exaggerated.10 The next step of aesthetic removal and mythification occurred when this modernized sculptural production procedure was "rediscovered" and "reimported" to Europe by Anthony Caro in I960 upon his first visit to North America and his encounter with David Smith. His radically superficial overnight shift (as in the radical superficiality of changes in the discourse of fashion) from his figurative bronze casting to nonrepresentational welded assemblage sculp- tures made of scrap metal, and his subsequent step to investigate the decorative potential of gaudily painted arrangements of metalwork samples, accomplished historically the aesthetic falsification and "cultural" inversion of everything that constructivist ideas had originally intended and achieved within their limited political possibilities. It took artists of the minimal and post-minimal generation like Carl Andre and Richard Serra in the mid- and late 1960s to literally "decompose" these mythified construction tech- niques, materials, and production procedures. The aesthetic shock and subsequent relief that their work might have caused originally resulted precisely from the deconstruction of sculp- 283</page><page sequence="9">ture, the perseverance of singularized, particular elements, clarification of the constituent forces within the sculptural construct, and the transparence of the production procedures evident in their work. It is symptomatic in this context that Serra referred to the technique of welding as "stitching" during the I960s and that he readopted that very same technique when his work in the 1970s returned to the mythification of the constructivist legacy to allow for a pretense to public monumental sculpture. Ever since the first decade of this century, radical sculpture has increased the fragmenta- tion of the sculptural production process itself, as well as it has intensified the reflection on the constituent factors determining this process. Internally, the material elements assembling the sculptural phenomenon have become increasingly isolated, singularized, and specific; and the procedures of its fabrication as well as the physical laws and forces allowing or generat- ing its appearance in space have become more and more the center of the sculptural investigation. Externally, an analysis of the perceptual relations that connect the sculptural object with the perpetual acts of the subject is incorporated into the very conception and formation of the sculpture. Necessarily resulting from this is an increased and systematic reflection of the interdependence and interrelationships of the sculpture and its surrounding spatial/architectural container. II The emergence in sculpture of the I96os of minimal and post-minimal aesthetics, which form the historical context out of which Michael Asher's work developed, constitutes a major period of modernist sculptural history. Despite numerous and reiterated affirmations by American critics and historians that minimal and post-minimal works are not to be seen in the historical context of modernist sculpture pointed out above, the contrary holds true: too frequent are the references by the artists themselves, implicitly and explicitly, given in works and statements, that acknowledge the rediscovery of plastic principles and theoretical positions which had been articulated in Duchamp's work on the one hand, and in that of the Construc- tivists on the other (for example, Andre on Rodchenko, Judd on Duchamp and Malevich, Flavin on Tatlin, and Morris on Duchamp). This was precisely the part of the modernist tradition that had been ignored and rejected by the normative aesthetics of Greenberg's formal- ist "new criticism," which, even though debated and questioned, provided another essential element of the critical foundation against which the new sculptural work could be defined. In addition to this new positivist approach and the discovery of Merleau-Ponty's recently (1965) translated Phenomenology of Perception, we see a laconic pragmatism resulting from what Moira Roth has called appropriately The Aesthetics of Indifference, from a sceptical investigation into the epistemology of painterly and sculptural signs, and from artists' discovery of logical positivism and semiology. It comes, too, from an ideology of anti-expression (questioning subjective meaning or existential meaning in general), that seemed to have dominated the preceding decade. Stella's famous statement "What you see is what you see" is a lapidary condensation of all these elements. The formalist concept of "self-referentiality" is the more theoretical prescription by which art until around I965 had to abide. What in fact amounted to a pictorial or sculptural analogy to the semiological understanding of the sign, its state of being constituted by two different elements-signifier and signified-that were arbitrarily connected, as Saussure had claimed in 284</page><page sequence="10">1913 in his "Cours de linguistique g6nerale," and the self-reflexivity resulting from that analogy in artistic production, again in principle, if not in explicit theoretical reflections, had been achieved by both Duchamp and Malevich in 1913. One of the first minimal works to expand the notion of self-referentiality to a considerable degree was Robert Morris's Mirrored Cubes (1964-65). It found its parallel on the West Coast in the early mirrored cubes of Larry Bell. Both refer explicitly to an unexecuted project by Duchamp, defined in the Green Box,,1 suggesting the placement of mirrored cubes on the floor of a room. Asher went to New York for a year in 1963-64. He became very interested in Flavin's and Judd's work, and constructed tapered wedge pieces in 1966 that follow a similar logic. They were installed flush against the wall and painted over with a color identical to the wall that supported them. As in Morris's early work and Bell's mirrored cubes, the most prominent characteristic of the work is its analytical approach to the actual nature of the plastic phenome- non in its triadic context: to be aestheticallspatial sign by itself; to be relating to a larger comprehensive spatial, i.e., architectural phenomenon, which may or may not purport its own and different order of signs; and to be embedded, constituted, and activated only through the individual act of perception that the spectator introduces into the interdependence of those two systems. The sign itself, at least in Morris's early work and in Michael Asher's wedge pieces, is clearly determined by an attitude of negating its own importance. Significance other than that of distinction and demarcation between the two dimensions of individual subjective perception and objective spatial condition is denied. Dan Graham, later to become a close friend of Asher's, underwent a similar development in his work, leading gradually out of formalist and minimal aesthetics. He described his conception of an aesthetic structure as follows: "There is a 'shell' placed between the external 'empty' material of place and the interior, empty material of language: systems of information exist halfway between material and concept without being either one."12 The formalist notion of self-referentiality was replaced by an increasingly complex system of analysis that would make the work operative rather than self-reflexive. The idea of situa- tional aesthetics implied that a work would function analytically within all the parameters of its historical determination, not only in its linguistic or formal framework. This transformation had already occurred in the development of the original formalist methodology toward materi- alist semiology and productivist theory. 13 Three concepts were of crucial importance for this transgression: the notion of specificity, the notion of place, and that of presence. Donald Judd defined his understanding of specific- ity in regard to sculptural materials still with a clear innuendo toward positivist pragmatism by almost literally transferring a key term of Russian formalist criticism to sculpture. We read in his 1965 essay "Specific Objects": "Materials vary greatly and are simply materials- formica, aluminum, cold-rolled steel, plexiglass, red and common brass and so forth. They are specific. Also they are usually aggressive."14 Shortly afterwards, Michael Asher and a whole generation of artists embarked on proving that materials are not simply materials but that they are procedurally and contextually determined. As Beveridge and Burn argued against Judd: Aren't you saying you want the association to be restricted or localized to the object or its immediate (i.e., architectural) environment? Along with an autonomous form of art, you 285</page><page sequence="11">Figure 4. The Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, fagade before installation by Michael Asher (see figure 5).

Traditionally, art objects are associated with other art and art history by way of their materials and by being a conventional type of art object. Such associations would, I suppose, in your words, be specific. But this was the last thing you wanted. The autonomy you developed for your objects had to function in respect to your presupposition of an art (historical) context and hence you still needed a means of associating the object with that context. Since the object itself denied any associations, the physical situation became a more important vehicle. That is to say, the object had to be circumstantially associated with its art context. 15 The second concept-place-was mainly developed by Carl Andre and Dan Flavin.16 Andre defined sculpture as place (as opposed to object or anthropomorphic representation). Other than pointing to the spatial specificity of the sculptural work (as opposed to the material specificity that Judd talked about), Andre's definition also originally implied (as did Flavin's practice) a subversive assault on the commodity status of artworks (given that they were moveable objects, contextless, offering themselves to every kind of transaction). Sculp- ture as place was supposed to integrate into its actual formation the spatial conditions into which it inscribed itself as constituent elements. Dan Graham again observed and described this with lucidity: I liked that as a side effect of Flavin's fluorescents the gallery walls became a canvas. The lights dramatized the people (like spotlights) in a gallery, throwing the content of the exhibition out to the people in the process of perceiving; the gallery interior cube itself became the real framework.17 Quite independently, the French artist Daniel Buren wrote in 1970 an extraordinarily perspicacious critique of Duchamp's "ready-made" concept which reveals, if read along with Dan Graham's description of Flavin's work, the unreflected and problematic points of the minimalist concept of place, its unconscious indebtedness to Duchamp. He referred to pre- cisely those points that Michael Asher's work was to focus on: The Museum/Gallery for lack of being taken into consideration is the framework, the habit . . . the inescapable "support" on which art history is painted. Wishing to eliminate the tableaulsupport, on the pretext that what is painted can only be illusion, Duchamp introduces into a new framework/tableau a real object, which at the same time becomes artificial, motiveless, i.e., artistic. 18 The almost literal congruence of the two statements points to the objective nature of these artistic concerns of the post-minimal generation. Temporal specificity is defined in the third term-presence-which is closely interrelated with its spatial and material counterparts. Again the term implies not only that the sculptural installation is determined by the specific temporal circumstances into which it is introduced, but also that it obtains within these circumstances a specific, temporally limited function and is disposable after its usage in time. Again Graham had pointed this out in looking at Flavin's work when it was shown in Chicago in 1967: The components of a particular exhibition upon its termination are replaced in another situa- tion-perhaps put to a non-art use as a part of a different whole in a different future.19 287</page><page sequence="13">Figure 6.

By 1968 it had become fairly clear that the generation of minimal artists had either aban- doned the original implications of these aesthetic strategies in increasingly adapting their work again to the offers and needs of the art market-or that these aesthetic strategies in themselves had to be radically modified to maintain their status as a functional tool in the aesthetic inquiry of the historical conditions determining works of art. Michael Asher's first major one-man exhibition, in 1969 at the San Francisco Art Institute, applied the minimal principles of self-ref- erentiality and specificity in spatial and temporal terms with a vigorous directness and analytic immediacy that revealed the unreflected formalist heritage in Minimalism as much as it deter- mined a new understanding of sculptural materiality. He divided the allocated exhibition space at the San Francisco Art Institute into two halves by constructing a wall of the given exhibition panels that normally served as additional support surfaces in exhibition spaces for the installation of paintings, etc. One half of the room contained an entry/exit door and was fairly dark, because of the wall construction, while light flooded into the other half of the room through windows and a skylight. The bright half of the room was accessible only by a passage left open between the constructed and given walls. Asher described this work as follows: "The presentation at San Francisco was clearly dictated by every element which was available and it suggested a way of working for the future: using just elements which already existed without a great modification to the space."20 The very same year, in Europe, a hitherto almost totally unknown artist, Marcel Broodthaers, embarked on, as it seemed at the time, a fairly eccentric adventure: he had printed a well-designed letterhead that announced in conservative typography the foundation of a new museum in Brussels: "Musee d'Art Moderne (Section XIXe'me siecle), Departement des Aigles." He appointed himself director of this museum. The guests, among them Daniel Buren, were invited for an official opening. The official opening speech was delivered by a "real" museum director of a "real" museum in a room (Broodthaers's former "studio") filled with empty wooden picture crates that museums use for the transport of works of art, a number of art picture postcards installed on the walls, and installation equipment. Brood- thaers quite clearly had developed an awareness of the Duchamp dilemma; his seemingly eccentric activity turned out to be the beginning of a systematic analysis of the myth of the museum, its transforming capacities in the process of acculturation. As early as 1966 he pointed to the various hidden frames that determine the art object: "Every object is a victim of its nature: even in a transparent painting the color still hides the canvas and the molding hides the frame."21 As much as these two works on first observation seem to be incompatible and opposed- which is ultimately explained by the fact that they originate from opposite sources-as much do they reveal upon close analysis their actual historic connection, despite the major morpho- logical and stylistic differences that had developed between European and American art since the 1940s. To the same degree that Asher's work overcomes the neo-positivist formalism that had marked the work of the preceding generation and that had (however vulgarized and falsified) its origins partly in Constructivism-to the same degree does Broodthaers's work surmount the trap of Duchamp's "ready-made" concept that had kept almost all object-oriented art in its 289</page><page sequence="15">spell. Both positions-the constructive and the allegorical-seem to coalesce and henceforth determine the historically relevant work in contemporary art production. It is crucial to comprehend the two installations of Michael Asher at the Art Institute of Chicago (see figs. 1-3) and at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago (see figs. 4-5) in the historical perspective of sculpture (as opposed to a conceptual definition or gesture or to align, which would be even a graver misunderstanding, this work with a neo-Dada-environ- ment tradition, as has been done). Only then do these works reveal all their ramifications. As usual, a detailed and accurate formal analysis of the sculptural phenomena yields access to the works' more general historical repercussions. Asher's sculptural installations seem only to be constituted, however, by conceptual gestures, directions, decisions, and by "found" or "given" objects and materials or, more correctly, conditions and circumstances of a particular situation in a museumlexhibition context. The material of a sculptural production process in both cases is totally negated, to a degree that surpasses even the most radical conceptual definition of a sculptural process as in, for example, Lawrence Weiner's statement from 1968: "A field cratered by structured, simultaneous TNT explosions."22 The works inscribed themselves functionally into their own historical spatial context. The museum and they became the dialectical counterpart of their actual historical time, the exhibition period. It becomes apparent that their functional presence and the precision of their function were highly dependent on their actual negation of their own material presence as sculpture. What, then, are the materials of Asher's installations? Should they actually be called "sculptural" at all, or should they be considered as an application of an academic discipline- the criticism of ideology-within the field of the visual arts? Is the necessity to look at the work in sculptural terms inherent in our own system of description and classification in the traditional historical categories? We can see, however, once looking at the work in the terms of that category, to what extent it inscribes itself into the tradition of the sculptural discourse as much as it integrates itself into the actual historical, i.e., institutional, practice that propounds that discourse. Jack Burnham, in the context of Haacke's works, which deal equally with the museum and its institutional practices, has described some of the necessities for this: ...he sees the museum and gallery context as an absolutely necessary element for the meaning and functioning of his works. . . . The questions had to be asked in the galleries and the gallery public had to be confronted with its self-portrait in that same environment. The walls of the museum or gallery are as much a part of his work as the items displayed on them. These works also need the "impregnation" of the gallery to set them in opposition to other contemporary art.23 The situation in the case of Asher's work, however, is more complex: as a sculptural phenomenon these works talk in their own language about sculpture to sculpture-thus redefin- ing the terminology and commenting, as we have seen, on the present situation of the discourse. Simultaneously and paradoxically, the material terms in which Asher's work manifests itself concretely are as alien to the tradition of the sculptural discourse as they are essential to the actual constitution of the work. As we observed in the case of Degas's and Duchamp's sculptural works that shifted the paradigms of sculpture, it is precisely the degree of negation of the discipline that allows for the work's historical authenticity. Or, put differently, the almost total 290</page><page sequence="16">alienation from its conventions generates the work's identity, which in one act of double negation reveals and negates both the historical determination of itself as discourse and the conditions of historic and material reality which determine that discourse. Asher's work at the Art Institute linked and juxtaposed three different situations of display with three different experiences of visual rupture. The first was the withdrawal of a monumen- tal sculptural representation from the display system of the Art Institute's fapade, the Allerton Building on Michigan Avenue. The sculpture, a bronze cast from Jean Antoine Houdon's marble representation of George Washington from 1788, which had been installed at the main entrance in 1925, functioned as a focal sign conveying a message of national heritage with the authority of the eighteenth-century aesthetic object against the backdrop of a late nineteenth- century neo-Renaissance building. Asher proposed that as his contribution to the 73rd Ameri- can Exhibition, the sculpture should be removed from its pedestal and should be placed in its original historical context in an eighteenth-century period room (Gallery 219) containing Euro- pean paintings, furniture, and decorative arts of the eighteenth century. The sculpture was placed in the center of the gallery on a wooden base, identical in height and color to the other wooden bases in the gallery; the marble pedestal was put into storage. In this second situation of display, a reconstruction of an eighteenth-century interior, the contextualized work of sculpture caused a different rupture: Even though its bright green-blue patina almost matched the turquoise of the painted walls and some of the silk covers of the eighteenth-century furniture, it made it all the more obvious that this work had been put to a different usage in the past and had therefore acquired material features which conflicted with its definition as an object of high art in a well-guarded museum interior. Its usage as a monument made itself felt in a way that Proust once described as "the looks that objects ever have received seem to remain with them as veils." A Plexiglas box inside the gallery contained information sheets which defined the work as Michael Asher's contribution to the 73rd American Exhibition and directed the viewer to this exhibition in the Morton Wing of the museum. Downstairs, at the entrance of the 73rd American Exhibition, another box containing information sheets (see Appendix A) also gave a description of the work but directed the viewer upstairs to Gallery 219. Therefore, the visitor, who had been circulating in the survey of contemporary work that the 73rd American Exhibi- tion provided, experienced the third rupture when confronting the contextualized sculpture in Gallery 219 between the two exhibition settings and their installation. This passage through history juxtaposed suddenly a stylistically homogeneous system of conceptual and painterly artwork with the shock of an equally homogenized aesthetic code of the eighteenth century. This confrontation of a visual code of contemporaneity with that of history suddenly historicized the semblance of actuality and dynamic immediacy that contemporary works generate in the viewer's experience and directed their perspective toward the actuality of the historical dimensions in their present experience. Inasmuch as we experience visual rupture as a sensory deprivation, as a negation of expectations, the three experiences of deconstruction that we made while observing Asher's installation at the Art Institute reveal the complex synthesis of motivation that constitutes aesthetic expectation and reception in the contemporary context and comment, therefore, simultaneously on those motivations in production. Before these will be analyzed we will describe the second work, which was, as it hap- pened, installed simultaneously as a one-man exhibition of Michael Asher at the Museum of 291</page><page sequence="17">Contemporary Art. Gesturally, the two works were clearly similar: the dismantling of a given architectural display system, elements of a fagade. The Art Institute had appropriated for its fagade an eighteenth-century work of sculpture (or more precisely a twentieth-century bronze replica), and the architects of the new Museum of Contemporary Art had appropriated the stylistic idiom (or what they had perceived it to be) of minimal sculpture as a linguistic model from which they copied their modular system of architectural decoration. In the first case the appropriation of the monumental sculpture served to convey a message of national authority intertwined with historic credibility and cultural dignity (ironically, the work representing the "Father of the Country" was sculpted by a Frenchman). In the second case the appropriation of the serial modular elements of minimal sculpture was intended to convey the cultural message of a technocratic notion of progress (whether this notion was imbedded already in the idiom of minimal sculpture is disputable). As his work for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Asher stipulated (see Appendix B) that during the exhibition the two horizontal rows of aluminum panels that were in line with the Bergman Gallery windows should be removed from the fagade and placed on the interior wall of the gallery. The ten panels from the east side of the building and eight panels from the west were to be arrayed inside in the same formation and sequence, but in an actual position which was not identical to the exterior placements. In the interior installation these eighteen panels were placed sequentially as a planar relief. On the east side ten panels extended twenty-two feet along the wall; the part beginning on the west side (eight panels) extended for twenty-four feet, nine inches toward the center of the wall. This left thirty feet of unused wall space in between in which Sol Lewitt-whose work was exhibited simultaneously in a retrospective show at the Museum of Contemporary Art- executed a black wall drawing. The entire work, both its exterior elements (the withdrawn parts) and its interior elements (the displayed parts), could be viewed from the street. Once the panels were placed on the walls within the interior they became subject to the perpetual conditions that permit and determine the reading of material entities as symbolic/aes- thetic entities. Again, the juxtaposition of the exterior elements (the remaining cladding) and their semifunctional architectural usage and the interior elements (their disfunctionalized paint- erly display) resulted in a double negation of both architectural and aesthetic (painterly sculp- ture) discourse. Again, as in the work at the Art Institute, there was a third element of deconstruction: the Museum of Contemporary Art had agreed-five months prior to the first actual installation-to buy the work for its permanent collection. Therefore, a paradoxical situation occurred: once the exhibition was finished and the cladding was reinstalled in its proper place as architectural decoration, the work seemed to cease to exist while, in fact, it was put in storage on the museum's fagade, accessible to the public's view at all times, as distinct from work which is normally in storage and inaccessible. Being bound into the specific situation of the architecture, moreover, the work would cease to exist as part of the collection-thus prescribed by the contract between the artist and the museum-as soon as the architecture of the museum would be altered (at that point plans for an expansion were already being discussed). Conditions of collective reification change gradually (or, under the particular circumstances of crisis, rapidly and drastically). Their aesthetic representations appear accordingly: No longer can any object, whether individually crafted or mass-produced, reflect appropriately the degree of abstraction on which collective reification is operating and institutionalized. 292</page><page sequence="18">Art production itself has become an activity that shares the conditions of cultural industry. On the one hand, embellishing the corporate image to the public, and, on the other, depend- ing on an elaborate state support system, like cultural civil services, it helps to channel any attempt at critical negation into a hermetically sealed ideology of culture. During periods of history in which the governing powers want to convey a sense of conclu- sion (more precisely that history as process and change has been concluded), this experience of subtle oppression and stagnation is extrapolated in monumental public structures. Amnesia, the loss of memory which is at the origin of the destruction of historical dialectics, tends to incorpo- rate itself in false public commemorative representations. Their stability and weight seem to bal- ance off the insecurity that individuals and society at large experience once they have been totally deprived of actively participating in the decision-making process of history. At this point in time sculptors seem to be tempted to offer their services for monumental public commissions which embody those latent tendencies; they fill the gaps of historic identity with gigantic monuments. The recent increase in public commissions for monumental sculpture confirms this hypothesis, and the critics rhapsodize already in a new ideology of post-modernist populism: The root of the difficulty would seem to lie back at the turn of the century with the disappear- ance of the monument. Avant-garde art in general, with its oppressive neutrality of content, has a long history of being perceived by the public at large as irrelevant. Its abstractness, however, is not the problem as much as its failure to conduct a public dialogue. Belief or conviction on the part of the artist, while perhaps the most important single ingredient of a great work of art, is not, as far as the public is concerned, a substitute for symbolic content. . . . The artists who succeed there . .. will be those who are willing to come to terms with the notion of public commitment, who realize that such a stance, far from compromising their work, can infuse it with non-esthetic content which has absented itself from modernist art.24 In his two installations in Chicago Michael Asher did not adapt to these historic tendencies but incorporated these tendencies manifestly into his work to make them transparent. The specificity of Asher's installations in regard to all the elements that enter the conception, production, and reception of a sculptural construct results in a model of historicity. This analytical model dismantles the new historism of Post-Modernism where regressions into a mythical language cover the problematic conditions of the present. Appendix A Handout prepared by Michael Asher for Art Institute installation Michael Asher 73rd American Exhibition The Art Institute of Chicago June 9-August 5, 1979 The sculpture of George Washington, cast in 1917, is a replica of the marble sculpture of 1788 by Jean Antoine Houdon. In 1925 it was installed in front of the Michigan Avenue entrance of the Art Institute. As my work for the 73rd American Exhibition (June 9-August 5, 1979), I have moved the sculpture of George Washington into the galleries. The sculpture is on the second floor in Gallery 219. For directions please ask one of the guards. In this work I am interested in the way the sculpture functions when it is viewed in its eighteenth-century context instead of in its prior relationship to the fagade of the building, where it has been for fifty-four years. Once inside Gallery 219, the sculpture can be seen in connection with the ideas of other European works of the same period. By locating the sculpture within its own time frame in Gallery 219, I am placing it within the framework of a contemporary exhibition, through my participa- tion in that exhibition. Appendix B Handout prepared by Michael Asher for Museum of Contem- porary Art installation Michael Asher Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago June 8 through August 12, 1979 The newly remodeled building of the Museum of Contempor- ary Art, designed by the architectural firm of Booth, Nagel and Hartray, was completed in March 1979. The facade of the 293</page><page sequence="19">museum is planned on a five-and-one-half-foot-square grid pattern and is constructed with glass and aluminum. Two rows of aluminum panels, which are attached to and cover an underlying brick structure, line up horizontally with the two rows of glass windows of the Bergman Gallery. The glassed- in Bergman Gallery functions as a showcase so that art is visible from the street. In this work, I have removed from the fagade the two horizontal rows of aluminum panels that are in line with the I. M. M. Bakhtin and P. N.

On the level of sculptural production, materials, and procedures on which we have tried to focus here, it seems only a matter of time now that the return of bronze casting in sculpture will be celebrated as an innovative and courageous return to the essence and roots of sculpture. As an aesthetic equivalent to ruthless and outright political reaction, casted bronze sculpture offers the stubborn solidity and semblance of perpetuity with which contemporaries can identify. It is noteworthy that even five years ago such a shift would have been almost incon- ceivable-which again proves to what extent those aspects of aesthetic production carry meaning. Also, it is certainly no accident that Michael Asher's installation at the Art Institute of Chicago integrates a bronze cast into his work, thus quite elliptically pointing to the imminent sculptural reactions without directly participating in them. 9. B. Arvatov, Kunst und Produktion (1925), Munich, 1972: II. 10. Information on this issue is conflicting. In Cleve Gray's David Smith by David Smith (New York, 1968: 174) is the following: Smith often made a point of his poverty during the thirties and forties and his consequent need to work. In his statement for Elaine de Kooning's article "David Smith makes a sculp- ture" in Art News No. 50 (Sept. '51), page 37, he wrote: "All of my life the work day has been any part of the twenty-four hours on oil tankers, driving hacks and the shifts in factories." His first wife, Dorothy Dehner, has said that Smith exagger- ated this aspect of his life greatly and that due to a small income of hers at this time Smith's obligation to work at odd jobs was almost non-existent. Rosalind Krauss related the following in Terminal Iron Works (Cambridge, 1971: 60, n. 16): In the three years in Schenectady during which he worked eight hours a day in the factory as a welder on M 7 tanks and locomotives, Smith identified himself increasingly with his fellow workers. Not only was he fiercely proud of his status within the factory unit and a "first class armor plate welder" (see Archive IV/280), but his sculptural output dropped off radically at this time, as he became absorbed in his work in the Bergman Gallery and have placed them on the interior wall of the gallery. The ten panels from the east side of the building and the eight from the west are arranged inside so that they corre- spond exactly to their previous positions outside. After August 12, 1979, the aluminum panels will be reinstalled on the exterior of the building. This work belongs to the museum's permanent collection. It is intended to be repeated each year for approximately two months, or the length of a temporary exhibition. munitions plant. From 1942 to 1944 he made almost no metal sculpture, beginning instead to learn stonecutting and carving, and in the entire span of those three years, he produced only fifteen pieces. 1 . Duchamp's own notes in the Green Box read as follows: "Flat container in glass-holding all sorts of liquids. Colored pieces of wood, of iron, chemical reactions. Shake the container and look through it. Parts to look at crossed eyed, like a piece of silvered glass, in which are reflected the objects in a room." See The Bride Stripped Bare ... (The Green Box), London/New York, 1960, n.p. 12. D. Graham, "Other Observations," For Publication, Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, 1976, n.p. I3. See, for example, Bakhtin/Medvedev (note i) and the radical change in the thinking and writing of Ossip Brik, who shifted from a pure formalist position to one of a committed productivist in Into Production (1923). More recently, however, it seems that critics, historians, and artists have become reluctant to acknowledge the historical and aesthetic consequences that their own work generates. It is symptomatic that artists and critic/historians alike react when confronted with such a radical paradigmatical shift in sculptural production. For example, Rosalind Krauss, whose book Passages can be rightfully considered as the most com- plex and advanced reading of modernist and post-modernist sculpture to date, literally excludes all of those sculptural ac- tivities that question the materials and production procedures of traditional modernist sculpture and that conceive "sculp- tural" phenomena (i.e., perceptual and actual subject/object interactions) within a historically defined and conditioned time/ space coordinate system. Krauss does not once mention the work of Asher, Robert Barry, Dan Graham, or Lawrence Weiner-artists who have all substantially redefined the idea of the "sculptural" in their work. This omission of the essen- tial innovations within the very same aesthetic discipline to which a particular study is dedicated ironically enough had its precedent in a publication that ten years earlier was also con- sidered the most advanced critical study of modernist sculp- ture-Jack Burnham's Beyond Modern Sculpture. Published at a time when crucial steps in the definition of minimal sculpture had been taken, this book does not mention Andre once and only randomly deals with the sculpture of the minimalists. It seems that critic/historians in situations of radical shifts displace their critical attention to highly derivative, secondary, or tertiary forms of academicized artistic production-however conspicuously obsolete-that at least reaffirm the perpetual validity of aesthetic categories and corresponding critical ap- parati. See, for example, the attention paid by critics to this kind of sculpture by Alice Aycock, George Trakas, Dennis Oppenheim, etc. Once critics have devoted their work to a particular kind of aesthetic production, they cannot easily acknowledge paradig- matical shifts in historically determined production procedures. Secondary work not only seems to save and justify in retro- 294</page><page sequence="20">historians' commitment to one particular aspect of the aesthetic discourse (at the price of excluding others) but also seemingly justifies the perpetuation of that perspective and the ongoing application of its obsolete methodological tools. Obviously, this mechanism functions mutually for both artists and critics. Artists in such situations tend to make apodictic statements that shift the category of sculpture from the historical to the ontological level. See, for example, a recent statement by Serra in October (Io [19791: 73) claiming the universal and eternal validity of sculptural notions: I have always thought that the basic assumption of film could never be sculptural in any way and to bog the analogy be- tween what is assumed to be sculptural in sculpture and what is assumed to be sculptural in film is not really to understand the potential of what sculpture is and always has been. 14.

The notion of "place" in sculpture was originally coined by Barnett Newman in regard to his sculptural work Here I (I951). It can be assumed that both Andre and Flavin, fervent admirers of Newman's work, derived their concept of place in sculpture from him.
