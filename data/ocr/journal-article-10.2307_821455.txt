<plain_text><page sequence="1">From the Editor t has been a pleasure during my edi- torship to devote one of the eight an- nual EJ issues to a showcase of our talent and our ability As teachers, many of us spend our lives and ener- gies praising and nurturing the talent of our students: this annual issue has given us a chance to celebrate the tal- ent of our own. This issue marks the fourth English Journal Literary Festi- val, and it includes the photography and the essays, short fiction, and poetry writ- ten by teachers and readers of EnglishJournal. As I tried to convey in my editorial for the first Literary Festival issue, it is my belief that in the heart of every English teacher is a poet and a story teller and an artist, and I feel this issue is clear confirmation of that belief. Thanks go to the four years' Literary Fes- tival judges, men and women who have gen- erously donated their time to read and select the best submitted. Over the years, those judges have included: Jim Wayne Miller, Kim Stafford, Henry Taylor, and Ron Smith (po- etry); Mary Flinn, Robley Wilson, Jr., and George Garrett (short fiction); Hal Crowther, Marita Golden, and Mary Clearman Blew (essay); and Lee Brauer (photography). Thanks also to David Black, poetry editor of EJ, and teacher Ellen Seay Young, colleagues who have not only served as occasional judges of short fiction and essay but who have also helped make the initial selection of submissions sent on for judging. In an an- nual two-day round robin reading marathon, David, Ellen, and I have read every submis- sion sent in-often over 300 pieces in a given year-and have selected the best for final judging. As a last note, I take this opportunity to thank all those who have submitted their work for the four Literary Festivals. Reading your poetry, fiction, essays, and looking at your photographs has been a highlight of my year, and putting this issue together has al- ways been one of the happiest of my tasks as EJ editor. As most readers know, this issue marks the end of my term as editor of English Journal. I take this opportunity to thank a number of people who have worked on this magazine and who have worked diligently on the 32 is- sues of EJ published since September 1994. At NCTE Headquarters, I thank Cliff Maduzia, the manager of finances and pro- duction details; Rona Smith, production ed- itor; Carrie Stewart, advertising coordinator; Marlo Welshons, director of NCTE journals; and Karen Smith, NCTE Associate Executive Director. All five have worked long and hard with the myriad details of EnglishJournal. In particular I express appreciation to the in- defatigable Rona Smith, with whom I have communicated on almost a daily basis for the past four years. Rona's appetite for detail is inexhaustible-an indispensable virtue for her job-and she has been hardworking, consistent, and utterly reliable. At my institution, Virginia Common- wealth University, I thank my dean, John S. Oehler, whose financial and moral support have been essential to my editorship. I also thank my division head, Alan M. McLeod, a lifetime member of NCTE and EJ reader. Over the years Alan has read and responded to almost all of my draft editorials, and he has been an important sounding board. The two EJ editorial assistants, Charlice Moore and Mary Reynolds, have been most appre- ciated, and their work and steadiness have been invaluable. The 300 outside reviewers have read and assessed almost all of the nearly 4,000 manu- scripts submitted during my tenure as editor of English Journal. As in previous years, their names appear in the back of this April issue, and I thank them for their work. In addition, the members of the EJ Advisory Committee, Jackie Bryant-Turner, Kristina M. Elias, Car- ole Williams, and Driek Zirinsky have offered excellent advice over the years. The EJ column editors have been vital to the success of the journal, sending in detailed and thoughtful pieces, some of which they have written, and some of which they have solicited and edited. I thank Charlotte K. Brooks, Lanny van Alien, Alan B. Teasley, C. Anne Webb, Lois Stover, MaryCarmen Cruz, Ogle Burks Duff, Mary Mercer Krogness, Dana Fox, Dan Heller, and Joan Kaywell. For four years of columns I also thank Bonnie Er- icson, Diana Mitchell, Patricia EP Kelly, Joyce English Journal 11</page><page sequence="2">Graham, and David Black. In particular I am appreciative of the work of Bonnie Ericson, whose reviews column was handled with fairness and aplomb and to Diana Mitchell, whose columns on the practical details of teaching greatly enriched each issue. The Steering Committee of the Secondary Section also receives my warm thanks: they have been perceptive, supportive, and helpful colleagues. They make me proud to be a member of NCTE's Secondary Section and have given me guidance through many chal- lenging times. While many members of the Committee have been especially helpful, I would like to particularly thank Joan Naomi Steiner for her support and assistance. I also thank a select group of folks, the former editors of English ournal. My immedi- ate predecessor, Ben Nelms, gave me sound advice that carried me through almost all the ups and downs of this experience, and he has been a good and steadfast friend and advisor. Alleen Nilsen and Ken Donelson have also been immensely supportive: they have re- viewed manuscripts, given counsel, and I have been delighted to print the excellent ar- ticles and columns which they have written and shared during my editorship. I also thank Stephen Tchudi, who has not only re- viewed and written for EJ but who has been, in his groundbreaking years as editor, a par- ticular inspiration and model. The contributors, those who wrote arti- cles and columns, drew cartoons, took pho- tographs, and submitted games are also thanked. Their work is the heart of English Journal, and I deeply appreciate their time and talent. The new editor of English Journal, Vir- ginia Monseau, is thoughtful and energetic. She brings to this magazine a sure grasp of the profession and will, as she should, take EJ in new directions. I thank her for her friend- ship and her collegiality, and, like all of you, I look forward to her editorship. Finally, I thank one person whose work permeates every issue of English Journal and who has, over the four years, either art di- rected or created 20 of the EJ covers. Tucker Conley is a graphic designer, and his vision of a readable magazine which is friendly and yet elegant has shaped the past four years of EJ. The EJ logo, the typeface, the page lay- outs, the computer icons for the columns, the use of cartoons, the highlighting of the poetry are all his work. I thank him for his care and his understanding of what English Journal is and needs to be. Tucker has worked on a number of other academic journals- including The ALAN Review-and on more commercial publications, such as National Geographic. His taste and intelligence are greatly appreciated, and he has been my major support during this editorship. Senior Kelly Romack works on her writing in the school cafeteria.

It is the ~J "library" and the collection is sent,in turn, to each of the editors to use and then to pass on to their successors. In those volumes is the enduring history of our profession, and it has been nothing less than a privilege to be a part of that history and to be, in a way, not just the editor but the steward of EnglishJournal. Since 1912, and it is hoped for many years into the future, Eng- lish teachers have looked to EJ for informa- tion, inspiration, and advice. I have tried in my editorship to maintain that tradition and, as all editors are wont to do, to also push the tradition a bit, too. During my EJ editorship, I have encoun- tered my share of controversy, and I suspect that my predecessors had similar, if not as frequent, incidents. As regular subscribers of EJ are aware, some readers have requested that editorial apologies be placed in the jour- nal, some readers have written letters to the editor fervently wishing that certain articles never appeared, and some have written ex- tensive rebuttals. Some have wondered out loud if EJ could still be their professional journal and have indicated their intent to drop or suspend their subscription. On the other hand, many readers have written, called, and given extensive and at times even embarrassingly fulsome praise for what has appeared in the journal. Such is free speech in a heterogenous society, and such is the na- ture of the ongoing conversation in our field of English teaching. This continuing debate and argument is, in my experience, a clear indication of the robust health of an acade- mic journal. If nothing else, EJ has never in- spired indifference and continues to endure as a forum for discussion. A strong and responsible academic jour- nal must solicit and publish a wide variety of views: there has been room made in English Journal for articles which attack Ebonics, ad- vocate the use of grammar charts, encourage the increased teaching of the Bible as litera- ture, and call for more understanding of the views of religious fundamentalists. There has been room made for the strong advocacy of contemporary and multicultural literature, of gay and lesbian literature, and for intellectual freedom in the classroom. Pieces attacking and pieces praising the NCTE/IRA Stan- dards, the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and Pacesetter English have been printed in their turn. Letters to the editor have appeared which laud and which condemn not only what is in English Journal but what other EJ letter writers have advo- cated. All views are and should be welcome, and when they are not, EJ will wither as a place to discuss, argue, and explore. Personally, my work as editor has been all-consuming these past four years, but it has also been overwhelmingly worthwhile. It may strike many as wholly anthropomorphic and certainly a bit extreme, but EnglishJour- nal is, to me, a living thing. As many readers know and as some have probably suspected, I have tended and at times guarded, I have worried and labored over this journal in very personal and intense terms. I close with an excerpt of a letter sent to EJ by a classroom teacher. The comments represent all I have tried to do with English Journal and all, in essence, that I think EJ should and can be to its readers: EJ is accessible to ordinary teachers, providing them with the opportunity to publish in the same journal that published Howard Gardner [in your recent multiple intelligence issue] ... What an important vehicle you, as editor, provide. This is not idle flattery because I am submitting my writing after twenty-two years. Just having my writing ready to send out is a major achievement in my life. Whether my article is selected or not, the good for me, not unlike John Proctor, has emerged. Thank you for continuing to provide a place for me to reach. This month I take the bound volumes of EJ from my bookcase and pack them up for mailing. This month I thank you, all of you, for providing me the opportunity to be the eighth editor of English Journal. It has been for me, as it has been for some others, a place indeed to reach.
