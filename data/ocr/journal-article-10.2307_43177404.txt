Understanding how student misconceptions change over the years can help teachers know what to expect when introducing a complex concept. by Joseph Stepans and M. Lois Veath During a investigated number the past of students' researchers several con- years, have a number of researchers have investigated students' con- ceptions of science. Most of these studies reveal that students, prior to formal instruction, have their own notions of concepts such as living/ nonliving, weather, sinking and floating, electricity and magnetism, and Earth and space; and that these notions may be quite differ- ent from the way the concepts are presented in textbooks. The studies further conclude that traditional instruction, to a small extent, helps learners to develop "correct" no- tions^ 1) But the more we as teach- ers know about our students' pre- conceptions, the more we can develop new and unique ways to help them to overcome or modify their naive ideas. We conducted a study of stu- dents in grades three, five, seven, and nine to investigate their con- ceptions of physical and chemical changes of matter. These concepts appear in science textbooks as early as third grade, and by sixth grade (sometimes earlier), scientific ter- minology, formulas, and chemical models for these concepts begin to show up. Most ninth-grade physical science textbooks describe physical and chemical changes in detail at the atomic and subatomic level, addressing chemical reactions in terms of electron exchange, half reactions, and more. Our study centered around two questions: "When students observe physical and chemical changes, how do they explain the changes at the particle level?" and "Do students' explanations of these changes evolve at the same rate as the concepts themselves in text- Joseph Stepans is a professor of science and mathematics education at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, and M.

The ball of clay was placed between the hands and smashed into a pancake, but when the same thing was tried with the steel ball, no change occurred. The student was asked, "If you had a giant microscope and could see the smallest parts and the changes that occur, what would you be seeing? What is the reason that we were able to smash the clay ball, but no matter how much we try, we are not able to do that with the steel ball?" Outward appearance Third grader: "Clay is getting flat because it is softer- the steel ball is too hard to squeeze." Naive structure Seventh grader: 'The atoms in the clay are like rubber balls, they are squishing together. The atoms in steel are hard and not squishing." Atomic interaction Ninth grader: "Maybe there are more molecules in steel balls and they are closely packed. So your hand cannot exert enough pressure, because the bond between the particles is stronger than your hand. Only heat or chemical change can change the bond or separate molecules." Dissolving A tablespoon of salt was placed in a beaker of water and stirred. A teaspoon of cornstarch was placed in a second beaker and stirred. After stirring, the beaker with salt was clear, but the one with cornstarch was cloudy. The student was asked, "If you had a giant microscope and could see the smallest particle, what would you be seeing? What would be the difference betwèen the two beakers?" Outward appearance Fifth grader: "Specks of cream stuff. Cloudy. Can see through salt better. Cornstarch looks like milk. Salt water looks like dirty water." Naive structure Seventh grader: "In the beaker with salt, it is not dissolving because the atoms are remaining in the particle of salt, the cornstarch is dissolving because the atoms are being released and spreading into the water with the particles." Atomic interaction Ninth grader: "In the case of salt, it dissolves into the water. This happens when the molecules of salt become separated from each other and become scattered among the water molecules. While the starch in the cornstarch doesn't completely dissolve due to the molecular structure of the starch, which when added to water starts to thicken, and will color it because the molecules are smaller than salt and it doesn't dissolve but mixes in with the water." Phase change An ice cube was placed in a beaker and heated slowly on a hot plate. The student observed as the ice cube melted and changed to steam. A piece of dry ice was placed in another beaker and, when heated, it changed to a "white cloud." The student was asked, "If you had a giant microscope and could see the smallest particle, what would you be seeing? What would you be seeing in ice that melted and changed to steam, and why does dry ice behave differ- ently from ice?" books for their specific age groups?" To answer these questions, we individually interviewed 39 third graders, 70 fifth graders, 33 seventh graders, and 28 ninth graders, who were randomly selected from neigh- borhood schools. At the interviews, we demonstrated each of the fol- lowing phenomena: • Shape change • Dissolving • Phase change • Chemical change After each demonstration, we asked the student to explain what had occurred at the molecular level. (See Figure 1.) Student responses In responding to the questions, students had the option to write, draw a picture, or build a model using ordinary materials around the room. We sorted students' responses into four categories: no response, outward appearance, naive structure, and atomic interactions. • Outward appearance - The stu- dent concentrated only on what he or she observed with the naked eye. • Naive structure - The student misapplied the behavior of mat- ter at the particle level to the given situation. • Atomic interaction - The student was able to correctly apply par- ticle-level behavior to the given situation. Table 1 shows the breakdown of student responses in each of the four grades studied. The data reveal that most of the third graders' responses fell primarily in the out- ward appearance category. Most of the fifth graders also concentrated on outward appearance, but some SCIENCE SCOPE MAY 19 9 4</page><page sequence="4">Outward appearance Ninth grader: "Ice is water and as soon as it melts it bubbles and becomes a wet steam. Dry ice would steam and just evaporate into the air." Naive structure Seventh grader: "I think the ice cube only goes through different stages but doesn't change the size or space between the atoms when they turn into air." Seventh grader: "Ice = It has a liquid molecule so it condenses." Fifth grader: "Ice cube is making water. The dry ice isn't. There are oxygen bubbles in the ice. The ice is liquid. The dry ice stays dry." Ninth grader: "Ice is clear water. Dry ice is just hydrogen floating around in it, which keeps it from melting." Atomic interaction Seventh grader: "The ice cube's molecules are arranged tightly together. It becomes a liquid which sets the molecules apart, and when it turns into a gas the molecules are set apart more. In the dry ice the molecules are tight and then when it becomes a gas they are very loose. The difference between the two is the ice cube is made of frozen water and the dry ice is made of compressed gas. Another one is that the ice cube has two stages before the gas and the dry ice - one stage before the gas." Chemical reaction A teaspoon of baking soda was placed in a beaker. A small amount of vinegar was added, and bubbles and steam were produced. The student was asked, "If you had a giant microscope and could see the smallest particle, what would you be seeing before the vinegar was added and after the vinegar was added?" Outward appearance Fifth grader: "Lots of foaming bubbles. Has bitter smell. The baking soda would dissolve. If it was an extra strong microscope you might see germs. You could see the powdery of the baking soda. In the beginning it was dry and now it is wet. The vinegar used to be a dark orange and it changed to a light beige." Naive structure Ninth grader: "I would see baking particles being eaten away by vinegar - and all that is left is the vinegar particles." Seventh grader: "Chemical change is taking place by air pushing the atoms and molecules." Atomic interaction Ninth grader: "You will see a chemical change taking place. When the two different types of molecules come together they give off a reaction. In the microscope, you see molecules changing and combining." Seventh grader: "The molecules in the baking soda are pairing up with the molecules in the vinegar and are producing different substances like gas." Seventh grader: "When the two compounds come together in a chemical reaction they form new compounds. You would see the two different mol- ecules coming together and forming a different molecule." gave responses that fell in the naive structure category. A much smaller number of seventh graders concentrated on outward appear- ance, while most gave naive struc- ture responses, and a few gave responses that fell in the atomic interaction category. In the case of ninth graders, only a small number of responses fell in the atomic interaction category, and surpris- ingly more concentrated on out- ward appearance than the seventh graders. Conclusions Students' responses answered our first question, "When students observe physical and chemical changes, how do they explain the changes at the particle level?" But what about our second question, "Do students' explanations of these changes evolve at the same rate as the concepts themselves in text- books for their specific age groups?" We found that they do not. By sixth or seventh grade, most science textbooks abandon the emphasis on outward appearance and move quickly into the atomic and subatomic behaviors of matter. However, from our interviews we found that students can retain their concentration on outward appear- ance even up to ninth grade. As students move into seventh grade and beyond, the majority shift their emphasis from outward appearance to naive structure. This shift sug- gests that as students are exposed to more abstract concepts in their textbooks, they feel obligated to apply those abstract ideas, even if they lack the understanding to apply them properly. We learned that most of the students did not fully accept many of the abstract SCIENCE SCOPE MAY 1994</page><page sequence="5">Key: X = No Response O = Outward N = Naive A = Atomic Interaction Grade 3 Grade 5 Grade 7 Grade 9 total students = 39 total students = 70 total students = 33 total students = 28 Shane 36 (°) 31 (°) 1 (°) 8 (°) Chanae 9 3 39 &lt;N&gt; 29 &lt;N&gt; 16 9 3 (A) 4 (A) 34(0) 55(0) 3(0) 16(0) Dissolving 3 (N) 12 (N) 28 (N) 8 (N) 2 (X) 3 (X) 1 (A) 4 (A) MX) Phase 29(0) 55(0) 10(0) 15(0) Chanae 9 3 &lt;N&gt; 14 22 &lt;N&gt; 9 &lt;N&gt; 9 7 (X) 1 (X) 1 (A) 4 (A) 33(0) 45 (O) 9(0) 14(0) Chemical 6 (X) 20 (N) 17 (N) 9 (N) Change 5 (X) 2 (A) 1 (A) MX) 4 (X) ideas related to physical and chemical changes, and as a result, they took these ideas in bits and pieces, mixing their own macro- scopic ideas with the textbook's microscopic viewpoint. For ex- ample, some students who were trying to explain changes at the molecular, atomic, or subatomic levels spoke of atoms in the mol- ecules actually "escaping," "expand- ing," "shrinking," and so on. Thus, when the evolution of students' ideas cannot keep up with increasingly abstract textbook ex- planations, students often fill in their own information, resulting in confusion and misconceptions. In order for teachers to help students modify their preconceived ideas and reconcile them with the way the same concepts are ex- plained in textbooks, we need to become aware of the ideas students bring with them to the classroom. Through interviews and listening to students, we can identify stu- dents' ideas and then treat them as hypotheses to be tested and discussed in class. Andersson sug- gests that it is important for stu- dents to have the opportunity to discuss their ideas with each other and to develop an inquisitive atti- tude toward their own hypoth- eses. (2) Students must learn to ask themselves, "If my hypothesis is correct, what are its consequences? What experiments can I design to test my hypothesis?" Because many students have difficulty thinking in abstract terms, perhaps we need to present abstract concepts in ways that students can manipulate for them- selves. Concepts could be ap- proached in two ways: Students could suggest and test their own mental models of the concepts, or they could conduct experiments and, based on the outcomes, de- velop models for what they observe. To help counteract the common confusion between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds that we noted in many students' responses, teachers and textbooks need to choose their language carefully. For example, when discussing sub- stances with students in chemistry class, a teacher may choose to say that "water consists of oxygen and hydrogen" or that "water is built up of hydrogen and oxygen." Both statements may be correct, but each affects student understanding in a different way.(2) Although both of these statements may imply chemical bonding and molecules, the concrete learner may fill in the relationship in the first statement by imagining a physical mixture of atoms similar to two types of marbles packed in a plastic bag. SCIENCE SCOPE O MAY 19 9 4</page><page sequence="6">Students who have incorrect ideas of atoms and molecules are likely to interpret the teacher's statement as mixing ideas from the macro- scopic world with the microscopic phenomenon being discussed. Confusion between macroscopic and microscopic ideas can last far beyond the ninth grade. In a study of 500 students in a college chem- istry course, Strauss and Levine found that many students extended macroscopic properties like color and hardness to the atomic and molecular levels. (3) They found that while the terminology used in many instances was correct, stu- dents' understandings of the terms were often drawn from the macro- scopic level of experience and applied incorrectly to the micro- scopic level. Recommendations There is such a great deal to be learned at the macroscopic level about physical and chemical changes that we need not empha- size microscopic properties so early on. Historically, scientists have observed macroscopic behaviors of physical and chemical changes and quantified these phenomena with respect to reversibility, temperature, pressure, volume, and density. Only after extensive macroscopic obser- vations were microscopic hypoth- eses or scientific models examined. In the same way, elementary school children can benefit more if they have the opportunity to learn through their own actions - spend time observing phenomena and the results of their own actions on things - without attempting to understand the atomic structure and interactions. As we move to the upper grades, providing appropriate models and other representations is very impor- tant as students begin to make the transition from macroscopic to microscopic thinking. Recent stud- ies indicate that the majority of high school students may still be concrete operational learners. This suggests that macroscopic investiga- tions by students should continue through high school. Furthermore, before we even start to present and discuss abstract concepts such as chemical models, atoms, or subatomic particles, we should begin by concentrating on the meaning of the word model. Concrete learners identify explicitly with models as "the real thing" and do not extend their ideas beyond them until the transition to ab- stract thinking. (4) Thus the repre- sentations of models we use carry strong messages for the learner. Illustrations in textbooks, sketches on chalkboards, three-dimensional molecular models, marshmallow and toothpick activities, and even anthropomorphic language used by teachers are interpreted literally by students. Because students cannot directly experience the microscopic expla- nations for their macroscopic obser- vations, students can only accept without question the teacher's or textbook's representations. And because of the lack of concrete experience with atomic phenom- ena, the given explanations often lead to confusion and naive conceptions. Activities that help students develop the concept of what a model is, how it is subject to change and refinement, and how it may be useful within limitations become extremely important, therefore, beginning in the primary grades and continuing through college. Beginning with familiar gadgets such as toys, rolling cans, or candy machines, students can build mental models visualizing the workings of these gadgets and toys, describe their models to the class in their own words, and discuss which model best explains how the gadget really works. With older students, compari- sons to historical models and a study of their evolution and refine- ment into the twentieth century can reinforce the fact that even scientists have ideas that are often flawed and subject to change. This realization builds students' confi- dence that their ideas are testable and valid. Such confidence is im- portant in terms of deemphasizing the rote memorization of micro- scopic explanations that have no meaning for the learner and only lead to misconceptions. From our research, we believe that spending time discussing mod- els of ordinary phenomena provides a good transition to the study of abstract concepts. Such preparation will allow students to be more open to abstract concepts, and to gradu- ally shift their views away from outward appearance and toward atomic interactions. □ References 1.
