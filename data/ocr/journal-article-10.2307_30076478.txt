<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES &amp; QUERIES THE GASEOUS VERTEBRATE UNRIDDLED HARALD BECK has tracked down the source of the key phrase in the mischievous question which Buck Mulligan puts to Stephen in 'Scylla and Charybdis': 'You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mis- take not?'(U 9.487) Don Gifford, in his 'Ulysses' Annotated (Revised and Expanded Edition, 1988), mere- ly glosses it thus: 'Having a spine but without substance, a ghost; in this case "the son consubstantial with the father"', for Buck has just entered with an 'Amen!' to Stephen's identification of Shakespeare with both the Hamlets, son and father: 'He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore's rocks ...' But Buck's satirical quo- tation derives from Ernst Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe (Die Weltratsel, 1899), translated into English by Joseph McCabe in 1900 and included in The Thinker's Library series of freethinking texts published by Watts and Co. The phrase appears on page 235 in Chapter XV of that translation: In the higher and more abstract formis of religion this idea of bodily appearance is entirely abandoned, and God is adored as a 'pure spirit' without a body 'God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.' Nevertheless, the psychic activity of this 'pure spirit' remains just the same as that of the anthropomorphic God. In reality, even this immaterial spirit is not conceived to be incorpo- real, but merely invisible, gaseous. We thus arrive at the paradoxical conception of God as gaseous eerte- brate. Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919), the great biologist and foremost German apostle of Darwinism, is probably best remembered in his association with Recapitulation Theory whose crucial but now discredited maxim is 'Ontogeny repeats phylogeny'. The Riddle of the Universe, a kind of summa of his 'monistic philosophy', is an application to philosophy and religion of his atheistic evolutionary belief that the rajor world-enigmas are solved or soluble and that science has rendered obsolete concepts such as God, freewill and immortality: Joyce may be alluding playfully to the title in the riddle-haunt- ed Wake ('the first riddle of the universe', 170.4; 'the first and last rittlerattle of the anniverse', 607.10-11), and Haeckel seems an appropriate inspiration for the jesting medic whom Stephen assigns to a 'Brood of mockers'. (U 9.492) Although one might consider Joyce's attitude to religion immensely more complicated than Haeckel's, it is notable that, in his penultimate chapter, the German, likeJoyce, made much of Jesus's failure to have experienced, 'the intimate life of man with woman'. In the Joycean context, the referent of the quoted phrase is surely ambiguous, either God (Haeckel's para- dox) or Shakespeare (treated flippantly by Buck a few lines below)? Most probably, this is an invocation of both, as 'authors' situated simultaneously inside and outside their works. In this light, Haeckel aptly associ- ates 'gaseous' with invisibility, a major motif in both the aesthetics and practice of Ulysses, and the suggestion of formlessness is consonant with the repudiation of Nco- Platonic essences and Theosophical, etheric entities which go to make up the endangering whirlpool in 'Scylla and Charybdis' episode in particular. However, the more obviously disrespectful potential of 'gaseous', may also be realised in a chain of serio-comic associa- tions that link Bloom's reflection on spirits in the grave- yard -'Gas of graves' (U6. 753) - to the windy ghost of Hamlet's father, and thence to 'gas' as on the one hand, empty talk or 'gassing' (as in 'Lestrygonians' and 'Cyclops') , and on the other, flatulence (as in 'Hades' and 'Sirens'). Since Goethe's F'aust functions as one of the principal models for Joyce's epic, with Buck Mulligan playing a Mephistophelian role, it may be worth pointing out that the title of the chapter in which the 'gaseous vertebrate' appears, 'God and the World', is a homage to a poem of Goethe's so prized by Haeckel, who repeatedly and controversially hailed the great poet as a prophet of Darwinism, that he concluded his unriddling book with a eulogistic reference to this 'immortal' poetic expres- sion of the master's 'philosophy of unity'.
