<plain_text><page sequence="1">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase Stephen Guy-Bray University of British Columbia James Purdy s novel Eustace Chisholm and the Works,first published in 1967 but set in Depression-era Chicago, is centrally concerned with the relationship between reality and art or, in other words, with the question of artistic realism. This essay argues that for Purdy the most important term in this novel is paraphrase. To what extent should a work of art function as a sort of paraphrase of real life? What other criteria than realism apply or should apply to the relationship between life andan artistic representation of life? And what sorts of events or emotions are not generally considered worthy of representation (whether because they are too sexual or too violent or not sexual or violent in the right way)? Using the figure of the unsuccessful poet Eustace Chisholm, Purdy offers a critique of unduly restrictive ideas about both art and life. Keywords: paraphrase / realism / homosexuality / Chicago / James Purdy James Purdy has had a curious literary career: he has never been particularly well-known, but (almost) all those who have read him consider him one of the very best contemporary American novelists. Still, there have been few critical studies of Purdy s works and because of his lack of popular acclaim, his novels have been chronically difficult to find, although in the last few years, Carroll and Graf Publishers in New York have brought out many of his books. Their new edition of Eustace Chisholm and the Works has two images on its cover: the weather-beaten side of a painted clapboard house and a moth.1 The edition I bought in a secondhand bookstore when I was 17 had a very different cover: with what my art teacher at the time would have called an effective use of light and shade, the picture shows a beau tiful young man with his arms crossed over his chest. The young man (but which of the young men in the novel is he?) is naked as far as we can see, which is down to just below his obliques. Naturally, I bought the book and I felt that my decision was justified both by the painting and by one of the reviews on the back cover, in which an unnamed writer for the Detroit News told potential buyers that Eustace Chisholm and the Works tells of homosexuals, yet it is not soft or faggy. ... It describes brutalities too raw for paraphrase ? abortion, incest, homosexual torture and castration. It is cruel and clinical, yet tender. It ends in death; it ends in hope.</page><page sequence="2">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 103 At $1.20, this was clearly a good buy. Describing the cover helps to focus attention on what are for me the books two most important aspects: Purdy's concentration on the erotic allure of men and on the idea of paraphrase. What little critical attention Eustace Chisholm and the Works has attracted has tended to focus on the former; my concern here is with the latter. In some ways, a paraphrase is the lowest form of text: not an original narrative but only a version of what has already been narrated, a mere record of facts whose sole purpose is explanation. Taken to extremes, the idea of art as paraphrase might lead us, for instance, to cover art?is the beautiful man Eustace or Amos or someone else? ? or perhaps to biographical interpretations, to the belief that Eustace Chish olm and the Works is the story of James Purdy. But there are more helpful ways to think of what a paraphrase is; the art historian Thomas Crow has suggested that it is a basic response to aesthetic objects: "[f]aced with a mute work of art, any interested observer enters into a process of translation, making sense of it by some form of paraphrase"(l). Crow goes on to say that this is normally only the first step in interpreting a work, but in Purdy's novel, as we shall see, some characters are unable to progress beyond this step. The etymology of the word "paraphrase" is important, as the word has the same useful ambiguity as "parody," which can mean either a song produced in opposition to another song or as an accompaniment to that song, or indeed both. A paraphrase, then, can be a narrative (the basic meaning of the ancient Greek verb phrazo is to tell a story) that either retells or, at least, complements another narrative. Eustace Chisholm and the Works is a paraphrase both because it is in opposition to, say, stones of Chicago in the depression that mention neither homosexuals nor blacks and because the narrative incessantly juxtaposes kinds of writing and choices of subject matter and thus brings many varieties of text into collision: to some extent, Purdy presents the urge to paraphrase events in speech or writing at both colloquial and artistic levels as one of the commonest human impulses. Throughout the novel, Purdy gives us more than one paraphrase of the events in his narrative or provides us with the materials to make our own (different) paraphrase of what we have read. From this point of view, Eustace Chisholm and the Works is not a single unified text but rather a series of texts whose interconnections are not immediately?and perhaps not ever?clear. The best way to illustrate what I mean is to quote the novel's extraordinary first paragraph: Eustace Chisholm's street, with the Home for the Incurables to the south and the streetcar line to the west, extended east up to blue immense choppy Lake Michigan. South of its terminus the great gray museum took up acres and acres with its caryatids, and further south rose the steel mills of Gary and South Chicago with their perpetual vomit of fire. Further down his street in a westerly direction, before Washington park slipped into the colored ghetto, there was a rose garden in which the German poet, Lessing, sat among the blooms. (3)2</page><page sequence="3">104 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 One thing to notice about this description is that Purdy makes use of pairs of nouns. This seems like the simplest structure possible, but a closer look at the pairs reveals that the logic of the paragraph is difficult to determine. The Home for the Incurables and the streetcar line are standard civic features, both of which are now rather outmoded. The first represents absolute fixity, as the inmates have lost, in one way or another, the basic right of mobility, but the second facilitates that right. The next pair is Lake Michigan and the museum. This one seems easy: nature and culture, the blue lake versus the gray building, the first "immense," which suggests a potentially boundless extent, and the second covering "acres and acres," which suggests a space on a map. So far, we appear to be dealing with relatively straightforward binary opposi tions, but the situation is complicated by the fact that the museum, insofar as it is a standard civic feature, is like the Home for Incurables and the streetcar line. Furthermore, the next pair is Gary and South Chicago. These are not opposites: both are industrial areas which generate much of the wealth that make it possible for Chicago to pay for the services it provides for its residents. Purdy's reference to the factories that support art chimes with his decision to single out the museum's caryatids rather than its famous collections or even its fa?ade as a whole. The men tion of caryatids sets up a contrast between the real labor that goes on in factories and the aestheticized representation of labor; in fact, the representation is doubly aestheticized as caryatids are a) an anthropomorphic rendering of pillars and b) not the actual load-bearing elements of the structure. A further example of where civic money goes is provided by the park that is mentioned at the end of the paragraph. This park appears to be in opposition to the ghetto, which as a place of urban blight seems closer to Gary or South Chicago. The opposition here may be considered to be strengthened by the fact that the park is named after Washington, who stands for the glorious dreams of the new republic, while the ghetto could be said to indicate the failure of those dreams. For me, however, the most important of all the pairs in this passage is com posed of those almost exactly contemporaneous figures (they were born only three years apart) George Washington and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The contrasts between the two may seem obvious ? the first was a native son, indeed one of the men credited with making it possible for Americans to be Americans, while the second was a European; the first was a man of action while the second was a writer?and these contrasts are certainly important to the novel. What may per haps not be obvious is what the two men have in common. Washington is usually seen as an innovator, as the first in a series: the first American, the first president, the father of his country. Lessing was also an innovator, in the sense that what he is best known for today is his contention that the German writers of his period should find their own ways of writing and move away from the dependence on French classicism that he saw as such a bad influence. Although his proposal of Shakespeare as a model for German writers opens him to the accusation that he sought merely to replace one form of foreign domination with another, what we could see as one of Lessing's most important contentions ? that art should be true</page><page sequence="4">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 105 to the writer's human context?is one that resonates in Eustace Chisholm and the Works. In this discussion of the novel's opening paragraph I have been reading para phrastically.3 That is, I have been working on the assumption that the elements that make up this paragraph are interrelated rather than merely juxtaposed. I could be wrong, of course, and I think Purdy has deliberately complicated the matter. One of the interests of an urban landscape such as the one offered by Purdy here is, precisely, that it seems to hover between interrelation (the grid pattern of streets, the spacing of civic features, the proximity of residential to commercial space, the network of public transit systems) and juxtaposition (the different and always changing character that neighborhoods assume, artificial versus natural features, the encroachment of one kind of use of space into a section originally intended for another use, the mingling of peoples originally geographically distinct?for instance, Purdy refers early on to "the sounds of Yiddish" and "the strange disori ented, Negroes, Poles and unidentifiable vagrants in the streets" [4]). The living arrangements at the beginning of the book give a particularly good example of the difficulty of paraphrase. By the end of the first chapter, Eustace is living with his wife and a salesman. For a husband and wife to live together seems normal, of course, and the presence of another man can easily be explained by the fact that the story takes place during the Depression. But Clayton Harms originally moved in because he was "struck by the poet's vague affability and his having a spare bedroom" (5), after which the two men became lovers, while Carla returned from her adulterous peregrinations without money and was forced to live with Eustace and his boyfriend. These arrangements can be taken to offer a cautionary tale about the difficulty of figuring out where connections exist and of what they consist: the paraphrase that I provided for the first chapter is not the obvious one. In this case, the difficulty of paraphrase comes chiefly from what is often referred to as the presumption of heterosexuality, and this is an important aspect o? Eustace Chisholm and the Works: Purdy shows us that the connections among people are more varied than our sys tems of thought allow for. If the writer's task is to be true to his own context, as the reference to Lessing might indicate, then to some extent the writer is giving a paraphrase (in the sense of a fuller explanation, which is the most traditional meaning of the word) of the world around him. But to give a plausible paraphrase of life in Chicago in the 1930s requires a complexity that works against the neat division of people into friends or lovers and the proviso that members of the same sex can only belong to the first category; it also works against the neat division of a city into white and black neighborhoods.4 Throughout Eustace Chisholm and the Works, Purdy demonstrates the extent to which his attempt to provide a paraphrase (in the basic sense of a narrative about the sort of characters he chose to write about) is hampered by set ways of thinking that provide ready-made paraphrases of urban life: men live together only out of economic necessity, blacks and whites have as little to do with each other as possible, and so on. I realize that Purdy is not the first name we would think</page><page sequence="5">106 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 of when compiling a list of American realists and that his work contains ? and, indeed, depends on?many unrealistic and even surrealistic elements, but part of the problem here is that our definition of realism is impoverished and that this is the case because our understanding of reality is impoverished.5 In this context, the allusion to Lessing in the first paragraph may again be relevant. The subtitle of Lao coon (for English speakers, surely Lessing's most famous work) is u?ber die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie"', on the limits of painting and poetry.6 Lessing's concern is chiefly with the ways in which painting and poetry differ in effectiveness, but we could also read the subtitle as raising the question of what is or is not permissible in a work of art, a question that is of great importance to Eustace Chisholm and the Works, which is a novel that takes place at the very limits of what is acceptable in novelistic discourse and often, in fact, beyond those limits. In the context of Purdy's literary career, the notional "we" who would not classify this novel as an example of realism refers most obviously to the American literary world of the last fifty years, but it also refers to characters in the novel. One such character is Daniel Haws, whose inability to fit his love for Amos Ratcliffe into any scheme of life he knows leads to utter disaster: for Daniel, the love of one man for another is not a real subject, not something that can actually take place. Another example is Eustace himself. Although he, unlike Daniel, is perfectly capable of acknowledging sexual and romantic feelings for other men, his own writ ing is hampered by the fact that he excludes from consideration most of the things he sees around him.7 The first thing we hear about Eustace Chisholm as a person is that he "had been caught up in two tragedies, the national one of his nation's economic collapse, and his failed attempt to combine marriage with the calling of narrative poet" (3). Here again, the question of juxtaposition versus interconnection arises: we can all see the connection between economic collapse and deciding to be a narrative poet, but that is not the connection Purdy makes. The one he does make is puzzling, as it is never clear why being a narrative poet should make mar riage more difficult; and when we learn more about Eustace and Carla it does not seem that his decision to follow in the footsteps of, say, Longfellow is the real fly in their conjugal ointment. Making some sort of connection between public events, such as the Depres sion, and private events, such as professional and romantic difficulties, is a charac teristic of much of the most highly-regarded American texts, but to do so requires a sense of scale and perspective that it will turn out Eustace simply does not have: for him, both tragedies are personal to him and neither will feature in his own writing. As Donald Pease remarks, "Eustace is one of the beginners' in Purdy's fiction ... who never do finally 'begin,' but remain marginal figures whose detach ment places them both in and out of the world that surrounds the other characters" (346). Although Eustace thinks of himself as writing a poem on national subjects, Purdy consistently presents the poem as isolated both from its subjects and from the reading public. For instance, he tells us that "[t]he only person who was at all impressed by his long narrative poem, written in charcoal stick on old pages of the Chicago Tribune, was Clayton Harms, the electric-sign salesman" (4-5).This first</page><page sequence="6">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 107 mention of Eustace's writing as a physical object presents his oeuvre as literally a paraphrase: writing beside other writing. Of course, Eustace uses charcoal as a writing implement and the Tribune as writing paper because he is so poor, but we should also take this sentence as suggesting that in writing beside (and over) the news of the day?and thus in making current events illegible ? Eustace is in a sense turning his back on the world around him: the words of the newspaper and the stories they tell are irrelevant to him. His writing is not a paraphrase of the society in which he lives. A different kind of paraphrase is indicated in the reference to Clayton Harms. In the 1930s, electric signs were still a recent innovation: in contrast, Eustace's poetry is, as the sentence hints, neither new nor news. Narrative poetry is one of the most ancient forms of literature, and Eustace's choice of genre links him to the distant past in which, for instance, caryatids rather than electric signs adorned the fronts of buildings. It also links him to Lessing's statue. As a stone object "among the blooms" (3), this statue echoes the contrast between the gray museum and the blue lake and reminds us that Lessing, whose Laocoon takes its title from a charac ter in the earliest narrative poem in our tradition, has himself, despite his calls for change, become an antique object, associated with the past and the burden of high art. A further implicit contrast in the sentence is between Eustace's poetry, with its lack of connection to the place in which he lives?what we could call its failure to be a paraphrase ? and Clayton's signs, which exist solely as paraphrase. At least, such was originally the case: now, many of the electric signs from the 20s and 30s are considered art, while narrative poetry is still a poor career choice. Eustace himself has no sense that his work is unsuccessful because of its form or subject matter: he "answered for his failure as a writer on the grounds that he was too far distant from the great monopoly city of New York, claiming that no Chicago writer could become famous until he had departed the gem of the prai ries" (3-4). He decides to stay in Chicago partly because he does not want to lose "his native accent and vision" (4).8 Shortly after this passage, however, Purdy tells us that Eustace is from northern Michigan, which means that his accent is not quite the accent of Chicago, and, in the passage from which I quoted earlier, that he is still unaccustomed to Chicago's ethnic diversity, a diversity Purdy introduces as "the sounds of Yiddish," a text for which Eustace could never hope to provide a paraphrase. The reference to Yiddish and the subsequent references to Negroes and Poles suggest that there may be no single Chicago accent in any case and that to move about in Chicago is to hear a variety of accents. Similarly, Eustace's vision takes in the different ethnic and racial groups that inhabit Chicago without, it would appear, being able to make anything of them in a literary sense. Eustace wants to write an American poem, and perhaps even the American poem, on American subjects and from his own position as an American subject, but many of the American subjects he sees from his window are literally and figuratively beneath his notice, at least in a literary sense. Shortly after this passage and just before the return of Carla begins the narra tive proper, Purdy says that Eustace is alone in the apartment "writing as usual on</page><page sequence="7">108 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 his long poem about original stock' in America" (5). The inverted commas around the phrase presumably indicate that this is Eustace's own description of his work, but to me they also signal that the phrase will be difficult to paraphrase. Despite the fact that he later says to Carla that he is "crazy about Indians" (12), it does not seem likely that they are what he means by original stock. In the second chapter, we are told of an occasion before his marriage when Eustace held up his hand and said "Look at that classic American hand ... pure stock from back to the Indians" (23). While the phrase could imply that he is claiming descent from the Indians, it seems much more likely that he is making a distinction between his family and the Indians: his point is surely that his family has been in America since the earliest days of European immigration. Eustace is pure in the sense that he is not Indian, black, Jewish, or Polish (for instance). In the context of the novel, then, original stock must mean white, Christian Americans of British descent, which is to say that Eustace's poem is perhaps more about northern Michigan than about Chicago. There is even a further problem with the phrase. Eustace's explanation for his lack of success as a writer is primarily economic: as he sees it, writing is a commodity that can be monopolized like any other. It is therefore all the more remarkable that he does not appear to see the ambiguity of the word "stock," as it was stock, both in the sense of railways and in the sense of livestock, that made Chicago so rich and that led directly or indirectly to the immigrations of which Eustace himself is a part. Eustace Chisholm, then, is the main character of a novel he could not possibly have written. The events of the narrative do not provide what he would consider to be subject matter, just as the streets around his apartment are full of people who could not find a place in his poem. As if to underline his separation from the world around him, he is learning Greek from Amos. When he tells his wife this she asks if it is ancient or modern Greek, at which he abuses her and then turns to Clayton to ask "Did you ever know me to be interested in anything modern?" (18). The distinction between the two forms of Greek is not purely a linguistic or academic matter as Chicago had and has a sizable Greek community. Modern Greek could conceivably be a practical choice in Chicago. In choosing ancient Greek, Eustace once again turns his back on the city about which he is ostensibly writing and opts for the long-dead world that is represented in the novel's first paragraph by the caryatids, who can be seen as petrified human beings weighed down by classical learning. It is just possible that Eustace would argue that as our narrative tradition could be said to begin with Homer, ancient Greek would be helpful in writing a narrative poem, but it should be clear to readers of the novel that simply getting out more would be of much greater help to him. In any case, although Eustace never gets anywhere with ancient Greek he also never abandons the way of think ing that leads him to prefer ancient Greek to modern Greek or to Yiddish or to the American vernaculars that surround him but which are not his "native accent." Eustace sees himself as an authentic Chicagoan and he might even describe his poem as a fuller and more explanatory version of the real history of his adopted</page><page sequence="8">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 109 city?as a paraphrase, that is?but it seems clear even by this very early point in the narrative that his poem has only a tenuous connection with the place that is its subject. Tellingly, Eustace's other gift is the gift of prophecy, which we could see as a way to paraphrase the future. Much of the middle part of the novel details Eustace's ultimately successful attempts to rid himself of this gift, perhaps partly because of the way in which it involves him in daily life. If we focus on Eustace's attitudes towards his writing and his prophecy we can read the novel as telling the story of a man's gradual retreat from the world around him: he moves from being at least potentially a participant in life to being a spectator to it. The other character in Eustace Chisholm and the Works who has artistic preten sions is the painter Maureen O'Dell, whose face is "as primitive as her work" (72). Purdy indicates that her attitude to American subject matter is similar to Eustace's. In addition to Maureen's renown as a "'serious fucker'" (72), she is "well-known (at least in Chicago) for her oils" (71-72). Although she is a more successful artist than Eustace, her fame is still only local, either because painting, like writing, is a New York monopoly or, more probably, because of the narrowness of her vision. Purdy introduces us to her paintings in his description of her waiting-room (so called because "nearly everybody who 'waited' there ended up in bed with her" [68]): This room contained a collection of ancient rockers, wood statues of Indians and of blackamoors holding rings for horses. There were also her own unsold oils whose sub jects ranged from Maureen herself at midnight to scenes of ruined slaughter-houses, pool-room interiors, prairies and corn fields, skies and lawns without depth or perspec tive. On the floor and walls of the rooms battered linoleum and calcimine, respectively, met in grimy embrace (68-69). The description of the paintings is an example of paraphrase, as is the brilliant last sentence of this passage, which, with its superfluous adverb, provides a further paraphrase: grimy embraces, as we have already learnt, are Maureen's specialty. My interest here is really in the objects in Maureen's studio, however, objects that I understand as demonstrating that her ideas of what her art should be are similar to Eustace's ideas about his own art. The items in this list are divided into two categories: things she has collected and her oil paintings, or things that are not art and things that are art. Suggesting rural or small-town leisure as they do, the old rocking chairs are incongruous in the context of the notably run-down urban living spaces described in the novel. The statues seem to imply that Maureen has the same fascination with non-white people that Eustace has; like the rocking chairs, they seem old-fashioned, a point that Purdy emphasizes in his use of "blackamoor." Considering as a whole the objects in her studio that are not art, we can see that they are all things originally associated with use (as the statues of Indians are pre sumably the statues once common in front of tobacconists) but now outmoded. While the statues of blackamoors probably appear to have no function at all beyond promoting racism, they do commemorate what was once a common occupation for black men under slavery (and after) before the invention of the automobile. In each case, then, these objects demonstrate the extent to which daily life has changed in</page><page sequence="9">110 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 America and the statues suggest that one of the important changes has come in American attitudes about race. Maureen's decision to collect these items may represent a fascination with the past and even a nostalgia for it. Certainly, the subject matter of her paintings indicates that she has not entirely moved into contemporary America. Ruined slaughter-houses could be said to be a timely subject, as much of Chicago's wealth came from its abattoirs and by the time the novel takes place the golden age of slaughter was over. Pool-rooms would also seem to point to a recent setting. Both of these, as well as lawns, could just as easily be set in a small town like the one Eustace comes from as in a major city, however, and the prairies and cornfields Maureen paints could only be found in the countryside. Maureen's subject as an artist appears to be the same as Eustace's: native stock. In fact, with the possible exception of the pool-room interiors hers is an art without humans at all. Except, of course, herself, and the fact that she is her only human subject emphasizes her artistic solipsism, something she shares with Eustace. The contrast between her paintings and the statues of Indians and blackamoors emphasizes that for her, as for Eustace, the racial diversity of a city like Chicago is not an American subject in the artistic sense. In this passage, seeking to represent non-white people is one of the signs of naive or folk art, which would be another category in which to place the objects Maureen collects. The juxtaposition of the two classes of object in this passage presents the paintings as serious art; similarly, the fact that Eustace's poem is written on a newspaper sets up a distinction between serious writing and writing intended merely for use. Nevertheless, in both cases the presence of other works in the same medium could also be taken to suggest the foolishness of the distinction and to give some indication of the range of things left out, things not considered sufficiently serious to form the subject of a work of art. I said earlier that Eustace was the main character of the novel, but it is not entirely true to say that he is its eponymous character. The novel is called Eustace Chisholm and the Works, and the title (the first paraphrase we encounter) is ambigu ous. As Marie-Claude Profit points out in her book on Purdy, "the coordination by and' and the use of'the' make the connection between the character named and the works imprecise: are they his? If yes, why the distancing? The question introduces the problem of the responsibility (or irresponsibility) of an author with regard to a work that escapes him" (14). I would argue that it is Eustace's fear of responsibility that makes him reluctant to be a prophet. In any case, the word "works" is ambigu ous; it appears to mean "collected writings," but in colloquial speech it also has the meaning "everything."The works could be all the things that Eustace sees and hears and reads about but does not put in his own writing, and the title could be drawing our attention to the inadequacy of his writing as a paraphrase. The distancing Profit speaks of might be found in Eustace's decision to write high art, rather than poetry that is a real response to the world around him. The title thus presents us not with two related nouns but rather with two separate ones, as the course of the narrative makes clear. We could even say that to read the novel is to understand the title as a narrative in itself: Part One, Eustace Chisholm; Part Two, The Works. As Purdy's</page><page sequence="10">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 111 story progresses Eustace becomes one of us: a reader rather than a writer, someone who depends on a paraphrase of events rather than the person who provides the paraphrase. Perhaps the clearest indication of the text as a repudiation of Eustace's literary ideas is that what he and we come increasingly to depend on are letters: in this case, essentially utilitarian paraphrases of American life. Eustace's transformation into a reader begins when he switches from poetry to prose shortly after Maureen's horrific abortion. By chance, Eustace finds Clay ton's book of receipts and writes in it his own version of what Amos has told him about the abortion (81). In other words, Eustace turns to paraphrase. The para graph Purdy gives us is enough to undermine our belief in Eustace as a writer, as Purdy's description of the abortion is an almost unbearably effective compound of gore and comedy, while Eustace's version is stilted and uneffective. Perhaps more significantly, although Eustace is still writing over other texts, his paragraph shows that his subject matter has changed from his private ideas about what America is to current events of interest to people he actually knows. One way to describe this is to say that his writing has come to resemble the newspapers which were once important to him only as a source of paper. Considered from this point of view, Eustace's choice of writing material here is surely significant. Now his writing covers and renders illegible a financial document rather than a record of current events. Furthermore, as Clayton left the book behind, we can assume that the information in this book of receipts is no longer current: Eustace's writing may now, for the first time, be more relevant to everyday life than the writing with which it is juxtaposed. Not many pages after this, Purdy tells us that Eustace had once remarked to Amos that "it was paper ... that he was really queer for" (119). Purdy gives us this information because Eustace has just bought (for twenty-five cents) a pile of papers belonging to Amos, including letters from his mother (Cousin Ida), Greek lessons, and Daniel's diary. Shortly after this, he receives a letter from Daniel, who is now in the army; Eustace answers, and from this point on his writing is confined to the exchange of letters with Daniel. These events open the second section of the novel and signal that Eustace is now a reader, just as the emphasis at the beginning of the first section of the novel was on Eustace as a writer, and just as the emphasis at the beginning of the third section of the novel is on Eustace as a reader of letters, something that it turns out has always been an important part of his life. These letters are either ones he finds in the street or, as is the case in his correspondence with Daniel, ones that people write to him. While Eustace does answer at least some of the letters he gets, as a writer he is now reactive rather than creative: let ters, after all, (or, at least, the letters that Eustace receives) are mainly commentary and paraphrase. The emphasis in the novel's short epilogue is on Eustace's recognition of the fact that he is now a reader rather than a writer. In it, he receives three letters from the Army. The first informs him that he has been declared unfit to enlist; the second that Daniel has been seriously injured; the third that "Private Daniel Haws had died of injuries sustained in basic training" (251). This second and third letters are the</page><page sequence="11">112 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 important ones, partly because in relation to Purdy's horrifying narrative of Daniel's last days the letters provide the novel's most extreme example of the inadequacy of paraphrase. Nevertheless, Purdy says that despite his "ordinarily poor memory, Eustace Chisholm could recite the exact contents of those prosaically worded Army communications, while he would stumble if he recited Shakespeare or Virgil's lines, his favorite of all, as translated by Dryden" (251). These paraphrases, that is to say, have replaced literature for him. The lines Purdy quotes from Virgil are: I know thee, Love! in deserts thou wert bred, And at the dugs of savage Tigers fed; Alien of birth, usurper of the plains! (252) This is Dryden's remarkably free translation of lines 34-45 of the eighth eclogue. Here is a more literal one: "now I know what love is: Tmaros or Rhodope or the farthest Garamantes brought him forth on naked rocks, a boy not of our race or blood." Virgil himself based this passage on lines from Theocritus'third idyll: "now I know Love ? a fierce god; indeed he fed at a lioness's dugs and was raised in a forest" (III. 15-16). Dryden's translation can be described as what he himself called "Paraphrase, or Translation with Latitude, where the Authour is kept in view by the Translator, so as never to be lost, but his words are not so strictly follow'd as his sense; and that too is admitted to be amplyfied, but not alter'd" (114). Of course, in a sense all translation is paraphrase (and vice versa), but the passage from Dryden usefully draws our attention to the question, so central to Eustace Chisholm and the Works, of the fidelity of the paraphrase to the thing that is paraphrased. By the end of the novel, paraphrasing?an activity that, as Crow suggests, is central to our experience of art?is shown to be always, perhaps inherently, inadequate. The idea that love is cruel has an obvious application to the events of the novel and, in particular, to the fate of Daniel Haws, but what is striking here is that this is clearly the most literary moment in Eustace Chisholm and the Works, a novel that has not made use of many allusions. The lines Purdy cites form part of a chain of allusions going through Dryden and Virgil to Theocritus; that Dryden could be said to be translating Theocritus rather than Virgil complicates this chain. The dramatic irony in the relation of this passage to its context in Purdy's novel is that Eustace would once have seen himself as participating in this tradition, but that it only becomes present in the narrative at the point at which Eustace is about to renounce writing literature altogether. In other words, the great literature of the past is no longer a mark of poetic excellence to which he might aspire?and, in fact, he cannot even remember it very well?but only a comment on his own experience or the experience of the people he knows. Rather than be a creator of literature, he can now only be its subject, and his relative powerlessness is empha sized because he is no longer even the main subject of the novel. For some time before this, Daniel has been the focus both of Purdy's writing and of the violent marking and incising that is Captain Stadger's substitute for or parody of writing.9 Stadger's treatment of Daniel is also a paraphrase, and in some ways perhaps the most important one of the novel. Here, the violence one man inflicts on another is</page><page sequence="12">Purdy's Art of Paraphrase 113 a paraphrase for the intense sexual desire that cannot be expressed; what is more, Stadger's mutilation of Daniel can be read as a paraphrase of Daniel's own inability to show his love for Amos. The book ends with a scene in which Eustace gets out of bed to check on his poems, lights a match to see where he is going, and sets fire to the newspapers on which his poems are written. He also sets fire to his dressing gown and in the ensuing confusion everything is burnt to ashes except "a large spread of a long newspaper account, with copious pictures of the wedding of Reuben Masterson and Maureen O'Dell" (252).The people Eustace knew never seemed likely to make it into his poem, but we now learn that they did make it into the paper. Eustace's poetry covered over the newspapers stories and presumably made them illegible; the survival of at least this one item presents his art as ephemeral, a word that in its original meaning would seem to have been coined expressly for newspapers; now, however, newspapers themselves, the matter-of-fact paraphrases of daily events beneath Eustace's notice, are presented as durable: part of the newspaper remains, while the poems are gone. The effect of the fire on Eustace is that he announces to Carla that he has given up poetry: "I'm not a writer, that's my news, never was, and never will be" (253). Fittingly, even his choice of words in his renunciation demonstrates a preference for news over literature. At the very end of the novel, we learn that Eustace gives up more than just his poetry. The power of the surviving newspaper item is demonstrated in the final sentence: Staring at her dumbly, he stirred, pulled her head down toward his mouth, covered her neck with silent kisses and then slowly, like all the sleepwalkers in the world, took her down the long hall to their bed, held her to him, accepted her first coldness as she had for so long accepted his, and then warmed her with a kind of ravening love. (253) As if responding to the equally unlikely pairing off of Reuben and Maureen, Eustace finally accepts the role as husband that he has been fending off since Carlas return at the beginning of the novel (and probably since their wedding) and renounces his sexual interest in men. Out of the disreputable people who make up his cast of characters, Purdy finally succeeds in producing two mixed-sex couples. As a result, Eustace Chisholm and the Works ends in a way that moves the narrative closer to the sort of narrative considered suitable for inclusion in a newspaper. Nevertheless, the fact that both men could be described as homosexual and both women could be described as promiscuous suggests the continuing inad equacy of journalistic paraphrases of life. While Eustace's poetry may never have been much of an alternative to conventional rules of what is fit to print, he and many of the novel's other characters did seem to be new American subjects, ones not previously part either of American literature or of American journalism. Still, all is not lost. Newspapers have seemed to be a corrective in the novel, to indicate a wider world than Eustace can accommodate, but in the last sentence we learn that newspapers are not enough. When Purdy tells us that Eustace warms Carla "with a kind of ravening love" he alludes to the lines from Dryden (and Virgil and</page><page sequence="13">114 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 31, Number 3 Theocritus) quoted on the previous page. Despite the pessimistic view of high culture with which the book begins, and although it is no longer part of Eustace's life, poetry is perhaps still relevant.10 The sheer excess of poetry, marked here by the incommensurateness of the elevated (and now, to us, archaic) diction of Dryden's lines with the rather sordid situation at the end of the novel, paradoxically makes it a suitable paraphrase for events that do not?and that possibly cannot?fit into our paradigm of realism.

In the passage in which Daniel, who has been tortured by Stadger, walks out of the woods "carrying his bowels in his hands like provisions" (246), I see a further reference to Lessing's Laocoon, this time to the notorious passage on Hottentot standards of beauty. The Hottentot women, Lessing tells us, decorate themselves in entrails: "F?sse und Arme mit frischem Ged?rme umwunden" (feet and arms enwrapped in fresh intestines; chapter XXV, 175). 10.
