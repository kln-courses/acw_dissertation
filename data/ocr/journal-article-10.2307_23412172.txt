Museum and archival data as well as published information (colonial lenses notwithstanding) have provided sources for research. The significations of terminology, shell material, and processes of production, binding, and imaging of the shell valuables on barava openwork plaques all con tribute to an identity as social constructs for sticks with shell valuables during the nineteenth and early twen tieth centuries. Introduction This paper deals with two types of entities: object clusters and image clusters from Western Solomon Islands. Object clusters belong to the type known as serembule or vovoso, sticks to which shell rings and other shell ornaments have been lashed (Figs 1-3). Image clusters are featured on openwork plaques commonly known as barava (Figs 4-6).' They are characterized by representations of rings and anthro pomorphic figures. The openwork plaques are always fashioned from clam shell and their height ranees from about 30 to 50 cm, considerably greater than the smaller shell plaques that decorate serembule/vovoso. Both sticks and plaques functioned as social markers, especially in the context of war and head hunting during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Both are still being produced today. They have become collectors items (especially the plaques). Only recently have the sticks become 'art objects' for Westerners (see note 4). A single paper cannot do justice to these two types of objects but both must be considered here since they are interrelated in many ways. For in stance, the shell rings that were the most common decorative component of the sticks were prominent in the imagery of openwork plaques. The small shell plaques attached to the sticks also bear resemblances to the larger barava plaques. Further connections in elude a common material, clam shell, as well as simi lar methods of production and the terms used for them. Both sticks and plaques feature anthropomor phic images but in different ways. On the openwork plaques recognizable figures appear singly, in groups or in rows. Not so for the sticks but their presence is incorporated through the use of valuables which were taken from the widely recognized collective property oî particular social groups, a selection determined by designated group members and assembled so as to signify a social construct. Serembule/vovoso are only one type of stick with shell valuables from Western Province. In the Marovo Lagoon district of New Georgia island an other stick with shell valuables called piniri shares with serembule/vovoso not only the basic form of valuables attached to sticks but also a process of con struction, anthropomorphic representation and associ ation with the socio-spirit world. In Marovo, a ritual involving sticks with shell valuables called va chopele evokes the concept of insertion or penetra tion. Present particularly in times of war through out the western islands were shell valuables project ing from the upraised prows of war canoes (Fig. 7). They were attached to sticks concealed within the two halves or a canoe prow. Flaque imagery also re curs among certain canoe ornaments (cf. Fig. 9). The ethnographic literature constantly uses the terms serembule and vovoso for what appears to be the same type of object. This is why I have em ployed the combined term serembule/vovoso. How ever, the evidence suggests that these terms may have reflected conceptual and functional differences be tween the two types, not just linguistic discrepancies 19</page><page sequence="2">owing to differing island provenances. Four individu als are responsible for the early relevant documenta tion, both published and unpublished: A.M. Hocart, T.A. Joyce, J. Edge-Partington and C.M. Woodford. All wrote during the early twentieth century. I was able to supplement some of their information through field research in 2005.2 Basic Description Each serembule/vovoso consists of a stick to which shell objects are tightly bound with a vine, possibly the vine termed asama. Present on every serembule/vovoso are shell rings and a spiral cross section of a cone-shaped shell (sp. Terebridae muscu lata) which is fastened to the top of each stick. The latter was termed rango (Roviana Lagoon, New Georgia; = ragoso or rago, Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia; rago, Simbo island). Two types of small shell plaques appear with varying frequency on serembule/vovoso. Triangular clam shell plaques termed barava (also the name of the larger clam shell openwork plaques) are found on many and rectangu lar plaques called pangosia are tied to some but by no means all. Examples in Museum Collections Serembule/vovoso exist in several museum collec tions. Rings and other valuables unattached to the sticks are much more in evidence not only in mu seum collections but also in the Solomon Islands where today they may belong to family treasuries or be placed on graves. Three sticks that have retained the attached rings and other valuables belong to the British Museum. They, along with one in the Auck land Museum, are the earliest to have been acquired and documented (Figs. 1 and 2). They were obtained in Roviana, New Georgia island (cf. Edge-Partington and Joyce 1904). Those in the Kulturen Museum, Basel were taken from the Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia, by Eugen Paravicini in 1929 (Museum cat. Vb7477-9). A piniri stick with shell barava removed from Marovo by the 'Korrigane' expedition in 1935 is now in the Musée du Quai Branly, Paris (71.1961.103.50; de Coppet 2001:135, Fig. 37). The Field Museum, Chicago (276854), American Mu seum of Natural History (80.0/9798), and Solomon Islands National Museum (74.571) (Fig. 3) hold three more examples. It is impossible to determine whether the numerous individual rings, small triangular bar ava plaques and other small plaques in museum col lections had ever been lashed to sticks. Sticks and the vines used for lashing are not as durable as the shell pieces and may have decayed and been discarded. New vines have occasionally been employed to re-as semble old configurations on the sticks (e.g. Auck land 15185) (rig.2). Three sticks with shell valuables were featured in an exhibition in the Carlier Gallery in Paris in 2005 (Carlier 2005:72). Collection data was not supplied for this exhibition. Recorded Data: Terminology and Function Two sources furnish seemingly conflicting evidence as to the definition of serembule. Hingova, chief (big-man) of Roviana (New Georgia) during the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, gave the earli est-recorded evidence to C.M. Woodford, first Dis trict Commissioner of the then British Solomon Islands. Woodford showed Hingova an article written by Edge-Partington and Joyce in 1904 that docu mented the four sticks taken from Kolokongo village, Roviana Lagoon, now divided between the British and Auckland Museums. Higova reportedly called these sticks 'serenbule'. According to Hingova, they were placed in the bow of a war canoe during a war expedition. At other times, he claimed, they were 'stuck in the ground' in funerary houses 'where the skulls were kept' (Woodford papers 4/29/2 Bundle 151(3), Australian National University). Woodford's file notes were revised for publication to indicate that the sticks were 'stuck in the ground beneath, or in close proximity to, the small huts or shelters in which the skull of deceased natives are kept' (Woodford 1905: 38-9). The sticks collected by Paravicini were labelled 'grave ornaments' (Kulturen Museum acces sion files.) Other recorded references to serembule ex pand our knowledge of their cultural role. In 1908, on bimDo island, a.m. Hocart recorded that serembule tamasa was a 'hiF (clam) shell worn round the neck. Serembule, Hocart noted, 'equals barava'. Placement of a serembule in a canoe guaranteed 'no rain, wind' (Hocart diary 1908:1205, Alexander Turnbull Li brary). In the languages of Simbo and Roviana, mbule (pule) means 'calm, peaceful, fine' as in calm weather or 'to make peace' (Lanyon-Orgill 1969:7; * * Clivai 11VUOV 1 J-T S . Il), i IlW |_/1 Cl 1A ^ tf e - \J1, 111 VVVJUU ford's notes, sera, provides a clue to the meaning. In Marovo, sera refers to a 'village shore, landing place, 20</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1. Three serembule: British Museum 1904.06-21.3 (left) and 1904.06-21.5 (center); Auckland Museum 15185 (right). All three come from the Roviana Lagoon, New Georgia Island, and were obtained on a 'punitive' voyage of H.M.S. Royalist, 1901 by Capt. Davis. This historic pho tograph was published by Joyce and Edge-Partington in 1904. Shown to Hingova, chief of Roviana by C.M.

A serembule or serambule (either the indi vidual ornament or ornament cluster on stick) when placed in a canoe could guarantee peaceful weather or other conditions enabling passage to a populated shore. about vovoso on Simbo Island. They were sticks 'of ekolo wood' to which were bound shell rings and or naments (pangosia, mbulau, rango) (Hocart 1931:309). Vovoso bore personal names and be longed to specific districts and/or islands. When fas tened to a war canoe, their presence guaranteed a successful raid. ] he term serembule was evidently applicable to both individual ornaments and sticks with clusters of shell valuables. The reasons for the dual usage (if indeed, that is what it was) are not exactly clear. In advertent miscommunication might have occurred in Woodford's case. That is to say, if in asking for the name of a stick with attached valuables he had ges tured toward one of the individual ornaments on the stick, Hingova might have provided the name of that ornament. Woodford, on the other hand, might have assumed that the term applied to the entire ensemble. Another reason tor the use ot the term serem bule may well have been that its guarantee of peace and calm in the face of adversity would be a not inap propriate interpretation to convey to Westerners like Woodford. The Rev. E. C. Leadley, who obtained a stick with shell valuables now in the Solomon Islands National Museum (74.571), called the stick serem bule. He could have been given this term by an in formant for the same reason. However, there may have been no contradiction in applying the same term to single and plural items. The use of a stick with shell valuables in contrast to a single ornament may have had greater efficacy and would have depended upon the desired increase in value/power, depending upon me ponuco-sociai aemanas 01 a particular situ ation. Vovoso The term vovoso seems to have implied a broader scope of power applications for sticks with shell valuables than sercmbule, including metaphoric im plications of social binding pertinent to war-related situations as well as hshing expeditions. In the con text of bonito fishing it referred to a string that bound a fishhook to its main support (Hocart field diary 76; 1935:102). Primarily in the context of war it was a 'charm' consisting of a stick to which are lashed shell rings and shell valuables (Lanyon-Orgill ibid: 147). I he two seemingly disparate objects share the teature of binding. Hocart recorded fairly extensive information Ritual practices surrounded vovoso from construction to installation in a canoe. Hocart recorded the names of certain men who were makers of vovoso: Sawena, Kundu, and Kundu's father Mbola. Before a war canoe departed, food offerings were made to the vovoso and, by extension, to the spirits of all deceased chiefs. These would be accom panied by statements such as, 'This is the pig for you, the spirits of departed chiefs, the vovoso, and be effi cacious for this canoe, and may we put on board the men'. A shell ring was also offered to the vovoso after it was fastened in the canoe. An artist named Kundakolo (also referred to as Kunda) made a draw ing for Hocart showing a vovoso flanked by two men 'making vovoso, that is, performing a ceremony on it. Plenty of rings lie at its feet' (Hocart 1931:310-11, Fig. 11). All of these activities combined to transmit power or agency to the vovoso. The only other pertinent recorded comments :ome from Paravicini. In the Marovo Lagoon area, New Georgia, specialists made vovoso. They were trained for this work from boyhood and underwent special taboo procedures during the construction process. They ate specially prepared meals and drank water from a brook where no one else could drink. Taro and yams for their consumption were cultivated separately from other crops (Paravicini 1931:182). Returning to Hocart s narrative: war was ap parently not the only occasion requiring the agency Df vovoso, as the following chant reveals: 'be effica cious in the meeting at sea, be efficacious in the going up ... in the catching [of crabs] ... in the turtling canoe, in the fishing canoe ... in the fish trap . . in the bonito fishing . . Human victims emerge is a dominant goal, for the chant concludes with 'ef feet that we kill two at once: grant a maiden killing; grant a chief's wife as victim; grant a chief as victim; grant a chief as victim; grant some booty' (Hocart 1931:310-11). Upon return from a war expedition, Hocart "eports, crew members 'bail out the canoe ceremoni ally. This is called lipa vovoso or "bail canoe" [the 22</page><page sequence="5">canoe is thus referred to explicitly as vovoso]. They did this four times, Kunda pronouncing the following chant: "Come down, come down the vovoso, come down sit on the land, come down and sit in the skull house; abide. When we depart, we shall put thee on board" . . . ' (314). Kunda allegedly told Hocart that only he, Kunda, and someone known as Mbeti were privileged to remove the vovoso from a canoe. The vovoso was set up by a shrine in Pesi beside a stele belonging to the vovoso and called vagore vovoso, or take down vovoso . Largo was then removed trom the canoe, and the vovoso was left beside the shrine for three days. Kunda then took it up to a skull house where he utters words like this: "Go up and sit. Go up, be angry! Go up, be incensed. Go up, kill. Go up, be true" . . . When the chief says "Let us go, come down, embark , Kunda handed the vovoso over to the mortuary priest who put it in the skull house' (314). Paravicini illustrates a cave at Marovo where vovoso were kept (1931, fig. 84). In one instance, Hocart reports, a vovoso named Crocodile, the same name that was given to the canoe in which it had resided, was broken up by the mortuary priest who hung the broken fragments on the rafters of the skull house. 'The canoe was allowed to rot' (Hocart 1931:3191. This aooears to be another instance of vovoso being conceived of in the same way as a canoe. A vovoso was evidently a device which facil itated the agency of ancestral spirits in guaranteeing the successful acquisition of victims of war as well as food. Use of the same term for the vine ('string') that bound a fishhook to its base points to a common metaphorical binding function of consumption and conquering processes (i.e. fishing and war/headhunt ing), two processes so necessary formerly for the continued welfare of a people. The tasks were ac complished through the combined efforts of men and the power of their ancestors. Shell valuables bound to a vovoso might well have been the family property of the leader of an expedition or other powerful men from the same social group, to which probably also belonged the ritual experts who handled the vovoso. The valuables, bound or lashed to the stick, cemented the link between ancestral and human agency - all the more reason to examine below each type of valu able individually following a discussion ot the mate rials from which they are constructed. In 2005, in the Roviana Lagoon, New Geor gia Island, 1 spoke with Faletau Leve of Munda about sticks with shell valuables. He did not recognize the term serembule. For him vovoso was the only name for sticks with shell valuables. He called the sticks vovoso virivirikana. Virivinkana referred to a cap tured enemy (kana) who was twisted in a rope; the word viriviri referred to a twisting rope. Leve demon strated graphically with his hands how the rope would be twisted around a victim s neck (personal communication, September 19, 2005). Fig. 3. Serembule. Solomon Islands National Museum 74571. Given by the Rev. E.C. Leadley. H. 88.5 cm. Photo by D. Waite. In the Marovo Lagoon, New Georgia, a stick with shell valuables termed piniri resembles serem bule/vovoso but the major documented example in the Musée du Quai Branly (cat. 71.1961.6-21.33-5) consists of five triangular barava ornaments but has 23</page><page sequence="6">Rango (Terebndae musculata) no (surviving?) shell rings, pangosia plaques or rango shell. Data acquired by members of the 'Korrigane' expedition in 1935 indicated that it was attached en guise d'autel [like an altar] to the prow of a canoe during a headhunting expedition' (de Coppet:135). Liana vine, locally called amasa, was used for the lashing. The plaques were probably ground from shell. The word piniri is a noun formed from the verb piri, which means to tie or lash (Hviding, personal communication 2/2/06). The object was thus defined by a word, which signifies process, i.e. the binding process. Also at Marovo, there has long existed the va chopele ritual, the offering of shells on a stick placed at a shrine to 'appease the spiritual presences in the place and to open up the area for human occu pation and uses'; va chopele translates as 'to insert' (Hviding 1996:422). Lastly, in this survey of sticks with shell valuables, we return to Hocart who used the phrase 'four chiefly sticks' as a metaphor for canoes. The phrase belonged to a chant recited on Simbo at a fu neral, and Hocart states that the phrase 'four chiefly sticks' is a 'periphrasis for canoe' (Hocart 1922:88). This metaphoric association may have some connec tion to the presence of a stick with triangular (some times closer to rectangular) shell barava within the halves of a war canoe prow. Very few of these exist in museum collections. One surviving example is in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford (2005.82.1; see Fig. 7). This positioning of a stick with shell valuables fuses it with the canoe and makes it and the canoe ap pear to be one. A glimpse of the end of one such con cealed stick appears in a photograph taken by Claus Bager Nielsen of a canoe prow at Chubikope in Marovo in 1994-5 (Nielsen 2005: plate opposite p. 14; cf. Somerville 1897:279). Since war canoes were commanded, and often owned, by chiefs or other group leaders this stick with valuables might be said to signify the agency or power of a living chief, whereas serembule/vovoso allude to, or embody, the power of deceased chiefs. Reinforcement for this interpretation will come from further examination of the shell materials used to make the valuables. Two particular shells probably contributed considerable agency. One was the Tridacna gigas clam and the other was the Tere bridae musculata or rango shell at the top of each serembule/vovoso. The spiral cross-section of a rango (= rao, rago, ragoso) shell was, as stated, an essential feature of every serembule/vovoso. Like shell rings, rango were also attached to other objects, notably skull houses and powerful charms known as ligomo. Lenyon Orgill defines the 'rano' used on Simbo island as a 'long spiral shell rubbed down on both sides of the long axis' and usually hung on skull houses (Lanyon Orgill 1969:121). Hviding's definition of rago from Marovo includes strong suggestions of empower ment. Rago, he reports, is the local name of a group of gastropods, fam. Mitridae, Terebridae and Carithi dae. it is also the generic name tor a group or sand creepers, including mitre and auger shells. The shells 'are regarded as a potential hazard for people who walk in sandy shallows because a foot pierced by the sharp pointed end of a rago easily becomes infected' (Hviding 2005:78). Herein lies one possible source of the symbolic potency of a rago shell; it can stab (i.e. like a weapon) and can cause infection. At Marovo Lagoon the rago ligomo (Terebra crenulata) has a particular ritual usage alluded to in the name ligomo. The walls of this shell are 'ground down until only the spiraling center section is left to be used as the main component of the hgomo, a very important rit ual object...' (78). Clam Shell - the Giant Clams (Tridacnidae) Seven species of giant clam, or Tridacnidae, exist in the Pacific and South Asia. They range in size from fifteen centimeters to over a meter in length (Lucas 1988:21 ff; Hviding 2005:74). Tridacna gigas (here alter referred to as I. gigas) is the largest and in many ways the most significant for shell rings and both types of barava (the small triangular plaques and the larger openwork plaques) (Fig. 10). The social life of T. gigas makes quite clear the values that could be attached to this material and the use to which it is put. The clams are strikingly so cial and sexually very productive, as indicated partie ularly in the recorded observations ot Harold Jimura of Chea village, Marovo Lagoon. Jimura has done a lot or diving in the Marovo Lagoon and has seen the T. gigas {ose) at first hand many times. Before 1983, when clam harvesters from Taiwan virtually wiped out T. gigas at Marovo, they lived 'in dense groups irom tive to ten and sometimes as many as twenty or thirty, all in one place . . . sitting down in the stag 24</page><page sequence="7">Individual Shell Valuables: Rango, Shell Rings, Triangular Barava Plaques, Pangosia horn thickets on the ocean-facing side of the barrier reef. Groups of ose were found particularly in and around passages through the reeî from the ocean to the lagoon . . . This is the way they prefer to live . . . many together in places like that. . (cited in Hvid ing 1993:33). Jimura describes the clams as highly social beings, an ideal productive and interactive so ciety. From a reproductive perspective, all giant clams become sexually mature as males at two or more years of age and subsequently become her maphrodites. Breeding cycles extend throughout the year at lower latitudes and during the summer months at higher latitudes. Huge numbers of sperma tozoa and eggs are released: 'the act of releasing . . . is vigorous with a series of strong explosions through the excurrent aperture. Giant clams can respond to the presence of eggs in the water by sperm release within a few minutes . . . [TJhere may be a chain re action of clams detecting eggs, releasing sperms, and then, in turn, releasing eggs which will stimulate other clams down current' (Lucas 1988:31). Close socialization and powerful fertilization (with more than a hint of masculine action or control) are augmented by another factor, namely the visual appearance of a giant clam with its suggestively fern inine, slightly open lips or edges, which have pro vided Marovo Islanders with manifold sexual metaphors and other connotations (Hviding 1993:27). These indications and implications of sexual potency can be seen as a source of the power embedded in clam shell artifacts, a power that defines them and their signiticatory potency within male-dominated ritual, especially war-related activities. It also ex plains the highly taboo nature ot T. gigas, especially for women (Hviding ibid.). In addition to rings and plaques, clam shell could be used for drinking water containers, rattles and even adzes. In Marovo and Roviana, New ueorgia, names tor iriaacna maxima (chavi and peqopeqo respectively) mean 'adze'. Eld ers on New Georgia claim that in olden times, i. maxima shells were used for smaller adze blades be cause they had the right size and shape (needing little modification) and were regarded as denser and more durable than other types otlridaena (Hviding 1993:26). The material of clam shell, thus, has long constituted a crucial presence within a constellation of empowered objects. (i) Rango Rango was one of the two major types of shells with agency found on serembule/vovoso (see above). A rango topped each cluster 01 shell valuables on the sticks. In addition to the innate properties of the shell, its presence on the charm called ligomo at Marovo, Roviana, and on Simbo and other western islands may well have influenced or motivated its incorpora tion on serembule/vovoso. For that matter, rango irom a particularly successful or enective hgomo could well have been chosen for a serembule/vovoso in order to increase its power. Recorded comments from the Rev. E.C. Leadley about a ligomo from Roviana in the Solomon islands National Museum ( /4.5 IZ) reveal the power of this object. It has the form of a tiny bas ket made of asama vine (used in multiple contexts for binding including on serembule/vovoso); to it are at tached rango shells and small shell rings. The basket once contained the tooth of a prominent deceased chief. 'The ligomo is the greatest power of a leading chief' and was 'attached to the handle of a lave or shield. When fighting began, it was taken from the shield and put around the wearer's neck so that he could hear [i.e. hear the words of the ligomo] and ask the ligomo if the enemy was coming or not. . . The name of the parts of the ligomo are ligomo, vavoso, virivirikame...' (Solomon Islands National Museum accession files 74.572; cf. Wall 1974:35, îllus. 2; Neich &amp; Pereira 2004:102; Auckland Museum 15241; Waite 2008:79, 80 and plate 40). Reiteration of material, process and nomenclature (e.g. vavoso, viriviriKana; unK iigomo 10 sucks who such valu ables. (ii) Shell Rings Shell rings of small and moderate size were ubiqui tous on serembule/vovoso but conspicuously absent from piniri (if the example in the Branly Museum is any indication). Most were produced from clam shell through a process ot drilling and abrading, not carv ing. Early accounts of their manufacture indicate that a section ot shell was lirst broken oft so as to con form roughly to the outer dimensions of a ring; it was then 'ground down with sand and water till its outer edge [was] nearly circular and free of irregularities'. A bow drill was then used to make 'a series of 25</page><page sequence="8">closely adjoining holes . . . making a circle round the center of an inch or so in diameter. A piece of a wiry creeper is next taken, introduced into one or these holes . . . ' (Somerville 1897:364). Two holes could then be connected by sawing through one hole with the vine or creeper, made abrasive by being coated with damp sand, until an adjacent hole was reached. One man evidently could use this process but more oiten it involved two. Eventually sections 01 clam shell would drop away (Ribbe 1903:292-5; Schneider 1905:78-82; Finsch 1914:79-92, Taf. V, Abb. 133 161). Somerville, a navy lieutenant who observed this and other practices during his navy surveying term in Marovo in 1893-4, observed: 'The ring is now placed on a stick of hard wood or stone . . . and the centra] hole is gradually ground out larger and larger upon it, still with sand and water, until the ring has acquired the proper internal diameter. The com pleted rough article is then smoothed and polished with fine sand and pieces of bamboo until both inside and outside have the proper finish . . . ' (Somerville 1897:364-5). Observation of shell ring production on Choiseul Island led Guso Piko to hypothesize that this was the same production process used for clam shell openwork barava plaques, a process that he never directly observed (Piko 1976:101-2). termed bokolo. Hocart, in writing about bokolo on Simbo, described the ring as an armband of clam shell that was made in Roviana. The most valuable bokolo were made of fossilized clam shell (Hocart field diary, 1908:714; 1922:74). Certain bokolo from Simbo and Roviana bore images of paired birds or anthropomorphic figures (e.g. Solomon Islands Na tional Museum 74.176; Suva Museum Fiji 52). Large versions 01 dokoio mat approximate me size 01 Dar ava openwork plaques have been called 'custom money'. At what point in time the application of this term first occurred and in what place is not clear. Currently I am examining this issue in a paper that focuses on barava openwork plaques. Rings of various sizes had myriad ritual and non-ritual exchange uses. Hocart is a principal source for this information (field diary for 1922, 1931, 1935). Important also are works on shell rings by Russell (1972) and Miller (1978; 1979). Shell rings served to facilitate all sorts of exchanges among peo pie and between people and spirits in the Western Solomon Islands. Sheppard, Walter and Aswani de scribe the presence of'single rough rings called bareke ...considered at Roviana to be early forms as sociated with priests...unlike the rings used in ex change or as symbols of chiefly authority' (Sheppard, Walter andAswani 2004:127). Strings of shell rings were draped over skull huts and bound to skulls (e.g. tJritisn Museum isy4.188). Small rings have also been fastened to the arms of one wooden anthropo morphic figure seated atop a fish-net float, which re portedly comes from either Ranoneea. Telina or Ghizo Island in Western Province (South Sea Islands Museum, Cooranbong 2004.323; Howarth 2011: plate opposite p. 117). No documentation exists for this highly unusual object. A particularly valuable type of shell ring was Une example of a charm comprised of shell rings has particular relevance to this paper, with its focus on cluster or aggregates. This is the ragomo (raghomo), a type of charm allegedly originating on Santa Isabel Island but documented by Hocart on Simbo. Although the name includes 'rago', the name of the mollusk shell section featured on ligomo as well as serembule/vovoso, this charm with shell rings appears to have been a different type of object and did not include the rago shell, at least as described by Hocart. His example, observed on Simbo Island, con sisted of 'superimposed rings of decreasing diameter with a large ring at the base. They are tied together with asama. hour vertical rows ot small rings called pinuili were tied to the sides of the pile in a plane with two diameters of horizontal rings at right angles to one another'. The ringed charm was believed to nave puweiiui curauve emcacy. nocan s example, owned by Riambule on Simbo, allegedly could cure a man who had been speared in battle and could tell its owner to remove the spear from the victim. Food of terings were customarily presented to the ragomo which was addressed as though it was a spirit (Hocart field diary 1908:1201 ; the latter contains a sketch of this object). The ragomo, like the ligomo and the vovoso, was empowered through clusters or rings, a power reinforced through their material, and en hanced on the hgomo and vovoso by the presence of ather shell valuables. in) Barava Plaques (barava, mbarava, mbavara, -ano) Although each stick with shell valuables contains a slightly different assemblage of elements, most in clude triangular-shaped plaques termed barava. On 26</page><page sequence="9">Simbo and in Roviana, several varieties of barava were locally acknowledged. The term rano, used for the conical shells atop serembule/vovoso, can also be applied to barava (e.g. Solomon Islands National Mu seum 70.108; see also Fig. 11). Documented roles of these little plaques vary from neck ornaments (e.g. British Museum cat. 6367, 5368, 6369; Maidstone Museum, see Waite 1987:68, pi. 15) to 'grave orna ments' (Pitt Rivers Museum 1954.131; 1955.10-9). Julius Brenchlev obtained the neck ornaments in the British and Maidstone Museums in 1865 (see Waite ibid.). Others served as 'canoe ornaments' (British Museum 1915.30-310); the latter description accords well with the fact that sticks with attached barava were placed within the halves of a war canoe prow (Fig. 7). A single barava and shell ring could be lashed to each other to form a charm. One example in the Solomon Islands National Museum (72.160) was called 'serebule' (Fig. 13); it came from Rukururu village, North Vanguru, Marovo, and was alleged to be a 'magic charm used for asking for good weather, for burial sites, to prevent sickness and for good for tune for headhunting'. Ngini, an elder from Marovo, provided this information (Solomon Islands National Museum files 72.160). Hocart's field data from Simbo supports this museum data, since he recorded that serembule 'equals barava' (Hocart field diary, 1908:1205), thus suggesting their potential value as entities with power to ensure calm or well-being. Two triangular barava also could be lashed together. One of these charms in the Solomon Islands National Museum was termed ragakoro and came from Vella La Vella (94.104). Another, termed bar avara ( /4.1U9U), originated Irom saeaghana village, Marovo, New Georgia. It had belonged to Namura of Chea village, Marovo. According to museum records it was made of hio (clam shell) and had been 'nut in front of a shield when fighting'. Both shield and or nament were placed on the grave of the owner at his death (accession files, Solomon Islands National Mu seum 74.109). The meaning of triangular barava can now be surmised. Their identification with serembule pro vides one aspect oî tnis sigmiication. i neir contiation linguistically with the larger Tridacna openwork plaques expands that meaning, although there is no record as to when or where the term barava came to be used for both objects. Certain barava openwork ITTZX} KtjrjfJtA Fig. 4. Openwork barava plaque, Kia, Santa Isabel Island. Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge University, 22.999 H. 43 cm. Image Courtesy of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge. plaques display a row of miniature triangular barava images, usually on or near the top of the plaque (e.g. Vancouver CI 89; Kulturen Museum Basel Vb7730; see also Fig. 6). They may even replace the heads of anthropomorphic figures (British Museum 1907.74). The clam shell material shared by both types of bar ava plaques provides a common empowering link. The triangular shape of most barava plaques may also provide a clue as to their significance, though some are almost rectangular. The sides are straight or curved. One side of every plaque (usually the long edge of the triangle) is serrated or notched. Some have open areas near the apex with, at times, a row of small square holes just beneath the long edge which can consist of short parallel lobes, not just ser rations (e.g. Fig. 1). Could the triangular shape, with either straight or slightly curved sides and a single broad notched or lobed edge, allude to the shape ol 1. gigas (and/or other clam shell), given the incredible social agency of clams?

During fieldwork in 2005 1 dis cussed the possibility of associating the shape of bar ava and clam shells with Faletau Leve of Munda, Roviana. Leve said that he had never heard of this as sociation but acknowledged its potential validity (personal communication, September 19, 2005). This is not to say that a barava represents a clam shell, nor is it an attempt to propose a Micronesian connection; it is merely a hypothesis. The recurrence of triangular barava as im ages is another indication of their significatory role. They are a common motii carved in low relier along the vertical and horizontal bars of numerous canoe carvings, which feature large anthropomorphic im ages (Waite 1990:52 and Figs 9.15-17; see also Fig. 9). Considering the presence of shell barava on canoe prows, the barava motif on wooden canoe carvings only strengthens their association with canoes. The clam association and its empowering potential would seem to be the most likely explanation. Once again, it is worth noting that a triangular barava image retire sents (or references) a triangular barava plaque which could have belonged to important individuals and was worn on auspicious occasions, thus conveying multiple degrees of agency to the ornament. Apotropaic roles in different contexts and the poten tial significatory value of repeated representation cannot be ignored. (iv) Pangosia (pangosia, Marovo; panosia, Simbo; panqosia, Roviana) Pangosia are small oblong or roughly rectangular clam shell plaques averaging 17 centimeters in length (Fia. 14). Like barava openwork nlaaues. thev incor porate a single large ring at one end and, in at least one instance, two (Pitt Rivers 1954.8.130). A pan gosia photographed on a Kusaghe grave (interior of New Georgia island, as distinct from the coastal Ro viana region) by M. Tedder has no ring at all (Tedder 1978:80, Fig. 21). Three pangosia remain lashed to vovoso/serembule sticks in collections (British Mu seum 1904.6-21, 3, 4; Kulturen Museum, Basel Vb7478). Two others in museum collections are recorded to have formerly been part of one of these ensembles (Pitt Rivers 1954.8 129, 130). Unlike the triangular barava plaques, pangosia have a particular form of surface decoration. Each is perforated with a series of lines and dots arranged in groups; the arrangement is never exactly the same on any two. Only one (British Museum, Woodford Collection 1915.29) bears recognizable images; two schemati cally rendered anthropomorphic figures are seated back-to-back at the end of the plaque opposite the ring. The two little figures, composed in outline in a fashion in keeping with the other linear designs, cor respond to the pairs of seated figures that flank so many clusters of frontally rendered figures on barava openwork plaques. In 1904, Edge-Partington and Joyce demon strated in considerable detail the analogical relation ship between tne production process and imagery ot pangosia and barava openwork plaques. They also re marked upon the shared clam shell material. The pro duction technique common to the two types of plaques involved drilling points or holes into the shell and then connecting them by abrasion with a vine, a process of penetration (drilling) like that used in the production of shell rings and distinctly differ ent îrom carving. 1 he authors went to some length to illustrate in words and diagrams what they perceived as the evolution 01 simpler lines and dots on pangosia into the complex images on the openwork plaques. I hey drew especial attention to a perceived relation between the intervals separating images on the open work plaques and the pierced configurations on pan gosia. Their proposed evolutionary design-sequence was not inappropriate for that period of publication but there is no regional contextual evidence to sup port the thesis. The degree to which the markings had any sort of signification is difficult to determine. The 30</page><page sequence="13">small incisions and dots, which cover every pangosia, are not random but are clustered in groups, some of which are repeated on different pangosia. Coded ref erences in these dot-linear designs may or may not link them to certain barava openwork plaques. Hocart speaks of zigzag designs on one pangosia as referring to a kokombu tree carried on salt water and washed away. On it sit two mbelama (frigate birds; see below) that he also refers to as mbeku 'image' (Ho cart field diary 1908:1405). Zigzag lines are not ap parent on the Woodiord plaque with two figures, however (British Museum 1915.29). The pangosia photographed by Tedder lay on a grave. Tedder was told that it was termed not pan gosia but porombatuna. Here again, as with serem bule and its various applications, we have a terminological matter to consider. In the Roviana re gion of New Georgia Island, poro is the term for pan danus and, by extension, pandanus mats. Hingova had told Woodford that porombatuna was the name of an openwork barava plaque (Woodford 1905, no.20). Waterhouse defined porobatu as 'the top part of a serebule (1949:51). In 2005,1 asked Faletau Leve of Munda in the Roviana district about the usage of the term for an openwork plaque indicated in Woodford's article, and he strongly disputed it. Never, according to Leve, was the word porobatuna used for an object; rather it referred to a place where objects could be hidden so that they would not be sold or given away (personal communication, Sep tember 19, 2005). Communications obviously have varied through time and district; different peoples could have applied the term both to individual ob jects and the place for such objects. I suggest in the concluding section of this paper that the interrelation ship among these terminological applications is not without potential significance. Recorded data on the function and meaning of pangosia are sparse and derive largely from Ho cart. At one point, he defines pangosia simply as a 'shell ornament which seems to have varied in shape' (Hocart 1922:74). An image of a spirit called Rokoveo was apparently put in a canoe in order to 'cause the canoe to sway in divination' when that motion was desired during rituals. In a drawing made by Kunda on Simbo, Rokoveo wore 'an ornament called pangosia on his head' while he 'put on the rings that are thrown into the sea as offerings' (Ho cart 1935:105). A connection apparently existed between Rokoveo and frigate birds (mbelama or belcima) as well as a bird named elekai. Elekai were birds of prey associated with bonito fishing. They could be ob served diving for small fish swimming among the bonito, thus gaining significatory value as birds of prey. Hocart writes: Mbelama ramirubongi; it bird wind comes, it flies about; any mbelama he stops here (Hocart held diary, 1908:1405). He also men tions that mbelama meka was 'a frigate bird of storms because it flies about when a storm is pending (1922:293). The drawing showing Rokoveo with a pangosia on his head thus suggesting a linkage be tween pangosia and the birds of prey associated with bonito fishing. At another point, Hocart describes a drawing entitled 'Vambule' as representing a 'man full face who makes vambule; this man holds ovala panggosia of vambule...' (1908:1405). Inclusion of the word mbule references calm and peace; one can only con clude that the ritual had something to do with a guar antee of peace, just as was implied in serembule. The above information suggests an associa tion between pangosia and frigate birds as recognized signitiers ot storms, lhat association is conceptual, incorporated in myth, not visual; pangosia do not contain recognizable bird imagery as do other per sonal ornaments worn by men in Western Province. The warding off of storms and the resultant calm seas may envelop the pangosia with potential significatory value. The reference to vambule suggests the same sort of interpretation. However, an analogical rela tionship between fishing and war and, accordingly, bird of prey and warrior should not be forgotten (see above under Vovoso). The fact that pangosia were lashed to some, but by no means all, sticks decorated with shell valuables could have been deliberate de pending on the nature of the voyage — war or fishing. Of the four sticks with shell valuables obtained by Captain Davis, all were called serembule. One, how ever, prominently features a pangosia (British Mu seum Oc 1904.3; see Fig. 1). Did the presence of a pangosia indicate that this was indeed a serembule while the others were not, or was the ultimate pur pose of serembule and vovoso so similar that it made no difference? Information of this sort does not ap pear to exist for the relevant historical period 01 the objects. 31</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 13. Serubule. Ring and pendant.

Concluding Remarks: Expanding the Parameters of Process The intent of this final section is not just to bring to gether information already presented but to expand the context of the objects considered. Through a re view of literature and nomenclature that is often con fusing it becomes apparent that neither serembule/vovoso nor barava openwork plaques ex isted in isolation. Clusters of ornaments, or images of those ornaments, defined both serembule/vovoso and barava openwork plaques. Use of the same terms, e.g. serembule, serebule, mbule, barava, porobatuna, for different artifacts also suggests interactional or substitutional relationships among them. Material and process literally and metaphorically cemented the linkages and actualized pertinent connections with still other culturally relevant phenomena. 'Process' refers first to the creative process of drilling and abrasion utilized for shell rings and plaques. The insertion of a drill recalls another form of insertion termed va chopele: this term, meaning 'to insert', is given to the ritual use of sticks with shells at Marovo. Binding, a second process, included liter ally tne lasmng or omaing ox sneii oojects to sucks (termed piri on Marovo) and the representation of images of these objects on openwork plaques; in this instance, representation constitutes a metaphorical binding process. The repeated use of Tridacna clam shell as a material symbolically 'bound' openwork plaques to shell rings, smaller plaques and other ob jects such as adzes. Binding (or lashing) and insertion (or pene tration) were relevant production processes for other types of objects within the cultural context of the two types of shell objects under consideration: serem bule/vovoso and openwork plaques. The binding of fishhook parts and use of the term vovos for the bind ing material as well as for rings with shell sticks con stitutes one instance of both literal and metaphorical binding. The penetration of material through inser tion of a pointed implement produced openings that made lashing with fiber possible. For instance, poro, pandanus leaf mats used in umbrella-like fashion for protection irom the rain, were produced in this way (Waterhouse 1949:178). Hocart notes that the leaves are 'pierced at intervals with a bit of shell, and the bark of a kind of cane (arara) is threaded through two leaver ï&gt;u at&gt; lu bcw iiieiii lugciiici... ^nucau nciu diary 1908:1007). The term poro was incorporated into the word porobatuna, the term that was applied to at least one type of openwork plaque and one type of pangosia, but which also apparently could refer to a place where objects were concealed or sheltered from use in ordinary transactions. Canoes were constructed by lashing together or binding the individual planks through holes that penetrated the wood surfaces. Nielsen photographed two instances of this process utilized for a canoe in Marovo, one showing 'a canoe prow which has just been sewn on' (2005:17) and the other the interior of a canoe in which the individual planks are visible. These 'are sewn together and sealed with paste made trom putty [pannarium nutj (18). And, as already discussed, a stick to which triangular barava plaques were lashed was placed between the two halves of an upraised canoe prow, which were sewn together. It could easily be argued that drilling, sewing, and lashing were simply mechanical tech niques but the customary employment of these processes tor materials such as clam shell (rather than carving) would suggest a continuity of process that had metaphoric significance, though carving has replaced drilling and abrading for contemporary openwork plaques. The repeated use of the term vovoso for different forms of binding is indicative of 32</page><page sequence="15">the potential relevance of this sort of thinking. In Marovo, the use of the term piniri for objects with shell valuables, deriving as it does from piri, which implies the binding process, is another instance of metaphorical etymological association. The term barava is another instance of ex panded metaphorical implication. The word bara re ferred to a fence or wall on Simbo and Roviana (see note 1 ). Walls and fences are a form of marker that defines social spaces or places. So too did barava openwork plaques wherever they were placed — in or near skull huts or as land markers (Richards and Roga 2004); at Marovo, the va chopele ritual marked spirit sites. Fig. 14.

Repetition appears to have been the operative process that insured the effectiveness of the rings and ornaments on sticks and as images on openwork plaques. That repetition probably resulted from proven effectiveness of these objects during conse quential, sometimes precarious, situations. Strategic repetition — whether it be that of process, material, or the re-appearance of images — resides at the core of the affective process and constituted the cultural di alectic wherein they could make constant statements about social and /or spirit presence; in other words, serve as markers that bound people to their leaders, ancestors, and each other according to the wishes of selected group leaders. Despite regional, chronologi cal, and linguistic variations, both openwork plaques and sticks with valuables resonate all the more vi brantly through this network of signification, a process to be explored further in a second paper that will focus on openwork barava plaques.4 References Carlier.

Notes 1 The word barava applies to openwork shell plaques and the smaller triangular shell plaques. On Simbo and Ro viana, according to Waterhouse, bara meant 'a fence or wall, a fenced pen'. He notes that baraboko, literally 'pig fence' is also 'the name of a certain sign used in inlay work on canoes'. Other words that begin with bara include barabarata, adultery, and barakolo, a young bird or the plumage of a young bird (Waterhouse 1949:13; Lanyon Orgill 1959:3). 2 This paper grew from data accumulated over several years. Complexity defines the subject and, in equal meas ure, the research process. The data comes from museums, published articles, and unpublished archives. Of the latter, the field notebooks of anthropologist A.M. Hocart com piled on Simbo and Roviana in 1908 and now in the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, NZ proved to be a crucial source. The published articles by colonial offi cials Joyce, Edge-Partington, and Woodford provide a mixture of evolutionary analysis and field encounter; the colonial perspectives are evident but do not discount the data, at least not completely. Recorded oral history pres ents problems and its validity for archaeology has been se verely contested by certain scholars (cf. Mason quoted in, and responded to by, Sheppard et al. 2004:124). Criticisms notwithstanding, it is not without value, even given the conditions of data transmission. One of the values of mu seum research was correcting previously published infor mation (including my own; cf. Waite 1990:57, Fig. 5.26). In the British Museum photo of three serembule obtained by Davis (Fig. 1), the one on the far left is British Museum 1904.06-21.3, the central one is B.M. 1904.06-21.5 and the serembule at the far right is Auckland Museum 15185. Roger Neich had called this to my attention and his nota tion led to my going to the Auckland Museum (Fig. 2). A final acknowledgment: anthropologist Edvard Hviding impressed upon me the significance of process and mate rial, and of the customs and behaviour of Tridacna gigas clams. The ultimate presentation of this material is intri cate and leaves questions still unanswered. But such is the nature of dealing with an accumulation of historical mate rial. 3 C.M. Woodford, in his article 'The Canoes of the British Solomon Islands' (1909), frequently refers to the lashing of canoe parts but puts much more emphasis on the process of caulking the joined areas with parinarium nut. Nielson (2005) provides photographs that illustrate the lashing process. 4 Serembule/vovoso are being crafted today for sale and can be found in private collections, galleries and museums. One maker of serembule/vovoso in Honiara, Solomon Is lands, possesses a photocopy of the Edge-Partington and Joyce article that contains a photograph of three serembule obtained by Davis in 1901, now divided between the British Museum and Auckland Museum (Fig. 1). It is ironic that the serembule/vovoso 'captured' by Davis have become models for contemporary sticks with shell valu ables that bear varying degrees of resemblance to the origi nals. Valuables, deriving from what the Honiara maker referred to above called 'the western islands', vary in form and this has influenced the character of contemporary serembule. One collector in the United States was de lighted with the modern serembule artwork on her wall but was totally unaware that these objects originally decorated the prows of war canoes where sticks with shell valuables referenced deceased chiefs. The modern fabrication of openwork plaques has a longer history, and is even more common, than the replication of serembule/vovoso; many have found their way into gal leries outside the Solomon Islands. Some have been repre sented by their makers as old pieces. While in Honiara in 2005 I was shown several barava that I was told had been unearthed by a bulldozer near a village in 'the west' which had long been under missionary control. The plaques had, in fact, been carved in Honiara and, in some instances, soaked in tea to give the appearance of age. 35</page></plain_text>
