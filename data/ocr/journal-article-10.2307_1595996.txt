Lubaba (d. 314/926) and the traditionists Ahmad b. Khalid (d. 322/933) and Qasim b. Asbagh (d. 340/951). He also studied with the ascetic Sayyid Abihi b. al-'Asi al-Muradi al-Ishbili (d. 325/936), who is described by the sources as someone whose prayers were answered by God (mujab al-da wa). Maslama b. Qasim travelled to the East before 320/932, studying with many teachers in Qayrawan, Tripoli(4), Crete, Alexandria, Migr, al-Qulzum, Jedda, Mecca, Basra, Wasit, Ramla, Baghdad, Siraf, Mada'in, Yemen and Syria. Of these teachers the sources record the names of thirty-nine, most of them traditionists. Among them there were also mys- tics, like Abu Said b. al-A'rabi (Basra, Mecca, d. 341/952) (5), and Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Salim al-Tustari (Basra, d. 356/967) (6), a pupil of Sahl al-Tustari (d. 283/896). These two mystics also have in common that both refuted the doctrines of the Cordoban mystic and philosopher Ibn Masarra (d. 319/931) (7). Having collected much hadith, Maslama b. Qasim returned to al-Andalus at an unspecified date after the year 325/936, when he is known to have been in BaSra (8). He became blind shortly after his return to al-Andalus. As a teacher, he had many students, although his biogra- phies mention only one name, that of 'Abd al-Warith b. Sufyan b. Jabran (d. 395/1004) (9). No doubt a thorough search of the bio-bibliographical dictionaries would reveal more references to his pupils (10). I have found in this way references to two other students. One of them was 'Abd Allah, a son of the caliph 'Abd al-Rahman III, who was accused of conspiring against his father and beheaded in 339/951. This 'Abd Allah is described in the sources as an ascetic (zahid) inclined towards Shafi'ism and the (3) For a complete list of Maslama b. Qasim's teachers, see Appendix and the references given there. (4) In the biography of 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. al-A'mash al-Tarabulusi al-Muta'abbid al-'Azib (4th/10th century) mention is made of an "Abeo -Qasim al-Andalusi" who travelled in search of the awliya' and who had met al-Shibli (d. 334/945) in Baghdad: see al-Maliki, Riyad al-nufas, 3 vols., Beirut, 1401/1981, II, 159-161. The data given in al-'Azib's biography fit very well Maslama b. Qasim's life and interests. (5) See on this figure, who was influential in Andalus, M. Marin, "Abe Sa'id Ibn al-A'rabi et le developpement du ?sfisme dans al-Andalus", R.EE.MM. 63-4 (1992), pp. 28-38. Abo Sa'id b. al-A'rabi was both a mystic and a traditionist.

Ghayth al-Fihri al-Tulaytuli (323/935 or 328/939-405/1014), the transmitter of many works on asceticism (12). Maslama b. Qjasim is said to have written a Kitab al-nisa, lost but for one quotatian (13) which refers to an Andalusi ascetic woman who lived in the first half of the 4th/lO0th century. Maslama also wrote a rijal work, of which different titles are given: al-$ila li-l-Ta'rikh al-kabir li-l-Bukhari/ al-Dhayl 'ali Tabaqat al-mubaddithin/ al-Ta'rikh (14). To this work must have belonged the quotations from Maslama found in Ibn IHajar's Tahdib al-tahdhib, which indicate that it was a biographical work on traditionists (15). Ibn Hajar (16) is the only biographer who has further information about his works on hadith (lahu tasaniffti -fann), mention- ing, apart from the Ta'rikh, the following titles: al-Hilya and Ma rawa al-kibar 'an al-sigar, as well as a Kitab ft -khattfi 1-turab, on casting lots (darb al-qur'a). Maslama b. Qasim transmitted in al-Andalus a work on onirocritics (the Kitab 'ibarat al-ru'ya by one al-Kirmani, unidentified); a work on hadith (the Kitab al-marasil by Abu Dawod); a work praising the most important Andalusi representative of the ahl al-badith, Baqi b.

Waddab), and a work by the mystic Dhu l-Nion al-Misri (Su'al ba 'd al-zuhhad 'an sifat al-mu'min) (17). According to the data wa have reviewed so far, Maslama b. Q.asim would seem to be a standard Andalusi 'alim who devoted himself to the study of hadith, by then an established discipline in al-Andalus (18). But there are some unusual data in his biography. Ibn al-Faradi (the principal source on which the others are based) states that he had heard that Maslama was accused of kadhib, an accusation which, in the context of 'ilm al-badith, implied that Maslama was suspected of transmitting unre- liable Prophetic material (19). Ibn al-Faracdi, obviously worried, took advice with his teacher Mubammad b. Ahmad b. Yahya b. Mufarrij (d. 380/990)(20), who reassured him, saying that Maslama was not a kadhdhab, ony "mentally weak" (da 'if al-'aql). It is at this point that Ibn al-Fara1di adds that Maslama was "a man of charms and talismans" (sabib ruqan wa-niranjat), a description which I have not found applied to any other Andalusi scholar in the extant biographical dictionaries devoted to 'ulama'. I take this comment to be related, in Ibn al-Faradi's view, to the suspicions about Maslama's veracity. Apart from Ibn al-Faradi's biography, the most interesting one is that devoted to Maslama b. Qasim by Ibn Hajar in his Lisan al-mizan (21). (17) See on the first transmission Ibn Khayr, Fahrasa, p. 266. On the second ibid., p. 108 (he studied it in Basra).

QASIM AL-QURTUBI Ibn Hajar records, following al-Dhahabi (22), that Maslama was suspected of holding anthropomorphist views (tashbbh) and that he was not trust- worthy (thiqa) (23), but Ibn Hajar seems to believe that the accusation of anthropomorphism was made by those who were Maslama's enemies. Ibn Hajar describes Maslama as rajul kabir al-qadar (24). He also records an anecdote which has important implications, as we shall see. Maslama was visiting Jerusalem and fell asleep one night in the mosque, so that the gates of the mosque were closed while he was inside. He woke up during the night and saw a big lion which startled him. When he recovered from his fear, he fell asleep again. When he awoke, he asked an inter- preter of dreams (mu'abbir) about the lion and was told that it was Jibril and that as a result of his vision, he would become blind, so that he should return inmediately to his country. Maslama became blind in one eye al- ready during the journey by sea, and became completely blind in al- Andalus. Ibn Hajar adds that there was a group of people in al-Andalus who were biased against Maslama and who accused him of kadhib. He quotes Ibn al-Faradi (25) to say that Maslama b. Qasim had a doctrine of his own, as well as a secret and a book (kana Maslama abhib ra'y wa-sirr wa-kitab), and that it was proved that he held an evil doctrine on tashbihat (wa-hufiza 'alayhi kalam sa' ft l-tashbthat) (26). Modern scholarship has paid some attention to Maslama b. Qasim as a writer on 'ilm al-rijal (27) and in connection with the early development of sufism in al-Andalus. Thus, M. Asin Palacios decribed Maslama as a Cordoba and who used to attend the majlis of Ahmad b. Muhammad b. al-Jawhar (in the text : al-Jawr). (22) Al-Dhahabi seems not to know the date of death of Maslama and situates him in the times of al-Hakam II al-Mustansir, who ruled from 350/961 to 366/976. (23) Whereas al-Dhahabi in his Siyar states "wa-bufi.ga 'alayhi kalam st 'ft l-tashbth" in the Mizan he expresses some doubt ("qila kana min al-mushabbiha "). (24) I fail to understand the exact meaning of this expression. A tentative translation might be "a man who stressed predestination". Is this belief in predestination to be connected with his interest in astrology and magic ? (25) Ibn Hajar is using here either a version of Ibn al-Faradi's work different from that published or another of his biographical and historical works. See on Ibn al-Faradi's produc- tion, apart from the study mentioned in note 20 (above), M" L. Avila, "Obras biograficas en el Muqtabis de Ibn Hayyan", Al-Qjntara X (1989), pp. 470-2 and J.R. Castilla, "El Ta 'rj 'ulama' al-Andalus de Ibn al-Faradi en la obra del qadi 'Iyad", Estudios onomdstico-biogrdficos de el-Andalus. II, ed. M" L. Avila, Granada, 1989, pp. 265-276. (26) I understand this to mean a doctrine on those Qur'anic verses which could be inter- preted in an anthropomorphic sense. But perhaps tashbihat is a misreading for mutashabihat (I owe this suggestion to M. Cook), a technical term refering to those Qur'anic verses that are susceptible of different interpretations.

Makki referred to Maslama's role in in- troducing the work of Dho l-Non al-Misri in al-Andalus (29). Asin Palacios also briefly described Maslama as a "magician and charmer", and on his part, Makki refered to him as the "Cordoban alchemist" ("el alquimista cordobes") (30). In fact, Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi is an obvious candidate for the authorship of the Rutbat al-bakim, a work on alchemy, and the Ghayat al-bakim (= Picatrix), a work on magic, two works which have been at- tributed to the mathematician and astronomer Maslama al-Majriti. (This latter authorship was in due course dismissed, so that their author is usu- ally referred to as "Pseudo-Maslama"). In the following sections I will show why Maslama b. Qjasim al-Qurtubi has been hitherto ignored in the discussion about the authorship of the Rutba and Ghaya (section 2), after which I will make the case for his being the author of both works (section 3). I will then seek to place him in the context of batini trends in al-Andalus (section 4). In section 5 I will present some concluding remarks about the implications of the new iden- tification I am proposing. 2. The author of the Rutbat al-hakim and Ghayat al-bakim Dozy was one of the first to deal in detail with the attribution of the Rutba and Ghaya to the Andalusi Maslama al-Majriti (31). Dozy's results have influenced all subsequent discussion of the issue without being chal- lenged or revised. For Dozy, authors of works dealing with "forbidden sciences" (alchemy and magic) tended to hide their names by attributing those works to "des savants renommes et anciennes". It was sometimes (28) Abenmasarra y su escuela. Origenes de lafilosofia hispano-musulmana, Madrid, 1914, p. 23, note 3. See also M.

(30) Did Makki suspect that Maslama was the author of the Rutbat al-bakim ? If so, he has not written on this issue to my knowledge. (31) R.

The work was completed by de Goeje, as Dozy died before finishing it. In fact, Dozy's research on this issue was carried out in the last years of his life, when he was seriously ill.

QASIM AL-QURTUBI the copysts who made the false attributions. In the case of the Rutba and Ghaya, Ibn Khaldin mentioned as their author the mathematician Maslama al-Majriti (338/950-c. 398/1007) (32), an attribution which is also found in the manuscripts of both works (33). Now, no biography of Maslama al-MajrIti mentions him as the author of such works. Moreover, the manuscripts usually have as the time of the composition of the Rutba the dates of 339-342/950-953, and for the Ghaya the dates of 343/954-348/959. Maslama al-Majriti's life clearly does not fit into those dates (4). Therefore, Dozy concluded, he is to be rejected as the author of both works. Dozy added that the Rutba and Ghaya were in fact written in the first half of the 5th/11th century, according to information found in two manuscrits of the Rutba (35), where the dates of its composition appear as the years 439-442/1047-1050. These would be the authentic dates, corroborated by the fact that the real author did not live under the Umayyads, but during the fitna. The fitna is in fact mentioned in the introduction of the Rutba (lam tazal hadhihi 1-tariqa lazima li-ahl jaziratina... mundhu ghamarathum al-fitna...) as well as a period of persecution against those dealing with falsafa and hikma (36). Dozy ex- (32) See on him E12, V, 1105 (J. Vernet); GAS, VI, 226-27. (33) Since Dozy wrote his article new mss. of the Rutba and the Ghaya have been dis- covered: see on them M. Fierro, Historia de los Autores y Transmisores Andalusies (H.A. TA.), forthcoming, s.v. Maslama b. Qasim. They should be checked to confirm Dozy's statement. (34) Dozy mentions the fact that de Slane solved this problem by stating that Maslama al-Majriti died in 353/964, instead of at the end of the 4th/10th century. De Slane found the date 353/964 in M. Casiri, Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis (2 vols., Madrid, 1760-1770; repr. Osnabriick, 1972), I, 379. Dozy points out that Casiri, later in the same work (II, 147 b), gives 395/1004 as the date of death of al-Majriti, and he concludes that Casiri made a mistake here. But the mistake made by Casiri was not what Dozy thought it was. The date 353 H. is the date of death of Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi, as we have seen, and Casiri must have found it in one of the biographical or historical manuscripts of El Escorial library (I have been unable to locate it so far). Casiri's mistake was to consider that it referred to Maslama al-Maijrti, whose biography in Ibn Bashkuwal's Sila he had consulted and quoted. Dozy had Ibn Bashkuwal's work checked by F. Codera, who of course did not find in it the date 353H as the date of death of Maslama al-Majripi. Dozy then became convinced that Casiri had invented that date. On his part, when Codera published Ibn al-Faradi's Ta 'rikh in 1891-2 (from the unicum of Zaytona Library), he failed to see the connection between its biography no 1421 and Dozy's inquiry about al-Majriti's date of death. In this way, one hundred and ten years have passed without that connection being made. (35) Dozy used the following mss.: 1) Ms. of "Mus&amp;e asiatique de St. Petersburg", which corresponds to the ms. Inst. Or., Saint Petersburgh, no C 649 (see A. Khalidov, Arabskie ru- kopisi Instituta Vostokovedeniya, 2 vols., Moscow, 1986, I, 478, no 10124); 2) Ms. Paris, suppl. 1078. (36) See Dozy/De Goeje, "Nouveaux documents", p. 287. I have checked the same passage in the Ms. Begiraga, no 505, f. lb. I thank Prof. J. Sams6 and Dr. M. Forcada for letting me consult their copy of this ms. The passage on the fitna is found in the introduction of the Rutba, which is of interest in itself and should be edited and translated, as it is a telling document regarding some of the reactions against those interested in 'ulam al-awa il. 93</page><page sequence="8">MARIBEL FIERRO plains that in the terminology of Andalusi history al-fitna refers to the collapse of the Umayyad caliphate, and therefore the author of the Rutba and Ghaya must have lived at the end of the 4th/lO0th century and dur- ing the first half of the 5th/llth century. In the St. Petersburgh ms. of the Rutba it is added that the author died in 469/1076, in what Dozy considers to be "une note d'un ami ou d'un disciple de l'auteur, qu'un copiste a transport6e par erreur de la marge dans le texte". Dozy accepts the date 469/1076 as the date of the death of the author of the Rutba and Ghaya, but acknowledges his failure to discover the name of any Andalusi scholar whose life could fit with that date. Dozy adds in a footnote that there is a passage in the Rutba which contradicts the dates he is proposing. That passage praises Jabir b. Hayyan, and in this context the author of the Rutba comments that between Jabir and him one hundred and fifty years have passed. Jabir was active during the second half of the 2nd/8th century, so that if the year 180 is proposed as the date of his death and 150 years are added, the results is the year 330. But Dozy is not inclined to accept the statement made in the passage of the Rutba, and in fact dismisses it by saying that either its author made a mistake about the period in which Jabir lived or the number 150 is a mistake, and should be read instead as 250. Finally, Dozy adds that the author of the Rutba and Ghaya nowhere mentions his own name, and that he does so on purpose and out of fear, as he says "que de son temps les philosophes, que l'on consid6rait comme des incr6dules, couraient de grands risques, attendu qu'on les maltraitait, qu'on les jetait en prison et qu'on les mettait ia mort" (37). According to Dozy, the author of the Rutba also presents himself as the author of a collection of letters in a passage that would indicate that he "a voulu cacher son nom et sa residence". I will come back to this passage (which has been understood as refering to the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa ) in section 4. On his part, E.J. Holmyard (38) states that all the manuscripts of the Rutba and Ghaya agree in naming as their author Maslama al-Majriti (39). He repeats the arguments presented by Dozy (whose article he is using) to dismiss Maslama al-Majriti as the author of both works, adding a new argument: in the Rutba, mention is made of a collection of letters which for Holmyard are to be identified with the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa' but as these, according to FlUgel, were written about the year 360/971 (40), (37) These words refer to a passage in the Rutba: see ms. Begiraga, no 505, f. 2a. (38) "Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim", Isis 6 (1924), pp. 293-305; idem, Al- chemy, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 1957, pp. 100-2.

QASIM AL-QURTUBI one has to dismiss the dates 339/950-348/959 for the composition of the Rutba and Ghaya. Holmyard also follows Dozy in understanding the passage on thefitna as meaning "that he was led to write the book on account of the ignorance of his contemporaries and the lamentable state into which learning had fallen since the outbreak of fitna in Spain", in which he finds support for the dates 439/448-1047-1056 found in some mss. as the date of compo- sition of the Rutba and Ghaya. Contrary to this, there is the statement regarding Jabir b. Hayyan, which will bring us back again to the 4th/10th century. But according to Holmyard, the Jabir statement is to be dismissed, because it was un- doubtedly a mistake on the part of the author, who also mistook the dates of Ibn al-Wahshiyya, whom he thinks died before Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 148/765), whereas Ibn al-Wahshiyya died a century and a half after Ja'far (41). Holmyard is puzzled by the fact that the internal evidence "such as it is, all points to the earlier of the two dates [i.e. 339/950-348/9591 as the correct one, with the single but insurmountable exception of the definite statement that the former work was written after the fitna". In favour of the earlier dates there is also the fact (added by Holmyard) that no writer later than Abi Bakr al-Razi (who died in 311/923 or 320/932) (42) is mentioned, especially not Ibn Sina (370/980-428/1037), who should have been known to any author writing in the 5th/11th century (43). Another addition made by Holmyard is the fact that the earliest attribution of the authorship of the Rutba and Ghaya to Maslama al-Majriti is that of the alchemist Aidamar al-Jildaki (d. shortly after 762/1360) ("). The same identification is then found in Ibn Khalden (d. 784/1382) (45). Holmyard summarizes the situation as follows (46): I. Although the Rutba is invariably assigned to al-Majriti by al-Jildaki, Ibn Khaldan and later writers, the author does not name himself and therefore this ascription is open to doubt. (41) For the problematic identification and the dates of Ibn al-Wabshiyya see EI2 [T. Fahd]. In any case, there seems to be agreement that those dates are not later than the first half of the 4th/lO0th century. According to my identification of the author of the Rutba and the Ghaya, these two works were written between 339/950 and 348/959, and therefore Ibn Wahshiyya's works (whoever he is) must have been written before those dates. (42) Actually, Aba Bakr al-Razi, philosopher and alchemist, died in 313/925 or 323/935: see EI2 [P. Kraus and S. Pines]. (43) J. Sams6 has pointed to me that the influence of some Eastern authors reached al-Andalus quite late, so that the absence of any mention of Ibn Sina is not a strong argument. (44) See on him EI2 [G. Strohmaier]. (45) Hajji Khalifa (d. 1067/1657) gives the name of Maslama b. Ahmad b. 'Umar b. Wadda' al-Majriti: see Kashf al-zunian, ed. G. FlOgel, 4 vols, Leipzig, 1835-58, vol. III, 345, no 5871. (46) I have introduced some changes in Holmyard's wording. The references to the foot- notes are mine. 95</page><page sequence="10">MARIBEL FIERRO II. Al-Majriti died before the fitna and the Rutba was written after the fitna. It 'fitna" is to be taken in its usual sense [i.e., the one pointed out by Dozy], al-Majriti cannot be the author, as he died in or before 398/1007, while the fitna broke out in 400/1009. III. The Mss. of the Rutba give two different dates for its compilation : (a) 339-342 A.H. and (b) 439-442 A.H. If (b) is correct, al-Majriti obviously could not have written the work; (a) is incompatible with the statement made in II, viz. that the book was composed after the fitna had broken out. IV. The author of the Rutba claims to have lived more than 150 years after Jabir, who died about 800 A.D. as far as we can ascertain. This supports the date 339-342 A.H. (a above), but the author may have been mistaken as to the time at which Jabir flourished, as he certainly was mistaken about Ibn al-Wahshiyya (but cf. note 41). V. References to the Ikhwan al-Safa' may be later interpolations; they are in any case not in agreement with the dates 339-342 (but cf. note 41). VI. The only other point of internal evidence incompatible with the dates 339-342 is that mentioned in (II) above. The latest author men- tioned in the Rutba is Abo Bakr al-Razi (died 923 or 932, but cf. note 42). Holmyard concludes that he is inclined to accept the dates 439-443/1047-1056 as the correct ones and to dismiss the authorship of Maslama al-Majriti, the crucial point being the mention of thefitna. How- ever, he finds this solution not completely satisfactory, because several mss. give earlier dates and because there is no mention of Ibn Sina. On his part, W. Hartner points that the author of the Ghaya is so ig- norant of mathematics and astronomy that the mathematician Maslama al-Majriti cannot be the author (47). F. Sezgin has proposed the following solution: the Rutba and Ghaya were written by an "Aba Maslama MuIhammad al-Majriti" (48), whose name was confused with that of Abn l-Qasim Maslama al-Majriti, and by his pupil Muhammad b. Bishron (alive in 450/1058) (49). Ibn Khaldin in his Muqaddina preserves a letter directed by Ibn Bishron to one Ibn al-Samh (50), where the former summarizes the alchemical doctrine of the (47) W.

I have no clue as to where Sezgin took this name from. Was it from one of the mss. he has consulted ? If so, he does not make it explicit. (49) See GAS, IV, 298. Sezgin calls this scholar "Abi Bakr Mulhammad b. Bishran al- Majriti". I do not know where he has taken the nisba "al-Majriti" from. Ibn Khaldan calls him "al-Maghribi" instead. (50) See transl. F.

This Ibn al-Samh has been identified with the astronomer Abo 1-Qasim Aebagh b. Muhammad b. Aebagh b. al-Samh al-Gharnati al-Qurtubi (368/978-426/1035) (51), who is quoted several times by Ibn Khaldon and was a pupil of Maslama al-Majriti. On the basis of this iden- tification, the Rutba would have been written between 400/1009 (begin- ning of the fitna) and 426/1035, date of death of this Ibn al-Samh (52). The editor of the Ghaya, H. Ritter, is in favour of changing the dates 343-348/954-959, given by some mss., to those of 443-448/1052-1056, as found in other mss. (53). D. Pingree (54) and J. Sams6 (55) also agree with Dozy and Holmyard that the author of both works wrote them towards the middle of the fifth/eleventh century. 3. Identification of Abo 1-Q:sim Maslama b. Q.Asim al-Qurtubi (d. 353/964) as the author of the Rutba al-hakim and Ghayat al-hakim The hitherto ignored biography of Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi re- opens the discussion about the dates of the composition of the Rutba and Ghaya. Maslama b. Qasim's date of death (353/964) fits well with the dates 339-348/950-959 given in some mss. of the Rutba and Ghaya, and with the statement regarding Jabir b. Hayyan. We have seen that the scholars who have dealt with the period of composition have pointed out that there are no references to sources later than 400/1009, but in fact we can restrict those dates more. The latest authors mentioned are Dho l-Nan (d. 246/861), Abi Mash'ar (d. 272/886), Thabit b. Qurra (d. 288/901), Abo Bakr al-Razi (who died in 311/923 or 320/932), Abo Bishr Matta b. Yfnus (d. 328/940) and al-Farabi (d. 339/950) (56). The author of the Ghaya also mentions that he consulted a book by al-Hallaj (51) See on him E12, III, 953 (D. Pingree) and GAS, V, 356, VI, 249. (52) See infra, end of section 3. for another identification of Ibn al-Samh which fits with Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi as author of the Rutba. (53) Ed. H. Ritter, Das Ziel des Weisen, Leipzig, 1933.

No scholar quoted in the Rutba and Ghaya is therefore later than the dates 339-348/950-959 given in some mss. This reinforces such dates as the correct ones, whereas the dates 439-448/1047-1056 are to be seen as an attempt to reconcile the date of composition with the later perception of when the book had to have been written (58). Thus, the one important obstacle left to the identification of the author of the Rutba and Ghaya with a scholar living in the first half of the 4th/10th century like Maslama b. Qasim is the reference to the fitna. Now fitna does not necessarily refer to the period of the collapse of the Umayyad caliphate. The term fitna, contrary to what Dozy seemed to imply, is not restricted in Andalusi historiography to the period of the collapse of the Umayyad caliphate. In fact, the term fitna can be found in Andalusi chronicles to refer to outbreaks of political strife, like those which took place, for example, during the reign of the amir 'Abd Allah (275/888-300/912) (59). It was also used to refer to religious strife, such as, for example, the conflict between those in favour of and against the belief in the karamat al-awliya'that took place in the second half of the 4th/10th century (60). Is there any episode which could be described as fitna taking place during the lifetime of Maslama b. Qasim ? I have mentioned above that his pupil 'Abd Allah, the son of the caliph 'Abd al-Rabman III (r. 300/912-350/961), was executed in 339/951. One year later the per- secution of the Masarris started. The Masarris were accused of heresy (the terms used are bid'a, hawa, zaygh, dalala, ilbad and also fitna). Decrees of the caliph condemning Ibn Masarra's followers and seeking their repentance were read in the central mosque of Cordoba in 340/952, 345/956, and 346/957. In 350/961, the faqfh (later qadt) Ibn Yabqa granted the opportunity of repentance to some followers of Ibn Masarra, and had their books burnt. They seem to have belonged to the urban Masarris of Cordoba. None was executed according to the available data (61). Maslama b. Qasim was connected with the imprisoned and eventually beheaded Umayyad prince, who was his pupil. Another member of the (57) See transl. Ritter, p. 381 (= 390) and L.

QASIM AL-QURTUBI prince's entourage, and like him a Shafi'i, was also persecuted (62). More- over, we shall see that the persecution of the followers of Ibn Masarra (63) must have been aimed generally at those who were seen as deviating from Maliki doctrine and practice, which at that moment was given official status. Of course, if Maslama b. Qasim started writing the Rutba in 339/951, it could be objected that it does not make sense to start writing suspected books (64) precisely at a moment when a persecution of this sort was taking place; but as Dozy pointed out, it is the author himself who states that he is writing in a period when philosophers are being persecuted (65). Moreover, as I have suggested elsewhere (66), the decrees did not silence the Masarris. Around the year 350/961, the Masarris at- tacked the Maliki fuqaha', whose doctrines had been promoted as the orthodoxy of the Andalusi Umayyad caliphate. The Masarris accused the Malikis of having abandoned both a Qur'anic and a prophetic precept, and forced them to defend their doctrine in scholarly debate (67), which seems to indicate that they were still very active. A group of Masarris were active in Almeria at the beginning of the 5th/11th century (68). The evidence dealt with up to this point indicates Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (d. 353/964) as the obvious candidate for the authorship of the Rutba and Ghaya, and at the same time there is no substantive evi- dence against this identification (69). However, the objection can be made that the identification itself rests upon the assumption that the author of the Rutba and Ghaya must be someone whose nasab had the names "Abu 1-Qasim Maslama" in it (or at least the name of "Maslama"), which (62) This was thefaqth and historian Abu 'Abd al-Malik b. 'Abd al-Barr : see M" J. Viguera "La Historia de alfaquies y jueces de Ahmad b. 'Abd al-Barr", R.I.EEI. XXIII (1985-6), pp. 49-61. (63) See section 4 for a discussion of the question whether Maslama b. Qasim was a Ma- sarri. (64) Hartner showed surprise, asking: "How is it possible that, in a Muslim society which may be characterized by any epithet whatever except tolerant, a book can be composed and read which, apart from the Basmala heading the first page, contains nothing whatsoever that would seem acceptable to the faithful, nothing but sheer and pure pagan idolatry. And again, how is it possible that a no less intolerant Christian society... feels the need of having the same specimen of the most flourishing paganism translated into Latin ?" : art. cit., p. 418. In sections 4 and 5, I will deal with this issue. (65) Cf. the complaint of al-'Amirl (d. 381/992) about the limitations imposed on his work by the fitna of his own time in E.K.

If such names are dis- missed as a false identification or a forgery (70), the authorship of Maslama b. Qasim (d. 353/964) that I am proposing is consequently shaken (71), although it does not affect the point I have made that there is no reason for dating the Rutba and Ghaya later than their internal evidence and that the fitna argument advanced by Dozy is to be dismissed. The study of the extant manuscripts of the Rutba and Ghaya, which I have not undertaken, might help establish whether the attribution to Maslama al- Majriti started, as I assume to have been, because the author of both works was known to have been called "Abu -Qasim Maslama". In the meantime, it has to be stressed that the identification I am proposing rests on the assumption that that was the case, i.e., that Abuo -Qasim Maslama b. Ahmad b. Qasim al-Majriti (who died c. 398/1007) was falsely identified as the author of the Rutba and Ghaya because the mss. of the Rutba and Ghaya mentioned the name "Abu 1-Qasim Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi" (or something similar) and al-Majriti was the only other known Andalusi whose name was similar to "Maslama b. Qpsim" (72), and because in later perceptions it made sense to associate the authorship of the Rutba and Ghaya with a scholar dealing with 'ulhm al-awad'il such as Maslama al- Majriti. By the 8th/14th century, when al-Jildaki and Ibn Khaldin pres- ented al-Majriti as the author of the Rutba and Ghaya, Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi had become a shadowy figure whose memory was preserved only in tabaqat al-muhaddithin and was therefore unlikely to be asso- ciated with alchemy and magic. Ibn al-Faradi's comment on Maslama b. Qasim's "dark" side as a magician was brief and was not repeated by later authors. As we have seen, neither al-Dhahabi (d. 748/1348) nor Ibn Hajar (d. 852/1449) record any connection with magic, although both knew that Maslama b. Q:sim was not an unquestioned scholar. But there could be another objection, connected with the passage in Ibn Khaldon's Muqaddima where mention is made of one Ibn Bishran, a pupil of Maslama, who sent an epistle on alchemy to Ibn al-Samlh, an- other pupil of Maslama. As noted already, Ibn Khaldan identifies this "Maslama", the author of the Rutba and Ghaya, with Maslama al-Majriti, and consequently he identifies Ibn al-Samh with a well known pupil of (70) I have indicated above that for Dozy, authors of works dealing with "forbidden scien- ces" (alchemy and magic) tended to hide their names by attributing those works to "des savants renommes et anciennes", and that it was sometimes the copysts who made the false attribu- tions. (71) I wish to thank M. Cook for pointing this objection to me. (72) This point can be checked consulting the names of all the known Andalusi scholars active from the 2nd/8th century to the middle of the 5th/1lth century. Those names are collected in M. Marin, "N6mina de sabios de al-Andalus", Estudios onoma'stico-biogrdficos de al-Andalus. I, ed. M.

QASIM AL-QURTUBI al-Majriti who had that name and died in 426/1035. Now, the identifica- tion of the "Ibn al-Samh" to whom Ibn Bishron (73) addressed his letter with the astronomer Ibn al-Samh is based on the assumption that the Rutba was written in the 5th/11th century and that Ibn al-Samb's teacher called Maslama was al-Majriti. But if we start from the new identification proposed in this paper, then the author of the Rutba and Ghaya lived in the first half of the 4th/10th century, so that his pupil Ibn al-Samh must have lived during the 4th/10th century. I therefore identify the "Ibn al- Samb" to whom Ibn Bishrin addressed his letter with (74) Abo Sulayman 'Abd al-Salam b. al-Samh b. Nabil b. 'Abd Allah b. Yahyon b. Harith b. 'Abd Allah b. 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Hawwari al-Shafi'i (303/915-370/980 or 387/997). He travelled widely in the East, visiting Yemen. In Mecca he studied with Abo Sa'id b. al-A'rabi. This Ibn al-Samh is remembered as a pious and ascetic man, who devoted himself mainly to grammatical stud- ies. He settled in the caliphal town of Madinat al-Zahra', near Cordoba, where he died (75). Rosenthal pointed out that, according to information found in a ms. of the Rutba, "an estrangement had taken place between Ibn al-Samh and Maslamah" (76). The Andalusi Ibn al-Samh was a Shafi'i and the execution of 'Abd Allah, son of 'Abd al-Rahman III, involved also the persecution of other Shafi'is like him. If this Ibn al-Samh was also a pupil of Maslama, then he was also likely to be considered suspect during the persecution against the Masarris. Some of those persecuted accepted the opportunity of repentance given to them. Ibn al-Samh could have been one of them, therefore becoming part of the "establishment", which would explain the information given by his biographers that he spent the last part of his life in the caliphal capital of Madinat al-Zahra'. Repentance implied abandonment of his former teacher and this might be refected in the information about their "estrangement". If it is accepted that Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi is the author of the Rutba and Ghaya, this means that a series of works which have been (73) This Ibn Bishran has not been identified by previous scholars: see GAS, IV, 298. Given his nisba "al-Maghribi", I checked al-Maliki's Riyad al-nufils but to no avail. (74) There are other possible identifications with scholars called "Ibn al-Samh", such as Abi 'Uthman Said b. Salama b. 'Abbas b. al-Samb b. Walid b. Husayn (335/946-413/1022): see on him Avila, La sociedad hispanomusulmana, no 961. But their lives do not fit as well as that of 'Abd al-Salam b. al-Samh with the circumstances of Maslama b. Qasim's life. I am assuming that Ibn al-Samb was an Andalusi, but he could have been an Easterner pupil of Maslama. In the biography of Abo Bishr Matta b. Yonus in EI2 [G. Endress] I have found mention of one "Abo 'Ali b. al-Samh", teacher of Abo 1-Husayn al-Basri. The latter was alive in 395/1004 and therefore the dates of his teacher Ibn al-Samh would fit well with those of a pupil of Maslama. (75) See on him Avila, La sociedad hispanomusulmana, no 196 and Marin, "'Abo Said b. al-A'rabi", p. 33 and no 7. (76) Muqaddima, III, 194/230, note 969. The reference of the ms. is ms.

Qasim, as a traditionist, was un- likely to be associated by later scholars with alchemy and magic. How- ever, Ibn al-Faradi's information leaves no doubt that he was (85). Let us now examine more closely this apparently unusual combination of muhaddith and magician. 4. Maslama b.

Masarra (whose followers were persecuted by the caliph 'Abd al-Rahman III) and a "Maslama b. Qasim". On his part, Y. Friedmann mentions an unidentified "Maslama b. al-Qasim b. 'Abd Allah" who maintained that there was a considerable degree of affinity between the prophets and the muhaddathan ("people (77) See on them al-Baghdadi, Hadiyya, II, 432; Zirikli, VII, 224; Kabbala, XII, 234; GAS, IV, 298.

This is illustrated by 'Umar b. al-Khattab in the story of Sariya and in the lofty proofs which he expounded" (88). This quotation from "Maslama b. al-Qasim b. 'Abd Allah" (whom Friedmann does not identify) is recorded by an Andalusi author, al-Qurtubi (d. 671/1272), in his al-Jami'li-abkam al- rP'an. In a previous study, I already proposed to identify this "Maslama b. al-Qasim b. 'Abd Allah" with Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (89) (I have been unable to find any alternative identification). The "Maslama b. Qasim" mentioned in al-Qurtubi's quotation is con- cerned with the cessation of prophecy, and this fits with the similar con- cern shown by Maslama b. Qasim in the anecdote recorded by Ibn Hajar. His dream in Jerusalem, when Jibril appeared to him in the form of a lion and he became blind as a result, points to another way in which divine inspiration could reach the community after prophecy, namely, dreams (90). Maslama b. Qasim was not the first Andalusi concerned with the al- ternative ways in which God could speak to mankind. Before him, Ibn Masarra (d. 319/931) had claimed to be a prophet according to one of his opponents. Al-Talamanki (d. 429/1037), in his refutation of Ibn Masarra, known as al-Radd 'ala l-batiniyya, stated that Ibn Masarra idda'a 1- nubuwwa wa-za'ama annahu sami'a 1-kalam fa-thabata fi nafsihi annahu min 'indi Allah (91). Ibn Masarra's sources are still obscure.

Qasim" mentioned by Abo Bakr b. al-'Arabi, referring to Heterodoxia, pp. 129-130.

This accusation against Ibn Masarra was probably connected with his interpretation of the Qur'an. For the batinis, "ta 'wl, the educing of the batin from the zahir text, was... as fundamental as tanzil, the revelation of the literal sacred text itself, and was equally dependent upon divine inter- vention": see EI2, s.v. batiniyya [M.G.S. Hodgson]. 103</page><page sequence="18">MARIBEL FIERRO we know is that during his ribla to the East he read books and was taught sufi doctrines that were those of Dho l-Nin al-Misri (92) and Abi Ya'qib al-Nahrajori (93). Ibn Masarra's biographies fail to mention the influence of Sahl al-Tustari (d. 283/896) (94), which is clear in Ibn Masarra's extant works (95). Through the analysis of such works, Cl. Addas concludes that Ibn Masarra is first and foremost a sufi (as he was considered to have been by Muhlyi 1-din b. al-'Arabi) (96). On his part, E. Tornero thinks that Ibn Masarra appears more like a philosopher very much influenced by Neoplatonic doctrines, whose principal aims is to show the concordance between the Qur'an and philosophy. Thus, his Risalat al-i'tibar deals with how man can know God through the signs constitued by the created things. Ibn Masarra's Kitab al-bur4f, in which he deals with the letters found at the beginning of some Qur'anic siaras, does not aim at magical interpretation or the prediction of the future, but at showing that the Qur'an is nothing more than the explanation of creation. Man, therefore, can achieve prophecy, not so much through spiritual purification, but through the speculative process (97). Ibn Masarra was influenced by the mystics Sahl al-Tustari, Dhn l-Nan al-Misri and Abi Ya'qib al-Nahrajiri, and became a sufi philosopher who taught his doctrines to his followers in secret, and who was concerned with the cessation of prophecy (98). On his part, Maslama b. Qasim al- Qurtubi studied in Basra (99) with a pupil of Sahl al-Tustari, Ibn Salim al- Tustari. Maslama transmitted in al-Andalus a work of Dho l-Non al-Misri, (92) See on him EI2 [M. Smith]. He died in 246/861. (93) See on him al-Sha'rani, al-Tabaqat al-kubre?, 2 vols., Cairo, 1343/1925, I, 95; Asin Palacios, Abenmasarra, p. 154. His name is Ishaq b. Muhammad; he settled in Mecca where he died in 330/941. He was a pupil of Junayd (d. 279/910). (94) See on this sufi from Basra B6wering's study mentioned in note 6. (95) These two works were edited and studied by M.K.I.

Tornero, "Noticia sobre la publicaci6n de obras ineditas de Ibn Masarra", Al- Q.ntara XIV (1993), pp. 47-64, p. 61.

He was accused of making a peculiar interpretation of the Qur'an (tabrif al-ta wilfi kathir min al-Qurgan) and of upholding a kind of "conscience examination" (al-takallum 'ala tasbth al-a 'mal wa-muhasabat al-nufas 'ala haqiqat al-sidq): see Fierro, Heterodoxia, pp. 113-8.

Maslama b. Qasim could have met Ibn Masarra, as the former was born in 293/906 and Ibn Masarra died in 319/931, that is, when Maslama was twenty-five years old. If Ibn Masarra was not his teacher, Maslama must have been acquainted with his doctrines (101), at least indirectly, as three of his teachers refuted Ibn Masarra's works (102). Was Maslama b. Qasim a "Masarri" ? The problem in answering this question is that it is far from clear what exactly it meant to be a "Masarri". On the one hand, it is only recently that we have begun to grasp Ibn Masarra's doctrines on the basis on his own writings. On the other hand, the caliphal decrees against Ibn Masarra's followers show that under the label "Masarri" or "follower of Ibn Masarra" different doctrines were probably put together (03), the attack on "Masarrism" being partly the excuse for an Andalusi caliphal "mihna" which aimed at imposing religious uniformity in al-Andalus through the proclamation of Malikism as the official doctrine of the ca- liphate (104). What is clear is that Ibn Masarra was a batini, in the general sense of someone interested in the esoteric interpretation of the sacred texts. In (100) See on the connection between Dho l-Non, Sahl al-Tustari and philosophy B6we- ring, The mystical vision, pp. 52-5 ("Suhrawardi... assumes that certain Neoplatonic and Neo- pythagorean trends of Greek wisdom, as incorporated in the Hermetic literature, were handed on to the circles of the Sofi philosophers. He cites Du'n-Nun and, in dependence on him, Tustari and his associates as the mediating links who are responsible for the transmission of this wisdom tradition from the Hermetic environment to the Sofi milieu": p. 52). DhI l-Non and Sahl al-Tustari are also connected with the legacy of Jabir b. Hayyan: ibid., p. 53. See also on their "secret gnostic teaching" and on their dealings with "the secret sciences and the art of letter-magic", ibid., p. 54 (for B6wering, the evidence on this issue is "circumstancial" and not "substantive and historical"). (101) One of the alchemical sources quoted in the Rutba is Maria the Copt. Ibn Masarra reproduced in his house the room of Maria the Copt, concubine of the Prophet and mother of his son Ibrahim : see M.I. Fierro, "Una refutaci6n contra Ibn Masarra", Al-Qgntara X (1989), pp. 273-5. (102) That is, Abmad b. Khalid, Ibn Salim al-Tustari and Abo Sa'id b. al-A'rabi: see Ibn al-Faradi, no 1202. (103) See Fierro, Heterodoxia, pp. 132-40. The main accusations were: the Masarris be- lieved that the Qur'an was created, engaged in polemics about the signs of God (aktbara 1-jidal fti yat Allah), made a wrong interpretation of the Prophetic tradition (harrafa I- ta'awwul fti adthb rasal Allah), denied repentance (akdbaba 1-tawba) and intercession (abtalia -shafa 'a), insulted the pious first generations of Muslims (aqdama bi-makriab al-qawl fti -salaf al-salib), did not respond the salute of the Muslims (tarakfi radd al-salam 'ala 1-muslimin wa-hiya 1-tabiyya allati nasakhat tabiyyat al-jahiliyyin), were in favour of iso- lating themselves from the common people (qala bi-l-i'tizal 'an al-'amma) and of shedding the blood of the non-Masarris. (104) The batini elements in Ibn Masarra's doctrines must have appeared especially dan- gerous at a moment when the Umayyads were facing the threat of the Fatimid caliphate in North Africa. 105</page><page sequence="20">MARIBEL FIERRO Ibn Masarra's doctrine the four essential notions to be found in every batini system are present : batin, ta 'wil, kha$ wa- 'amm and taqiyya (105). And it seems to be batinism which Ibn Masarra and Maslama b. Qasim have in common. Batinism can be associated with sufism, philosophy and Isma'ilism, separately or together. In the case of Ibn Masarra, his doctrines appear as sufi and philosophical (106). Among Ibn Masarra's contemporaries, there were two Andalusis attracted by sufism and batinism ('ilm al-batin), both of whom were pupils of Abai Said b. al-A'rabi (d. 341/952) (107). The same combination appears in Maslama b. Qasim, and I have already mentioned that he also saw himself as a philosopher. As regards a possible connec- tion with Isma'llism, this implies looking at Maslama's relationship with the Ikhwan al-Safa. The Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa' are not mentioned by that title in the Rutba, but reference is made in several passages in the book to certain rasa'il by an unknown author, which deal among other things with al-'ulham al-riyadiyya wa-1-asrar al-falsafiyya. There is agreement among scholars that the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-$afa'are meant in those pas- sages of the Rutba. According to Y. Marquet, the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa' were written during a period between 297/909 and 354/965 (108). Pingree gives a much later date for the Rasa'il (end of the tenth century)(109). S. Diwald, on her part, relied on the information of the Ghaya to give as a terminus ante quem the dates of 343/954 and 348/960 (110). With the new identification I am proposing the terminus ante quem for their com- position would be 325/936, when Maslama is known to have been in Basra. In fact, Maslama b. Qasim must have come to know the Rasa'il during his stay in Basra, where he could have actually met the Ikhwan al-$afa', "a philosophical coterie... who attempted in their Rasa'il to com- bine Greek learning and Neoplatonic philosophy with Islam... (including (105) See EI2, s.v. batiniyya [M.G.S. Hodgson]. (106) The accusation made against some of his followers that they insulted al-salaf al-salih might hint at some Shi'i trends among them. Ibn Masarra's teachings included pro- phecies about future events, of which very little has been preserved : see a prediction concer- ning the Jews in F. Maillo, "The city of Lucena in Arab sources", Mediterranean Historical Review 8/2 (1993), pp. 149-165. (107) See Fierro, Heterodoxia, p. 130, and Marin, "Abo Said b. al-A'rabi", p. 33.

I have taken this information from A. Hamdani, "Abo Hayyan al-Tawbidi and the Brethren of Purity", IJMES 9 (1978), p. 350. Diwald does not seem to mention the date 339/950, the date when the composition of the Rutba began. 106</page><page sequence="21">BATINISM IN AL-ANDALUS. MASLAMA B. QASIM AL-QURTUBI large doses of numerology, Shi'ite imamology, and the occult)(111). Ac- cording to S.M. Stern (112), the Rasa 'il were adopted by the Isma'iliyya only a century or two after their publication, a view that has been challegend by A. Hamdani in two articles (113). On the basis on the avail- able data, I am reluctant to see Maslama b. Qasim as an Isma'li for his connection with the Ikhwan al-$afa' (114). According to a report found in Sa'id al-Tulaytuli's (d. 462/1069) Tabaqat al-umam (115), the first to introduce the Rasa'il into Spain was a pupil of Maslama al-Majriti's, Ab l1-Hakam al-Kirmani (d. 458/1066 or 468/1075) in the first half of the fifth/eleventh century. Sa'id adds that "we do not know anyone before him to have imported these writings into Spain" (116) (wa-la na'lam abadan adkhalaha qablahu). As Stern points out, Maslama al-Majriti himself has also been credited with the introduction of the Rasa'il (117). This ascription is connected with the at- tribution to al-Majriti of the authorship of the Rutba, where as we have seen the Rasa'il are cited. The authorship of the Rasa'il was even at- tributed to Maslama al-Majriti, together with the abridged version of the (111) Rowson, A Muslim philosopher, p. 22. (112) See his "The authorship of the epistles of the Ikhwan as-safa"', Islamic Culture XX (1946), pp. 367-72, and his "New information about the authors of the Epistles of the Sincere Brethren", Islamic Studies 4 (1964), pp. 405-28 (repr. in Studies in early Isma 'lism, Jerusa- lem/Leiden, 1983). The names of some of the Ikhwan active in Basra are given by Abo Hayyan al-Tawhidi (d. 414/1023) in his Imta' and Qali 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 415/1023) in his Tathbit dala il al-nubuwwa. They are Abo Sulayman Muhammad b. Ma'shar al-Busti al-Maqdisi, Q~adi Abo l-Hasan 'Ali b. Haron al-Zanjani, Zayd b. Rifa'a al-Katib, Abo Ahmad al-Nahrajori, al-'Awfi and Abo Muhammad b. Abi l-Baghl al-Katib. I considered the possibility that "Abo Ahmad al-Nahrajori" could be identical with Abo Ya'qub al-Nahrajori, Ibn Masarra's teacher, but could find no ground for it. Given the importance of the sufi teachings of Sahl al-Tustari in Basra it might be worthwhile to explore his relationship with the Ikhwan (but cf. note 101). (113) See the one quoted in note 111 an "An early Fatmid source on the time and au- thorship of the Rasa il Ihwan al-$afa"', Arabica XXVI (1979), pp. 62-75. A third article ex- ploring the relationship between al-Farabi and the Ikhwan (mentioned by Hamdani in "Abo Ijayyan al-Tawhidi", p. 353, note 46) does not seem to have been published. I owe these re- ferences to E. Rowson. (114) Stern, "New information" p. 169, states that "in the fifth/eleventh century the tea- ching of the Epistles exercised a considerable influence on philosophic and scientific circles unconnected with Isma'ilism", adding in a footnote : "It seems that this influence was particu- larly felt in Spain, where the Epistles were imported by al-Kirmani... and were used by various authors" (on the role played by al-Kirmani see below).

Gayangos stated that he had found his information in the Fa- brasa of the Andalusi Ibn Khayr (Stern's "Abo l-khayr" is incorrect). Stern rightly states that such information is not to be found there. However, according to Hamdani, "Abo Hayyan 107</page><page sequence="22">MARIBEL FIERRO Rasa'il known as Risalat al-jami'a (118). As I mentioned before (end of section 3), the works attributed to al-Majriti should now be considered as possible works of Maslama b. Qajsim al-Qurtubi. When discussing the authorship of al-Majriti, Holmyard took the view that the suggestion made by previous scholars that the author of the Rutba made "a new recension of the Letters has much to recommend it, and it would even seem poss- ible that he may have been the original author of the sections on animals, plants and minerals", although "this assumption has its difficulties" (119). From now onwards, this suggestion should be taken into consideration regarding Maslama b. Qasim. The quotation of the Rasa'il by Maslama b. Q~asim in his writings seems to imply that he introduced them into al-Andalus. Sa'id's ignorance of the role played by him before al-Kirmani would point to the fact that the original introduction of the Rasa'il took place in inauspicious circum- stances which led to secrecy and concealment. It does not seem far- fetched to think that among the books burnt during the anti-Masarri per- secutions were the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa. 5. Concluding remarks Both the internal evidence and the dates recorded in some manuscripts indicate that the Rutba and Ghaya were works written in the fourth/tenth century. Their dating in the fifth/eleventh century was mainly based on an interpretation of the reference to the fitna which has to be dismissed. An Andalusi whose dates fit well with the internal evidence provided by both the Rutba and Ghaya appears as the obvious candidate for their authorship, given his connection with magic and on the assumption that the author of the Rutba and Ghaya was known to have been called "Abo I-Qasim Maslama", which gave rise to the false identification with the mathematician Maslama al-Majriti. The identification of the author of the Rutba and Ghaya with Abo l-Qasim Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (d. 353/964) makes it possible to establish a terminus ante quem for the composition of the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa' (or one version of them) earlier than what has been hitherto assumed (120): a sure date is 339/950 al-Tawhidi", p. 351, note 32, Gayangos' source is Hajji Khalifa, who did mention that the Rasa 'il were written by al-Majriti (see his Kashf al-z.unan, ed. Fluegel, III, 460, no 6439). (118) See Stern, "New information", p. 174, note 43. See also above note 77. On the in- fluence this Risala had on the "Assasins", see Stern, "Authorship", p. 367. (119) Holmyard, "Maslama al-Majriti", pp. 295-6. (120) I do not think that this early date necessarily implies the rejection of al-Tawhidi's information (see note 112). It only adds a new element to be taken into consideration in the discussion of the authorship and chronology of the Ras 'il. 108</page><page sequence="23">BATINISM IN AL-ANDALUS. MASLAMA B. QASIM AL-QURTUBI (when some mss. of the Rutba state that the book started to be written), but it is also safe to conclude that they were written before 325/936, when we know that Maslama was in Basra. These termini ante quem also hold for Ibn Wahshiyya (121). The intellectual atmosphere of al-Andalus during the first half of the 4th/10th century appears to have been much more complex than it was thought until now. Both recent scholarship and the availability of new sources (like Ibn Masarra's works) have already shown that Andalusi in- tellectual life was richer and more sophisticated than the stereotypical image of al-Andalus as the land of rigid, conservatice, fanatical and intol- erant Malikism. Maslama b. Qasim's case sheds light on the process of reception in al-Andalus of batini and philosophical doctrines coming from the central lands of Islam. But it also shows that with him, as before with Ibn Masarra, the process of reception went together with a process of creation and of production of original thought. The years 339/950-350/961, that is the period from the execution of 'Abd Allah, the son of the caliph, to the last known episode of the per- secution against the Masarris, appear as crucial dates in the history of al-Andalus, as it was then that the first attempt was made to impose uniformity of doctrine on the Andalusis. The doctrine chosen by the Umayyad caliph was Malikism. Philosophy, batinism and sufism were con- sidered suspect (122), and from then on those dealing with those disciplines had either to resort to stricter secrecy or to look for a modus vivendi with. the new born orthodoxy. And even so, the Masarris are known to have continued their activities. Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi, moving in the fields of hadith,philos- ophy, mysticism and the occult sciences, stands as representative of the variety of ways of being a Muslim that existed in early Andalusi Islam. Maribel FIERRO (C.S.I.C. Madrid) (121) The dating (early fifth/eleventh century) of the Hermetic history proposed by M. Cook, "Pharaonic history in medieval Egypt", Studia Islamica 57 (1983), pp. 67-104, for which he partly relied on the Ghaya, should also be corrected (see especially pp. 81-2), al- though Cook himself indicates the possibility that it could have been known much earlier (see pp. 84, 87-9). M. Cook has shown that there is evidence connecting Hermetic writings with al-Andalus (pp. 98-9), evidence which would be worthwhile exploring. (122) Very recently, M. Acien has argued that the decoration of Madinat al-Zahra' could be interpreted through certain passages of the Ghaya : see his "Materiales e hip6tesis para una interpretaci6n del sal6n de 'Abd al-Rahman al-Nasir", in Madinat al-Zahra' El Sal6n de Abd al-Rabnman III, C6rdoba, 1995, pp. 179-195. Acien's argument seems to be that there was a conscious borrowing from the material of the Ghaya which would imply that the work was considered acceptable by the caliph and his entourage. The building of Madinat al-Zahra' started in the year 325/936, when Maslama b. Qajsim came back from the East. A striking coincidence (which might be worth pursuing) is that the name of the architect in charge was Maslama b. 'Abd Allah. 109</page><page sequence="24">MARIBEL FIERRO Appendix : teachers of Maslama b. Qasim (123) Al-Andalus 1) Muhammad b. 'Umar b. Lubaba (Marin, no 1283). 2) Abo .Haf? b.
