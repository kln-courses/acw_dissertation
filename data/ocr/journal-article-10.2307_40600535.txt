<plain_text><page sequence="1">September 11 The Burden of the Ephemeral Kay Turner ABSTRACT This article concentrates on the performativity of the ephemeral in a range of vernacu- lar responses to the events of September 11 in New York City by widening the frame for folkloristic interpretations of tradition and temporality. When random and sudden death interrupts the course of logic and prediction, memorial making acts to combine ephemer- ality with tradition in a gesture towards recovery through remembrance. KEYWORDS: 9/11, ephemeral, spontaneous memorials, temporal, tradition Vigil As the companion is dead, so we must all together die somewhat. Shed for him who lost his life, our tears are worth nothing. Love for him, within this grief, is a faint sigh lost in a vast forest. Faith in him, the lost companion - what but that is left? To die ourselves somewhat through him we see today quite dead.

Forty minutes later I returned to the window, gazed out again, and saw the Towers in smoke-billowing flame. Hit by hijacked commercial airlin- ers, the Towers collapsed within the next two hours and left nearly 3000 people dead. So much gone, so quickly, in the blink of my eyes. It was the beginning of a day that is not yet over.1 Certainly the temporally traumatizing events of September 1 1 and their aftermath of dust, fragments, traces, and ghosts engaged all of us in a heightened sense of the ephemeral. For me, as a folklorist and as a New Yorker, such engagement has continued to preoccupy me both intellectually and emotionally for the past eight years.2 Perhaps this is the condition of my firsthand experience of September 1 1 . I can't say. Outside the provocations of September 11, I would admit, as a point of rhetoric, the oddity of a folklorist's interest in the ephemeral. Folklore's concern is with what stays, not with what goes; with what remains, not disappears; with what repeats, not with the singular instance. We lean to the traditional, not the ephemeral. Years ago I would have thought the ephemeral a mere taunt. This binary is no doubt overstated. Perhaps without naming them as such, many of our colleagues have investigated ephemeralities, and others, especially those working in material culture, museum studies, and print lore address the ephemeral nature of certain things. We are most familiar with the term ephemera as it describes expendable paper works such as broadsides, holy cards, pamphlets, and photocopies. Folklorists including Don Yoder, Alan Dundes, and Cathy Preston offer insights into ephemera. Others such as Suzanne Seriff and Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett approach the ephemeral in their work on folk art and recycling and tourist art and collections, respectively.3 Seriff 's unpublished work on theoretical understandings of the Mexican Days of the Dead and the traditions of festival-related toymakers around the world is specifically about the power of the ephemeral to effect tempo- ral transgressions creating access between the living and the dead; the ancestors and the children; the sacred and the profane. Deborah Kapchan's study of women's henna practices in Morocco also exemplifies previous folklore scholarship that limns ephemeral- ity. Whereas Moroccan women are permanently tattooed for purposes of adornment or prophylaxis, impermanent henna paintings on the</page><page sequence="3">September 11 157 skin's surface are used to mark status change and transition, most importantly from unmarried to married. But Kapchan does more here than just note the permanence/ephemeral binary between tattoo and henna. She works to unlock the meaning of ephemeral processes, referring to henna as a plastic art, notable for its malleability, its ability to perform change: "...its very transience lends it much of its potency. As it must always be reapplied, henna art has the potential to express a multiplicity of meanings and forms, one of which is the renewal of the feminine community itself" (1993:5). Further, Kapchan suggests that henna's "ephemeral and révisable nature make it a more able car- rier of multiple symbols than the indelible tattoo" (1993:6). Seriffand Kapchan attest the potential for a rich folkloristics on the workings of the ephemeral. Much of my own work over the past twenty-five years concerns the possibilities of this discourse as it occurs in the very old and widespread practice of women's home altars.4 Studying the Mexican American version of the practice in the 1980s, I focused primarily on the altar's traditional side: its history, maternal legacy, and aesthetic conventions. But I was also interested in its maker's individually cre- ative engagement with her legacy: her assemblage of disparate images and ephemeral items - votive candles, family pictures, saints' statues, flowers, personal mementoes - into a dynamic, tactile threshold. A personally owned place, the altar not only represents its maker's desire for relationship with the divine, but also serves as an instrument for that desire, a place of momentary performances, where prayers and petitions are spoken and responded to by her divine intercessors. Such dynamism is propelled by the application of ephemeral resources: candles, flowers, photos, glitter, lights, daily gestures such as light- ing votives, sprinkling holy water, counting the Rosary, praying, and conversing with beloved saints. Women's home altar traditions are exemplary of the intersection between ephemeral linguistic, gestural, and material means for ritually receiving human benefit from divine resources. Ritual quickly expends and repetitively uses its resources and is in effect a highly refined application of ephemeral performa- tives for achieving relationship with unseen powers, of accessing the eternal via the ephemeral. Domestic altars of the south Texas kind share in a broader folk Catholic topos of yard shrines, pilgrimage shrines and grottoes, graves, and roadside memorials - all artfully expressive human-made markers indicating the intersection of temporal and eternal interests. Mexican</page><page sequence="4">158 KAY TURNER folk practice exemplifies in particular the way sites of contact with the deceased - altars, gravesites, and memorials - mark the attempt to retain relationship to, and memory of the dead. Not surprisingly, these are also places of profound engagement with ephemerality. The Mexican grave confronts the living with the fleeting materiality of the body - with remains: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. But just as well, the grave provides the opportunity to battle death's finality with material signs and ritual gestures: markers, stones, flowers, Days of the Dead and other holiday celebrations, symbols, messages, regular visits, and prayers.5 Folklore studies are, of course, generally concerned with time and its effects on the cultural construction of memory as well as with age-old techniques for retaining and preserving that which time takes away. In an overarching sense, folklore's agenda - both the social practice and the discipline - centers in temporal matters. Though rarely voiced directly in our literature, yet felt in the anxiety that governs much of what we study, temporality is the mother of tradition. A core question of our discipline, simply put, is "How do we as humans address time's passing and what remains or disappears as it recedes and endlessly passes, as it makes futures possible and then again recedes?" As I have already suggested, folklorists tend to stand by tradition, its reasonable and for the most part reassuring structures of continuity, imitation, repetition, and absorption. But more than we perhaps are aware, or call it out as such, the ephemeral is also necessarily within our purview because the folklorist's answer to this question takes into account the passage from life to death, including its sometimes tragic and unthink- able suddenness. It is in this crucial transitory passage that the folklore of the ephemeral stands out for our disciplinary regard.6 Concern with the ephemeral is concern with the transitory, the transitional, the short-lived or fleeting, with that which, by definition, begins and ends in a single day.7 Ephemerality humanizes time by referring us to the exigencies of our mortality. Defined by the present, it only exists in the present moment and its performative tense, even if it makes reference to the past or to the future, is a performative pres- ent. With reference to this over-determined present tense, ephemeral- ity defines the vernacular workings of the phenomenological; it refers us to the fleeting moments in which sociality is actually occurring in experience and performance. Tradition saves us from the complete loss of these moments. As a temporal strategy, tradition helps us store our experiences in time (and our experience of time) in individual and communal memory</page><page sequence="5">September 11 159 recorded and repeated in expressive forms. The ephemeral does not retain, but it does expend and perform. It activates sedimentation pro- cesses that link to tradition. For example, processes of remembrance that enable memory. Performance and performativity are crucial to both the traditional and the ephemeral. What we know as folklorists is the performativity of tradition; what we need to know more about is the performativity of the ephemeral. In a different context Performance Studies scholar José Munoz suggests that "ephemera" is a useful concept for "reformulating" and expanding our sense of the materiality of memory: Ephemera... is linked to alternative modes of textuality and narrativity like memory and performance: it is all of those things that remain after a performance, a kind of evidence of what has transpired but certainly not the thing itself. It does not rest on epistemological foundations but is instead interested in following traces, glimmers, residues, and specks of things. (1996:1 0)8 Further, Munoz says that the ephemeral is always about culture's particularities and "resisting dominant systems of aesthetic and institu- tional classification.... Ephemera... is firmly anchored within the social. Ephemera includes traces of lived experience and performances of lived experience, maintaining experiential politics and urgencies long after these Structures of feeling' have been lived" (1996: 10-1 1).9 Traces of the ephemeral are also embedded in the "lived experi- ence" of tradition. The traditional and the ephemeral speak to each other importantly and folklorists, especially in the 21st century, are called upon as much to study "the blink of an eye" as "once upon a time," and perhaps even more crucially to interpret their dialogic rela- tions. This article concentrates foremost on the performativity of the ephemeral in a range of vernacular, primarily material and gestural, responses to the events of September 1 1 in New York City, but it also attempts to widen the frame for folkloristic interpretations of tradition and temporality. EPHEMERAL MEMORIALS All of the above-mentioned traditions - altars, gravesites, and so on - are historically old and deeply rooted in codified familial and community practices based for the most part in institutional religious affiliation. Their ultimate appeal is in gaining assurance of the rela- tionship between the human (alive or deceased) and the divine, but</page><page sequence="6">160 KAY TURNER they also serve as places where the living may remain symbolically or spiritually in contact with their dead.10 Related to these, but significantly different, a new manifestation of memorial traditions has emerged in the past three decades in the United States and elsewhere. In the wake of tragedies both great and small, national and local, we have seen the rise of what Jack Santino names "spontaneous shrines," what The New York Times and other media refer to as "makeshift memorials," and what I generally call "ephemeral memorials." I use Santino's "spontaneous shrines" inter- changeably with "spontaneous memorials" to refer specifically to those that arise in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. They are a special case of the "ephemeral memorial," which also includes, for exam- ple, the premeditated constructions seen at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. My use of "ephemeral memorials" is consonant with Santino's "performative commemoratives," especially insofar as I also emphasize, and will elaborate here, the dynamic rela- tion between ephemerality and performativity in memorials, as well as in other expressive arts emergent from September II.11 Made anonymously and reutilizing what once were the primarily private, formalized means of remembering our personally known dead, these new memorials create secular sites of public mourning. They are vehicles for immediate response to tragic circumstances and the loss of individuals, many of whom the memorial makers never personally knew. In the sense first identified by D.W. Winnicott ([1951] 2005) ephemeral memorials are "transitional objects": they exist to allow the transit from grief to mourning, from incomprehensibil- ity to some version of understanding. Testifying to the widespread emergence of this memorial phenomenon, Santino's edited collec- tion Spontaneous Shrines and the Public Memorialization of Death (2006) provides a range of interpretive approaches to what he suggests constitutes a new "genre of mourning ritual" (2006:2). Santino (and many of his authors) consider the genre's performativity. Santino maintains that in different contexts the shrines share "a component of addressing a social issue, of trying to convince people, of trying to make something happen" (2006:1). Theatre scholar Alice Rayner also defines spontaneous shrines in relation to performativity calling them "performative gestures of grief" (2006:67).12 Grief, like the spontaneous memorial, is meant to be brief. In what is conventionally understood as the healthy course of things, grief should soon turn into its more civilized counterpart, mourning.</page><page sequence="7">September 11 161 Mourning rituals are formal performances of accepting death, but grief's performance is without formality, without acceptance: grief is a cry, a wail, a howl, a flowing of tears. Grief is in and of the body. The fragility and fleetingness, the individual expressiveness - even the messiness - of the human body is matched by those memorials which quickly rise in its tragic absence. Because they perform grief in mate- rial expressions and physical gestures, they are, in a sense, ephemeral analogs of bodies; they are symbolically composed of the ashes of the dead and the tears of the living. Ours and other disciplines rely heavily on J. L. Austin's ([1962] 1975) concept of performativity as "doing things with words" (emphasis added). Santino, in his notion of performative commemoratives extends the terms "from utterances to events" (2006:9) and I hope to show here that overemphasizing the verbal command comes at the expense of ignoring non-verbal - mate- rial and gestural - modes of the imperative.13 Attention paid to the animations of the ephemeral works to balance our understanding. Remembrance is a performance of memory. Immediately after the crisis of death, ephemeral memorials promote the task of remem- brance. They provide the first objects of eventual memory, and even though their performance fades with time, then disappears, they ini- tiate a way to look back across the gap between the present and the past. Fabricated out of ephemeral materials and ready-mades, these new memorials bear some of the material and symbolic features of personal religious altars - candles, flowers, images, mementoes - but their impulse is wholly secular: they are foremost about solidarity and connection with other humans, not with the divine. They are about comfort and longing; often enough their central "icon" is the teddy bear, and their central image is a photograph of the deceased. They are about immediacy, not longevity. They fill the gap that opens in the difficult conversion of grief to mourning. This gap imposes a sense of liminal emptiness, of estrangement from time's flow from past to pres- ent to future. Such estrangement is unspeakably hard to bear and so these memorials are about "right now," the present, and present need. Where once a period of appropriate visual abstinence and respect- ful public silence was observed before the private funeral was held, or before the public monument was raised years later, ephemeral memo- rials speak of a collective unwillingness to wait for formal ceremony or monumental edifice. They visibly announce a populist desire for emotionally engaged and immediate public performance of grief and loss. In purely temporal terms, though, they also stake a claim on the</page><page sequence="8">162 KAY TURNER future. When random and sudden death interrupts the course of logic and prediction; when a break has occurred with the reality we believe is ordained, or at least expected, memorial making acts to combine ephemerality with tradition in a gesture towards recovery through remembrance, through attachment to the past in hope of a future. As I discuss further in the second half of this essay, and as many of the authors in Santino's collection demonstrate as well, the evolution of spontaneous shrines and ephemeral memorials can be traced over the past 30 years or more. But I would dare say the phenomenon reached a performative pinnacle in the overwhelming magnitude of September 1 1 memorials that began appearing across the city and else- where within 48 hours following the attacks. A mass contagion of grief resulted in hundreds of spontaneous shrines at neighborhood fire- houses and police stations; at Union Square, Washington Square Park, Lincoln Center Plaza, Columbus Circle, and Grand Central Station; on the Brooklyn Promenade, with its once-stunning views of the Towers across the East River; on house stoops and street corners throughout the city; at the Pentagon in Washington, DC; in the fallow field at Shanksville, PA; across the entire country; and around the world. SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND THE DAYS AFTER Caught unaware, thousands of us saw the destruction with our own eyes. Our first gestures of solidarity were responses to the indi- vidual trauma each had suffered: the stunned helplessness of being an onlooker, a survivor in the face of cataclysm, suspended between then and now.14 Out of sorrow, out of a need I could hardly articulate, I, like so many others, was drawn to Union Square numerous times in the first days after the attacks. For nearly a week, below- 14th Street access to downtown was barricaded.15 Fourteenth Street at the Square's southern border became a threshold separating the living from the dead (Harlow and Zeitlin 2001). Union Square became the commu- nal counterpoint to Ground Zero, "the frozen zone," where sudden annihilation had transformed the seemingly permanent into the definitively ephemeral: buildings became dust; work became millions of tiny scraps of paper floating in the air; and people, a total of 2603 of them, became bits and pieces of body parts, traces of DNA, or disap- peared altogether, incinerated. Lower Manhattan was uninhabitable and Ground Zero, designated a crime scene, became a lonely, smol- dering grave, closed off, inaccessible except to rescue workers who</page><page sequence="9">September 11 163 valiantly labored to retrieve remains. For days, our sole visual record of the place where the Towers had stood was a giant billowing smoke plume endlessly generating its menace, floating ghostlike - and bear- ing ghosts - across the city. These harrowing ephemeralities of dust, bone, and smoke - ephem- eralities of disaster and death - were in stark contrast to a different version of the ephemeral that then prevailed at Union Square. If, as Camille Paglia and Ingrid Sischy (2001:88) suggest, in an instant two of the primary symbols of 20th century modernity - the airplane and the skyscraper - were used as weapons against each other, our first response to that catastrophic collision was a return to the usefulness of ephemeral, and hence incorruptible, symbols. The fragile begin- nings of recovery from annihilation - an experience of stopped time, a feeling of the end of time - was initially felt in the human impulse to store time and memory in mundane material objects and simple yet universal symbolic images that could be seen, experienced, and interpreted by all. Most immediately, the status of World Trade Center souvenirs shifted to Twin Towers memorabilia. Greta Galuszka writes: This first round of ephemera - simply any and - all (pre-September 11th) things "Twin Towers," quickly acquired, in a space of hours, an altered significance through trauma. [These ephemera] functioned primarily in a straightforward way as witness ... by focusing a desire to "claim" a September 10-based knowledge and experience of the Towers on a pre-existing model of their existence in [representational] forms produced before they fell. . . . [T]he most immediate post- 9/ 11 ephemera represented an attempt to "fix" the Towers, to prevent the collapse which had already happened. (2002: 1-4)16 By the time I arrived at Union Square on September 12th, the postcard racks at local stores along Broadway were empty of Trade Center images. In the days following the tragedy, the burden of the ephemeral was particularly acute. Fragile assemblages of candles, photos, flow- ers, and messages - many of them incorporating images of the Twin Towers - were called upon to. speak for those - both the dead and the living - who were muted by the disaster. For New Yorkers the burden of the ephemeral and the triumph of the particular were never so sharply felt as in those days. The ephemeral was summoned to fill the gaping void that had opened up between the living and the dead and</page><page sequence="10">164 KAY TURNER between the past and present, in the face of incomprehensible loss of life, of place, of meaning. Within hours of the buildings' collapse, evidence of ephemeral acts and gestures began to assert a claim on the experience: photographs of the missing were posted everywhere, images of the Towers were drawn in the gray-white ash, candles were lighted, and soon sponta- neous shrines began to fill the space of absence and incomprehensi- bility. With color and collage, they filled the void with something to see, to smell, to touch, to say. Ground Zero burned with the stench of annihilation; two miles north Union Square burned with thousands of candles and reeked also, but of flowers, incense, and melting wax. By the evening of September 1 lth, the Square began to fill with sor- rowing New Yorkers, their grief inscribed in the ephemeral "record" they started to create within hours of the Towers' destruction. In addi- tion to the pleading "have you seen" posters, pieces of butcher paper set out in the south end of the Square by New York University student Jordan Schuster were scrawled with despairing messages and crude drawings of the Towers, peace symbols, and planes (Zeitlin 2006:101). Then came the first few flowers, candles, messages. These loose assem- blages were not memorials per se; they were signs of witness, gather- ings of transitional symbols filling the space of meaning that had been so suddenly, terribly emptied; holding a place, too, for those who were missing, not yet known to be still alive or now dead. This was the time of the missing - the missing people, the missing buildings, the missing president, the missing country, the missing sense of connection to the "real," the normal, the everyday. The fragility and expendability of life itself weighed heavily, exposing the negative burden of the ephemeral. Within the next twenty-four hours the sense of eerie suspension increased to a full-blown liminality punctuated by grief, confusion and an overwhelming sense of status change: that things would never again be the same. A call to the first vigil spread by word-of-mouth and on the evening of September 12th, hundreds filled the Square, moving silently or crying, holding hands of loved ones and strangers alike, cupping candles, murmuring disbelief or offering silent prayers, and then placing the candles on the walkways, along fence lines, and in front of the Square's famous statues of George Washington and Ghandi. Those first lights would be followed in the days to come by thousands more. That evening the first function of the communal impulse was existential: "I am still alive. I saw others die. But I am still alive. Why? Why did this happen? Where are the missing? Will they be</page><page sequence="11">September 11 165 found? Or are they dead? I can still see, taste, hear, touch, feel. Why? Why didn't I die?" Such raw questioning, such mute, unanswerable despair was enfolded by candlelight, tears, and touch: our ephemeral indices of survival. The evening of the vigil and the next day, Thursday, saw the great- est outpouring of ephemeral transitional markers: candles, flowers, reutilized tourist postcards of the Towers, and scribbled messages. But the greatest sense of the transitory wedded to the ephemeral was seen in the hundreds of handmade "missing" posters, which tried to capture in one smiling photo and a few descriptive lines the possibility of finding what was wholly lost: the absent body, the missing person. Looking at the smiling photos of Trade Center employees and rescue workers posed in the normal course of their pre-September 11th lives - at a wedding, at a party, at the beach - was unforgettably sad. Strangers openly sobbed in front of pictures of strangers. We were all looking at what Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett calls the "Kodak moments in the lives of the missing and presumed dead." She adds: In the absence of a body, a photograph became the only tangible address to which mourners could bring their prayers . . . photographs were virtually useless for identifying missing persons . . . photographs became "paper monuments in the stone cemetery of the city" (Kuzub 2001, quoted in Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 2003) . . . they became votive objects. But, unlike a tombstone that marks a singular grave, these paper monuments, photocopied on standard 8.5 χ 11 inch sheets, multiplied the spectral presence of the missing. They were now literally in more than one place at a time, but nowhere to be found. (2003:19) Gazing at these "Kodak moments" became an act of grieving in this time of agonizing physical dissonance and great confusion.17 Rumor and speculation flew in the streets. But soon enough the impact of certain death was felt. The liminal torture between absence and death, the space of not knowing, gave way to the irremediable recognition that most of the missing were gone forever. As Amy Waldman ret- rospectively reported on September 29, 2001, in The New York Times, those missing posters, "Manufactured in hope, [had] now transformed into memorials." By Thursday afternoon, September 13th , the grieving had fully begun in an eruption of memorials composed of photos, candles, flow- ers, pictures, postcards, posters, t-shirts, teddy bears, flags, drawings, sayings, poems, and slogans. Many were by now dedicated to named</page><page sequence="12">166 KAY TURNER dead and bore the unique personal evidence of lost lives: boots, hats, a guitar, a favorite shirt, messages and poems in direct address.18 Alongside these were memorials addressing the death of the Towers themselves. An anthropomorphic urgency was felt in seeing the cen- tral placement of flower-wrapped WTC souvenir postcards scribbled with "I miss you"; in drawings of the two buildings with faces, crying, holding hands; and in the poster labeled with already tender longing: "Missing: Two Handsome Twins, age 28." As the week lengthened even more elaborate memorial tributes to the Towers appeared: images cut from cardboard, fashioned from aluminum foil, created out of flower petals. The Towers had become the Twins. As dominant architectural monuments the Towers had seemed invincible, arrogant; in their destruction, the Twins assumed the status of bodies, no differ- ent than the other vulnerable and irreplaceable bodies that died with, and within, them. The days remained hot and bright. There was continual returning to the Square and the sensation of being caught in the time warp of a perpetual present, one day becoming the next without the forward feeling of momentum or differentiation. Memorials flowed, melted into each other, filling every available space on the south end of the Square, and fairly overtaking the huge, incongruous monument bronze of George Washington astride his horse. The phenomenon repeated throughout the city. Steve Zeitlin remarks that "New Yorkers showed an amazing instinct and ability to use public spaces all over the city to gather and express themselves. . . . [T]he plethora of shrines and memorials were notable for their dispersion across all five boroughs and beyond, unlike Oklahoma City, or the Vietnam Memorial [or the Penatgon site] where the improvised shrines were centralized. New York City sprouted a vast memorial garden" (2006:104). Firehouse entries and police sta- tions were massed with flowers, photos and messages; Washington Square Park, the Brooklyn Promenade, Tompkins Square Park, Columbus Circle, and numerous other public spaces filled with the material manifestation of sorrow. Neighborhood street corners and brownstone stoops all became memorial ground. All became places where unspeakable and unbearable emotions of loss, anger, and fear were displaced onto the ephemeral.19 The city itself - its infrastructure of manholes, fences, walkways, greenways, street corners, and stoops - became the armature for this ephemeral exposition of grief. The spontaneous shrines of September</page><page sequence="13">September 11 167 11 th were individually made, but massed together in public places they became a collective statement created by a community of strang- ers, all following a common instinct. Ephemeral processes are closer to unconscious than conscious processes in human life. September 11th memorials were assembled with little planning; they were made on impulse, made in a dream, made in a haze of confusion, suffering and disbelief. Yet, they were made. And once created they invited participation. Many shrines received additional items from new visitors to the Square as the weeks wore on. Shrines were also refreshed by their makers, who added new images, flowers and candles. Spontaneous memorials create sites of rare public intimacy. They are, as Harriet Senie suggests, "a populist phenomena, ways for people to mark their own history. They create a public place for individuals and communities united in grief and often anger. And they create for a while, sacred ground" (2006:45). September 11 memorials also acted specifically on behalf of the many families and friends suffering the absence of loved ones at home in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey and elsewhere. They were not allowed to approach, let alone mourn at Ground Zero. Memorial services and official funerals took weeks, months, and for some even years to occur. But images of their dead were housed - kept - in public memorials. We New Yorkers became their keepers. Sacred images of the dead are naturally protected in domestic space, but putting them in public space at Union Square and numerous other locales required faith in the strangers who gathered around them, shielding them as they mourned the lives represented in photos and personal effects. President Bush, calling for a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance on Friday, September 14, instructed Americans to visit their preferred houses of worship during their lunch hour. Unofficially, a widely distributed e-mail sent on September 13th called for nationwide participation in a candlelight vigil Friday evening. The subject line simply read, "Candle vigil tomorrow night - 7 p.m. EST." Thousands responded. Americans from coast-to-coast gathered in small groups in their neighborhoods such as we did in mine. On my street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn we - Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Irish, English, African Americans, fathers, mothers, artists, workers, slackers, students, teenage boys and baby girls - gathered around a mid-block parking sign, prayed for peace, and planted our circle of candles. It was the same everywhere: we were, as the saying expressed it, "all New Yorkers now."</page><page sequence="14">168 KAY TURNER This was also a time when the American flag began appearing everywhere in the city and all across the country: cloth flags, paper flags, plastic flags, sticker flags; flags on doors, on shirts, on cars; flags made of flowers, flags drawn in the dust of the Towers, flags chalked on sidewalks. In Brooklyn the rainbow of national flags demarcat- ing culturally specific blocks and neighborhoods - from Pakistani to Italian, Lebanese to Haitian and many more- were replaced with the Star and Stripes. The unifying symbol of the simultaneously unified and broken nation was seen everywhere, replicated in so many differ- ent ephemeral forms and formats: all immediately put in place and just as easily gone, as most of them were by Christmas. From September 11th until early October, Union Square evolved and changed as a site for recording our incomprehension and grief. No one was ready for the premature "closure" promoted by Mayor Giuliani, who told New Yorkers to go out to eat or have a night at the theater. No one was ready to enter the mourning process which enables acknowledgement, then acceptance of unbearable loss. Candles melted into a small sea of wax and new ones took their place; rain came and along with it came the City of New York Parks and Recreation Department to clean the walkways and dispose of the soggy, ruined memorials.20 But the sun returned, and so did the New Yorkers. New dedications arose where others had washed away. Valiantly, painfully, naggingly, we continued to employ ephemeral resources to install our grief and our already growing commitment to "never forget." Unlike those irreplaceable lives, these fragile memorials could be replenished and re-employed over and over again, until the grief finally turned to mourning and painful, unacceptable absence was accepted. In this period, the burden of the ephemeral was linked to persistence as a populist act of will, to a moral assertion acting against the absorption of September 11th into a rational frame of understanding. Union Square became increasingly a contested site. New Yorkers felt a sense of ownership over the memorials, guarded them, and protested their ultimate diminishment and removal by September's end. In a last attempt to retain the fleeting forms at Union Square, photographs of shrines briefly replaced the real ones that had been removed.21 The persisting presence of the memorials also paralleled the enor- mous persistence of effort at Ground Zero, where workers strained at great risk to their own lives to recover remains of the dead. In a sol- emn ceremony weeks after the attacks, victims' families each had been given a reliquary-like mahogany urn filled with dust from the site,</page><page sequence="15">September 11 169 dust that for too many indexed both the possibility and impossibility of finding remains. Beginning on September 12, 2001, and continuing for years, even today, the proper and respectful disposition of remains has posed ongoing questions and ignited controversy.22 No burden of the ephemeral is as difficult as reckoning with the fleeting, transitory nature of the human body. Here all of the armies of tradition - funer- ary rites, burial customs, memorials, obituaries, death anniversaries, commemorative holidays and feasts - battle the simple and nonnego- tiable fact that we all eventually disappear. In the face of monumental tragedy, especially in cases of anni- hilation, ephemeral remains of the dead become the solid, if frag- mentary, proof that a singular life was lived. Some families held "imitation" funerals, choosing to bury an empty casket, or use it as prop only for the ceremony. But obsession with fragments became the anguished hope of many September 11th victims' families who waited weeks, months, even years to finally "claim" and then officially bury their loved ones. As in Antigone's controversial quest to insure that her brother's battle-torn remains received ritual burial, not be "left unwept, unsepulchred," September 1 1 victims' families held funerals for even the smallest remnant. On September 8, 2003, Michael Paul Ragusa, the last of the 343 martyred NYFD firefighters was finally buried with a High Mass, full honors, and a fire truck procession of his casket. But no remains of Mr. Ragusa were ever recovered at Ground Zero. What constituted evidence of Mr. Ragusa's life was enclosed, unseen, in the wooden coffin: a vial containing a finger-full of his blood, donated some time previously to a bone marrow clinic (Gallahue 2003:1, 7). As of early 2005, over 1 100 victims of September 1 lth in New York had yet to be officially identified, and the city medical examiner's office was still in possession of 10,000 unmatched bone and tissue frag- ments.23 Left in a kind of techno-limbo, waiting for the next break- through in DNA identity science, their grieving families still uncertain, these are the dead who suffer the most difficult assignment of human ephemerality: seemingly to have vanished. MODES OF EPHEMERALITY Ephemeral performativities related to September 11th are many and quite understandably difficult to capture for assessment. What fol- lows is a programmatic outline of some of the most obvious modes of ephemerality in the memorials: installation, fragmentation, repetition,</page><page sequence="16">170 KAY TURNER semiosis (the performance of signs), and gesture. I use the term "mode" to suggest a performative manner or property of expression. I am interested in how different aspects of memorial performances work to answer social need. Like their counterparts, home altars and roadside shrines, ephemeral memorials are performative through multiple channels, many of which - the use of candles is a good exam- ple - are chartered in tradition. September 11th memorials are set interruptively in space: they are installed and installation is an ephemeral mode of practice. In a loose sense analogous to site-specific installation art, memorials are intended to briefly appropriate and inhabit a place with a sculptural insertion of difference creating what De Certeau, writing in a differ- ent context, calls "a space of enunciation" (1988:97). Installation is a dynamic, discursive artistic act. We don't normally expect to see a memorial in a public square, on a brownstone stoop, or outside a subway entrance. Yet, ephemeral means transformed these workaday settings into places for grieving, reflecting, and contesting the losses of that horrible day. As spatial interruptions, ephemeral memorials utilized the spatial dimension to address an aporia of the temporal dimension: the inconceivable sudden death.24 Following installation is the mode of assemblage, the manner of putting distinct memorial elements together into a whole. I have writ- ten previously about the art of assemblage in women's home altars (Turner 1983, 1990, 1999), and there is much that carries over in describing the memorial making process, which like its traditional counterpart is noted for accumulation, layering, mixing, and excess; each composes a loose and dynamic collage-like scene of active com- munication. Altars utilize ephemeral materials but to a lesser degree; the memorial is by definition ephemeral and is composed solely of dispensable materials. In both, the unit of assembly is the fragment, in the sense that parts are made to stand for wholes and bits represent- ing different social domains - nature, family, religion and so on - are pulled together in a single statement of faith (home altars) or grief and remembrance (memorials).25 Overall the aesthetic modes are the same, but their functions in the two settings are quite different. On the home altar the assembly of fragments points to the presence of the unseen divine, whereas in the memorial it points to the absence of a once-seen person. Describing the tokens and symbols of the body - hearts, hands, footprints - repli- cated in many ephemeral forms at Pentagon site memorials, Margaret</page><page sequence="17">September 11 171 Yocom articulates this dialogue between absence and presence: "The fragmented mementos at the memorial pressed visitors to experience presence and absence in conversation with one another." In one sense they testified: ... to people's desire to be physically present at the site, to show up as a "body", a substantial aggregate of people who want to substantiate, to make visible, their intent. . . . People also came to the Pentagon memo- rial to bear witness to the tragedy, to show their care and respect for the dead, and to signal their intent to remember. ... In addition, the images of hands and feet were replicas; as such, they remind people of the actual flesh-warm hands that are not present [Symbolic] images of body fragments on the grassy lawn may well have reminded visitors of the very real body fragments that lay less than a mile away in the charred rubble of the west face of the Pentagon. (Yocom 2006: 83-84) Fragmentation in New York memorials similarly saw the repeated use of hearts, hands, and other symbols such as paper flowers, but the mode also differed in that idiosyncratic fragments from the lives of the numberless dead - a shirt, a hat, a football, a bracelet - overwhelmed the conventional in their profound testament of loss of the whole. Yocom also addresses the repetition and multiplication of frag- ments - one hand gave rise to many, one foot became "a foot, after a foot, after a foot." In New York one candle resulted in thousands more; one flower bouquet multiplied into hundreds. In memori- als, replication and repetition is an ephemeral mode made possible through dispensable materiality. It is truly the mode of performing spontaneity we refer to in calling these settings "spontaneous shrines." So quickly and everywhere did they appear that memorials in New York seemed to spontaneously generate. The creative contagion of shrines counterposed the destruction of the Towers. But as Yocom suggests for the Pentagon, their magnitude alone was not nearly as significant as the communicative power it carried to engage a second dialogue between the finite and the infinite: "At the Pentagon memorial, infinity and finality lay all around. . . . Placing one item alongside a similar item quickly became a representa- tion of the enormity of what had happened, of the thousands dead and the millions who grieved" (2006:84).26 Ephemeral performativity relies on replication and repetition to cite the power of the memorializing process itself, to author its democratic</page><page sequence="18">172 KAY TURNER strategy as one that invites the participation of all who grieve no mat- ter for whom or what. To succeed, Butler insists, a performative must cite: "[T]hat action echoes prior actions, and accumulates the force of authority through the repetition or citation of a prior, authoritative set of practices ... a performative 'works' to the extent that it draws on and covers over the constitutive conventions by which it is mobilized" (1993:226-27). At the Pentagon, at Shanksville, and in New York, memorials cited each other as well as the many that had preceded them in Oklahoma, at Columbine, and in other settings far removed from the United States such as Argentina and South Africa. Each lent the other authority to insist on the performance of grief. The elegiac quality of performative citation (that it draws on what has been, but performs being present now) found perfect expression in the "sponta- neous" iteration of memorials at Union Square and elsewhere. In spontaneous memorial settings, the semiotic burden of the ephemeral is to employ certain material symbols - expendable, easily used up and replenished - to carry universal messages about life and death; the living and the dead; the known and unknown. Inanimate yet vital items of this kind are given a special responsibility to "speak" at times when human speech is impossible or deemed useless. "Solid information" is subsumed by the need to communicate fragile, inar- ticulate feelings. Most important, the memorial itself must serve as a threshold, a ready passageway for communication between the living and the dead. Zeitlin says, "The improvised shrines became places where the living and dead are conjoined. In the poetic language of the shrines, the living and the dead talk to one another" (2006:108). This function was especially necessary in the first days when 14th Street and Union Square separated the living from the dead with a police barricade. The ephemeral composes its own visible, tangible language. Candles, flowers, photos - even teddy bears, key chains, T-shirts, balloons, and boots - speak through channels of beauty, form, light, movement, and touch. They speak through a consensus of the sensate, through an intuition of meaning harbored in traditional knowledge. In memorial settings, tradition impels the ephemeral. We all know what a candle means, don't we?27 Shared symbolism is performed through métonymie operations, often specifically synecdochical. September 11th memorials linked ephemerality with a sudden dependence on metonymy and synecdo- che: the part for the whole in a whole new way. The gravely métonymie</page><page sequence="19">September 11 173 power of these memorials was felt in their universal "standing for" capacity: the candles, the flowers, the flags - all resonant with preor- dained symbolic meanings. The flag to stand for country; the flowers for life's fragility and beauty; the candles for light and hope. In their small, personal details, in their pleading intimacy and idiosyncracy, the memorials proved the power of their sorrowful synecdochical mode: the empty shoes that now stood as attribute of all the roads once walked, and never to be walked again. In fact, the semiosis of the ephemeral memorial is most obvious and efficacious. At heart a ready and easily read system of signs, the memo- rial makes simultaneous use of index, icon, and symbol.28 Its material means - candles, blossoms, paper, trinkets - are affordable, available, and require little in the way of labor or expertise to assemble. A single maker, a family, or a group chooses the signs that feel relevant for them in the moment. No dogma determines the importance or salience of one sign over another. As Zeitlin rightly claims, "Whether their religion was Catholicism or fly-fishing, . . . whether they placed the objects in a spirit of commemoration or simply to mark a spot, mourners communicated with one another in a shared language of symbols" (2006:112). The use value of the ephemeral memorial is purely communicative. Seen as well in other instances of spontaneous shrines, certain of the ephemeral components of September 11th memorials such as candles and photographs deserve semiotic notice. Age-old, universal symbols of hope and remembrance, of communication itself, candles are the sine qua non of ephemeral materiality performing the symbolic.29 A candle's symbolism is constituted in the performative gestures of lighting, burning, and consuming. Candles are defined by their self- evident properties of consumption and by their easy replenishment; they cannot in effect be destroyed or corrupted. The symbolic mean- ing is reconstituted with every match touched to a wick. The use of candles exemplifies the disidentification strategy at the heart of ephemeral memorials: the accoutrements of religion are appropriated for reutilization in the secular realm. Their mean- ings may be tinged with appeal to divine resources but they are not determined by such. September 11th memorials were loaded with Catholic votive candles, many of them featuring images of Our Lady of Guadalupe, St. Jude, or other saints, but few were installed specifi- cally with Catholic intent. Alongside votives, Jewish Yahrzeit candles also burned testifying to the way religious differences were subsumed</page><page sequence="20">174 KAY TURNER by common cause. Against the backdrop of conflagration at Ground Zero, candles were used more often and carried more of the ephem- eral burden of September 11th than any other single thing. In a despairing present, candles shed light on a remembered past and signaled the possibility of a future. Iconicity, the sign function of resemblance, advanced a kind of prophylactic melancholia, allowing in those first weeks for an abso- lute attachment to lost "objects." Suddenly, a dusty souvenir postcard or sun-faded picture poster of the Towers became a meaningful "relic" positioned centrally in a memorial. Ephemeral images of the Towers were claimed as icons in a kind of fetish frenzy described by Diana Taylor: "The loss of the Towers triggered a phantom limb phenomenon - the more people recognized the lack, the more they felt the presence of the absence. Never had the Towers been so vis- ible. Photos, post-cards, T-shirts, banners, and street art immediately hit the streets, performing the existence of what no longer was physically there" (2003:248). In the realm of religion, icons serve as substitutes - the saint's image is a "true likeness" and can thereby be appealed and petitioned. But as Taylor suggests, the excessive accre- tion of likenesses of the Towers only pointed to the pitiful fact that these icons could merely resemble, never substitute for what was gone forever.30 The iconic further proved to be the sign of absence in an even more disturbing sense. Long after their original purpose was abandoned, "missing" posters remained around the city, massed together at subway entrances, posted on apartment doorways, or on long plywood boards nailed up outside hospitals. Soon, many of the identification posters were transferred to memorial settings where now their iconic photos sorrowfully achieved the present perfect tense of Barthes' photo- graphic dictum: "that has been" (1981:76-77). They had been. Photos of the Towers and their missing inhabitants became icons of death. Munoz, following Barthes, says that generally the "photographic text itself ... is already dead; therefore . . . the photograph is already a text of mourning" (1999:67). David Simpson further explains that for Barthes, "all photographs, however innocent and routine - the picnic, the portrait, the still life - bring about 'the return of the dead,' just as 'every photograph is a certificate of presence.' What is present is death" (2006:115). Particularly in the case of likenesses of the dead, there is a double death housed in the iconic rendering and in the ephemeral fragility of the photograph itself. Referring to a snapshot of</page><page sequence="21">September 11 175 his beloved mother when she was young and alive, Barthes describes the feeling of looking at pictures of the now dead: I am alone with it, in front of it. The circle is closed, there is no escape. I suffer, motionless. Cruel, sterile deficiency: I cannot transform my grief, I cannot let my gaze drift; no culture will help me utter this suffering which I experience entirely on the level of the image's finitude. . . . [W]hen [the photograph] is painful, nothing in it can transform grief into mourning. (1981:90) Nothing in those painful photos of the September 11th dead could "transform our grief into mourning." 31 Photographs were enshrined by family and friends of the deceased but numerous memorial items were the gifts of strangers. Towards the beginning of October, victims' families of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing donated over 60,000 teddy bears to the hundreds that already had been placed in settings such as the Policeman's Memorial in Battery Park City.32 Occupying a place in many September 11th memorials throughout the city, teddy bears had already become an ubiquitous feature of memorials addressing the sorrows of Oklahoma City, Columbine, and other tragedies. The teddy bear, bringer of sleep, paragon of innocence, childhood, and the comforts of home, American icon descended from Teddy Roosevelt and Smokey Bear, contends for the most often seen reutilized ephemeral pop culture object in any memorial setting.33 This status has been achieved for many reasons, among them the aforementioned associations with innocence and comfort, as well as their commercial availability, and the prevalence of an overarching American sentimentality of the kind that can take a stuffed animal out of the hands of children and place it into the hands of death. Semiotically, teddy bears seem to derive their symbolic place in memorials from certain processes of substitution at work in American popular culture. On the one hand, they participate in a more general trend towards the sacralization of the secular, emergent in the late 1970s, whereby, for example, the kitsch Elvis statue or the shrine to Madonna (the pop star) are substituted by their faithful fans for con- ventional religious objects. This kind of substitution is also a hallmark of recent postmodern art (the works of Jeff Koons, Matthew Barney, and Nicole Eisenmann come to mind).34 Low art is substituted for high art in the contemporary remaking of classical works or in the elevated</page><page sequence="22">176 KAY TURNER status lent to kitsch objects which have been re-fabricated in high-end materials. Both popular and art world substitutions and appropria- tions of this kind owe a debt to 1960s Pop Art, Warhol being the master practitioner of that era, and before that to various revolutionary art movements of the early 20th century, Dada being the most salient.35 While the impetus for memorial teddy bears may derive in part from these substitution movements, for whom do the teddy bears themselves symbolically substitute? My sense is that teddy bears sub- stitute for the people who place them, or send them to be placed in memorial settings. Often seen near a photo of the deceased or in mas- sive display as in the Battery Park City Policeman's Memorial, teddy bears index the anonymous mourner, the one who lives to guard the remembrance of the dead and comfort the bereaved, the one who resists the death, or protests the victimization, or even who politically refuses the cause for which the dead have died.36 Like the example of teddy bears, the ephemerality and availability of flags promote many uses and interpretations. While it might be assumed that flag-waving in the wake of September 11th was exclu- sively an act of patriotism and unity, many New Yorkers flew the flag as a protective measure: Post 9/11, the fictive identity of the moment was "Ail-American." As usual, anyone who didn't "look" the part - immigrants, certain com- munities of color, marked religious communities - had considerable trouble accessing this fiction In a move of disidentification, the American flag was redeployed as an access code to safety, security, and "American-ness." (Galuszka 2002:6-8) En try way s to food stores, bookshops, and restaurants along the Arab section of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn were draped in American flags that disappeared after the immediate threat of reprisal passed in mid-October. The differential use and interpretation of the flag resonates with Jack Santino's analysis of the range of potential public responses to ephemeral memorials (2006:1 1-12). Their semiotic readiness to inter- pretation urges public engagement with memorials. Combined with shared understandings is the possibility of unique, personal interpre- tations: "Once set out before an undifferentiated public, the polysemy inherent in these assemblages allows for a broad range of readings and associations by passersby, regardless of the initial intentions of the originators" (Santino 2006:11). Both the anonymous creation</page><page sequence="23">September 11 111 and anonymous viewing and participation in public memorials weigh against segmentation of the grieving and mourning process. Anyone who came to pay respects at any memorial was welcome. Anonymity assumed the virtues of ephemerality. One could simply pass by, or stop momentarily, then be gone. Hundreds of New Yorkers did spend those sad September days passing by at Union Square, moving slowly, observantly through the thick sea of tributes, murmuring softly to each other or standing silently, anxiously, absorbing and interpreting the memorials: witnessing, wondering, praying, crying. By conjoining our interests in both the traditional and the ephem- eral, folklore study offers a way to understand strategies of the per- formed symbolic as they unfold over time. Specifically with regard to ephemeral memorials and their lineage in other types of "performa- tive commemoratives," it would be useful to develop a typology.37 Looking across different sites - altars, memorials, shrines, graves - where ephemeral resources engage temporal concerns, we might bet- ter discern "the complex relations of these simple forms."38 Certainly one outcome might be a more definitive semiotic appraisal of the communicative flexibility of common vernacular objects, such as flow- ers, candles, and photos. In different domains of use, they carry dif- ferent meanings. Flowers on a home altar are the regular, often daily offerings that indicate honor and respect for deities and saints. Flower offerings replenish relationship and their ephemeral status invites this understanding. In a different domain, as spontaneous offerings to the dead, flowers on Union Square memorials marked the fleetingness of human life and they also blanketed social wounds with natural beauty. Flowers index the cyclical, the ever-returning, and here they did so in the face of an overwhelming linear anxiety.39 It is not within the scope of this paper to extend this exercise. Suffice it to say that further exploration of the relations among domains of ephemerality may fur- ther our understanding not only of the temporalities associated with the ephemeral, but with the traditional as well. Material ephemeralities are amplified by another primary mode, the gesture, a manner of non-verbal communication using the body itself to "voice" a sign performatively. They belong to the ephem- eral because they are bodily performances in motion, lost except in their present enactment. Gestures may be linked to words - saying "stop" and simultaneously raising the hand for example - but they are independent performatives deriving much of their communica- tive potency by virtue of not requiring spoken language to exercise</page><page sequence="24">178 KAY TURNER meaning. Gestures are culturally specific in their expression of ideas, opinions, and emotions. In gesture, the body becomes a living symbol. Gestures may be conventional, as in folding hands to indicate prayer, or winking to express conviviality; others are of a highly personal nature. We are endeared to intimates by recognition of their habitual performance of idiosyncratic gestures. Origins of the word "gesture" embed the Middle English/Medieval Latin gestura, a mode of action equivalent to the Latin gest, from gerere, to bear, behave, or perform. Gesture is also linked to gest, a story, a romance in verse or prose, a deed, or exploit.40 The etymology is suggestive of the "story" told by the body as it gestures. The performative effectiveness of September 11th memorials, of ephemeral memorials in general, is owed in large part to gesture. The memorial is in many ways a theatre for gesture. The ephemeral act of gesture is linked to the ephemeral materiality of the memorial itself. Memorial accoutrements require gesture: flowers must be placed, candles must be ignited, photos must be kissed and centrally set. The phrase "a gesture of sympathy" comes to mind; grieving gestures performed at the memorials sympathetically connect the living and the dead. One offered flowers, or lighted a candle, kneeled, bowed the head, all in gestures of momentary attachment. Memorial gestures such as these are codified and therefore easily understood and shared. To watch someone else perform them at Union Square was also an invitation to do the same. The requirements of ephemeral gesture are few and yet they impute a rich phenomenology. Ephemeral ges- ture also qualifies as an act of remembrance and of memory. In the moment, a candle was burned in present remembrance of someone lost in the Towers, but the action is also lodged in memory as a key to future meanings. This brief review still leaves a number of ephemeral modes unex- amined, such as the self-organizing nature of ephemeral assemblages, and the relation between linguistic (poetry, messages to the dead) and extra-linguistic modes.41 But I will end this section by suggesting that one does not begin to capture the provocative force of the fleeting in the experience and memory of September 1 lth without also attending to a host of ephemeral operatives outside the memorial domain. One example will suffice for now. The scent of burning candles filled the Square for weeks and the acrid smell of the burning rubble from the Towers lingered in the city for months as an ephemeral testament of what was lost at Ground Zero. Olfactory memory plays a part to this</page><page sequence="25">September 11 179 day in New Yorkers' accounts of September 1 lth. The smell ofthat era remains a performative presence for many. Generally, the ephemeral is not long retained in real time, but certain of the ephemeralities of September 11th, such as odor, are fixed particularly and indelibly in somatic memory. The relationship between trauma and the ephemeral is met in the fleeting sounds, sights, odors, motions, gestures, tears, dust, sweat, and other sensations composing a catalog of potent evi- dence in the bodily archive of those who were here that day.42 EIGHT YEARS AFTER- THE TWIN TOWERS IN MEMORIAL IMAGES Now eight years after, Ground Zero is a construction site and a tour- ist destination for over a million visitors a year. Work is underway to fill the 16 acres of emptiness with a future more conducive to remem- brance. After many interruptions and great contestation, the official memorial "Reflecting Absence" is in the beginning stages of being built towards its completion in late 201 1.43 Those original memorials at Union Square and throughout the city are of course long gone. But in the ensuing years since the tragedy, vernacular ephemeral expres- sions of a remarkably distinguished sort have continued to play a role in speaking to, and speaking for, New Yorkers about September 11th. Official September 11th anniversary commemorations at Ground Zero always see a surge of unofficial ephemeral memorials created around the encompassing fence line. Flowers, candles, and messages are also left at fire and police stations. The creation of memorials serves as a kind of re-enactment, certainly a recapitulation of the impulse to address what is still for many an aching sense of loss. The city's annual Ground Zero ceremony, attended primarily by victims' families, NYPD and NYFD personnel, and civic leaders, is heavily dependent on ephemeral expression: family members leave roses in the Towers' footprints; the names of the dead are read aloud and just as soon, one-by-one, the sound of each name disappears into the morning air; and the four catastrophic moments - when each Tower was hit and when each fell - are remembered in the evanescent tolling of bells. This simple ceremony, now annually repeated, is solemn and emotionally moving in its ephemeral indexicality - it points to what has disappeared forever - and in its paradoxical solicitation of perma- nence: that we must always remember. Originally proposed in the immediate aftermath as "Phantom Towers," then renamed "Towers of Light," and finally called "Tribute</page><page sequence="26">180 KAY TURNER in Light," two massive, white beams shoot into the night sky from Ground Zero on the eve of every September 11 until dawn on September 12, recreating the Twin Towers in ephemeral form.44 The "Tribute" remembers the Towers in a geospatial way. Tracing their outline in the sky, the beams remind New Yorkers of exactly where they stood from vantage points throughout the city, Long Island, and New Jersey. The Towers are momentarily re-placed in visual memory. Emitting a powerful solemnity, the "Tribute" is a most ghostlike, haunted, and haunting iconic representation of the Towers and it mournfully calls to mind the massive loss of life experienced in 2001. September 11th ghosts, or simply thoughts of them, are as Rayner suggests in a different context, "The remainders of human desire to attach life to corpses, presence to absences, and to bring the rep- resentational 'thing' to a life inhabited by meaning" (2006: 66). The ephemerality of the unfinished is defined in the performative pres- ence of ghosts. For so many whose remains were never recovered, for those who died in an agony of unknowing, for those caught in the moment of collapse and for those who knew and loved them, a haunting perdures. Ground Zero, though it visibly reflects nothing sacred, is in fact a grave; unmarked - a place where ghosts still linger in a psychic void of sudden loss. The "Tribute" truly illuminates the performative ephemeral. Though lasting only from dusk to dawn, it potently reasserts the liminal and sacral status of Ground Zero, where ghosts of the Towers and the unidentified, unburied dead yearly rise on beams of light.45 The need to remember, to insert the past into the present, contin- ues through other means that keep the Towers symbolically visible in the city. New Yorkers are a persistent, some would say defiant, lot. And again, as in the days following September 11th, ephemeral modes, aided by traditional expressive strategies, create the format for an insistent, even resistant reassertion of the Twin Towers. Not at Ground Zero, but painted in mural form on the side of a restaurant in Queens; tattooed on a shoulder or forearm; scratched into a subway window; airbrushed on the fender of a cherry red Pontiac; emblazoned on a yellow plastic grocery bag; carried on a key chain; or worn as a costume in the annual West Village Halloween parade. These public apparitions are everywhere, and inside private homes and businesses, too. At Anthony's Deli in Brooklyn, all manner of delicious antipasti is served across a long counter dominated by a wall painting of the Towers, and in Olga Bruh's living room in the Bronx a home altar is</page><page sequence="27">September 11 181 dedicated to those lost and to the place lost with them. Paper ephem- era - signs hanging in bodega windows, stickers on lampposts - still broadcast the image as do various renderings in graffiti and scraffiti.46 Years after the bombing, collapse, and disappearance of the World Trade Center, local practices continue to transform private pain into public art and ephemeral arts still play a central role in memorializing the loss of life and landscape. In the outer reaches of the New York City boroughs these ephemeral images map an "unofficial" memorial composed in spectral repetitions of the Twin Towers. Images of the Towers are mapped onto the city creating vernacular "lieux de mém- oire" or sites of memory (Nora 1996). They act as sentinel placehold- ers for the future, until the official memorial "Reflecting Absence" is completed, but these images also seem to remark a certain contesta- tion, expressing a simmering anger. Legal tangles and pitched battles concerning real estate, insurance pay-outs, and other business matters have significantly slowed efforts to build the official memorial at Ground Zero. At this point in time, Ground Zero itself is truly zeroed out. A walk-by fence museum tells the 9/11 story and lists the names of the dead, but the whole scene is drab and abject, noisy and dirty with construction, certainly not sacralized in any way. One sees the occasional bouquet of flowers or scribbled message tucked in the fence line, but there is little evidence of ephemeral memorializing.47 The nearby Tribute Center, opened in 2006 primarily to assist tourists, does contain a memorial room where victims' families and friends have placed photos and mementos, but it is not a place for spontaneous, public display. Locally dispersed images of the Towers answer the feeling of emptiness downtown by utilizing unbidden, often impromptu expression to assert a memorial impulse and an unwillingness to let go of the past: that "never forget" refers both to that single infamous day, and to all the days that preceded it.48 A performative politics of remembrance and memory was enacted in the creation of September 11th memorials and it extends to this day in the vernacular forms I have just mentioned. Known primarily by their fleeting evanescence, the varied ephemeralities of September 1 lth paradoxically offer "solid" evidence of a profound desire to assert the necessity of memory, for recognizing and holding the utter impor- tance of human memory. Patricia Hampl claims: The beauty of memory rests in its talent for rendering detail, for paying homage to the senses, its capacity to love the particles of life,</page><page sequence="28">182 KAY TURNER the richness and idiosyncrasy of our existence. The function of mem- ory, while experienced as intensely personal, is surprisingly political. (2000:33) Despite official politics that push ever forward in the name of rebuild- ing (and forgetting, or at least ignoring except on anniversaries), there is a real sense in New York that the memory of September 1 lth is lodged in the richness Hampl describes. Such richness is owned in resistance to standard formulas that assume a "healthy" return to nor- malcy or require a denial of what Diane Goldstein and Diane Tye call "the common vernacular values of tradition" (2006:250). Following Bold, Knowles, and Leach (2002) they distinguish hegemonic cultural memory from cultural counter-memory, which is "'the various kinds of oppositional or resistant memory making'" that includes memorials but as Goldstein and Tye warn, is not exhausted by them (2006:251). September 11th has birthed many ephemeral strategies of remem- brance and interpretation and these are at least partially concerned with a rethinking, actually a re-feeling and a remaking, of the social usefulness of grief, mourning, and melancholia. How do we under- stand the burden of the ephemeral in relation to Freud's famous distinction between mourning (the acceptable, healthy separation from the lost object) and melancholia (the pathological attachment to it, the refusal to lose the past in favor of a brighter future) ([1917] 1957:243-244)? Melancholia has a somewhat troubled history of interpretation, but certain scholars (Mufioz 1999; Cvetkovich 2003; and Eng and Kazanjian 2003) offer reassessments that are useful for my work here.49 Eng and Kazanijian suggest that in melancholia "the past is neither fixed nor complete. Unlike mourning, in which the past is declared resolved, finished, and dead, in melancholia the past remains steadfastly alive in the present . . . and might be said to con- stitute ... an ongoing and open relationship with the past" (2003:3-4). Munoz compares melancholia to disidentification saying that both are "structures of feeling" that work "to retain the problematic object and tap into the energies that are produced by contradictions and ambiva- lences" (1999:71).50 As we see the ephemeral at work in the aftermath of September 11th, it seems to make a claim on the past and present at once, and perhaps this is the way such burden as I have described in this paper is finally released. What these authors claim for a newly conceived melancholia persuades me to make a similar claim for the ephemeral.</page><page sequence="29">September 11 183 It too resists conclusion, either by clinging too solidly to the past or by fully absolving relationship to it; yet, the ephemeral is wholly per- formative in the now of being. It allows for attachment or for separa- tion - in the moment. This is its politics of resistance to any conformity. The ephemeral makes much of the day by anointing both time's gift and its curse. Ephemeral expressions erupted within hours of the September 11th attacks and continuing to this day they arbitrate loss and creativ- ity. Eng and Kazanjian describe a politics of mourning "as that creative process mediating a hopeful or hopeless relationship between loss and history." Counterintuitively, they lend to loss a creative instead of a negative quality saying that "loss is inseparable from what remains, for what is lost is known only by what remains of it, by how these remains are produced, read, and sustained" (2003:2). September 11th memo- rials and subsequent related performances of the ephemeral link the lost to what remains, to who remains: us. A GENEALOGY OF EPHEMERAL MEMORIALS Many of the essays in Santino's collection contribute to a chro- nology of spontaneous shrines that include and precede those of September 11. I add my own take here because I am interested in constructing an ever more detailed chronicle - really a geneal- ogy - of the practice. I am concerned with the phenomenology of the ephemeral as expressed in memorials and with the forces of social change and resistance that shape it over time. In 1999 the street where he had lived in Lower Manhattan became impass- able, so great was the spontaneous memorial outpouring for John F. Kennedy, Jr., but nothing like it occurred in Dallas or anywhere else in 1963 after the assassination of his much more famous father, President John F. Kennedy. My preliminary research places first evidence of this new memorial custom in the United States in Manhattan on the night of December 8, 1980.51 As news spread of the murder of John Lennon outside The Dakota apartments, where he lived with his wife Yoko Ono, shocked New York fans of the musician began gathering at the site bearing pic- tures, flowers, candles, and singing farewells. Immediately and spon- taneously the apartment entry became a point of contact between the dead hero and his living public, who materialized and discharged their grief in gifts of ephemera. So many distraught fans congregated that Yoko asked them to move across the street to Central Park. She called</page><page sequence="30">184 KAY TURNER for a vigil in the park on December 14th that was attended by thou- sands. The ephemeral accoutrements of mourning came with them and makeshift shrines appeared in force throughout the area. These early shrines were likely helped into being by available John Lennon/ Beatles merchandise (album covers, John dolls, and so on) that fans had on hand and by the proliferation of a photocopied picture of Lennon wearing a New York City t-shirt. The photo gained icon sta- tus in the emergent memorials. In 1981 the park area they gathered in was officially named Strawberry Fields. It became the scene of an ongoing Lennon memorial site, active to this day, especially on his birthday and the anniversary of his death. What precedes the Lennon memorials of 1980 is approximated in the outpouring of tribute at the "graveside shrine" of Jim Morrison, the Doors lead singer, who died of a drug overdose in Paris in 1971 and was subsequently buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris (Thomas 2006:l7-22).52 I recently visited Père Lachaise and was moved by the many current ephemeral memorials attached to the tombs of queers, marginals, and iconoclasts including Morrison, Oscar Wilde, Colette, Edith Piaf, and Marcel Proust. Attesting to a long-term devotion, regularly replenished ephemeral means appeared to be keeping past lives - some gone for over 100 years - active in contem- porary memory. If as Jonathan Lohman suggests, cemeteries became controlled sites by the turn of the twentieth century (2006:200; see also Hass 1998; Senie 2006), and as Hege Westgaard suggests, the spontaneous, anonymous shrine is a healthy antidote to the tabooing of grief (2006:166-69), these Parisian graveside shrines, especially Jim Morrison's, help explain the crucial John Lennon moment of 1980 quite well: the time was right for the 1970s Morrison phenomenon to jump the graveyard and the Atlantic in a slightly new form, further breaking the taboo against public grief in the name of another musical and political iconoclast. From the early 1980s forward the phenomenon of ephemeral memorials has repeated. In the United States, it was given primary impetus by the completion in 1982 and soon thereafter the spontaneous reutilization of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Much has been written about this national monument which instantly became, and still is, a profound meeting place between the personal and political and the ephemeral and traditional. With the exception of flower wreaths laid at them on official commemorative holidays, war monuments have not historically served as interactive mourning sites.</page><page sequence="31">September 11 185 The bereaved are rarely seen at these monuments, which do not invite remembrance of the individual soldier. Rather, they stand for the per- manency of the empire or nation-state, recognizing only the sacrifice of the many to maintain its power and sovereignty. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial brought a status change.53 The individual deaths carved into its black granite surface retained their uniqueness as individuals because family and friends commanded an informal process of communicating this by communicating with them. Leaving ephemeral signs and symbols (flowers, candles, written mes- sages, flags, and personal effects such as military medals, photos, items of clothing and much more) on the walkway in front of their loved ones' names, praying, crying and storytelling there, the living "spoke" to their dead. Here was the beginning of a counter-monument movement privi- leging the ephemeral to ignite the task of symbolically holding the memory of individual soldiers at a standard higher than, or at least in consort with official memory of the war itself, a war troubled by years of protest against it, a war that was never won, a war that divided the nation, opening a gap between official and unofficial sentiments regarding it. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial underscores what Santino says is crucial for a general theory of spontaneous shrines as they have evolved from other expressions: "[T]he conjunction of the memorializing of personal deaths within the framework of the social conditions that caused those deaths" (2006:5). Simpson calls the ephemera left at the Memorial "second order commemorations" (2006:77) whereby people take charge of meaning at this public site and create their own sense of history. Ephemeral modes - self- organization, assemblage, accumulation, fragmentation - lend organic flexibility to this process. All the parts are not filled in; there is room to grow meanings of remembrance, also room for them to disappear, be replaced, or renewed.54 Lecturing in New York in 2002 on points for consideration in designing the World Trade Center memorial, landscape architect Paul Morris (a consultant for the permanent memorials commissioned for Mt. St. Helen's, Columbine, and Oklahoma City) noted that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial changed future considerations of how official United States memorial monuments are to be understood and used. Morris says that memorials "are now about the living as much as they are for the dead."55 Mourners - especially victims' relatives and friends - become actively involved in advocating their establishment</page><page sequence="32">186 KAY TURNER immediately following a tragedy. This new sense of advocacy is spurred in part by the same emotional urgency and democratization that drives the creation of spontaneous memorials. The 1980s era proves to be critical in addressing and redressing public and national trauma in other arenas additional to Vietnam. Public expression of empathy for once-forgotten, denied, or erased historical trauma begins to rise. Marita Sturken (1997) emphasizes that in this period, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, and the AIDS epidemic all start to be recognized in memorial monuments and muse- ums, the national AIDS Memorial Quilt, and so on. Native Americans also began a process of revisiting and reclaiming historical sites of trauma such as Wounded Knee.56 While praising Sturken's approach for the legitimacy it brings, Ann Cvetkovich, speaking of AIDS activ- ism, suggests that "it also mutes the critical and oppositional force of the more marginalized forms of activism." She calls for a focus that "aims to illuminate a counterpublic memory that has a more critical relation to the more prominent national representations of AIDS" (2003:162). Such counter-public memory is lodged, for example, in the way HIV/AIDS memorials were used creatively as sites of healing, remem- brance, and protest during the early years of the American AIDS cri- sis. By the mid-1980s, as the disease ravaged urban gay communities in New York and San Francisco, portable memorials were included as part of mock funerals, sit-ins, and Gay Pride parades. In part a transposition of the countercultural impulse felt at Père Lachaise, Strawberry Fields, and at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, they also signaled what Michael Moon calls "the specifically queer energies" at work in the experiences of mourning related to AIDS deaths in the gay community. Moon declaims, "I invoke the social in the face of a predominantly privatized, heterosexualized, teleologized and 'task-oriented' conception of grieving and mourning." This "invoked social," more particularly an "aesthetic process," included making and maintaining memorials (quoted in Munoz 1999:67, 68). My own experience of this era suggests that the ephemeral memo- rial arts were learned by mourning men from their lesbian and feminist friends, who since the early 1970s had been reclaiming and reinventing the usefulness of personal altars to address secular crises of both a political and individual nature. These women taught their gay friends to make altars at home, first as sites of healing, then, too often, as memorials.57 Also influential in this period was the unusually</page><page sequence="33">September 11 187 wide dissemination beyond its culturally specific locus, the seculariza- tion, and later the commercialization, of Mexican Dias de Los Muertos (Days of the Dead) ofrenda (altar) traditions brought north in the late 1970s and early 1980s by activist Chicana artists such as Amalia Mesa Bains and Kathy Vargas.58 It is worth considering that many of the early adopters of secular ephemeral memorials were marginals, outcasts, immigrants, radicals, and artists. This cursory account points to a confluence of cultural strategies in the 1980s resulting in new possibilities for response to tragedy. These were in turn directly influenced by intersecting social, cultural, and popular reforms of the 1960s and early 1970s. Liberation movements - civil rights, women's, gay, Chicano, and Native American - gave rise to, among other reforms, an increasing sense of religious democracy.59 One result of this shift was the for- mation of neo-traditional religious communities founded in earth- based, elemental ritual and ceremony. New religious traditions were formulated with available means: ephemeral fundaments of the earth itself - water, air, fire, earth - sufficed as sacraments. Simultaneously, radical changes in art practices including Pop Art, Happenings, Earth Art, women's political and autobiographical art, street art, altar art,60 and numerous other politicized "schools" ofthat era facilitated a more expansive use of ephemeral materials, including the re-contextualiza- tion of vernacular religious imagery and objects in secular productions and performances.61 As I suggested earlier, the stage was set by 1980 for the emergent period of the ephemeral memorial as we know it today. Grounded in a new sense of religious democracy and the expansion of public arts, the practice was in its florescence by the mid-1990s, playing a central part in a much wider public response to tragic celebrity deaths, exem- plified most notably by Princess Diana's demise in Paris in 1997, and the deaths resulting from a marked increase in domestic, school, and political violence. Spontaneous memorials took on an increasingly important role in response to the murders of government work- ers and their children at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 and of innocent students at Columbine High School in Denver in 1999. The accidental collapse of the Texas A&amp;M bonfire, also in 1999, killed twelve students, bringing rupture and sorrow to that campus community which notably responded with elaborate shrines dedicated to each of the dead, as well as more typical fleeting memorials.62</page><page sequence="34">188 KAY TURNER The mid-1990s forward to the present also records the rise of anonymous urban memorials recognizing sudden individual deaths at the sites of violent gang encounters and urban traffic accidents. In New York City, since at least the end of the 1990s, The New York Times and the Daily News have published numerous photographs depicting the "makeshift memorials" intermittently erected in the five boroughs. The notable increase in these expressions over the past ten years is due at least in part to the local media attention they have received.63 They were already news items before September 1 lth and their place in the daily spin likely lent New Yorkers' some familiarity with the memorial practice as they performed it after the attacks. "Makeshift memorials" join the older urban tradition, memorial walls, the work of Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other graffitti and mural artists, begun as early as 1988 in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and other cities.64 This genealogy, though certainly ripe for further consideration, sets the ephemeral memorial phenomenon in broad context suggesting that, taken together, these movements, reforms and practices pro- duced a cultural shift in the understanding of who owns the symbolic means of religious and spiritual expression, especially as it pertains to meeting the existential problem of tragic death. Such ownership shifted in effect from the church to the streets, from the priests to the masses. The means of expression shifted from the permanence of glittering gold to the fleetingness of flaming candles. Freeing cer- tain symbols - the cross, the Buddha, the hand of Fátima, the votive candle - from their ecclesiastical assignments affirms an unspoken but shared understanding of their meanings and human usefulness. In the face of the dwindling power of religious institutions to affirm our transcendence over death and our increasing unwillingness to assign the meaning of life exclusively through such institutions, an ephem- eral "folk religion" of flowers, candles, photos and teddy bears utilizes a democratic strategy of disidentification and appropriation to claim ontological, even teleological, interpretation for ourselves.65 CONCLUSION I began this essay with James Merrill's translation of Cecilia Meireles's poem "Vigil." Merrill's Collected Poems had just been published in the fall of 2001 and I discovered this poem as I paged through the volume with a friend on the weekend after September 11th. I had already attended the first vigil at Union Square on September 12 and had</page><page sequence="35">September 11 189 gathered with my fellow New Yorkers for a second on September 14. By this time the ephemeral memorials were in full display and use throughout the city. Meireles's words haunted me with their clear, nonnegotiable instruction: "As the companion is dead, so we must all together die somewhat. . . . Faith in him, the lost companion - what but that is left? To die ourselves somewhat through him we see today quite dead." We had all died somewhat in the face of comprehending the loss of those who were quite dead at Ground Zero. These were the incontrovert- ible facts. But our partial death was also a command to keep faith in those lost companions, to keep vigil.66 Between the quite dead and the somewhat dead was remembrance lodged in the fragile beauty of those shrines that would themselves disappear to be replaced by memory. NOTES 1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at a forum "Memory Matters - Responses to September 11: Images, Artifacts, Words 1," held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the American Folklore Society in Rochester, New York, October, 2002. I thank Diane Goldstein, editor of this special issue of Western Folklore, for committing me to expansion of the original talk. This paper also owes a debt of thanks to my students and colleagues in the Performance Studies Department at NYU and Carolyn Dinshaw, former director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Studies at NYU. Some of my general thinking on ephemerality was first developed in a course I have occasionally taught called "Fast Cheap and Out of Control: Ephemeral Cultures/ Sexual Cultures." The course investigates moments - quickly expended, but intense - wherein codes of sexuality and gender can be deciphered in performances that reveal their constructed nature. My sources for this course are based in folklore as well as in feminist and queer studies. Students read about fairies in Newfoundland side-by-side with tales of apparitional lesbians and they investigate sites of ephemeral display: memorials, home altars, and Day of the Dead of rendas, longstanding arenas of my interest, intensified in the wake of September 1 lth. 2. The deaths suffered in the United States on September 1 lth have resulted in extensive attention paid to victims' remembrance and to the creation of their memorials. This paper is but one of thousands of testimonies to and interpretations of those deaths. But as Judith Butler argues (in Simpson 2006:156), the over determined mourning of some comes at the expense of "disavowing" the task of mourning and ritually remembering thou- sands of others - U.S. and international soldiers, Afghanis, Iraqis, Kurds, citizens, teachers, lawyers, doctors, journalists, mothers, fathers, children and grandparents - who have died as a result of the events of September</page><page sequence="36">190 KAY TURNER 11 th. I dedicate "The Burden of the Ephemeral" to all who have died because of what happened that day. 3. For works on paper ephemera see, Dundes (1975), Preston (1995), and Yoder (2005). See Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998) on museum collections and tourist art. Suzanne Seriff 's work on folk art and recycling points the way towards understanding ephemeral materiality as worthy of con- sideration from various perspectives including the economic and politi- cal. Seriff (1996) and others working on recycling also provide detailed exposition of processes involved in the circulation and recreation of what appear to be expendable, "useless" goods. 4. See Turner (1983, 1990, 1999, and 2007). 5. For additional sources on the Mexican American folk Catholic topos of death and remembrance, see Turner and Jasper (1987); Gosnell and Gott (1989); Griffith (1992); Everett (2002); and Marchi (2006). Holly Everett's (2002) work on roadside shrines in Texas effectively moves away from cultural specificity towards phenomenology in her useful discussion encompassing cross-cultural appropriation and transmission of this tradition. Given her treatment and my own experience of this tradition in Texas, it is perhaps the roadside shrine - by virtue of its visual accessibility and potential for appropriation, no less its beauty and easy recognition as a token of remembrance in the face of death - that more than any other memorial form in tradition models for ephemeral memorials. Like ephemeral memorials, roadside shrines are what Everett, citing Zimmerman (1997:5), calls a kind of "self-assigned grief work. . . . The construction of memorial assemblages has allowed them [individuals] to incorporate their memories of, and abiding affection for, their loved ones into the everyday life of their families." Simultaneously they have sustained the community ties the deceased may have had in life by (re) creating a public site which friends may visit anonymously and quickly" (2002:99). Also see, Santino (1992, 2001) and Owens (2006). 6. Larger issues of folklore and human mortality are at play throughout this paper. I have found certain writers outside our field to be extremely helpful in settling on central concerns. Temporal dilemmas posed by the death of the human body are considered by Robert Pogue Harrison in his book The Dominion of the Dead (2003). Harrison's thesis is suggestive: "Humans bury not simply to achieve closure and effect a separation from the dead but also and above all to human- ize the ground on which they build their worlds and found their histories. . . . [H]umanity is not a species (Homo sapiens is a species); it is a way of being mortal and relating to the dead. To be human means above all to bury. ... As homo sapiens we are born of our biological parents. As human beings we are born of the dead - of the regional ground they occupy, of the languages they inhabited, of the worlds</page><page sequence="37">September 11 191 they brought into being, of the many institutional, legal, cul- tural, and psychological legacies that, through us, connect them to the unborn" (2003: xi). 7. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines ephemeral as "beginning and ending in a day; hence short-lived." From the Greek ephemeros meaning daily, lasting but a day, and applied to ephemeron, an order of insects, such as the mayfly, which in their adult stage live only a few hours or days. Common synonyms include transitory, fleeting, evanescent, and momen- tary. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ephemeral. 8. José Munoz's work has added much to my understanding of the relation- ship between ephemerality and performance. His essay "Ephemera as Evidence" (1996), on ephemeral queer performances, concerns the prob- lem of historical erasure. Though aimed quite differently than my work, he outlines certain useful definitional concepts that I follow here. 9. Munoz follows Raymond Williams's ([1977] 1986: 128-35) seminal notion that "art conveys, translates and engenders structures of feeling - tropes of emotions and lived experience." 10. Perspectives on the folklore and ontology of death range far and wide; among others, see Iwasaka and Toelken (1994), Walker (1995), and Santino (2006b, 2006c). For additional sources on burial, bereavement, and commemoration see, Tarlow (1999), Harrison, (2003), and Lin, et al. (n.d.). 11. I think there is some usefulness in noting and perhaps distinguishing spontaneous shrines (or spontaneous memorials) by their unpremedi- tated timeliness to the occasion of tragedy. My term "ephemeral memo- rial" emphasizes the transitory and may refer to either spontaneous or deliberate constructions. I would call "spontaneous" the memorials that came up immediately in the wake of September 11th; "ephemeral" the memorials that were made in the second and third weeks. However, "ephemeral memorial" is the broader term. Santino's "performative com- memorative" covers the broadest field, a term he says "includes but is not restricted to spontaneous shrines" (2006c: 11). 12. An excellent introduction to folklore and performance theory is found in Kapchan 2003. For sources on performance and performativity, see Austin ([1962] 1975); Butler (1993); Phelan (1993); Phelan and Lane (1998); Munoz (1999); and Rayner (2006). 13. The dominance of language-based performativity theory stems from Austin ([1962] 1975) and Searle (1969), both of whom are concerned with the authority of speech and ultimately of language. Numerous schol- ars have critiqued and extended Austin and Searle. See, for example, Shoshana Felman ([1980] 2003) who reads Austin with a slant that affirms the speech act as a bodily act. Performance Studies offers an abundance of insightful scholarship that addresses and redresses Austin along lines</page><page sequence="38">192 KAY TURNER that inform my concerns here. See Phelan (1993), Munoz (1999), Taylor (2003), and Schechner (2006). 14. Numerous first-person accounts of September 11th in New York have been published. See Baer (2002a) and Spiegelman (2004). Hundreds of additional testimonies are available on the Internet. Both the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and the Oral History Research Office at Columbia University maintain collections of first-person 9/11 accounts. I am currently working on a 9/11 story collection project that records New Yorkers' recollections of the singular moment in which they recognized the shift from a pre-September 11th to a post-September 11th reality. 15. The distance from Union Square at 14th Street to Ground Zero is two miles. Barricades at 14th Street prevented passage to downtown for about a week; then the barricade was moved south to Canal Street where it remained in place during the second week after the attacks. Finally, the barricade shifted to Chambers Street near Ground Zero and eventually a fence was built around the periphery of the disaster area and a "viewing platform" was put in place in early 2002. 16. I thank Greta Pieri Galuszka for permission to quote from her unpub- lished paper "Towards a Critical Reading of Post-9/11 Ephemera" (2002). Written for my graduate class on ephemerality in Spring 2002, Greta's paper insightfully analyzes commercially manufactured 9/11 ephemera. 17. September 11th was about seeing, looking, viewing, and gazing and also about taking pictures, shooting video: documenting. See Taylor (2003) and Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (2003). Photos of the planes hitting the Towers, photos of the burning buildings, photos of people running from the Towers, photos of the collapse, photos of photos of the missing, photos of the memorials: September 11th is popularly considered to be the most photographed event in history. Photographs were used as proof, as reportage, as tragedy souvenirs, and aside from the obvious, the act of photographing was used as a distancing mechanism, a mode of protec- tion. Looking through the lens to look at others, not wanting nakedly to see them in their sorrow. The inability to look combined with the fervent desire to look, to connect. In the first week, I took very few photos. I could not overcome the existential problem of documentation in a time of grief. In grief one clings inconsolably to the past, to what was and can never be again. Documentation is done with an eye to the future. Documentation is essen- tially a preservative act; it assumes a future. This assumption is lost in grieving; grieving is performed in an unending present filled with desire for an irretrievable past. 18. See Zeitlin (2006) for an in-depth description with examples and photo documentation of poems and messages to the dead placed on New York memorials. Yocom (2006) addresses the same phenomenon at the Pentagon site.</page><page sequence="39">September 11 193 19. Zeitlin (2006:105-06) describes the "unspoken partnership" that grew up between memorial makers and their landlords or the police. No official permission to make the memorials was granted from the city or any other civil or religious institution (Zeitlin 2006:104). None was necessary. The sheer number and wide dispersal of spontaneous shrines in New York was unusual, due, as Zeitlin suggests, to New Yorkers' instinct to use public spaces for personal expression. But the dispersal may also have derived from New Yorkers' general familiarity with culturally-specific shrine traditions - Hindu shrines in Queens, Catholic Italian yard shrines in Brooklyn, HIV/AIDS memorials in Manhattan - that invited imitation in a time of need. 20. See Steve Zeitlin and liana Harlow (2001b) concerning the controversy over how much of the memorial remains should be preserved. Zeitlin's organization City Lore was active in assuring preservation of memorial examples. For early 2002, City Lore organized "Missing: Streetscape of a City in Mourning," an exhibition at the New York Historical Society featuring a number of salvaged memorials. It should be noted that while Union Square was primarily a memorial site, it was also ground for the intersection of "mourning and militancy," to use Douglas Crimp's phrase. Posters, banners, and performance works protested the bellicose strains that began issuing from Washington within days after the attacks. 21. In the first ten days after the attacks, the mood at Union Square was somber and respectful. Ad hoc performances by musicians, actors, poets, and artists were heartfelt accompaniments to the memorial scene. But by the end of the third week in September Union Square had taken on a distinctly different feel. A circus-like, somewhat depraved, scene evolved; hippies, panhandlers, and ghouls were now the primary "mourners." After a predicted rainfall for September 19, memorials were removed for "safety reasons." New memorials were taken away immediately, in effect prohibiting them and by the end of September they were gone. After the war with Afghanistan began on October 8, the Square reclaimed its long tradition as a gathering place for anti-war protesters. Around the city, the memorials disappeared from sight. As the downtown area opened up to workers, residents, and visitors in some memorials were made on the periphery of Ground Zero and at Battery Park. St. Paul's Chapel of Trinity Episcopal Church was the scene of a memorial that surrounded the churchyard fence. But finally, like all things ephemeral, the down- town memorials disappeared. 22. As recently as August 2007, WNYC radio reported that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision to move the annual September 11th commemora- tion out of Ground Zero to a nearby park had unleashed the fury of victims' families, who remain dedicated to the belief that Ground Zero is a sacred burial ground to which they should have access for the purpose of mourning.</page><page sequence="40">194 KAY TURNER 23. See "Ground Zero Forensic Work Ends," www.cbsnews.com/ stories/2005/02/23/national. 24. Further interpretation of ephemeral memorials would gain a great deal from a thorough investigation of the temporal/spatial axes that intersect them. Remembrance and commemoration, the hallmarks of these memo- rials, are made possible by such intersection. For useful introductions to temporal/spatial theories and histories see, Kern ([1983] 2003) and Friedland and Bowen (1994). 25. Fragmentation and repetition, along with collage, assemblage, and mon- tage are critical modes in arts practices of the twentieth and twenty- first centuries. See Benjamin (1968); Kern ([1983] 2003); Perloff (2003 [1986]); Teitelbaum (1992); and Nochlin (1994). Each of these modes is heavily reliant on ephemerality both in terms of materiality and tempo- rality. Their evolution and dissemination into popular arts practices is crucial for understanding the emergence of spontaneous memorials. See Olalquiaga ( 1 992) and Cerny and Seriff ( 1 996). 26. Yocom's (2006) work on the Pentagon memorials is very useful for mine on modes of the ephemeral in the New York shrines, especially her dis- cussion of image fragmentation and replication. 27. See Miguel Tamen's "Friends of Interprétable Objects" (2001) for an interesting discussion of how objects are animated through interpreta- tion. Tarnen claims that interprétable objects require a "society of friends" who are in agreement regarding the treatment of certain objects in recog- nizable ways (2001:3-4). Participation in spontaneous shrines depends on such agreement; the "friends" (actually strangers) who added flowers to shrines at Union Square shared in an understanding of how those flowers were to be interpreted by others. Olalquiaga (1992) offers useful insights on the postmodern relationship between religious imagery, primarily Roman Catholic, and kitsch. This relationship has spawned popular rec- ognizability and appropriation of religious images for use in spontaneous shrines. Additional sources for understanding the postmodern use of religious objects in ephemeral memorials to consolidate secular griev- ing practices include Olalquiaga (1998), McDannell (1995), and Morgan (1998). On the social life of popular objects generally, see Stewart ([1984] 1993); Appadurai (1986); Cerny and Seriff (1996); Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998, 2003), and Rand (2005). 28. These days, semiotics is underutilized as an analytical tool, but I still find it useful in breaking out the constitutive communication elements of ephemeral memorials. I recall Umberto Eco's claim in his novel The Name of the Rose (1983): "Signs and signs of things are used only when we are lacking things." So much of what we lacked after September 11th was replaced by "signs and signs of things." My approach follows Sebeok (1969), Barthes (1968, 1972), and Jakobson (1971). See also Jakobson (1960) on metonymy and metaphor.</page><page sequence="41">September 11 195 29. Candles, tapers, and oil lamps have a long history in use as devotional instruments, from at least the late Neolithic period (4000 BCE) in Old Europe. In Christian tradition, tapers were used at funerals by the 3rd century and burned in cemeteries by the 4th century. The practice began in the 6th century of lighting candles in front of a saint's image to show devotion and obtain favor; see Walsh (1993: 55). Votive candles for these purposes are still very much in use and they are the kind of candle most seen in September 11th ephemeral memorials. Votives have enjoyed increased crossover appeal from the religious to the secular in the past four decades. Seen on secular altars (Turner 1999), positioned in front of spray-painted memorial walls, as central items in ephemeral memorials preceding those of September 11, and even as wholly decorative table pieces, these cheap and readily available appropriations have achieved remarkable popular status worthy of full investigation. 30. See Galuszka (2002), Taylor (2003 ), and Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (2003) for further description and interpretation of 9/11 souvenirs. 31. A full discursive interpretation of the "missing" photos and their transfor- mation into memorial photos remains to be done; see Taylor (2003) and Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (2003). Barthes's Camera Lúcida (1981) is perhaps the best text for approaching the temporal problematic inherent in view- ing photographs of the dead. Other sources include Benjamin (1997); Hirsch (1997); Munoz (1999); Batchen (2001); and Baer (2002b). Art his- torian Daile Kaplan (2003) uses the term "pop photographica" to describe the convergence of photography and popular culture beginning in the nineteenth century. Almost since the time of their invention, photographs have played a popular role in memorializing the dead. An array of nine- teenth and twentieth-century memorial keepsakes feature photographs of the deceased. See also Batchen (2001). 32. Personal communication to the author by Pam Bell, archivist for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, August 15, 2007: "The Oklahoma City National Memorial sent 3 truck trailers of 40,000 lbs. to New York City after 9/11. The estimated bear count was between 60,000-80,000." 33. On the history of the teddy bear, a child's toy descended from the legend of Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt's refusal to shoot a bear, see Schoonmaker ([1981] 2000) and King (1997). The familiar image of Smokey Bear, a no-nonsense guardian of public forests who is also fearless in the face of fire, is also relevant to an understanding of how toy bears come to substitute for humans as not only mourners, but also as secular guard- ians of the dead. The religious image of the angel as guardian was seen less on memorials than might have been expected. More often the dead were themselves referred to as angels in messages addressed to them and placed in memorials. The TYCO Toys Beanie Babies craze of the 1990s may also have fueled use of stuffed bears in memorial settings. After</page><page sequence="42">196 KAY TURNER Princess Diana's tragic death in 1997 the company immediately issued a Princess Diana tribute bear, fabricated in royal purple and embroidered with a small white rose, referring to the song Elton John sang at her funeral and to the thousands of bouquets of roses left in her memory at Kensington Palace. 34. The artist Jeff Koons is well-known for heightening the aesthetic con- sideration and monetary value of banal pop images (e.g., Elvis figurines and stuffed animals) by recasting them in new materials (e.g., porcelain or stainless steel) or remaking them in large, sometimes gigantic sizes as he did in 1992 with "Puppy," a forty-foot high rendering of a stuffed ani- mal with fur made of thousands of blooming flowers. Shown in Germany and Spain, then at Rockefeller Center, the sculpture drew thousands of admiring viewers, including myself. In "Puppy," Koons says he intended a piece that would "deal with the human condition, and this condition in relation to God. I wanted it to be a contemporary Sacred Heart of Jesus." In the next breath, however, he announces that, "It doesn't come from any religious background . . . just from sort of absorbing Baroque culture, Catholicism in church imagery" (Tomkins 2007:61-62). Once wholly secular, both "Puppy" and "Teddy" now enjoy the claim of sacred icons: "Puppy" by proclamation of the artist, "Teddy" by proclamation of the people. 35. Certainly there are many art and cultural histories to follow in attempting to unpack the emergence of the teddy bear as memorial icon. See Turner and Jasper (1987); Danto (1992); Mamiya (1992); Olalquiaga (1992, [1998] 2002); McDannell (1995); and selected essays in Santino (2006a). Mamiya, for example, suggests that 1960s Pop Art's image appropriation and validation of kitsch are the lynchpins separating modern from post- modern art. Pop's links to consumer culture promoted the use of com- mercial images from advertising. He also addresses Pop Art's defiance of narrative conclusion. Images are allowed meaning that is not connected to their role in a narrative structure. 36. See Yocom (2006:74, 82-85) for her discussion of self-referential images of hearts, hands, and footprints that gave mourners a feeling of identity with the Pentagon victims. 37. After the tragic bonfire collapse at Texas A &amp; M in November 1999, folk- lorist Sylvia Grider, based at A &amp; M, directed the Bonfire Memorabilia Project to collect, catalog, and inventory thousands of artifacts from the various spontaneous shrines created after the disaster. The content analysis coming out of this project is invaluable for the kind of typology I envision. See Grider (2006) for a full description of the project. See also Owens (2006) for her work on typing roadside memorials in Louisiana. 38. The phrase is a citation of Roger Abraham's term from his essay "The Complex Relation of Simple Forms" (1981). 39.

The proposal for "Phantom Towers" was made immediately after the attacks and featured on the cover of the New York Times Magazine on September 23, 2001. The "Tribute in Light" was originally sponsored by the arts organization Creative Time and the Municipal Art Society. It debuted for the six-month anniversary on March 11, 2002, and was seen in the night sky for a month until April 13th. A costly project to maintain, the Tribute became an annual, one night display on September 11, 2002. Many New Yorkers are of the opinion that Tribute should become a per- manent part of the official memorial. 45. Ghosting is a continuing ephemeral phenomenon of September 11th. In the 2001 memorials, tokens chosen for display - boots, hats, baseball gloves and other personal effects - were ghosted by implication of their former use by the dead. Of course, the absent Towers will always ghost the sky where they once stood. On a lesser scale, there are other absent landscape features of downtown Manhattan, as well as the absence of those who ónce lived and worked there, but having survived chose to flee the city, determined never to return again to the site of trauma. Only two major ghost artifacts of the disaster remain in situ at Ground Zero: a portion of a concrete stairway down which hundreds fled in their escape from the North Tower, and the remains of the Deutsche Bank Building, covered in black netting, filled with debris and recently discovered frag- ments of human remains. 46. To mark the fifth anniversary of September 11th, I curated a photogra- phy exhibition, presented by the Brooklyn Arts Council, called "Here Was New York: Memorial Images of the Twin Towers." Shown in eleven Brooklyn galleries from September 7 to September 30, 2006, the exhibi- tion, consisting of 350 photographic images taken by 175 participating photographers, paid homage and served as counterpoint to "Here Is New York," a photo exhibition (titled as a play on E.B. White's famous essay in praise of the city) organized by Alice Rose George, Gilles Peress, Michael Shulan, and Charles Traub that opened immediately after the attacks in 2001. Held in a makeshift gallery in Soho, that remarkable project made it possible for anyone to hang their photos recording the events of September 11th. Hundreds did so, and thousands came to see the pictures. Acting upon the same democratic principles as its predecessor, "Here Was New York" invited anyone to submit photo documentation of the Twin Towers as they remain visible in symbolic form throughout</page><page sequence="44">198 KAY TURNER the New York metropolitan area. Recording acts of informal and ephem- eral remembrance that recurrently appear within our communities, the photos depict the Towers in vernacular expressions such as wall murals, shrines, custom painting on trucks, logos, graffiti, tattoos, merchandise display, window stickers, and more. The inaugural exhibition of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, 9/11 and the American Landscape, held in New York September 8 to October 7, 2006, featured the photographs of Jonathan Hyman, who traveled the five boroughs and other parts of the U.S. documenting September 11th tributes, primarily murals, some of which featured the Towers; see Hyman (2006). 47. Especially in the first two years after the attacks New Yorkers - victims' families, downtown residents, artists, and everyday citizens - struggled with issues pertaining to the "ownership" of Ground Zero. Some were concerned with how the site should look and feel in the years it would take to clean, refurbish, and rebuild. In 2002, as the first anniversary approached, Mary Miss, an artist well known for her site specific installa- tions, who also lives near Ground Zero, put out a call to artists and design- ers to create temporary memorials throughout the city saying, "The most touching site after September 11th was to see the flowers and candles in clusters appear throughout the city. Having attending [sic] numerous meetings concerning the temporary and future memorials to the victims ... we feel this is an important precedent which should be looked at very closely. Listening to the various groups and points of view it has become apparent that no singular memorial can address the multiple needs, desires and agendas that are surfacing. ... A diversity of temporary memorials will give us a chance to explore different ideas about creating places of memory." Also in 2002, Miss proposed an ephemeral installa- tion called "Moving Perimeter: A Wreath for Ground Zero," which would utilize flowers in an outline of the boundaries of Ground Zero. The work was only partially completed. 48. See Tandeciarz (2007) for her study of how ordinary citizens in Buenos Aires are continually shaping the evolution of various memorials, both official and vernacular, that instill remembrance of victims of the regime of terror in Argentina in the late 1970s and 1980s. Ephemeral means - graffiti, paper constructions, actions, performances - are central to creat- ing a level of urban tension that keeps memory alive. Refer also to various struggles, one ongoing at the African Burial Ground only a few blocks east of Ground Zero, to create sacred ground at burial sites of African slaves in the Americas and victims of apartheid in Africa. See Perry (1996) and Grunebaum (2007). The cultural politics of Indian reburial is addressed in Yellow Bird and Milun (1994). See also Boyer (1994), Young (2000), and Taylor (2003). 49.

Munoz uses the term "disidentification" to capture a strategy for dealing with dominant ideologies that chooses neither to oppose nor assimilate them. See Munoz for full treatment of the concept in his Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics (1999). 51. I welcome comments on dating the first evidence of spontaneous shrines in the United States and elsewhere. On John Lennon's death, see Haberman (1980) and Coleman (1992). 52. See Thomas (2006: 19-22) for her efforts to distinguish a subset of spon- taneous shrines she refers to as "graveside shrines." 53. Useful sources on the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial include Bodnar (1994); Lin, et al. (n.d.); Sturken (1997); Hass (1998); Lin (2000); and Simpson (2006). 54. Rayner notes the difference between conventional war monuments and new forms such as Lin's and Michael Arad's yet-to-be-built September 11th memorial in New York, "Reflecting Absence." The statuary monu- ment relies upon what she calls the "intelligibility of realism," creating a "datum of historical knowledge" that can easily be forgotten. Such monu- ments soon become empty signifiers. But Arad, in his use of reflecting pools and empty spaces, proposes a place at Ground Zero that will "give space to the trauma by a repetition of loss." His use of elemental, abstract features will provide a space for meditation on loss itself, "memorializing] the unthinkable" and the deaths of individuals occurring as a result (Rayner 2006: 34-35). Arad's memorial, like Lin's, trades on abstraction over realism but if Lin's Vietnam memorial is any indication, "Reflecting Absence" will be filled with memorial ephemera left by millions of visitors in years to come. Yet no plans exist of which I am aware for incorporat- ing the exigencies of these tributes. Our esteemed politicians, developers, architects, designers, and museum directors should take heed of these questions posed by Harriet Senie: "[A]ll spontaneous memorials are democracy in action and as such they suggest a range of critical ques- tions. . . . How can memorial designers tap into the profound personal response and civic commentary evidenced by the practice of spontaneous memorials? . . . Can we create permanent memorials that actively engage a society so clearly in need of them?" (2006: 51). 55. Quoted from a lecture delivered by Paul Morris in Spring 2002, part of a series of public lectures sponsored by the Lower Manhattan Development Council (LMDC) to stimulate discussion and public opinion in the early stages of planning for the memorial at Ground Zero. 56. A growing body of scholarship on monuments and memory makes clear that in the late twentieth century, the Western world entered a new phase of public discourse and practice concerning the meaning and social usefulness of monuments and memory sites. See Young (1993); Sturken (1997); Hass (1998); Levinson (1998); Norkunas (2002); Nelson and Olin (2003); and Simpson (2006).</page><page sequence="46">200 KAY TURNER 57.

My clip file on "makeshift memorial" photos seen in the New York Times over the past ten years marks a certain shift in documentary perspective over the years: a move away from close-ups of the memorials themselves to longer shots which include people viewing or participating in main- tenance of the shrine. See also Santino for his suggestive comment that because media coverage of tragic death includes the memorials, "the media helps spread the tradition" on a global scale (2006c: 10). 64. On memorial walls see Cooper and Sciorra (1994) and Zeitlin and Harlow (2001a). 65. A number of writers in Santino (2006a) address the populist and demo- cratic nature of the spontaneous shrine practice. See, for example, Owens (2006); Santino (2006c); Senie (2006); Thomas (2006); Westgaard (2006); Yocom (2006); and Zeitlin (2006). 66. According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (1961), vigil, in its tradi- tional usage, refers to "the watch kept on the eve of a feast." It is the act of staying awake when sleep is preferred and it has come to mean more generally "devotional watching." WORKS CITED Abrahams, Roger. 1981. The Complex Relations of Simple Forms.
