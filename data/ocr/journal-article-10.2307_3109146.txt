<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personal Selection Nam June Paik: Technology Jacquelyn D. Serwer My early art history training in the late 1960s was largely in the formalist tradition. Abstract Expressionism, Color Field, Minimalism-elegant, pure, pristine art for art's sake, unencumbered by machines or notions of the ephemeral, defined my comfortable frame of reference. I was aware of the Happenings, the "Nine Evenings" at the New York Armory, the work of John Cage and Merce Cunningham, and the pioneering efforts of Nam June Paik, but I viewed all of that as peripheral to my touchstones: contemporary art of Manhattan's uptown galleries. My tastes and interests began to expand when I joined the staff of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), the group in large part responsible for the Happenings and for the art-technology show at the Brooklyn Museum.' Coming into daily contact with scientists and engineers who molded their magic to realize the imaginative fantasies of their artist-collaborators developed my appreciation for the possibilities suggested by more unconventional art media. My fascination increased with E.A.T.'s collaborative project for the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka, Japan. It brought together scientists from California's Jet Propulsion Labora- tory, sound engineers, kinetic sculptors, and performance and video artists. The spectacu- lar effects and the dynamic quality of the pavilion as a whole, as well as the individual elements-the moving sculptures, the artificially generated fog, the reflective properties of the mylar dome-proved to be a mesmerizing combination.2 I became a convert. The seemingly oxymoronic relationship between art and technology now made perfect sense. Subsequent experiences in graduate school and in various museum and teaching positions did not provide me with much opportunity for explorations in the art and technology sphere until recently, when I learned that a major Nam June Paik sculpture might become available to the National Museum of American Art, where I am a curator. Since we view ourselves as responsible for a rather traditional museum with permanence and posterity ever uppermost in mind, I was afraid the piece might seem too quirky or ephemeral for our collection and for the Smithsonian's collective taste. I was relieved when I discovered the prospective sculpture was Technology, the only still-available sculpture out of a group of thirteen called the Cathedralseries. Paik retained this one for himself. The other twelve went to a corporate collector in Korea. When I saw Technology for the first time-in a warehouse in New York-it seemed to pull Paik's entire career together for me. He is the uncontested father of video art, so the television sets had to be there, twenty-five in all, installed inside a slick, shiny cabinet 87 American Art</page><page sequence="2">according to a grid. Though no sound emanated from the monitors, the complex sequence of vibrant color images flashing in counterpoint to one another on the various monitor screens immediately brought to mind Paik's original career as an avant-garde musician and com- poser.3 From music he moved to what we would now call performance art, participating in the multimedia antics of the Fluxus group, where art and life became interchangeable. Paik began to use his TVs not just as a vehicle to transmit sound and images, but as actual compo- sitional elements. One of the most famous of these early works featured the cellist Charlotte Moorman in a piece called TVBra for Living Sculpture (1969). But in Technology, the improvisational is replaced by the permanent. After Fluxus, Paik had done-and continues to do-mammoth site-specific pieces such as the one commis- sioned by the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City (Video-Wall, 1992). Technology displays a presence similar to the larger works but is entirely self-contained, housed in its own steel-covered plywood and aluminum console. And though it lacks the precariousness of some of Paik's discrete pieces and the humor of Jean Tinguely's zany kinetic sculptures of the fifties and sixties, it retains certain Relationships between East and West, past and present, seriousness and whimsy show Paik maintaining his Zen-like equilibrium. touches of Paikian whimsy. Among the variety of tubes, pipes, and hoses along the outside walls and perimeter of the sculpture is a hand-painted hose covered with exuberant Abstract Expressionist color and brushstrokes. His amalgam of East and West comes through as well. Because he grew up in Korea during the Japanese occupation, studied in Japan, Hong Kong, and Germany, and ultimately made his career largely in New York, Paik knows something about crossing cultures. His series of Buddha sculptures and his recent collaboration with Hans Haacke in the prize-winning German Pavilion at the 1993 Venice Biennale are obvious testimo- nies to this well-developed talent. In Technology, nonfunctioning Korean circuit-breakers and cathedral spires are combined with laser-disc images that make references to subjects from around the world. Among the gadgets and nonfunctional conceits that embellish Technology's gothic-inspired forms, a discarded control box conceals a miniature Siva. Medieval Christian forms and the Hindu diety associated with both destruction and renewal have become part of the same Paikian system. Paik's juxtaposition of past and present, like his pairing of East and West, gives Tech- nology a kind of cosmic resonance. The gothic-inspired arches and spires at the top of the piece recall simultaneously medieval architecture and space exploration-heavenly concerns in either case. The sequence of images-three laser-disc recorders each have the images programmed in a different order-also tend to suggest linkages between then and now. Flashes of Albert Einstein, outdated armored vehicles, the Wright Brothers' airplane, South Pacific artworks, West African masks, apocalyptic fires, and computer chips provide a whirlwind journey backwards and forwards through civilization's highs and lows. Given Technology's repertory of images making references both to history and to the present, it serves as a kind of kaleidoscopic memory bank for the future. Coming from music, Paik has often made the passage of time and the accompanying idea of time's transformations a part of his art. In Technology, one has the sensation of experiencing visual and mental leaps as the sequence of pictures are taken in at the tempo fixed by their composer. The unfolding of the images over time provides the viewer with the opportu- nity for more intellectual engagement, allowing for a kind of episodic drama that would be absent from a more static piece. Just as the sequence of images has been carefully orchestrated for intellectual effect, so too have the color juxtapositions and contrasts been 88 Spring 1994</page><page sequence="3">Nam June Paik, Technology, 1991.

Relationships between East and West, past and present, seriousness and whimsy show Paik maintaining his Zen-like equilibrium. Although Technology represents a world in itself, Paik also conceived of it as part of the Cathedral series of thirteen works. Each of the thirteen pieces is dedicated to one complex area of modern civilization. Joining Technology are Agriculture, Art, Autobiography, Com- munication, Economics, Education, Environment, Medicine, Nationalism, Population, Religion, and Transportation. All focus on both the positive and negative developments defining life in the twentieth century. Paik has also subtitled this series My Faust, a reference to the German medieval legend about a magician whose ambitions lead him into a partnership with the devil. The dual nature of technological developments-the trade-offs, compromises and tragedies that have come with progress, like the dark side of Faust's bargain-are all part of the message communicated by this piece. Technology alludes to the complexity of the contemporary human dilemma in which the boundaries between good and evil are sometimes difficult to distinguish. The notion of magic involved in the Faustian story is especially central to Technology. While the magic of the past concerned "Since I have a very clumsy hand and a very anti-machine mentality, I struggle to create something that is related to the machine. I end up creating something unforeseen." -Nam June Paik the supernatural, the magic of the present, as this piece so clearly demonstrates, comes out of science and technology. Sometimes called the "video visionary,"4 Paik has demonstrated through his innova- tions and predictions an uncanny intuition about the future of technology and its more imaginative and benign applications. In 1964 Paik was already experimenting with ways to manipulate the TV image-a process computers have now enabled the contemporary world to readily take for granted. The following year, Paik began to work with one of the earliest portable video cameras and soon after held his premiere exhibition of video art.5 Paik's early recognition of the possibilities of cable television offers further evidence of his grasp of technological trends. The current prominence and ubiquitousness of cable television was unimaginable to most people when Paik described its coming almost two decades ago. During this same period in the 1960s, Paik's first anthropomorphic robot made its debut. Called K-456,6 it was the beginning of several generations of these creatures known collectively as the Family ofRobot. Like Paik, K-456 became a world traveler, participat- ing in events in Berlin, Stockholm, and London. Its most famous appearance took place in New York City in 1982 when it was hit by a car in a staged encounter on Madison Avenue, near the Whitney Museum, where Paik was being honored with a retrospective exhibition.7 Paik continues to make new additions to his "family," as robots have become commonplace in industry as well as in movies of the post-Star Wars generation. Unlike engineers, who, Paik says, "really don't know the capacity of machines" when they invent them, he describes himself as having "been rather successful finding a new combination of machine and man."8 This holds true not only for the robots, but for Paik's approach to all of his work. Given the technological component of Paik's sculptures, one would imagine him as some sort of space-age wizard. He views himself differently. Recently, he spoke of the disparity between the public's image and the reality: "Since I make machine-based art, everybody thinks I am a machine freak. I don't drive a car. I'm a very clumsy guy. And 90 Spring 1994</page><page sequence="5">although I like music, I can barely play an LP or a CD player. But since I have a very clumsy hand and a very anti-machine mentality, I struggle to create something that is related to the machine. I end up creating something unforeseen; maybe that is the secret of my 'success.' "9 While Technology represents in some ways the quintessential Paik, its permanent, object-like quality sets it apart from many of his other pieces that are either site-specific or composites of disparate elements. Here all the parts are neatly incorporated into a single unit, a monolith housing twenty-five ten-inch Quasar color TV monitors all operating in concert. Neat and substantial, it shows Paik's genius for treating us to unexpected and unanticipated relationships. Who else would use a quatrefoil window to frame a TV set? Neither assemblage nor a surrealist work, the combination constitutes a new invention, an autonomous entity that can be viewed as a kind of microcosmic, technicolor summary of our civilization in both its glory and its ambivalence. As Paik put it, "One must know technology very well in order to be able to overcome it."lo Few in the art world would dispute his understanding or the way in which he has turned it into an aesthetic triumph. Technology is our very own testimony to this triumph. Notes 1 "Some More Beginnings" was the name of the exhibition of submitted works involving technical materials and processes organized by staff and members of Experiments in Art and Technology in collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in 1968. 2 See Billy Kluver, Pavilion (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1972). 3 Paik focused on Arnold Schoenberg and his twelve-tone system in studies at the University of Tokyo. Later, he became a disciple of John Cage, whose work, philosophy, and encouragement have been major factors in shaping his career. 4 See Calvin Tompkins, "Profiles: Video Visionary," New Yorker 51 (5 May 1975): 44-79. 5 Called "Electronic Art," it took place at the Galeria Bonino, New York, in 1965. 6 According to Wulf Herzogenrath, the name K-456 refers to "the Kochel-Verzeichnis [Ludwig K6chel catalogue] of the works of Mozart, in which K-456 designates a relatively unknown piano concerto."
