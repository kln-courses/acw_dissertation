<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Toxic Body Politic: Ethnicity, Gender, and Corrective Eco-Justice in Ruth Ozekf s My Year of Meats and Judith Helfand and Daniel Gold's Blue Vinyl Cheryl J. Fish City University of New York It is the winter of discontent for Jane Takagi-Little, the protagonist of Ruth L. Ozeki's novel My Year of Meats (1998). Operation Desert Storm is raging in the Middle East, and she is an unemployed documentary filmmaker of mixed Japanese and Caucasian descent living in New York City's East Village. A call comes in the night, and Jane, who defines her self as an opportunist and idealist, jumps at the chance to work on My American Wife, a weekly television series sponsored by the Beef Export and Trade Syndicate (BEEF-EX) geared toward Japanese housewives. This national lobby uses the show to market meat from the US to Japanese consumers who, until recent westernization, ate mostly rice and fish. With the advent of global capital, the lure of the "all-American" wife and her family preparing and eating "nourishing" meats signifies "wholesome values," according to a tongue-in-cheek memo Jane writes to clarify the show's purpose in her role as "cultural pimp" (9) or mediator between American and Japanese misconceptions of each other. The paradox is, as Jane explains, "the average Japanese wife finds a middle- to upper-middle class white American woman with two to three children to be both suffi ciently exotic and yet reassuringly familiar" (13). But something is rotten in this equation. In fact, this novel shows how the failure to make connections between consuming and desiring, whether it is the food we eat or the ethnic and racial images we exoticize, is dangerously na?ve. Ozeki makes this connec tion by illuminating a direct and insidious relationship between meat pro duction and environmental and public health issues, especially for women, children, persons of color, and the poor.1 Ozeki links corrupt market forces to the destructive deployment of stereotypes and power relations based on gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and nationality. In My Year of Meats, Jane narrates her "accidental" and yet uncanny discovery of the widespread use and dangers of hormones such as DES (diethylstilbestrol), which have been easy fixes for medical doctors, who prescribe it to pregnant women even in the knowledge that it does not prevent miscarriages, and ranchers, who illegally inject it into cattle on feedlots (part of the American factory MELUS, Volume 34, Number 2 (Summer 2009)</page><page sequence="2">44 FISH farming process the novel documents). With pathos and humor, Ozeki's work suggests the importance of environmental justice and ecofeminism as social movements and interrelated critiques that have the power to bring together seemingly disparate individuals in a global economy; the novel also makes a claim for a kind of environmental and social justice citizenship. Moreover, what we consider to be forces of globalization have transcended our sense of local and foreign, as transnational corporations have become "increasingly flagless and stateless, weaving global webs of production, commerce, culture and finance virtually unopposed" (Karliner 178). Yet consumer culture, writes Inderpal Grewal in her discussion of the link between biopolitics and geopolitics within colonial discourses of the US and Europe, "provided the modalities through which national and international belongings could be imagined, and resistant identities rec ognized" (17). What concerns Ozeki, in fact, are the ways in which ethi cal actions are made possible by the "affect" produced (Palumbo-Liu 60, 66) in those who "consume" media content and then engage in embodied coalitional politics. Just as DES exposure motivates Ozeki's protagonist to become a more environmentally conscious television producer, this same chemical also proves to be the toxic rite-of-initiation that prompts Jewish American film maker Judith Helfand and codirector Daniel B. Gold to make the docu mentary film Blue Vinyl (2002), a muckraking account of the discovery of the toxic processes in the manufacturing, consumption, and disposal of a common household product, polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Helfand, a DES daughter who had a hysterectomy at age twenty-five, had worked on George Stoney's documentary The Uprising of 1934, which used oral histories to understand textile strikes in the southern US, merging issues of workers' rights and family health and safety (Helfand, "Connecting" 121). Her first solo documentary, A Healthy Baby Girl (1997), focuses on her surgery and relationship with her mother (who took DES), and draws on Jewish American mother-daughter tensions and reproductive expecta tions, but it also concerns worker health and safety issues as she realizes that "this toxic exposure problem crosses all the borders that we have been taught to honor" (128).2 The link between environmental exposures and epidemiological toxicity continues as Helfand uses what she calls her "uterus money" from her successful lawsuit again Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals to fund Blue Vinyl and to pay for the reconstituted wood that eventually replaces the blue vinyl siding her parents reluctantly agree to remove from their suburban home. Since she plays an active role in her film while Gold stays behind the camera, I shall refer to Helfand as both a narrator and a "character." My Year of Meats and Blue Vinyl draw on gendered ethnic American and</page><page sequence="3">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 45 transnational identities to promote a significant dialogue about conjoining environmental activism and embodied feminist corrective "eco-justice";3 these works show that a critique of racism, sexism, and power relations must be part of the public awareness of exploitative social and environ mental degradation, and that local communities can join with activists, art ists, and experts to make critical media productions that are entertaining and informative. Both works offer alternative strategies, or "environmen tal justice makeovers," with regard to choosing food, household products, and building materials; both also point to how media enables agency but also creates intentional deception. The protagonists use film and television to painstakingly document toxic exposures, seek justice where the health of workers and residents has been compromised, and capture the evidence that industry denies. This essay contributes to environmental justice ecocriticism and criti cal environmental justice studies that engage with coalitional activism, document toxicities, and draw on the power of diverse voices to provoke change through innovative aesthetic representations, as posited by crit ics such as T. V. Reed, Joni Adamson, Lawrence Buell, and Eric Gary Anderson.4 Reed is critical of the overemphasis of pastoral aestheticiza tion in much ecocritcism; he calls for the environmental justice ecocritic to bring forth "the invasive, pervasive effects of corporate capitalism . . . and the racial-class dynamic that has enabled that process to continue" (151). Adamson notes that scholars have called for an environmental jus tice movement "concerned with public policy, but also as a cultural move ment interested in issues of ideology and representation" (1259), while Buell calls for historicizing contemporary-focused eco-justice revisionism in order for "it to become as transformative as it deserves to be" (121). According to Anderson, the ecosocial focuses on "local communities that prepare the way for critical discussion of the blighted, traumatized and traumatic social and cultural histories that play out in built as well as natu ral environments" (195). All these strands inform my analysis here, as does Lee Quinby's genealogical version of ecofeminsm "operating at microlev els where power relations are exercised, yet with a vision for change that is often, though not inevitably, Utopian." Such a feminism illustrates a "coalitional politics that emerges out of the insight that exploitations of land, labor, and women overlap and sustain each other" (42). Critical Environmental Justice Studies and Coalitional Activism In terms of method, novel and film deploy "contextual reasoning" that is often at the center of environmental justice narratives written by women of color?they combine "personal stories and empirical data, to convince</page><page sequence="4">46 FISH others of the connection between pollution and discrimination" (Verchick 67). Ozeki cites bibliographical materials that range from Jeremy Rifkin's Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture (1992) to Cynthia Liatman Orenberg's DES: The Complete Story (1981). Helfand and Gold include data, studies, and interviews with scientists including Dr. Caesar Maltoni, whose 1972 research establishing a link between a rare form of liver cancer and vinyl chloride exposure in mice was repressed by a pact made by an international vinyl manufacturers' group. The film also records Helfand's journey to Venice to document a class-action suit brought by the families of more than one hundred workers of the Enichem Corporation; many of these workers contracted cancer and some died. In Blue Vinyl, Gold and Helfand pursue the intersections of ideology, culture, and activism when it comes to manufacturing and consuming household products to which we initially do not give much thought. They evoke the trauma of a pre-Katrina Louisiana community, Lake Charles, and its surrounding small towns that face environmental, racial, and class divides as residents live on the fenceline with petrochemical plants at their door.5 The film documents how poor communities and those of color are disproportionately affected by toxic facilities in the manufacturing and pro cessing of synthetics and other petroleum-based products. The residents, however, show resilience, setting up bucket brigades to collect air samples outside the PVC plant to seek empirical evidence of toxic releases. When locals work with experienced activists from mainstream organizations or with artists like Helfand and Gold, the results can be powerful and enable a victory or at least a strong challenge to the policies of corporate giants. This film should be added to the body of interdisciplinary work that docu ments the long local and global struggle to resist environmental toxicity in Louisiana's "Cancer Alley" and other towns.6 Residents exposed to toxins in Diamond, Louisiana, next door to Shell Oil's company town of Norco, formed Concerned Citizens of Norco. They were joined by Earth Justice, Refinery Reform Campaign, Louisiana Bucket Brigade, and Greenpeace; these groups pressured Shell to relocate the residents. Margie Richard of Concerned Citizens and Beverly Wright of the Deep South Center reminded everyone that Concerned Citizens should still set the agenda. What their combined actions illustrate, writes Adamson, is that "When race and class tensions arise, honest, direct dialogue across divides of race, power, and privilege are required" (1262-64). These dialogues are skillfully evoked by Helfand and Gold, and other issues emerge in the significant thrust toward the necessity of international environmental justice; other works such as Steve Lerner's Diamond continue to examine the toxically exposed fenceline communities in the US and Africa.</page><page sequence="5">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 47 Otherness as Transcendence and Ironic Dissent In keeping with the idea that ethnicity, race, and social class are signi fies for targeted groups and can offer potentially powerful constituencies built across differences, Ozeki and Helfand illustrate ethnic American cul tural identities that are aesthetically and socially complex when they cross national boundaries. When geopolitical contexts shift and the media are involved, local contexts may be elided and replaced with fantasies of other ness that hold the promise of transcendence, but care must be taken to see who benefits and loses from such projections. Ozeki's second protagonist, Akiko Ueno, the wife of Jane's boss John Ueno, is a traumatized, bulimic Japanese housewife, pushed into an unhappy marriage by cultural expec tations and by her lonely childhood as an orphan raised by a drunken uncle and dour-faced aunt (39). Ironically, Akiko fantasizes about the exoticism of Louisiana as she listens to Cajun and southern funk music discovered on one of Jane Takagi Little's "subversive" episodes ofMy American Wife; this episode features the Beaudroux family, who own a Cajun restaurant. To combat world overpopulation, they have adopted children from various developing countries; as a family that combines hybridity and jouissance, they boost the show's rating. For Akiko, the non-traditional family (with husband Vern cooking instead of his wife), the exotic location, and the music produce a fantasy that enables her to envision alternative options for her own life. Therefore, global production and consumption cannot be separated from lived bodily experiences that might vary in local, specific contexts, but that produce transnational identifications and subjects. As Akiko lis tens to "Hot Tamale Baby," she imagines adopting children instead of cop ing with her dreaded infertility, and she believes the music makes her feel "reckless," which helps empower her (79). Some of Ozeki's characteriza tions seem clich?d or romanticized at times, but other points play effec tively with irony and satire. The Beaudroux family's property is overrun with kudzu, a native Asian plant and "the most infamous exotic to shoot its roots through the thin mantle of American soil" (76). They see it as an invasive weed, while Jane claims it had spread to 500,000 acres of the southeastern US, a metaphor for "the inroads of Japanese industry into the nonunionized South" (77). But Suzuki, one of Jane's crew, shows Vern how to dig up the tubers and use them to thicken sauces and batters?a collaboration that crosses nature and culture, challenging notions of inva sion and ethnic-based blame to form a gumbo that pleases all. Both Blue Vinyl and My Year of Meats show how globalization uses women, technology, minorities, and animals to feed the insatiable mod ern desire to consume and to appropriate otherness for profit and power;</page><page sequence="6">48 FISH both also draw on humor to convey their activist messages. They expose the intersection of environmental degradation that harms animals and humans at the levels of manufacturing, consuming, marketing, and dis posal of materials, emphasizing through narrative, irony, and pastiche the ''commodity chain" that begins with resource extraction and ends with the purchase, use, and disposal of waste in both meat and vinyl production (Princen 15). A good illustration of this connection and its irony is the cover of My Year of Meats, which depicts an oversized pair of chopsticks holding a small but entire black and white cow with a full udder. Despite the sexism they face in the media and elsewhere, Helfand and Ozeki offer female protagonists who are willing to show their fallibility in going up against powerful entities?from their bosses and corporate pub lic relations executives to larger societal forces of greed and global cor porate machines that have enormous money, power, and influence. "Toxic humor" plays a significant role in both works, as it offers a counterpoint to the rhetoric of fear and catastrophe that dominates many environmen tally themed works and points to the roles of play and linguistic slippage that emphasize subversive possibilities. The heroines are tremendously likeable, in part because we can laugh as they perform and poke fun at themselves; viewers identify with their dilemmas, quests for knowledge, and transformative empowerment. For example, Helfand includes a scene in which she works with a coach to help her pick the appropriate outfit to wear as she practices for her confrontation with William F. Carroll, the head of the Vinyl Institute. Imagine Michael Moore hiring someone to assist with his wardrobe and rhetorical style! This difference illustrates the gendered performance of the muckraker and allows us to identify with and laugh at Judith while we also admire her stealth in preparing to ask hard questions in a nonthreatening manner for her few allotted minutes. In My Year of Meats Jane embodies a hybrid biracial androgynous identity, seen as threatening and yet enabling to the subversive agency that challenges stereotyped representations of red meat, patriarchy, and white American superiority: "I am just under six feet.... In Japan this makes me a freak. ... I cut my hair short, dyed chunks of it green, and spoke in men's Japanese. It suited me. Polysexual, polyracial, perverse. . . . Being racially 'half... I was uniquely suited to the niche I was to occupy in the television industry... it seems I was useful... selling off the vast illusion of America to a cramped population on that small string of Pacific islands" (9). This ironic distancing from essentialist American and Japanese stereo types of the heartland?normative, white, heterosexual?enables Jane to rationalize her non-traditional choices for the show, such as working-class African Americans, and the one that gets her fired, a Caucasian and African American lesbian couple with two biracial children. They are vegetarians</page><page sequence="7">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 49 and their research confirms that "cheap meat is an inalienable right in the U.S.A., an integral component of the American dream, and the beef pro ducers looked to cheap DES to provide it." "Today ... 95 percent of feed lot cattle in the U.S. still receive some form of growth-promoting hormone or pharmaceutical in feed supplements" (126). In My Year of Meats, the body, often emphasized as ethnic, gendered, and socioeconomically marked, is the repository of the toxic products of transnational corporate practices: the circulation by agribusiness and fac tory farms of debilitating chemicals and hormones through animals. These practices are rationalized as "making good clean meat for you city folks" by one of the hands on rancher Gale Dunn's feedlot. Dunn uses banned DES to fatten cows for slaughter because he is compromised by market driven policies.7 As Eric Schlosser argues in Fast Food Nation (2001), "Ranchers followed the advice of agribusiness firms and gave their cattle growth hormones." Then, when foul play was suspected, "many were afraid to testify against large meatpacking companies, fearing retaliation and 'economic ruin'" (142-43). Ozeki does not specifically identify corpo rations as forming a new "meat trust" in the way Schlosser historicizes the meat industry in the late-twentieth century (and Upton Sinclair proclaims in The Jungle)', however, she does reveal the complex local, national, and transnational repercussions of the meatpacking industry as it exists today. If ethnic and religious identity emerge from familial and cultural prac tices and contextualize environmental consciousness, either can soon lead to a transethnic form of ecological citizenship and sustainability. In Blue Vinyl, Gold and Helfand open with informal shots of Helfand's parents in front of their Merrick, Long Island home, with its rotting wood stripped off as workers prepare to replace it with the seemingly benign blue vinyl siding. It turns out to be part of a toxic chain that challenges the notion of the home as haven; a hint is given as Florence, Judith's mother, is "disgust edly muttering 'farkrokhn,' her Yiddish for rotten" (Plevin 226). She also connects the decay of the wood to Judith's painful experience with DES exposure and cervical cancer; it becomes the backdrop for an exploration of how the place where one lives, the materials and materiality of the home, become part of the dweller's body and the body politic, a habitus or locus manifesting as "a dialectic of the internalization of externality and the externalization of internality" (Bourdieu, qtd. in Young xvii). Also, for Jews the recognition of one's historical past, as well as how memory con tinues to shape Jewish and Jewish American identity, plays an important role (Plascow 414); this concept seems implicit in Helfand's ethic. Jewish wisdom and the history of those who have been involved in the civil rights struggles and other coalitional social justice politics is implicated through the use of a Yiddish proverb that has both a Jewish and universal</page><page sequence="8">50 FISH application. "There's an old Yiddish saying," Helfand's voiceover states. "If your neighbor's house is on fire, you're not safe. So if Mossville and Lake Charles (Louisiana) are in trouble, so are we." Throughout the film this metaphor illustrates the unmediated border crossings of toxins, poli cies, and lifestyle choices. The opening scenes also set up a comparison between Helfand's family and the less privileged people in the film. Her middle-class family has the luxury of contemplating what material that is both environmentally sustainable and inoffensive to their suburban com munity would provide an alternative to the vinyl siding, while an African American family displaced by poison water from the polyvinyl chloride plant outside Lake Charles cannot sell their house. We see them move the humble shelter onto a truck to relocate it in another town. According to Dorceta E. Taylor and others, this type of move?relocating and swear ing to remain silent about their experience?has occurred in other African American communities in Louisiana where corporations have located, assuming that they can take advantage of low-income populations of color (44). Soon, we see Helfand celebrating local traditions by wearing her Mardi Gras crown and festive beads as she visits Lake Charles during its party, all the while carrying her talismanic piece of vinyl siding. This piece of siding is a transitional object, maintaining the flow and focus of her subject, gently reminding viewers how the material is used in numerous consumer items such as toys, credit cards, cell phones, and IV bags?and is already connected to the global concerns of workers and to questions not only of use, but of ref-use. It may also stand metonymically for Helfand's missing uterus, the part of herself identified in A Healthy Baby Girl as a loss that makes her rethink traditional definitions of female/feminine bodies and sexuality and any desire she may have to create a family in the future as is expected of the traditional Jewish woman. The piece of vinyl is also a source of humor for viewers. Arlene Plevin argues it "functions as a kind of comedie ventriloquist's dummy, silently speaking for the presence of suburbia. . . . The piece of siding is disruptive .... Helfand and her blue vinyl become a kind of Laurel and Hardy team" (236). This ironic incon gruity situates us early in the film and shifts us continually between middle class white Jewish subjects, working-class white, African American, other American, and European victims of toxic exposure. For instance, scenes of carnival celebration are juxtaposed with insidious background shots of fumes spewing from smoke stacks as African American children swim in the tainted water and couples dance to lively Cajun music along the fence line of the polyvinyl plants. It is funny, but at whose expense? In this sense, humor is a form of both relief and reflection for Helfand's persona and for the viewer, just as in the Jewish tradition, humor and irony have long been</page><page sequence="9">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 51 survival tactics in the face of persecution and outsider status. This tension makes us take notice, it makes us uncomfortable, and hopefully it makes us feel that we must take some action to thwart the status quo. Malignancy and Consciousness: Ecocritical, Ecofeminist Truths Now I shift to Ozeki's engagement with the intersections between exploitative agricultural and farming practices in the US and the racial and ethnic stereotyping that is part of the same status quo. Ozeki, who adds her voice to the emerging canon of biracial and bicultural Asian American writers,8 has worked as a documentary filmmaker and continues to be heavily influenced by this gerne. Through the process of documenting and presenting multiple layers of evidence?even as her protagonist Jane is skeptical about the distinctions between reality and one's perception of it?truth might be exposed, because "truth lies in layers, each of them thin and barely opaque" (175). In Ozeki's hands, the layers include faxes, journal entries, "documentary interludes," Jane's shocking footage of a five-year-old girl who is prematurely developed as a result of hormone poisoning, and scenes from a working slaughterhouse. The characters represent different races, classes, cultures, sexual preferences, and inter ests. In Ozeki's world, these identities are presented as various versions of Donna Haraway's situated knowledges, each coming from a place of the embodied partial that uncovers the lies and absurdities of various indi vidual and corporate interests. Ozeki was born in the US and mined the multiple meanings of her Japanese ancestry in the documentary Halving the Bones, which explores three generations of Japanese American women on her mother's side of the family. In this film, Ozeki's mother's tumor "is evoked by Ruth to understand how race is constructed as malignancy? but a malignancy generative of ironic consciousness" (Zyrd 122). Growing up in rural Minnesota as the daughter of a Nordic American father and a Japanese mother, Jane shares this ironic consciousness. As a documentarian-turned-novelist, Ozeki brings a consciousness of the com promise and the shadow/act involved in representing "reality" in a market that thrives on pigeon-holing and manipulation. She draws on the 1991 Gulf War and its exploding oil fields, large-scale bombings, and "video game" erasure of bodies as a background soundtrack for the novel's open ing, in which the Japanese crew directs a kiss between American wife Suzie Flowers and her cheating husband. The "as-seen-on-TV" version replaces his infidelity (which had been revealed to Suzie during the film ing) with the family tensely dining on Coca-Cola rump roast. This recipe, which combines Coca-Cola and meat, or "rumpu rossuto" as Japanese housewife Akiko Ueno calls it, gives readers a taste of Ozeki's talent for</page><page sequence="10">52 FISH blending brand name essence, linguistic pidgins, and oxymoronic conceits. The recipes (such as beef fudge and Hallelujah lamb chops) and the twisted cruelty of American mall culture combine kitsch with the grotesque. Some may laugh at this humor, but none of it proves harmless, for it exhibits a lack of respect for women, minorities, and animals; it also feeds the casual and pathological acceptance of violence, sexual objectification, and the deadening of empathy. For instance, members of Jane's Japanese crew get drunk on Jack Daniels and shoot out the breasts and crotches of Hustler pinups with air guns they buy from Wal-Mart, embracing the seemingly innocuous trash culture. While Ozeki never refers directly to the Japanese American experience of internment in US camps during World War II, she evokes the suspicion of certain elements of American culture: "guns, race, meat, and Manifest Destiny" (89). She notes the case of Yoshihiro Hattori, a sixteen-year-old who was shot to death in Louisiana when he rang the doorbell of Rodney Dwayne Peairs to ask for directions. Peairs, a butcher at Winn Dixie, was acquitted of manslaughter on the grounds that he had acted reasonably to defend his home (88). If Jane epitomizes a mobile feminist American activist of mixed-race parentage who embraces Western multiculturalism, Akiko, the wife of Jane's boss, BEEF-EX marketing executive Joichi (John) Ueno (Wayno), is her Japanese alter ego. Introverted, isolated, and confined in her role as consumer and evaluator of each episode of My American Wife, Akiko is expected to be the compliant housewife who tests cheerfully each of the American wives' meat recipes and produces a male heir for the unbearable Ueno. Unknown to each other, but linked through shifting narrative sec tions told from each one's point of view, both Akiko and Jane are "sick," experiencing their bodies as deformed in the so-called "female" arenas. Akiko is bulimic. Before her misguided marriage to Ueno, she had taken pleasure in her job at a manga publishing house, writing copy for comic books and studying classics. Jane is a DES daughter with a misshapen uterus, probable infertility, and possible cancer as a result of hormone treatments given to her mother in the hope of preventing miscarriage. Both Akiko and Jane have an inkling that patriarchal power structures, market forces, and the infantilization of women are at the heart of their maladies; both take refuge in The Pillow Book of Sei Sh?nagon, the ur-text of this novel. As Jane explains, Sh?nagon was a great Japanese female documentar?an. At the end of the first millennium, Sh?nagon dabbled "in the male tongue" by using Chinese characters to write her descriptions of her life and her lovers (15). She inspires Jane to become a documentar ?an and have an adventurous on-the-road love affair with the musician Sloan Rankin. For Akiko, reading Sh?nagon and keeping her own pillow book is a way to document her pain and express her submerged creativity,</page><page sequence="11">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 53 which she must hide from John as she hides her bulimic vomiting and the cessation of her menstrual period. While the historical and metaphorical link with Sh?nagon is quite satisfying, it is, unfortunately, one of the few positive examples of Japanese culture in a novel that includes orientalist images of Asian characters even as it problematizes such representations.9 Ozeki splits her characters in a way that polarizes national and gendered stereotypes. Akiko emerges out of her shell once she escapes her husband and her country, finding refuge in liberal Northampton, Massachusetts. Pregnant, she becomes an essentialized "earth mother" with a mystical ability to see, feel, and know every stage of her unborn baby's growth. Toxic Humor and the Ecofeminist Expos? The conflicts Jane faces as an Asian American woman director in a tradi tionally white, male profession become central to her emerging embrace of environmental justice and an intuitive kind of ecofeminism. She illustrates how poor and minority populations are often exposed to additional toxins. For instance, Mr. Purcell, an African American man from a working-class southern family, has received hormone poisoning from eating too many cheap chicken necks: "It was some medicines they was usin' in the chickens that got into the necks we was eatin'_An that medicine, well if it didn't start to make me sound just like a woman!" he says (117). As she discovers gross abuses committed in the raising and slaughtering of cattle and their widespread repercussions, her ethics of accountability in a public space take on increasing importance. The drive to expose corruption based on dichotomous and deceptively simplified forms of hierarchy?humans over animals, men over women, adults over children, whites over non whites, making money over doing ethical work?exhibits the ecofeminist and environmental justice rejection of nature/culture dualisms, the impact of "development," and the repercussions of exploitative labor (Gaard 6). As Richard Hofrichter argues in the introduction to Toxic Struggles: The Theory and Practice of Environmental Justice, "women, especially those whose health and survival have always been particularly affected by eco logical deterioration because of gender inequalities, are rapidly becom ing more politicized every year" (3). Jane's politicization illustrates the importance of a female agency that can no longer afford to let differences surrounding social class, race, work, and sexuality define them as people and keep them isolated from the forces that harm them. Shameem Black claims this novel "forges a cosmopolitan feminism in resistance to the individual, patriarchal, and corporate agents that endanger women's bod ies and attack their sexuality worldwide" (230), yet women outside the cosmopolitan mode are also part of this alliance, and children are often</page><page sequence="12">54 FISH the victims of toxic exposure. Jane's ecofeminist/environmental justice critique is the catalyst that moves former Texas rodeo queen and stripper Bunny Dunn, who had been covering up her daughter's hormonal poison ing, to confess to Jane and allow her to film the grotesquely overdeveloped body of her sleeping five-year-old. The girl's condition is a result of hor mone poisoning from exposure to illegal chemicals on the feedlot. Jane creates an informal community of informed "agents" comprised of some of the wives on the show, the victims of environmental exposures, and other activists or individuals willing to take on the system. She conducts "fieldwork" by listening to Americans from various geographical, ethnic, and social locations as she scouts out locations and women for the televi sion series. When she discovers that Ueno raped and abused Akiko, Jane uses faxes to help Akiko figure out how to escape. Once Jane is empow ered with knowledge of hormonal and chemical exposure, she decides where to point the camera and how to document her findings, transform ing the phallic gun of Western law and order into a biracial, postmodern, ecofeminist expos?. The most unabashedly evil character in the novel is Ueno, who in his embrace of American "might" takes to calling himself John Wayno. As a violent, racist, sexist Japanese man who uncritically believes in the supe riority of meat and of American "vigor," he is the novel's major beef.10 Ozeki might have done more to link Ueno's need to dominate and pun ish women to the relations between constructions of masculinity, access to power, blindness to environmental and ethical violations, and national identity; a Japanese man who works and travels frequently in the US might provide instructive exploration of how anti-Asian sentiment and the feminization of Japanese males could contribute to his internalized self representations (Ma xiii). Instead, Ozeki claims Ueno is merely caught "between American bosses, Japanese corporate culture and two highly sub versive women" ("Conversation" 11). Helfand and Gold also show how environmentalists must seek out and incorporate local knowledge as well as connect with grassroots activists, policy makers, and legal experts as a counterpoint to corporate propaganda and secrecy. Mr. Hardy, an elderly African American man who lives close to the polyvinyl chloride plant in Lake Charles, does not need to take the tour offered by factory management to show their so-called good will and deny the severity of toxic exposure. "I've lived here for thirty-five years. I know what goes on," he remarks at a public meeting Helfand attends. Diane Prince, a Mossville-Lake Charles resident and cancer patient, remarks that she knows in her body what is difficult if not impossible to prove: that her home's location outside the plant has been a factor in her illness. The bucket brigade collects air samples for testing, despite being</page><page sequence="13">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 55 threatened by security guards. Helfand introduces lawyer Billy Baggett, whose archive is described as "the most extensive collections of internal chemical industry documents anywhere" (qtd. in Plevin, 235); he has been representing workers for ten years in toxic tort suits that will not come to trial. The film shows that, on the rare occasions he is allowed inside the PVC plant, Baggett brings a homemade tripod?his version of Foucault 's panopticon?that holds multiple video cameras in order to document as much as he can. Like Ozeki, Helfand is one of the new muckrakers who create a "lit erature of exposure" (Tichi 70), making transparent the role of visual documentation in establishing proof when the burden rests on the victim; however, without legal and policy reform this will not create more cor porate accountability or environmental and worker protection. Ozeki and Helfand also understand that workers may be conflicted between the need to have a job and the desire to be safe. I Need This Job: Diverse Bodies and More Sustainable Futures Ozeki makes a point about such a conflict by having Jane Takagi Little engage in collective bargaining with herself. Jane realizes her complicity as an agent of the media that generally fails to comprehend connec tions made in environmental justice theory between civil rights, housing, employment, the quality of urban life, and policies of global corporations (Hofrichter 6). "I need this job," Jane writes; "On the other hand, I can't continue making the kind of programs Ueno wants" (210). Jane is in a position of relative privilege; one gets the feeling she could easily find another job, unlike the many workers in the meatpacking plants who have few options. They are mostly Mexican, Central American, and Southeast Asian immigrants, and some are illegal; they work in "the most danger ous job in the United States. . . . Every year more than one quarter of the meatpacking workers ... roughly forty-three thousand men and women? suffer an injury or a work-related illness" (Schlosser 172). My Year of Meats does not cover the geopolitics of meat processing or the history of how the giant packers consolidated through mergers during the Reagan 1980s, moving to rural areas in the Midwest and West that were tradition ally resistant to unions. Her novel, however, exhibits the end result. Jane also writes in her journal: [A] massive rift has occurred between the seat of my so-called intelligence and my dumb, stunned body. With my mind I am studying meat_I am read ing chilling descriptions of the slaughterhouse, the caked filth, blood coursing down the cement kill floor, the death screams of a slaughtered lamb (exactly like the cry of a human baby) going on and on, long after the lamb's throat has</page><page sequence="14">56 FISH been cut. And yet. . . And yet my body still craves the taste and texture of animal between my teeth. (207) The acknowledgement of a rift between Jane's mind and body is power ful, suggesting that her stunned body is like the cattle about to be slaugh tered, but her human consciousness is unable or unwilling to transcend the anthropomorphic view, just as Ueno and Dunn have trouble overcoming their androcentrism. Here, the novel shows that the desire to eat meat is caused by a combination of cultural, intellectual, biological, and habitual conditioning that should be personally confronted. The politics of meat become entangled with Jane's reproductive health and symbolize the vulnerability of workers' and women's bodies. Jane, who believed she was infertile because of her misshapen uterus and failed attempts to conceive with her African American ex-husband, becomes pregnant as a result of an affair with Sloan Rankin. While Akiko is empow ered by her connection to her fetus, Jane refuses to let her vulnerability to miscarriage stop her from entering the slaughterhouse. She ignores advice from both her doctor and her boyfriend and her own desire to "go back to the motel and get perfectly clean and then curl up in cool sheets and hug my belly for the next few months, until it was huge and viable" (265). She leads the crew to the feedlot and the slaughterhouse in order to be account able to justice, to empirical truth, and to the community she has come to know and envision?and perhaps to gratify her ego. This difficulty in tak ing care of one's health and the health of the unborn is faced by factory and migrant workers on a daily basis. While Jane does not acknowledge this difference, her struggle illustrates how public and private are blurred as women face difficult choices in caring for themselves and their fami lies while trying to survive economically in a world that abuses society's resources for profit. Here, what No?l Sturgeon calls the "third position" of ecofeminism offers analytical insights as it connects the relations of women to nature by drawing on historical, cross-cultural, and material analyses of women's work (29). This section of the novel also emphasizes the necessity of taking into account places like meatpacking plants, where workers face human rights violations. Ozeki's description of Jane's foot age of the slaughterhouse echoes that of Schlosser 's and Upton Sinclair's except that the emphasis here is on the evidence of hormones, which fits the novel's recurring motif: Stepping into the slaughterhouse was like walking through an invisible wall into hell.... Steam hissed, metal screeched against metal,... splitting the ear .... Chains, pulleys, iron hooks whipped around us with unbearable speed, and as far as the eye could see, conveyors snaked into the distance, heaped</page><page sequence="15">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 57 with skinned heads and steaming hearts. Overhead a continuous rail system laced the ceiling, from which swung mammoth sides of beef, dripping, and heavy with speed as they rattled toward us. ... I looked into a cart filled with hundreds of livers, spotted with blood and oozing a viscous yellow liquid. Dave .. . pointed to the secretions. "Hormones7" he hollered over the din. (281-82) Jane continues to film this terrifying scenario. Her desire to capture the scene is as strong as her desire to protect herself and her fetus. She is sent sprawling into the path of an oncoming carcass as a gushing stream of blood from an animal's slit throat forces the cameraman to back into her. When Jane later loses the baby, she blames herself for doing the shoot, only to find out the pregnancy had lost viability earlier: "possibly your uterus was too small... possibly the placenta failed" (298). She feels sad dened by the loss and still lives with the fear that she might develop cancer as a result of the DES her mother took in her desperate attempts to have a child. Jane transforms her own "psychic numbing that characterizes the end of the millennium" (334) by spreading the truths she has realized. Her documentary creates a stir in the media in the US, Japan, and elsewhere: "I got a small but critical piece of information about the corruption of meats in America out to the world, possibly even saved a little girl's life in the process. ... I am haunted by . . . big things, little things, Splendid Things and Squalid Things?that threaten to slip through the cracks, untold, out of history" (360). Jane is right to be haunted by history that slips through the cracks or is forgotten in cultural amnesia. Jane comes to realize that truths, which have elements of fiction, can alter outcomes. Through Jane's individual and collective action and her use of image and technology, Ozeki exposes the toxicity chain in factory farming, and tells a story that entertains as well as informs. As a Japanese American woman, Jane illustrates one of the dark sides of the American dream, one that immigrants such as Akiko are bound to embrace, but much more problematically. Ozeki's contribution becomes more signifi cant when we recognize how her hybrid novels deploy questions regarding the intersections of ethnicity, gender, nation, and ecocritical reading. Her work is included in what Sucheta Muzumdar defines as "a new paradigm which contextualizes the history of Asian Americans within the twentieth century global history of imperialism, of colonialism, and of capitalism" (qtd. in Wang 138-39). In the end, Judith Helfand goes back to the cocoon of her suburban Jewish American family home, as she needs to win over her parents regarding the dangers of vinyl, just as she would need to convince the average American that the cheap fix of vinyl siding has a dark underbelly.</page><page sequence="16">58 FISH Her dad is a bit of a hard sell, but after Helfand shows him data and facts about toxic exposure to workers and to some residents near factories and explains the dangers to the family should their house catch on fire, they agree to remove the vinyl siding as long as it is done with respect to their tradition, before the Jewish "high holidays" of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. After investigating a variety of more sustainable housing materi als, Helfand finds that many of the options are too costly for the average American, including the reconstituted wood she ends up buying. Then there is the problem of what to do with the cast-aside vinyl siding, since its disposal proves to be one of slow and toxic decay; she comes up with a clever yet meaningful solution that gestures towards sustainability. She and her parents do piece work, attaching Mardi Gras beads to small pieces of the blue vinyl, which they label with a warning about the dangers: "This is vinyl. Don't Burn It! Throw it Away! [Skull and Crossbone symbol] WARNING: Manufacturing and burning vinyl creates dioxin and other chemicals that can cause cancer and harm fetal development." Helfand also provides her Web site, "myhouseisyourhouse.org." They leave the offerings on their suburban street; they are the first ones on their block to break the silence about vinyl, and they will let others discover and ultimately decide for themselves. Meanwhile, the vinyl industry has set up a Web site called aboutbluevinyl.org, in which it accuses the film of "missfing] the mark on the facts about vinyl manufacturing and use" and alleges that the truth is "that vinyl brings value to life" (Vinyl Institute). Helfand and Gold have continued their activism through their film pro duction company. Recently, they released a film about global warming, Everything s Cool, which documents through personal narrative and a look at the work of various activists the chasm between scientific understand ing and political action regarding climate change. Ozeki and Helfand show us a world where individuals can make a dif ference in the politics of consumption, production, and toxic exposures that harm many communities and make people sick. The two may be grounded in different ethnic histories, but each reaches across cultures to contest the meaning of truth and fiction and to expose harmful ideologi cal and business practices that degrade human and non-human animals as well as natural and built environments. Both works show that the arts? literature, performance, and film?document as well as create part of the web of coalitional movements for social change that cross many borders. My intention is to contribute to an emerging body of critical environmen tal justice scholarship that examines vital work being done by American artists of varying ethnic backgrounds who are sophisticated aestheticians and "funny girls." Ozeki and Helfand show us that the eco-justice expos? goes beyond acknowledging risk and generating fear; it creates an embod</page><page sequence="17">CORRECTIVE ECO-JUSTICE 59 ied and often playful dialogue with economic and social processes that enable alliances, and it paves the way for a complex nexus of resistance, as toxins in our lands impact us differently but affect us all. Notes I wish to thank Joni Adamson, Leslie King, and Lee Quinby for their helpful com ments on earlier versions of this essay. I also thank the members of Neil Smith and Ida Susser's "Transformative Cities" seminar at the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics at the CUNY Graduate Center for creating a stimulating, cross-disci plinary environment in which I was able to expand the scope of this research. 1. Risk assessment shows that certain chemical exposures are likely to damage a woman's immune system and that women may be more susceptible than men to PCBs, dioxin, and other chemicals that accumulate in fatty tissue. See Robert R. M. Verchick's "Feminist Theory and Environmental Justice." 2. Judith Helfand and other DES daughters with whom she annually meets frame their experience with chemicals in a historical and cultural context unfolding over time and in relation to, for instance, Vietnam Vets exposed to another toxin, Agent Orange. 3. Dorceta E. Taylor writes that the environmental justice movement is concerned with distributive justice "as it relates to identifying past injustices and remedial action. It is also concerned with corrective justice because the relationships between citizens and the government, and the relationships between citizens and corporations, can be seen as forms of social transactions (a social contract)" (42). 4.1 have written elsewhere about the importance of entering the critical environ mental justice field by teaching interdisciplinary courses that draw on diverse materials from the humanities, social sciences, and sciences, and I include discus sion of Ozeki's and Helfand's work in that essay. See "Environmental Justice in Literature and Film." 5. According to Steve Lemer, Mossville, a fenceline community outside Lake Charles and one of the towns included in Blue Vinyl, dates back to 1812 and is now "adjacent to the largest complex of PVC plants in the U.S." (176). 6. See, for instance, Steve Lerner's Diamond, Barbara Allen's Uneasy Alchemy, Verchick's "Katrina, Feminism, and Environmental Justice," Yusef Komunyakaa's "Dark Waters," and Spike Lee's film When the Levees Broke. Some centers that focus on environmental injustices in Louisiana and the South include Robert Bullard's Environmental Justice Research Center at Clark Atlanta University and Beverly Wright's Deep South Environmental Justice Center. 7. Gale Dunn epitomizes a man who is compromised by these and other market driven policies; in his attempts to maximize profits, he uses illegal hormones on his feedlots and believes wholeheartedly in "frontier justice" and the objecti fication of animals and women. His office sports a "wood-paneled panopticon decorated with a large poster of a young blond Amazon in jungle bikini" (280), connecting Foucault's symbol of an all-powerful surveillance system with the</page><page sequence="18">60 FISH casual objectification of women. Most tellingly, he fails to grasp the dangerous poisoning that has caused his five-year-old stepsister Rosie Dunn to develop full breasts and pubic hair, as she has been afflicted with premature thelarche caused by inhaling airborne chemicals and ingesting popsicles from his feedlot fridge. In fact, as Jane's film crew astutely notices in freeze-framing their footage, Gale seems to be fondling the little girl's breasts. 8. For another reading of an engagement between environmental justice and eth nic and gendered identities, see Julie Sze. 9. According to an interview with Ozeki, Akiko represents "my little introvert," while Jane "is my extroverted self who has similar "exterior identities and expe riences" with the author ("Conversation" 10). 10. Ueno's toxic masculinity is brought home most powerfully when he attempts to rape Jane one night when he is drunk and, later in the novel, when he rapes and sodomizes Akiko when he learns she has begun to get her periods and has faxed Jane to warn of his attempt to censor an episode of the show that will expose graphic and corrupt practices on cattle feedlots and in slaughterhouses. In fact, the two women are linked throughout the novel: Akiko stands for the Japanese housewife Jane had hoped to reach, one who would be empowered by Jane's multicultural, alterative family, and not-limited-to-beef version of My American Wife. This linkage reveals the potential liberating effects of the media in revising hegemonic ideology. Works Cited Adamson, Joni.
