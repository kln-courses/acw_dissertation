<plain_text><page sequence="1">Don't Call Me a Tree Hugger!: Sticks, Stones, and Stereotypes in Ecocriticism Kevin Hutchings University of Northern British Columbia His enemies have fallen beneath his axe like trees in a forest; and he feels as little remorse as the woodman who fells them. - Mary Shelley I. Tree Hugging on the Cut Block and in the Academy The first time I heard the word "tree hugger" - some twenty years ago - I was employed as a seasonal silviculture worker at a remote logging camp on the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. The unfamiliar epithet had been hurled across the mess-hall by a crusty old logger looking for a fight. Clearly, he had shared his logging camp with me and my fellow tree planters long enough. "Go home you tree-hugging faggots," he yelled amidst a burst of expletives, seemingly oblivious to the fact that only a few of us tree planters were gay, and that we were working to plant the very tree farms that would help to ensure his own profession's future survival. In retrospect, I suppose I can understand at least some of the old guy's disdain - if not his heterosexism. After all, we tree planters were mostly young and rowdy city dwellers and college students, and our unwelcome presence in the sacrosanct spaces of his bunkhouses and mess- hall must have been disruptive. Since that time, I have heard "tree hugger" used often enough and in a di- verse assortment of situations; and I suppose I have become somewhat accus- tomed to the epithet. Nevertheless, I was very much taken aback the first time I experienced its usage in an academic context. During my graduate training a number of years ago, I unexpectedly had what I thought was the good fortune to be seated at a conference luncheon beside a prominent feminist scholar from the literature department of a prestigious American university, someone whose writ- ings I had avidly read and very much admired. To my delight, she graciously asked me what I was currently researching; so I told her about my ecocritical dissertation project. "Oh, you're a tree hugger," she immediately responded, later adding - quite oddly, I thought - "What time do you get up in the morning to hug trees?" 1 was flabbergasted. I confess that I wanted, as a rejoinder, to ask her what time she 5</page><page sequence="2">got up in the morning to hug feminists; but I knew that such a comment would be politically and ethically distasteful - not to mention horribly impolite - so I held my tongue. Because 1 had recently become acquainted with ecofeminist philosophy, which posits a complex correlation between the domination of women and the exploitation of nature in androcentric society, I was all the more perplexed by her seeming readiness to reject ecological activism out of hand.1 But in the end, nothing I could say in rational defense of my research was able to convince this remarkable scholar that my intellectual project was worth pursuing, leaving me to wonder whether my case had been lost a priori, before the discussion had even begun. Subsequently, 1 encountered this scholar at two other international conferences, and at both events she seemed to enjoy baiting me by calling me a tree hugger. Curiously, the way she abruptly dismissed my research called to mind the old logger who attempted verbally to dismiss me from his logging camp so many years before. To a certain extent, I write this essay as part of an effort to understand the common ground seemingly shared by this privileged feminist academic and her homophobic working-class counter- part. How, I've often asked myself, has the derogatory term "tree hugger" found currency in the vocabulary of people inhabiting such seemingly divergent social and cultural spheres? A few subsequent experiences have shown me that the epithet is in fact not uncommon in academic discourse. For example, at a memorable job interview held during the final year of my graduate training, a member of the hiring com- mittee - a reputable Canadian Marxist scholar - suggested that, based on my job talk and publications, there were in fact "two" versions of me: "one a politically and socially engaged researcher, and the other, well, a tree hugger." Once again, 1 tried to defend myself, this time by questioning the logic of his accusation. "Why can't one be both socially and environmentally concerned at the same time?" 1 asked, arguing that one cannot be an effective activist in either sphere without considering the politics of the other. After all, virtually all of our social practices have environmental consequences, just as our environmental practices have implications for the social realm. But despite what I thought was a reason- able argument concerning the need to expand the contexts informing activist thinking in the Humanities, my inquisitor remained unconvinced; at the end of the interview, he sat across the table wearing a sly grin, apparently confident that he had revealed my intellectual flaw for all to see. "Behold," he seemed to be saying, "I give you - the tree hugger!" (Naturally, 1 didn't get the job offer.) Later that day, the departmental chair seemed a bit embarrassed that his col- league had called me a tree hugger. Privately confessing that he himself wrote a bit of ecocriticism, he said that he personally viewed environmental studies as a legitimate field of inquiry for literary scholarship. "Of course," he added, as if making a friendly joke, "I would never go so far as to put on rubber boots and 6</page><page sequence="3">clean up a stream!" Although 1 appreciated the chair's candor, 1 wasn't sure how to respond to this odd remark. So I simply nodded my head, too tired after an arduous day of interviewing - or maybe simply too embarrassed - to admit that my partner and I had recently spent a weekend afternoon removing four or five garbage bags of plastic trash from a favorite creek bed near our home. For a time, I wondered whether these personal experiences merely reflected the biased viewpoints of the individual scholars in question and not a larger con- sensus of academic opinion. But I've since come to understand that the problem is more widespread, perhaps even systemic. Not too long ago, to cite a notable example, the editorial board at one of academia's most influential literary jour- nals, Publications of the Modern Language Association (or PMLA), rejected Scott Slovic's proposal to edit a special issue devoted to the interdisciplinary study of literary and environmental concerns. While such a rejection is not in and of itself sufficient cause for alarm, the editors' response was particularly telling: "However unfair this may be, a general perception is that environmental studies is 'soft.' As several board members put it, ... [environmental studies] is characterized as 'hug-the-tree stuff" (qtd. in Slovic 6). While it is one thing to dismiss a particular academic pursuit on the basis of identifiable intellectual or critical shortcomings, it is quite another to reject a project because of the way "it is characterized." By invoking the "tree hugger" epithet, the PMLA editorial board unfortunately suggested that its decision was being driven in this instance as much by the power of stereotyping as by an otherwise admirable concern to publish the most incisive and significant academic scholarship. In the following pages, I analyze some of the central connotations inform- ing both popular and academic usages of the "tree hugger" epithet, paying par- ticular attention to the way such usages function to caricature environmentalism by encoding stereotypical accusations of misanthropy, romantic anti-rationalism, and sexual deviance.2 This discussion will be offset by an examination of the epithet's more positive signification among environmentalists themselves, fol- lowed by a consideration of various complex "scenes" of tree hugging as repre- sented in selected literary texts. II. Tree Hugging and Misanthropy Either implicitly or explicitly, the accusation of misanthropy informs all stereotypical usages of the "tree hugger" epithet. This accusation relies, of course, upon the logic of binary opposition, the idea that one cannot love both nature and humankind at the same time. From such a standpoint, the tree hug- ger' s embrace of nature can be understood only as a symptom of misplaced care and attention, a gesture ostensibly demonstrating that his or her sympathies have been diverted from other human beings to the non-human world. Ecocriticism 7</page><page sequence="4">enables us to question this assumption by insisting upon the contextual intercon- nection of the social and environmental spheres, and by foregrounding the de- monstrable fact that human welfare and prosperity depend to a great extent upon nature's well-being and our ability to formulate ecologically sustainable prac- tices. Admittedly, environmentalists themselves sometimes adopt an openly mis- anthropic and socially irresponsible stance. From Edward Abbey's blunt asser- tion that he would rather kill a man than a snake to Garret Hardin's claim that wilderness settings should be valued above individual human lives,3 environ- mentalist rhetoric has too often invited the kinds of hostile criticism I have been discussing. Instances of "ecoterrorism" aside, some of the most notorious exam- ples of ecological misanthropy can be glimpsed in the writings of Dave Fore- man, founder of the radical environmentalist group "Earth First!" In a discussion of Ethiopian famine, for instance, Foreman reportedly remarked that "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve. . . ." In response to George Bradford's complaints concerning this appar- ent advocation of genocide, Foreman candidly admitted that he was, indeed, "more interested in bears, rainforests, and whales than in people" (qtd. in Brad- ford 33, 35). Unfortunately, some prominent opponents of green politics, invok- ing this and other extreme examples of anti-human arrogance in environmental- ist discourse, have painted the entire movement with the same misanthropic brush, lending credence to the simplistic and mistaken position that ecological politics necessarily implies a "preference for nature" over and above humanity (Ferry 70-76), a preference implicitly signified in popular and academic dis- course by the term "tree hugger." However, the physical act of tree hugging as a mode of political activism can be traced not to a misanthropic negation of human social interests but to an affirmation of their importance. Consider, for example, India's Chipko move- ment, which is sometimes regarded as the historical progenitor of modern-day tree-hugging practice. In the early 1970s, a group of women living in the Alaknanda Valley's Reni Forest successfully halted a logging operation sched- uled to occur in the vicinity of their homes. Led by activist Gaura Devi, these women, whose husbands and fathers were absent from the village, "literally 'hugged' trees, interposing their bodies between the trees and the loggers" to prevent the forest's destruction (Jain 163-4).4 This act of community resistance was emulated by environmentalists elsewhere in India (not to mention by ecofeminist and other activists in the Western world), thus helping to inspire the popular movement now known as Chipko (a Hindi term meaning "hugging").5 The Chipko poet Ghanshyam 'Shalland poetically summarizes the movement's methodology and purpose with the following imperative: "Embrace the life of the living trees and streams / Clasp them to your hearts. . . ." (qtd. in Roda 1 10). ~8</page><page sequence="5">While, for Western readers, Shalland's reference to a heartfelt embrace might seem to smack of a sentimentalizing idealization of nature, it would be a gross over-simplification to represent Chipko's concerns solely in this manner. Indeed, as Yaakov Garb has noted, "Chipko's tree-hugging strategy . . . was devised at a meeting of a local workers' cooperative as a way not so much of preventing the felling of trees, but of protesting the preferential allocation of tree resin supplies to distant and highly capitalized factories rather than coopera- tively run local ones" (Garb 276). Concerned with supporting local workers, India's early Chipko activists - perhaps the first modern-day tree huggers - were not expressing a misanthropic "preference for nature"; rather, they were enact- ing a Marxist and nationalist mode of political resistance (Haigh 103). High- lighting important connections existing between environmental and socioeco- nomic realities, Chipko activism gives the lie to sweeping anti-environmentalist generalizations that equate ecological politics with social disengagement and misanthropic behavior. Clearly, the simplistic notion that environmentalism "worships trees and sacrifices people" (qtd. in Bailey 1 1)6 needs to be reconsid- ered, especially where it informs casual usages of the "tree hugger" stereotype. III. Tree Hugging and Romantic Anti-Rationalism Less weighty than the accusation of misanthropy - but nevertheless central to much anti-environmentalist discourse - is the related stereotype of the eco- logical activist as an irrational sentimentalist. Like the charge of misanthropy, this stereotype is to a certain extent supported by historical circumstance, for modern-day environmentalism arose in the 1960s and 1970s amidst "a new flowering of nature sentimentalism" and visionary romanticism (Lutts 193). Since an embrace generally carries connotations of emotional attachment, the term "tree hugger" often tends in its stereotypical employment to depict envi- ronmentalism in terms of pathos. And since the tree hugger not only desires to protect the welfare of trees but also that of the wild creatures they shelter, his or her sentimental attraction to forests usually implies a similar attraction to ani- mals. For opponents of green politics, this environmentalist zoophilia commonly manifests itself in such "bleeding heart" pathologies as "the Bambi syndrome," whose symptoms culminate in an irrational opposition to the hunting of all wild creatures deemed aesthetically pleasing.7 Not surprisingly, anti-hunting activists have occasionally adopted strategies similar to those used by Chipko-style envi- ronmentalists; for just as the latter activists position their bodies between lumber workers and the trees of a targeted cut block, the former have sometimes threat- ened "to place their own bodies between the hunters and the deer" (Lutts 201). Emotional attachment, it seems, can be a powerful motivator of activist resis- tance. _ -</page><page sequence="6">Because the privileging of emotion or imagination over reason and the cele- bration of nature over culture are generally seen as hallmarks of romantic phi- losophy, a number of critics and supporters of green politics have regarded envi- ronmentalism as romanticism's latest avatar. This view of ecological history is in many ways well-founded.8 Like many of today's environmentalists, the ro- mantics tended to be suspicious of contemporary ideas of human progress, see- ing scientific rationality, unbridled technological innovation, and capitalist in- dustrialism as potentially harmful both to human society and the natural envi- ronment. In late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth-century England, for example, romantic authors like William Wordsworth, William Blake, and Mary Shelley often criticized the rationalist establishment, decrying science for rendering the physical world and its non-human constituents mere objects of study divorced from, or instrumental^ subservient to, the controlling realm of human cognitive practice. Refusing to affirm Enlightenment science's effort to consolidate and extend "the Empire of Man over inferior Creatures" (Glanville 188),9 the roman- tics conceptualized a harmonious, non-hierarchical relationship between humans and the natural world, a holistic relationship of mutual interchange between in- terconnected and interdependent subject and object worlds. To a certain extent, romantic philosophy involved a concerted effort to feel or imagine this relation- ship, the sense of which seemed unavailable to the purely rational, objective mindset. As a number of commentators have suggested, romanticism's "holis- tic" approach to human/nature relations anticipated the modern-day ecological dictum that "everything is connected to everything else" (Commoner 33). 10 To understand and assess possible connections between romanticism and modern "tree-hugging" practice, we should first consider some key romantic representations of forests and trees; for, in romantic poetry, such representations often deliberately eschew objective and instrumental modes of logic. One of the best examples of this tendency can be found in Wordsworth's "The Tables Turned" (1798). In this poem, "William" rejects his friend's admonition that he should trade direct experience in nature's green world for the wisdom of books, arguing that One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man; Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. (lines 21-4) Compare these lines to a remarkable passage by Wordsworth's visionary con- temporary, William Blake, who, in his epic poem Milton (c. 1804-18), also de- picts trees as potential sources of enlightened pedagogy and moral instruction: Thou seest the Trees on mountains The wind blows heavy, loud they thunder thro' the darksom sky Uttering prophecies &amp; speaking instructive words to the sons _</page><page sequence="7">Of men: These are ... the Visions of Eternity. . . . (plate 26, lines 7, 9-10) Although important differences mark their overall views of nature, Wordsworth and Blake demonstrate in these passages a shared understanding of trees and forest as sources of instructive wisdom and even arbiters of human morality. Not only do such representations seem anti-scientific and anthropomorphic; they also tend to violate religious orthodoxy, thus inviting related accusations of pa- ganism and nature worship.1 ] What happens when this sort of visionary romanticism meets the world of modern-day environmentalist activism? To address this question fully would take me far beyond the scope of the present discussion. Briefly, then, let us con- sider the example of Gladys Mclntyre, head of a British Columbian activist group called the Applied Ecological Stewardship Council. In the mid-1990s, Mclntyre temporarily halted logging at Tenise Creek, in the West Kootenay Mountains, on the strength of her claim that she once heard, while tree-planting on a nearby clear-cut, "a hymn of great praise" issuing from the old-growth for- est there. "And as close as I could put words to it," she testified on Canadian national television, "the message [of the hymn] went, 'O ye noble and worthy exploiters and conquerors, have mercy, allow us grace. Do not end our singing which allows your own life here.'"12 Despite - or, perhaps, because of - its visionary approach to environmental- ism, the Applied Ecological Stewardship Council has had some success in its battle against the destruction of the "Singing Forest," for British Columbia's Commission on Resources and Environment allows anti-logging litigation to be filed on the basis of the "Spiritual/Aesthetic" value of a targeted cut block. Call- ing the trees at Tenise Creek "great divas ... at worship" and "super-physical beings of the angelic hierarchy," Mclntyre sounds a lot like Blake (though ad- mittedly her rhetoric excludes the various anti-natural outbursts that constantly qualify Blake's representations of the natural world). Not surprisingly - and not unlike Blake in his own time - Mclntyre's opponents do not hesitate to question the sanity of her discourse. For example, one irate sawmill worker has called her idea of a singing forest "the craziest thing I've ever heard"; while another ob- jects to her seemingly mad conflation of spirituality and naturalism: "If you want a religious experience," he succinctly declares, "head for church" ("Sing- ing Trees" 2). Clearly, although Mclntyre's modern-day romantic activism has proven effective in some situations, its visionary character leaves it vulnerable to polemical contestation by mainstream lobbyists, who tend to advocate the need for rational debate based on objective rather than subjective criteria, especially in situations where resource-based industrial jobs are at stake. In a general sense, the charge of "tree hugging" - which I have heard leveled at Mclntyre and her fellow activists on more than one occasion - reinforces the common generaliza- ñ</page><page sequence="8">tion that today's environmentalists have inherited the romantics' anti-scientific mindset, rendering them anachronistically out of step with the practical concerns of progressive society. Although the equation of environmentalism and romantic irrationality is sometimes justified, it would be reductive to view the entire environmentalist movement in this light. Indeed, it was Coleridge himself - one of romanticism's greatest "prophets of nature" - who argued that romantic poets should be well schooled not only in human sympathies and traditional poetic concerns but also in virtually every field of contemporary science.13 Coleridge's "green romanti- cism" thus anticipates Glen A. Love's recent call for ecological critics to conjoin in their practice both scientific and humanistic or literary insights (Love 37-64). As the ever-growing interdisciplinary body of ecocritical and other "green" lit- erature attests, modern environmentalism occupies a diverse spectrum of dis- course ranging from the quasi-mystical insights of deep ecology to the empirical rationality of much mainstream ecological science; and some of the most trenchant critiques of the former tendency have come from within the field of ecocriticism itself.14 In a general sense, ecocriticism is motivated at least as much by objective and self-reflexive modes of rationalism as by non-rationalist modes of ethical sympathy for human and other living creatures. By stereotyp- ing environmentalists as irrational romantics, the term "tree hugger" denies the manifold complexities informing both romanticism and environmentalism. IV. Tree Hugging and Sexual Deviance In addition to implying the charges of misanthropy and anti-rationalism, the term "tree hugger" often slyly encodes accusations of sexual deviance which, by indicting the activist's personal character, function to encourage an adhominem dismissal of his or her environmentalist concerns. Forceful examples equating "tree hugging" with such deviance can be found in both the novel and film ver- sions of Peter Carey's Bliss (1981), each of which trenchantly criticizes Ameri- can capitalist imperialism and corporate globalization. As a sort of post-colonial bildüngsroman (or narrative of education), Bliss traces the development of its protagonist, Harry Joy, from a dissolute, self-interested business executive, who gets rich selling advertising copy to capitalist producers of carcinogenic toxins, to a responsible member of a sustainable community. During the process of his remarkable transformation, which occurs after he flees the city to seek the shel- tered spaces of the rainforest at Bog Onion Road, Harry discovers the healing power of trees. As the novel puts it, he loves "to place his arms around a big tallow wood when the wind blows and feel its strength and put his face against its rough bark." But when he attempts to describe this sort of experience to oth- ers, he arouses significant suspicions: "'When you talk about trees,' Paul Bees lì</page><page sequence="9">said, ... 'it sounds like you want a fuck'" (Carey 284, 286-87). What Harry is really attempting to express in his discussions of trees is the newfound sense of ecological awareness and humility they inspire in his heart and mind. But even a listener as sympathetic as Paul Bees cannot resist the temptation to see Harry's arboreal fascination as somehow perverse, a symptom of misdirected sexual desire.15 The implicit or explicit correlation of environmentalism and sexual devi- ance is all-too-often apparent in popular culture, where an adjectival use of "tree hugger" commonly modifies a substantive reference to effeminacy or homo- sexuality. "Real" men, it seems, don't embrace nature; rather, to invoke Old Testament discourse, they "subdue" and "have dominion" over it (Gen. 1:28). Recalling my own first encounter with the term "tree hugger" (described at the beginning of this essay), I recently entered the phrase "tree hugging faggot" in internet searches on the Google and Yahoo search engines. Although I expected to find a few relevant websites, I was surprised by the sheer number of times these words appeared together on the internet (approximately 5,560 hits on Google, and 13,400 hits on Yahoo!).16 On the websites in question, and in the wider cultural discourse in which they participate, this merely adjectival de- ployment of "tree hugger" seems to indicate a sense of discomfort attending the epithet's usage, suggesting that it fails of its own weight to communicate the sort of bald contempt heterosexist society reserves for homosexuals. By correlating or equating environmentalism with homosexuality, bigoted individuals are able rhetorically to invoke in their auditors the pathos commonly associated with what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick describes as "homosexual panic" (Sedgwick 89), a cultural and psychological response conditioned by patriarchal society to pre- scribe and police the sexuality of its male constituents. If tree huggers are sexual deviants, the argument implies, their political positions must by association be suspect as well. Because of the remarkably widespread popularity of phrases like "tree-hugging faggot," I can't help but think that the epithet "tree hugger," even when used on its own as a substantive construction, often carries at least a trace of heterosexist connotation. Predictably, popular discourse inevitably offers ways of dealing with the environmentalist's ostensible deviance. Sporting a cartoon image depicting a logger preparing to shove a spotted owl up a long-haired man's rectum, for ex- ample, one proudly vulgar bumper sticker urges people to "Bugger a Hugger," suggesting, it seems, that sexual violation would be a fitting punishment for the environmentalist's deviant behavioral politics. Admittedly, this is a rather ex- treme example of anti-tree-hugging rhetoric. A more common bumper sticker offers what appears to be a kinder, gentler, seemingly reconciliatory message regarding the environmental activist's ostensible deviance, aiming its discourse not at the anti-environmentalist but at the tree hugger him- or herself: "Hug a 13</page><page sequence="10">Logger - You'll Never Go Back to Trees." According to the logic of this im- perative slogan, environmental activists - like homosexuals as they are repre- sented in much hetero-normative discourse - can indeed be reformed and reha- bilitated, cured of both their misanthropic impulses and their implicit sexual deviance simply by redirecting their embrace toward a more appropriate (i.e., a human) object, the lovable and hardworking fellow holding the chainsaw. At this juncture, we should bear in mind Homi K. Bhabha's observation that the stereotype is itself an ambivalent structure of predication whose cultural au- thority always remains less than stable; for while it pretends to represent an ob- vious, entirely self-evident truth - something that "goes without saying" - the stereotype paradoxically requires constant reiteration in order to achieve its dis- cursive status as such (for what else is a stereotype but a social or cultural repre- sentation articulated over and over ad nauseami). Bhabha's critique reminds us that those who habitually employ stereotypes "doth protest too much," thereby performatively undermining the authority of their seemingly self-confident dis- cursive positions (Bhabha 66). But what 1 find most striking about the popular conjoining of anti-homosexual and anti-environmentalist representations in a phrase like "tree-hugging faggot" is the sense of rhetorical discomfort such con- joining seems to indicate on the part of the enunciator, suggesting his or her awareness that, used separately, derogatory signifiers like "faggot" and "tree hugger" may be losing something of their ability to rally forceful reactionary opposition in a popular climate of slowly increasing tolerance for homosexuality and environmentalist activism. Identifying environmentalists as homosexuals or homosexuals as environmentalists, phrases like "tree-hugging faggot" seem in- tended to shore up otherwise vulnerable right-wing positions by creating a mon- strously composite other, a human subject whose ostensible deviance knows no bounds. V. Linguistic Turf Wars: Transvaluating Popular Epithets Like most epithets, of course, "tree hugger" is not always as negatively charged as I have thus far suggested. On the contrary, some activists, environ- mental studies scholars, and nature enthusiasts actually embrace the epithet, using it with or without irony to identify themselves and their political positions. A few self-identified tree huggers go so far as to engage in a commuter's dia- logue with their anti-environmentalist detractors, defying "Bugger a Hugger" and other anti-environmentalist slogans by proudly displaying bumper stickers proclaiming their status as "Tree Hugging Dirt Worshiperfs]." In its more posi- tive sense, indeed, "tree hugger" might be understood as a signifier of "bio- philia," the term coined by Pulitzer Prize-winning biologist Edward O. Wilson to describe a deep-seated human psychological attraction to, and need to connect __</page><page sequence="11">with, the biological world (Wilson passim). Given the popular currency and po- tentially positive signification of "tree hugger," not to mention its overt self- referential usage by at least some members of the environmentalist community, we would do well to ask whether the phrase might be cleansed of its adverse connotations and redefined. Rather than rejecting "tree hugger" as a term hope- lessly compromised by widespread derogatory usage, in other words, environ- mentalists might perhaps enhance its positive signification through a concerted effort of semantic revision. Certainly, in the context of other popular social movements, activists have attempted to reclaim similarly derogatory epithets in order to harness the signifying power that attends their widespread cultural us- age. In the late 1970s, for example, radical feminist writer Mary Daly attempted to "transvaluate" such common sexist epithets as "spinster," "hag," and "crone," rejecting their negative patriarchal meanings and refraining them as terms of respect and feminist self-empowerment. According to Daly, this process of lin- guistic revision is an integral part of radical feminist resistance, helping to un- mask "deceptive patriarchal history, [and] rendering it obsolete" (Daly 14). In the following decade, a similar linguistic project informed the sexual activism of such groups as Queer nation, ActUp, and Outrage, who successfully reclaimed the formerly derogatory word "queer" as a term of positive self- and commu- nity-identification (Seiden et. al. 254). In some parts of the homosexual commu- nity, indeed, activists have even attempted to reclaim the "hate word" "faggot" as a positive term of self-identification.17 And yet, despite concerted efforts of linguistic renovation, terms like "hag," "queer," and "faggot" continue to be deployed as insults by groups antagonistic to the rights of women and homo- sexuals, thus affirming the wisdom of Gloria Nay lor' s assertion that "Words themselves are innocuous; it is the consensus that gives them true power" (Nay- lor 460). Certainly, we should keep Nay lor' s comment in mind while consider- ing the diverse ways in which "tree hugger" signifies and circulates in the com- plex realm of social discourse. Among other things, Nay lor' s linguistic insight highlights the important role enunciative contexts play in determining the semantic status of keywords used in processes of cultural identification. Consider her autobiographical dis- cussion of the epithet "nigger." When used by black people among family and friends, this otherwise objectionable epithet can function as a term of endear- ment, an affirmation of manhood, or a possible rebuke, thus demonstrating a broad range of possible significance. Naylor therefore dismisses the critical ob- jection that "use of the word nigger at this social stratum of the black commu- nity [necessarily implies] an internalization of racism," arguing instead that "the people in my grandmother's living room took a word that whites used to signify worthlessness and degradation and rendered it impotent. Gathering there to- _</page><page sequence="12">gether, they transformed 'nigger' to signify the varied and complex beings they knew themselves to be" (Naylor 461). A similar insight might be applied to our consideration of the "tree hugger" epithet: when environmentalists use it among themselves, it can function as a signifier of mutual respect, a term acknowledg- ing one's commitment to the natural environment and the creation of a sustain- able human future. As in the case of the word "nigger," it is only when "tree hugger" is spoken by a hostile outsider that it necessarily carries abusive and hurtful connotations. Most people will agree that inflammatory usages of the term "tree hugger" are relatively innocuous in comparison to similar usages of words like "hag," "queer," or "nigger"; for in contrast to such marginalized groups as women, homosexuals, and black people, environmentalists have not experienced or in- herited a substantial history of systemic oppression and disenfranchisement, nor are they necessarily members of a visible or easily identifiable minority. What makes "tree hugger" different from the above-mentioned epithets is the non- human aspect of its signification, the way it conjoins its human referent to a vul- nerable realm of nature; for the environmentalist's main concern is not only to emancipate and empower certain human constituencies but also to raise aware- ness concerning the need to change human environmental practices in general. Nevertheless, in considering the significance of "tree hugger," we should bear in mind the important role social contexts play in the term's semantic valuation. And we must never forget that linguistic transformation is an integral aspect of broader social and historical change. Before offering my own view concerning the efficacy of transvaluating and reclaiming "tree hugger," 1 would like to explore some significant literary repre- sentations of arboreal embrace in order to demonstrate the potential complexity of tree hugging as a literary and cultural figure; for such an exploration will help to contextualize my ultimate position on the epithet in question. VI. Some Literary Tree Huggers In literary texts of the British romantic period (which some commentators regard as influential precursors of modern-day environmentalist writing),18 char- acters' responses to nature, and trees in particular, often function as indicators of moral development or degeneracy. For example, texts as diverse as Ann Rad- cliffe's gothic opus The Mysteries ofUdolpho (1794) and Jane Austen's domes- tic bildiingsroman Sense and Sensibility (1811) sometimes differentiate protago- nists from antagonists on the basis of the attitudes they express toward trees. According to the novels' aesthetic schémas, we know that Radcliffe's Monsieur Quesnel and Austen's Mrs. Fanny Dashwood are deserving of suspicion or even contempt, for when they inherit or otherwise expropriate the heroines' family _</page><page sequence="13">estates, they quickly devise plans to destroy noble stands of chestnut or walnut (Radcliffe 13; Austen 192), trees much prized by the protagonists, to make way for modern "improvements." Anticipating modern-day ecological thought, au- thors like Radcliffe and Austen tend to value tree conservation over and above the exigencies of "progress." Some romantic-period texts go so far as to depict scenes in which central characters actually demonstrate their love of nature by hugging trees. Consider, for example, Mary Shelley's The Last Man (1826), a futuristic novel prophesy- ing the annihilation of humankind in the late twenty-first century due to a pan- demic outbreak of plague. As the novel's central characters, the last remaining members of English society, prepare to leave their beloved England to seek what they hope will be the healthier, pestilence-free climes of southern Europe, the narrator, Lionel Verney, discovers his wife Idris "clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips" (Shelley, Last Man 328). Shel- ley's choice of the oak - a traditional symbol of England - as the object of Idris's embrace is obviously deliberate, for as Idris herself declares only a few sentences later, she is mourning the "loss of my adored country." Tree hugging thus functions here as a figure for patriotic nationalism. And yet, as we discover in the subsequent paragraph, this tree-hugging scene also has important envi- ronmental significance, for, in embracing the oak, Idris is also bidding farewell to "the trees and forest paths she loved" (328). Far from functioning merely as a sign of facile sentimentalism or misplaced emotion, Idris's arboreal embrace unites in a single complex figure Shelley's concern to explore in The Last Man related questions of nationalism and naturalism - the patriotic love of country and the aesthetic attachment to bioregion - the two of which, for better or worse, cannot be considered in isolation. Shelley seems to have had a particular fascination for tree-hugging imagery, for she also deploys it in Valperga (1823), a historical novel depicting the politi- cal intrigues of fourteenth-century Italy. In this text the beautiful but hapless Beatrice is victimized by a series of self-interested and morally bankrupt charac- ters, the worst of whom is the villainous Tripalda. After spending three long years in the dark confínes of Tripalda' s gothic dungeon, Beatrice experiences a sense of passionate delight upon the occasion of her release: "I became delirious with joy; I embraced the rough trunks of the old trees, as if they were my sisters in freedom and delight; ... I threw myself on the earth, I kissed the rocks, I raved with tumultuous pleasure. Free! free!. . ." (Shelley, Valperga 300). In this remarkable passage, tree hugging ultimately has ambivalent significance. At the level of plot development, it functions, on the one hand, to emphasize the extent of Beatrice's joy when she is suddenly delivered from her unnatural imprison- ment and the unspeakable suffering it has occasioned. As "sisters in freedom and delight," moreover, Beatrice's trees are deliberately feminized, suggesting ñ</page><page sequence="14">that, in a world dominated by violent men, they share a bond of feminine sympa- thy with the one who hugs them. On the other hand, as references to Beatrice's "delirious" condition and "rav[ing]" mode of behavior surely indicate, tree hug- ging in Valperga also functions as a symptom of the impending madness to which Beatrice will ultimately succumb in the novel. A simultaneous figure for corporeal emancipation and psychological pathology, Shelley's depiction of tree hugging is fraught with complexity, highlighting her ultimate ambivalence con- cerning Romanticism's "biophiliac" desire to embrace and bond with the non- human world. Other romantic and post-romantic representations of trees and tree hugging raise important philosophical and epistemological questions concerning the hu- man relationship to the non-human world. In an oft-quoted 1843 letter to Isa- bella Fenwick, for example, an aging Wordsworth attempted to explain both the joys and the dangers attending his romantic idealism. Tracing the origins of this idealism to his early youth, Wordsworth recalls the sense he often felt as a child concerning "the indomitableness of the spirit within me." Associated with hu- bristic notions of human transcendence and dominion over the natural world, Wordsworth's youthful idealism thus tended to encourage an idealistic negation of his own material existence. Indeed, as the poet retrospectively notes, "I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence, and I com- muned with all that I saw as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature. Many times while going to school have 1 grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality" (qtd. in Abrams 286). While this is not exactly a scene of tree hugging per se, it is nevertheless significant; for Wordsworth's occasional grasping at a tree - an embrace of sorts based on an instinct for self-preservation - functions here to correct an overac- tive and potentially harmful idealism, recalling the youth to the material world that provides the literal ground of his own imaginative activity.19 In the closing paragraphs of his neo-romantic work The Night Country (1971), Loren Eiseley, like Wordsworth, reflects upon his youthful relationship to the natural world, whose symbolic representative is a tree. Lamenting the increasing dislocation of such urban animals as mice, pigeons, and old men - all hapless victims of human "progress" - Eiseley criticizes a postmodern world in which all creatures seem inevitably to become disconnected from their social and natural environments. He finds a degree of comfort, however, in the retro- spective contemplation of his long-lost rural childhood and, in particular, in the well-worn memory of a seedling he and his father had planted together in a covenantal act connecting them to each other and to the physical landscape of home. This tree, unseen since his sudden and unforeseen urban dislocation shortly after its planting, becomes in Eiseley' s nostalgic mind a dynamic em- blem of permanence and integrated connection to nature and family, providing a "Ï8</page><page sequence="15">sharp symbolic contrast to the crass urban world of getting and spending. In an effort, therefore, to regain his former sense of wholeness, an aging Eiseley makes a long overdue pilgrimage to his childhood home, hoping to see and touch the tree that had for so long "bloomed on in my individual mind." Unfor- tunately, upon his arrival, he discovers that the tree "no longer was," realizing indeed that it had likely "perished in its first season." Bereft of the imaginative support the remembered tree had provided during his joyless sojourn in the city, the author suddenly develops an overwhelming sense of vertigo; and, like the young Wordsworth, he reaches out to embrace a convenient prop: "I took a firm grasp on airy nothing - to be precise, on the bole of a great tree" (Eiseley 236). But whereas Wordsworth represents his arboreal prop in terms of the "real," a physical antidote to his own excessively abstruse idealism, Eiseley, as if critiqu- ing Wordsworth's romantic formula, represents his tree as an unexpected ab- straction, the locus not of material solidity but of "airy nothing." The very object that he had for so long valued as quintessential^ "real," in other words, enters the text as absence or imaginative simulacrum. Although Eiseley is clearly con- cerned to explore the psychological consequences of environmental destruction and human dislocation, his autobiographical account also raises an important epistemological concern. By imbuing natural objects with our own cherished views of imaginative significance, Eiseley suggests, we actually produce that which we understand as palpable, pre-given reality. One of the most memorable tree-hugging scenes in American literature may be found in John Muir's The Mountains of California (1894). In a chapter enti- tled "A Wind-Storm in the Forests," Muir recounts his experiences as an early storm chaser, one who literally immerses himself in "storm-culture" (Muir 743) in order to observe and study a windstorm's effects upon the trees and forests of the Sierra Nevada. In contrast to the preceding examples drawn from Words- worth and Eiseley, however, Muir does not depict trees as figures epitomizing explicitly human moral or epistemological concerns; rather, he represents them in a manner that emphasizes - and helps his readers to appreciate - their own dynamic otherness. Venturing fearlessly out into near-hurricane-force winds, Muir deliberately scales a carefully selected Douglas spruce in order to obtain first-hand knowledge of the interaction between trees and wind. As he reaches the spruce's uppermost branches he becomes a tree hugger out of sheer neces- sity, hanging on for dear life as the tree sways violently in the blast: "[NJever before did I enjoy so noble an exhilaration of motion. The slender tops fairly flapped and swished in the passionate torrent, bending and swirling backward and forward, round and round, tracing indescribable combinations of vertical and horizontal curves, while I clung with muscles firm braced, like a bobolink on a reed" (746). In its combined use of anthropomorphism (the wind repre- sented as a "passionate torrent") and zoomorphism (Muir's self-representation 19</page><page sequence="16">as "a bobolink on a reed"), this passage nicely balances human and ecocentric concerns, helping the reader to appreciate Muir's subjective response to the "Aeolian music" of the tree's "topmost needles" (745) while at the same time accurately describing the tree's amazing physical response to the storm's exces- sive force. As a renowned naturalist and founder of the Sierra Club, Muir might well be regarded as an archetypal modern tree hugger; but his quintessential tree-hugging scene retains a strong sense of scientific purpose, betraying no hint of the gross sentimentality, misanthropy, or sexual deviance so commonly asso- ciated with the tree hugger stereotype. VII. Epilogue As the preceding discussion should indicate, there are many ways in which the term "tree hugger" might be represented apart from contemporary stereo- types. In recent history, India's Chipko movement demonstrates how tree hug- ging as a mode of engaged activism affirms the existence of a philanthropic, socially engaged environmentalist practice. In the realm of literature, Mary Shel- ley's tree-hugging scenes point toward a seemingly vexed ambivalence concern- ing the human relationship to nature, signifying on the one hand a profound sympathy for the natural world and on the other hand a strange sense of alien- ation, in which sympathy for nature reveals itself as a figure for such things as residual patriotism or psychological pathology. And, in ways that seem re- markably cognate and yet strangely at odds, Wordsworth's and Eiseley's "grasp- ing" at trees is part of a larger discourse concerned to negotiate the apparent borderline separating what we conventionally understand as the "ideal" and the "real"; while Muir's tree-hugging scene is the culmination of a highly dra- matic - but nonetheless scientific - account of arboreal otherness. In concert, these historical and literary examples demonstrate the remarkable complexity of tree hugging in its literal and figurative manifestations, belying the reductive character of common anti-environmentalist stereotypes. Clearly, environmentalists and ecocritics would do well to question reduc- tive stereotyping at every turn; for, far from being members of a homogeneous group, they embrace a remarkably diverse array of philosophies and practices, including, to name only a few, conservation, deep ecology, ecofeminism, green romanticism, social ecology, human ecology, and actual Chipko-style, front-line tree hugging. And not only are these modes of environmentalism sometimes at odds with each other; each is internally diverse as well. In self-defense, envi- ronmentalists might take some inspiration from writers like Mary Daly and Glo- ria Naylor, transvaluating and reclaiming the epithet "tree hugger" in order to exploit the term's popular currency - and thereby affirming an environmentalist movement that is as rich and complex as any existing human institution. ^20</page><page sequence="17">And yet, when I think of my own encounters with the epithet, I am not con- vinced that its reclamation would ultimately serve any efficacious purpose. In both its popular and academic usage, the term's derogatory connotations are extremely well-established. While, as we have seen, "it is the consensus that gives [words] true power" (Naylor 460), certain words tend largely to serve rhe- torical strategies of rfwempowerment and othering. In my own view, the term "tree hugger" is far too often used in this manner to oversimplify the diverse peoples and complex political issues to which it might otherwise refer. Unfortu- nately, such stereotypical usage commonly informs larger strategies of discur- sive dismissal and silencing characterized by misunderstanding, unexamined prejudice, and not-so-veiled contempt. Moreover, in an economic climate often subject to the rhetoric of corporate "green-washing," the epithet's potentially positive transvaluation would not necessarily imply the strengthening of a radi- cal discourse of environmentalism. One only need consider, for example, a re- cent Shell Oil television advertisement featuring Damián Miller, a member of Shell's new generation of project managers. Proudly telling the viewer that he has been "called a hippy," Miller aligns himself with both green politics and 1960s counterculture, thus helping his employer to co-opt these modes of radical activism for its own corporate benefit. Better still, the advertisement briefly de- picts him thoughtfully embracing the trunk of a tree, iconographically signifying his employer's ostensible ethic of care and concern for the natural world's wel- fare.20 To be sure, there are some contexts in which "tree hugger" might itself be embraced as an honorable term of self-identification. But in the academic world, where scholars strive to obtain an open-minded view of things, and where so much social scientific and humanities scholarship is devoted to addressing ineq- uities and challenging oppressive regimes of all kinds, the term - while a sig- nificant object of lexical and cultural analysis - reveals in its too-casual critical usage at best the appalling absence of informed understanding and at worst the insidious presence of contemptuous prejudice. This is by no means to suggest that environmentalists and their practices should be somehow immune to social criticism. On the contrary, environmentalism, like all modes of critical practice, must be rigorously scrutinized by both its advocates and its opponents. But if we are to engage in genuine dialogue and debate, both sides would do well to avoid the casual employment of reductive epithets; for, ultimately - at least in the con- text of academic discourse - the term "tree hugger" is about as useful and in- formative as "redneck," its equally reductive and stereotypical opposite. Let's move beyond the polarizing employment of slights and epithets, beyond the rhetorical hurling of sticks and stones, and address the actual issues informing the uses and abuses of environmentalist theory and practice. 21</page><page sequence="18">Notes 'For a succinct summary of ecofeminist philosophical positions, see War- ren, ix-xxvi. Research for this essay was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding provided by the Canada Research Chairs Program and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. A portion of this paper was presented at the 2005 Conference of the Association for the Study of Literature and Envi- ronment, Universitv of Oregon, Eugene, June 22, 2005. 2For a formal rhetorical analysis of "tree-hugger" and its various usages in American newspaper stories, see DeLoach et. al., "An Analysis of the 'Tree- Hugger' Label." In this essay, the authors note that "anti-environmental dis- course ridicules environmentalists as 'tree-huggers' to delegitimize and dismiss the rhetoric of environmental advocacy" (95). Among other things, the authors examine the tree-hugger label as an example of the strategic trope Reductio ad Absurdum (97-101); but they also consider the word's more positive use as a "self-identifier" among some environmentalists (100-101). Containing valuable information and insight, the essay came to my attention after my own discussion had been completed and accepted for publication, regrettably too late for me to engage with its analyses here. 3For a brief discussion of misanthropic attitudes in Abbey and Hardin, see Callicott 50. 4I would like to thank my graduate research assistant, Kelly Wintemute, for drawing my attention to each of the Chipko studies cited in this essay. For a discussion of Chipko influence on Western environmentalism see Garb, especially 273-75. Paradoxically, while accusing environmentalists of misanthropically ignor- ing issues concerning human welfare, right-wing polemicists like Ronald Bailey simultaneously condemn the "environmental movement's widening social jus- tice agenda," simplistically implying that green politics has no business engag- ing with problems of social and economic justice (Bailey 8-10). Faced with such contradictory criticism, environmentalists and ecocritics are clearly "damned if they do and damned if they don't" advocate a socially engaged praxis. 7See Cartmill passim, and Lutts 198-202. For a highly critical correlation of environmentalism and romanticism, see Ferry 93-9. For much more positive correlations of the same, see Bate passim; and McKusick passim. McKusick correctly argues that American environmen- talism owes a profound, but all too often unacknowledged, debt to British ro- manticism (2-11). 9Glanville was a prominent seventeenth-century disciple of Francis Bacon's empiricism. For additional comments by Enlightenment-era scientists concern- 22</page><page sequence="19">ing the concept of human "dominion" or "empire" over nature, see Bacon 114; and Descartes 1 19. See also Worster 26-55. 10On the relationship between romanticism's holistic philosophy and mod- ern-day ecological paradigms, see, for example, Kroeber 53-56; Bate 36-61; and McKusick 35-51. nFor a discussion of differences between Blake's and Wordsworth's con- cepts of nature, see Hutchings, Imagining Nature 38-40. For a detailed discus- sion of Blake's prophesying trees, see 1 14-20 of the same text; and for a broader analysis of prophecy in both romantic naturalism and modern-day environmen- talism, see Hutchings, "The Modal Roots of Environmentalism" passim. Gladys Mclntyre, qtd. from television transcripts of "Singing Trees" 1. 13In order to become a true epic poet, Coleridge asserted, one must first spend at least a decade pursuing scientific and other training: "1 would be a tol- erable Mathematician. I would thoroughly understand Mechanics; Hydrostatics; Optics and Astronomy; Botany, Metallurgy; Fossilism; Chemistry; Geology; Anatomy; Medicine; then the mind of man; then the minds of men, in all Trav- els, Voyages, and Histories" (qtd. in Byatt 199). See, for example, Biehl's critique of anti-rational tendencies in some modes of ecofeminist discourse (Biehl 83-106). 15See also the novel's critically acclaimed film adaptation, which won the 1985 Australian Academv Award for Best Picture. 16lnternet search conducted 26 August 2005 (www.google.ca; www.ya- hoo.ca). 17See, for example, sexual advice columnist Dan Savage's discussion of the epithet "faggot" in TheStranger.com passim. The best example of this argument can be found in McKusick 1-33. The fact that the poet represents himself as having "grasped at a wall or a tree" (emphasis added), moreover, helps to challenge the common mispercep- tion that Wordsworth and his fellow Romantics conceptualized the natural and human realms in terms of binary opposition.
