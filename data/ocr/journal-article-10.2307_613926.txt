This collection of texts of' self-statement ' expressions of views upon major questions of Muslim theology, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and politics-published under the auspices of Near Eastern Center, University of California, Los Angeles, makes curious reading. It is an exhibition of the intellectual furniture of Muslims of the subcontinent through the past century, with many quaint pieces reminding us of dusty and forgotten corners of the English heritage. One might compile a similar antho- logy of' Anglican self-statement ' consisting of pieces by Matthew Arnold, Bishop Wilberforce, Bishop Colenso, a British Israelite-perhaps Colonel Waddell after his Lamaist phase, Robert Bridges, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, Sir Winston Churchill, and Harold Macmillan, together with some recent White Papers and</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 619 pieces of ecclesiastical constitution-making: the total impact of the arguments, considered in vacuo, would be not dissimilar to that of these writings, with synchronisms in the development of thought and in the changes of intellectual fashion; and with rather fewer examples of the direct influence of the Anglican polemicists upon their Indo-Muslim brethren. Yet the evolving Anglican tradition-leaving aside the fact that the Church of England and its dissenting competitors have lost most of their flocks-has not been placed by the processes of history in a position where the reconciliation of its tenets with modern knowledge or with modern political conditions is a matter of urgency. The situation has been quite different for Muslims of the Indian sub- continent during this century of 'self-state- ment': and however inadequate or unaccept- able the arguments of their literati may be, the advocates of almost every point of view deserve sympathy on account of the gravity of their dilemmas. These 'gobbets' may be thought to suffer from an inadequate explanation of their context, the immediate political pressures and objectives which led, say, Sayyid Ahmad Khan or IqbMl or Jinnlh to their drastic reformula- tions of Islamic ideals. Nevertheless this selection provides, as was intended, a very useful set of readings in the history of the ideas which accompanied the changes in the political fortunes of the Muslims of the Indian sub- continent. The texts begin with Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khin's revolutionary attempt at an individua- list and fundamentalist approach to Qur'anic exegesis, arguing that his fundamentalist beliefs were consonant with what modern science had revealed regarding the natural world. 'There is no matter in the Koran disagreeing with the law of nature' (p. 30). ' For [the Koran] is the verd 5f Gaid (word of God) perfectly in agreement with the vark 5f Gad (work of God)' (p. 39). A traditionalist reply to this was given by Mawlini Abil 'l-Qasim Ninotawi, in which the long- established safeguards against individualist reinterpretation of the Qur'in are re-stated. A few passages of Ninotawi's tract are clear, but taken as a whole this text-the only statement in the whole anthology of traditional Sunni belief untouched by modernist influences-is an almost impenetrable piece of high scholastic gobbledygook, the unenviable task of translat- ing which befell Dr. Peter Hardy. Ninotawi's main concerns, where he is intelligible, are to combat Sir Sayyid's influence and to attack the presumptions concerning the validity of indi- vidualist interpretation which underlie the propositions which Sir Sayyid advanced. N~notawi's tract would appear to be not so much a refutation of the actual arguments which Sir Sayyid advanced as a rival pro- nunciamento; in which, as one suspects, even traditional scholastic processes of reasoning have largely been replaced by a comminatory incantation of learned and hallowed phrases. However, perhaps the editors, who have 'revised and abridged' Dr. Hardy's transla- tion, are partly to blame for the apparent irrelevance of Ninotawi's polemic. A com- parison with the original text (see Tasflyat al-'aqa'id, 3-5) makes it clear that they are in error in believing that the document to which Ninotawi replied (i.e. the letter to Pirji Muhammad 'Arif) 'reproduced with some alterations' the other credo of Sir Sayyid translated earlier in the volume (i.e. the letter to Muhsin al-Mulk). Both letters have 15 propositions or theses, of which the first three in each are identical in substance : the remain- ing 12 do not correspond. The tenor of Sir Sayyid's propositions in the translated letter is ontological, primarily concerned with the definition of the being and attributes of God, and of the authority of His Messenger and of the Holy Book: in the much shorter letter which attracted N~notawi's refutation, the propositions are in intention an attack on the sanctity of traditional exegesis. In the transla- tion, as here published, the theses which Ninotawi was rejecting remain unformulated. The statements of the editors that Sir Sayyid's exegesis was 'written in 1880-1895' (p. 25) and that N~notawi's denunciation of this exegesis was published in 1890 (p. 60, n.) clearly need to be reconciled. Some of the remaining pieces in the volume are not impressive as 'self-statements '-the etymological dabblings of the Mahdi of Q&amp;diin, the blithe degutting of Islamic history by Amic 'Ali, or the debating society view of the world of Mawlink Muhammad 'Ali speaking with George Lansbury in the chair: but even in these cases the standards of argument and of the use of English are such as to put to shame many current Indian and Pakistani academic productions. Other pieces reproduced here are dignified and sometimes moving-Chirigh 'Ali's attack upon the authority of badlth, which to-day shows few signs of having been written-in English-in the 1880's; Abfi 'l-Kalim Azid's exposition of the transcen- dence and the anthropomorphic attributes of God; and Mawl1nn Mawdfidi's and Ayyilb Khan's expressions of their diverse political aims. In practical politics MawlinR Mawdildi's influence was, and possibly still is, bloody and disastrous : but his finely organized prose, here translated by Charles J. Adams, enables us to realize the appeal to mobs of the poor and the pious of his covenanting zeal for ' the oblitera- tion of all corrupt governments ' which would VOL. XXXIV. PART 3. 41</page><page sequence="3">620 REVIEWS result in the establishment of the rule of the righteous. The poems in this anthology are well chosen. Ralph Russell has made a prose rendering of Hili's Musaddas with his usual skill. Iqbil is represented by excerpts from Arberry's trans- lation of the Javfd-nama and by two Urdu poems translated by V. G. Kiernan. The first of these is the celebrated piece on the mosque of C6rdoba. Though not free of minor mis- interpretations, this is an outstanding rendering into English of poetry in an oriental language. Mr. Kiernan has imitated IqbMl's unusual metre A&amp; e 04 producing in English a sequence of accentual 'elegiac pentameters ' with caesura, a possibly hitherto undiscovered but eminently con- ventional verse-form, which is matched by a carefully neo-Victorian diction: 'Colour or stone and brick, music and song or speech, Only the heart's warm blood feeds such marvels of craft... Here stands his inmost self manifest in your stones, Fire of passionate days, rapture of melting nights; Here his high station displayed, here his high-mounting thoughts, Here his joy and desire, self-abasement and pride...'. The manner of the translation calls attention to an important aspect of Iqbil's poetic style, the transference of the inner substance of English nineteenth-century poetry-particularly that of Tennyson-into the verbal framework of Indo-Persian poetic tradition. Mr. Kiernan's version is an English poem in its own right, not quite Tennysonian but curiously similar to the work of Tennyson's most talented epigoni, such neglected masters as Roden Noel and Lord de Tabley.
