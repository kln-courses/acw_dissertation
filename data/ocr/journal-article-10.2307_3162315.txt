University of Pittsburgh, 1966. Director: Dr. Seymour Drescher. In 1825 Rev. John McEnery, the Roman Catholic Chaplain of Tor Ab- bey in Devonshire discovered human fossil remains and artifacts in conjunc- tion with the skeletons of extinct mam- mals in Kent's Cavern on the Devon- shire coast. The problems which faced him in interpreting what he had found so that it did not contradict the "true" meaning of the account of creation in Genesis set the stage for the confron- tation which developments in the earth and life sciences were forcing upon conservative, iconodulic natural theo- logians. Though McEnery's work seems to have been little known until the post- humous publication of his manuscript in 1859, the logic of events forced sev- eral other English Catholics to publicly encounter the problem of reinterpret- ing the meaning of Scripture in light of developments in science. Those in- dividual Catholics most centrally in- volved in forming an approach to what was variously called the "developmen- tal hypothesis," or "transformism," or "evolution," were men such as Nich- olas Cardinal Wiseman; the Catholic Egyptologist Peter Le Page Renouf; the convert and sometime editor of the Rambler, Richard Simpson; William Kirby Sullivan, the principal scientific contributor to the Home and Foreiqn Review; the convert founder of the Rambler, John Moore Capes; the con- vert editor of the Tablet, Frederick Lucas; and John Henry Newman. The available alternatives were much less exclusive of each other in this early period of the encounter than they came to be in the latter part of the nineteenth century when scientists such as Thomas Henry Huxley took on believers such as St. George Jack- son Mivart. Since the theologians often knew little about modern science, and the scientists came to care little for theology, the struggle between the two parties to this dispute was car- ried out on the common ground of philosophy. Perennial questions such as those involving the role of analogy, the nature of causation, the difference between the utility and the truth of any hypothesis, the distinction between "providence" and "chance," and the relation of language to the things sig- nified through it were contested be- tween the champions of positivistic natural science and those who defend- ed idealistic natural theology. The realization that there was much more than mere anthropomorphism in Genesis, plus their traditional reliance upon the teaching of the Church as the arbiter of the Bible saved English Ro- man Catholics from utimately predi- cating the truth of the Scriptures upon the "truth" of any one particular sys- tem of natural theology. The thought of Catholics in England moved from a predisposition to dismiss each new de- velopment in geology or biology as a mere fad to the point where, in 1864, some realized what was happening in these fields, and one, at least, could speak appreciatively of "the influence of time upon form." The record of this difficult but hopeful transition may be traced in the writings of Cardinal Wiseman, John Henry Newman, and in the English Catholic periodicals, the Dublin Review, the Tablet, the Ram- bler, and the Home and Foreign Re- view. By 1864 the first generation of Cath- olics in England to be fully enfran- chised since the sixteenth century had slowly become aware of what the great scientific issues of the age were. And, thanks to the largely unrequited efforts of a handful of "Liberal Cath- olics," it was not yet certain that the Catholic Church would lose the mod- em world by intellectual default. The Social Policy of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America During World War I. By John Franklin Piper, Jr., Duke University, 1965. Supervisor: Wal- do Beach. The dissertation argues that the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America developed and main- tained a responsible Christian social policy during World War I. It was 355</page><page sequence="2">CHURCH HISTORY a responsible Christian policy in that it adhered to certain basic imperatives of the Christian faith. It maintained and extended the ministry of the church; it advocated the correction of abuses in the social and industrial order; it protected the trans-national character of the church; it called for prayers of penitence and forgiveness as well as for prayers of thanksgiving; it pro- moted cooperation and unity among the churches; and it reminded the people of the spiritual and moral val- ues of life. The social policy of the Council stood for these things in a time when there was a great outburst of patriotism and a growing reliance on the material aspects of life. In this social policy the Council and its leaders presented a perspective on war and the participation of the Chris- tian in it which was a genuine alterna- tive to the two perspectives which were most commonly held. One of these views was that of the pacifists, who believed that war was in essence wrong, and the other was that of the militant patriots, who saw war as a creative force. The social policy of the Council was an attempt to define a middle way between these points of view. It was based on a realistic as- sessment of the nation at war and a careful evaluation of the role of the Christian man and church in it. It accepted the war, but with little real enthusiasm. It had many affinities with the position which Reinhold Nie- buhr advocated in World War II. The essay comprises eight chapters, including an initial one which estab- lishes the thesis in the context of the scholarly opinion on the activities of the Council in the Great War. The consensus of opinion among scholars, best exemplified by Ray H. Abrams, but sustained by almost every church historian who has written on the topic, is directly contrary to the thesis. A careful examination of the consensus reveals major weaknesses in it, and opens the way for the detailed analysis of the social policy which follows. Chapter II describes the pre-war social policy of the Council and shows how its major elements were congru- ent with a prophetic interpretation of the Christian faith. Chapter III in- vestigates the wartime social policy and indicates the ways in which it was related to the pre-war policy. Chapter IV traces the formation of the Gen- eral War-Time Commission of the Churches, which was the Council's main instrument for effecting its poli- cy. The study of the wartime views and services of Robert E. Speer, Wil- liam Adams Brown, William Douglas Mackenzie, and others which appears in Chapter V highlights the nature of the alternative point of view on the war which the Council articulated. The final three chapters of the dis- sertation are a study of the way the social policy was implemented during the war. Chapter VI shows how the War-Time Commission effected the policy in terms of calls to prayer, in- dustrial workers, Negro troops, and in a variety of other ways. Chapter VII draws the lines of the battle which the Council fought with the govern- ment on the formation of an adequate corps of chaplains. Chapter VIII de- scribes the efforts of the Council on behalf of peace and reconstruction, and shows that these themes were a part of the policy throughout the war. The work of the men mentioned above and of Frank Mason North, Charles S. Macfarland, Bishop William F. Mc- Dowell, Worth Tippy, Henry Church- ill King, and Samuel McCrea Cavert, among others, is highlighted in this study. Microfilm $5.80; Xerography $20.50. 455 pages. The Disciples of Christ and the Great Depression: 1929-1936. By William Oliver Paulsell. Vanderbilt University, 1965. Chairman: Her- man A. Norton. The purpose of this thesis is to study the relationship between the brother- hood of churches known as the Chris- tian Churches (Disciples of Christ) and the Depression of the 1930's. The study is based on four periodicals which represent the various theologi- cal and ecclesiastical points of view found in the brotherhood and the sta- tistical information in the annual brotherhood Yearbook.
