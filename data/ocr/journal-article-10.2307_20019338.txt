COLEMAN INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES1 This paper provides a methodological schema for interpreting Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion2 that supports the traditional thesis that Philo represents Hume's views on religious belief.* To understand the com? plexity of Hume's ' naturalism ' and his assessment of religious belief, it is essential to grasp the manner in which Philo articulates a consistently Humean position in the Dialogues. The traditional interpretation is problematic because, from a literary perspective, there is no reason to assume that Hume's views must be repre? sented by at most one or even at least one of the personae in the Dialogues. Indeed, the case has been made that inconsistent and un-Humean pronounce? ments are made by each of these personae, supporting the conclusion that none of them can in fact truly represent his stand on religion.3 As Bricke has argued, given Hume's self-stated desire to compose a dialogue that would be 'natural and unaffected',4 one might indeed expect that the characters of the dialogue would not be 'wholly consistent, completely clear-headed, and unmuddled throughout'.5 However, I believe that Hume is a philosopher first and a literary stylist second. If key developments in the Dialogues serve literary ends, these ends in turn serve Hume's philosophical purposes. In order to defend the traditional identification of Philo with Hume, I will show that those passages considered most problematic for this view are in fact required by Hume's philosophical assessment of the nature and limitations of religious belief. These passages include (1) Philo's appearing 'embarrassed and confounded' (D, 155) in Part III following Cleanthes' defence of the 'irregular' reasoning supporting the design argument, (2) his assent to the argument from design at the end of the Dialogues without any retraction of his earlier criticisms of its validity, and (3) his apparent support of fideism, as when he concludes that 'a person, seasoned with a just sense of the 1 An earlier version of this paper received the 1985 Richard M.

COLEMAN imperfections of natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity' (D, 227) and that ' to be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian ' (D, 228). Also problematic, assuming the identification of Philo with Hume is correct, is (4) the conclusion of the Dialogues, namely, the judgement by Pamphilus, the narrator, that the arguments of Cleanthes are ' nearer to the truth' than those of Philo.1 A systematic approach is required to explain these troublesome passages. It is not enough to say that in one place Hume is being ironic or that in another he intends only some dramatic effect, since the justification of such explanations would itself depend upon some vision of a unifying purpose that underlies seemingly inconsistent developments. A systematic approach pro? vides such a vision and is justified just to the extent that it successfully explains these developments and is consistent with Hume's basic principles laid out in his epistemological writings. The schema of interpretation I use to show that Philo represents a consistent Humean position is adapted from Hume's criticism of fallacious concepts of external existence in the Treatise of Human Nature. The advantage of this approach is two-fold. First, it provides a consistent reading of the Dialogues that does not have recourse to ad hoc speculations concerning Hume's use of literary technique. Second, it demon? strates a methodological continuity between the Dialogues, written between 1751 and 1776, the year of Hume's death, and his first work, published in I738-9 I The purpose of Hume's sceptical arguments concerning the belief in external existence is not to question whether external objects exist: "Tis in vain to ask,' wrote Hume, ' Whether there be body or not? That is a point, which we must take for granted in all our reasonings' (T, 187). The purpose of these arguments is to explain the psychological origin of this belief and to expose an unavoidable illusion which he claims attends it.2 Origin of an Illusion Belief in external existence is the belief in the continued and distinct existence of objects, i.e. the identity of objects throughout variable and interrupted 1 These are the passages most frequently cited by those who challenge the traditional view, supported by Kemp Smith, that Philo is Hume's primary spokesman in the Dialogues. Laing argued that Cleanthes is Hume's primary spokesman, Hendel argued for Pamphilus, and Bricke, as has already been mentioned, argues none is. See Norman Kemp Smith's introduction to the Dialogues, pp. 55-75; B. M. Laing, 'Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion', Philosophy xn (1937), 175-90; Charles Hendel, Studies in the Philosophy of David Hume, 2nd ed. (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963), Chaps, x-xn; and John Bricke, op. cit. A more recent example of the view that Cleanthes best represents Hume is found in Nelson Pike, ed., Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Indianapolis : Bobbs-Merrill, 1970), pp. 204-38. For a recent defence of the traditional view, see J. C. A. Gaskin, Hume's Philosophy of Religion, 2nd ed. (Macmillan Press, 1988). 2 The outline I give in this paper of Hume's account of belief in external existence is developed in greater detail in an earlier article, 'Hume's "Dialectic"', in Hume Studies x (1983), 139-55.</page><page sequence="3">INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES 181 perceptions of them (T, 199-200). Hume's theory of the origin of ideas lead him to conclude that the only empirically legitimate idea of external exist? ence we can have is of the relatedness of discrete perceptions (T, 67-8). However, Hume also maintained that belief in external existence is causally tied to the illusory idea of perfect identity among diverse perceptions. He defines perfect identity as the ' invariableness and uninterruptedness of any object, thro' a suppos'd variation of time' (T, 201). Only unchanging objects or perceptions have 'perfect identity'. Hume contrasts this concept with imperfect identity, which can be defined as a sequence of perceptions related by an appropriate degree of resemblance and causation (T, 260). Although only unchanging perceptions have perfect identity, Hume maintains that the mental operations involved in contemplating these two forms of identity are so similar that it produces the illusory belief that imperfectly identical perceptions are perfectly identical (T, 204). This phenomenon is an instance of a general rule which, basic to Hume's account of absolute space and time, necessary connection, and identity, can be counted among Hume's 'first principles ' : We may establish it for a general rule, that whatever ideas place the mind in the same disposition or in similar ones, are very apt to be confounded. The mind readily passes from one to the other, and perceives not the change without a strict attention, of which, generally speaking, 'tis wholly incapable (T, 203). Cognitive illusions resulting from this 'confounding' of mental dispositions and their related ideas are analogous to perceptual illusions. Perceptual illusions, such as a stick appearing bent in water owing to the refraction of light waves, are unavoidable in the presence of certain perceptual conditions yet are identifiable as illusions through a consideration of the effects of these conditions on the organs of sense. Consequently, while these illusions are unavoidable given the necessary perceptual conditions, deception by them is not. According to Hume, cognitive illusions, such as the perfect identity of related but variable and interrupted perceptions, have similar attributes. The confounding of perfect and imperfect identity, resulting from the resem? blance of mental states involved in apprehending objects standing in these relations, produces an illusion that is impossible ever to eradicate (T, 215). Yet reflection on the principles of mental association and the nature of perceptions allows for the detection of the contradiction in applying the concept of perfect identity to changing or distinct perceptions (T, 217). Consequently, deception by the illusion is avoidable. Hume distinguishes three cognitive attitudes relating to this illusion and the instinct that pro? duces it, namely, vulgar belief, false philosophy and true philosophy: In considering this subject we may observe a gradation of three opinions, that rise above each other, according as the persons, who form them, acquire new degrees of reason and knowledge. These opinions are that of the vulgar, that of a false</page><page sequence="4">l82 DOROTHY P. COLEMAN philosophy, and that of the true; where we shall find upon enquiry, that the true philosophy approaches nearer to the sentiments of the vulgar, than to those of mistaken knowledge (T, 222-3). Vulgar Belief False and True Philosophy The 'vulgar' or unphilosophical system of belief is a system of belief unchecked by rules of correct empirical reasoning. Consequently, vulgar reasoners fail to recognize the mind's natural illusions as illusions. Their failure to detect these illusions produces contradictions within their system of beliefs. While supposing that perceptions are their only objects, the vulgar believe in an external, mind-independent reality as a causal consequence of their confounding two types of identity (T, 209). The purpose of philosophy, according to Hume, is to detect and to remedy the contradictions in vulgar or common sense belief. 'Philosophical decisions,' he wrote, 'are nothing but the reflections of common life, methodized and corrected' (E, 162). Yet Hume distinguishes true from false philosophical systems that attempt to correct contradictions in vulgar belief. False philosophy attempts to correct the contradiction entailed by the vulgar system of belief by a doctrine of double existence according to which perceptions are mental phenomena caused by mind-independent objects that are themselves never perceived. The doctrine of double existence resolves the contradiction inherent in vulgar belief by attributing continued and distinct existence to unperceived substances or an unperceived substrate and attribu? ting variableness and discontinuity to mind-dependent perceptions. Hume maintains that this philosophical solution is a false one because knowledge of causal relations requires the observation of a constant conjunction between objects. Since such relations cannot be observed between perceptions and unperceived substances, it is not possible to infer validly the existence of objects causally productive of, and therefore distinct from, perceptions. False philosophy fails to resolve the contradiction in vulgar belief because it too succumbs to the illusion of perfect identity that generates the contradiction it purports to solve : that is, the double-existence hypothesis owes its rationale to the assumption that perceptions have a perfect identity throughout their manifold appearance (T, 213). Hume thus dismisses it as a 'palliative' remedy only. True philosophy, unlike false philosophy, does succeed in detecting the mind's illusions, but only in sustained moments of philosophical reflection (T, 269). Its influence on belief is only transitory because the mental opera? tions generating the illusion are psychologically unavoidable. Consequently, the illusion of perfect identity among diverse perceptions continues to shape experience despite its detection, much in the same way that a perceptual illusion, such as a stick appearing bent in water, persists even when percep? tual experience is interpreted correctly by reflective judgement. Even true</page><page sequence="5">INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES 183 philosophers, then, continue to experience a psychological opposition between the instinct that produces the illusion and the reflective judgement that detects it. Hume maintains that 'carelessness and in-attention' (T, 218) is the sole solution to this psychological opposition. Hume can safely recommend carelessness and inattention because the illusion of perfect identity is an innocuous one having no bearing on specific identity judgements; that is, it provides no practical assistance in assessing the conditions under which a series of diverse perceptions are to be considered as perceptions of a single object. To adapt a passage from the Treatise regarding another cognitive illusion, the idea of necessary connection, Hume might say: If we have really no idea of [the perfect identity of diverse perceptions], 'twill be to little purpose to prove, that a [perfect identity] is necessary in all [judgements of identity]. We do not understand our own meaning in talking so, but ignorantly confound ideas, which are entirely distinct from each other (T, 168). Judgements of identity, he believes, must be guided by such empirically accessible criteria as degree of alteration, continuity in alteration, and the unity of function among variable elements. Since each of these criteria admits of degrees, it is impossible to outline necessary and sufficient conditions for identity judgements. For this reason, Hume concludes that disputes about identity are merely verbal (T, 262). A Common Schema of Analysis There are obvious difficulties with Hume's account of belief in external existence. The standard criticism from Reid to the present is that he fails to distinguish, like Locke and Berkeley before him, acts of perception from their objects, concluding that immediate objects of awareness are mind-dependent perceptions. However, the validity of Hume's views is not at issue here. The point I am making is a methodological one, namely, that Hume's criticism of belief in external existence parallels his criticism of religion. Summing up what has been said so far, the salient features of Hume's criticism of belief in external existence are the following : ( 1 ) Belief in external existence is instinc tually tied to an illusory concept of identity, (2) three distinct judgements are possible concerning this illusion, one unphilosophical and mistaken, one philosophical yet also mistaken, and one philosophical and not mistaken, (3) while the illusion can be detected in philosophical reflection, it re-asserts itself when philosophical reflection ceases, and (4) the illusion has no practical bearing for making identity judgements, and so the true philosopher can harmlessly yield to it when not philosophically engaged. The remainder of this paper will show that these features of Hume's criticism of belief in external existence guide his criticism of religion. That is, it can be shown that Hume argues ( 1 ) belief in the existence of unknown causes is instinctually</page><page sequence="6">184 DOROTHY P. COLEMAN tied to an illusory concept of invisible, intelligent power, (2) vulgar belief, false philosophy, and true philosophy represent three levels of judgement concerning this illusion, (3) the illusion re-asserts itself despite detection through philosophical reflection and (4) the illusion does not provide any practical advantage for understanding the nature and existence of unknown causes. This common schema of analysis in turn sheds light on the identi? fication of Philo with Hume. II Hume maintained that, while there is a great lack of uniformity among the religions of the world, the one universal aspect of religious belief is belief in invisible, intelligent power (NHR, 37), a tehet sufficiently general to include paganism, monotheism, and deism. Hume did not maintain the belief in invisible, intelligent power is, like belief in external existence, universal and unavoidable. Indeed, he stresses the role education and custom play in its formation (D, 130, 216). Consequently, it would be a mistake to suppose that he takes belief in God to be what commentators commonly call a 'natural belief'.1 However, Hume does maintain that 'only an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances' (NHR, 26) could explain its absence. Taking religious belief to be at least nearly universal, he patterns his criticism of religious belief after his criticism of the illusory form of belief in external existence. Thus, just as he began his discussion of external existence in the Treatise saying, ' 'Tis in vain to ask, Whether there be body or not? ' so too he has each of the participants in the Dialogues, even the sceptical Philo, agree that ' the question can never be concerning the being, but only the nature of the Deity. The former truth...is unquestionable and self-evident' (D, 142). Origin of the Illusion of Invisible, Intelligent Power Because Hume does not assume that religious belief is universal, he maintains that the instincts which produce it are secondary, not original or constitutive of human nature (NHR, 25). The secondary instincts responsible for reli? gious belief are ( 1 ) the tendency to form determinate images or concepts of unknown causes in the absence of adequate empirical evidence for doing so and (2) the tendency to anthropomorphize natural phenomena (NHR, 33-4). But while religious belief arises from secondary instincts, even these are irregular operations of one that is original, namely, the instinct to inquire after an ultimate cause that would explain the regularity we observe in nature, even though the object of such inquiry proves elusive. Describing this instinct in the Treatise, Hume writes, Nothing is ever more curiously enquir'd after by the mind of man, than the causes of every phaenomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate causes, but 1 The thesis that belief in God is, for Hume, a natural belief is persuasively challenged by J. C. A. Gaskin in 'God, Hume and Natural Belief, Philosophy xlix (1984), 281-94.</page><page sequence="7">INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES 185 push on our enquires, till we arrive at the original and ultimate principle_This is our aim in all our studies and reflections : And how we must be disappointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or energy lies merely in ourselves, and is nothing but that determination of the mind, which is acquir'd by custom (T, 266). Concerning the influence of secondary instincts on belief, Hume distin? guishes three levels of judgement, just as he distinguished three judgements pertaining to the concept of external existence, one representing the vulgar system of belief, the second, false philosophy, and the third, true philosophy. These three forms of judgement are represented in the Dialogues by Demea, Cleanthes, and Philo.1 Vulgar, False and True Religion In the Natural History of Religion Hume characterizes the origin of'vulgar ' or unphilosophical religion as the alliance of hope and fear with the desire to ascertain the nature of unknown causes (NHR, 33). In the Dialogues, Demea is the advocate of this vulgar religion. While initially putting forward a priori, philosophical proofs for the existence of God in the early stages of the Dialogues, he readily abandons these arguments once they are attacked by Cleanthes and Philo. Demea is not really a philosopher; he uses philosophical arguments only when they appear to support his dogmatic religious views. The real basis for religious belief, Hume has him openly concede, is not reason, but hope and fear: It is my opinion, I own, ...that each man feels, in a manner, the truth of religion within his own breast ; and from a consciousness of his imbecility and misery, rather than from any reasoning, is led to seek protection from that Being, on whom he and all of nature is dependent. So anxious or so tedious are even the best scenes of life, that futurity is still the object of all our hopes and fears. We incessantly look forward, and endeavour, by prayers, adoration, and sacrifice, to appease those unknown powers, whom we find, by experience, so able to afflict and oppress us (D, 193). By vulgar religion Hume means all those forms of theism whose specu? lations regarding invisible power are not regulated by philosophical reflec? tion. Unphilosophical theists believe that the existence and nature of divine power can be known only through divine revelation, not through reason. While agreeing with vulgar theists that knowledge of divine nature surpasses the limits of human reason, Hume rejects the view that such knowledge can be acquired through revelation. Vulgar religion, he maintains, because it 1 A similar thesis is advanced by Michael Pakaluk in 'Philosophical Types in Hume's Dialogues', in Philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, ed. V. Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1984), pp. 116-32. Pakaluk, like myself, argues that 'Philo is a true philosopher, Cleanthes, a false philosopher, and Demea a vulgar reasoner', p. 120. Whereas I support this thesis by outlining a methodological structure common to the Dialogues and Hume's account of external existence in the Treatise, Pakaluk supports his interpretation through an examination of different philosophical types described in Hume's popular essays and of different species of scepticism delineated in the Enquiry. The two approaches make a good case for the continuity between the Treatise and the Enquiry, contrary to those who believe the Enquiry marks a new direction in Hume's thinking.</page><page sequence="8">186 DOROTHY P. COLEMAN proceeds unchecked by philosophical reflection, generates a contradictory system of beliefs. In the Natural History of Religion, he criticizes revealed religion primarily on two grounds. First, vulgar theists, while maintaining that divine nature surpasses human nature in all aspects, inconsistently attribute anthropomorphic qualities to divine nature in order to form a determinate understanding of it. Second, they attribute these human quali? ties and passions to divine power arbitrarily, selecting those qualities that satisfy human hopes and quell human fears. These criticisms are reflected in the Dialogues when, mocking Demea's pious attribution of moral qualities to this unknowable divinity, Philo remarks: It is an absurdity to believe that the Deity has human passions, and one of the lowest of human passions, a restless appetite for applause. It is an inconsistency to believe, that, since the Deity has this human passion, he has not others also; and, in particular, a disregard to the opinions of creatures so much inferior (D, 226). Philosophical religion is nothing but vulgar religion, methodized and corrected. It shares with vulgar religion the same natural instinct to form a determinate, anthropomorphic concept of invisible power, but at the same time moderates its influence by following non-arbitrary rules of causal and analogical inference. Just as Hume distinguished between true and false judgements regarding external existence, so too he distinguishes, in the persons of Philo and Cleanthes, true from false reasoning about the unknown cause of order in nature. Cleanthes argues that the nature of this ultimate cause must be like mind or thought. I will not go into the details of Philo's criticisms of this argument. Their main thrust is that any attempt to prove the existence and nature of God based on empirical reasoning involves an illegitimate extension of empirical reasoning. Philo also suggests that the persuasiveness of any philo? sophical defence of religious belief depends, not on logical cogency, but on the same instinctual responses which lead vulgar religion to its anthropo? morphic concept of divine power, namely, hope and fear regarding the unknown (D, 225). The causal arguments of false philosophical religion provide only an illusion of reasoning about invisible power in a rational way. The true philosopher, on the other hand, acknowledges that the methods of empirical reasoning employed by natural theology can prove neither the existence nor nature of an ultimate cause. Yet even the true philosopher is influenced by the instinctual, even if not rational, basis for religious belief. Consequently, when suspending philosophical scrutiny of the merits of the argument from design, even Philo, the sceptic, affirms at the end of the Dialogues that a supreme, intelligent-like cause of nature exists (D, 214-15). His susceptibility to irregular instincts sustaining analogical inference concerning the nature of ultimate causes notwithstanding, Philo's 'assent' to Cleanthes' argument concedes very little to the theistic cause. Explaining his ' unfeigned sentiments ' concerning ' true religion ' (D, 219) in Part XII, Philo</page><page sequence="9">INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES 187 maintains that the argument from design is innocuous enough so as to reduce the disagreement between the theist and the atheist to a verbal dispute.1 Both can agree that the ' cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence' (D, 227) because this propo? sition would hold true whether the ultimate cause of order is a principle inherent in matter or an immaterial, intelligent force transcending nature. Just as the illusory concept of perfect identity provides no empirically access? ible criteria for making judgements of identity, the idea of an intelligent like ultimate cause furnishes no specific understanding of ultimate causation that has consequences for human conduct. Since Cleanthes' analogy cannot show that this ultimate cause is likely to be any more analogous to 'the structure of human thought' than is 'the rotting of a turnip' (D, 218), the argument from design, Philo concludes, can ' afford no inference that affects human life' (D, 227). Thus, like mistaken judgements concerning perfect identity, the judgement that an intelligent-like cause of nature exists is an error to which the true philosopher may harmlessly acquiesce when ' nature ' relaxes his philosophical bent of mind (T, 269). At the same time yielding to human nature's irregular instincts, the true philosopher is aware of the vacuity of the speculative proposition to which they lead. Explaining the Paradoxes of Part XII This outline of Hume's account of the different levels of religious belief accounts for the unexpected developments in Part XII. Philo's 'confession of faith ' at the end of the Dialogues, though seemingly sudden, is anticipated as early as Part III where he is described by the narrator, Pamphilus, as being 'a little embarrassed and confounded' (D, 155) following Cleanthes' defence of the admittedly 'irregular' inference involved in his argument from design. Philo is embarrassed and confounded because Cleanthes has shifted the nature of his argument. Philo had been criticizing Cleanthes' thesis that belief in an intelligent author of nature can be proven by empirical reasoning alone, whereas at this point Cleanthes stresses its basis in 'common sense and the plain instincts of nature' (D, 154), maintaining that even if the argument from design was 'contradictory to the principles of logic', our natural instincts compel us to accept it (D, 155). Philo is confounded because, while he can speak against errors in reasoning, he cannot speak against the influence of instinct.2 For the same reason, at the end of the Dialogues Philo 1 That Philo speaks here for Hume receives confirmation within the text itself where Hume, speaking in his own voice in a footnote, similarly asserts that the dispute between sceptics and dogmatists ' is entirley verbal' (D, 219). Noxon, however, argues that there is a significant difference between their remarks on this subject. I find the difference too subtle to cast any doubt on the identity of Hume's views and Philo's. See James Noxon, 'Hume's Agnosticism' in Hume: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. V. C. Chappell (University of Notre Dame Press, 1968), p. 379. 2 Nelson Pike argues that Philo is described as ' confounded and confused ' because the argument for design provides justifiable, even if irregular, grounds for religious belief. For a convincing criticism of this view, see Bricke, pp. 8-11. However, I believe Bricke wrongly dismisses the significance of this passage by maintaining that its function is merely literary.</page><page sequence="10">188 DOROTHY P. COLEMAN can affirm the psychological inevitability of conclusions of Cleanthes' argument without retracting any of his earlier objections to the logical cogency of the argument. In light of the limitations Philo places on true religion that reduce the disagreement between theist and atheist to a verbal altercation, Philo's confession of faith is not only fully consistent with the sceptical arguments preceding Part XII, but indeed, their logical outcome. For these arguments taken together show the futility of any attempt to form a determinate understanding of the nature of ultimate causation. Philo can maintain that his 'veneration for true religion', as expressed in Part XII, is proportionate to his 'abhorrence of vulgar superstitions' (D, 219), passionately articulated in Parts I?XI, because to practise true religion is just to be sceptical of any attempt to assign any specific content to the idea of an ultimate cause. Thus Philo can say in earnest, though also with intended ambiguity, that ' to be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian' (D, 228, emphasis added). Philo's characterization of true religion directly opposes that given by Cleanthes, who invites the 'corrupt' alliance between vulgar religion and philosophy. 'Genuine theism,' Cleanthes urges, represents us as the workmanship of a Being perfectly good, wise, and powerful ; who created us for happiness, and who, having implanted in us immeasurable desires of good, will prolong our existence to all eternity, and will transfer us into an infinite variety of scenes, in order to satisfy those desires, and render our felicity complete and durable (D, 224). To Philo's objection that the introduction of such tenets as immortality and divine providence corrupts true religion, Cleanthes protests that 'reli? gion, however corrupted... is so strong and necessary a security to morals, that we ought never to abandon or neglect it' (D, 219).1 Yet history, Philo retorts, belies the alleged salutary effects of'vulgar superstition' (D, 220). Cleanthes, he urges, fails to detect the true instincts generating vulgar 1 In the Enquiry, sec. XI, Hume appears to take the view of Cleanthes rather than of Philo, arguing that religious belief has a good moral effect : Men... draw many consequences from the belief of divine Existence, and suppose that the Deity will inflict punishments on vice, and bestow rewards on virtue_Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not, is no matter. Its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And, those, who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may... be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians. (E, 147) I am inclined to agree with Noxon's assessment that 'the chapter gives so strong an impression of being contrived ' that one hesitates to accept this statement at face value, particularly in light of Hume's ambiguous remark that the sceptical position that he is opposing (and which agrees with Philo's) embraces 'those principles, to which I have always expressed a particular attachment' (E, 142). See Noxon, p. 371. Hume speaks directly and without ambiguity on this topic in the Natural History of Religion where he clearly takes the side of Philo: 'The greatest crimes have been found, in many instances compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion : Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any certain inference in favour of a man's morals from the fervour or strictness of his religious exercises' (NHR, Chap. IV).</page><page sequence="11">INTERPRETING HUME'S DIALOGUES 189 religion, and, in turn, the corrupt alliance of philosophy with superstition : it is not the lofty imperative to 'regulate the heart of men' that brings people to think of religion, but the fear of adverse fortune and hope of deliverance therefrom (D, 225). For the very reason that true religion affords no inference that affects human life, its salutary effect on vulgar religion is a tenuous one. Indeed, Philo pessimistically declares that only those possessing a true philosophical disposition in the first place will modify their conduct and beliefs accordingly. Its influence thus has the disadvantage of being 'always confined to very few persons' (D, 223). On the other hand, those who are more 'well-disposed' to the influence of instinct than to the guide of reason will, upon discovering the vacuity of philosophical religion, abandon philosophy in favour of revelation. Thus, Philo: Believe me, Cleanthes, the most natural sentiment, which a well-disposed mind will feel on this occasion, is a longing desire and expectation, that Heaven would be pleased to dissipate, at least alleviate, this profound ignorance, by affording some more particular revelation to mankind_A person, seasoned with a just sense of the imperfections of natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity (D,227). This passage is not to be read, as Bricke maintained, as an inconsistent endorsement of revelation by Philo,1 nor is it merely, as Kemp Smith has suggested, a 'conventionally prescribed avowal that the disabilities of reason only make revelation and faith more needful'.2 The passage is the result of Hume's view that 'only an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances' (NHR, 26) can overcome the instinct to form unwarranted determinate concepts of divine power. For all but a philosophical few who can remain content with a theism that is for all practical purposes devoid of practical significance, philosophical religion encourages a flight back to revelation to satisfy human hopes and fears. Because it permits, even insists on, this turn to revelation, Cleanthes' version of philosophical theism, Hume perceives, will always be more readily received among vulgar reasoners than Philo's (that is, Hume's own). These reflections concerning the salutary effects of true and false philosophy, I believe, explain the final comment by the young Pamphilus, whose philo? sophical education is only just beginning, that 'upon a review of the whole', he 'cannot but think' that the views of Cleanthes, rather than those of Philo, approach 'nearer to the truth' (D, 228). For whatever literary or cautionary motives Hume may have had in choosing to conclude the Dialogues in this manner, Pamphilus' statement can be interpreted in a Humean way in at least two respects. First, Cleanthes' principles approach 'nearer to the truth' in the sense that our natural instincts incline us to reason in the way 1 Bricke, 7-8. 2 Kemp Smith, p. 63.</page><page sequence="12">19O DOROTHY P. COLEMAN Cleanthes describes. Philo's objections to Cleanthes' argument from design, though logically sound, are too ' abstruse ' and strain these instincts too much to appeal to 'common' sense. Second, because Cleanthes' natural theology accords with natural instincts, his philosophy, not Philo's, is more apt to influence public opinion. The closing statement of Pamphilus' narration, I believe, is best read in light of Hume's remark in the introduction to the Enquiry : It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and abstruse; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agreeable, but more useful than the other (E.6-7).
