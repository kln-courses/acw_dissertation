<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Semiotics of Alterity: A Comparison with Hermeneutics* Peter Haidu N SPITE of general suppositions about the nature of the semiotic enterprise, these comments will be situated, oriented, and ex- ploratory. They are produced by a medievalist, a specialist of a domain whose problematic is far from being constituted exclusively by contemporary semiotics. This discourse, therefore, will be a displaced or a decentered discourse, undertaking a dialogue with a position other than that of semiotics, specifically a particular form of hermeneutics. It is produced at the intersection of two currents of research which are - hopefully - interdependent and comple- mentary: the analysis of medieval texts as historical phenomena, and the development of a sociohistorical semiotics which would claim to account for these analyses. If this be schizophrenia, so be it. Reading medieval texts produces an anomalous situation for the professional reader: most contemporary interpretative or analytic presuppositions are suddenly put into question. The linguistic or semiotic codes, simultaneously cultural and historical, which were constitutive of the texts at their composition, are very different from the codes which constitute a contemporary lectorial competence. That is the phenomenon addressed as "alterity." Applied to medieval problematics, the term goes back to the discussions which surrounded the publication of Paul Zumthor's Essai de podtique midiivale in 1972. Hans Robert Jauss gave the term broader currency in a well-known essay-which appeared in an English translation in this journal- and which also gave its title to the book in which it was published.' Jauss's theory of reception, as is well known, invokes as its philosophic base Hans Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics.2 It is this combined structure of thought I will first address, in order to then develop *This text was originally read to a colloquium on Description in the Social Sciences held at Cerisy-la-Salle in September 1986, under the title "La S6miotique de l'alt6rit6: Tentative de r6habilitation du vouvoiement"; the present translation is by the author.</page><page sequence="2">672 NEW LITERARY HISTORY a semiotics of alterity. I will acknowledge some embarrassment: without being a philosopher, I will be doing-or at least speaking- philosophy. In fact, I will speak philosophy by transgression, with the excuse that the issue is too important to let it develop only in the hands of specialists! I. Hermeneutics and Alterity Historically, structuralism and hermeneutics share a phenome- nological heritage which, in the case of the structuralism of the fifties and sixties, combined with a scientific theory of indeterminacy in micronuclear research associated with the name of Werner Von Heisenberg. In both cases, the determination of the object of knowl- edge by the cognitive subject becomes a central element of the epistemological theory. The hermeneutic version of this determi- nation affirms the historicity of the text and of the reader-an affirmation I make my own, whose validity seems to me demonstrated by the brilliant success of semiotics itself. Without touching upon the substance of the history of the School of Paris, one cannot but be impressed by the continuous development of new theoretical components produced by its relations, perhaps dialectical, with two different series: that of the textual objects, that of other forms of theory.3 Parenthetically, I believe it would be extremely useful to undertake a serious historiography of semiotics, of the discipline's internal and external development, a historiography somewhat more serious and attentive to the research group constituted around the figure of Algirdas Julien Greimas than the parodistic and prejudicial history that dismisses semiotics-and the other forms of structur- alism-as surpassed by the critiques of deconstruction. Such a his- toriography would stress the very apparition of contemporary se- miotics as a marked phenomenon; it would stress the historicity of this phenomenon, a historicity first demonstrated by Greimas himself in the beginning pages of Structural Semantics more than twenty years ago, where he demonstrates openly the transformations wrought upon earlier forms of linguistics and narratology. Stressing this historicity does not for a moment deny the phenomenon's discontinuity: on the contrary, this discontinuity, this disjunction, is the very form of history and its evenementiality. In hermeneutics, subject and object are related by a key term: "tradition." With Gadamer and Jauss, tradition takes the shape of an uninterrupted dialogue, a dialogue continuous from one text to another in the form of question and answer, each text producing an answer to the question asked, overtly or implicitly, by an earlier</page><page sequence="3">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 673 text. This series of questions and answers constitutes the "tradition," which becomes the condition of possibility of the cognitive relation between text and reader. The reader, as cognitive subject, is con- stituted by the tradition which leads up to his or her very presence, connecting that presence to the diachronic series of anterior texts which compose among themselves the complex roles of the dialogue: dialogued as well as dialoguing, each text performing both roles of interlocution: questioner as well as respondent. Hermeneutics openly recognizes the circularity of this cognition in recognizing the his- toricity of the reader: the "tradition" transforms itself, incorporating both text and reader in a circular epistemology which a traditional empiricism would label "vicious" but which seems to constitute one of the essential epistemological paradoxes of contemporary scientific and philosophical thought. 1. "Question-and-answer" as the form of the "tradition" The representation of the "tradition" as a dialogue is obviously a metaphor. Texts do "speak," but without speaking. The metaphor, however, is not simply an ornament. As a metaphor, it tropes a new conceptual content. Here, it imports anthropomorphism into the relationship of text and decoder. Where a direct description would see a human actor deciphering a series of graphisms thanks to the play of linguistic, semiotic, and encyclopedic codes, the met- aphor of question and answer institutes a conversation between two actors, a conversation of high culture, philosophical subtlety, and above all, a conversation based on the adherence of the two actors to common codes, with their foundational significations and refer- ences. I observe that Bakhtin used exactly the same technique in his criticism of Saussurian linguistic formalism, opposing to that formalism the fluidity of conversational speech.4 In both cases, Gadamer-Jauss and Bakhtin, writing (in the pre-Derridean sense) is identified with spoken language, invoking the characteristics of spoken speech when the subject is written texts. The difference is important. As Socrates had already suggested, the living interlocutor is capable of defending himself, while writing cannot. The reply, the snappy comeback, or just correction by the one addressed, are impossible for the written text. The supposed dialogue form of the "tradition" is a dramatization, the actorialization and the anthropomorphization, of an interior monologue, that of the particular reader. As soon as one accepts- as did Levi-Strauss, as does semiotics, as does, in fact, Jauss himself-</page><page sequence="4">674 NEW LITERARY HISTORY that the meaning or signification of the text is not necessarily enunciated by the text itself, one is forced to recognize that its thematization can only be produced by the reader. It is therefore the reader who formulates the question posed him or her by the text, as well as the answer he or she gives to the question formulated in order to attribute it to the false character that is the text. The dialogue form of the "tradition" is a metaphor: it is equally well a narrative fiction. Jauss's reception theory displaces the problem of reading in any case. Rather than reading primary texts, it proposes reading texts relating the reactions of historical readers when reading those pri- mary texts. Reading metatexts is substituted for reading texts. There- fore, a theory of genres has to be developed before the act of reading. Would such a theory of textual genres be inscribed in the objective realities of texts? Not only does such a postulation fit uneasily in the phenomenological heritage of hermeneutics, it fits just as uneasily into the semiotic experience which finds the same textual functionings in metatexts as in supposedly "primary" texts. In fact, the interpretation or analysis of metatexts is not less prob- lematic than that of primary texts. In both cases, the reader must decide whether or not to accept the phenomenological givens of the act of reading, or whether it is necessary to have recourse to formalization. The reader is therefore once again faced with the same alternative which had originally determined the research tra- jectory-that is, with the beginnings of theoretical reflection. What has been achieved in the meanwhile is the evacuation of reading, its emptying, the voidance of the encounter of reader with an object of knowledge that had initially intrigued him or her. The effect of reception theory turns out to be the evaporation both of interpretation and of analysis, their displacement, or to use the Derridean term, their permanent diffirance. In fact, there is no Aufhebung of the problem of reading, but a return to Plato's cave, in which the images on the wall are projected from behind the spectator, who is impressed by the cinematographic effet de rdel. The difference is that in the case of reception theory, the illusioned audience and the illusion-producing projector are conjoined in a perfect actorial syncretism. Applying reception theory to the Middle Ages, I note that pertinent metatexts are almost totally lacking. The habit of writing down personal reactions to individual readings--whether in reviews, di- aries, or works of literary criticism-did not exist during the Middle Ages. What has come down to us are two groups of texts: important treatises on grammar and rhetoric, written in Latin, addressing</page><page sequence="5">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 675 themselves to Latin, classical writing; and the repetitive condem- nations of any and all reading in the vulgar languages by men of the Church preoccupied by their fears for the salvation of the youthful souls whose education they supervised, the acolytes pre- paring themselves for the tonsure. Absent metatexts, is hermeneutic reading of medieval textuality possible? 2. The continuity of the "tradition" With Gadamer and with Jauss, the continuity of the tradition is fundamental. It is its uninterrupted continuity which constitutes the guarantee of lectorial competence, since the roles of "reader" and "text" are reciprocally constituted as the two ends of the episte- mological chain. It is continuity that guarantees the adequation of one term to the other. Interruption, discontinuity, would break the constitutive bond between text and reader: the act of reading would suddenly be handed over to indeterminacy. This is where one runs into an unfortunate paradox. Or rather, it is Jauss who runs into it. Not only is Jauss a theoretician of literature, and a very successful one at that, Jauss is also the greatest living medievalist in the field of French literature working in Ger- many. The paradox is that he has produced a general theory of literature whose application to the field of medieval literature is most doubtful. Not only are the metatexts which are the preferred object of reception theory missing, the continuity of the "tradition" is equally missing. In France, between the Renaissance which rejected medieval literature en bloc, and a romanticism which rediscovered and reinvented it, the texts of the Middle Ages were hardly read (with exceptions, of course: no one will doubt their exceptional status). French literary history comprises a radical discontinuity: a cut of about three centuries interrupts textual contact with the Middle Ages. Jauss's theory, and the assertion of a necessary con- tinuity in the "tradition," a continuity constitutive of literary knowl- edge, should render nugatory Jauss's second specialization as a medievalist. 3. The presumed unity of the "tradition" This trait is specified neither by Gadamer nor by Jauss: it is essential to both, however, on both methodological and ideological levels. It operates as an assumption or presupposition. Since the</page><page sequence="6">676 NEW LITERARY HISTORY point of the "tradition" is to unite in a single cognitive field the functions of subject and object, the postulate of unicity seems per- fectly natural. In Gadamer, its content is named: it is nothing other than the valorization of what used to be called "humanism," and sometimes even "the Judeo-Christian tradition" (let me note that this phrase is almost always produced in Christian thought, in which the first element is subsumed by the second). Jauss, more aware than Gadamer of the evolution of modern thought, and especially of literary modernism, recognizes that it is not a simple affirmation of Christian faith that cognitive bridges will be built to medieval works. This observation might have led far; unfortunately, its effects remain highly circumscribed. The fact is that the interpretation/ analysis of medieval texts is enormously varied, on both sides of the Atlantic. This undoubtedly reproduces the conditions normal in contemporary literary or textual research. The variability of models of analysis produces equally varied "readings" of concrete texts. Intellectual culture is no different from other social domains; it is a locus of competition and conflict, whose debates are perhaps less bloody than others . . . but only "perhaps"! Medieval society, as well as the modern, is a differentiated society, therefore a complex society: to postulate a single, unified tradition, unified in its cultural productions or in its modern interpretations, is perfect nonsense, belied by observable fact. Not only does the tradition include a plurality of traditions, the field of culture is itself a field of complex and continuous encounters and engagements. In its postulate of unicity, Gadamerian hermeneutics attempts rather paradoxically to attain a transhistorical position even in af- firming the historicity of its terms. But this effort toward a tran- scendence which would contradict the historicity of text and reader originally acknowledged is a fairly costly hope. On the one hand, the effort continues an entirely admirable German tradition, that of Curtius and Auerbach, who require no praise at this time: the ideal of an integrative comprehension of European culture, the effort to integrate the past in the present, is not a new invention. If it has its admirable side, it also presents something of a problem. Neither Gadamer nor, as far as I know, Jauss, has addressed himself to the problem posed for such a unifying, integrative theory by the fascist period that both experienced. It is certainly admirable to integrate Racine, Goethe, and Baudelaire in a tradition that con- stitutes us all as cognitive subjects endowed with a trans-European heritage: Will one easily do so with Ezra Pound and Leni Riefenstahl, to name only very great artists? Will one easily do the same with popular Nazi culture, there where it shades over into Nazi prop-</page><page sequence="7">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 677 aganda? Would one not want to leave open the possibility that certain aspects or Momente of the "tradition" are to be rejected, that the postulate of unity, of continuity, of integration, requires certain distinctions that imply differentiations within this "tradition"? The simple, naive, euphoric valorization of a totalized European culture hardly seems acceptable after the Holocaust, not to mention the Crusades. 4. Aesthetic pleasure Jauss insists on the role of pleasure. One might wish to believe in a post-Freudian liberation, possibly Marcusian, in a force com- parable to that which, towards the end, Foucault called the plebs, rebelling against structures, institutions, oppressive bonds. One might wish . . . nothing of the sort! The aesthetic, accepted by Jauss as a given of and for his own research even as he recognizes it to be an invention of the eighteenth century, is the attribute of a pleasure that has nothing to do with any insurrectional force. On the contrary, the aesthetic pleasure on which Jauss insists and which furnishes, not only a supplement to healthy activity as in Aristotle, but the very foundation of hermeneutic activity, remains locked within the framework of well-established systems of value. The pleasure in- dicated by Jauss can only be the limitative pleasure of the recognition of the Same in the hermeneutic circle. At the desired cultural intensity, aesthetic pleasure is only the reaction to a reciprocal validation of reader and text. The reader finds in the text what the tradition, which connects and constitutes them in their reci- procity, has already imparted to him of what is to be found in the text. It cannot be the pleasure of discovery, it cannot in any way be produced by the encounter with an Alterity that is really other. It is the pleasure of repetition at the mirror stage: one smiles at one's own reflection before the Wiederspiegelung, the reflection of oneself. That is Jaussian pleasure at the desired or intended cultural level. Besides that, there is-all too often-the simple student's mistake, which all teachers are well acquainted with: the pleasure of a naivete which, without the cultural and intellectual baggage characteristic of Jauss, simply projects its own values, its own as- sumptions, on the screen of the text, even if this implies flattening out all the distinctive traits that might make of it a complex signifier of alterity. But this ignorant pleasure does resemble Jauss's pleasure in one way. Whether at the high level of an elitist European culture, or at the ignorant level of simple, unmediated pleasure, it is the</page><page sequence="8">678 NEW LITERARY HISTORY pleasure of reducing the Other to the Same, the reduction of difference to identity, the pleasure of subordinating the other to the domination I exercise over him or her. It is sad-and saddening- to have to repeat it after World War II: pleasure is proof not of goodness, of beauty, or of comprehension. Men and women are capable of taking pleasure in the plenitude of ignorance as well as in their most horrifying acts. 5. Hermeneutic lacunae As stated earlier, not being a philosopher, I make no claim to performing a properly philosophical critique. The specification of lacunae I find in hermeneutics results from a particular orientation, an orientation which has led me toward the development of a sociohistorical semiotics. With this acknowledgement, let me end my criticism of hermeneutics and its literary adaptation, as represented by Gadamar and Jauss, by defining three major lacunae. First, hermeneutics lacks not only a theory of the text, but-as paradoxical as this may seem-the very recognition of the existence of the text. Reception theory offers an escape from reading texts by admitting the reactions of other readers as a substitute for the encounter of the text and the particular reader in question. It is undoubtedly this characteristic which explains that Jauss, in spite of encyclopedic knowledge, great cultural subtlety, and an attentive ear to the theoretical developments of his epoch, has never developed new reinterpretations of the medieval texts he has worked on. His discussions remain abstract and do not change the semantic or aesthetic values attributed to those medieval texts by the tradition. How could they? This is not a new criticism. Jauss has tried to answer it by combining a properly textual analysis with a history of reception. Without suggesting any judgment at all of the analyses he offers, let me only note the methodological redundancy: if a reading of the text which is independent of its reception is possible, then do we need a theory of reception? Did not reception theory base itself on a recognition of the ineluctable historicity of the two terms of any reading, the reader and the text? To combine textual analysis and a history of the reception of texts, does that not lead to an eclecticism constituted by a methodological oxymoron? The second lacuna to be noted concerns the historicity of the reader. As noted above, I accept this point entirely. Indeed, my criticism is that it has not been taken seriously enough by Gadamer</page><page sequence="9">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 679 and especially by Jauss himself. But no reader is constituted as reader exclusively by a literary tradition: Is it still possible to believe today in the purity of aesthetic experience? The entire historical experience of the reader--economic, social, political, as well as intellectual and artistic-is imbricated in his lectorial activity by the project of semiotic decoding. The same is true for the other her- meneutic term: no more than the reader is the text an entity belonging exclusively to the genre of "literature." It is impossibre to understand any text of the twelfth century, be it a warrior epic or a courtly lyric exemplifying the grand chant courtois (the textual type that can be considered the most abstract, the most distant from any mimetic realism), without reference to the relations of domi- nation and subordination, to reciprocally determined duties and responsibilities, outside of the texts called "literary," which are es- sential elements of feudalism. These are relations that are simul- taneously military, political, social, cultural, and semiotic, implicit in the texts, necessary to their decoding, and undefinable on the exclusive basis of the so-called "literary" text. The third lacuna was already implicit in several of my comments. Gadamer's hermeneutics and Jauss's reception theory are both prod- ucts of European intellectual history and limit themselves to a purely European diachrony. Even within this diachrony, certain moments become illegible in terms of this hermeneutics, either by under- or overcoding. Far more serious is the fact that such a theory of reading and knowledge does not even come close to dealing with the prob- lematics of all those many textualities which do not belong to this Eurocentric domain. This hermeneutics entails a categorical refusal of the twentieth century's anthropological adventure, of the effort to address forms of thought, culture, and semiosis produced beyond the territorial boundaries of Old Europe-or its renewed forms in other geographical locations. Despite the principles elaborated with such finesse, subtlety, and accumulated knowledge, everything said, written, and produced as non-European culture remains necessarily inaccessible to hermeneutics. In spite of certain of Jauss's reactions, especially to the publication of Zumthor's Essai de podtique midi"vale, the fact is that what hermeneutics cannot incorporate-in the forms of Gadamer's philosophy and Jauss's literary theory-is the thought of Alterity, in the strong sense of the word. II. The Semiotics of Alterity The relevance of a problematics of alterity for medievalism is obvious: its relevance, however, is hardly limited to that discipline.</page><page sequence="10">680 NEW LITERARY HISTORY On the one hand, alterity is a philosopheme that is fundamental in its determination of certain aspects of philosophy.5 On the other hand, the category is constitutive for several disciplines, including anthropology and semiotics. In fact, any discipline that proposes any formalism whatever presupposes alterity. At least in the human sciences, formalism is a sign--perhaps the sign--of alterity. Formalism is also a response and constitution of alterity. It responds to the recognition of cognitive alterity by developing formal rules to ne- gotiate with the entity marked by alterity, and it simultaneously constitutes the relations that will characterize the knower and the known (insofar as these terms can still be used). As such, the role of alterity as a methodological prime is recognized by the "dictionary" of semiotics, along with its contrary, "identity," as undefinables.6 Though undefinable, these terms can nonetheless be discussed: analogy and exemplarity are two ways of approaching the undefin- able. They belong, after all, to a semantic micro-universe. In my discussion, I will substitute for "identity" another term, one less common and hence less burdened with ideological connotations: ipseity. Not all binarisms lend themselves to useful quadrature. I believe the ensuing discussion will demonstrate the necessity-or at least the desirability-of the semiotic square of alterity. In this square, the orientation of the deixies is not automatic. A taste for exoticism, for instance, if one took it seriously, could eventually reverse the distribution to be proposed: I expect to hear moans from fans of science fiction and Pierre Loti! In any case, the most common historical experience, I believe, suggests locating Sameness at the euphoric position, Otherness at the dysphoric: ipseity alterity sI s2 s-2 S nonalterity nonipseity</page><page sequence="11">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 681 For the moment, the purely formal slots of the subcontraries will be left "empty," with only their functional negation of the positive terms entered. An example of the relations posited by this structure is useful. I will draw on a well-known example from the field of linguistics: Emile Benveniste's discussion of personal pronouns. As is well known, Benveniste considers je and tu as the true personal pronouns: "he" (along with "she" and "it") represents only the category of the nonpersonal, the one who is absent from the scene.' "He" was obviously born to be the "Other"!: ipseity alterity S1 S2 I he [thou] (-------) S-2 S-I nonalterity nonipseity The euphoric axis (s' - s-2) contains those relations which Benveniste considered properly "personal." The real, concrete speech act con- stitutes an immediate and inclusive community of presence, insofar as the interlocutors share the same linguistic codes. Simultaneously, the same speech act institutionalizes this community: it is the com- munity's act of incorporation. The dysphoric axis (s2 - s-') is that of nonpersonality, represented in Benveniste's discussion only by il. The position of alterity is that of the pronouns representing beings absent from immediate inter- locution, from this small intersubjective community I have indicated as euphoric. But a fourth position is possible, which consists of treating a person in the mode of nonpersonality in spite of that person's immediate, corporeal presence. It is a linguistic form that recognizes corporeal presence without granting it the full and rec- ognized presence of the "thou." Politeness is a formula for recog-</page><page sequence="12">682 NEW LITERARY HISTORY nizing nonintimate presence, a logical position which, in reference to the euphoric axis, is that of a present alterity. The "he" is the representation, within an intersubjective and interlocutory relation, of an excluded third; the "you"-the dominant form in English, but secondary and subordinate to the intimate "thou" in French, where it holds interlocutors at a distance-the polite "you" represents the inclusion of alterity, and the fact of being interlocuted in a communicative situation which is not that of "full intersubjectivity." In such a communicative situation, it is not full subjectivities that are deployed by the formalized language, but "roles" in the soci- ological and semiotic senses. The "you" is a "he" with whom one speaks nevertheless! Even at this (early) point in our analysis, the process of formal- ization has already produced an interesting effect: it is possible to view the two different languages, French and English, as mutually defining certain characteristics of the other. My discourse, importing into the English in which it is cast mental categories drawn from French, is endowed by the process of formalization with a perspective, or a point of view, which is not limited to that of either of those languages. From another point of view (defined by s'), the "you" is a potential "thou." In order to actualize this transformation, the personal ref- erent has to pass through the relation with the "I" of s'. The transformation "you" "thou" goes, first, through the negation of the socially predefined, and second through the relation of implication that relates (s') and (s-2) . This semantic effect is purely ideological. The I-thou relation is not less socialized, is not less determined, than the relation I-you: transcendence will not be brought about by the use of a particular linguistic form! The difference, in fact, is that these determinations are overtly recognized, and nearly named, by the use of the "you," while the intimacy of the tu tends to mask the social, historical, and ideological parameters of a relationship. In English, as distinguished from French, where such effusions and even the very name of the emotion are considered de trop, as sentimental, that masking is performed by the discourses of love, self, and interiority. Let this distribution of the personal pronouns of the semiotic square of alterity-whose terms remained undefined, if no longer unexplored--serve as a first sketch of the cognitive relations between text and reader.</page><page sequence="13">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 683 1. A limitative comment In a recent discussion, the postulate of an "Entirely Other" was several times raised.8 Two interpretations of this expression are possible. In the context of occidental philosophy, the "Entirely Other" designates a substance (in the Aristotelian sense) simultaneously irreducible to the substance of the enunciator and unknowable precisely because of the radical difference between the two sub- stances. God and man are so different that man cannot formulate a positive discourse regarding that other substance. Hence the necessity for a negative theology, basing itself on the inability of man to say that which he is not. The "Entirely Other," in this sense, is not absent from Derrida's thought, nor that of Levinas, to whom Derrida openly acknowledges his debt. Derrida also recognizes that this definition of alterity as absolute necessarily prevents any move- ment, any modification of the relation between the two interlocutors. Thinking about an "Entirely Other," in this sense, is the business of theology-to which I lay no claim whatever. Its object, as noted, is a substance, a "being," which belongs to and remains in a given ontological category permanently. This "being" is not my concern. The "Entirely Other," however, allows for a second interpretation o. ne quite different. This second interpretation designates the irreducible quality of the interlocutor insofar as he or she remains another person, independent of the "I" which looks at him or her, speaks, and considers his or her responses or gestures. The inter- locuted always retains this quality which differentiates him or her from the "I" who is speaking, and which is the quality of being an "I" in turn. One condition is necessary: this potential, which as Benveniste argued is an "objective" characteristic of discourse, entails an essential requirement, that of the respect to be shown by the particular speaker for this potential of the Other. To use a term introduced by Derrida, the relationship in question is one which allows for negotiation, an operation which ineluctably leads to im- purity, indeed, to pollution. These are not qualities that enter into the domain in which the thirst for absolutes is quenched, where a desire for mystical union insistent upon total purification can find its euphoria. Not only do I abjure any theoretical interest in this transcendental purity, I fear it as the inspiration and ideology, not only of sainthood, but equally of the crusade and the holocaust. The alterity with which I am concerned is a relative alterity, in the very precise meaning of the word: what is in question is a cognitive relation, that is to say, between a cognitive subject and the object which is the object of its cognitive quest. It is this alterity</page><page sequence="14">684 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which is the constitutive historical experience of structuralism, de- construction, and semiotics. It is the experience to which Levi- Strauss's narrative alludes in the Tristes tropiques. It was precisely at the moment of the pragmatic conjunction with the object of his quest-a moment which ought to have been euphoric-that the founder of a future structuralism discovered, in spite of the success of his long, pragmatic quest-he was finally face to face with his Indians!--his cognitive failure: their anthropological alterity pro- duced the incomprehension of the cognitive subject. It is as the result of this encounter with alterity that he will receive-with what historical effect!--the linguistic mediation which Roman Jakobson will offer at their meeting at the New School for Social Research during the Second World War. The experience of alterity was foundational and constitutive of what was once called structuralism, whose present forms are primarily deconstruction, semiotics, and Foucauldian discourse analysis. Without this experience of alterity, the formalizations typical of these intellectual currents would have no reason to exist. Without the interruption of subjectivity repre- sented by alterity, the phenomenological relation between cognitive subject and object of knowledge could remain the perfectly happy and adequate matrimonial relation. It is only when Edenic knowl- edge, direct and intimate, is felt to have been lost that the need is felt to develop mediating structures of knowledge like the semiotic formalisms. Alternatively, it is possible to postulate that the imag- ination of an unmediated and adequate knowledge is secondary to the formalizing structures, taken then as primordial. Either way, semiotics and alterity are inextricably bound up together, not only by cause of origin, but constitutively. 2. Commentary Having excluded the theological speculation of an "Entirely Other," having identified the field of pertinent reflection as that of an entirely relative alterity within the field of the human sciences, hence within the social sciences, it should be specified that, as far as people are concerned, one should not speak at all of alterity in the singular. The singular is singularly out of place: in speaking of existents, the only proper form is that of alterities in the plural, which acknowledge the multiplicity and differences of others, and the attendant mul- tiplicity of criteria of difference, in relation to the one, concrete interlocutor.9 It is only as abstractly addressing a structural and epistemological relation that the singular form of "alterity" is ac-</page><page sequence="15">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 685 ceptable. In an epistemological context, therefore, the post of alterity can represent only the state of ignorance in relation to the object of knowledge it has postulated. In the case of concrete transfor- mations, the post s2 figures as a necessary postulation. It is the post of virtualization prior to any and all junction. Practically speaking, it would identify a value known to the speaker, the sociologist, the historian, before the subject (narrative, social, or historical) becomes aware of it in order to make of it the object of his desire. As we will see, in concrete operations, it is also a heuristic postulation. The contrary of a postulate of nontranscendental but absolute alterity is represented by a form of thinking that reduces any other cognitive position to itself, that is, to slot s'. Without passing phil- osophical judgment on the validity, the necessity, or the content of the operation, the phenomenological reduction seems to me to affirm the necessity of proceeding to this transformation. What is this "reduction" if not the affirmation--well or poorly based-of the illusory quality of alterity or its (re)cognition? If all knowledge can only be a "re-cognition," the recuperation of the already known, or the already given (as in Plato), alterity becomes in effect an illusion we would do better to discard. The projection of the reader's "I" in or across the textual figure that represents it anthropomorphically is in fact only the reduction of the textual figure, typically represented by a "he," to the lectorial "I." In textual theory, Jauss comes close to this position when he undertakes a categorization of literary heroes from different genres and epochs according to the principle of identification of the reader to the hero and the varied modalizations possible on the basis of this psychological process.1' It is the pleasure of reduction, per- formed by seduction, manipulation, or domination, that Jauss de- fends insistently in affirming the droit de cite of "aesthetic pleasure." Note that it is the fact of the reduction, a procedure performed by a conscious intelligence, which differentiates such an effort from a solipsism that would deny the possibility of transgressing the limits of post s'. One of the possible applications of such speculation on alterity would be the description of ideal relations between different epochs or different cultures. For the ecclesiastical Middle Ages, for example, the relational ideal was the relation with the "Entirely Other" af- firmed as ontologically existent. In our epoch, the relational ideal is represented on the semiotic square by the relation s' - s-2, the relation of "I"-"Thou." This ideal explains the popularity of certain theories that tend to be grouped under the general sociological aegis of "intersubjectivity," but which go well beyond sociology. I am</page><page sequence="16">686 NEW LITERARY HISTORY thinking, for example, of a foundational text like Martin Buber's I and Thou; of the frequent categorization of textuality considered "literary" as a communicative speech act; of the Bakhtinian reduction of textual discourse to the fluidity of oral conversational speech. Similarly, the use of the intimate, second-person form (the "tutoie- ment") in French leftism: if the content of the relationship is defined here as political, there is no reason not to find intimacy on this isotopy! We come now to more complex cases, which are also closer to us. Neither deconstruction nor semiotics remains comfortably seated upon the euphoric axis, in a domain constituted by a relation of intimacy between text and reader. Derridean discourse would like to claim the position of complex positivity on Blanch6's hexagon," recognizing both the need to emerge from the domination of the Same in occidental metaphysics -therefore turning towards alterity- and the other necessity of recognizing the impossibility of simply discarding the metaphysics which constitutes us as thinkers and readers. It therefore leads to the necessity of anchoring oneself in the post s' while turning toward s2 in a willed discomfort which distinguishes it from solipsism and from the phenomenological reduction. Thus, in the discussion published in Altiritis, there is an uncertainty as to whether the "Entirely Other" should be insisted on, in a movement attributed by Stanislas Breton to the "fanatiques de l'en soi de puret.,"'2 or whether one should accept "the multiplicity of Others." It is not clear to me whether, in the context of Derridean thought, a concept of "others" (lower case and plural) can play any determinative role at all.'3 Up to now, the discussion has dealt with the relations represented by the three posts s', s2, and s-2: the category s' has been left open. To return to the case of the personal pronouns, it is the category in which the polite "you" belongs. In the case of methodologies, it is the category of semiotics. If Benveniste was correct in considering "you" a secondary category, "you" is a secondary derivation upon primary terms which are the "I" and "thou,"je and tu. As a complex term, it is the end point of a process, not a position of departure, simultaneously including semes of /presence/ and /alterity/. It, that is to say "you," presents useful analogies in describing the work of semiotics. Saussure's primordial gesture was to exteriorize linguistic ipseity in order to transform it into an object of "scientific" knowl- edge. In general, semiotics has continued in his traces, exteriorizing at least one generation of its presuppositions, formalizing its analytic procedures, bringing them to bear especially on texts belonging to the same cultural domain as semiotics itself. In principle, the analysis</page><page sequence="17">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 687 of nineteenth- or twentieth-century texts of French or American literature, or sociosemiotic discussions of the phenomenon of con- temporary tourism, for instance, are the analyses of objects belonging to the same series of cultural codes as the cognitive subject of the analysis: belonging to the same cultural domain, both subject and object remain within the bounds of post s'. These are therefore analyses which compete with possible phenomenological discussions of the same objects. This description, however, does not do justice to the essential characteristic of semiotics. The latter, in fact, always postulates the alterity of its object, and indeed produces an "altered" object, an object "altered" by its own formalizations. Thus, the trajectory of a semiotic analysis of texts belonging to the same encoding domain as that which is constitutive of the semiotician consists first in the exteriorization of presuppositions and analytic procedures, bearing on an object close by and susceptible of identification with the subject, hence located on post s', but considered as if it were in a relation of "thou" as soon as the analytic work is begun. The latter, however, begins by postulating the object's alterity. Therefore, the trajectory, beginning in s' or s-2, postulates s2 and ends up in its final, formalized state as an object "published" in s-1. This trajectory is far from being unique to semiotics. Not only are Saussure, Greimas, and those who claim it represented by this tradition: it is the structural tradition in the larger sense of the word which can be so characterized. Did Marx and Freud, for instance, act otherwise than to take that to which we are intimately bound, even identified, hence a part of ourselves, and postulate its alterity, its strangeness to the point of being unheimlich, its adherence to an instance nonidentical to the "I" concerned, in order to construct a representation of the object, a representation taking the form of an abstract model? At a less ambitious level, that of the analysis of a particular object in relation to the general model, the latter, produced as exterior- ization of operational presuppositions, is situated on the post s'. It is the passage of the object through this post that produces the modeled representation identified with post s-'. In general, in this type of semiotic analysis, the following trajectory is performed: s-2 S S2 - S-1. This is the transformation which differentiates semiotics from phenomenology and hermeneutics. The semiotics I practice as a medievalist may be considered emblematic of what can be considered the "anthropological" use of semiotics: it follows the reverse order. Its objects are defined as alterities from the very beginning. The process therefore begins in</page><page sequence="18">688 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the post s2. It starts with the recognition of what is nonfunctional in the semiotic universe of the reader in interpreting textual processes of signification. The reader must therefore exteriorize his or her own semiotic system in order to identify its productions of meaning in juxtaposition with the performances of the object marked by its alterity. Needless to say, this identification of one's own decoding apparatus itself depends upon the juxtaposition to a different system of signification: the process of elaborating the two models is, in fact, dialectical. That dialectical process depends on retaining the juxtaposition as a junction which does not lead to conjunction, insisting on a disjunction that remains a confrontation between the two models. This retained disjunction leads, in proper time, to a transformative moment to which we will return in the conclusion. At this point, however, it is appropriate to identify this nonexclusive disjunction as the moment of the semiotic negation of alterity, a negation which cannot be performed fully, and ought not to be (should a "he" simply be transmogrified into a "thou"?): this negation of alterity always proceeds partially and hesitantly. The most frequent process is that which reproduces a local semiotic model of a concrete text by reference to the general model. In both cases, semiotics remains the production of models, of formal simulacra. In the case of application to objects marked by alterity, the semiotic transformation passes through a necessary reference to ipseity, and the postulation of a possible relation. By definition, this postulation comports a hypothesis of some semic and syntactical elements of commonality between subject and object, in spite of the latter's marking as "altered." In this type of operation, the cognitive trajectory leads from alterity to its negation and then produces the formalization of an object in s-': s2 - S-2 -- S-1. In both cases, that of application to objects identifiable to the subject as well as to objects marked by the trait of alterity, the analytic process leads to a formalization, to the production of a model or a local simulacrum represented on the semiotic square of alterity by the location of nonipseity: that of the "you" (the vou- voiement). Semiotics is constituted by a fairly complex series of formalities which are formulas of politeness addressed either to that which is already loved and which one would like to understand or to that which one would like to understand in order to know whether or not one is going to love it. In any case, the relations established by semiotics remain in the category of the respectful, in the form of our formulas of politeness: that is simultaneously the advantage and the burden of semiotics.</page><page sequence="19">THE SEMIOTICS OF ALTERITY 689 Conclusions In these remarks, the semiotic square has performed as both a discovery procedure and as the organization of an intellectual exploration, hence as the vehicle to reach what is defined as beyond semiotics: its alterities. At the same time, the semiotic square is what is being discussed, as exemplary of the formulas of politeness. The principle of recursivity has been invoked in the elaboration of a semiotic component focused on what is not semiotics. I hope to have remained, in so doing, in the domain of politeness represented, in French, by the term of vouvoiement: linguistically speaking, "you" is the marked form in that language. It is only by continuing in this manner, addressing objects located "outside" of semiotics, that the discipline can successfully continue its extraordinary development. This development encroaches partly on the domain of philosophy and is also traversed by the somewhat differently oriented practice of theory. Nevertheless, the model constructed above is workable if a partial identification of the fields of the object and subject of knowledge is postulated, rather than a naive empiricism or a total reduction. The dialectical functioning described in the sketch of the two cognitive processes can only function if that partial epistemo- logical identification is postulated. What would be the sense of a supposedly "scientific" quest-in the Cartesian and Greimasian tra- dition, rather than in the Anglo-Saxon tradition-which did not proceed by that postulation? The comparison of semiotics with its opposite number, herme- neutics, in terms of this problem is not without interest. To a large extent, the problematics of alterity plays the role in semiotics that tradition plays in hermeneutics. Both philosophemes are concerned with certain epistemological possibilities. But the two philosophemes are incorporated in vaster theoretical enterprises, answering not only to differentiae of a philosophical or theoretical nature, but undoubtedly to existential ones as well. Hermeneutics is one of the greatest philosophies of continuity: its metaphorical vocabulary is that of the inheritor, with the recurrence of terms such as "debt," "heritage," "tradition," and "recognition." Semiotics, on the other hand, is characterized by disjunction and discontinuity. Its theory and methodology are reactions to discontinuity, to the experience of alterity. It is probably this fundamental difference which explains the deformation of the concept of alterity when Jauss tries to make it enter the hermeneutic castle or circle: alterity becomes, not the</page><page sequence="20">690 NEW LITERARY HISTORY postulation of something unknown, but the figure of the neighbor in the Christian tradition. In spite of this displacement, the problematic of alterity is one of the key problems of the epoch. To recognize the nonidentical, the different, the other whose limits of differentiation are not predeterminable or predictable is, I believe, the heart of the prob- lematic located in the domains, not only of textuality, but also of interpersonal relations, political relations at the national scale, and, most obviously, at the international scale of diplomacy. If I am not entirely mistaken, semiotics has a crucial role to play in contemporary intellectual life precisely because of its self-conscious incorporation of the principle of alterity at the most fundamental level.

In this case, the presence of the specific form in question in many other languages may justify the procedure: Is English in a minority position in this respect? More important, the oddity of Benveniste's discussion from a modern English perspective is a case in point of alterity and may be turned around in a cognitive dialectical maneuver as an instrument to self-questioning: What does it say of a culture, that it has dropped the specific linguistic function of intimacy? 8 Labarribre, Altbritis, pp. 8, 17f., 28, 31, 61, 81, 84. 9 See the comments of Stanislas Breton, in Alt-ritis, pp. 53 f. and 61 f. 10 See Hans Robert Jauss, "Aesthetischer Identifikation-Versuch tiber den liter- arischen Helden," in his Aesthetische Erfahrung und literarische Hermeneutik, 3rd ed.
