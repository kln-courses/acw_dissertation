HI The political ritual generated annually by Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean captures the Australian imagination and at least the attention of international audi- ences. Shortly before Christmas, the fleet comprising six vessels steams southwards and is soon picked up by envi- ronmental organizations and the Australian navy. Public interest and anger rise as details are broadcast about the whalers' regular target of about 900 cetaceans. The stage is set for 'drama on the high seas'. In the 2009 season, Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Society were involved in direct surveillance of the fleet. So too was an Australian customs vessel, Oceanic Viking, whose objective was to gather intelligence on Japanese fishing inside Australian Antarctic Territory for a possible challenge in the International Court of Justice. Despite this concentration of cutting-edge technology, they had little success in influencing the hunt because of a near total lack of co-operation between them. The high point of the conflict came when two Sea Shepherd activists boarded a harpoon ship on which they were held for three days whilst headlines exploded globally. The incident was defused when Oceanic Viking returned the activists to their own vessel. By 2010, only the Sea Shepherd Society maintained a presence in Antarctica. But it reinforced its reputation as 'the world's most uncompromising environmental enforce- ment group' (Vidal 2008) by trying to foul Japanese pro- pellers with ropes, bombing the whalers with butyric acid capsules, and ramming the harpoon vessels off course once whales were being chased down. After protracted harass- ment by the ex ice-breaker Bob Barker, Shonan Mam No. 2 sent the $1.5-million trimaran Ady Gill to the bottom of the ocean. Later, Ady GilVs skipper boarded the Japanese whaler and presented its skipper with a demand for com- pensation. Australian legal experts said the Sea Shepherd Society had crossed the line from activism to piracy. Amid all this maritime mayhem, little attention is paid when the whalers reach their target and all protagonists limp back to the northern hemisphere. But they leave behind in Australia widespread resentment that this con- flict remains unresolved after several decades. Political parties in opposition repeatedly indulge in sabre-rattling over the whaling issue; once in office, the realpolitik of Japan being Australia's second largest trading partner pre- vails. The current Labor government was elected in late 2007 with an explicit and determined anti-whaling plat- form; in power, it fast retreated behind a screen of dip- lomatic negotiation, where it was roundly condemned as weak and hypocritical (Singer 2008). Fig. 2 High-level media coverage continues throughout the whaling season in Australia. The Australian, 8 January 2010. i tr $ CO I These costs are small beer by comparison with those incurred by the Japanese. Whaling is subsidized to the hilt by the Japanese state. The return from meat sales is meagre when set against grants and loans: only a few hundred workers are directly employed; recurrent costs constantly escalate. The most important cost by far is the diminution of Japan's international stature, for continued Antarctic whaling attracts widespread international condemnation, especially from New Zealand and the United Kingdom, Australia's closest allies. The whaling war has become one of the longest run- ning conservation issues (Darby 2007). How has it come about that the end point is little more than a diplomatic stalemate? How has Australia become the self-appointed guardian of Antarctic whales while Japan resolutely continues to kill them? I draw on my own ethnographic research in Australia (Peace 2005) and several publica- tions detailing the position from inside Japan to address these questions. The politics of anti-whaling The ecological proximity of the two populations is crucial to understanding the close identification of the Australian public with whales in the region. Interest in whale behaviour seems insatiable in Australia. Through books, videos, maga- zines, museums and tours, whales have entered into public culture. But those from Antarctica are routinely referred to as 'our whales', and protecting them has become a national responsibility. Currently, about 13,000 whales migrate up the coast of Western Australia, and 7000 along the eastern coast: many are humpbacks, which typically swim close to the shore. As regional media provide regular updates on whale movements to Australia's predominantly coastal population, the scale of casual observation is huge as fami- lies head for promontories, beaches and jetties to watch the whale migration. Radio and television are also at the fore- front of elaborating a discourse of possession where whales are concerned. Since Australia has no physical boundary with other countries, there is a naturalness to commenta- tors talking about 'our whales', 'our visitors from the south' ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 26 NO 3, JUNE 201 0 5</page><page sequence="2">6 ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 26 NO 3, JUNE 2010 and 'our gentle giants', labels which have entered everyday vocabulary. Explanations as to why there are increasing numbers of whales in Australian waters are similarly natu- ralized: since females calve in warmer waters to the north, it is said they know they will be secure there. According to a talkback radio host in Queensland: 'It's incredible they keep coming back to the same place. I suppose it's because they're so intelligent they know somehow our whales are totally protected.' This is the opening gambit to an anthropomorphic discourse which lasts throughout the annual migration. Whales are considered to have a range of senses and an intelligence to which we can relate, as well as being defenceless and vulnerable to all manner of prédation. By comparison with the decidedly muted reception accorded to desperate refugees from the north, the much-heralded arrival of defenceless cetaceans brings them firmly within our moral orbit. An Aboriginal girl included in a delegation to an International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Alaska displayed 'wisdom far beyond her years', according to The Age (1 June 2007), when she said: These are our humpbacks [...] The first thing they see when they come from their mother's womb is the Australian coastline. So if anyone should determine what happens to them, it's us.' Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that when whales are rescued by members of the public, identifica- tion with and responsibility for them assumes heightened significance. When Most whales' end up in Sydney harbour, crowds several thousand strong assemble and speculate anthropomorphically on the reasons for their presence. But whale rescues express the special bond. Beachings are frequent in remote locations like Tasmania's west coast where residents are few - but these are tough and resilient people, the media says, who pull together because it's in their nature to do so when faced with tragedy. Newspaper reports strive to capture the emotion and empathy generated by such occasions. One 'mercy mis- sion' that attracted 1500 volunteers to save 80 killer whales involved 'a tremendous show of community spirit. The mammoth effort saw wet-suit clad volunteers cradle whales in shallow waters, working tirelessly to keep them wet, upright and facing the beach as they became increas- ingly distressed' (The Australian, 1 March 2005). Massive lifeless bodies silently observed by children and parents have become a stock image, reinforcing emotive terms like 'cradle'. When an entire pod dies, much can be made of the human-like sociability which has proved its undoing. In their altruistic efforts to save the first victim, the rest have become beached too. It is, however, above all in the multi-million-dollar industry of whale-watching that the notion of a close bond with whales is most elaborated. Below-deck presenta- tions on whale- watching boats intersperse brief mention of Australia's whaling past with stunning video images, ren- dering the country's currently humane, enlightened position all the more impressive. By joining a whale watch tour, it is explained, ordinary people are playing their part in the national project to 'save the whales'. Larger operators give a small percentage of takings to whale protection organiza- tions - so as one skipper said, 'you're not just paying for today's privilege of seeing magnificent whales, you're doing your bit as good Aussies to save them for your children.' All this sets the stage for direct encounters when all talk becomes suffused with anthropomorphism. Whales con- sidered 'regular visitors' to Queensland's Platypus Bay are accorded human characteristics, with females being 'affectionate' and 'caring' towards 'shy' or 'independent' offspring. Whilst the female 'recovers her strength', the male 'rides shotgun' alongside her and their 'curious' young on the return journey to Antarctica. With the whales discursively rendered so human-like, the tour becomes a Fig. 3 (top right) An image used to advertise whale watch cruising out ofHervey Bay in Queensland by Tasman Venture (www.tasmanventure. com.au/): 'As with humans, all humpback whales differ in appearance, whether it is their colouring or the shape of their tail fluke '.

LL %</page><page sequence="3">venue for intercourse with them. Watchers are encouraged to shout, yell and abandon customary inhibition. A trip's success is measured less by the number of whales seen than by the quality of empathie relations forged with them. Watchers are congratulated for contributing to 'the trust needed to save the whales for future generations'. So the whale has become a contemporary totem to be approached with affection, respect, even adulation. In rela- tion to them, we express our contemporary humanity, our commitment to civilized standards, as seems imperative when relations between society and nature are substan- tially awry. Since we have 'saved the whale' in our part of the world, this small but significant reversal suggests that a broader equilibrium between the two can be salvaged. It follows that pro-whaling countries can lay no similar claim to being enlightened and humane, and since only the Japanese kill 'Australian whales', they are the target of sustained demonization. As the fleet enters the Southern Ocean, the media describes it as 'an invasion' down to the last detail. In 2010, with 'the killing season' barely under way, the Japanese contracted two planes to fly from Australian airports to locate anti-whaling activists. These were dubbed 'spy flights' aimed at provoking 'sea warfare' {Herald-Sun, 7 January 10). When this culminated in the collision that sank the 'small' and 'defenceless' trimaran, the same tabloid criminalized the Japanese for this 'ram raid on the high seas'. The entire fleet was 'an increasing menace', while activists were praised for trying 'to stop the whale slaughter'. 'Butcher', 'massacre' and 'torture' are terms routinely deployed to describe the killing of 'defenceless' and 'gentle' whales. Video clips are endlessly replayed to demonstrate the destructive force of the harpoon. Pictures of dead whales being hauled into the Nishin Maru also capture the 'brave', 'heroic' attempts at hindrance by 'eco- warriors' and the bloody red stain that spreads from the factory ship once flensing begins. The dominant message is unambiguous: the Japanese are a barbaric and cruel lot, just as they were back in World War II. In true Orientalist fashion (Said 1978), they are deceitful in claiming to be engaged in scientific research, they are unreliable in providing data on their catches, they buy the support of bankrupt Third World nations, above all they are cruel and callous in the way they go about their whaling business. In brief, the totemic relationship between charismatic megafauna and ordinary Australians is reproduced in mul- tiple contexts. This is why government failure to realize a satisfactory outcome grates so badly with the public: having promised so much, those in power have failed to deliver and lag behind public opinion. Meanwhile, identification with the totemized whale has become part of how Australians imagine themselves as decent and enlightened citizens in the contemporary world. The image has an especially sharp definition because it is constituted against a damming, even racist, portrayal of the Japanese. The politics of pro-whaling On the other side of the conflict, pro- whaling is similarly embedded in the everyday world of the Japanese. But as unswerving political policy, it is thoroughly driven by institutions within the Japanese state. One explanation given for this is that the whaling industry and the con- sumption of whale meat are recognized as significant tra- ditions which must be honoured. This heritage, it is said, goes back to the Jonan period (1000-300 BC) (see Hirata 2004, 2005). But by the late 1 8th century advances in tech- nology and expansion of trade routes helped the industry to become fully commercialized in southern and northern Japan, where whale meat eating (gyoshoku bunka) became a significant part of ritual life. A more frequent claim is that in the early 20th century, a period of exceptional rural hardship, the northward spread of whaling provided inhabitants with protein. Then canned whale meat became part of the military diet, and after 1945 food shortages were avoided by the expansion of whaling on the advice of the American military occupiers. According to Arne Kalland: During the first post war years whale meat accounted for 47 per cent of the animal protein intake by Japanese, many of whom are convinced that whales saved them from major famine. Indeed, some of the attachment to whales and whale meat pos- sibly stems from this belief (1998: n.p.). Continuity was then maintained as whale meat became a regular item in the carefully-prepared obentos, or lunch boxes, which children ta^e to school. The Australian anti-whaling lobby makes much of sur- veys which find that only a small proportion of the Japanese population consumes whftle meat. But this is somewhat irrelevant when gyoshoku bunka is considered a distinctive part of a culture generally unparallelled in its uniqueness. It is likewise unimportant that whale consumption occurs in other countries, such as the Faroe Islands. What matters most is that the exceptional elements of Japanese culture, including eating whale meat, are valorized and preserved across the board. Eating whale meat represents an inte- gral part of how the Japanese locate themselves in a world geared to the destruction of regional differences. The anti-whaling rhetoric of countries like Australia and the United States is thus interpreted as a challenge to the right of the Japanese to live as they choose. While the language of cultural imperialism is not much used in the West nowadays, the stridency of anti-whaling rhetoric from overseas keeps it current inside Japan. A complemen- tary argument has it that the Japanese do not attach the same significance to the whale as Westerners do because of the way it is culturally categorized. The whale falls into the category of fish rather than mammal: the character for 'whale' (kujira) has two parts, the first being the sign for a fish (uo-hen) (Hirata 2005). When reduced to just another species of fish, whales possess none of the aura which nowadays surrounds mammals in the West. Even when killing whales is considered problematic, traditional Buddhist rituals carried out by the whalers aim to appease the deceased creature's spirit (Kalland and Moeran 1992). Whaling carries none of the heinous qualities which Australians attribute as a matter of course. For these reasons, prominent analysts (Kalland 1998, Wong 2001 ) agree, attempts to mobilize a minority opinion against whaling consistently prove unsuccessful and the field is left open for pro-whaling views to thrive. Kalland maintains that eating whale has assumed significance in recent times precisely as a response to the 'cultural impe- rialism' of anti-whaling propaganda: [It] has become a ritual act through which the partakers express their belonging to the Japanese tribe, not only the local commu- nity as before. Eating whale meat is seen as setting the Japanese apart from others. They thus appear unique, and the whaling issue serves to strengthen the much cherished Japanese myths about their identity, which helps fuel one form of Japanese nationalism. (Kalland 1998: n.p.) Fig. 7. Cooked whale meat for consumption o Ì § 111 LU Ê O co W z ÜJ ANTHROPOLOGY TODAY VOL 26 NO 3, JUNE 2010 7</page><page sequence="4">This kind of prioritization of varying cultural considera- tions is, of course, one of the strong points of an anthro- pological perspective. But in order to explain Japan's resolute refusal to budge where whaling is concerned, accounts from other quarters appropriately focus on the variable of institutional power. We should recall here that whaling is heavily subsidized, generates no profit, employs few workers and faces rising costs. Modern nation-states everywhere subsidize unprofitable ventures, but not many are prepared to incur the opprobrium of other powerful countries with which they have their most important rela- tionships as a consequence. Several social analysts who problematize Japan's unmoving position (Wong 2001, Hirata 2004, Danaher 2002) return to the point that the whale is categorized as mere fish. For this means that the whaling industry in its entirety comes under the conservative Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (MAFF) and its Fisheries Agency. The agency is the powerhouse that has directed all aspects of whaling since the late 1 980s, when several commercial enterprises were amalgamated into one, Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha, and the government of the day established the Institute for Cetacean Research (ICR). These arrangements were made in response to the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling, promulgated in 1982. At the time Japan saw this as a highly provocative deci- sion. It came as IWC membership was being broadened to facilitate stacking the commission with anti-whaling interest groups, and the United States had threatened Japan with the loss of access to the lucrative Alaskan fishery if it did not go along with the moratorium. Eventually Japan agreed, but only because it was possible under the morato- rium to continue whaling for scientific purposes. The ICR was established for precisely this purpose: it was to provide the data needed to justify whaling by Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha on lines laid down by MAFF and the Fisheries Agency. Although the ICR is officially a non- commercial, semi-governmental organization (in English parlance a quango, in Japanese zaidan hojin), it serves as the scientific handmaiden for the two state bodies. Its pri- mary goal is to marshal the evidence needed to persuade the IWC to finally lift its moratorium on commercial whaling. Needless to say, the value of this scientific data is the subject of intense international disagreement. Fig. 8 (right). Whale meat at the Tsukijifish market, Tokyo.

LU Three points are crucial about the Fisheries Agency and MAFF. First, because of the 'enigmatic' organization of state power in Japan (van Wolferen 1990), they enjoy a high degree of autonomy from other government institutions whilst remaining in close competition with them for state resources. The mere suggestion that the supremely symbolic issue of whaling should be reviewed would be interpreted as political weakness by MAFF's rivals. With regard to pres- sure from outside Japan, the agency and MAFF believe that if any quarter were conceded on the whaling front, it would quickly be followed by similar demands over other prized fish. Since Japan purchases one third of the fish sold on the world market, such a prospect is unthinkable for those dedi- cated to protecting the national interest. Second, while scientific and media commentators in the West automatically place scare quotes around the term sci- entific whaling, there is no such questioning of ICR data inside Japan. Its voluminous research on all whale catches does not receive the critical assessment a Western quango would expect. The ICR's science is straightforwardly reported by the media, leaving the public without critical or contradictory information. Third, it is argued that this reproduces a public indiffer- ence to the conflict over whaling which would be incom- prehensible elsewhere. Because of Fisheries Agency hegemony, more liberal institutions are disqualified from problematizing the issue. The Environment Agency has responsibility for conservation issues, but fails to offer any critique since it lacks the statutory responsibility to do so (Danaher 2002). Input from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is limited to defending Japan's position when under attack at IWC meetings. Mike Danaher summarizes the influence of the Fisheries Agency thus: '[It] has built up the whaling issue into a policy issue of national interest to protect its own interests from foreign pressure. It has expanded the whaling issue into one that crosses over into traditional culture, national pride, food security and sover- eignty' (2002: 116). It virtually goes without saying that as a result 'domestic NGOs have proved to be ineffectual in influencing Japanese whaling policy' (Hirata 2005: 147). Conclusion The concept of culture often surfaces in Australian print and electronic media to account for the depth and dura- tion of the conflict over Japan's continued whaling. But it is used in broad-brush fashion to characterize, and sometimes caricature, behavioural patterns and values purportedly commonplace across each society. Even the denial of culture has become part of political practice. When the IWC convened in Adelaide, the Minister for the Environment, who had just lost a key vote over a whale sanctuary for the South Pacific, crassly proclaimed that since the Japanese fleet was capital-intensive, bristled with marine technology, and had 'only a wealth-creating objec- tive to it', there was 'no cultural aspect whatsoever' to the whaling venture {The Australian, 10 July 2000). By contrast, I have tried to draw out some of the more salient cultural influences that have contributed to the political divide between Australia and Japan. In meta- phorical terms, the whaling war is best conceived of not so much as the contemporary political drama with which I began, but rather as an archaeological site in which factors of varying cultural significance have become sedimented over time. Some historical factors have been discreetly for- gotten, some traditions have been enthusiastically revived. Some market forces have been eliminated, other economic factors have flourished. Some loci of power have gone into decline, others have become undeniably influential. But, as with real archaeological sites, it is possible to specify particular times at which the course of history was effec- tively changed. The first date is 1978, the year in which Australia's last whaling station, at Albany in Western Australia, closed down. From that time onwards, there was little impedi- ment to Australia emerging as the most vocal anti-whaling nation-state in its hemisphere. As the country entered a neo-totemic phase in which long-established myths lost their potency, the politics and morality of anti-whaling became part of the forging of a reconstituted national identity. The second date is 1982, when the IWC declared its moratorium on commercial whaling, thus forcing Japan to reorganize the industry as a state enterprise. Whaling was effectively removed from the marketplace and turned into a bureaucratic and scientific exercise. In this intensely capitalist country, the profit motive could neither drive nor legitimize the continuation of whaling, especially a long way from home. At the same time, whenever the fleet set sail, whalers and the country to which they belonged ran the gamut of a vituperative 'cultural imperialism'. So the killing of whales is nowadays only part of the problem. Over time, it has become entwined with a diver- sity of economic, political and cultural considerations. As well as pinpointing dates, it is important to empha- size that throughout this lengthy period of conflict both Japan and Australia have consolidated their status as sig- nificant players on the international stage, to the point at which national reputations are of inescapable significance. National identity and cultural integrity have become potent forces as globalization has rendered spatial boundaries rel- atively unimportant. Inside Australia, it is often asserted that the main reason Japan continues whaling is because of 'the loss of face' which an end to the practice will entail. This argument is part and parcel of the Orientalist discourse which informs the annual demonization of the Japanese. On both sides of the whaling war, the combined force of national identity and cultural integrity may well prove as great an impediment as any other to the resolution of this long-running transnational conflict. • Danaher, Mike 2002.
