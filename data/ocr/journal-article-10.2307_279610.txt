<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAY FIGURINES FROM THE LOWER PECOS REGION, TEXAS HARRY J. SHAFER All reported findings of anthropomorphic clay figurines from the lower Pecos region of Texas are synthesized. Considerations are given to figurine chronology, technology, morphology, and function. The finds made with adequate chronological control occur in the Middle Archaic period, from about 2000 B.C. to 200 B.C A brief description of the Lower Pecos Archaic cultural system is presented in order to place the figurines in a context for functional analysis. The figurines are hand-shaped, usually unfired, and represent both males and females. Painted or incised decorations are restricted to female forms; socio-cultural explanations for this pattern are explored. The specific uses of the figurines remain indefinite. THIS STUDY SYNTHESIZES the data on clay figurines from the lower Pecos region of Texas (Fig. 1). Since the first reporting of unfired clay artifacts from caves and rockshelters in this area (Davenport 1938), clay figurines have been found in several large rockshelters. These finds are reviewed and attention is given to their manufacture, form, temporal distribution and possible functions. DESCRIPTION OF THE LOWER PECOS ARCHAIC The Archaic in the lower Pecos region, where the Pecos and Devil's rivers join the Rio Grande, began about 7000 B.C. and lasted until about A.D. 1000 (Story 1966, Table 1). Johnson (1964:97) describes it as "a more or less uniform Archaic culture from beginning to end." The Archaic continuum has been subdivided into several chronological periods on the basis of stylistic changes in projectile points. For example, Johnson (1964, Fig. 25) divides the sequence into Early, Middle, and Late periods; and Story (1966, Table 1) separates the Archaic into five periods. The divisions established by Johnson are used here. The material culture and subsistence patterns of the Lower Pecos Archaic have been intensively investigated during the last decade (Epstein 1963; Schuetz 1956, 1962; Johnson 1964; Ross 1965; Parsons 1965a; Dibble 1967; Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Sorrow 1968; Collins 1969; and Alexander 1970). A synthesis of these investigations has not appeared, although archaeological summaries of the lower Pecos archaeology have been prepared by Lehmer (1960), Story (1966), and Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967, Ch. 4). Story (1966:8, 9) states that: Whlile it would be an oversimplification to view the prehistoric cultures as homogeneous and unchanging, there does appear to have existed in the area a persistent cultural pattern dominated by a hunting and gathering mode of subsistence. The archaeological sites occur as accumulations of occupational debris, sometimes deeply stratified, along alluvial terraces in the entrenched canyons of the lower Pecos, Devil's and Rio Grande rivers. Middens, occasionally deep and dry, occur in rockshelters and caves found along the main canyons and their tributaries. Open air sites are also found in the upper reaches of tributary canyons and along canyon rims. A cogent description of the lifeway of the Lower Pecos Archaic populations has been prepared by Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:40): However described terminologically, it was a self-contained, inward-looking tradition, anciently adapted and committed to a relatively static existence in an unchanging world. Introduction of the bow and arrow, sometime between A.D. 600-1,000, presaged a quickening of culture changes, possibly population movements and end of the old tradition as such. But many of the essentials of this way of life persisted into historic times among Coahuiltecan and related peoples. 148</page><page sequence="2">CLAY FIGURINES NEW MEXICO I ' I'- , ,- AREA GUL F OF M EXI CO N 0 100 200 L--I - I S Fig. 1. Area map. Newcomb hypothesizes that the basic social unit was a patrilocal extended family, and that cooperate relations with other bands were determined by kinship affinities (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:64). He also suggests that hunting and foraging may have brought closely related bands together; however, the band size was probably fluid and varied according to season and economic activities. Paleoecological studies by Story and Bryant (1966), Riskind (1970), and Bryant (1974) support Story's and Newcomb's generalizations: the people were gatherers, hunters and fishermen who completely lacked knowledge of gardening and were not in contact with populations who had such knowledge. The food resources in the area were sufficient only for a low density population; this assumption is based on the author's own interpretation of the archaeological data. For example, while the archaeological remains in the lower Pecos area are impressive, especially considering the variety and number of sites, the areas of optimal habitat were relatively limited because of the OKLAHO M A Shafer] 149</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY distribution of water and the lack of suitable occupational space within the canyons. Consequently, people lived in the same places over thousands of years. This sometimes resulted in impressively deep and stratified middens. The lower Pecos region has some of the richest art of the Archaic period in North America. Most common and characteristic is the rock art in the shelter and cave galleries (Jackson 1938:165-239; Kirkland 1939; Gebhard 1960; Grieder 1966; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:37-110). Painted pebbles are also frequently encountered. These objects are usually stream-worn limestone pebbles painted with abstract linear designs, but sometimes anthropomorphic symbols can be recognized. The designs usually are painted with a black pigment but red paint is also represented. Rarely are stylistic parallels seen between the painted pebbles and pictographs on the cave and rockshelter walls. The mobile art represented by the painted pebbles has received only limited stylistic (Davenport and Chelf 1941) and chronological (Parsons 1965b) analysis. LOWER PECOS FIGURINES Davenport (1938) recovered a group of unfired clay objects from midden fill during the Witte Memorial Museum excavations at Eagle Cave. His descriptions of these artifacts (1938:10) are as follows: Scattered through Layers A, B, and C were twelve objects of cigar-like shape . . . these appear to have been moulded from clay. One specimen still shows a finger and fingernail imprint. Most of them still show the twist used to give them the shape they now have. Four of the specimens recovered by Davenport are illustrated in Fig. 2a-d. Judging from his description, it should not be literally interpreted that the specimens were "moulded"; the proper terminology would seem to be that they were shaped by hand from clay. Davenport (1938:11) goes on to say that: The material seems to be a pure clay without temper and was probably sun-baked. When dry it is much too hard to scratch with a fingernail, but when moistened for a few moments with water it is easily scratched. Although most of them show numerous scratches, only one seems to have anything resembling decoration. This consists of fine parallel cuts made before the clay hardened. None of these show any sign of wear from use. The decorated specimen (Fig. 2a) is broken. Additional comnments will be made about this specimen in a later section. More recent excavations at Eagle Cave by the University of Texas at Austin produced 22 additional objects of clay from midden deposits (Ross 1965, Table 15). Six of these artifacts clearly are figurine fragments (Fig. 2f-k). The paste of each can be described as a fine silty clay showing varying degrees of burning burning but none can actually be considered fired. It is probable that most of the clay objects were accidentally burned as are most of the artifacts from the University of Texas excavations at this site. All of the clay artifacts are fragmentary but the shapes bear a marked resemblance to those reported by Davenport. Two are decorated by linear punctated designs (Fig. 2j, k). Other figurines found at Coontail Spin Rockshelter (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965:91-97) were obtained from trash areas. Three of these specimens are headless forms (Fig. 2m-o), two of which have or had two cone-shaped appendages attached near one end (Fig. 2m, n). It is assumed that these appendages represent breasts and symbolize female figures. One of the female figures exhibits a pattern of incised lines down the front and across the breast area. The vertical lines consist of alternating pairs of zig-zag and parallel lines. Randomly oriented fiber impressions occur on both sides of one specimen (Fig. 2o); the specimen is flattened and appears as if it was pressed against fibrous material while the clay was plastic. One aberrant anthropomorphic specimen from Coontail Spin is complete (Fig. 2q). It has a long nose and tiny punctations for eyes; a small hole immediately below the nose apparently represents the mouth. This is the only specimen in the lower Pecos sample which emphasizes the head over the torso.

All Coontail Spin specimens are unfired, but several are slightly burned; that is, the fine silty clay will readily absorb moisture, and a tiny clay fragment removed from one specimen did disintegrate on contact after being left for several hours in water. Greer (1966) illustrates a single figurine from Castle Canyon Shelter in Val Verde County. The context of this specimen is unknown but it is a female form made of a silty clay with no tempering 151 Q 5 I</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Fig. 21). The specimen is headless and the broken edges are slightly smoothed, presumably from aboriginal handling. The clay has been baked, possibly accidentally, but the heating was not sufficient to actually fire the clay. A clay figurine specimen was recovered from excavations at Muertos Cave near Shumla in Val Verde County by the Witte Memorial Museum (Davenport and Chelf 1941, PI. III, 4). The precise context in which this specimen was found is unknown. The figurine is illustrated in Figure 2e, and has been described by Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks (1965:93, 94): This well-fired specimen is realistically sculptured with the hips and breasts in proportion to the rest of the torso. The head and the lower hips region are missing. In the lower central area of the back is a series of short, horizontal stripes that become progressively smaller as they go upward. Surrounding this is a design composed of short, horizontal stripes of equal length. A series of horizontal (sic) lines beginning at each breast extends downward diagonally across the sides to the back. A small circle painted on the lower front of the specimen probably represents the vulva. Above this are two nested triangular elements; a straight vertical line extends upward from the apex of the outer triangle. Attached to the upper end of this line is another line that runs diagonally across the right side of the figurine. Other lines, originating at the upper edge, extend downward a short distance, then turn at a diagonal and terminate at the sides of the figure. These lines appear to originally have crossed the breasts, but the paint in that region seems to have been rubbed off. The specimen was made by pressing together three or four clay rods side by side (1965:94). The most recent discovery was a cache of four clay figurines in a large rockshelter (designated as 41 W 456) in a tributary canyon of the Pecos River near its confluence with the Rio Grande (Shafer and Speck 1974). The figurines were found together in a fiber lens which also contained matting, knotted fibers, sandal fragments, lithic debitage, and artifacts. No special preparation of the area of placement was observed, and the purpose of the cache is not known, but as will be explained later, it is unlikely that the placement represented "planting as seed" as a part of an increase cult (cf. Morss 1954:53). The figurines are all of brown silty clay, untempered save for a few quartz sand grains which are probably natural inclusions. Organic intrusions (possibly rootlets) in the clay are not charred and the paste readily disintegrates in water, clearly indicating that the specimens were unfired. The paste appears to be identical in all specimens, suggesting that they were made from the same clay source. Three of the specimens from 41 VV 456 are complete and are illustrated to scale (Fig. 2r-t). The body portions are bi-pointed and cross-sections are flat oval. Two specimens have cone-shaped appendages attached near one end; both of these had two each, but one specimen has only one remaining. The latter specimen has a surface design in addition to the appendages (Fig. 2s). This decoration consists of a vertical line down the center, and intersecting diagonal lines. The vertical line extends about two-thirds of the total length; the diagonal lines intersect with the center line and are oriented downward toward both sides. The fragmentary specimen (not illustrated) is an end portion similar in form to those described above. The occurrence of other figurines in West Texas was noted by Morss (1954:45, 46). Twenty-six were found by Coffin (1932) in Bee Cave Cave in Brewster County, and Crimmins (1929) relates the find of a male-female pair from a rockshelter in Eagle Canyon in the Big Bend region. The Bee Cave specimens were unfired according to Coffin and several of them were painted with linear lines. Since Coffin recovered figurines from structure floors yielding arrow shafts and corn, the Bee Cave figurines could postdate the lower Pecos specimens by as much as 2000 years. TI'his is suggested because the bow and arrow does not appear in the Lower Pecos sequence until about A.D. 1000. Furthermore, in addition to corn, Coffin found brownware pottery in the Bee Cave deposits. Considering the artifact assemblage at Bee Cave, Coffin's figurines would probably equate with Basketmaker specimens rather than those from the Lower Pecos region. Comments on Technology All of the Lower Pecos clay figurines are made of untempered fine silty clay. All but one can be described as unfired although several specimens, particularly certain ones from Eagle Cave, Coontail Spin, and the lone example from Castle Canyon, may have been slightly burned. It is very 152 [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975</page><page sequence="6">CLAY FIGURINES likely that this burning was accidental since an inspection of lithic and faunal artifacts from Eagle Cave shows high frequency of burning. Only one figurine is described as "well fired"; this example, from Muertos Cave, could be accidental also. The figurines were made in two ways, one of which was to form several short coils or rods of clay and simply weld them together and smooth the overall surface with the fingers. This was observed by Davenport from Eagle Cave and by Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks (1965:94) in their examination of the Muertos Cave specimen. The second technique was to form a single mass of clay into the desired shape; apparently the clay was rolled between the palms of the hands and finally shaped with the fingers. Traces of what appear to be palm prints on one example from 41 VV 456 suggest this technique. Decorations consist of cone-shaped appendages presumably representing female breasts, and incised, punctated, or painted linear designs. Where sexual identifications are possible, linear designs are restricted to female forms. This is demonstrable on specimens from 41 WVV 456, Coontail Spin, and Muertos Cave. Two fragments from Eagle Cave have punctated linear designs but it is not possible to determine if these specimens had breasts. A third decorated figurine has an incised linear decoration but it is also fragmentary; however, Davenport's sketch of this specimen, reproduced in Figure 2a, shows what may have been the remains of a breast. The figurines vary, especially in overall form, and this may be related to chronology; at this time it is difficult to determine how significant this variation is. The striking thing about the figurines is the portion of the body which is emphasized, the torso. With one exception, heads are not emphasized, and most female forms are headless. If the two female forms from 41 WVV 456 are representative, then the heads were not stylistically accentuated. Dating the Figurines Only one reported site, Eagle Cave, has yielded figurines from a radiocarbon dated context. Most of these specimens were recovered from Stratum I, which was disturbed fill (Ross 1965:15, Table 15), but specimens also occurred in undisturbed context in Stratum IIa from which one radiocarbon date of 1460 B.C. ? 160 (Pearson, Davis, Tamers, and Johnstone 1965) was obtained. Projectile point styles are the best means available of establishing a tentative date for the figurines, since they are the most sensitive indicators in the lower Pecos chronology. A securely dated point sequence bridging several thousand years of prehistory in the lower Pecos area has been established as a result of intensive investigations during the late 1950s and 1960s (Epstein 1963; Johnson 1964; Ross 1965; Dibble 1967; Sorrow 1968). Excavations were sufficiently controlled at three sites to establish the associations between points and figurines: Eagle Cave, Coontail Spin, and 41 WVV 456. Point types associated with the undisturbed Stratum II at Eagle Cave were Langtry and Val Verde. At Coontail Spin the predominate types recovered in stratigraphic association with the clay figurines were Langtry, Val Verde, and Shumla (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965, Table 2). Langtry is essentially contemporaneous with Val Verde (Dibble 1967, Fig. 28), and Shumla has since been subdivided into chronologically distinct forms. One form is approximately contemporaneous with Langtry and Val Verde, while the other, which is usually smaller could date as much as 1000 years later (1967, Fig. 28). Four points were recovered from the fiber lens in which the 41 VV 456 figurine cache was found. Two are identifiable as Langtry and one is a Val Verde. The fourth specimen is untyped. The data range for Langtry and Val Verde established by dating associated charcoal at Arenosa Shelter is about 2000 B.C. to 1200 B.C. (David S. Dibble, personal communication). The single Carbon-14 date from Eagle Cave also falls within this range. Since one variety of Shumla points dates as late as 200 B.C., the suggested tentative date range for the lower Pecos figurines is 2000 B.C. to 200 B.C. Clay objects, possibly figurines, are known from one other site in the lower Pecos area, Arenosa Shelter, and materials from this deeply-stratified site are currently being analyzed (David S. Dibble, personal communication). Shafer] 153</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIGURINE FUNCTION The function of an archaeological specimen may be inferred on the basis of several lines of investigation, depending on the kind of artifact and the material used in its manufacture. Prerequisite to any functional analysis, however, are statements clarifying the theoretical assumptions on which the interpretations are based and a description of the cultural systems responsible for the artifacts being studied. Theoretical Assumptions (1) The figurines are regarded as an art form of a Lower Pecos Archaic cultural system. Culture is viewed as an organized system composed of interrelated parts (White and Dillingham 1973:13). While the functional analysis must be approached synchronically, a cultural system is not regarded as being static; rather, the system is viewed as oscillating through time (cf. Clarke 1968). (2) Art is assumed to be a part of the communicative aspect of the culture which produced it; more specifically, it is considered as an indirect form of communication (Service 1966:77). (3) Cultural values and world view reach expression in art (Levine 1957:951). Included in this assumption is the notion that the artist projects the values and symbols in his art which evoke emotional and aesthetic responses from other members of that society (cf. Stout 1971; Fisher 1971). (4) The Lower Pecos Archaic art is essentially conservative. This assumption is based on archaeological interpretations and Service's (1966:77) generalization concerning "primitive" art that "adherence to traditional forms and techniques is considered more important than creativity." It can therefore be expected that lower Pecos art forms are geographically restricted in style and were long-lasting. Morphological Variation of Lower Pecos Figurines There are several lines of investigation from which functional data for the lower Pecos figurines can be derived. Specifically, these are archaeological and cultural context, form, and ethnographic analogy. The figurine sample reveals three patterns: (1) a notable similarity in form and technology within the area; (2) a division of sexes (if the assumption that the appliques on certain specimens represent breasts-hence females-and those without appliques are males is correct); and (3) when nearly complete specimens are considered, decorations are restricted to figurines having breasts. In regard to the first pattern, Muensterberger (1971) emphasizes that an important aspect of "primitive" art is the striking similarity in style within a certain area. He cites psychological and social conditions as being largely responsible and, indeed, one characteristic of "primitive" art noted previously is the limited self-expression of the artist. This characteristic can be seen in the rock art of the lower Pecos described by Kirkland and Newcomb (1967). Possible explanations for the second and third patterns mentioned above will be considered together since they are very likely related. Muensterberger (1971) noted that body decoration, particularly scarification, tattooing, and painting in "primitive" societies is often repeated in their sculpture. The likely reason for this, as stated earlier, is that artists emphasize the features that have symbolic meaning in their society; that is, the artists' intent is to communicate and this is done by using features that distinguish sex and social status in their respective societies. A review of the ethnographic literature available on indigenous south Texas and northern Mexican Indian groups who had extractive technologies reveals numerous references to body decorations. For instance, Ruecking (1955) reports tattooing and body painting among Coahuiltecan bands in Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and south Texas. In Tamaulipas, men were tattooed on the face and body while the women were tattooed on the face and breast. Ruecking suggests that tattooing may have indicated marital status or prestige. This suggestion is supported by Newcomb's (1961:64) statement that tattooing and body painting were used to mark sex and age in some Karankawa groups living along the central Texas coast. Tattooing, body painting, and scarification also served to signify group identity among other Texas Indian 154 [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975</page><page sequence="8">CLAY FIGURINES hunter-gatherer groups (Ruecking 1955; Newcomb 1961:39). Although none of the references specifically state that body decorations were limited to either sex, it is suggested that the lower Pecos figurine decorations marked social status, probably either kinship or marital, among the females. Another explanation for figurine decoration is that the surface treatment merely represents clothing and/or ornamentation as suggested by Basketmaker III and Hohokam figurines illustrated by Morss (1954, Figs. 19, 26). This interpretation is considered to be unlikely for the Lower Pecos Archaic because body decoration was confined to certain female forms, and burials from the area usually lack material ornamentation (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965:8-12; Greer and Benfer 1964). Use of Lower Pecos Figurines Morss (1954:53-63) examined the ethnography of the American Southwest in an attempt to determine the function of clay figurines there. The most commonly cited function was use in "increase cults," especially among the Pueblo. "Increase" may refer either to the population itself or to horticultural reproduction. Morss also cites evidence of the use of female figurines in Middle American agricultural fertility cults "symbolizing the fecundity of Earth Mother" (1954:56). He further suggests that the clay figurines in non-agricultural California may represent diffusion from Puebloan areas. Other functions mentioned by Morss for clay figurines in the American Southwest include use as dolls among the Hopi (the children may have considered them dolls but the elders regarded them as representations of supernatural beings); as images of victims for sorcery; and as religious icons as in Mesoamerica. However, Morss favors the suggestion that the principal function of female figurines was in increase cults. He (1954:61) states that: On the whole the evidence favors the view that the gynecomorphic figurines of the Southwest, with the possible exception of the latest and most elaborate examples, related to a human increase cult involving concepts basically unchanged since Palaeolithic times, and not to an agricultural increase cult or to concepts of a Corn Mother or Corn Maidens. In summary, according to Morss, the principal functions of clay figurines were use in increase cults, or as dolls, victim images used in sorcery, and religious icons. Diffusion of the use of clay figurines from the Southwest to the lower Pecos area can be ruled out on the basis of the present data since the lower Pecos specimens predate the sample studied by Morss. Furthermore, the cultural systems producing the figurines in the Southwest differed markedly from that of the Lower Pecos Archaic. No cultural connection between the samples from the two areas is suggested, but functional parallels will be explored. The use of the lower Pecos specimens as dolls cannot be discounted, nor can it be supported at this time. The interpretation that they represent victim images used in sorcery or religious icons begs for information about the witchcraft and religion of the Lower Pecos Archaic which we do not have. Their use as objects in increase cults will, however, be given additional attention. Considering technological and environmental variables, a critical factor determining group survival in the lower Pecos would be maintaining a low population density. The population could have been kept down by culturally instituted demographic regulating devices. At least it is predictable that some form of demographic controls, such as infanticide, senilicide, sexual taboos, or complex exogamous marriage patterns were practiced. Historic Indian groups in the Coahuiltecan region immediately to the east practiced female infanticide (Ruecking 1955). This and other demographic regulating devices were not uncommon in hunter-gatherer societies having extractive technologies approximating that of the Lower Pecos Archaic (cf. Birdsell 1968). Thus the use of figurines in lower Pecos human increase rites should not be emphasized. The absence of plant domestication in any form in the area would rule out an agricultural fertility cult, corn maidens, and Earth Mother symbols. Moreover not all figurines are necessarily female forms. Diffusion from early agricultural centers is unlikely because clay figurines of equal age are unknown in surrounding regions. Shafer] 155</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Given the cultural context, it is also possible that the figurines served in increase cults for nonhuman economic resources such as replacement of harvested animals and plants (cf. Levine 1957). Muensterberger (1971) notes that ghosts, gods, demons, and other mythological creatures generally assume the appearance of humans or animals in "primitive" societies because man reflects in his art his own ideas about the world. Another explanation for the figurines in the Lower Pecos Archaic is that they served in rituals conducted to restore or preserve health. This function was suggested by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1964) for clay figurines in Colombia on the basis of his observations among the Choc6 and Cuna Indians. Diseases, according to Choc6 and Cuna beliefs, were thought to be caused by malevolent spirits conceived as having anthropomorphic or zoomorphic shapes. Wooden figurines were used by shamans in curing ceremonies and were usually discarded once the ritual was over. Although the Choco and Cuna are sedentary horticulturists, Riechel-Dolmatoff (1964:240, 241) suggests that: From a cultural-historic point of view it seems very probable that the aetiological, prophylactic, and therapeutic concepts, together with the shamanistic handling of biomorphic figurines, belong essentially on the level of primitive hunting and gathering peoples. Here again, no cultural connection is suggested between Colombian and lower Pecos figurines although a functional parallel might be suggested in view of the archaeological context of the lower Pecos specimens. The occurrence of figurines in middens may suggest that the figurines were discarded along with other paraphernalia (possibly including painted pebbles which may also represent stylistic effigies used in curing rituals) after use. The caching of the 41 VV 456 clay figurines, however, does not necessarily negate their use in curing rituals since those particular specimens may have been stored for reuse (as Reichel-Dolmatoff observed with the Cuna). CONCLUSIONS All reported occurrences of anthropomorphic clay figurines from the lower Pecos area of Texas have been reviewed. The specimens are made of fine silty clay and are, with one possible exception, unfired. The forms are basically similar in that the torso is emphasized; arms, legs, and distinguishable heads are lacking. The specimens appear to have been shaped by hand either by welding short rods of clay together or simply by shaping a small mass of clay. A tentative date range of 2000 B.C. to 200 B.C. has been established for the figurines on the basis of dating associated artifactual material. Several specimens have cone-shaped appliques near one end. These appendages are interpreted as breasts on female forms. Incised or painted decorations occur on some of the presumed female forms; it is suggested that the decorations represent social status markings. The use or use s that the figurines served in the Lower Pecos Archaic is conjectural, but their use in human increase cults, a function commonly attributed to similar artifacts elsewhere, is questioned. Alternate explanations that the figurines served either in increase cults for nonhuman resources or in curing rituals are not discounted since supernatural beings and forces sometimes take on anthropomorphic forms in the art of "primitive" societies.
