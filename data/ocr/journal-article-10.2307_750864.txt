<plain_text><page sequence="1">LORENZO VALLA'S DE VERO FALSOQUE BONO, LACTANTIUS AND ORATORICAL SCEPTICISM* By Letizia A. Panizza Lorenzo Valla's De vero falsoque bono is a piece of forensic oratory written in a dazzling and often exhausting polemical style which he never repeated: it elaborately expresses the thoughts about man, morality and human hap- piness to which Valla remained true throughout his life.1 Although De vero falsoque bono engaged his attention for roughly his twenty most productive years (1430o-50) and although three--one scholar says four-versions are established, the structure, style, and content stay substantially the same. To be sure, Valla polishes, reworks or deletes from passages the better to emphasize what he has already formulated. Other alterations concern the title, the place of the debate and the main speakers.2 As Valla explains he is engaging in battle as a Christian orator in order to rout Stoicizing contemporaries and near-contemporaries-Valla claims to have been present at some of their conversations-who while avowedly Christian speak of virtue and the ultimate good or happiness for man as if Christianity were superfluous or even inferior to classical pagan morality. To the ultimate good of the Stoics, the honestum or virtue practised for its own sake, Valla will oppose that of the Epicureans, voluptas, on the grounds that voluptas comes closer to Christian happiness, which is superior to either pagan ideal.3 The surest guide to this Christian happiness is the Bible, especially St. Paul's Epistles.4 Valla plunged with greater force, thoroughness and originality than his rivals into the current humanist controversies on the relative merits of classical ethical systems and their possible reconciliation or opposition to Christianity.5 He was, however, not only addressing men of his own time and culture; he was literally over- turning a widespread tradition of Stoic moral philosophy grounded in the Latin writings of Cicero and, above all, Seneca. In this tradition, firmly established in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a filtered and distorted brand of Stoicism appeared respectably allied to Christian ascetic teachings, * An earlier version of this article was read at the Warburg Institute in December 1972.

Set in Rome, the dia- logue presents the ageing and venerated humanist Leonardo Bruni as the Stoic spokesman; Antonio Beccadelli, 'il Panormita', as the Epicurean; and Niccol6 Niccoli as the Christian. Subsequent versions-the second was com- pleted by 1433 and the third between 1444 and I449-are set in Pavia where Valla taught from I431 to 1433. Catone Sacco, a jurist of high reputation at the University, takes the part of the Stoic; Maffeo Vegio a learned poet who wrote an additional Book to Virgil's Aeneid and who later became a priest, the part of the Epicurean; and Antonio da Rho, a Franciscan friar who succeeded Gasparino Barzizza as Professor of Rhetoric at Milan in 1431, that of the Christian. The title was altered to De verofalsoque bono and also to De vero bono.8 Catone Sacco, Maffeo Vegio and Antonio da Rho were friends of Valla at the time, and are explicitly depicted as upright, devout and learned men who have mastered the requisite skills of oratory.9 Like Valla they have not been seduced into uncritical fondness for pagan philosophy. Although various versions and mixtures of versions were printed in Louvain, Paris, Cologne and Basle, none was published in Italy until the critical edition a few years ago.1' Valla's work was misunderstood even in his lifetime. His bold defence of a discredited philosophical system, of a voluptas even interpreted as heavenly, shocked some; the requirements of his novel style made the main features of his debate difficult to grasp. Valla defended De verofalsoque bono against accusa- tions of heresy in 1444, and again a year later, in an Apologia directed to Pope Eugenius IV. The virulent attack of a fellow-humanist, Poggio Bracciolini, provoked Valla to reply with an equally virulent invective-a genre in which he proved himself second to none." Much has been done in recent years to dispel misunderstanding. Several detailed studies and critical editions have established the cultural background of De vero falsoque bono and the specific authors and works which were Valla's targets; his contribution to the reform of Biblical studies, by comparing the Latin of the New Testament with the original Greek; his own deep religious convictions-no one now seriously doubts that the Christian view in Book III represents his own; his fusion of 6 See K.-D.

PANIZZA rhetoric and dialectic into a reformed oratory; and the subordination of philosophy to eloquence as the most effective means of bringing out the truth. However, an understanding of the admittedly puzzling presentation of the Stoic and Epicurean sides, and above all an understanding of why the style of De verofalsoque bono is peculiar to this treatise alone and to no other, is still not complete.12 I wish to suggest that we can make more sense of De verofalsoque bono if we recognize that Valla is using-reviving, in fact, for the first time in the Renaissance-a brand of oratory which he learned first and foremost from the fourth-century Latin Church Father Lactantius. This is characterized by the adoption of forensic strategies of the Academic sceptics which, exemplified by Socrates, the father of scepticism, and Carneades, its ablest orator, are judged by Lactantius the best suited to the Christian orator bent on under- mining the claims of pagan philosophy to truth. Indeed, Valla not only borrows strategies but also draws most of his arguments against Stoics and Epicureans from Lactantius. Valla demonstrates that other Church Fathers shared the same confidence in such strategies when dealing with pagan adversaries, so his own use of them in a similar situation should ensure his effectiveness. Since Valla does not deal with his adversaries as pagans else- where, this special brand of oratorical scepticism is fitting only to De . . . bono. His careful matching of style to purpose constitutes the most original feature of the work, and deserves the closest attention. The orator and Academic scepticism Throughout his life Valla (1407-57) upheld the superiority of the orator in the hierarchy of learning. As master of eloquence, the orator had at his disposal a body of linguistic skills pertaining to spoken and written expression, including thorough training in a wide range of matters of style and argument. Cicero and Quintilian were the finest Latin masters of the theory, which was then best exemplified in Latin classics, pagan and Christian. Neither the philosopher nor the theologian-at the top of the medieval ladder-could exercise his discipline competently without it. If someone undertakes to write about theology, Valla declares, it matters little, if at all, whether he is learned in some other discipline. 'But if he is ignorant of eloquence, I hold that he is completely unworthy to speak about theology.' The same could be said for IV Pontificem maximum Apologia', can be found in Opera omnia, Basle 1543, PP- 795-80 I, and exists in an Italian translation in Radetti, pp. 429-54. It is significant that when the French humanist and evangelical Josse Badius came to publish the first version, De voluptate, in Paris in 1512, he expressed deep reserva- tions about Books I and II because of Valla's praise of pleasure, and judged Book III only worthy of being read by a Christian. Re- ported by Lorch, Introduction, xv-xvi. Valla's invectives against Poggio Bracciolini, Bartolommeo Fazio and Antonio da Rho can be found in Opera omnia, Basle 154o and [543. Valla quarrelled with da Rho because he thought da Rho plagiarized his Elegan- tiarum linguae latinae libri sex, Valla's dictionary of good Latin usage which brought him more fame than any other work. 12 In addition to works mentioned in notes I and 4, see S.

Two landmarks in this movement were the discovery in 1417 of the complete text of Quintilian's Institutio oratoria, known earlier only partially; and, four years later, of Cicero's complete rhetorical works. Valla's first composition, a comparison of Cicero and Quintilian on the training of the orator, shows both his absorption in current enthusiasms and his ability to judge issues independently, with a tendency to controversy: Valla prefers Quintilian to Cicero, contrary to the taste of his day.14 By the time he com- pletes the first version of De ... bono, he also shows that he has a better grasp than his contemporaries of the connexion between oratory and tech- niques of argument associated with the Academy, the name given in Latin literature to the sceptic school of philosophy. Here I shall sketch briefly the features of oratorical scepticism as they appear in Cicero and Quintilian's works on oratory; but as Valla bases his knowledge of these techniques also on Lactantius, who refers to Cicero's more specifically sceptical works such as Academica, De natura deorum and De fato, all available to Valla, I shall refer to these as well. Significantly, Valla's first major work puts the techniques into practice in their most concentrated form; only later does he set forth the theory. 15 What do we learn then from Cicero and Quintilian on the relation of the orator to the Academy? The orator, first of all, does not care which philo- sophical school is the truest, but which is best suited to the needs of his case, whether pleading in court or debating moral and political issues (De oratore, 13 'Ac mea quidem sententia, si quis ad scribendum in theologia accedat, parvi refert an aliquam aliam facultatem afferat an non; nihil enim fere cetera conferunt. At qui ignarus eloquentiae est, hunc indignum prorsus qui de theologia loquatur existimo.' Preface to Book IV of Elegantiarum Libri, in E. Garin, ed., Prosatori Latini del Quattrocento, Milan 1952, p. 620. This Preface is a succinct summary of Valla's views. 14 See R. Sabbadini, 'Guarino Veronese e le opere rettoriche di Cicerone', Rivista di filologia e d'istruzione classica, 1885, pp. 425-34; La storia del Ciceronianismo, Turin 1886; Le scoperte dei codici latini e greci ne' secoli XIV e XV, Florence 1905-14, facsimile reprint, 1967, 2 vols. J. Seigel, op. cit., ch. I, 'The Ciceronian Model'. On the importance of Quintilian for Valla, see Camporeale, who gives fullest account of what is known of De comparatione Ciceronis Quintilianique, unfortunately no lon- ger extant, pp. 89-93. It was definitely com- pleted by Valla's twenty-third year, p. 91. See also Mancini, p. 17. 15 The main Latin source for scepticism is Cicero's Academica, about the spread of which in the Renaissance see C. Schmitt, Cicero Scepticus, The Hague 1971. For the later spread of scepticism from Greek sources, see R. H. Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Descartes, New York 1964. There is no evidence that Valla used, or needed to use, Greek sources for De ... bono. I take scepticism to mean the impossibility of certain knowledge because of the mind's inability to grasp the real nature of things. Although the sceptic combats dogmatism, he does hold some knowledge possible; hence the impor- tance of methods of argument. The Academy is usually associated with a milder form of scepticism. See the recent studies of M. Dal Pra, Lo Scetticismo greco, 2nd edn., Rome 1975, 2 vols., C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism, Ber- keley 1969, and A. A. Long, Hellenistic Philosophy. Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics, London 1974. For the presence of Academic scep- ticism in Valla's later Dialecticae Disputationes (the first version in particular, Repastinatio dialecticae et philosophiae of 1439, confirms much of Valla's De ... bono, method and content) and the reform of dialectic in the Renaissance, see L. Jardine, 'L.V. and the Intellectual Origins of Humanist Dialectic', Journal of the History of Philosophy, xv, April 1977, pp. 143-64.</page><page sequence="5">80 LETIZIA A. PANIZZA III, 64). In these respects the Academy is best (III, 71). The Academy's chief appeal lies in its practice of arguing at extreme length on either side, in utramque partem, although its fame was greater for pleading contra, 'it being an accepted tradition of the Academy always and against all comers to be of the opposition in debate' (I, 84).16 Because the Academy is more interested in methodology than doctrine, it requires its followers, as Cicero himself explains, to master all systems of philosophy, since only by arguing for and against all schools will the truth emerge (De nat. deor., I, 11). He himself was not able to attain such an ideal, but it should nevertheless be attempted. The orator takes from the philosophical schools what he needs. If he borrows more from the Academy, it should not be forgotten that he repays the loan by uniting to its subtlety his own copious and flowing style (De fato, ii, 3). Similar to his Academic sceptic, Cicero's orator is neither a dogmatist nor a complete doubter. One model for the orator is Socrates, the father of Academic sceptics. Arcesilas is said to have brought into the Academy the Socratic practice of hiding one's own opinions in order to argue against those put forward by others (De oratore, III, 6o, 67). Understating one's own case and lending greater weight to opponents' arguments is also Socratic. Cicero translates this Etwol as dissimulatio (Academica, II, 15). Irony is an important tool in the orator's bag of witticisms, facetiae; and its ties with Socrates evident: Irony too gives pleasure, when your words differ from your thoughts ... when the whole tenor of your speech shows you to be solemnly jesting, what you think differing continuously from what you say. ... Socrates far surpassed all others for polished wit in this irony or dissembling. This is a most refined kind of humour, seasoned with austerity (De oratore, II, 269-70).17 Irony as serious play, as knowing dissimulation, exercises a powerful attrac- tion on Valla. Cicero's other model, the leading figure of the Academic sceptics in more recent times is Carneades, the perfect orator (De oratore, III, 68, 71). He recalls the embassy to Rome in 155 B.C. of Diogenes the Stoic, Critolaus the Peri- patetic and Carneades the Academic again in the context of the appeal of various schools. Diogenes is of least interest to the orator because of his obscure arguments and dull style; Critolaus fares better, but the Peripatetics do not value the art of debate. The Academics, on the other hand, consider this the only thing worth cultivating (II, I55-60). As for Carneades, 'the extra- ordinary power and diversity of his oratory would be extremely to our liking; since . . . he supported no contention without proving it, and attacked none which he did not overthrow' (II, 161).18 Like Socrates, Carneades combines 16 'hic enim mos erat patrius Academiae, adversari semper omnibus in disputando'. Latin and English quotes from Loeb Classical Library editions of Cicero and Quintilian. I have occasionally altered English transla- tions. 17 'Urbana etiam dissimulatio est, cum alia dicuntur ac sentias . . . cum toto genere orationis severe ludas, cum aliter sentias ac loquere. ... Socratem opinor in hac ironia dissimulantiaque longe lepore et humanitate omnibus praestitisse. Genus est perelegans et cum gravitate salsum.' 18 'Carneadi vero vis incredibilis illa dicendi et varietas perquam esset optanda nobis, qui nullam umquam ... rem defendit, quam non probarit, nullam oppugnavit, quam non everterit.'</page><page sequence="6">VALLA, LACTANTIUS AND SCEPTICISM 8i wide learning with consummate skill; but whereas the accent with Socrates is on dissimulatio, with Carneades it is on toughness and vigour in debate, his forenses nervi (III, 80o). Carneades loathes all three branches of Stoic philosophy: logic, ethics and physics. He attacks Stoic divine providence and theology in general for the purpose of arousing interest in the truth of the matter (De nat. deor., II, 162; III, 44; I, 4). He overturns Stoic logic and denies that the Stoic sage has certain knowledge (Academica, II, 78). When making moral decisions probability alone is possible (II, 99ff.). In a section that may well have inspired Valla's composi- tion of Books I and II of De ... bono, Cicero has Carneades opposing the Stoics on the ultimate good for man and supporting an Epicurean view: The Old Academy defined the end as living the moral life while enjoying those primary things which nature recommends to man. . . . Also Carneades used to put forward the view-not that he held it himself but in order to combat the Stoics with it-that the chief good was to enjoy those things that nature had recommended as primary (II, 131).19 Carneades is also described in the same section as 'constantly defending with so much zeal that he was thought actually to approve it' (II, 139)20 the opinion of Calliphon, a disciple of Epicurus himself, that the final good was a combination of both pleasure (voluptas) and moral goodness (honestas) (II, 131). Thus Carneades supports a union of Epicurean and Stoic ethical ideals in a subordinate relationship: moral goodness pursued for the sake of enjoyment, honestas subordinate to voluptas-the solution of Maffeo Vegio, identified as Carneades, the Epicurean spokesman in Valla's dispute. Quintilian also discusses the question, which school of philosophy is most useful to the orator? He grants that some choose the Academy 'on the ground that its habit of disputing on both sides of a question approaches most nearly to the actual practice of the courts' (12, 2, 25).21 But Quintilian defines per- haps more sharply than Cicero the way in which the orator stands above and beyond any one philosophic code. The orator 'has a greater and nobler aim, to which he directs all his efforts . . . since he is to be made perfect not only in the glory of a virtuous life, but in that of eloquence as well' (12, 2, 27).22 To choose any particular school would fetter his striving for perfection, which requires borrowing from all the best masters of oratory and selecting 'the noblest precepts and the most direct road to virtue as the means for the forma- tion of an upright character' (12, 2, 27).23 Quintilian's orator, by definition, is a good man, and apparently more convinced than Cicero's about right and wrong, innocent and guilty, and what side should be defended or prosecuted. 19 'honeste autem vivere fruentem rebus iis quas primas homini natura conciliet . . . vetus Academia censuit. . . . Introducebat etiam Carneades, non quo probaret sed ut opponeret Stoicis, summum bonum esse frui rebus iis quas primas natura conciliavisset.' 20 Callipho 'cuius quidem sententiam Car- neades ita studiose defensitabat ut eam pro- bare etiam videretur'. 21 'Academiam quidam... credunt, quod mos in utramque partem disserendi ad exercitationem forensium causarum proxime accedat.' 22 'Maius enim est opus atque praestan- tius, ad quod ipse tendit... si quidem est futurus cum vitae, turn etiam eloquentiae laude perfectus.' 23 'moribus vero formandis quam honestis- sima praecepta rectissimamque ad virtutem viam deliget.'</page><page sequence="7">82 LETIZIA A. PANIZZA Quintilian does, however, stress the advantages of the specific Academic method of arguing by contraries in a passage that may also have afforded Valla inspiration for his method in De ... bono. Every now and then, when cir- cumstances arise, it is the duty of the good man to defend falsehood or even injustice that we may recognize and defeat them with greater ease, 'just as the physician who knows all that is harmful will be all the more skilful in pre- scribing remedies' (12, I, 34).24 For the Academicians, although they will argue on either side of a question, do not thereby commit themselves to taking one of these two views as their guide in life to the exclhlsion of the other, while the famous Carneades, who is said to have spoken at Rome in the presence of Cato the Censor, and to have argued against justice with no less vigour than he had argued for justice on the preceding day, was not himself an unjust man. But the nature of virtue is revealed by vice, its opposite; justice becomes yet more manifest from the contemplation of injustice, and there are many other things that are proved by their contraries. Consequently the schemes of his adversaries should be no less well known to the orator than those of the enemy to a commander in the field. But it is even true ... that there may be sound reason why at times a good man who is appearing for the defence should attempt to conceal the truth from the judge (12, I, 35-36).25 The main point for the orator is that he can actually defend truth and virtue better by opposing them in debate to falsehood and vice. The comparisons with the good physician or the commander, convince us all the more of this method's rightness in case we were in doubt, perhaps, about its morality or effectiveness. The last suggestion about concealing the truth allows us to associate argument by contraries and Carneades with Socratic dissembling: oratorical scepticism in a nutshell. Interestingly, Quintilian extends the meaning of irony from a play on words or the tone of a speech to a personal trait: 'a man's whole life may be coloured with irony, as was the case with Socrates, who ... assumed the role of an ignorant man lost in wonder at the wisdom of others' (9, 2, 46).26 Lactantius, the Christian orator, and the Academy Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius (c. 250-c. 325) witnessed both the persecution of Christianity under Diocletian, and its triumph as a tolerated religion under Constantine. A student of Arnobius, one of the first Latin Fathers of the Church, and later teacher of rhetoric in Africa, Lactantius's 24 'quemadmodum remedia melius ad- hibebit, cui nota quae nocent fuerint.' 25 'Neque enim Academici, cum in utram- que disserunt partem, non secundum alteram vivunt, nec Carneades ille, qui Romae audiente Censorio Catone non minoribus viribus contra iustitiam dicitur disseruisse quam pridie pro iustitia dixerat, iniustus ipse vir fuit. Verum et virtus quid sit, adversa ei malitia detegit, et aequitas fit ex iniqui con- templatione manifestior, et plurima contrariis probantur. Debent ergo oratori sic esse adversariorum nota consilia ut hostium im- peratori. Verum et illud, quod prima pro- positione durum videtur, potest adferre ratio, ut vir bonus in defensione causae velit auferre aliquando iudici veritatem.' 26 'vita universa ironiam habere videatur, qualis est visa Socratis; nam ideo dictus e&lt;aoyv, agens imperitum et admiratorem aliorum tanquam sapientium'.</page><page sequence="8">VALLA, LACTANTIUS AND SCEPTICISM 83 fame brought him the appointment of tutor to the Emperor's son Crispus. Constantine himself was apparently influenced: his Oratio ad sanctos, preserved by Eusebius, resembles a summary of Lactantius's teachings. Lactantius dedicated his major work, Divinae institutiones adversus gentes, to Constantine. One of the first attempts to expound Christian doctrine at length in Latin, it undoubtedly provided a model for the City of God of another more famous African teacher of rhetoric, Augustine of Hippo.27 The divinae institutiones of the title, divine principles or rules, refer to the mysteries of religion revealed from heaven which resemble in purpose the institutes or prescriptions of civil law. Just as the latter bring peace to quarrelling citizens, so the former, Lactantius hopes, will bring an end to the strife caused by the superstition of false religions and the errors of false philosophies.28 The polemical nature of the work is indicated by the phrase adversus gentes. Addressing himself to cul- tured pagans well-versed in literature and philosophy, and suspicious of the strange beliefs and inelegant writings of the Christians, Lactantius earned the reputation of refuting error better than affirming the truth.29 Two short works, De opificio dei and De ira dei are usually attached to manuscripts and editions of the Divinae institutiones. The former defends the existence and wisdom of divine providence, using Stoic arguments from Cicero's De natura deorum, against the Epicureans who would have the world ruled by chance. The latter defends an anthropomorphic God who shows love and anger to- wards men, distributing rewards and punishments, against both the Stoics, who deny that anger is ever good, and the Epicureans, who deny that the gods are concerned with men's actions. Neglected during the Middle Ages apart from loci on Seneca, Lactantius attracted interest once again in the Italian Renaissance.30 His superb elo- quence, compared by St. Jerome himself to Cicero's, and his wide literary and 27 Critical edition of Div. instit. by S. Brandt, Vienna 189o; English trans. by W. Fletcher, Divine Institutes, Edinburgh 1871. On L. see H. Hagendahl, Latin Fathers and the Classics, G6teborg 1958, pp. 48-88; and R. Pichon, Lactance, Paris 1901. 28 Pichon, pp. 232-3. It may be no coinci- dence that the title echoes Quintilian's Institutio oratoria. Lactantius admired Quin- tilian greatly, and like him upheld a classical Ciceronian style and insisted on the role of eloquence in bringing out the truth. 29 St. Jerome is at the origin of criticisms of L. for this, for lacking a thorough knowledge of Scripture, and for unorthodox ideas about the Holy Spirit. For details, see Brandt, Testimonia, ii, pp. I56-65. Jerome's phrase, 'utinam tam nostra adfirmare potuisset quam facile aliena destruxit!' Ep. LVIII, Io, Brandt, ii, p. 164, is echoed almost word for word by Fletcher in his translation of 1871: 'he appears more successful as an opponent of error than as a maintainer of truth', pp. xi-xii. The Introduction to L. in Migne, Patrologia Latina, vi, Paris 1844, cols. 81-82, accuses L. of gross ignorance of the faith; and more modern evaluation is also unfavourable; cf. J. Quasten, Patrology, ii, Utrecht 1952, PP- 392-410. But as Erasmus realized, perhaps following Valla, L. was speaking 'stilo philo- sophiae', just as Boethius in De consolatione philosophiae, using the weapons of philosophy and oratory. See his dedicatory letter to L., Div. instit., Antwerp 1555, P- 518. According to E. Amann, Dict. de Theo. Cath., Paris 1925, viii, cols. 2428, 2435, L. did not have first- hand knowledge of the Bible but used a compilation of St. Cyprian. 30 Pichon, p. 451. The MS tradition charts the change dramatically: nearly 2o extant MSS from the 8th to before the 13th century; almost 22o from the I4th and especially the 15th centuries.

PANIZZA philosophical learning, all put to the service of Christianity, appealed to humanists who found in him an ally against the uncouth Latin and rudimen- tary classical education of the scholastics.31 Without his knowledge of pagan culture, Lactantius could not have undermined it, Petrarch contends: a senti- ment echoed by Coluccio Salutati in his last letter of March 1406.32 Leonardo Bruni, the Stoic spokesman in Valla's first version of De ... bono, recommends Lactantius as the most outstanding and without doubt the most eloquent Christian writer, in an educational treatise written between 1422 and 1429.33 Antonio da Rho, the Christian spokesman in Valla's subsequent versions, achieved fame as a collector and emendator of Lactantius manuscripts, and the author of a long treatise against his sometimes questionable theological opinions. A summary of da Rho's objections is found in some early printed editions.34 One aspect of his unorthodoxy made him all the more famous: on the authority of Lactantius, Marsilio Ficino was able to integrate the magically-charged texts of the Corpus Hermeticum into his Platonic theology and make Hermes Trismegistus acceptable to Christians as a Gentile prophet.35 In drawing on Lactantius, therefore, for his oratorical scepticism, Valla was making use of a source well known to his contemporaries, but not, as he realized, well understood. Lactantius is the only Father of the Church to adopt a plainly sceptical attitude, derived explicitly from Cicero's Academica and to a far lesser extent from De natura deorum, down to the phrase drawn from Cicero about suspend- ingjudgement, 'adsensus esse retinendos'.36 The Divinae institutiones opens with 31Jerome, Ep.

Rational argument, Lactantius points out (in Book III where he follows the Academics most closely), yields not the fruit of knowledge, scientia, but the meagre harvest of mere conjecture, opinatio. 'Rightly, therefore, did Socrates, and the Academics who followed him, withdraw knowledge, which does not belong to a disputant but a diviner.' If, therefore, philosophers do not have knowledge, 'they do not know the truth, because knowledge is concerned with that which is certain, conjecture with the uncertain.'38 As a believing Christian, of course, Lactan- tius could not and did not advocate scepticism as an end in itself. Truth belongs to God who has made it His gift, available to man in the teachings of revealed religion.39 Lactantius uses scepticism to shake man's confidence in his powers of reason, which he thinks shines most brightly in the area of philosophy, in order to persuade him to embrace the Christian faith. Scepticism, in other words, is a means to fideism. If the pagan orator has cause to ally himself with the Academic sceptics, the Christian orator has even more justification. In battling against pagans, Lactantius claims the original approach of setting aside the evidence of Scripture-divine truth-and arguing with evidence from their own philo- sophers and historians. Tertullian and other Christian writers have defended the faith without success; Cyprian in particular failed with the pagan Demetrianus who 'ought to have been refuted not by the testimonies of Scrip- ture, which he plainly considered vain, fictitious and false, but by arguments and reason.'40 Although inferior to the testimonies of Scripture, arguments and reason are appropriate for a man totally ignorant of the divine: For as an infant is unable, on account of the tenderness of its stomach, to receive the nourishment of solid and strong food, but is supported by liquid and soft milk . . so also it was befitting that this man, because he was not yet capable of receiving divine things, should be presented with human testimonies-that is, of philosophers and historians-in order that he might especially be refuted by his own authorities.41 [Italics mine] Lactantius's comparison between those unfit for the strong food of Scripture and infants needing softer nourishment echoes St. Paul's rebuke to the quarrelling religious factions of Corinth in the very Scriptures Lactantius says the pagan Demetrianus rejects: I . . . could not speak unto you as unto spiritual [men], but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? (I Cor. iii, I-3)42 The association of Paul's carnal Corinthians with Lactantius's supercilious pagans lends the authority of the Apostle to the fundamental strategy of oratorical scepticism, arguing contra; in this case, turning the arguments and authorities of a particular sect against itself-i.e. pointing to inconsistencies and contradictions. If other learned Christian orators follow such a plan of attack, 'no one can doubt that false religions will quickly disappear, and philosophy altogether fall'.43 A similar role for the Christian orator is stressed in the preamble to Book III where Lactantius wishes he were endowed with such power of eloquence that the truth, which 'still lies in obscurity', partly because of philosophers 'who by the perverseness of their minds confuse rather than throw light on it', might all the better emerge, and 'having dispelled and refuted public errors . . . introduce among the human race a brilliant light'. In the battle with philosophers, it could be wished that they 'might be over- powered by us, most of all by their own arms, in which they are accustomed to pride themselves and to place confidence'.44 Since God's message has its own irresistible force, the orator fortunately need not rely solely on his human strength. Indeed, because he combines the force of divine truth with the power of Academic eloquence, the Christian orator should be more invincible than either the pagan armed with eloquence alone or the Christian armed with truth but no eloquence. Lactantius specifies three ways of turning the arguments and authorities of an adversary against him. The first is to catch a philosopher in self- contradiction: thus Arcesilas-Lactantius does not spare even the Academy- cannot at once accuse other philosophers of no knowledge and then claim himself a philosopher on account of the very thing he says others lack: 'having despatched all the philosophers, he pierced himself also with the same sword- point'.45 Lactantius also captures a philosopher contradicting the accepted view of his school. While the Stoics preach that virtue is its own reward, Seneca bestows immortality on virtue.46 A principal Stoic spokesman is thus 42 'Et ego ... non potui vobis loqui quasi spiritualibus, sed quasi carnalibus. Tam- quam parvulis in Christo, lac vobis potum dedi, non escam: nondum enim poteratis: sed nec nunc quidem potestis: adhuc enim carnales estis. Cum enim sit inter vos zelus, et contentio, nonne carnales estis, et secun- dum hominem ambulatis?'

The third way is to surprise philosophers not practising what they preach. Lactantius finds both Cicero and Seneca at fault in thinking that philosophy can teach virtue.47 Moral philosophers busily exhort others to a life of virtue, but if one investigates their own characters 'he will find that they are passionate, covetous, lustful, arrogant, wanton, and, concealing their vices under a show of wisdom, doing those things at home which they had censured in the schools.'48 Both they and their philosophy are discredited. Military metaphors intensify as Lactantius specifies the strategy accom- panying this refutation of one's adversary. If each of the philosophical schools boasts a monopooy of the truth, then, explains Lactantius, all are in this manner destroyed; and as those fabled Sparti of the poets, so these men mutually slaughter one another, so that no one of them remains; which happens on this account, because they have a sword, but have no shield. If, therefore, the sects individually are convicted of folly by the judgement of many sects, it follows that all are found to be vain and empty; and thus philosophy consumes and destroys itself.49 The comparison to Sparti is deliberately scornful: these were the armed warriors who sprung up from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus, the founder of Thebes. Their truculence was such that they were set fighting over a worth- less stone thrown among them by Cadmus, to their mutual destruction. Once again one detects St. Paul in the background, urging the Christians of Ephesus to 'put on the armour of God' so as to stand against the wiles of the devil. In contrast to the philosophers who have a sword but no shield, the armed Christian has both the shield of faith and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.50 Thus armed, the Christian orator cannot lose. Lactantius adds a new dimension to Cicero's perfect orator, Carneades, that of the Gentile prophet of Christianity, an instrument of divine providence conveying to the Romans that, since genuine virtue must be rooted in true religion, no pagan Roman, and certainly not the Roman state, can have acted virtuously. As for Roman justice, whether regarded as the chief cardinal virtue for the individual or as the characteristic virtue of the Republic, Carneades alone grasped that it had never existed. When Carneades came to Rome,51 he argued on the first day in favour of justice; but on the second, 47 3, 15, I. Fletcher, p. 171. 48 'si quis mores eorum diligenter inquirat, inveniet iracundos cupidos libidinosos adro- gantes protervos et sub obtentu sapientiae sua vitia celantes, tum domi facientes ea quae in scolis arguissent.' 3, 15, 8.

PANIZZA against: 'not indeed with the gravity of a philosopher, whose judgment ought to be firm and settled, but as it were by a kind of oratorical exercise of dis- puting on both sides'.52 He was able to refute his own arguments because 'it was very easy to shake justice, having no roots, inasmuch as there was then none on earth that its nature or qualities might be perceived by philosophers'.53 Carneades, recognized by Lactantius as a virulent enemy of Stoicism, argued that the Romans never acted for the sake of virtue alone, the honestum, but enacted laws to their own advantage, the utile, in the sure knowledge that to do the good and just act would be foolishness.54 (According to Stoic ethics, as described in Cicero's De oficiis, there can be no conflict between what is right and what is expedient, between the honestum and the utile, for the pursuit of the former will by necessity bring the latter.)55 Carneades himself was an upright man, and deeply concerned with justice, indispensable for governing a state. However, explaining the apparent foolishness of worldly justice, this sceptic came close to the designs of God who wanted 'justice wrapped up in the appearance of folly, and removed from the eyes of men' because their justice 'had no foundation from heaven'.56 Although a pagan he grasped that there was more to justice than he could understand; therefore he wished the truth to lie hidden in accordance with the Academic doctrine that 'nothing can be fully understood'.'5 If we wonder why God wills virtue to lie concealed under the character of folly, Lactantius answers that He wants to show the vanity of earthly superstitions and wisdom.58 Once more we hear echoes of St. Paul's admonishment to the Corinthians that 'the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain' (I Cor. iii, 2o-2 I).59 The fusion of the skills of oratorical scepticism with the gift of divine truth raises the Christian orator to the lofty position of judge of the true and the false, the good and the bad, in human affairs where opinatio reigns. Even better than Cicero's Academic orator will he argue pro and contra all schools of philosophy; even more than Quintilian's will he argue by contraries to bring out the good and the true. Because he sees the whole truth, he can recognize that parts of it have been divided up among the different sects; and can therefore grant that 'no sect was so much out of the way, and no philosopher so vain, as not to see something' of it, a vision the individual schools themselves cannot possess 'while they are mad with the desire of contradicting, while they defend their own arguments even though false, and overthrow those of others 52 'non quidem philosophi gravitate, cuius firma et stabilis debet esse sententia, sed quasi oratorio exercitii genere in utramque partem disserendi.' 5, 14, 4.

He breaks down his opponents' system into elements some of which he then reconstitutes into a new whole, all the while concealing from his opponents his own unshakable beliefs towards which he inexorably drives them. Lorenzo Valla, 'De ... bono', and Christian oratorical scepticism Valla's compact Proem in which he speaks in propria persona contains the essence of his method and content. From the first he states unequivocally that he treats the supreme question in ethics-the true and the false good or ultimate aim of human endeavour-from the viewpoint of a religious believer for whom there is one good in this life and a higher one in the life to come, so related that one rises as by a step from one to the other. 'Our entire oration aims at this second good.'61 Of the two means to this end, religion and virtue, Valla leaves aside the former which has been dealt with amply by others, especially the Church Fathers Lactantius and Augustine-significantly the only two authors named in the Proem. Lactantius, 'as one who came first, seems to have refuted false religions with greater distinction'; Augustine, 'to have confirmed the true one'.62 Of course, these same two authors have also dealt with the virtues needed to reach the good, but alas there are men of wicked disposition who will not listen to the truth. Valla compares himself to a doctor who, when his stubborn patients refuse the best medicine, searches out another cure, admittedly less potent, but more likely to be accepted. 'And so it often happens that lesser remedies bring about a better state of health.'63 Valla first defines his patients as 'depraved spirits', then as 'learned men', some his own contemporaries whom he has heard declaring themselves so overwhelmed by the goodness and wisdom of pagans that they cannot under- stand why they are not saved like Christians. These supposed Christians imitate such pagans and exhort others to do likewise, but: 'What else is this ... than to confess that Christ has come to the world in vain; to admit indeed that he has not come at all?'64 Primed by Lactantius, we should not be surprised to learn Valla's 'new kind of method' for those sick souls who will not accept the strong medicine of the Fathers of the Church and presumably Scripture as well: when his adversaries attribute so much to pagan antiquity as to claim that 'it possesses all the virtues, I shall make clear, taking the opposite side, e contra, not with Christian arguments but with ones from these philosophers themselves, that pagan antiquity did nothing virtuously, nothing rightly'.65 When Valla claims a new method, he speaks ironically. 60 'Nullam sectam fuisse tam deviam neque philosophorum quemquam tam inanem qui non viderit aliquid ex vero. sed dum contra- dicendi studio insaniunt, dum sua etiam falsa defendunt, aliorum etiam vera subvertunt.' 7, 7, 2-3.

PANIZZA By substituting for Lactantius's food metaphors ones about medicine, Valla skilfully blends Lactantius with Quintilian's recommendation to argue by contraries or opposites, and aligns himself with oratorical scepticism.66 Valla's application of Lactantius's strategy has additional sting: Lactantius was refuting genuine pagans; Valla, Christians who had slipped into or taken on ways resembling paganism. 'The work is great and extremely difficult,' continues Valla, dissembling, 'and I am not sure whether it is not more audacious than anything written by those before me.' Has any other writer set himself the task of showing that 'not only the Athenians, the Romans and all the rest who receive the highest praise, but also those very teachers of virtue were far removed from it both in their actions and in their understanding of it'? Nevertheless, 'forgetting my weakness, and seized by a longing to defend our republic, that is the Christian one, I confess I have at last realized that the completion of what we undertake depends not on ourselves but on God'.67 This pious sentiment, the contrary of the self-sufficiency of the Stoic who relies solely on his own firmness of will, his constantia, to bring to completion whatever he undertakes, deftly reformu- lates the opening sentences of the most famous defence against pagans, Augustine's City of God: 'That most glorious society and celestial city of God's faithful.., .have I undertaken to defend in this work', begins Augustine, 'against all those who prefer their own gods before this city's founder. The work is great and difficult, but God is our helper.'68 By connecting Augustine to Lactantius, the latter more in a context of refutation, the former more in a context of defence, Valla reveals that he is by no means putting Lactantius and Augustine aside, but is concealing his use of them from his adversaries who would otherwise reject them. Like Lactantius, Augustine demolishes the claims of all pagan moral philosophers that man's ultimate good or happiness can be found in this life, turning against them the arguments of one of their own, Varro. Augustine pointedly notes that he was praised in the Academica, in which Cicero 'doubts everything', as 'without doubt the most learned of all'.69 Throughout the City of God, Augustine uses the same techniques as antiquitati, gentilium dico, ut eos omnibus virtutibus affectos esse contendant, ego e contra planum faciam, non nostris, sed ipsorum philo- sophorum rationibus nihil cum virtute gentilita- tem, nihil recte fecisse.' 4. 66 Supra, pp. 82, 85. 67 'Magnum opus profecto et arduum et haud scio an magis audax quam aliquod su- periorum.

Valla's opening affirmation of a good imperfect in this world, complete in the next, reflects Augustine's central motif. Behind Lactantius's new method we discerned the authority of St. Paul and the Scriptures; so also behind St. Augustine and even more explicitly behind Valla's reformulation of Augustine, we are aware of reliance on God as helper. Paul frequently boasts of his weakness-Valla uses the Vulgate's infirmitas-for then he can rely utterly on the power of God to accomplish the task of preaching God's message.70 From the chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians where Paul talks of liquid food-the passage incorporated by Lactantius-the apostle also confesses that he may have planted and another watered, but the growth and completion of the harvest belongs to God.71 In the City of God Augustine not only combats pagans with their own weapons; he also refutes them and affirms the Christian cause by using St. Paul and Scripture. Augustine even adduces the practice of Paul as proof that figures of speech incorporating antithesis are the most elegant. Valla follows all these ways of disputing by contraries. As one following in the footsteps of Lactantius, Augustine commends him for using pagan learning well.72 In the following section, Valla chooses as models in his Christian oratorical warfare David, the inexperienced youth who cut off Goliath's head, and his companion Jonathan, who routed the Philistine army. They represent his two principal strategies: These youths were fighting with the shield of faith and the sword of the word of God, and those who are thus armed never leave battle without victory. ... And just as the former [David] used the sword he had seized from his enemy to kill him with, and as the latter [Jonathan] incited his adversaries to take up arms against each other, so we hope and think that we shall partly slaughter the allophiles, that is, the philosophers, with their own sword-point, and partly incite them to internecine warfare and their mutual destruction.73 The closeness of the above passage to Lactantius-the military imagery, the same key words for 'slaughter' and 'sword-point'-iugulare and mucro- 70 See esp. 2 Cor. xi, I6-30, ending: 'Si gloriari oportet, quae infirmitatis meae sunt, gloriabor'; and xii, i-io, ending: 'Cum enim infirmor, tunc potens sum.' 71 'Ego plantavi, Apollo rigavit, sed Deus incrementum dedit.

PANIZZA and the interweaving of St. Paul's shield of faith and the sword of the word of God-is easy to see.74 Valla's introduction of David and Jonathan is only partially original. In a letter to a Roman orator Magnus, St. Jerome defends the use of pagan literature by Christian authors, and holds up St. Paul himself as the proper model. St. Paul, 'the leader of the Christian army and unrivalled orator acting for Christ's cause', suitably turned an inscription he came across by chance on the Areopagus in Athens to the service of the faith, 'for he had learned from David indeed to twist the sword from the hands of the enemy, and cut off the head of arrogant Goliath by its sharp edge'. In the same letter Jerome praises Lactantius for precisely the same method.75 The figure of Jonathan, which neatly matches the two strategies of the Christian orator to the two friends, is Valla's own. By means of it, he sets himself and De ... bono into the tradition sanctioned by Lactantius, by Augustine and Jerome-both of whom commend Lactantius-and by St. Paul. By devising a double pun on allophili-that is, Valla says, the philosophi- he conceals and reveals his own adversaries and those of David and Jonathan. His philosophi, 'lovers of wisdom', are identified instead as allophili, 'lovers of something else', that is, other than wisdom. What the 'something other' is will become shortly apparent. A further play joins allophili, and Allophuloi, the name in the Greek Septuagint Bible for the Philistines.76 Just as David and Jonathan won not only because of clever strategy but mainly because they had the shield of faith to defend them and the sword of the word of God to attack with, so too the Christian orator triumphs-in this case, Valla himself. The method of arguing contra determines the structure of the three Books, all aimed, Valla says, at 'repelling and dispersing the Stoic race'. Stoic moral philosophy and its adherents past and present are the chief enemy for the Christian orator defending the true good; therefore, 'since the Stoics assert most vigorously of all the notion of virtue for its own sake, the honestum, to us it appears enough to establish these as our adversaries, taking up the defence of the Epicureans.'77 Lactantius set all sects of antiquity against one another; Valla, the acknowledged adversaries Stoics and Epicureans. The Stoics argued that the honestum was the only good; Valla will argue the contrary thesis in Book I: that pleasure is the only good. In Book II, he will argue the contradictory thesis: that the honestum of the philosophers is not even a good. Showing off his stylistic virtuosity in a series of antitheses-the figures of speech 74 Supra, nn. 45 and 49. 75 Ep.

Valla's phrase 'partim suo mucrone iugule- mus' binds Jerome and Lactantius to himself and Academic strategy. 76 Both Lactantius and Augustine play on the etymology of philosophia and philosophi. L., Div. instit. 3, 2, 3-5, argues that if philo- sophy is the love or search for wisdom, then by definition the philosopher is not yet wise and wisdom has not yet been found. Augus- tine, City of God, VIII, i, argues that since God is true wisdom, a philosopher ought to be a lover of God. But so-called philosophers are far from living up to what their name implies S. .

For the Stoics and their followers who cannot admit pleasure as a good, and for the Epicureans who cannot admit any pleasure beyond this life, here lies the final refutation. Valla closes the Proem with a few apposite remarks about his style. He will mingle the frequently 'harsh, vehement, and aggressive' mode of the first two Books with more playful and even licentious motifs-especially in the defence of pleasure in Book I since 'what could be farther removed from a celebration of pleasure than a grave and heavy style?'s80 Dedicated as an Academic orator to argue always against all comers, Valla commits himself to that toughness in debate, theforenses nervi, of Carneades. The Proem alone abounds in negatives and antitheses (see n. 78) and violent metaphors of warfare. At the same time, by his dissembling and admitted playfulness he allies himself with that other Academic paragon, Socrates, whose style Cicero called a solemn jesting.81 That oratorical scepticism is Valla's chosen method is confirmed through- out the De ... bono. In Book I, for instance, just after Catone Sacco's 'Stoic' speech, and before his own defence of Epicurean voluptas, Maffeo Vegio pro- claims that one should feel free to pick arguments from any source. He him- self is proud to have been trained not in philosophy but in the higher rites of oratory and poetry because 'philosophy is like a soldier or a tribune serving under the commander-in-chief, oratory, the queen'.82 Cicero allows one to speak freely about philosophical matters without being tied to any particular sect; Maffeo Vegio would like him to have gone even further, and claimed back from philosophy its oratorical furnishings. If Cicero had been opposed, he should have 78 'Non modo enim anteferimus epicureos, abiectos homines et contemptos, honesti cus- todibus, verum etiam probamus hos ipsos sapientie sectatores non virtutem sed umbram virtutis, non honestatem sed vanitatem, non officium sed vitium, non sapientiam sed demen- tiam fuisse sectatos, meliusque fuisse facturos si voluptati operam nisi dederunt dedissent.' 9. 79 Supra, p. 87, and n. 48. 80 'illud genus acre, vehemens, incitatum'; 'Prioribus et presertim primo admixta sunt quedam hilariora et prope dixerim licentiosa, quod ... quid magis alienum est ab agenda causa voluptatis quam mesta oratio et severa'? 8. 81 Valla merely hints at Carneades and Socrates in the Proem; explicit later references assure us that it is correct to infer their presence there. 82 'philosophia velut miles est aut tribunus sub imperatrice oratione et ... regina.' I, x, 3.</page><page sequence="19">94 LETIZIA A. PANIZZA drawn the sword entrusted to him by eloquence, the queen of all things, against thieving philosophers, and have punished the evil-doers severely. How much more obviously, more seriously, more magnificently, indeed, are philosophical matters treated by orators than by obscure, filthy, and anemic philosophers !83 As might be expected, Vegio insists that both he and Catone Sacco speak as orators. In his preference for the freedom of the Academy we discern not only Cicero but Lactantius, revealed by the image of the orator drawing his sword against the philosopher.84 There is also a certain serious playfulness on Valla's part in debunking philosophers with such relish. True forensic debate, Vegio further clarifies, is not concerned about which advocate wins, but 'that from their litigation truth or justice comes to light'.85 The orator merely interested in winning is unworthy of the name; indeed 'he is not truly an orator, however eloquent, who is not also a good man ... nothing is more dangerous than a learned and wicked man'. As an orator Catone Sacco 'must not swear alle- giance to any sect'.86 In Book III the Christian spokesman Antonio da Rho repeats that the orator rather than the philosopher 'forces the truth to come forth even when it lies hidden', the view of Cicero, Quintilian, and Lac- tantius.87 For da Rho oratory is the treasure worth salvaging from pagan culture, to which, he says, 'I grant the merit of letters, of learning, and what has always been of greatest value, the knowledge of eloquence; I deny, how- ever, that antiquity ever arrived at wisdom and at the recognition of true virtue.'88 Valla's intention to have his spokesmen behave as Christian orators, who judge, use, and order philosophy as they see fit, ought to persuade us that neither Catone Sacco nor Maffeo Vegio speak as genuine Stoics or Epicureans. In fact immediately after Sacco's 'Stoic' oration, Vegio smiles because no true Stoic was present.89 He asks to be excused for now speaking as an Epicurean against a Stoic since none of the present company is a member of either sect. We are reminded of Quintilian's good orator who may on occasion take up vice and falsehood to the point of concealing truth-in order to better reveal their opposites.90 Valla wants us to be aware, however, not only of the Socratic discrepancy between what Vegio and Sacco argue and what they really believe, but also of a further distinction between their Stoic and Epi- 83 'si qui repugnassent, gladium illum quem a regina rerum eloquentia acceperat in latrunculos philosophos strinxisset et male meritos male mulctasset.

Vegio points out indeed that a true Stoic would find much to complain of in Sacco's supposed praise of the Stoic honestum.91 Referring in turn to Vegio, Antonio da Rho affirms that he has spoken less as Epicurus than as Socrates.92 With an awareness of this sceptical context Book I falls into place. Both the 'Stoic' and the 'Epicurean' speech must prove its main thesis, that pleasure is the only good; and both refute the contrary: that the Stoic honestum is the only good. Sacco's Stoic defence is only apparent. As Vegio remarks, Sacco has spoken contra his own cause, and pro that of pleasure.93 Catone Sacco, indeed, delivers a gloomy dirge about the depravity of nature inclining mankind more to vice-that is, pleasure-and about the impossibility of becoming virtuous anyway with the number of vices so outweighing that of the virtues. For the Stoic, all deeds not deemed perfect virtue are vice. Though marked by touches of black humour, the speech has the calculated effect of turning us from such an unattainable and unattractive goal towards the opposite one of pleasure. Why, Sacco wonders, have only a few Greek philosophers and Roman heroes possessed eyes of the mind sharp enough to discern the true form of virtue? Mankind in general has remained enveloped in the darkness of passion and error. It is baffling why the human spirit, which the Stoics con- sider divine, perversely runs after the frivolous and useless-in one word, evil- and clings to it 'rather than pursuing and clinging to true and sound virtue, by which means alone we approach the gods and-if we may speak thus- become gods'.94 Even if their virtue goes unappreciated, its very sternness evokes Sacco's admiration for the Stoics, 'whom our Seneca rightly and elegantly wished to be regarded among other philosophers as the males among the females'.95 Cicero and Aristotle have certainly contributed to the rarity of Stoic virtue by dwelling on virtue as a mean between extremes: moving away from one vice, you risk falling into another. 'Against this foe, it is not enough to be two-faced like Janus, but one must also have two other hands behind, a second pair of feet-in short, another whole body!'96 The demands of the Stoic honestum surpass those of a monstrous tyrant, although, Sacco concedes, referring to himself and the assembled company, 'by strivings and vigils more than human reason can bear, we have swum away [from the shipwreck of vice]'. He pities those less energetic souls unable to swim: 'You know how large their number is, those masses whom we appropriately designate with the customary term "the ignorant crowd".'97 91 'Illi enim te reprehenderent', I, viii, 2, and n. 89. 92 III, vii, 5. 93 I, viii, I. 94 'iuste nimirum admirari videbor quid cause sit cur humana ingenia, que divina esse volumus, ita perverso modo ducantur ut citius frivolas res, vanas, inutiles, et, ut uno complectar verbo, malas persequantur arctis- simeque teneant quam veram solidamque virtutem per quam unam proxime ad deos accedimus et, si fas dictu est, dii efficimur.'

Partly with nature herself, who grudgingly distributes this divine gift: Ask the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the blind to see, the crippled to run swiftly! No, we must not ask for those things which nature has not granted of her own will. Thus we see many-rather the majority-who are lovers of crime, dishonesty and wickedness, and enemies of the honestum, not because the vices are good but because they themselves are of a depraved nature.98 Who will doubt, Sacco concludes in his indictment of harsh, malevolent nature, 'that she has treated us badly, not as a mother, but-if one may so speak-as a stepmother?'99 The other part of the blame lies with man's innate attraction towards vice, that is, pleasure, put there by stepmother nature. Little children love to eat, play and enjoy themselves-sure signs of incipient vice-and loathe punish- ments meant to effect virtue. Nature chastises man by sending him ship- wreck, drought, flood, fire, plague and war-all very frequently. She fights him like a ruthless enemy with intemperate weather, dangerous animals and poisonous serpents. Sacco begs nature to mend her ways either by diminishing the number of vices so that a love of virtue may enter the human breast, or by mitigating the punishments inflicted on mankind for their vices. 100 Critics have accused Valla's Stoic of presenting a gloomy, distorted 'defence' that little resembles genuine Stoic teaching. In particular Sacco omitted divine providence, that most 'Christian' doctrine of Stoicism frequently resorted to by Church Fathers, and preferred the conflict of natura against man and virtue to the more usual Stoic one of fortuna against man and virtue.101 However, the structure of the speech together with the apparent faults were, I believe, carefully planned. Although the oration is neither 'true' as an objective analysis of Stoic moral philosophy, nor as a reflection of Sacco's sunt prediti.

It is a mixture of Stoic and Cynic elements forming 'un pessimismo estre- mista e paradossale', p. 131. Di Napoli thinks the speech expresses views similar to Bruni's, the Stoic spokesman in the first version, pp. 20I--2. It is an extreme form of Cynicism 'al di la di Zenone e di Crisippo, di Seneca e dello stesso Epitteto', p. 21 i1. For Trinkaus, Valla has Catone 'present the case for Stoicism in a way no Stoic would recognise', I, 107. Trinkaus, however, has found paral- lels with Sacco's speech in contemporary literature, specifying 'Petrarchan Neo-Stoic- ism', such as the De remediis. He has also pointed to the omission of providence, and the stress on natura, I, p. 109. For Fois, Valla's anti-Stoicism 'non ha di mira l'ascetismo medievale, particolarmente monastico', p. 140, a statement he himself modifies by allow- ing that Valla might have had in mind some variations of De contemptu mundi literature and some passages of Salutati, p. 141. Both Fois and Trinkaus speak of contradictions in Sacco's speech, without relating these to Valla's declared oratorical strategy.</page><page sequence="22">VALLA, LACTANTIUS AND SCEPTICISM 97 own views, it is true as a serious parody of contemporary trends. It caricatures those 'depraved spirits' and 'learned men' of the Proem, who pay homage to pagan ethics, especially when tinged with Stoic dye-people whose views Valla wants us to see as illogical in themselves, unfaithful to the Roman Stoicism they purport to imitate and, worst of all, incompatible with Christianity. Thus the Christian da Rho comments that while Vegio has dissembled, Catone Sacco, 'whose oration seems to come closer to the truth, has spoken without doubt in earnest and did not introduce the argument in jest'.102 Indeed, unless Sacco's speech is taken seriously in some sense, the whole dispute, aimed at refuting the Stoic moral values it proclaims, becomes pointless. A few examples, hitherto unnoticed, may help to document the 'truth' of Catone's speech. His reference to himself and his few companions 'swimming away' to the harbour of salvation, and his feigned compassion for the 'ignorant crowd' unable to do so recall what Coluccio Salutati says on the opening of Seneca's first letter to Lucilius. By those who waste their life doing something else, aliud, Salutati declares that Seneca means the vast majority of mankind who disregard wisdom and the honestum of Stoic philosophy, being sunk in the moral degradation of their passions and vices. Indeed, one must rejoice that from such a public and universal shipwreck very very few have swum off. Whether this is so because nature envied man from the very start or whether reason willed thus, even a purer antiquity admitted few to the blessed life. Thus speaks Truth: 'Many are called, few are chosen.'103 By quoting Scripture Salutati suggests that Christ himself supports his own dark view of the almost universal depravity of man and of the spitefulness of nature-the themes of Sacco's speech. From the shipwreck only Salutati's predecessor, Petrarch, and Francesco Nelli, the addressee, are seen to be making it safely to port !104 In De seculo et religione Salutati seeks to dissuade a friend from leaving the religious life. By building up an emotional revulsion for the horrors and dangers of the secular world, Salutati hopes his reader will hold fast to the religious state, the surest way to eternal life. Although follow- ing a well-established genre, De contemptu mundi, Salutati's treatise reveals how perilously close this genre skirted to a Manichean vision of creation locked in combat between good and evil.105 He depicts the world as 'the filthiest sewer 102 'Cato autem, cuius oratio propius ad veritatem accedere videtur, haud dubie serio locutus est nec iocandi causa disputationem introduxit.'

See ch. 5 of my Ph.D. thesis. 104 Ibid., p. 244.

PANIZZA of sordid deeds, the threshing-floor of tribulations, the shipwreck of virtue, the snare of souls, the bearer of death, the hell of the living, and a collection of the perishable.'106 As 'the fighting-ground of the devil' the world is especially deceptive, for whatever one finds 'pleasing to the eyes, melodious to the ears, sweet-smelling, sweet-tasting and enjoyable to touch' is nothing but 'bait stuck on hooks'.107 Salutati finds particular fault with the vileness of our bodies and their disgusting natural functions.108 To add to this litany of woe, sickness lies in wait to destroy us, forces of nature such as floods, fires and earthquakes come to plague us, wild beasts and poisonous reptiles beset us.109 At one and the same time, our God and excellent creator, Salutati asserts, has provided a variety of delights in the world around us and has created our bodies with senses seeking enjoyment. But God, nature and pleasure become inextricably confused with diabolic sadism as Salutati warns: 'Wherever you may turn, the world menaces, the devil plots, the flesh caresses, so that follow- ing the creatures, you forget the creator to your perpetual damnation."10 Petrarch is also given to lamentations over man's fragility in a hostile world in the introductory letter to his most famous moral writing, De remediis utriusquefortunae, modelled on Seneca's apocryphal De remediis.111 Especially inimical towards man, nature assails him with storms, fires, earthquakes and floods. Man is engaged in unremitting conflict equally with his fellows, and, most trying of all, with his own turbulent emotions. Reason's domination of the four Stoic irrational perturbationes-joy, hope, sadness and fear-can be achieved only by a few. Since virtue too means controlling the passions, only a few will succeed in being virtuous. Francesco Cardinal Zabarella, a distinguished jurist in Civil and Canon Law at the University of Padua from I390 to I4II, opposes voluptas (or pleasure derived from the senses), to felicitas (or happiness the rational soul achieves only in the next life), in his Defelicitate of around 1400.112 The two are mutually exclusive. An unlettered peasant could refute Epicurus, insult- ingly called 'a woman, indeed a man even weaker than silly old women template for the genre is Innocent III's De miseria humane conditionis, crit. ed. by M. Maccarrone, Lugano 1955, compiled 1195 and widely diffused in the 14th and especially the I5th centuries: Maccarrone lists over 160 I5th-century MSS. De contemptu mundi is another name for the same treatise, which was meant to be followed by a companion piece on the dignity of man. Trinkaus, In Our Image, i, pp. 179-97, sketches the history of both sides of the misery/dignity of man litera- ture from Church Fathers to Petrarch, Salutati, and Valla. 106 'sentina turpitudinum,... area tribula- tionum,... naufragium virtutum,... laqueus animarum, parens mortis, infernus viventium, et aggregatio caducorum.'

See Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, Book IV, and Seneca, De providentia and De tranquillitate animi. Trinkaus-supra, n. Ioi-links Sacco's speech with dialogues on the wretchedness of man in the body of De remediis, but does not discuss the Introductory letter. 112 De felicitate libri tres, Padua 1655; G. Zonta, F. Zabarella, Padua 1915.</page><page sequence="24">VALLA, LACTANTIUS AND SCEPTICISM 99 themselves'.113 Zabarella believes that pleasure derived from bodily senses is 'not only not good but also evil, harmful to man and loathsome to God'. Indeed, 'no enemy force is to be dreaded more or is more worthy of hate'.114 But it should not be forgotten that this opposition of pleasure to reason and virtue-highlighted in Sacco's speech- is characteristic of Roman Stoicism, especially of Seneca.115 Furthermore, the alliance of St. Jerome and Seneca in the former's invective against sex and matrimony, Adversus Jovinianum, led in later centuries to a fusion of the ascetical writings of the Church Fathers and the moral writings of the philosopher.116 Extreme denunciations of pleasure embodied insinuations about the senses, the body and nature herself being in some way evil. Pervading this contemporary literature, then, is the conflict of natura against man and virtue that dominates Catone Sacco's speech. (Such litera- ture also abounds with struggles between fortuna and man: a contest dealt with in Book II of De ... bono.) Valla chooses natura rather than fortuna because he can thus more clearly oppose this view of depraved nature to the Stoic doctrine of divine providence and the goodness of creation (using the Stoics' sword against them); and also because he can in this way turn Stoics into their hated opponents, the Epicureans, as he promised in the Proem. The 'heresy' of the Stoics for the Christian is also revealed, for in a passage that must have inspired Valla, Lactantius objects to the Stoic understanding of natura as an impersonal force: apart from divine power and providence, natura is nothing.7' Antonio da Rho reiterates the passage almost word for word when he accuses contemporary Christians of insulting God when they admire Stoic moral philosophy in ways exemplified by Catone Sacco's oration: Why have you preferred to call nature rather than God the procreator of things? . . . Why have you always had nature herself in view rather than Jesus Christ himself? ... So let not nature which you have expounded, and which is nothing, but let God himself, the creator of nature, whom you have insulted, make an answer to me.118 113 'ille [Epicurus] mulier, imo et ipsis mulierculis fragilior.'

II, xiv, 44, where unless Epicurus is refuted, 'omnis virtus, omne decus, omnis vera laus de- serenda est.' The conflict between virtus and voluptas is judged the supreme question in ethics. Seneca's views are even stronger; see esp. De vita beata, where pleasure is seen as madness as well as vice (xii, 2); and as weakening the fibres of the mind (v, 5). They may in no way be joined, for voluptas will in- evitably corrupt virtus (xv, 1-4). 116 See P.

PANIZZA And Valla overwhelms his Stoicizing Christians with quotations and para- phrases from St. Paul: the sword of the word of God routing the enemy, as Valla also promised in the Proem.119 Lactantius smiles most upon Stoic divine providence, a cornerstone of his own defence of Christianity and an excellent doctrine with which to set Stoics against the materialist Epicureans who deny intelligent order in the universe. Like Valla, he also derides Stoic ethics. Lactantius's Stoic theology in Divinae institutiones and De opificio Dei is based almost entirely on the account of its spokesman Balbus in Cicero's De natura deorum.120 The Stoics, Lactantius asserts, grasped better than any other philosophers that the universe has order which is no product of chance; and they taught that it 'could neither have been made without divine intelligence nor continue to exist unless it were governed by the highest intelligence'. Man was made upright that he might contem- plate the heavens and in so doing infer 'from the very magnitude of the objects, from their motion, arrangement, constancy, usefulness, beauty and harmony, that there is some providence'.121 All creation from the vast heavens to the minutest organ of the body manifests a beneficent purpose at work. The Stoics are inconsistent themselves, Lactantius notes; Valla implies that his contemporaries, supposed Christians, are even more inconsistent by borrowing from Stoic ethics rather than sticking to its theology. Vegio congratulates Sacco for betraying the Stoic cause so well, and lays bare a series of contradictions. By bewailing the depravity of mankind which prefers pleasures to harsh virtue, what is Sacco proving but the naturalness of pleasure and the unnaturalness of virtue practised for its own sake? If so few human beings attain the wisdom and virtue needed for Stoic happiness- the Stoics themselves question whether their perfect beatus sapiens ever existed- what does this demonstrate but the impossibility of the honestum as the ultimate good for man? If the majority of mankind actually shuns the honestum, how can its pursuit be the same as following nature, as the Stoics claim? If nature is to blame for a preponderance of vices, and for man being so wayward as a consequence, why not excuse the human race?122 Vegio, like Lactantius and Augustine, realizes that the Stoics who see goodness and purpose in nature blatantly contradict themselves by depriving man of his emotions. They hurl accusations at her, 'as if she could be reformed . . . as in the case of perturba- tions of our soul or our feelings which they wish to tear out from us by the roots'.123 The Stoics claim that this removal of emotional disturbance is necessary for bringing about that inner tranquillity needed for virtue, but 'I call by no other name than mad,' retorts Lactantius, 'those who uproot the 119 III, viii, 1-2.

Manly Seneca himself maintains, Vegio loftily comments, that 'the gods themselves neither wish nor are able to harm man'. Seneca judges that 'those therefore are mad and ignorant of truth who lay to the gods' charge the cruelty of the sea, excessive rains, and the stubbornness of the winter'. They should under- stand that 'none of the phenomena which harm or help us are planned per- sonally for us' for 'they have their own laws, by which the divine plan operates'.128 Building up to the transformation of Stoic and Epicurean into each other, Vegio accurately remarks that Seneca took so many ideas from Epicurus that it sometimes looks as if he had turned into an Epicurean, or Epicurus into a Stoic.129 Closer to the dispute at hand, Vegio promises to reconcile himseh and Sacco just as Micio the indulgent brother of Terence's Adelphi did with the mean and stingy Demea. The brothers, Vegio comments, can be likened to an Epicurean and Stoic respectively. The suggestion he and Sacco will reverse roles like the brothers of the play is reinforced when Vegio observes shortly after that he will make Sacco (Demea) turn into a Micio (i.e. Epicurean).30O The key to Sacco's transformation, however, rests yet again with the ever- present Lactantius. Vegio the 'Epicurean' spokesman-actually the Christian Academic orator-judges nature and her works holy and praiseworthy. The design of the body alone proves this, states Vegio, 'as Lactantius a sharp and 124 'nihil aliud dixerim quam insanos ... qui evulsis adfectibus quibus omnis constat humanitas, ad immobilem stuporem mentis perducere volunt, dum student animum pertur- bationibus liberare et, ut ipsi dicunt, quietum tranquillumque reddere.'

PANIZZA fluent man plainly demonstrates in his book, De opificio Dei'.131 By approving this little treatise which not only expounds Stoic divine providence but also bitterly attacks the Epicureans, Vegio turns the Epicurean sword against himself from the very start. He also points to the true identity of Sacco, for Lactantius's main accusation against the Epicureans is that they 'find fault with the works of nature in order to show that the world was neither set up nor ruled by providence'. Furthermore, they complain that man is born ... thrust forth and driven out naked and helpless as if from a ship- wreck into the miseries of this life, that he can neither move himself from the place where he was brought forth, nor search for milk as his nourish- ment, nor bear the harshness of the weather. And so, they complain, nature is not the mother of the human race, but a stepmother who has conducted herself with such liberality with dumb animals, but has brought forth man so needy and weak and lacking all resources, indeed, he can do nothing else than forebode his condition of weakness by cries and lamentations.132 [Italics mine] Sacco, of course, similarly bewailed man's wretchedness and the hostility of nature, even calling her not a mother but a stepmother.l33 Rightly, Valla implies, such Stoics can hardly be allowed to praise providence; and contem- porary admirers of Stoicism are exposed as detested Epicureans. Vegio's defence of providence as an 'Epicurean' should not be seen as a lapse of logic by Valla. His alignment of the (normally Stoic) praise of nature and providence with the (normally Epicurean) praise of the senses and their pleasures results in a resolution of inconsistencies besetting each school. Valla is saying that if nature is good-and it must be if created and ruled by God- then man's body, his senses, and pleasure must be good as well. Neither Stoics nor Epicureans, intransigently opposed to one another, could arrive at such a resolution; but by Academic argument the truth emerges. Two points are worth keeping in mind about Vegio's eulogy of voluptas, in the play- ful and licentious manner promised in the Proem. First, as pleasure in itself is never evil, Valla undertakes to defend it precisely at its most shocking. Secondly, pleasure is twofold: that so fulsomely praised in Book I must give way to heavenly pleasure promised in the Scriptures and praised in Book III. Valla is ascetic, but his renunciation is only for the sake of something better. In his praise of the first pleasure, Vegio frequently sustains theses contrary to contemporary ascetic literature of the Seneca/Jerome brand. He defends goods of the body and offortuna, which the Stoics scorn, opposing such a view 131 'quemadmodum Lactantius, vir acri et facundo ingenio, manifestissime ostendit in eo libro . . . De opificio.' I, x, I. 132 'qui naturae opera reprehendunt, ut ostendant nulla providentia instructum esse ac regi mundum.' De op., 2, 1o, from crit. ed. of S.

For Jerome virginity was better and more natural than marriage; to Vegio, 'courtesans and harlots are more deserving from the human race than pious chaste virgins leading a cloistered life'.139 Vegio's declamatio, in which he takes on the additional persona of a Vestal condemned at a tender age to that fate worse than death, enforced virginity, counterpoises Salutati's Declamatio Lucretiae and Jerome's virgins of antiquity who prefer death to a loss of chastity.140 Vegio finally exhorts us not to put aside the certain pleasures of this life for the uncertain promises of a future one: For as long as possible-and longer, if it were possible-let us not allow ourselves to lose, therefore, these bodily goods which are sure and which can never be recovered in another life. As much as we can then-and we can a great deal--let us serve with the greatest kindness our eyes, our ears, our palate, our nostrils, our hands, our feet, and other bodily members, which I hope you would do even without our exhortation.141 134 I, xvi; see also Seneca, De providentia, IV, Io, where bad fortune is seen as better than good for our moral health.

Is Valla seriously recommending us to grasp what we can in this life? Vegio, speaking 'in the manner of the ancients' for whom life after death was unsure, establishes that for them the most natural way of life is one gratefully accepting bodily pleasures and finding Stoic renunciation nonsensical. His oration is none the less an example of Socratic irony. Once more Lactantius offers the key. In Divinae institutiones he is more hostile to the Epicureans than to any other sect. Because the Epicurean deities take no notice of what men do, neither punishing them nor rewarding them after death-as there is no future state-this sect subverts all social order. 'If any pirate chief or leader of robbers were exhorting his men to acts of violence, what other language could he employ than to say what Epicurus says?' asks Lactantius.142 Lactantius contemptuously draws the consequences of Epicurean denial of a caring God and of immortality with unquestionable irony: For if the soul is doomed to perish, let us eagerly pursue riches, that we may be able to enjoy all kinds of indulgence; and if these are wanting to us, let us take them away from those who have them by stealth, by stratagem, or by force, especially if there is no God who regards the actions of men ... let us live in the indulgence of pleasures in every possible way; for in a short time, we shall not exist at all. Therefore let us suffer no day, in short, no moment of time, to pass away from us without pleasure; lest, since we ourselves are doomed to perish, the life we are living should itself also perish. 43 The Epicureans may be right about pleasure being the natural goal of man's activities, but without life after death-for which no pagan philosophy can offer assurance-there is no motivation for the performance of stern virtue, Lactantius indicates.144 Conflict between the two schools is resolved at the end of Book II, after Vegio has demolished the Stoic contention that the virtues are practised for their own sake.145 In the 'harsh, vehement, and aggressive' mode prescribed in the Proem,146 he argues that the motivation was always something useful, advantageous, pleasant, or even expedient: the utile. Vaunted examples of Stoic virtue from Roman history are exposed as fundamentally base, self- seeking, and hypocritical. Valla has taken his cue from Lactantius's account of the visit of Carneades to Rome. The Romans loved not justice, but their palato, naribus, manibus pedibus ceterisque membris benignissime obsequamur, quod vos spero etiam sine nostra exhortatione facietis.' II, xxxi, 7. 142 'archipirata quispiam vel latronum ductor si suos ad grassandum cohortetur, quo alio sermone uti potest quam ut eadem dicat quae dicit Epicurus? 3, 17, 41.

Vegio at last reveals his kinship with Carneades; he argues 'in utramque partem', but also has preferences.148 'Not very far from my own opinion is Carneades the Academic who.., .would speak now in favour of the useful, now in favour of the virtuous,' Vegio admits. Because [Carneades] was bound by the Academic code, he did not reveal his own opinion but spoke for either side (pro utraque parte) and against either side (contra utramque). However, if he had been able to proclaim which side was the truer, like other people, I hardly doubt that he would have approved the side of the useful. For his wit was aflame against the Stoics, whom he persecuted with the greatest hostility.149 Vegio is not simply against the honestum and for pleasure; he is for and against both, favouring pleasure but not dismissing virtue: Carneades's exact solution, according to Cicero.15so As Vegio puts it: 'We say, therefore, that the honestum bears the same relation to virtues as a genus to species, virtues which are directed to the ultimate goal of usefulness.'"51 In other words, virtues are performed not for the sake of moral righteousness, that is for their own sake, but for some advantage or pleasure. Like Carneades, Vegio points to the truth which still, however, lies hidden in accordance with the Academic doctrine that nothing can be fully understood by human reason.152 Antonio da Rho qualifies and expands these conclusions. Unconvinced that Vegio really believes what he says, da Rho suspects he has spoken 'not in earnest but in jest, as is your custom, in the Socratic manner which the Greeks call irona.'153 Vegio is Socratic because he has spoken against his Christian beliefs, not in pronouncing pleasure as man's end, but in saying that the soul dies with the body, that earthly pleasures are all, and that we can dispense with moral considerations to attain them. He has concealed his own opinion and granted greater weight to the opposite side. Da Rho repeats 147 Supra, p. 88. St. Augustine also attacks Stoic Roman heroes Cato and Lucretia by attributing to them base motives. City of God, I, xix, xxiii. Valla would know more recent historical compilations that glorified Roman heroes and heroines, like Petrarch's Rerum Memorandarum Liber, adapted from Valerius Maximus, and collections of Vite and De viris/mulieribus illustribus. See Trinkaus, i, pp. I19-20. Vegio says that utilitas and voluptas are the same, I, xiv, I. 148 Supra, pp. 81, 82, 88. 149 'Nec multum abfuit ab opinione mea academicus ille Carneades qui ... pro utili et honesto utrimque dicebat; hic quia academi- cus lege tenebatur ne suam aperiret senten- 8 tiam sed pro utraque parte et contra utramque diceret.

PANIZZA several times that Vegio was dissembling, the better to argue contra;154 and he himself completes the process of eliciting the truth, correcting errors and dis- tortions. He argues as a Christian with philosophers firstly on their own terms, and secondly with the irrefutable authority of divine revelation. On some issues Valla takes us through five stages of an argument: one for Sacco, two for Vegio and two for da Rho, each resolution coming closer to the final truth of Scripture as Valla interprets it. Echoing Vegio's admission that he was arguing pro and contra both virtue and pleasure, Antonio da Rho declares, breaking down still more the false opposition, that both are to be approved. At the same time 'they are to be disapproved of because they are to be understood otherwise than your reason- ings intended'.155 Paraphrasing St. Paul, he reminds admirers of Stoic virtue that 'those who have lacked faith, hope and charity have not had any virtues'.156 Without charity, 'the mistress of all the virtues, even if a man distributes all his goods among the poor, and gives his body over to be burned, it profits him nothing'." 5 The words well suit Diogenes, that model of Stoic poverty, and Seneca himself, 'the prince of the Stoics', who 'laid down more precepts about poverty than Diogenes ever did',158 as well as those mythical Stoic sages who supposedly maintained their imperturbability, tranquillitas, while roasting inside the bronze bull of Phalaris. The Stoics were right to see the difficulty of virtue, since Paul testifies that to struggle with vice is torment and death, but wrong to imagine that the conflict itself was the motivation.159 Valla paraphrases several New Testament quotations: 'Nothing is done rightly without pleasure'-to contradict the Stoics-'and neither does that person gain any merit who fights in the army of God patiently and not also gladly.'160 The Epicureans are closer to the Christian good because pleasure, voluptas, is the same as delight or happiness, beatitudo, enjoyed in Paradise. One cannot hold, therefore, that the former is shameful and the latter praiseworthy with- out bringing down on one's head the contradictions Valla has been tirelessly revealing.161 Since charity, love of God and one's neighbour, is alone the source of Christian virtuous actions, and since charity is twofold-realized imperfectly in this life as fortitude and perfectly as joy and blessedness in Paradise-the grand resolution of arguing contra is the actual fusion of virtue and pleasure through the fire of divine charity. 154 'Nisi simulate scirem locutum, possem te reprehendere quod contra tuam causam et dixeris et feceris!'. ... 'simulate locutus es'. ... 'tu ... simulator quidam atque iron fuisti et magis Socrates quam Epicurus.'

III, viii, 2. 158 'stoicorum nostrorum princeps Seneca plura de paupertate precepit quam Diogenes precepisset.' Catching Seneca unable to practice what he preaches, Valla quotes Juvenal, Suetonius, and Tacitus on Seneca's great wealth. III, viii, 7. Juvenal, Sat.

Oratorical scepticism, in the hands of the good Christian, is the means of reform. Valla is Carneades, end- lessly refuting the errors that resulted from a false synthesis between Stoic and Christian ethics. Valla is Socrates, pretending that his adversaries are ig- norant of Lactantius, Augustine, Jerome and the Scriptures when De ... bono would lose meaning if these authors were unknown. Valla's importance for later reconciliations of virtue and pleasure, and for later formulations of Academic techniques has been only partially investigated. Perhaps in De ... bono he played the dissembling role of Socrates just a little too successfully. University of Kent at Canterbury 'Huic verbo omnes . . . duas res subiciunt, laetitiam in animo, commotionem suavem iucunditatis in corpore ... voluptas ... vitiosa res ut Stoici putant.' Nevertheless, after giving the Epicurean view of ethics and the final good, Cicero argues against it, and up- holds the Stoic view. Valla's De ... bono could be read as a contrary treatise to Definibus, not merely an imitation as some critics suggest: see Mancini, p. 59, and Trinkaus, i, p. 114. In Christian literature, see Thomas Aquinas, Summa, I-IIae, where on the authorities of Boethius and Aristotle, Aquinas denies that voluptas can have any part of beatitudo: 'neque voluptas corporalis est ipsa beatitudo, nec est per se accidens beatitudinis.'
