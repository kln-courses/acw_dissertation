<plain_text><page sequence="1">commemorated here. The design of the conference programme, reprinted as an appendix, was well suited to book format and has been followed exactly, with the addition of one further contribution (Bet- tina Schmidt, 'Musikpflege am Zerbster Hof um die Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts'). The abstracts repro- duced at the end of each essay (in German for the English essays, and vice versa) help make the outline of the proceedings more easily accessible. The contents, although presented in a single sequence, fall into two broad sections. Context- especially the Zerbst court environment-is par- ticularly the concern of the first group of essays, with consideration of the liturgical tradition pre- dominating. For example, in the concluding essay of this section, Nigel Springthorpe examines the Passion tradition in Zerbst; his wide-ranging survey is nicely complemented by Mary Terey- Smith's account, in the following essay, of the chorale items in Fasch's Passio Jesu Christi, a setting of Brockes's text (comparing it with Handel's and noting the 'basic conceptual disparity' between them). The remaining essays in the second group continue to place more direct emphasis on Fasch's music: its style, structure and texture, with a vari- ety of analytical approaches to the vocal and instrumental works, while Konstanze Musketa provides in the penultimate essay a study of 'Johann Friedrich Fasch's letzte Lebensjahre'. An intriguing item in the first, contextual section of the proceedings is Daniel G. Geldenhuys's in- vestigation of 'Johann Friedrich and Catharina-a Russian-French and German Relationship', with special reference to Fasch's instrumental music. (Geldenhuys reminds us that Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst was 'later known under the byname Catherine II the Great'.) Gen- erally, it is not only Fasch and Zerbst that are illuminated by the scholarship in this book, although these obviously are the main concerns. Among a range of issues covered, different con- tributors consider the comparative status of Kapell- meisters (Michael Saffle); German church and court history (as in Hans-Georg Hofmann's essay on the 'pre-Fasch era' in Zerbst); Telemann recep- tion (Ute Poetzsch examines the evidence for Telemann's links with Fasch and with Zerbst); quartet scoring (Steven Zohn: 'When is a Quartet not a Quartet? Relationships between Scoring and Genre in the German Quadro, ca. 1725-40', another widely focused survey, complemented by the following essay, in which Sandra Mangsen examines in detail the question of 'Soloists and Accompanists in Six Quartets by Johann Friedrich Fasch'); and aspects of text-setting, for example in Brian Clark's essay 'When brevis just isn't short enough: Fasch's Re-Workings of Mass Settings for the Zerbst Schlosskirche'. Fasch's statement, quoted by Clark, that 'during Advent of last year ... I was given to understand that the music was taking too long' could stand as a motto for eighteenth-century attitudes. The most effectively presented essays in this collection are those that do not make excessive claims for the importance of their subject. As an instance of the latter attitude, Geldenhuys's asser- tion that Catherine the Great's youthful stay in Zerbst, where the musical environment repres- ented 'cross[-]cultivation between cultures', 'most probably' enabled Fasch to plant a seed which later 'assisted one of the most powerful rulers of her time to lead one of the then largest countries of the universe and its people to develop into a world power', and that 'through music performed at the court of Zerbst . . . political consequences were drawn whereby a new and foreign culture . . . enriched an old and established cultural legacy, thereby opening up new frontiers for millions of people' does not ring entirely convincingly. The minor flaws scattered through the volume (misprints occur occasionally in music examples; in the text these tend to arise particularly in the contributions in English-'zealousy' (p. 21) and 'publically' (p. 31) noticeably obtrude, while 'cru- cifiction' (p. 127) is unfortunate) do not seriously affect the favourable overall impression: the book is well produced, and is indexed and provided with an up-to-date bibliography. Fasch emerges as a gifted Kapellmeister and composer of attractive music in a variety of genres (better though, in view of the opinions expressed by several of the scholars here, not to fall into the temptation of labelling its freshness of style and structural approach as 'forward-looking'). SUSAN WOLLENBERG Mozart: Piano Concertos Jos. 20 and 21. By David Grayson. pp. xii + 143. 'Cambridge Music Handbooks'. (Cambridge University Press, 1998. ISBN 0-521-48156-2/-48475-8.) It is somewhat surprising that the well-estab- lished and generally excellent Cambridge Music Handbooks series has only now included a volume on Mozart's piano concertos. Mozart's instrumen- tal music is well represented in the series as a whole, with volumes on the Clarinet Concerto, the 'Haydn' Quartets and the 'Jupiter' Symphony (by Colin Lawson, John Irving and Elaine Sisman respectively), as is the concerto genre in general. David Grayson's lucid and perceptive contribution 99</page><page sequence="2">on two of Mozart's most popular and frequently performed piano concertos, No. 20 in D minor K.466 and No. 21 in C major K.467, thus fills an important gap. Grayson's study focuses on the two most con- tentious scholarly issues surrounding Mozart's piano concertos: form and performance practice. In the introduction he discusses Mozart's early performances of K.466 and 467 in 1785 and pre- valent critical metaphors for solo/orchestra inter- action, topics that lead smoothly to a consideration of general understandings of first-movement form. In Chapter 1, 'Twentieth-Century Theories of Mozart's Concerto Form', Grayson summarizes three approaches, those of Donald Tovey, Charles Rosen and Daniel Leeson/Robert Levin. Accord- ing to Grayson, Tovey's and Rosen's accounts, insightful if not systematic, point to the need for a 'detailed, even statistical, knowledge of the con- ventions of the Classical concerto' (p. 19). To this end, Grayson turns to the Leeson-Levin model, which divides Mozart's first-movement concerto form into the following seven sections (combining both sonata and ritornello designations): opening ritornello; solo exposition; middle ritornello; devel- opment; recapitulation; ritornello to cadenza; final ritornello. Although the critical and analytical credentials of these three interpretations are well established, I wonder whether Grayson might not have widened his net somewhat, considering other approaches in more detail. Karol Berger's recent work on Mozart's first-movement concerto form, informed by Heinrich Christoph Koch's concepts of periodic structure and punctuation, springs to mind, as it also allows for a 'rapprochement between the "conformational" and "generative" perspectives' valued by Grayson (p. 21). In Chapters 3, 4 and 5, Grayson analyses the first, second and third movements of K.466 and 467. He provides admirably clear formal descrip- tions for each movement, in tables and in prose, linked effectively to quotations of principal them- atic material (although the music examples on page 35 have been strangely misprinted). In addition, he accounts for multiple formal interpretations, a level-headed strategy that pays dividends in an intelligent reading of concerto, sonata and rondo elements in the finale of K.466. Grayson's formal analyses are often intertwined with anthropomorphic descriptions of interaction between the piano and the orchestra. On occasion this approach seems to lead Grayson astray. His eagerness to explain the first movement of K.466, for example, as a protracted confrontation between the piano and the orchestra, in which a 'tragic outcome' results from 'the [initial] solo theme and the aspirations it represented . . . [being] effectively annihilated' by the end of the movement (p. 42), leads to some questionable interpretations. To be sure, it is difficult to hear the juxtaposition of the orchestra's main theme and the piano's 'first' theme at the beginning of the development as anything other than oppositional. The basis of Grayson's subsequent description of the piano's 'anger', 'frustration' and 'exhaustion' (p. 40) in the remainder of the development, however, seems tenuous. In its battle for tonal supremacy with the orchestra, Grayson explains, the piano falls into the 'trap' of accepting the Neapolitan E flat major as a 'safe space', when the key is in fact 'perilously close' to D minor. It is unclear to me that a 'character' in a Mozart concerto is capable, from a motivational or behavioural perspective, of making a mistake, or of 'realizing too late' (loc. cit.) the ramifications of a particular action, in an analogous manner to an operatic character. Thus, Grayson's subsequent evaluation of piano's beha- viour-it '[seeks] escape' with 'a flurry of bravura figuration', gives a 'panicked response to the "crisis"' in abandoning its solo theme and 'mus- ters the courage to charge forward to the tonic resolution' immediately before the recapitulation (p. 40)-seems forced. Furthermore, his remark that the recapitulation begins with the orchestra's first theme rather than the piano's first theme 'not because this choice is normative, but because the orchestra has won that privilege' (loc. cit.) is a little misleading: of the eight Viennese piano concertos in which the piano offers ostensibly 'new' thematic material at its point of entry (K.413, 415, 450, 466, 467, 482, 491, 503), only two (K.413 and 415) restate this material at the opening of the recapitu- lation. Ultimately, I think Grayson overstates the im- portance of the 'opposition' between the orchestra's and the piano's first themes in the first movement of K.466. The two forces conspire to create a smooth transition between the end of the opening ritornello and the beginning of the exposition, thus in my view accentuating co-operation at the outset rather than thematic opposition. The woodwind writing immediately preceding the piano's entry (bars 75-7) derives its stepwise motion of voices and its sonority (two oboes, two bassoons) from the ascending sequences of bars 33-4, 35-6 and 37-8, while the piano presents a figure originating in the flute in bars 34, 36 and 38, accompanied by left- hand thirds that recall violin writing in the same bars. The woodwind and piano, then, cleverly reshape the oboe/bassoon and flute/violin split- theme dialogue from bars 33-8 (albeit without a split theme as such), thus gracefully integrating the 100</page><page sequence="3">piano into the movement. In a similar vein, the chromatic ascents in the run-up to the recapitu- lation (bars 252-4), interpreted by Grayson as the piano '[facing] the inevitable and [dealing] with the consequences' (loc. cit.) could be cast in a more positive, co-operative light, as they prepare the way for the chromatic ascents in the piano and strings in bars 261-7. In spite of doubts about Grayson's interpreta- tions, I question neither the validity of his general approach to anthropomorphic description nor the engaging nature of his prose. This style of writing has a long and venerable tradition in the context of Mozart's piano concertos, and is a very reasonable way of conveying their 'dramatic' intensity. Gray- son's descriptions of K.466 and 467 will encourage readers to think afresh about these familiar con- certos, even if they happen not to agree with the specifics of his interpretations. Grayson's final chapter is a useful, succinct summary of issues relating to performance prac- tice. With keen attention to recent writings, he carefully negotiates contentious problems of impro- vised embellishment, cadenzas and lead-ins, basso continuo performance, pedal pianos and orchestral sizes and seatings. Where necessary, he is sensibly reconciliatory, proposing as a compromise in the col basso debate that the fortepianist establishes an immediate 'presence' within the orchestra but without making a substantial 'sonic impact' (p. 107). Equally, he is wise to recommend con- ventions of improvised embellishment 'not as a straitjacket but as a springboard' for individual performers (p. 101). In sum, Grayson upholds the high scholarly standards of the Cambridge Music Handbooks series, simultaneously offering general readers a solid introduction to the Mozart piano concerto repertory, and K.466 and 467 in particular. All readers will find much to admire in his analyses, especially the clarity of their formal description, and in his discussion of performance practice; the general reader will benefit in particular from his summaries of twentieth-century formal theories. In fact, Grayson's book is well attuned to Mozart's own famous pronouncement about his first three Viennese piano concertos, K.413, 414 and 415: 'There are passages here and there from which the connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction; but these passages are written in such a way that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased'. SIMON P. KEEFE Mozart in Revolt: Strategies of Resistance, Mischief and Deception. By David Schroeder. pp. x + 211. (Yale University Press, New Haven &amp; London, 1999, ?25. ISBN 0-300-07542-1.) The correspondence of the Mozart family is one of the mainstays of biographies of the composer. The early journeys through northern Europe are known primarily through Leopold Mozart's letters to Lorenz Hagenauer in Salzburg, while the three visits to Italy are vividly detailed in letters from Leopold to his wife and daughter back at home. Over recent years, biographers have relied heavily on the correspondence between Mozart and his father during the composer's ill-fated tour through Germany to Paris in 1777-9 for an understanding of their fragmenting relationship. Our knowledge of the extraordinary saga of Mozart's break from the Salzburg court and his establishment in Vienna in 1781 depends almost entirely on the letters to his father. There is little documentary evidence about his marriage to Constanze or the other aspects of his life in Vienna such as his financial hardship, so here again the letters are of vital importance. Music historians have for many years warned against the dangers of taking the letters at face value. There were many occasions on which Mozart deliberately misled his father and other correspondents. David Schroeder goes further in questioning the veracity of this biographical source, by arguing that the letters should be placed within the traditions of eighteenth-century epistolary style. The writings of the Mozart family are vehicles for different types of discourse, each with their own conventions and rhetoric, and should be read within this context. The central and most interesting sections of this book are devoted to Leopold Mozart's letters and his literary ambitions. The basic premiss is that Leopold planned a biography of his son. However, instead of using the correspondence as an aide- memoire for the future book, the letters were them- selves to form an epistolary biography. Leopold therefore wrote his letters with a view to later publication, and planned to incorporate both them and his son's replies into the book. The model he followed was that of the moral education of a son by a father, based on the discourses of the most distinguished German Enlightenment author of his generation, Christian Ftirchtegott Gellert. Leopold intended the centrepiece of this biography to be the correspondence with his son during the latter's journeys of 1777-9. He wrote his letters to inform and educate his son about life, success and how to behave in society. Such an education might of course encounter disagreement and difficulties, 101</page></plain_text>
