<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arheologiceskie otkrytija 1966 goda (Archaeological Discoveries in the Year 1966) - Associated Editors: Academician V.A. Rybakov (Chief Editor), M.A. Karpokovskaja, T.V. Ravdina, D.B. Selov (U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology, Moscow, ?Nauka ? Publishing House, 1967, 352 pp., with several illustrations). In an earlier number of our magazine (EW, XVII, 1967, pp. 127-131) we had occasion to review the most important summaries offered us from the preceding edition (1965) by this new archaeological Annual, which from now on will be issued regularly each year, as promised by the associated editors in the preface to the new volume. It is almost twice as large as the earlier volume; this proves the success this happy editorial initiative has had in the Soviet and international scientific oikumene, a success confirmed also by the indication of a considerable increase in the number of copies printed (as is known, the Soviet editions have the praiseworthy custom of always stating the exact number of copies printed). From the preface we understand that the directors of the great scientific institutes and the chief archaeological expedition have finally realized the urgent need of a periodical supply of continuous and speedy information to the ever-increasing circle of those experts, both in the U.S.S.R. and in other countries, who wish to follow methodically the results of Soviet research. This research covering an immense archaeological field had been hard to get at up to now for the fact that the relevant studies are spread over a vast number of books and magazines (at times even in non-Russian languages), or hidden away in monographs that are difficult to find, at least for us ?Westerners?. Obviously these mo? nographic studies, continually published in endless numbers in the main Republics of the Soviet Union, will always be indispensable for the specialist, but the latter's task will from now on be eased by the annual publication of this new synopsis, intended to register and describe pe? riodically the events and results that have come about in the archaeological activity of that great country. It would indeed be advisable to have the Russian editions followed by translations in the main intern?tional languages, making the information accessible to those who have no working knowledge of the Russian language. The second Annual differs from the first not only in its larger size. While the first collection contained summaries devoted only to the activities and expeditions of the central institute, that is, the Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., the present volume holds information from many other collateral or auto 499</page><page sequence="2">nomous scientific organisms as well: from the Academies of Sciences of most of the confederate Republics, from universities, from various scientific and pedagogical institutions, museums, and so forth. Thus the present collection offers what we might call a more decentralized and more multiform picture of archaeological efforts in the different regions of Soviet Eurasia, even if -? and the editorial board states this with regret ? some scientific Academies are not yet included in this new edition though it seems that they have promised to participate in forthcoming issues. In examining the previous edition of the annual, we already recalled ? in connection with archaeological field-work ? the structural and organizational difference between ?complex ex? peditions ? on the one hand, and expeditions aimed at the archaeological documentation of a single and circumscribed chronological period, for example, the Palaeolithic, the Chalcolithic, the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Middle Ages etc., on the other. While the reports collected in the earlier Annual were conceived and grouped in accordance with this methodological and organiza? tional dichotomy, the present edition no longer arranges the material in rigorously chronological order; this change being due to the fact that the archaeological researches carried out by the local institutes of the particular Republics are almost exclusively of a ? complex ? nature, that is, they are devoted to an organic examination of a given geographical-archaeological area, considered and studied in the totality of the periods of its past, starting with the Stone Age. The order of the contribution is thus based more or less on the administrative and regional division of the Soviet Union and on the geographical location of the objects and complexes found and examined, obviously not ignoring their chronological strati? fication. Thus each section of the book refers to one of the confederate Republics, beginning with the Russian Sov. Fed. Soc. Republic (R.S. F.S.R.), followed by the Republics of the European part of the Confederation (Ukraine, White Russian Federal Republic, Baltic Republics, Moldavian Republic), and then by Kazakhstan and the Republics of Central Asia. The review of the excavations in the territory of the R.S.F.S.R. starts with its northern and northwestern districts, ending with those of the Soviet Far East. We have here, on the whole, a broad exposition and a cross-section of Soviet archaeology, as it appeared at the end of the year 1966; the reports are based on the work and final results of tens of archaeological expeditions at work in hundreds of prehistoric and protohistoric sites, villages, ancient cities, necropolises, fortifications, etc., brought to light from the bowels of a continental mass that extends from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and the ? Roof of the World ?. The archaeology of the U.S.S.R., like its geography, teaches us to think in new mental categories that, though not ? transcendental? in the metaphysical sense of the word, certainly transcend the limits of classical, Winckelmann type, Europacentric archaeology, opening up for us prospects as boundless as the Eurasian steppe itself. Above all, down to the end of the First World War, we possessed only scarce and fragmen? tary ideas of ?Inner Asia?, limited to circum? scribed periods and areas, such as the Bronze Age in Southern Siberia, or the early stages of a metallurgical culture in Turkestan: these were tiny oases in the vast desert of our almost total ignorance; now the many hundreds of archaeological sites, and the tens of prehistoric ? cultures?, discovered and thoroughly studied by what we might call armies of specialists at work, constantly supply us with new elements for a future global vision that will embrace the entire Eurasian continent, matrix of all that we are and possess. We believe that many further editions of this publication will have to contribute to the con? struction of a general picture, and we also think that quite a few of the generalizing theories, already traced tentatively and temporarily by one or the other of the scholars reunited here, will have to be subjected to further examination, for the purpose of controlling or correcting them. This control and correction can only be undertaken in fraternal collaboration with non-Russian ex? cavators and scholars, those at work in the neighbouring zones, in Anatolia, Iran, Afghanistan, the Indian-Pakistan sub-continent, Central Asia, etc. Most of the summaries contained in the volume under examination are excellent, but if we might express some reservations on the matter we should like to note that at times some Soviel scholars do not always pay sufficient attention to a self-evident truth: that is, that the political national framework in which they think and work, the U.S.S.R., is merely a modern creation (the same observation naturally applies to the Czar's empire, when measured by the historical yardstick), while for millennia the immense Eurasian spaces had no frontiers of this kind, and least of all the national frontiers of yesterday and today; so that a dense network of relations and correlations linked many, if not all, of the prehistoric and protohistoric ? cultures ? found in the territory of the present-day U.S.S.R., with the surrounding world. Let us repeat: this seems like a banality at first glance, but anyone who reads certain pages of this Annual (not to mention certain other Soviet monographic publications) often has to deplore 500</page><page sequence="3">the fact that some specialists seem to be pretty unaware of this banal truth. A broader ? opening ? on the part of Soviet archaeology towards trie researches carried out by other nations on the Eurasian continent, and more collaboration with them, also on the level of practical agreements and concrete coordination of the researches, would therefore be highly desirable and definitely pro? fitable for both sides, and above all for science itself. Let us not forget that approximately one hundred and sixty reports are gathered in the present Annual, and that there stand at times more than one author for a single report, that is to say the whole leading group responsible for the relative expeditions and excavations. They are for the most part ? professional ? excavators, technicians and specialists in a given archaeological area or prehistoric period, whose task, at least in the present context, was merely descriptive and phenomenological, and not at all the arranging into vast cultural coordinates the single objects, or complexes of objects, they brought to light and examined. Nevertheless, we find among the authors the names of some scholars internationally known, not only as experts and fortunate techni? cians in excavating, but also as scholars endowed with a broad view and the spirit for historical synthesis. We can only mention a few of these, chosen from those who have dedicated their scientific life to the investigation of the primeval cultures of Asia, while many other achievements, pertaining to the prehistoric archaeology of eastern Europe, the plains of the great Russian rivers, the Caucasus, etc., are beyond the range of interests of our review. Even though the archaeological zones of major interest are located east of the Urals, the border between Europe and Asia, even this border, like all the others, was artificially traced by man in later times, while for example a great Neolithic culture of eastern Europe, that which takes its name from Tripole on the Dnepr, seems to be connected with the Near East, and most likely even with the Chinese culture of painted pottery (Yang-shao culture). The oases of southern Turkmenia played a determining role in this network of Eurasian interconnections, so that we can understand why the explorers' spades have been busy there for many decades. This zone acted as a kind of cultural exchange centre in a north and northeast direction too, towards Sibe? ria; and with the passage to the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages, this cultural current becomes ever more vigorous and thus more documentary. For example, there are the agricultural communities of Afanasevo in southern Siberia, whose potter} shows tangible relationships with those of Susa or Siyalk, as well as with the Anau culture in Central Asia. This civilization is the product of a more or less intimate fusion between cultural elements from the Volga, the Pontic and the Caspian zones. Even the later Andronovo cul? ture can be listed in the present context: it extended from the Urals to Central Asia and the Pamirs. Equally vast in extension was the successive culture of Karasuk; its connexions with Iran and Luristan have been convincingly demon? strated by Soviet and non-Soviet science. These dozens of reports carry us to this boundless world of Central Asia, Siberia and the Russian Far East, offering us themes of specific interest for an orientalistic periodical. In spite of this ? and also in homage to the program of the present journal, which is defined in its very name ? we shall never tire of repeating that Eurasian archaeology is one and indivisible, and that as a result its dichotomous division can only be artificial in nature; at the most, it can only serve practical and organizational purposes, as in the present case, in which we see a subject ? boundless in time and space, and interconnected in many ways ? expounded and arranged on the basis of organizational criteria applied externally, that is, dictated by a modern political-administra? tive system. We shall now point out some of the contribu? tions that refer to Siberia, to the Soviet Far East, to the territory of Kazakhstan and those of Uzbekistan, Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan, and lastly of Kirgizia, confining ourselves to the precise arrangement of the reports in the book before us. We shall limit ourselves to a restricted choice of names and sites, part of them already known to the reader, thanks to the reviews already dedicated, in our magazine, to some more organic Soviet archaeological publications. As already noted in examining the earlier edition of the Annual, two great ? complex ex? peditions ? operate in Siberia, the Sajano-Tuvin skaja Ekspedicija and the Krasnojarskaja Ekspedi? cija, so called from the geographical areas reserved for them. The first, which works in central Tuva, near the Sayan Mountains (eastern Altai), in the area of a large reservoir-dam, continued its work in summer of 1966 in a zone that was very rugged and menaced by a huge flood from the Yenisei River. One squad, studying the Stone Age under the direction of S.N. Astahov, managed to discover for the first time in central Tuva artifacts that can be attributed to the Middle Palaeolithic. Other squads, directed by A.D. Grac, I.U. Sambu and Ju. I. Trifonov, explored the kurgans of this zone; apart from contributing to the elaboration of a more exact relative chronology, these excava? tions revealed for the first time in this area burial 501</page><page sequence="4">grounds containing artifacts belonging to the cul? tural horizon of Karasuk. The expedition also continued the study of the sites of the Scythian epoch, a period that is known to be of extreme importance in the protohistory of Central Asia. These excavations brought to light, especially on the site of Kujlug-Hem, a hitherto unknown type of kurganic tomb belonging to this period; thus it exceptionally enlarged our knowledge of the culture, art, funeral rites and social structure of the peoples that occupied the territory of Tuva about the middle and second half of the 1st cent. B.C. The gold and bronze objects found there merit special attention; they are executed according to the canons of that variant of the Scythian animal style known from the famous site of Pazyryk. Even the remains of the Hunnish-Sarmatian period were thoroughly explored. The squad directed by A.M. MandeTstam managed to explore, in the cemetery of Baj-Dag II, a complicated type of kurganic construction, new for Tuva, which bears certain resemblances to the analogous constructions of Noin-Ula, in Mongolia. The inventory of these kurgans of the Hunnish-Sarmatian period consisted of numerous pottery series as well as of iron, bronze and gold objects. The exploration of the palaeo-Turkic kurgans continued in 1966 too (Ju. I. Trifonov, A.M. Manderstam); they can be attributed to a period (7th-8th cent. A.D.) in which the ethnic outlines of the present Turkic speaking peoples of Central Asia and southern Siberia began to take shape. There is exceptional archaeological and historical-artistic value in the numerous rock engravings, found (by the groups directed by D.V. Makarov and A.A. Formozov) in the Yenisei Valley and the mountainous zones of the Sayan range. The anthropomorphic petroglyphs are worth mentioning: they show ancient Shamanic masks supplied with horns, and other parapher? nalia belonging to the Shaman. The other Siberian expedition, Krasnojarskaja Ekspedicija, also continued in the year 1966 its exploration of the Yenisei Palaeolithic, above all of the site of Kokorevo I, already mentioned in our examination of the preceding annual; this locality has revealed an orderly succession of cultural horizons. The new finds registered in our Annual also seem of great interest, in the light of Eurasian protohistory; this expedition has added greatly to our knowledge of the Karasuk culture (from the name of a locality in the Minusinsk basin), that is, that culture of ? international? dimensions which we mentioned earlier, and which follows in about the 12th cent. B.C. the Andronovo culture. The mogil'niki, numerous and often very large, that can be attributed to this culture, were also investigated in 1966 by many squads: those of Kjurgenner, Ulug-iCjuzjur on the Yenisei (already discussed in our review of the preceding Annual), Malye Kopjony and many others. Among the many names of authors of reports on Siberian excavations, we can only mention (with apologies to the others) M.P. Grjaznov, L.P. Zjablin, Ja. A. Ser and S.S. Sorokin. One cannot omit the new archaeological expeditions in the districts of Omsk and Tomsk, organized in summer of 1966 by the State Univer? sity of Tomsk and the Pedagogical Institute of Omsk. Burial-grounds of various epochs, from the 15th cent. B. C. to the 9th cent. A.D. were examined. As we have already remarked at the start of this brief review, this present edition of the Annual represents for the first time various local universities and scientific institutions which have organized archaeological campaigns, but space for listing them all is lacking. At any rate, we cannot pass over in silence the interesting engrav? ings on rockface discovered by the Siberian section of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in the regions of the Upper Altai. These consist of no less than 200 designs that can be divided into three cycles. Unfortunately only one of these drawings is shown in the text of our Annual (by the way, it would be most desirable if the later issues were less ? miserly ? in including illustra? tions!). The protagonist of these engravings seems to be, apart from the hunter, the Cervus tnaral Ogilb., related to our Cervus elaphus L. In all probability, these painted and engraved animals have a ? hunting magic ? nature. Even the later Siberian ? cultures ? have been considerably enriched by the 1966 archaeological campaigns: above all that horizon which in the same basin of Minusinsk mentioned before ? so rich in archaeological discoveries ? has been given the name of Tagar culture (7th-3rd cent. B.C.): it too has very broad connections, down to southern Russia. To the end of this Tagar period there belongs the rich ? treasure? of almost 200 objects, which has been in the District Museum of Krasnojarsk since 1966; the objects are mostly of bronze and carried out in the zoomorphic style (cf. one of the ? all too rare ? illustrations). Let us list the following, among the other reports worthy of being highlighted: researches on the Mesolithic in the upper area of the Angara River; excavations in the upper part of the valley of the Lena River; Neolithic and Iron Age settlements in the zone of the Amur River. The indefatigable A.P. Okladnikov is represented also in this context, with a substantial account of excavations on the Neolithic site of Voznesenovka, already known as such for some years, but where 502</page><page sequence="5">two different Iron Age cultural horizons have now been identified. The stratigraphic excavations made in this area have allowed us to divide the Neolithic of the lower Amur into more exact chronological periods, and according to Okladnikov, to document the ?cultural originality of the Neolithic populations of the Far East ?. Another well-known archaeologist, K.A. Aki sev, informs us about the recent campaigns ot the Central Kazakhstan Expedition of the Institute of History, Archaeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the federal Republic of Kazakhstan; he supplies us with a thorough des? cription and analysis of numerous mogtVniki and sites that belong to various periods of the Bronze Age. Here too the harvest of petroglyphic representations was exceptionally rich. Soviet Uzbekistan is the subject of the next section of our reports. As reporters we find here some names already familiar to our readers in other contexts, in which some of them have appeared in the columns of our magazine. In fact, SP. Tolstov (along with M.A. Itina and A.V. Vinogradov) brings us up to date on the activity of the Khorezm Expedition of the Ethnographic Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S. S.R., carried out with the use of nine large research groups in various working periods. An enormous amount of territory was examined: apart from the excavations in Chorasmia itself, the work begun earlier on the Syr-Darya and in the desert of the Kyzyl-Kum also continued in this year. Speaking chronologically, the sites and objects studied refer to a time-span extending from the Middle Palaeolithic to the end of the Middle Ages. Since we are dealing here with the annual contin? uation of excavations begun some years ago, for example in the kurganic cemetery of Tuzgyr (Chorasmia) and at Toprak-kala, etc., our Annual supplies us with very little information about these new discoveries in sites already explored; but since we are accustomed by now to the very detailed reports supplied to us periodically by the already famous Trudy horezmskoj arheologo etnograficeskoj ekspedicii series, we must put off all judgements on these new realizations of Cho rasmic archaeology until the next volume appears. We cannot close these brief comments without also mentioning the researches made by the Ferghana Archaeological Expedition of the State Hermitage, in collaboration with the District Museum of Ferghana, in the southeastern part of the Ferghana oblasf, or the work of the joint Central-Asian Expedition of the Hermitage and the State Museum of the Art of the Peoples of the East. The site was Kara-tepe, in the very fertile archaeological zone of Termez. One of the great names of Asiatic archaeology, B. Ja. Staviskij, already known to our readers, informs us about the work (now in its sixth season) in this area. The material from the 1966 excavations has further enriched and deepened our understanding of the art, architecture and history of Kara-tepe, the only great 'Buddhist cultual centre of the Kushan period hitherto found in Central Asia. The excavations in the federal Republic of Tadjikistan, described by two other well-known specialists, B.A. Litvinskij and A.M. Belenickij, concentrated on a great number of sites, among them Adzina-Tepe, a Buddhist monastery of the 7th-8tli cent, and a very imposing architectural complex; the sculptures discovered in the 1966 excavations ? fragments of a gigantic Buddha passed to Nirvana ? are reproduced in two interesting illustrations. There is no need to add that even in the year we are referring to the work of excavating and reconstructing the very famous site of Pjandzikent continued: other large frag? ments of the famous pictorial cycle, one of the most enigmatic in all of Asian art, have been brought to light. Attempts to interpret these mysterious subjects have gone in for decades now, and the new painting fragments have added other problems to those which already existed. The researches of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the federal Republic of Turkmenistan (reporter: O. Berdyev) have been very active; as was to be expected, they were concentrated on the Anau culture, represented by a large number of ? tepes ? in the territory of that republic. The work done in 1966 on another site not unknown to our readers, Altyn-tepe, is summarized by the leader of that expedition him? self, V.M. Masson. This ? proto-urban ? site also appeared in the preceding Annual, but recently there have come to light many new objects, among them the singular zoomorphic seals shown in the book. These new discoveries at Altyn-tepe and in other necropolises of the zone have posed a series of important problems for science, and we can foresee that Masson will examine them more thoroughly in a later publication. V.l. Sarianidi also deals with these excavations at Altyn-tepe and Hapuz-tepe, while K. Kacuris discusses those at El'ken-tepe, in southern Turkmenia, formerly a great urban centre of northern Parthia. The Annual ? and our necessarily brief 'indica? tion of its rich, and occasionally overflowing, contents ? ends with the archaeological researches of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the federal Republic of Kirgizia, a territory also covered with kurgans. Noteworthy among them the huge mogiVnik of Almaluu com? posed of 120 kurgans, 10 of which have been explored till now, and which contain skeletons, gold and bronze jewels, etc. Forty kurgans of 503</page><page sequence="6">the 270 to be found in the mogil'nik of Kyzyl-Zazy have been openend and studied. The populations and respective cultures whose remains are depos? ited in these burial-grounds can be dated to a time-span that goes from the 3rd-2nd cent. B.C. to the 5th-6th cent. A.D.
