"Hellstrom Chronicle."-Since the era of Walt Disney's cut-and- spliced films of animals dancing to music there have been few nature films of note that were not also human films. One could marshall some evidence for a theory that nature films simply don't sell at the box office. Despite the excellent photo- graphy of the old Disney films, they had to be "jazzed up" with unnatural se- quences, staged behavior and anthropomorphic interpretation. Despite these gimics, one of Disney's directors once told me that they lost money on every nature film produced. The new genre was to introduce the animals into a human story. Some good films of this type came from Scandinavia and England. "Pure" nature films are rare at the theaters; perhaps Hans Sielmann's excellent film on the Galapagos was one of the most recent. "Hellstrom Chronicle" lies somewhere between "Born Free" and this last, and some of the photography is by Sielmann. The continuity is provided by "Nils Hellstrom, M.A., Ph.D. " who narrates the film with the theory that the insects shall inherit the earth. The vehicle, although occasionally distracting, can be forgiven, for the photography is marvel- ous. See insects feeding, moving, fighting, reproducing, developing and communi- cating in utterly fantastic sequences of uncontrived behavior. No anthropo- morphism here; insects lend themselves not to human empathy. In its emphasis on the powers of natural selection to mold survival and reproduction as the focus of life, "Hellstrom Chronicle" is the most biological nature film it has ever been my pleasure to see. Don't miss it.-Jack P. Hailman. MISCELLANEOUS 68. Sociology of refereeing. H. Zuckerman and R. Merton. 1971. Physics Today, 24(7): 28-33.-An examination of large series of papers submitted for scientific journal publication finds that eminent scientists publish not only better papers but more papers than "run-of-the-mill scientists." Who would admit himself in the latter classification? "Rank and authority are acquired through performance but, once acquired, tend to be ascribed for an indeterminate time." They find that while submission rates are nearly equal, about 91% of the papers by physicists in the "foremost" institutions were accepted for publication as against 72% from other universities. Interestingly it is noted herein that even in the serious science of physics many practitioners are there only because for them it is the most convenient way of making a living.-Leon Kelso. BOOKS AND MONOGRAPHS (See also 28, 87) 69. Families of Birds. Oliver L. Austin, Jr. 1971. Golden Press, N. Y. 200 pp, paperback. $1.95. (Illustrated by Arthur Singer).-Once in a great while there appears a volume so useful and well done that usual praise would demean rather than acclaim it. Whereas Austin has covered much of this same material in other formats, this survey of fossil and living birds, excellently illustrated in color by Arthur Singer, is surely the most attractive and useful exposition of the subject. There is an Introduction to taxonomy, an explanation of the Faunal Regions of the World, a marvelous color chart of the avian Fossil Record based on Pierce Brodkorb's work, a section on the Origin and Evolution of Birds, and the system- atic accounting of families. Each family is illustrated with typical species, and a general account is given of the distribution, characteristics and habits of its species. There are a few things that might have been given more attention, such as the statement (p. 92) "5 fo 1 species to Eocene of Wyoming", which appears</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 43, No. 1 Recent Literature [73 to be due to a sleepy typesetter. And I object to defining the chordates as "back- boned animals" (p. 10). (Curiously, Subphylum Vertebrata is then designated "vertebrate animals," which cannot be terribly illuminating to the uninitiated.) Unfortunately, the myth that sandgrouse drink by sucking is perpetuated (p. 85). But the occasional slips demand forgiveness. This book is one of a series of small volumes on biology and natural history begun under the editorship of Herbert S. Zim, and continued here under Vera R. Webster. We hope more like the present volume will be forthcoming. If you mniss this little gem for under two bucks you deserve your fate.-Jack P. Hailman. 70. Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World. Leslie Brown and Dean Amadon. 1968. McGraw-Hill, N. Y. Two volumes, 945 pp. $59.50.-As faithful readers of the Recent Literature section are aware, this reviewer is often dubious about the worth of large sumptious volumes, the average value of which seems to depreciate faster than most used automobiles. There are, however, exceptions- and this seems to be one. This is no ordinary collection of. overpriced plates by unknown and insensitive artists, but, rather, a real attempt to provide an authori- tative and at the same time attractive account of the hawks of our planet. Actually by "hawks" one means all the species of the Order Falconiformes, including the new world vultures and condors; osprey; kites, old world vultures, harriers, ac- cipiters, buteos, eagles, and other Accipitridae; the secretary-bird; and the cara- caras and falcons. This project was an immense undertaking, and seems to have come off very well indeed. The first 150 pages or so of the book consist of chapters of textual material oIn various matters. I say "the book" because pages are numbered consecutively throughout the work, and the division into two volumes is merely a convenience of binding, there being no logical break between the two volumes. The book begins by introducing the diversity, classification and possible phylogenetic trends of these raptorial birds, and then proceeds to physical attributes and plumages. The emphasis throughout the early chapters is on the adaptive significance of various structures and habits, and the adaptiveness of differences among species. The evolutionary thinking in general seems quite sound, if unsupported by real evidence. (For instance, while one expects that greater density of photoreceptive cells leads to greater visual acuity, it is not a logical necessity that this be so; someone needs to condition a hawk in a Skinner box, as has been done with pigeons, to find the real resolving power of their visual systems.) A goodly space is devoted to the daily cycle, flight dynamics, and migration of hawks, in general but informative terms. The text then is prepared to delve into foraging methods and thence into the food ecology of predation. These sub- jects lead into territoriality, reproductive displays, nesting, eggs, incubation, and rearing of the young. Again, the text carefully sets the scene for returning to fundamental matters of ecology, the next subjects being breeding success, nro- ductivity, longevity, mortality, and enemies. Finally, the economics and re- creational value of hawks is discussed in the chapter on Hawks and Man. Part II is the real meat of the book, taking the remaining several hundred pages of the first volume and all of the second. It is, basically, a species account of all living hawks; an impressive feat it is. It begins with a general field key for identification of genera, which seems to me to be utterly useless. Who is going to lug such a huge volume around in the field, sorting through all the hawks of the world, merely to find the genus of something he has seen in a specific locality? Almost (not quite) anywhere one goes in the world a better means of field identi- fication for hawks exists. There is, however, also a useful section on synonomy of names (both species and genera), as well as two other useful features: a list of forms treated here as species that are not always considered so in the literature, and a list of subspecies that are sometimes given specific status in the literature. One hopes that lists such as these will become a standard item of monographs on various avian groups. There are, in the species accounts, basically four separate items that one must match up, sometimes (alas) requiring both volumes to be open at once. First, there is the basic text, which gives the usual information about range, description (including separate accounts of the subspecies), voice, general habits, food, and breeding habits. The authors have tried to assemble hard-to-come-by data, such as the weight of the birds. One or a few references end the text, and these must be considered inadequate.</page></plain_text>
