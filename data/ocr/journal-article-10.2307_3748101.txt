<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSIONS r JASPERS' CONCEPT OF TRANSCENDENCE (GOD) IN RECENT LITERATUREI I propose to consider briefly some critical points that have been raised against Jaspers' concept of God as the reality, which can only announce itself, but never become object of thought, because it is impossible to reach the reality which is beyond all phenomenal thought. There remains only on Jaspers' premises the ever to be renewed movement towards the Transcendent, to be disclosed in the reading of the language of the cipher by which Transcen- dence is felt in this world but never made available as an object that can be laid hold of in its actual reality. This is the more significant because the demand for a transcendent supreme reality is justified, as its absolute character would be lost by descent into human thought, by the objectifying effort of which it would be coloured and conditioned. Since the realm of Transcendence is inexhaustible, the human mind at its farthest point of progress in knowledge must still see stretching away before it as its limiting condition, the region of the Unknown-the unfathomable depth of that Being of which any figurative or objectifying effort must be denied so as to keep its transcendent character pure. This is not, as the critics assume, to suspend the Transcendent in the air. It is rather meant to keep the movement towards the Transcendence going, and not to paralyse it into a possessive inactivity. That is why Jaspers developed, on the Kantian basis, his conception of a God not liable to the dangerous distortions of an anthropomorphism which have been prevalent throughout history. It was not merely that he found God to be indescribable in human speech, but also to transcend the utmost power of human thought. For this reason and on account of the failure of words or symbols, in which there is no longer anything corresponding in our imagination, many thinkers adhered to the theory of the negative attributes of God (according to which all affirmative statements about God are false). But that theory was found wanting for it came near emptying belief of all content. Unable to rest content with this purely negative position, other thinkers, starting from the premise that God's image as the fountain of all creation must indwell and therefore be discernible in that creation assumed that we might draw conclusions as to His character at least indirectly, by way of analogy, passing from the finite to the infinite, thus supplementing by an affirmative theology the theology of negation. On the grounds of this theory, resting upon analogical inference, J. B. Lotz, J. Collins, and, on somewhat similar lines, J. N. Hartt and von Rintelen have challenged Jaspers' position in that respect. In fact, it is worth while to reproduce the main argument that has been put forward by Lotz, and following him by Collins, in the adequate English rendering that has been given to it by Collins as follows: "But in seeking to safeguard the uniqueness and absoluteness of the transcendent God, we need not so separate Him from our existence that He Himself is treated as non-existent. .... To be, to exist, and to know are perfections which do not involve any intrinsic defect, and hence they are I Taken from a thesis, entitled "Jaspers Concept of God," submitted for the degree of doctor of Philosophy to the University of South Africa. 255</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY most properly attributed to the transcendent reality in which, as Jaspers admits, there can be no becoming, possibility or imperfection.... Thus the analogical unity of being as studied by metaphysics enables us to speak and speak significantly, though not comprehensively, about the source and end of being."' In considering what is involved in this principle of analogy, we come to see that it justifies, by its method of arguing from effect to cause, "a discursive ascent from the immediately given to the transcendent, even though such an ascent will give only an imperfect understanding of the term of this movement."' In thus advancing into the Transcendence, we are not conquering what belongs to an alien territory, but we are rather reclaiming ground of reality that is by analogy to be identified with ourselves as created in the image of God. The argument, then, to which these considerations are held to lead, is as follows: "The richness of the object of metaphysics is of two sorts: an immanent secondary kind which coincides with categorical being, and the transcendent richness which is primary and supracategorical. Thus concrete things are included within the order of essences or categories, which are present in, and yet surpass, the individual instances embodying a given perfection. And essences for their own part are included under being and its attributes, without exhausting the resources of being itself. The immanent fullness of categorical essences and concrete finite things supposes a primal reality in which the transcendental perfections of being are realized absolutely, and in which the reality of essences and things is also found in an eminent way. Along these lines the Scholastic theory of transcendence provides the metaphysical foundation of the doctrine of analogy as understood from the standpoint of the creature."3 The presupposition which constitutes the cause of inquiry is that according to Lotz,4 analogical knowledge surpasses the realm of the categorical and by doing so establishes, still within the bounds of the rational, the realm of the supracategorically Rational-a realm which in Jaspers' system is totally cancelled out. In addition, the supracategorical would give Transcendence a fullness of essence, thus making possible a concept of God, however incomplete and in suspension. On any other supposition, the act of Transcendence, while without content and therefore empty, could not yield a picture of God and would finally sink to the level of an empty sphere which while all-compre- hensive, yet cannot develop into an object that would stand over against us. In this connection Lotz points to Jaspers' statement to the effect that "though God is, however concealed, yet all-present as the reality,"5 it remains doubtful what in fact reality does seem to assert. In like manner the cipher, though for philosophy the transcendent reality in the world, can only point to a trans- cendent reality that is emptied of any content, whereas in the philosophy of analogy God appears as an independent Real, as infinite spirit, restoring for the human mind a worthy object of worship and adoration. The difference between the two kinds of metaphysics, that of the cipher and that of the analogy, or the stages through which knowledge (of Transcen- J.

"Thus what Lotz calls the explicative or interpretative method of the theory of ciphers is an incomplete process of transcending, reaching only to the immanent depths of the given. It finds its justification and completion only in the metaphysic of analogy, for the analogical method not only completes the transcending process, but also rises by mediate knowledge to a trans- cendent and subsistent reality."2 The standard by which the admissability of the symbol of the cipher is to be judged must also be given attention according to Hartt for, he says, "The notion of Symbol, so important for Jaspers' system, is cheated of its full significance and power by the underlying Kantian epistemological perspective.... But at the end, Jaspers lumps the whole scale together in a blanket denial that any analogy yields positive knowledge of God's nature. "3 Having thus attempted to show in what respects this aspect of Jaspers' system is inadequate Hartt concludes: "For me this remains the most perplexing question of all: does God become positively meaningful even then? Or is he left as Wirklichkeit mysteriously expressing itself through its modes, all of which are 'signs and symbols,' including existence itself. But how are the symbols to be interpreted, unless symbol and reality symbolized are somehow or other positively and simul- taneously embraced, and unless this embracing, this primal apprehension can be brought up out of the vagueness and mistiness of the 'merely intuitive' into conceptual clarity?'"4 It is noteworthy that F. J. von Rintelen5 carried this reasoning still farther, pointing out that our awareness of ultimate Being is intrinsically possessed of cognitive reference to the Transcendent. It is asserted that one has to attribute to Being, be it in its space-time reality or in its spiritual expression as cosmos, a trans-subjective meaning, an essence, an inwardness that in ultimate depth discloses itself to the inwardness of the individual. This interaction is accord- ing to von Rintelen not to be defined as appearance merely. The argument does take into account that Jaspers' difficulty does not lie in a denial of objective Reality, but rather in the fact that it cannot become an object of our thought and therefore not an object of any proof. Von Rintelen furthermore draws the conclusion that in our existential encounter and final act of decision and intellectual appreciation of what is significantly conclusive, the Unconditional is bound to become objectified content at least in so far as we intend one particular thing rather than something else. Thus, when this question of moral action is raised, the appeal is to an act of judgment. Here, again and pre-eminently, though recognizing the existential self's historical situation particular to itself only, one has to assume, so von Rintelen argues, that the i Lotz, Analogie Und Chiffre, pp. 55-6. 2 Collins, e.c.p. 69I. 3 J.

R 257</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY existential self seizes a certain and specific content of truth-claiming objectivity. The entire discussion has but a single point. It aims to show that Transcen- dence as assumed by Jaspers is endangered by the fact that it cannot become an object of thought. It is only through an objective bond which can sustain relations to existential Selves and their activities, it is argued, that Transcen- dence can subsist. But enter upon this road and, according to Jaspers, the time is sure to come when the appropriate object of thought is stripped of all its transcendent character, and by becoming final and self-sufficient, Transcen- dence will be found to be lost for ever. It is the ulterior problem of Jaspers' system to make Transcendence, and not just the ever changing results of the process of thinking about Transcendence, prevail in human experience. Those results, gained in limit-situations, will be saved in Jaspers' system by his theory of communication. In any sense in which objectivity is legitimate boundless communication is of the essence of life. The capacity of existential Selves to enter into communication and thereby generate further meanings in respect of existence and Transcendence more profound and far reaching than those from which they sprang, guarantees to human existence what Jaspers' critics seemed eager to deduce from a concept of Transcendence that, on their view, should be available to categories of human thought. So much for the problem of (fulfilled) Transcendence. Returning to the main subject of our discussion, we must now examine the claim of the supporters of the doctrine of analogy. What, then, shall we say of the justice of the claim of the critics? We do not hesitate to affirm that it does not seem in principle sound-for the process of analogy also lands us in a dilemma, and, indeed, some would maintain that it sets as many problems as it solves. Much as we should like to accept analogical inference it would be a futile guide in questions of the relationship between the finite and the infinite, which differs from the finite not merely in degree. For if we are content to register analogies taken from human life and history, what criterion have we for choosing between the claims of conflicting revelations ? Then, again, if we take the analogies seriously we may fall a victim to our anthropomorphic tendencies, making an image of God in the light and likeness of our own predilections. But, on the other hand, if we stress the otherness of Transcendence as difference in kind, we are back again in the teachings of negative theology. A way out of this impasse is offered by Jaspers' teaching of immanent Transcendence, generated in direct experience of the existential self's ascent to freedom, which gives rise to positive expression, not of the essence of Transcendence, which must remain beyond the reach of knowledge, but of the actions of God in relation to man in their historically determined mode of existence. In fact, it is here that the clue lies to Jaspers' acceptance of the fundamental principles of the Bible. These were disclosed to man at the limit situations in which he found himself, yielding, as a result of the struggle with the conditions of a secular order, that insight which was in boundless communication, taken up into a wider move- ment of thought never to be arrested and unveiling to us the secret of our capacities for good and evil. That process may reflect God's love, but it can never freeze into a fixed substratum of a knowledge of the Transcendent for man which, if it were possible to attain, would rob man of his freedom. In order that freedom, however, should remain the necessary condition of the realization of man's individual destiny, we must refrain from any pretence to a knowledge of the Transcendence; this would have the effect only of destroy- ing the most essential link of man with God, namely freedom. In their zeal to vindicate Transcendence and assure its permanence in the life of man by appealing to its analogical character (thus bridging the gulf between the finite 258</page><page sequence="5">DISCUSSIONS and the infinite), the critics have shut their eyes to the truth of the funda- mental presupposition of Jaspers, which at the same time constitutes his "critique of Transcendence," namely that "God exists for me in the degree to which I in freedom authentically become myself. He does not exist as a scientific content but only as open- ness to existence .... Since that which is for us must be manifested in the temporality of the world, there can be no direct knowledge of God and existence. There can only be faith."' Another recent critic of Jaspers ought to be mentioned here as well: Heinemanna maintains that the philosophy of existence in the latest works of Jaspers "completes itself, suffers shipwreck and then overcomes itself." It completes itself because its purpose is from the start to pave a way (and keep it open) to Transcendence; but by doing so it suffers shipwreck as a philosophy of exis- tence, because it cannot establish any logic or ethics; it then overcomes itself by recognizing a metaphysics of the Comprehensive, with its acknowledgments of the principles of the Biblical religion, thus breaking the chains of the sphere of existence. This interpretation merely takes sentences from the main work of Jaspers out of their context in order to prove a particular thesis. We maintain that there is a harmonious development of Jaspers' ideas towards their climax in his latest works. Further, against Heinemann, who thinks that a world-spirit guided by Jaspers' ideas could not create anything, for on Jaspers' premise no fixation in the form of any object or thing in nature would be admitted, we must say that such fixation seems to be possible, on Jaspers' own premises, in the existential decision, which could, however, not be a lasting one as it is continually involved in further progress. Further we cannot adopt the stand- point of God and look at things from that Divine viewpoint as Heinemann attempts to do. Likewise, ethical demands naturally follow from Jaspers' theory of Communication, which in fact led him to the adoption of Biblical principles. Thus the idea of moral demands ("ought") remains unconditional for the existential self, whose realization alone assures to it (the existential self) its possible freedom to develop into authentic existence while relating itself to Transcendence.
