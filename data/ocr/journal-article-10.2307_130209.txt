<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Decline of a Dynast: From Power to Love in Aksakov's Family Chronicle RICHARD GREGG A A lthough the generic peculiarities of Family Chronicle have been the main focus of its investigators,1 thematics-to use the convenient neologism-has not been entirely neglected. Thus, commentators are likely to remind us that the larger- than-life proportions of old Bagrov enhance the central theme of the patriarch; that his voyage eastward rehearses the pioneering thrust which informs many narratives of exploration; or that the segments dominated by Aleksei and Sof'ia Nikolaevna embody the themes of urbanization and domesticity. Loosely tying up these (and other) strands is the comment of a recent scholar that the central conflict of the work as a whole is the "incursion of modernity ... on the old way of life."2 To some these truths may seem like truisms. They lie, as it were, on the surface of the text. But this very stricture helps, I think, to define the nature of the narrative. For, with its clear, unhurried, expansive, and richly detailed evocation of an earlier age, Family Chronicle is an unusually pure example of that mimetic mode which Erich Auerbach, in his classic study, called "Homeric." Everything-or al- most everything-in these pages is, in Auerbach's words, "direct," "visible," "lei- surely," "copiously related," and "fully externalized"-a world, as it were, without shadows.3 And it is precisely this manner of relation (applied to the blind Aksakov reciting the heroic exploits of bygone years, the word "Homeric" seems oddly apt) that, according to the critic, lacks polyvalence ("a multiplicity of meanings") and, as a consequence, defies, or at least discourages, "interpretations."4 1 See S.

Present through- out the work, this medium changes as the narrative unfolds. To trace these changes and assess their significance is the main purpose of this article. In the beginning was the trek. Feeling cramped in the confines of his native Simbirsk, and harassed by litigious neighbor-relatives bent on increasing their lands at the expense of his own, Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov, patriarch and "grandfather,"5 having bought some thirteen thousand acres of virgin soil in the Orenburg Province, sets out to the southeast with his family, serfs, and belongings, crosses the Volga, and proceeds to the Ural Piedmont, where, some four hundred versts from his ancestral home, he will build a farmstead, plough fresh lands, and start a new life. Such, in slightly simplified terms, is the narrative core of "The Migration" (pereselenie), the first part of the first segment of Family Chronicle entitled "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov." Despite the unhappiness of the Bagrov serfs at this uprooting, despite the length and the slowness of the journey, executed by stages and in relays, the undertaking is completely successful, for what the pioneers find at the end of their journey is a rural Eden, whose beauties elicit that panegyric that constitutes "Orenburg Province" (Part 2). "My God," exclaims the narrator, "how good was then that wild, virginal, luxurious nature!";6 "how picturesque and varied . . . the forests, steppes and hilly regions" (p. 85); "bright and transparent, like deep, enormous cups, thy lakes;" "marvelous were those. . . rivers" (p. 84), and so forth. Indeed, in the eyes of the eulogist (pace those who see in Aksakov an unfailingly sober realist), the only defect of this "blessed" land would seem to be its vulnerability to human exploitation. An ecologist avant la lettre, he laments: Marvelous and blessed land, Storehouse of terrestial riches, Forgotten one, thou shalt not serve eternally As grazing fields for shepherds. Enamored of thy free expanses, Throngs of men will hasten here And, sullied by their hands, No longer wilt thou know thyself! For they will trample down thy meadows, fell thy forests, And roil the heavenly azure of thy waters! (p. 81) dency, as defined by Auerbach, is characteristic of several of the great exemplars of Russian realism, most notably Tolstoy (himself an admirer of Family Chronicle), whose copious, capacious, and transpar- ent narrative style has obvious "Homeric" affinities. In this respect one recalls that Tolstoy himself claimed that he had The Iliad in mind when he was writing War and Peace. 5 In point of chronological fact, Stepan Mikhailovich is not yet a grandfather. But Aksakov's repeated use in the early chapters of the words staryi and dedushka confer a grandfatherly aura on him from the outset. Dedushka appears in fact in the very first sentence. 6 S. T.

For as the world of Old Bagrovo recedes into the past and the Buguruslan valley opens before us, it is the youth of the earth itself-"green," "fertile," "fresh," and "virginal" (the epithets recur repeatedly)-which we seem to find and, in so doing, observe in ourselves signs of juvenescence: "not only did [Bagrov's] spirits rise, but his body became stronger (pozdorovel telom") (p. 86). Ignorant of the "petitions, com- plaints, [and] quarrels" (p. 86) bred by civilized life, the nomadic tribes, who graze their flocks in peace and lead "patriarchal" lives (p. 84), evoke the pastoral simplici- ties of an earlier age and provide a fitting background for the immemorial activities of ploughing, sowing, and reaping, which the settlers begin to pursue. Or, to put the pseudocontradiction of the folk tale ("in the olden days when the world was young") in a biographical framework: as the aging Aksakov-his frail condition is briefly evoked in these pages (p. 92)-recollects the idyllic places of his childhood, so the reader feels himself retreating in time toward that "antiquity of history," which in Bacon's well-known phrase "is the youth of the world." If Parts 1 and 2 describe the pioneers' trek and the virgin wilderness which awaits them, the heterogeneous and digressive nature of the third part ("New Places") resists neat thematic labeling. Its basic narrative thrust is nonetheless clear: under the guidance of Stepan Mikhailovich, the settlers have consolidated their holdings, while the patriarch himself, by virtue of his honesty and Solomonic wisdom, has become a revered figure throughout the region. As for the fourth section, its basic nature is best understood in the perspective of its antecedents. Having traveled far, acquired much, built tirelessly, and governed well (Parts 1-3), it is natural that the master of New Bagrovo should pause to admire his own handiwork. And, in "Stepan Mikhailovich's Good Day," that is what he does: "It delighted him to look at his manor already equipped with all the necessary build- ings" (p. 93); "viewing the healthy cattle as a sure sign . . . of his peasants' well- being, he was filled with admiration" (p. 93); "out in the fields he was satisfied with everything" (p. 96), and so forth. II Such are the main thematic components of the first chapter of Family Chronicle. Their affinity to certain literary archetypes which perennially recur in a variety of narrative genres is not hard to show. Thus, the long trek of Stepan Mikhailovich to the "promised" land of Orenburg rehearses on a small scale the voyage toward some cherished goal which has informed innumerable narratives from Homer to Tolkien. In Bagrov's excited discovery of a corner of the earth that is pristine and teeming with natural riches we recognize an analogue of the Edens and Arcadias of antiquity, the El Dorados and "brave new worlds" of the Renaissance, and (more recently) those unspoiled wildernesses which provide the natural setting for any number of romantically colored fictions.7 As for the culminating event, the building 7 E.g., Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul et Virginie, Chateaubriand's Atala, Cooper's frontier nov- els and Melville's Typee.</page><page sequence="4">38 Richard Gregg of New Bagrovo and the satisfaction that this achievement provides its builder, the secular cosmogony, describing how human resourcefulness can triumph over natu- ral obstacles to create a viable new order, has since Robinson Crusoe proved to be a perennially popular fictional theme.8 Given the acumen, integrity, great physical strength, and the almost superhu- man energy with which old Bagrov is endowed, it is not surprising that critics have been moved to use such epithets as "colossal," "stupendous," and "epic" to de- scribe him.9 Viewed in surroundings redolent of Biblical times-primitive, pasto- ral, patriarchal-this monolithic creator, ruler, and judge recalls in fact the anthro- pomorphic Jehovah of Genesis Himself.10 Like that all-wise Father-Founder, Bagrov has created a world, given it a name, and peopled it with his people who till its fields and enjoy its bounty. All but infallible in his judgment of men and things- he is to his neighbors a veritable "oracle" (p. 89)-he assumes attitudes that imply omnipotence as well: Lord and master of not only his own lands but of others as well, he could graze his flocks, mow the grass, fell the timber-and no one would say a word. (p. 86) Like the omnipotent Jehovah, however, Bagrov also has a darker side. For when his chosen people seek to deceive him or otherwise limit his power, his anger is terrible to behold: "He shook all over, convulsion twisted his face, and a furious fire welled from his eyes, which had grown dark and turbid with rage" (p. 90). And while the punishment which he metes out is invariably just, the forms which it takes can be shocking. Once the culprit has been duly punished, however, the reign of the "good, benign, even indulgent" (p. 90) autocrat returns. And in "Stepan Mikhailovich's Good Day" (the fourth and final section) we see him, purged as it were of his fury, going out in the early morning freshness (cf. the Biblical "cool of the day") to inspect with deep satisfaction the "garden" he has planted." Reinforcing the Old Testament aura which invests this figure is the small circle of inferior women who surround him. Though not unkind, Arisha, the wife, is a stupid and gullible creature, whose low status may be inferred from the fact that as a sign of special favor Stepan Mikhailovich allows her to kiss his hand. Qualitatively different from their mother, the daughters are depicted in even less attractive colors. Crafty, mendacious, and "without good qualities," these "granddaughters of Eve" (p. 95) come close to fulfilling the role of their Biblical ancestress. For with 8 E.g., such diverse narratives as Wyss' Swiss Family Robinson, the introduction to The Bronze Horseman, Verne's The Mysterious Island, and any number of pioneering or colonizing sagas. 9 Respectively, Ralph E. Matlaw, in the introduction to The Family Chronicle, translated by M. C. Beverley (New York: E. F. Dutton, 1961), p. xix; Carl Van Doren, in the foreword to Aksakov's A Russian Gentleman, translated by J. D. Duff (New York, 1943), p. viii; Mashinskii, p. 324. 10 Without drawing any Biblical parallels Andrew Durkin has before me noted that Bagrov resem- bles a "chthonic deity, both beneficent and punitive" (Durkin, p. 119).

III The trek, the discovery, the creation, the celebration-such are the basic arche- types informing "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov." And the power, mental as well as physical, spiritual as well as mental, of him who launched that voyage, discovered the lands, and built upon them is such that-within the limits of this excerpt at least-any diminution of that power seems inconceivable. The chronological pro- viso is crucial. For, viewed as a whole, Family Chronicle records precisely such a decline. True, Bagrov's authority is never openly challenged: he remains to the last the nominal sovereign of his little world. But as the chronicle unfolds and the narrative focus shifts to include new scenes and faces, the aura of his omnipotence fades. And, by the end, the quondam mover-and-shaker has become a peripheral figure, a crochety and error-prone old man out of touch with events and powerless to control them. Viewed in a literary context, this decline is by no means anomalous. Narra- tives that trace the fortunes of a family from generation to generation often have as their theme the erosion of the dynastic principle-witness Mann's Budden- brooks, Galsworthy's Forsytes, Martin du Garde's Thibaults, and Saltykov- Shchedrin's Golovlevs. But in contrast to these stories of dispersal or decay, Family Chronicle possesses a kind of spiritual resiliency which its-"happy ending" (the birth of the longed-for grandson) can only partly explain. For, as the patriar- chal figure of old Bagrov recedes into the background, another personality, no less vivid for embodying a very different set of values, moves to the fore. It is this displacement that provides the basic dynamics of the work viewed as a whole. It is in the logical-and chronological-order of things that the chapter which follows, "Mikhail Maksimovich Kurolesov," witnesses the first sign of Bagrov's decline.12 Far from attenuating the Old Testament pattern, this chapter lends it an extra dimension. If the omnipotent father-creator of New Bagrovo evokes toutes proportions gardees the anthropomorphic Creator of Eden, the incursion of the satanic tempter, Kurolesov, on His domain cannot but recall-among other, more recent literary models13-the serpent of Genesis. Like the brightest of angels be- fore his fall, Kurolesov is seductively attractive-dashing (molodets soboi), well- spoken, and handsome. (Indeed, not unlike the Antichrist of the Apocalypse, he resembles in certain respects the "Deity," that is, old Bagrov Himself.)14 Beneath this suave and courtly veneer, however, lurks a nechistaia sila (cf. the demonic 12 Actually the marriage of Praskov'ia and Kurolesov straddles the events recounted in "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov," the courtship and wedding occurring before the removal to New Bagrovo, the denouement occurring well after that event. The importance that the theme of declension had for Aksakov is suggested by the fact that he chose to describe the founding of New Bagrovo first, followed by the diabolical inroads of Kurolesov. 13 For a perceptive discussion of the similarities which Kurolesov shares with the hero-villain of the Gothic novel, see Durkin, pp. 121-25. 14 For a more detailed discussion of these resemblances see Feuer, pp. 89-91.</page><page sequence="6">40 Richard Gregg nechistii dukh of popular parlance, p. 112),15 which uses flattery and guile to win over the "granddaughters of Eve," thwarting the will of their lord and master and introducing through his "forbidden" marriage discord into the Bagrov family. Fit- tingly, the perpetrator of these deeds bears a name which evokes his impious essence. For if in modern Russian kurolesit' means to "play tricks" or to "work mischief," etymologically that same verb derives from a sacrilegious distortion of the Kyrie eleison ("Lord have mercy on us") of the Orthodox liturgy. On superficial inspection the image of old Bagrov in these pages might seem unchanged from the first segment. Alone among his entourage, Bagrov is strongly suspicious of Kurolesov, whose suit for the hand of his niece Praskov'ia Ivanovna he opposes. And when at the end he sallies forth to rescue his Praskov'ia from her husband, he inevitably recalls the archetypal deus ex machina of folklore and myth. These heroic manifestations notwithstanding, Bagrov's image in the second seg- ment falls somewhat short of the God-like. Early outmaneuvered by Kurolesov, who takes advantage of Bagrov's ill-timed absence to compass his schemes, Bagrov is later guilty of less pardonable lapses. Impressed by Kurolesov's respectful de- meanor and managerial skills, he disregards his own inner promptings, is reconciled with his "nephew," and even promises him-conditionally to be sure-his "love and friendship" (p. 114). On hearing reports of the latter's bloodthirsty excesses at Parashino, Bagrov is at first incredulous and, when offered irrefutable proof of their truth, he refuses to take any action at all, on the morally questionable grounds that these "filthy doings" are no concern of his (p. 130). It is only when his niece herself falls afoul of Kurolesov's fury that his connivance with lawlessness-for it amounts to that-comes to an end and he decides to act. As the superhuman aura surrounding old Bagrov begins to fade, a new positive force, embodied in Praskov'ia Ivanovna, makes itself felt. True, Parasha's debut is not auspicious. A pampered and childish girl (on the eve of her wedding she is still playing with dolls), she is an easy mark for Kurolesov and her scheming cousins. "Miraculously," however, that marriage, which in the long run proves so disastrous, works immediate effects that are beneficial. Within a year's time, we are told, the flighty fiancee has grown into a woman of maturity, wisdom, and lasting affections. These changes notwithstanding, it will be more than a decade before Praskov'ia's mettle will be put to a serious test. Protected from the facts by her insularity (only on far-lying estates does Kurolesov give rein to his sadistic instincts) and a mis- placed sense of conjugal loyalty, she remains unsuspecting-despite dark rumors and Kurolesov's prolonged absences. But finally, when she receives a circumstantial account of her husband's crimes from an unimpeachable source, she embarks on a course of action that, Aksakov tells us, even "the most daring of men" would hesitate to undertake (p. 125). Rounding up three servants, she sets out on a 250- mile journey to confront the accused. Catching him red-handed (an orgy is in full swing as she arrives), she demands that he surrender the powers of attorney once granted him. Infuriated, he beats her senseless, locks her up, and for five days tries 15 By using such expressions in connection with Kurolesov as "on rassypalsia ... melkim besom" (p. 109) and "chort emu ne brat" (p. 104), Aksakov further reinforces Kurolesov's diabolical aura.</page><page sequence="7">The Decline of a Dynast 41 in vain to force his battered and feverish prisoner to sign over the estates in ques- tion. "What might have happened next," Aksakov speculates, "God only knows" (p. 129). In fact, when old Bagrov finally arrives after six days, the woman whom he rescues has little in common with the languishing "damsel in distress" of fictional stereotypes. By dint of her bold initiatives, steadfast defiance under duress, and deep religious faith, Praskov'ia has proved herself to be an authentically heroic heroine, the moral equal of her deliverer. IV Many years had gone by, and many events had taken place [in the Orenburg region]; there had been famine; there had been epidemic dis- eases; there had been Pugachev's uprising. (p. 138) With this laconic recital of mass misfortunes the third segment begins. For the chronicler, however, these epic disturbances are incidental to the simple fact that "old" Bagrov, whose apparent noninvolvement in these events may be sympto- matic, has grown truly old: this fact sets in motion a major shift in the narrative focus. Advancing now to the center of the stage are Aleksei Stepanovich (the son) and Sof'ia Nikolaevna Zubina (successively fiancee, wife and mother), whose ro- mance and marriage constitute the subject of the last three segments: "The Mar- riage of Young Bagrov," "The Newlyweds at Bagrovo," and "Life at Ufa." In itself this shift is hardly remarkable, the eclipse of the older generation by the younger being a constituent part of any "dynastic" narrative. But as the account of the young couple's betrothal unfolds, it becomes clear that another, quite differ- ent change has occurred, a change that-by the standards of the age at least-was anything but normal, namely, the displacement of the male-oriented world which has heretofore obtained by a gynocentric one in the middle of which stands Sof'ia Nikolaevna herself. This change does not come entirely unheralded. Already, Praskov'ia Ivanovna had during the course of the Kurolesov chapter risen far above the ruck of feminine mediocrity embodied by Arisha and her daughters. But however courageous her conduct may have been, it posed no threat to the traditional principle that in marriage the husband should lead and the wife should follow. The example of Sof'ia Nikolaevna in the last three excerpts does exactly that. The vast superiority of this beautiful and brilliant woman to her gauche and simple-minded suitor (later husband) is, arguably, the basic underlying fact of these chapters: compounded by parental opposition on both sides, it not only constitutes a major obstacle to their marital plans, it will later become a source of continuing tension between husband and wife. And precisely because this discrepancy looms so large, it tends to obscure a third fundamental change in the values that obtain in these chapters-a change related to, and yet quite different from the slow eclipse of the patriarch on one hand or the ascendancy of a strong female on the other: in short, the emergence of love as the regnant moral principle. In the traditional sense, love is almost entirely absent from the first two segments-the fear, devotion, and awe that Sergei Mikhailovich variously in- spires in his entourage having little to do with that affect as it is commonly</page><page sequence="8">42 Richard Gregg understood.16 We are therefore scarcely surprised to learn that Bagrov seems never to have experienced romantic love and has no understanding of it (p. 153). Symptomatic in this respect is the fact that the only relationship described in these pages where romantic love plays any role, namely, the courtship of Praskov'ia, is founded on deceit and ends in disaster. To propose that the "love ethic" (to adapt the popular phrase) displaces that of power in the last three segments does not mean, however, that the former vanishes without a trace. Stepan Mikhailovich remains, after all, the head of the family and continues to exercise-though to a diminished degree-the prerogatives of that position. More surprisingly, on closer inspection, the character of Sof'ia Nikolaevna reveals a temperamental affinity to that of the autocrat himself. For, analyzing the reasons why the urbane and brilliant Sof'ia Nikolaevna responds to Aleksei's over- tures more sympathetically than one might under the circumstances expect, Aksakov observes that in the depths of her nature lay a "love for power" (p. 167) which the prospect of a docile and pliable husband might well appease. The persistence in muted (or transmuted) form of a power ethic qualifies but does not undermine the primacy of love in the last "half" of the chronicle, its most obvious manifestation being, of course, Aleksei's love for Sof'ia Nikolaevna, as related in "The Marriage of Young Bagrov." Replete with vicissitudes of various kinds-the most formidable being old Bagrov's resolute opposition to the match- Aleksei's courtship is crowned with success when Bagrov, acting under his despair- ing son's threat of suicide, relents. No star-crossed swain in the sentimental novels of which he is fond could have suffered more pathetically or triumphed more completely.17 Amor omnia vincit or, as Sonia herself succinctly puts it, "Vasha liubov' preodolela vse prepiatsviia" (p. 180). As if to orchestrate his main theme, Aksakov makes his heroine the object of love in a variety of nonromantic contexts. Thus, we are told that her weak and ailing father loves his daughter passionately (p. 140), that Katerina Alekseevna Cheprunova, a female relative, adores her endlessly (p. 251), and that Ufa high society was positively smitten by her beauty (p. 144). But easily the most important of Sof'ia's platonic admirers is, of course, Stepan Mikhailovich himself. For if, as the title denotes, the subject of the fourth segment is the newlyweds' visit to New Bagrovo, its underlying theme is the unusually close and touching relationship that develops between the bride and her father-in-law. True, there is a touch of calcula- tion here: to consolidate her position in her new family, Sof'ia must, she knows, ingratiate herself with its strongest member. But the bond which spontaneously springs up between the young woman and the aging patriarch, replete with delicate attentions and chaste embraces, transcends selfish considerations and indeed re- 16 True, we are told that Bagrov's serfs "loved" (liubili) him (p. 89), but the Russian word is less emphatic than the English, and the respect and devotion which a serf can have for his master (a fortiori, a master who is capable of meting out brutal punishment when crossed) can scarcely be called love in the conventional sense. 17 Durkin (p. 133) connects the account of Aleksei's passionate courtship with the sentimental fiction of the age. Aksakov himself states that the desperate suitor's threat to commit suicide if the parental ban is not lifted was doubtless inspired by the novels he had read (p. 161).</page><page sequence="9">The Decline of a Dynast 43 suits in a unique kind of emotional fulfillment for each. In Stepan Mikhailovich, Sof'ia finds that wise and resolute paterfamilias that her weak-willed father had so signally failed to be. In Sof'ia, Bagrov recognizes a woman who so far surpasses the members of his own immediate family in character and charm that she quickly assumes-to the dismay of her sisters-in-law-a privileged position within its con- fines. Precisely this shared spiritual superiority confers on this unlikely pair-so profoundly different in many respects-a dignity which the tense and agitated courtship of unequals (the brilliant Sof'ia wooed by the uncouth Aleksei) too often lacks. Of all the feelings that human beings can feel, none, Aksakov assures us, is as deep or as powerful as maternal love (p. 274). It is therefore fitting that the culmi- nating member of the "love triptych" (as the last three segments might be called) should exemplify this emotion. For Sof'ia Nikolaevna's love for her firstborn is of quite exceptional intensity. All her energies, all her thoughts are absorbed by her baby girl, the loving care for whom becomes a jealously preserved monopoly. Alas, this obsession (for it amounts to that) is as short-lived as it is intense. Four months after her birth, little Praskov'ia-sickly from the start-is dead. The grief of the bereaved mother is such that her family fears for her sanity, and-when she falls ill-for her life itself. This harrowing ordeal emphasizes by way of contrast the joyous events that are to follow and that conclude the chronicle-the full recovery of Sof'ia Nikolaevna and the arrival of her second-born. Described far more circumstantially than its antecedent, this pregnancy is twice blessed. Not only does the baby live, but to the joy of old Bagrov it is a boy. That the mother will love her little son as passionately as she had her infant daughter can scarcely be doubted.18 One further dimension of this "love syndrome" remains to be noted, namely Sof'ia Nikolaevna's love of God. The absence of religious motifs in the earlier "epic" sections of the work19 is somewhat surprising, given its "slavophile" aura, and may well be rooted in the requirements of Dichtung as well as those of Wahrheit: If old Bagrov had regularly exhibited the reverential and obedient atti- tudes implicit in the man-God relationship, his own aura of absolute omnipotence would be somewhat diminished. Such is not the case with Sof'ia Nikolaevna. Protected by the gender-related stereotype of the "naturally" pious female, she is, like Praskov'ia before her, both heroic and deeply religious. Among the repeated manifestations of these traits, the first is by far the most memorable. Daily tormented by the persecutions of her stepmother, the fifteen-year-old girl decides to put an end to her life. Having prayed long and fervently before the icon of the Virgin, she faints away, only to discover, on coming to her senses, that the taper that she had extinguished the night 18 This supposition is borne out by the passionate love that Sof'ia Nikolaevna bears little Sergei, described in "The Childhood Years of Bagrov Grandson" (pp. 288-94). 19 Bagrov's resolve to build a church on his newly acquired estate, fulfilled many years later by his son (p. 81), and his passing expression of gratitude to God for a good wheat crop (p. 96) do not, it seems to me, exceed conventional gestures of piety.</page><page sequence="10">44 Richard Gregg before is now burning brightly. Seeing in this small miracle (the only supernatural occurrence in the work) proof that her love for God is actively reciprocated, Sof'ia finds the strength to endure her martyrdom until the providential death of her tormentor. V In view of Aleksei's triumph over his father's explicit wishes, it is, in a sense, as victors that the newlyweds arrive at New Bagrovo (fourth segment), where it is now Sof'ia Nikolaevna's turn to play the role of the conqueror. For through her devoted attentions, manifold charms, and, even, small hypocrisies (her interest in New Bagrovo is wholly feigned: she detests the place) this "sorceress" (the word is Bagrov's) in a few short days completely captures the old man's heart: "Ia bol'no poliubil tebia," he confesses as they part (p. 236). But there is more to Sof'ia's conquest than this. By virtue of her charisma she has, in effect, uncovered a new person: a tender, generously affectionate old man (the word laska and its deriva- tives accompany the couple like a leitmotif) who contrasts strikingly with the stern autocrat of earlier years. Thus, when on one occasion the newlyweds fail to meet the time-hallowed dinner hour, Bagrov stuns the assembled company by-an un- heard of concession-delaying the meal for a few minutes. Or again, accustomed to giving uninhibited vent to his anger when provoked, in the presence of Sof'ia Nikolaevna he quells an incipient outburst, and even feels "ashamed" of his impulse (p. 225). Or still again, in the bosom of his own family this pillar of male supremacy is obliged to witness-not, to be sure, without protest-Sof'ia Nikolaevna's cava- lier treatment of her husband, that is, of his own son. Most modern readers will applaud these breaches of "chauvinist" etiquette. But it is precisely from such a code-redolent at times of the domostroi-that the icon of the earlier chapters was partly constructed. In his more human-and more humane-form Stepan Mikhailovich forfeits some of his larger-than-life dimensions. The gradual disappearance of these dimensions leaves, it should be empha- sized, an impressive human being intact. Less awe-inspiring than in the first ex- cerpt, Bagrov remains during the "middle" chapters a person whose sound judg- ment and unimpeachable rectitude command the respect of all who know him. In the fifth and final segment, however, it is precisely his stature as a human being that suffers diminution. One reason for this is the sharply altered narrative focus. Although in the second, third, and fourth segments Bagrov has ceased to be the monolithic pres- ence that dominated "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov," crucial episodes in each, for example, the rescue of Praskov'ia Ivanovna, the marriage of Aleksei, the idyll with Sof'ia Nikolaevna, continue to hinge on his decisions, his acts. Without him the narrative structure of these chapters would collapse. This is hardly true of "Life in Ufa." Removed from the events taking place in the city (the young couple does not return to New Bagrovo; he never visits Ufa), Stepan Mikahilovich now stands at the periphery of things, his brief appearances in the narrative depending on events beyond his control. Even passive, peripheral characters can sometimes influence the course of</page><page sequence="11">The Decline of a Dynast 45 events by the sheer force of their personalities, but Bagrov of the fifth segment fails even in this. Age has impaired his powers of judgment; his opinions, ill-informed and rooted in prejudice, are ignored; his only "positive" act produces disastrous results. Specifically, the old man's absolute certainty that his daughter-in-law will present him with a grandson not only smacks of hubris (one thinks of some primi- tive potentate, who cannot believe that nature will disobey his will), it is patently silly. And when Sof'ia finally delivers a daughter, Bagrov's incredulity and bewilder- ment are such that he becomes what he has never been before-ridiculous (p. 256). More seriously, while his contempt for female offspring is, if judged by the "sexist" standards of that age, not unusual, his complete indifference to the death of Sof'ia's adored baby girl is more than "chauvinistic"-it is repellent. Or again, when, ignoring the facts of the case, he rebukes Sof'ia for "deserting" her sick father (it is in point of fact the spite of a scheming servant, coupled with Zubin's abject weak- ness, which drives her from the paternal home), he is both meddlesome and wrong. Similarly misguided are his petulant protests-fortunately unheeded-against the regimen (kumys and horseback riding) prescribed for his gravely ill daughter-in- law. Precisely these remedies, we are given to believe, speed her recovery. Emblematic of this quasi-senile capriciousness is the way Bagrov chooses to celebrate the news of Sof'ia's first, ill-fated pregnancy. Acting on a whim, he forces a handsome young male serf to marry a spiteful and ugly maidservant ten years his senior. The result of this union is, not surprisingly, a calamity for both. And while it would be wrong to impute deliberate cruelty to Bagrov's motives (for mysterious reasons the old man is fond of the shrew in question), the moral obtuseness of his choice, underscored by his apparent indifference to the misery he has caused, is obvious. A decade earlier, one is permitted to think, such an act on his part would have been unthinkable. In contrast to these dispiriting pictures of senescence is the image of Bagrov in the culminating scene. Apprised by a messenger that Sof'ia has given birth to a baby boy, the old man makes the sign of the cross, rises from his bed, takes down the family register, and enters the name of him who will ensure the survival of the Bagrov dynasty. On this triumphant note Family Chronicle comes to an end. And yet, while the picture just sketched is true in every detail, the same event may be viewed from a much less flattering angle: far removed from the festivities at Ufa, an enfeebled old man, barefoot and apparently alone, scrambles out of bed to record the name of the infant who will (vanitas vanitatum!) perpetuate his name. And in truth, this second, "subversive" portrait is the better likeness of the crotchety figure whom we sporadically glimpse in these pages. For Ufa, not New Bagrovo, is now the locus of events; the domestic life at Ufa-replete with the problems that typi- cally beset young married couples (the ailing parent, the jealous spouse, the diffi- cult pregnancy)-constitutes its subject. And at its center stands the spiritual heir (and temperamental opposite) of Stepan Mikhailovich, the brilliant, high-strung Sof'ia, who comes to embody the deepest of all human emotion (sic Aksakov) maternal love. The transformations which I have traced need no further elaboration. But one can gain a deeper insight into their significance if one compares the thematic</page><page sequence="12">46 Richard Gregg substance of the first and final segments in terms of two synchronic images or icons. Thus, while individual responses will vary, certain iconic constants may be recog- nized in "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov." Specifically, against a backdrop of untamed wilderness are scattered the appurtenances of the Bagrov farmstead (ploughed fields, fences, buildings); in the middle distance are grouped its creatures (family, domestic animals, serfs), while in the foreground, proudly surveying his posses- sions, rises the monolithic figure of the founding father. And while the resemblance this fourfold configuration bears to the iconography of Genesis (wilderness, crea- tures, garden, Creator) has already been indicated, when juxtaposed to the ruling icon of the final segment it becomes sharper by way of contrast. For few would dispute the basic visual image which "Life at Ufa" evokes: standing before us is a young mother; in her arms her adored child, while in the background looms the figures of the half-forgotten husband. And that of course is an icon which recalls the Gospel account of the Nativity. These Biblical analogues could, of course, be accidental. In describing the creation of New Bagrovo and the birth of Praskov'ia (and later Sergei), Aksakov may have had neither Eden nor the Nativity specifically in mind. What lends a more-than-adventitious character to these parallels is their affinity to that "transval- uation of values" which we have been tracing here. For if Power, Male Supremacy, and the Patriarchal Family are concepts central to "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov," then the congruence of imagery recalling the Old Testament, where these same ideas play such a crucial role, is obvious. At the opposite end of the spectrum: if the "Ufa chapters" mark the emergence of a gynocentric world, in which the "love ethic," the Christian religion, and the cult of motherhood figure prominently, is not an icon recalling the Holy Family an apt symbol of that world? VI "The old order changeth." And it may be appropriate by way of conclusion to ask how the modern reader is likely to respond to the fact. If ethics were our only guide, we would scarcely hesitate. However greatly we may admire the acumen, courage, and rectitude of Stepan Mikhailovich, his autocratic and sometimes savage exercise of power cannot be condoned. In comparison the "love ethic" embodied by Sof'ia Nikolaevna marks a step in the direction of comity and enlightenment. Esthetic criteria, however, offer a more ambiguous perspective. As the larger- than-life figure of old Bagrov recedes into the background; as Buguruslan's primi- tive wilderness gives way to the smaller, more confined surroundings of Ufa; as the long-range, "wide-lens" view of man in nature yields to a more tightly knit urban society, perceived at closer quarters and in more intimate psychological detail; as, in sum, the "civilized" world, repudiated by Bagrov a generation earlier, begins to reassert itself (we have, in a sense, come full circle), the heroic dimension of the narrative inevitably suffers eclipse. More specifically, if, as we have seen, "Stepan Mikhailovich Bagrov" relates the creation of a new world, its analogue in the last segment is "merely" the birth of a baby boy. If, in the early parts, domestic strife sporadically erupts in the sudden, seismic rages of old Bagrov, later the same theme assumes the more prosaic form of the repeated squabbling of the newlyweds. Or</page><page sequence="13">The Decline of a Dynast 47 again, whereas Kurolesov is a villain of truly satanic stature, who, pitted against an even more formidable adversary, is eventually overcome, his villainous counterpart in "Life in Ufa" is Zubin's scheming manservant, a melkii bes, whose crafty manipu- lation of his weak master ultimately succeeds. Finally-and on a quite different level-if, as few would deny, low comedy tends to undermine the epic afflatus, then the introduction in the later segments of such buffoonish types as the drunken scandalmonger, Flena Ivanovna, the wildly mendacious Afrosin'ia Andreevna, and Klaus, Sof'ia Nikolaevna's yellow-wigged obstetrician, cannot but further reduce the epic scale of things. It is, however, a revolution in literary taste, culminating in the early years of the author's own life, that provides the most suggestive generic framework for the changes we have been tracing. As late as the 1770s (the decade of old Bagrov's migration), educated Russians continued to exalt the epic above all genres.20 And, as noted, the early parts of our chronicle offer a setting (the simple, spacious, primitive world of bygone days), characters (the all-powerful hero-leader, his dia- bolical adversary), and an array of themes (the long voyage, the discovery, the cosmogony-all accomplished by a single, sovereign will) that had unmistakable affinities with that genre. But with the advent in Russia of Sentimentalism (c. 1790), the epic yielded pride of place to a less lofty narrative type. Focused on the contemporary scene, eschewing larger-than-life people and events, depicting men and women in a societal context,21 assigning central roles to female characters, and preferring the theme of love (licit or illicit, passionate or platonic) to that of the odyssey, the conquest, or the foundation, the sentimental novel offered its (pre- dominantly female) readers a world with which they could more easily identify. This is the world and these are the values that, as we have seen, emerge in the Ufa chapters. And while the eclipse of the epic ambiance of Buguruslan cannot but evoke in us a sense of loss, entering the more "novelistic" surroundings of Ufa, the modern reader will find by way of compensation a more familiar world, more reassuringly ordinary, more imbued with values that are recognizably his own. 20 The most famous eighteenth-century Russian epic poem, Kheraskov's Rossiada , was published in 1779. 21 As Durkin notes (p. 142), the society of Ufa exemplifies Gesellschaft, as defined by German nineteenth-century sociologists, the world of New Bagrovo-Gemeinschaft.</page></plain_text>
