<plain_text><page sequence="1">Messages and Meaning of African Court Arts: Warrior Figures from the Bamrnum Kingdom By Christraud M. Geary As vehicles of communication, Afri- can arts carry messages and com- ment upon society, qualities that have attracted Africanist scholars trained in anthropology, history, and sociology to research the tangible record from their disciplinary perspectives. Their concern with material expressions of societal concepts reflects the constant striving of Africanists for source materials to explore African thought. In the course of analyzing material articulation some of these scholars have become concerned with form, creativity, and aesthetics, the traditional domains of art historians. Recent art-historical work on Africa combines the more classic art-historical approaches with contextual analysis. Art historians have ventured into other disciplines, mainly anthropology and history, in order to explore the meaning of objects. This shift in emphasis has led to a rapprochement of all disciplines involved in research on African arts. Rationales for research and strategies of exploration may differ in these disci- plines, but in the final analysis all research on African art-be it of art objects as such or of objects or events in other domains that can be grasped through the study of art-shares the concern with meanings. Furthermore, these different approaches, far from being mutually exclusive, may actually illuminate each other. In the following, I shall try to demonstrate how a combina- tion of different methodologies and forms of interpretation practiced in art history, in anthropology, and in history leads to a fuller understanding of the messages and meaning of artworks, in this case of a corpus of warrior figures from the Bamum kingdom in Cameroon.' The mode of interpretation commonly used by art historians elicits the mean- ing of objects by anlayzing their formal qualities and iconography as the mani- festations of underlying principles.2 It is assumed that form and theme mirror fundamental concepts prevalent in the societies in which an artwork was cre- ated. For the African context, Douglas Fraser and Herbert Cole explored these notions in their pioneering book on Afri- can art and leadership, in which formal characteristics of objects were linked with multiple functional aspects and the history of the pieces as they relate to the leadership context.3 This framework offers a useful start- ing point, especially when studying court arts, the most obvious manifesta- tion of arts of leadership. African court arts have always attracted the attention of researchers. Political structure, the role of arts at the court, forms of patron- age, the use of elite mediums, the rich but conventional expressions, and the flamboyance of display are seemingly familiar phenomena and allow quick and easy conclusions about meaning. Such seeming familiarity, however, may result in superficial analyses or may even be deceiving. In order to grasp the subtleties and explore the meaning of court arts, the approach suggested by Fraser and Cole needs to be expanded by combining it with other modes of inquiry, such as symbolic analysis. The creation of a theoretical frame- work for cross-cultural symbolic analy- sis has been a concern of anthropology and has led to the development of one of several schools of thought in this disci- pline. In the African context, symbolic analysis has been greatly influenced by Victor Turner and Mary Douglas.4 In this mode of interpretation, symbols should be seen as emanating from and referring back to indigenous systems of thought and to indigenous classifica- tions that give meaning. It is erroneous to assume the universality of classifica- tions and of symbols, and consequently to apply our Eurocentric system of clas- sification in this type of analysis. A primary concern of the researcher who studies works of art from this point of view, no matter what her or his disciplin- ary affiliation, thus rests with the analy- sis of the presuppositions and common values that the members of a particular society share and that find expression in their classificatory systems.5 A historical mode of inquiry into African art greatly enhances knowledge about the objects as such and, in a more art-historical vein, the development of styles as a historical phenomenon. Another type of historical investigation concerns the temporal setting of objects and pertains to general historical pro- cesses in societies from which the objects emanated. It is, of course, common knowledge that early inquiry into Afri- can art stressed the timeless, primordial quality of the works and their settings, that is, the synchronic rather than the diachronic view. In this, it followed ear- lier anthropological paradigms that have long since been redefined by anthropologists and Africanist histori- ans. Historical emphasis in art research has received much attention and discus- sion since the recent publication of Jan Vansina's book on art history in Africa, in which he stresses the need for apply- ing proper historical methods to the study of art.6 In my view, the most fruitful work can be done at the intersection of these Summer 1988 103</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 Finial of a war standard, late nineteenth or early twentieth century, brass, h. 28 cm, Bamum, Cameroon. Foumban, Bamum Palace Museum. approaches, the formal, the functional, the symbolic, and the historical. The following analysis of a corpus of warrior figures from the Bamum kingdom of Cameroon (see map) draws on these domains of inquiry. uman figures, in particular an- thropomorphic sculptures, are rel- atively rare in the Bamum repertoire.7 Within this genre, warrior figures emerge as a specific corpus. While trac- ing Bamum pieces in situ and in museum collections, I recorded several warrior images executed in different mediums and belonging to different ensembles. Two of them-one in Foum- ban, the other formerly in Berlin (Figs. 1 and 2)-are small brass finials of war standards.8 A different type of warrior image appears as a component of splen- did, beaded two-figure thrones (Fig. 3). All these thrones consist of a stool ele- ment with two almost life-size guardian figures and a separate, benchline foot- rest with two warriors crouching on either side of it (Figs. 4 and 5). The most striking image in the corpus is that of an equestrian warrior, which serves as a crest worn by the head of the Bamum army during his installation (Fig. 6). The occurrence of the warrior imag- ery immediately raises questions related to Bamum history. To what extent is the prominence of this genre an indication of historical emphases and processes? The answers can be drawn from written sources that illuminate the history of the kingdom. In most instances in Africa, such written sources were produced by outsiders to the culture-military men, colonial administrators, missionaries, anthropologists, or historians-who fol- lowed Western notions of historiography and patterns of analysis. For Bamum, however, we possess a unique historical record from the Bamum point of view. Eyewitness accounts and traditions nar- rated at the turn of the century about Bamum history and society were recorded at the royal court in a script invented by the then King Njoya and his courtiers. The editing of this history began in 1910 and was closely super- vised and censored by the king, so that it represents the "official version" of Bamum history as perceived by the king and the Bamum elite. The "Histoire," as I shall refer to it here, emphasizes the Bamum concepts of kingship and war- fare as major elements in the develop- ment of the Bamum state.9 The members of the Bamum elite divided their past into a sequence of reigns by strong and weak kings. Gener- osity, willpower, cunning, even cruelty afforded the monarch admiration, but no quality seems to have been more important than military prowess.10 The authors of the "Histoire" emphasize the warlike spirit of their rulers as one of the three pillars of a Bamum king's exis- tence, the other two being his role as the supreme mediator and the guardian of fertility.'1 The past is perceived not only in monarchic terms but in military terms as well. Tales of successful battles and conquest abound. Many are similar to the following passage dealing with King Mbuembue's campaign against the Pu'. Mbuembue ruled Bamum from about 1820 to 1840. The narrative relates how King Mbuembue by acci- dent was caught in a ditch and would have faced certain death at the hands of his opponents, had not his retainers managed to save him. This passage shows the attention to detail in the account and the colorful, lavish descrip- tion of events, which is typical of the tone of the "Histoire." It also demon- strates that Bamum men defined their identity primarily in an idiom stressing warlike demeanor. The narrative thus complements and elaborates the visual record.12 King Mbuembue made war at Mapu' [the location where the Pu' lived]. The Pu' had hidden them- selves along the roadside. Un- knowingly, the king placed himself in the middle of his enemies. When the Bamum had all passed by, the Pu' emitted their war cry: "Wuo nda nge! Wuo nda nge! The fish have entered the net!" they said. "Let us cut! Let us cut!" And they began to kill many Bamum. King Mbuembue wanted to flee, but he fell into a hole. In order to protect him, the retainers placed themselves in four rows behind him. The first three rows were massacred by the Pu', but three new rows formed immediately. The fight was fierce. "Have you not said that you were strong in war?", one of the enemy asked King Mbuembue. "Do you not have warriors with you? Is the fight fierce?"

Berlin, Museum fur Volkerkunde. "Yuem," said the king, "re- sound the call to war." Yuem fol- lowed this order. The attack of the enemy was broken, the Pu' took flight.... Then the Pu' pulled out their swords and killed the Ba- mum who had pursued them. They found King Mbuembue still in the hole. The Bamum took flight, but the three rows of servants once again closed behind King Mbuem- bue to protect him. The Pu' killed the men in the first two rows, and only one remained near the king. Njilie Ngurap, a son of King Kuo'tu [Mbuembue's father], re- alized the unfavorable situation of the king. He swore: "Nshanku ngiiri! One should throw a spear to the head of ngiiri [ngiiri is a secret society of princes], Moomfopa' [another name for Mbuembue]! You love the war; is the head of a man not your nourishment? Give me spears so that I can remove the elephant [praise name for the king] from the hole where he is right now." "Give him my bundle of spears," said the king. When he received them, the retainer Tapshe said to him: "You cannot take all the spears; give some to the retain- ers." This is what Ngurap did. All attacked the Pu' unprotected. Njilie decapitated four enemies; Tapshe did the same. The heads were put in a bag and carried to the king when he was just about to leave the ditch. A Pu' had climbed into the ditch with the intention to kill the king with his own sword, but it was Yuem who killed the enemy with the sword that he had intended to use. He cut his head off. "Give me spears once again," said Njilie Ngurap, "so that one does not see the back of the ele- phant." Ngu Maanjem swore: "Ndom ngiiri! We shall rise together this time." And all three, Njilie Ngurap, Tapshe, Ngu Maanjem, attacked together.

"I could have been seized by the Pu'," said King Mbuem- bue, when he returned to Foum- ban, "but my retainers formed a living rampart around me. There- fore they shall be called 'Paanka' [people of the barrier]."'3 The historical content of this narrative revolves around the Bamum defeat of the Pu', who then became part of the ever-increasing numbers of groups un- der Bamum domination. Additionally, the narrative provides a charter de- scribing the intimate relationship be- tween the king and his retainers and princes, who act here as the protectors of the kingship, an idealized role that they did not always assume in the course of Bamum history. The authors of the "Histoire" also stress the importance of the enemy's head, not only by mention- ing decapitation several times but also by alluding to heads "as a man's nour- ishment," a metaphor that I shall return to later. In this and other passages of the "Histoire," the bellicose attitude clearly emerges as the key concept in the Bamum elite's self-image. lsewhere, I have described the stra- tegic and ritual aspects of Bamum warfare and I shall therefore summarize here only some characteristics pertinent to the topic of the warrior figures.'4 Campaigns were initiated routinely dur- ing the dry season. The preparation of the warriors required not only physical training carried out in their respective warrior societies but also strengthening through war medicines that had to be prepared by experts. In the second half of the nineteenth century, protective leather amulets were added to these medicines and worn to battle. The Bamum began to appreciate these Islamic amulets after they had fought several wars against the Islamic Fulbe. Although the Fulbe were unsuccessful in their attempts to defeat Bamum, their strong war medicines had so impressed the Bamum that they procured their own amulets from Hausa traders. The Bamum warriors were divided into sev- eral armies under the leadership of the tu panka, the head of the guards, and ferociously attacked their enemies. Fre- quently, the king himself would partici- pate in the campaigns. The primary goal of a warrior in battle was the decapita- tion of the enemy. Once the campaign had been won, the defeated populations were enslaved with as many prisoners as possible taken. The climactic conclusion of these activities was the victory celebration (ngu) after each successful war. During the celebration, the warriors received lavish presents from the king and danced with their trophies much in the manner reported and photographed by the German missionary Martin G6hring in 1906 (Fig. 7). This, by the way, seems to be the only contemporary account of ngu by a European observer. Upon his [King Njoya's] return [from the war with the neighbor- ing Nso], a celebration of joy was held in Bamum. The queen moth- er, radiating happiness, wore sev- eral lower jaws from severed Banso heads on a string of beads around her neck. I have never seen so many people assembled as dur- ing these festivities. There was dancing and shooting, and by the end a large quantity of palm wine had been consumed.15 Gohring's photograph shows the vigor- ous dance movements of Bamum war- riors in their most impressive dress, ornate loincloths, feather headdresses, and jewelry. In battle, too, the Bamum warriors would wear this prestigious attire, visually stating their wealth and power to intimidate the opponent. Two of the dancers to the right hold enemy skulls in their left hands. The treatment of warfare as the cen- tral element in Bamum testimony about the past accurately reflects the pivotal role of military conquest in the forma- tion processes and the maintenance of the Bamum state. Bamum's political and economic strength in the nineteenth century depended almost solely on constant expansion as a form of produc- tion, and on the increasing involvement in trading activities.'6 During King Mbuembue's rule, the kingdom under- went major transformations owing to his numerous successful campaigns. In its configuration throughout the nineteenth century, Bamum was basically his cre- ation, because the kings who succeeded him never lived up to or surpassed his exploits.17 Fig. 7 Victory celebration and warriors' dance in Foumban, photographed 1906 by Martin G6hring (Archives of the Basel Mission, Switzerland, no.

I 3, ;. i lo..t!; )il 1.11- -S f ll</page><page sequence="5">The territorial and economic expan- sion under Mbuembue went hand in hand with artistic proliferation of remarkable proportions. For many rea- sons the dramatic increase in artistic activity is a common phenomenon in successful warrior states in Africa.18 With regard to Bamum it can be partly explained with the increased control over the long-distance trade routes that crossed the Bamum territory and with the role of the Bamum as middlemen in the trade of prestigious goods that would come from the Atlantic coast and from the north, from regions located in what is now Nigeria. Through trade Bamum gained access to such elite mediums as brass and European-manufactured glass beads, mediums that figure prominently in court art.'9 Of equal importance seem to be the inherent messages that art objects convey in the psychological realm. The Bamum kings were fully aware of the emotive quality of objects and used them in the grand design of exercising political power. The manipulation of objects, how- ever, goes beyond the realm of accumu- lating wealth and stating power through display. During expansion, the Bamum acquired not only prestigious materials for artistic production but also the cap- tive creators of the artworks. Thus the subjugated artists' creations expressed two leitmotifs of Bamum politics in the visual domain: domination and control by the palace of the artists and their products on the one hand; and their artistic production for the palace as an integrative factor on the other. Both domination and integration of the con- quered were major elements in Bamum political action. With few exceptions, artists who worked under the patronage of the king were members of subjugated groups and had been resettled near the palace in Foumban. Most important among them were the artists in the lineage of nji Nkome (nji is a title of nobility given by the king to meritorious retainers). Nji Nkome was the son of the king of Ma- nguot, a small kingdom first attacked in the seventeenth century by Nshare Yen, the founder of the Bamum kingdom. The Nguot fled, thus preserving their autonomy. They settled south of Foum- ban, but were finally subdued by King Mbuembue in the second decade of the nineteenth century. A skilled brass cas- ter and carver nji Nkome had been relocated to Foumban by King Mbue- mbue and worked for the court during the early to the mid nineteenth cen- tury.20 Bead embroiderers who covered wooden sculptures with colorful bead- work belonged to the defeated group of the Mengnam. To this day, these origins Fig. 8 Palace servant holaing the war standard, pictured in Fig. 1. Bamum, Cameroon. Photographed 1977. of the court artists are remembered in Bamum. To what degree did the origin of the artists affect the style and iconography of the artworks produced for the court? When asked about court arts, most Bamum at the palace relate a topos common to all historical narratives about the beginnings of art production. According to their own testimony, the Bamum originally had no carving and casting skills. They were men of war. With the arrival of the subjugated art- ists, various art forms were introduced at the court. Clearly, this statement must be interpreted as a metaphor for the complex developmental processes of the court arts. I suggest that it refers above all to these artists' creative input and the proliferation of the court arts rather than to a beginning ex nihilo. These artists formulated the court style, which was highly conventionalized and remained constant over many decades. I turn now to the functional and formal analyses of the warrior figures. The two brass warrior images produced in the lost-wax casting method (see Figs. 1 and 2) served as finials for war stan- dards. They are identical in size (both 28 cm high), as are the staffs for the standards (Fig. 8). The complete piece in Berlin measured 238 cm (see Fig. 2), the one in Foumban is 231 cm high (see Fig. 1). The staff of the Berlin standard was embroidered with glass beads stitched onto cloth, while the Foumban piece either was never covered with embroidery or, more likely, has lost its bead cover. The actual cloth flag also fell off. The leather strips used to fasten it are still visible at the top part of the staff. The Berlin standard was collected by the ethnographer of the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Bernhard Ankermann, during his stay in the Cameroon Grass- fields from October 1908 to May 1909. Ankermann was a reliable observer and took meticulous notes on the objects he acquired. He mentions the standard in one of the two papers he published on his fieldwork. He writes: "There is also a war standard from Bamum in my collec- tion, whose staff has on its tip the roughly thirty-centimeter-high cast fig- ure of a warrior with a sword and a cut-off human head in its hands."2' His catalogue entry is more specific: KUPID War standard from Ba- mum. Totally covered with bead embroidery (black, blue, white, red). A long iron shoe at the lower end [meaning a socketed iron tip to ram the standard into the ground]. Flag blue white red, in the white field and embroidered inscription: Nzo ya mfon Pamom = Nzoya King of Bamum. On the upper tip a cast brass figure of a warrior, in the right hand a sword, in the left a cut-off head, under the left arm a bead embroidered scabbard. Ankermann gave no translation of the term kupid. It translates as spear/lance (ku) of war (pit). Subsequently, Eckart von Sydow embellished Ankermann's information when he published the pho- tograph of the finial in 1923 and described it as a "chief's" figure on a war standard of the Bamum (Cameroon Grassfields).22 Little is known about the use and history of these standards beyond the information given by courtiers in Bamum that they were displayed during festivals. Whether the warriors actually carried them along during campaigns can be reconstructed from neither Bamum testimony nor German written or pictorial sources. In fact, the exis- tence of such standards in Bamum seems to be rather unusual, since only one other Grassfields state where such standards were common is known. Ankermann saw a white flag in Bali, when he stayed there in 1908-9, which was taken to war.23 The Bali term for the standard-tetuan-allows some further conclusion about the history and intro- duction of flags. There are three more standards without finials in the Bamum Palace Museum in Foumban, which are referred to by the Bamum as tutuwen, a Summer 1988 107</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 9 Head of a war gong, late nineteenth or early twentieth century, brass and cloth, h. c. 13 cm, Bamum, Cameroon. Foumban Bamum Palace Museum. term that clearly is related to the Bali word. Both terms derive from the Hausa word tuta ("flag").24 As the Hausa term suggests, the introduction of standards was very likely stimulated by Islamic and later probably by German exam- ples. At the same time, however, there existed an older tradition of prestige staffs.25 The two standards with the war- rior figure finials seem to combine both traditions. S tylistically, the finials of the stan- dards in Berlin and in the Palace Museum follow the conventions of the Bamum palace style as formulated dur- ing the nineteenth century. The Foum- ban figure (see Fig. 1) displays a trape- zoidal prestige headdress (mpelet), which is executed in an openwork fash- ion, achieved by crisscrossing wax threads. Similarly, the arms and legs of the figure as well as the socket are in openwork, a form of decoration com- monly used for lost-wax figures. The head of the figure is placed at an angle to the body, with the forehead and the headdress arranged perpendicularly. The face is round, with a flat nose that has a slightly defined bridge. The alae flare out. The open mouth protrudes from the lower portion of the face, with pointed teeth visible. Pointing teeth was a common form of embellishment, not only in Bamum but in many other areas of the Grassfields as well. Masks and anthropomorphic sculptures from most areas of the Grassfields display bare upper and lower rows of teeth, an artis- tic convention that is also repeated in the design of bead covers (see Fig. 4). The heads have almond-shaped, protruding eyes and well-defined lids and rounded eyebrows marked by small, parallel inci- sions. The semicircular disklike ears jut out laterally. The Berlin figure (see Fig. 2) bears a striking resemblance to the finial in the Palace Museum at Foumban. The con- figuration of the openwork circles of headdress seems to allude to embroi- dered high-status caps worn by the elite. Facial characteristics and the use of openwork on legs and socket are identi- cal with the Foumban piece. Both fig- ures hold trophy heads, which are gener- alized depictions of the enemy. The Foumban warrior carries a rather plainly executed head in both hands: when looking at the figure from the front, the head is the central element in the configuration. The Berlin figure holds a more elaborate head in the left hand. Its eyelids and eyebrows are hatched, its nose well defined. To judge from the photograph, which is all that remains of the Berlin piece, there is even an indication of a headdress. With his right hand the warrior raises a prestige sword in the typical Bamum configura- tion. A bead embroidered miniature scabbard suspended from a cloth sash has been added to the figure. The act of decapitation seems to be frozen in time. Both warrior figures are clearly by the hand of a Nguot artist who worked for the palace at the turn of the century or earlier. It may have been by nji Nkome himself, who had come to Mbuembue's court as a captive and had acquired high rank, but anyone of his successors as court artist could have been this master caster. They all took the nji title, and the name Nkome subse- quent to their investiture by the king. There was Nkome's successor Tanka, then Tapshe who followed him, and later, in the early years of this century, Gbetnkom, whose brother Nziankuo ascended to the nji-ship and is the nji Nkome mentioned by several research- ers.26 We can attribute other pieces to the same hand, such as a brass war gong (Fig. 9), which is an emblem of the tu panka, the head of the Bamum army. The head of the gong is an exquisite example of the palace style of brass casting by this representative of nji Nkome's school. The Nguot casters were equally accomplished carvers and produced many of the finest masks, sculptures, stools, and thrones for the palace. One of the Nguot carvers may well have been the creator of the spectacular two-figure thrones on whose footrests two beaded male figures represent the Bamum warriors as supreme fighters and guardians of the kingship (see Fig. 3).27 The crouching posture of the war- rior figures discussed here (see Figs. 4 and 5) alludes to the subservient pose of retainers when talking to the king. Simi- lar to the brass finials, the heads of the figures are tilted backward. Just as the enemies' heads are the focal point of the finials, the flintlock guns that the war- riors hold horizontally in front of their knees are the most striking aspect of these images. Guns became important in warfare after they had been introduced to Bamum around 1850. Although they were not very effective as weapons because they were difficult to aim accu- rately, they were intimidating: the pos- session of imported, highly valued guns instilled awe and conveyed prestige. 8 The bead cover of the warrior figures is strikingly colorful and rich in imag- ery. The embroiderers boldly combined light-blue, dark-blue, black, red, and white glass beads and applied cowries as trim. The glass beads mark facial char- acteristics and indicate elaborate dress and adornment.29 The faces have round eyes with heavy, arched eyebrows, pro- nounced nostrils, and open mouths with bare teeth. The dark glass beads under the chin represent a beard, indicating that the sculptures are to be understood as adult men. The warriors wear trape- zoidal, high-status headdresses (mpe- let), loincloths held by wide belts, neck- laces and bracelets, all reminiscent of the Bamum men's flamboyant attire worn to battle. Three icons add to the richness of the images. The convention- alized frog-toad icon (ntetuo) occurs on the headdresses of both figures. Black and white triangles cover the torso of Fig. 10 Headdress in crest form of the tu panka (see Fig. 6). 108Art Journal</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 11 Nyam Pare, tu panka under King Njoya, wearing his crest, and his first deputy with the bird crest, during their slow procession across the dancing field in front of the Bamum palace.

Bamum princes at the palace identified this icon as "four heads" (gbatu), their point of reference the configuration of a gyronny rather than that of the single triangle. A zigzag motif, the spear icon (nja'nku), covers the torso of the other warrior figure (see Fig. 4). The most lavish representation of the warrior theme is a headdress in crest form, which the tu panka wears during his installation ritual (Fig. 10). As men- tioned in the "Histoire" narrative quoted earlier, the institution of the panka had its origin in the retainers' saving King Mbuembue from certain death when he had fallen into a ditch. They formed a living barrier around Fig. 13 Tu panka Nyam Pare wearing his crest, leading the warriors in a slow procession, Foumban, Bamum, Cameroon, photographed 1912 by Rudolf Oldenburg (Museum fur Volkerkunde Wien, Oldenburg Collection no. 17467). him, and were thus named panka, the people (pa) of the barrier (nka). Tu panka, their head (tu), was an official elected by the king. The crest of the tu panka in the Bamum Palace Museum is 87 cm high, made from heavy wood, and covered with richly designed bead embroidery. Its Bamum designation is tu mola, literally the head (tu) of the child (mo) of the land (la). It should be noted in this context that la refers to land in the sense of the land of the fathers or the ancestors, whereas the word land in the sense of territory or state is ngu.30 The term tu connotes head in general, in the sense of leadership, and is also the generic word for crest. Tu mola, the head of the "child of the country," metaphorically alludes to the role of tu panka as the incarnation of the essence of the land. In pursuing the vocation of their forebears he and his army protect the land, and their mili- tancy renders it prosperous. The crest consists of two parts: the rider and the quadruped (see Fig. 6). Bamum nobles identified the animal as a leopard, which is borne out by its formal resemblance to other leopard images. An important factor in this interpretation is the checkerboard de- sign of the bead cover associated in Bamum with the pelt marks of the leop- ard. The size of the rider component overwhelms the beast in what Herbert Cole has referred to as ideological scal- ing typical for the equestrian theme in African sculpture.31 The rider crouches on top of the leopard, the lower part of his torso compressed. The feet on the Summer 1988 109</page><page sequence="8">leopard's back are well delineated and decorated with parallel rows of glass beads. This configuration creates the effect of a fusion of the body of the rider with that of the animal. The rider seems to be slightly bent forward, which, in combination with the positioning of the arms, gives the impression of movement. This representation of the rider sitting on top of the animal is unique in the Bamum repertoire and distinguishes the figure from other renditions of the equestrian theme in brass and terra- cotta.32 Although the bead cover does not permit an accurate analysis of the underlying carving, the figure displays the characteristics of the palace style of the second half of the nineteenth cen- tury, among them a slightly oval, elon- gated face. This suggests that it was created by one of the Nguot carvers during King Nsangu's reign (1860-86) or during the first years of King Njoya's reign. Accouterments in other mediums have been added to the sculpture. Two long strings of small, ringlike glass beads of African manufacture are wrap- ped around and attached to a brass neck ring. Small brass bells of European manufacture decorate their ends. Four bands of padded red fabric with little brass bells at the ends hang from the shoulders of the figure. A black feather tuft is fastened to the mpelet high-status headdress. The figure holds a spear in each hand. Judging by several photo- graphs taken of the crest in 1911-12, the brass neck ring and the bead and cloth bands with the small bells were always part of the sculpture, whereas the feather headdress was a later addition (Figs. 11, 12, and 13). The accouter- ments of the figure permit its identifica- tion as a representation of tu panka himself. The spears held in each hand clearly indicate the figure's association with war. More specifically, the brass ring alludes to the beaded stiff neck ring (katandu) that tu panka wears with his official uniform (Fig. 14). A black feather tuft is part of any warrior's outfit for battle and festive displays; the feathers used for the headdress of the tu panka and attached to the figure are those of the rare white-crested turaco (tauraco leucolophus).33 Several icons adorn the bead cover of the equestrian sculpture. The zigzag spear icon (nja'nku) covers the torso, and the "four heads" icon (gbatu) occurs on the headdress. Parallel rows of glass beads in different colors indicate the loincloth. There are remnants of cowrie trim on the edges. Cowries (mbiim) are commonly used in prestige contexts, and because they served as a standard of value in nineteenth-century Bamum, represent wealth. Finally, the checkerboard design on the animal re- creates the marks of the leopard pelt. ^M/ uch has been written and specu- lated about the meaning of Grass- fields icons in general and Bamum icons in particular.3 Most notable are animal icons, be they executed in sculptural form as the leopard of the crest or in two-dimensional design as the frog-toad motif on the warriors' headdresses. Grassfields arts abound with zoomor- phic configurations, an indication that animals occupy a significant space in Grassfields thought. Unfortunately, ani- mal symbolism in the Grassfields has not yet been explored in a systematic fashion. Yet one wonders whether the underlying principles do not resemble the complex conceptualization of the universe that Paula Ben-Amos has out- lined for Benin.35 Animals, constituting primordial metaphors par excellence, foster references to a number of dif- ferent domains. Benin cosmology as- signs all beings according to their nature and characteristics to specific spheres of geographical, existential, and temporal order. Their positions are phrased in hierarchical terms in a classificatory system resembling that of human soci- ety. Ultimately, according to Paula Ben- Amos, "the concept of the nature and defining characteristics of animals func- tions to establish the outer limits of humanity, that is, the non-human or uncivilised as well as the more-than- human or supernatural."36 That there is consistent order in the ranking of icons all over the Grass- fields-indicating the existence of an intricate classificatory system-has Fig. 14 Portrait of the present tu panka at the Bamum palace. Photographed 1984. been pointed out by Tamara Northern in the most insightful and comprehen- sive discussion of Grassfields icon- ography to date.37 In this system, humans, and therefore the anthropo- morphic icon, rank the highest, followed by leopard, serpent, and elephant, all of which are the royal referents. Leopard and elephant are metaphors and met- onyms for the king. The leopard's fierce- ness, ferocity, and leadership among the other animals are qualities analogous to those of a king, and the beauty of his pelt recalls the king in full regalia. The frog- toad icon refers to fertility, alluding on one level to the frog's frequent propaga- tion and on a deeper level to its associa- tion with wetness and resiliency. As Michael Rowlands points out in his analysis of Grassfields material symbol- ism, moisture and suppleness have female connotation,38 and fecundity is the very essence of femaleness. The "four heads" icon is particular to the Bamum iconographical repertoire and was mentioned as early as 1908. In other areas of the Grassfields, this arrange- ment of triangles has been interpreted as yet another rendering of leopard spots. The Bamum I consulted clearly per- ceived it as a configuration in the form of a gyronny. They saw the triangles as "heads," and regarded them as a human referent.39 The spear icon draws on dif- ferent sets of classifications, those of mediums and objects. The spear alludes directly to warfare. Iron as the most common medium used for spear tips has a connotation of aggressiveness and power in Bamum, and in the "Histoire" occurs as a metaphor for war as such. When Mbuembue came to power, according to the authors of this chroni- cle, his first words were that he would set the borders of the kingdom with blood and black iron.40 The equestrian crest was displayed during the installation of the tu panka. Although the office of the tu panka lost its significance when warfare came to an end with the arrival of the Germans, it was maintained as a cere- monial function at the court. Regular investitures still took place during King Njoya's reign. No visitors to Njoya's court, however, has ever reported an installation of the tu panka, and the "Histoire" does not provide a descrip- tion. The only early documents (Jan- uary 1912) are several photographs of the perambulation of the tu panka and the warriors across the dancing field in front of the palace (see Figs. 11, 12, and 13).41 Among recent sources on the installation of a tu panka are the oral accounts of old Bamum who have wit- nessed the event. In 1968, Claude Tar- 110Art Journal</page><page sequence="9">dits, an anthropologist, saw one of the sporadic reinvestitures of the present tu panka, but it is not clear whether the procession followed the sequence of ear- lier times.42 In fact, the early photo- graphs indicate that there were varia- tions as to the position of the main actors in the procession. At the turn of the century the tu panka and his deputies were chosen by the king from among the palace retain- ers or the large servant corps. The most important criteria for the selection of the tu panka were his loyalty and mili- tary prowess. In fact, the king could install any courageous man who was not a member of the royal patrilineage. The tu panka served a three-year term, after which he was amply rewarded by the sovereign. The investiture of the tu panka follows the typical triadic struc- ture of rites of passage, namely the phases of separation, margin, and aggre- gation.43 During an initial ceremony in the palace, the monarch gave the tu panka the emblems of his office, among them the stiff, beaded neck ring, a large leopard-skin bag with a buffalo drinking horn for sacrificial purposes, a fly whisk, and his weapons. Then the king touched him lightly with a spear, the symbol of warfare. This initial phase of the ritual ended with the tu panka's going to the quarters assigned to the tu panka in the palace. Here he changed into the ritual garment that the king had ordered for this special occasion, a gown with a veiling hood and with medicine pouches, amulets, and bells attached to it (see Fig. 12). Round cowrie ornaments stitched onto the gown alluded to wealth. The warriors began their procession across the large festival site in front of the palace and the market area. Accord- ing to Tardits, a warrior with a shoul- dered spear bundle walked at the head of the single-file procession. This war- rior was followed by the first deputy of the tu panka, who wore a bird crest, which the Bamum designated as the image of a hawk, a bird of swiftness and aggression, and therefore a reference to warfare. Then followed the new tu panka himself. In the procession that took place in late 1911 or early 1912, however, a long line of warriors pre- ceded the tu panka (see Fig. 11). The tu panka was veiled and with his left hand secured the tu mola crest towering over him. Over his left shoulder he carried a sword suspended from a sash and in his right hand an iron staff with rattles. Each time he took a st hehe hit the ground with it. He was followed by a line of six more veiled warriors and another hundred warriors in their military attire after them. At the sides of the tu panka were two warriors who hit their swords with pieces of bamboo and chanted: Tu panka! Where is the king? The king is in the palace. oooooo! Here is a thing that has come from Rifum [the mythical place of ori- gin of the Bamum]. Who has defeated the foreign kings? Tu panka! Where is the king? He is at home. Attention today! Attention today! Something dangerous has come out of the palace!44 During the solemn procession, the tu panka and the warriors were greeted by a crowd of onlookers, and then the men slowly regained the palace. The future tu panka now entered into the liminal phase of the ritual: the week- long seclusion in his house in the palace district. Attended there by his deputies and servants and surrounded by former holders of this office, he was instructed about the medicinal and ritual aspects of warfare. He was veiled when receiving visitors and sat on a high bed so that his feet did not touch the ground, indicating his complete removal from his former life and everyday activities. At the end of the period of seclusion, the procession around the festival site and market square was repeated. Here Tardits's text is not quite clear as to whether the tu panka wears the headcrest again. In any event, he now divested himself of the veiling garment and began his duties. The public part of the performance affected the audience, who were ordi- nary Bamum and members of the subju- gated peoples. By wearing the headcrest over his veiled face, tu panka was visually transformed into the timeless, ideal warrior, a role that he would take on for the next three years. The crest, the warrior incarnated, was elevated and elevated him above all other war- riors. Elevation here becomes a meta- phor for high rank and prestige. In addi- tion, the display of riches and the dignity of the slow and deliberate movements of the warriors created an immediate visual effect. The sounds of the swords' being hit and the chant of the warriors accoustically marked the transforma- tion of tu panka. Besides, the overall design of the procession visually and accoustically presented and enacted the elaborateness and awesomeness of Ba- mum military might. The response of the audience to the statement made by the tu mola and by the long rows of impressively adorned warriors is crucial to interpreting its meaning. Eliciting a calculated response of awe and admira- tion was part of the warrior figure's function when it was brought out of the palace. As the most exalted warrior repre- sentation from Bamum, the tu mola gives superb form to the essence of all the warrior images discussed here. The message and meaning of these fig- ures derive from collapsing into one statement experiences drawn from sev- eral classificatory realms. The naturalis- tic configuration and the attention to detail in all figures make them easily "readable" to the spectators, many of whom were members of subdued popu- lations. The beaded warrior figures hold spears and elaborate guns, and the brass figures display the trophy heads. They make direct association to the modes of Bamum warfare and fighting and allude to the meaning of the trophy head as a man's symbolic nourishment, as inti- mated in King Mbuembue's narrative.45 Killing and taking trophies is the ulti- mate prerogative of the powerful. Besides these direct associations brought forth by the form as such, there are more subtle allusions to the military prowess and the power of the Bamum, which can be understood only through indigenous conceptualizations. The icons-the leopard, the frog-toad, the "four heads," and the spear-are imbued with meaning derived from the role that their referents occupy in Bamum world view. Although the fig- ures' primary meaning pertains to war- fare, other principles are manifested as well, such as royal power (leopard) and productivity associated with war and with fecundity (frog-toad). The me- diums displayed in the warrior figures are associated with wealth and the eco- nomic control of the Bamum elite. They hold an elevated position in the hierar- chy of materials. Imported glass beads, cowries as a standard of value, and highly esteemed acquisitions, such as the European-made bells, are accumu- lated in these images. The connotations of brass used for the two finials hinge not only on its rarity and exclusivity but also on its red shine. The Bamum term for brass-lam piutui, "red iron"- stresses this particular quality of the medium, since the colo red is a multiva- lent referent occurring in power contexts and in ritual.46 The warrior figures allude to histori- cal experiences and Bamum concepts of history. As the product of artists from subdued populations, they are a con- stant reminder of the process of subju- gation. At the same time they express Summer 1988111</page><page sequence="10">forms of integration, because these art- ists have risen to high rank within the palace organization and now work for the palace. Their creation provides a charter in aesthetic terms of the con- quest and absorption of numerous chief- doms into the Bamum kingdom. In his essay on accumulative sculpture in Africa, Arnold Rubin stated that intentional design redundancy, the mul- tiplication of mediums in, for example, the context of power, is a means of stimulating and organizing a wide vari- ety of calculated responses.47 Clearly, this observation applies to the warrior figures. Design redundancy, as used by Rubin, refers mainly to form and medium, but it seems that the notion can be expanded to a more general principle underlying the warrior sculptures. An exalted statement of Bamum political, economic, and psychological power is created by drawing on many domains, be they form, iconography, medium, or historic allusion. Collapsing references to all of them into these images intensi- fies their ideological message. As a result, the impact of the warrior figures goes beyond expression or reflection of ideology. They become affective tools in the persuasive effort of the Bamum elite to promulgate political, historical, and ideological concepts and impress these concepts upon the audience. The interpretation of formal, icono- graphic, functional, historic, and sym- bolic evidence has brought forth multi- ple insights into the meaning of the warrior figures from Bamum. This anal- ysis required the combination of dif- ferent methodologies and theoretical approaches formulated in art history, anthropology, and history. While there is always the inherent danger of superfi- ciality and dilletantism when crossing disciplinary boundaries, the synthesis of insights leads to the construction of a whole ultimately larger than its parts. Clearly, a multidisciplinary approach provides a very feasible avenue for iconological studies on African art. Notes 1 The Bamum kingdom is located in the Western Province of the Republic of Cameroon. It is one of the southernmost outposts of Islam in Cam- eroon, because the Bamum king and the elite converted to Islam shortly after the turn of the century. Islamic iconoclasm has never taken hold in Bamum, however. Research for this paper was carried out during several stays in Bamum. The longest one lasted from January to June 1977 in connection with a cultural-aid project sponsored by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It served the cataloguing and analysis of the objects in the Bamum Palace Museum. My thanks go in particular to His Royal Highness Sultan Seidou Njimoluh Njoya of Foumban, to His Excellency Dr. Adamou Ndam Njoya, and to Prince Nji Yerima Jean, who assisted with the work. Fur- ther research was carried out in numerous archives and museums in Europe. I am indebted to all colleagues at these archives and museums for their friendly support. 2 Arnold Rubin, African Accumulative Sculp- ture: Power and Display, New York, 1974, pp. 6,7. 3 African Art and Leadership, ed., Douglas Fraser and Herbert Cole, Madison, WI, 1972. 4 Mary Douglas, Implicit Meanings: Essays in Anthropology, London, 1975; Victor Turner, The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual, Ithaca, NY, and London, 1967; idem, The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Struc- ture, Ithaca, NY, and London, 1977. 5 Among scholars studying art, Paula Ben-Amos has most rigorously pursued the notion of indi- genous classification and symbolic systems in an exemplary fashion; e.g., Paula Ben-Amos, "Men and Animals in Benin Art," Man (N.S.), 11 (1976), pp. 243-52. 6 Jan Vansina, Art History in Africa, London and New York, 1984. Unfortunately, weak historical methodology by art historians and anthropologists alike often leads to the eclectic use of bits and pieces of information that might fit particular hypotheses. This point has been very well taken by Sidney Littlefield Kasfir; see: "One Tribe, one Style? Paradigms in the Historiography of African Art," History in Africa, 11 (1984), pp. 163-93, esp. pp. 165-67. Considering that Africanist art historians and anthropologists often collect data in areas where historians have not worked before, they should have a heightened awareness of the far-reaching implications of their work for African history in general. 7 See, for example: Tamara Northern, The Art of Cameroon, exh. cat., Washington D.C., Smithsonian Institution, 1984, pp. 99-100; Pierre Harter, Arts Anciens du Cameroun, Arnouville (France), 1986, pp. 161-63. 8 I am using "brass" as a general term for any copper alloy, because the composition of the alloys has not been analyzed. 9 Idrissou Mborou Njoya, Histoire et Coutumes des Bamum, traduction du pasteur Henri Mar- tin, M6moires de 1'I.F.A.N., Serie Populations no. 5, 1952, Dakar. King Njoya ruled the Bamum kingdom from c. 1886 and remained firmly in control throughout the German colo- nial period which ended in 1915. With the arrival of the French he fell into disgrace and was officially removed from kingship in 1924. He spent the next few years in self-chosen exile in one of his country estates. In 1930, the rift between the French administration and Njoya came to a climax, and the French decided to exile him in Yaound6. He died there in 1933. Several versions of the Bamum history were compiled during the second half of his reign. The missionary Henri Martin later translated one of these into French. Although the transla- tion is annotated, a complete interpretation can only be carried out with the help of Bamum assistants. While in Foumban, I discussed most parts of the "Histoire" with Prince Nji Yerima Jean. 10 The classic example is the verbal portrait of King Mbuembue, a ruler of the first half of the nineteenth century, who personifies the charis- matic warrior king. In the narrative, his mili- tary vigor is transposed into an idealized description of his appearance in terms of strength and flamboyance; see: Njoya (cited n. 9), p. 30. A translation of the passage can be found in Christraud M. Geary, The Idiom of War in the Bamum Court Arts, African Stud- ies Center Working Papers, no. 51, Boston University, 1981, p. 6. Kings who did not live up to the ideal of strong leadership are dis- missed in the "Histoire" with brief statements like the following: "Ngapna succeeded Mo Nguu, but did not do anything. He lived off what the hands of Nshare [the founder king of Bamum] had done." Njoya (cited n. 9), p. 25; translated from the French. 11 Njoya (cited n. 9), p. 52. 12 The phonetic transcription used in the "His- toire" has been simplified for the purpose of this paper. 13 Njoya (cited n. 9), pp. 46-47; translated by the author. 14 Geary (cited n. 10), pp. 8-11. 15 Martin Gohring, "Erste Eindriicke in Ba- mum," May 13, 1906, Archives of the Basel Mission, Kamerun E-2. 22, item 279, p. 18. 16 Richard Roberts has presented a study on warfare as a production mode and convincingly argues that warfare can understood as a form of social reproduction; see: "Production and Reproduction of Warrior States: Segu Bam- bara and Segu Tokolor c. 1712-1890," The International Journal of African Historical Studies 13: 3 (1980), pp. 389-419. 17 At the turn of the century, as a result of Mbuembue's earlier exploits, Bamum com- prised 70,000 inhabitants and encompassed a territory of 7,000 to 8,000 square kilometers.

I am grateful for this crucial 112 Art Journal</page><page sequence="11">information, which makes clear that there were several prominent casters and sculptors in this lineage. One of nji Nkome's successors, Nzia- nkuo, made a name for himself as a caster and carver during King Njoya's reign. He had inherited the title nji and was consequently known as nji Nkome upon succession. Fu sie (also spelled Mfunsie), another prominent carver at Njoya's time, was Nziankuo's father's brother's son. 21 Bernhard Ankermann, "Bericht uiber eine eth- nographische Forschungsreise ins Grasland von Kamerun," Zeitschrift fuir Ethnologie, 42 (1910), pp. 288-310, see: p. 307; translated by the author. 22 Eckart von Sydow, Die Kunst der Naturvblker und der Vorzeit, Propylaen Kunstgeschichte 1, Berlin, 1923, photograph p. 114, text p. 496. Von Sydow's interpretation of the figure as a "chief" is a typical example of how the very accurate and careful annotation of a researcher who has spent almost two years in the field is later embellished or even falsified. Recently, this piece has been mentioned by Harter (cited n. 7), p. 140, who erroneously describes it as a handle of a war gong and as a present of King Njoya to the German emperor. 23 Hermann Baumann and Lazlo Vajda, "Bern- hard Ankermanns volkerkundliche Aufzeich- nungen im Grasland von Kamerun 1907- 1909," Baessler Archiv N.F., 7: 2 (1959), pp. 217-317; p. 238. 24 Geary 1983 (cited n. 19), pp. 203-4. 25 Ibid., pp. 171-72. 26 Paul Gebauer, Art of Cameroon, exh. cat., Portland (OR) Art Museum, 1979, p. 121; Harter (cited n. 7), pp. 163, 165, 172. 27 One of the thrones is in the Bamum Palace Museum, an almost identical one in the Museum fur Volkerkunde at Berlin.

The images were taken by Franz Thorbecke, a geographer on a research expedition in Cam- eroon, and his photographer wife, Marie-Pau- line, who had taken up residence in Foumban. Also present was Rudolf Oldenburg, an Aus- trian merchant who lived in the German gov- ernmental and agricultural post Kutie some twenty miles southeast of Foumban.
