<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECOLOGY, JUSTICE, AND CHRISTIAN FAITH: COMMENTS OF A COMMA CONSULTANT Joan Gibb Engel / Shirely Heinze Environmental Fund his year saw the publication by Greenwood Press of Ecology, Justice, A and Christian Faith: A Critical Guide to the Literature, edited by Peter W. Bakken, Joan Gibb Engel, and J. Ronald Engel. This bibliography has as its normative center the concept of eco-justice?a moral claim that ecology and justice belong together and that human beings must simultaneously seek the ecologically fitting and the socially just. The eco-justice concept is one that could have been pursued without reference to a particular faith tradition or across many traditions; in this case the editors chose to review only that literature which also met a criterion of attention to Christian theology, ethics, institutions, or public witness. Hence the bibliography is a guide to the re sponse within Christianity to the deepening perception of environmental crisis and the adjustments to theology, practice, and self-understanding such perception has evoked. A critical survey of the Christian eco-justice movement, the first part of the bibliography examines paths in the emergence and spread of eco-justice thinking. It documents the movement's trends toward increasing pluralism and theological intensification as well as the fragmentations of Christian faith the movement has occasioned and the conflicting points of view among its ad herents. It locates the various contextual studies that serve as background to the eco-justice movement, including the roles played by the social and natural sciences, theology and philosophy, environmental philosophy and ethics, biblical studies, and the body of scholarship devoted to examining the historical development of the social teachings of the Christian churches and the relationship of these to environmental attitudes. Most importantly, the critical survey examines the concept of eco-justice?its social justice values, its ecological values, and the factors hindering and fostering its full expres sion. Significant concern for eco-justice blossomed in a relatively short period, and the second section annotates a literature that burgeoned between the years of 1961 and 1993. The five hundred-plus books, articles, and essays were selected because they address the relationship of ecology, justice, and 21</page><page sequence="2">22_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ Christian faith, not because they present a particular view of what that relationship should be. Consequently, they represent a full range of doctrinal and theological positions, draw on Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox traditions, and embrace foundationalist, hermeneutical, creation centered, liberationist, feminist, eco-feminist, theocentric, anthropocentric, biocentric, evangelical, and process perspectives. They consider a range of contemporary social and environmental issues, including global and national inequities, poverty, hunger, war, sexism, racism, and the loss of biological and cultural diversity. Work on the bibliography began in 1985 and proceeded, with pauses occasioned by the press of other work, for a decade. I joined Peter and Ron on the project in 1992, at which time we perceived the annotations to be nearing completion, and my role to be primarily that of editor. I should mention that I am neither a theologian nor a philosopher, my background of experience having been in the fields of biological science and nature writing. I saw myself continuing with those interests while consulting on such mundane details as the proper placement of commas. The surge of eco-justice literature that was being written and discovered at that point, however, forced a recasting of my role, with the result that I had the enriching experience of reading and annotating a great many works of Christian theology that address our relationship to the natural and eternal worlds and to one another. Since such concerns have also motivated the finest nature writers, I was not in entirely new territory, nor was I able to totally divorce my former interests from the job at hand. I would like therefore to make a few observations about patterns in Ecology, Justice, and Christian Faith having to do with nature. I will do so with an eye to the commas that did eventually come to occupy my full attention. I. Comma comes from kop/tein, "a piece cut off," referring to the phrase so marked. A comma makes a piece of a sentence stand slightly apart?but not disconnected from the whole as it is following a semicolon or a period. A comma is really an equalizer. Things do not all flow together with commas; between commas ideas are on an equal footing. I see the eco-justice discourse</page><page sequence="3">_Vol. 18, No. 1? January 1997_23 needing a few well-placed commas. Generally speaking, nature is not on an equal footing with theology or social concerns in our literature. Let me illustrate with a quote from Don Cuppitt. His paper entitled "Nature and Culture" is under the heading "Historical and Cultural Studies." Cuppitt writes, "in our lifetime Culture and Nature, the tame and the wild, have become confused and impossible any longer to distinguish from one another." In the old view, he contends, nature was "the Other," but now our concept of the environment has shifted from Plato to Hegel to embrace a "new vision of the world as a boundless immanently evolving whole in which we are fully immersed and which has no outside." In this new vision "one may view the self not as a substance but as a communications centre."1 Cuppitt, if I understand him correctly, welcomes this new state of affairs, and while his views may not typify eco-justice literature, they do indicate the direction of a significant segment. I suggest that this discourse needs to put back the commas between culture and nature?seeing nature again as Other (and also, lest Cuppitt be right about the self, seeing the self as substance, before we all become the computers and cordless phones we adulate). The danger is the old anthropomorphic one in new guise. For, just as in Hegel's Phenomenology absolute knowledge turns out to be Hegel himself sitting there smoking his pipe, so, similarly, Emerson at one time envisioned man "out of whom sprang the sun and moon" as "having filled nature with his currents," so that the sage of Concord could make the incredible statement: "as fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind ... so fast will disagreeable appearances, swine, spiders, snakes, pests, mad-houses, prisons, enemies, vanish."2 Without an Other we risk making everything mind, or writing, or e-mail. The foundation of eco-justice, a belief that concern for social justice and concern for nature's renewal belong together, seems to imply a move away from anthropomorphism. If anything, its recognition of the embeddedness of humans in the natural world poses the threat of human invisibility, though it 1 Don Cuppitt, "Nature and Culture," in Humanity, Environment, and God, ed.

Furguson (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, Belknap Press, 1979), 45.</page><page sequence="4">24_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ need not mean a loss of identity on either side. But the human/nature relationship in our literature is frequently described (and please note that there are countervailing views to this as to each of my observations) not with equalizing commas between humans and other species and orders, but such that humans embrace all creation. Here, for instance, is Claude Stewart writing in Cry of the Environment. After admitting that "the failure to appreciate the uniqueness and value of the extra-human dimension of creation is tragic," he adds: but equally tragic would be the misanthropic attitude which failed to see that all creation finds a certain "summing up" and completion in that sector of creation that has become conscious of itself and its companions.3 The inclusion of ecology in theology should discourage human preening. Instead, our eco-justice literature foregrounds human consciousness to the extent of making it the telos of all life. Such a perception is unlikely to create respect for the myriad other creatures that sustain us. As important as it is, human consciousness cannot make oxygen or food or water, cannot con vert gaseous nitrogen to protein, and has a terrible time dealing with dead organic matter. But one does not read about all creation finding a "summing up" in maggots. II. Still, our eco-justice literature much better represents ecological systems than it does "nature" understood as the phenomenon one encounters on walking outdoors in a park, by a seashore, on a mountaintop, the phenomenon experienced in smelling flowers, or entering a grove of trees. I did a computer search of the bibliography. The word "plant" appeared eight times, including one nuclear power plant; "tree" came up twice, "bird" once. There were no flowers. Grass appeared in "grassroots " In part this represents the whole 3 Claude Y.

Jesus' "consider the lilies of the field," for example, is fre quently quoted in the literature but never showed up in an annotation. Nevertheless, from this literature one would think nature consisted of some thing called creation, which is good, and some things called acid rain, pol lution, ozone depletion, and rainforest destruction, which are bad. And humans. We have a plot but few characters. Not only is nature often slighted in this literature, but on occasion nature writers are also. Paul Santmire has recently written: The message of Waiden may speak to an elite, largely affluent few. What does it have to say to the impoverished urban masses around this globe, who must struggle every day for their bread, often against overwhelming odds?4 Within Waiden itself there is refutation in the lines: "The luxury of one class is counterbalanced by the indigence of another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are the almshouse and 'silent poor.'"5 Indeed, Santmire's seems a most peculiar attack on one whose writing inspired the British Labor Movement, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King. Perhaps it only goes to show that the hurts that eco-justice set about to heal run deep. Often eco-justice books contain lists of what churches can do for the environment. Seldom do they include: learn the names of your local wild flowers, learn what watershed you live in. Yet if restoration of the environ ment is a goal, knowledge of it is a very elemental step. Environment pre sents itself in settings, pieces cut off from one another by their particularity, although never fully disconnected. There were exceptions to my survey. Gary Comstock's "Pigs and Piety," an argument for vegetarianism, relates a personal story in which setting is important. Comstock starts off, "In Story County, Iowa, where I live ..." 4 H.

Lyndon Shanley (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1971), 34.</page><page sequence="6">26_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ He goes on to describe the way farming is done in Story County, how it revolves around the rearing and selling of livestock, and how, though it is "sustainable, ecologically balanced, and consistent with principles of Christian stewardship," it is nevertheless, in his opinion, morally indefensible.6 In another example, Carol Robb traces the ownership and loss of her family's farm in southeastern Kansas to argue for land reform in the United States.7 In both of these articles, the specificity of place contributes to the argument. An important bonus of place is what it does for ritual. Because of Story County we understand that barbecues may be an inadequate ritual to express community. When Sean McDonagh points out that in the Philippines wheat is not grown and thus the eating of bread is associated exclusively with wealth, we understand that place is a factor in the Last Supper, and bread may not be the element of choice to express the communion of all believers.8 III. Isee a need to add commas to eco-justice literature in the form, not only of specific places, but also of specific creatures and creature types. Another component of Comstock's essay is the attempt to see the world through eyes other than human?in this case through a pig's eye. At one point we read (Comstock is quoting William Hedgepeth), "Probe, poke, trot, root. Ah, Hogs! They have unquenchably inquiring minds, each with a vast capacity for sustained wonder."9 This device of personification is not without its draw backs. It tends to go against seeing nature as Other and sometimes fosters a skewed over-valuing of humanlike characteristics. On the other hand, Lawrence Buell says of the personification of nature that this historically important element of nature writing involved "an incipient ecocentric ethics 6 Gary Comstock, 'Tigs and Piety: A Theocentric Perspective in Food Animals," in Good News for Animals?

Jay McDaniel tells of howling like a wolf at a Paul Winter concert. He explains that Winter wanted the participants to become wolves in their imaginations, "communally and as a religious rite." The act of howling made McDaniel feel that it was "spiritually important" to affirm wolves, even though he found it hard to do so in Christianity as it is practiced.12 In relating this experience, McDaniel helps the reader remember that there are other ways of knowing, as well as other lives that exist far from office and computer, artificial light, and warm feet, and so helps bolster his argument for a less human-centered religion. ven with the use of this device, however, there seems to be a tendency in X?/eco-justice literature to rush in with the interpretative lens of Christian symbols and categories, to sidestep a full-bodied philosophy of nature. Often when nature is not slighted, it is, without reflection, lumped together as a good worth preserving. For instance, McDaniel quotes Schubert Ogden's "because God's love is subject to no bounds and excludes nothing from its em brace,there is no creature's interest that is not also God's interest and, IV. 10 Lawrence Buell, The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, Belknap Press, 1995), 199. 11 Herman Melville, Moby-Dick, Norton Critical Edition, 326. Melville provides this piece of information in a footnote to which he also adds, "When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more hominum^ 12 Jay B.

But there's one creature that sneaks in to undermine the text: the AIDS virus. Are the interests of the AIDS virus God's interests also? Perhaps a virus is too close to inorganic matter for this question to be taken seriously except by homo phobes. What about tsetse flies, baby-bird-devouring ants, wasps that lay their eggs in butterfly larva? Annie Dilliard, describing a frog being sucked dry by a giant water bug, asks if the water bug was created in jest or in earnest.14 That all of nature is included in God's love is not a meaningful statement unless it deals with this problem; rather it sounds like a form of self-hypnosis, another version of Emerson's "as fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind... so fast will disagreeable appearances, swine, spiders, snakes, pests, mad-houses, prisons, enemies, vanish." I, too, resonate to Ogden's statement. Yet I see the value of attending to the viewpoint of Holmes Rolston who asserts that "nature is 'red in tooth and claw,' fierce and indifferent, a scene of hunger, disease, death. And nature is what it is regardless of human moral fallings, indeed regardless of humans at all."15 13 Ibid., 87. 14 Annie Dilliard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek (New York: Harper and Row, 1974), 7. 15 Holmes Rolston , "Does Nature Need to Be Redeemed?" Horizons in Biblical Theology 14:2 (1993): 143. Note that Rolston would insert not a comma but a period between human morality and animal pr?dation.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 18, No. 1, January 1997 29 V. Let me mention briefly two other places where commas exist beneath the text and need to be acknowledged. Both of these come about because eco justice is a brave attempt to bridge disciplines. My point is not that such bridging is a bad idea, as that well-constructed bridges have yet to be built. First, eco-theology is not the language of ecology. The two disciplines do not merge with the addition of a hyphen. Belief based on faith is not generally counted as proof in the secular scientific world. The vocabulary of Christian faith is puzzling to the scientist, in some places less so than in others. Consider these two approaches to death, the first from J?rgen Moltmann: The final renewal of the whole creation goes far beyond the day-to-day sustaining of creation. Through it, not merely destruction but also destructibility, not merely death from human violence but also the mortality of creatures is over come. The fundamental conditions of the present creation are transformed. Creation is freed from the power of time for the presence of eternity and from the dominion of death for eternal life. Creation, which is menaced everywhere by chaos and annihilation, finds an absolute haven in the eternal love of God.16 The second quote is from Rosemary Ruether: [In death] all the component parts of matter/energy that coalesced to make up our individuated self are not lost. Rather, they change their form and become food for new beings to arise from our bones. To bury ourselves in steel coffins, so that we cannot disintegrate into the earth, is to refuse to accept this process of entering back into the matrix of renewed life. Such a manner of burial represents a funda mental refusal to accept earth as our home and the plants and 16 J?rgen Moltmann, "The Scope of Renewal in the Spirit," Ecumenical Review 42 (April 1990): 104.</page><page sequence="10">30_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ animals of earth as our kindred. In this way we also fail to recognize the redemptive nature of our own disintegra tion-reintegration back into the soil.17 Ruether's approach would find acceptance in the secular-scientific world, yet it risks a lack of validation within Christianity, a fact Ruether seems to recognize as she begins to translate her notions into Christian language of redemption. Rolston's "Does Nature Need to Be Redeemed?" is an exercise in translation between biologist and theologian, where theology's "sin" is bio logy's "innate selfishness," theology's "redemption," biology's "regenera tion," where "redeemed" becomes "conserved." Such attempts help, but the bridge is still shaky, for they cannot eradicate the divisiveness that the serious inclusion of nature brings to philosophical and social theology. Once cre ation's value is affirmed, the disturbing idea that there might be an end to nature (a positive apocalypse if matter be worthless) is doubly disturbing in that it indicates an inability of God to act on behalf of creation. In a world of created beings deemed good, the fact of species extinction strikes at the foundations of justice. It is a slaughter of the innocents on a grand scale. It is not just the end of individual creatures through death, it is the end of particularity itself. One must either revision God, reaffirm a two-kingdom approach, or downplay apocalyptic rhetoric, each of which our literature illustrates. (Attempts to reconceive God include McDaniel's God understood as an organism, Sallie McFague's Earth conceived as God's body, and Matthew Fox's Mother Earth conceived as Jesus Christ crucified, resurrected, and ascended.18) 17 Rosemary Radford Ruether, Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology (Boston: Beacon Press, 1993), 258. 18 Jay B.

So I see a need to add commas, to chop off pieces of eco-justice discourse and reposition them on more solid footings, to better distinguish parts. I would like to conclude with a note from a patriarch of nature writing whose work supports the full inclusion of nature in eco-justice discourse. At the end of "Slavery in Massachusetts," written in 1854, we come across a jarring juxtaposition. Thoreau seems somewhat unhinged in this essay (or more unhinged than usual, as his detractors would say). Angry at Massachusetts's capture and return of an escaped slave, he talks of blowing up the system of government; he says he is dwelling "wholly within hell," and his thoughts "are murder to the State." Then this: "But it chanced the other day that I scented a white water-lily, and a season I had waited for had arrived."19 To many, it seems as if Thoreau has pulled a cop-out, retreated to the safety of his pond, away from harsh political/social/economic reality?a perception similar to that of social justice advocates when environment began to rival justice as a concern within the churches. But it was Thoreau's greatness to see that nature cannot rightly be separated either from ultimate meaning nor from just action. The white water-lily belongs in the picture and the recognition of that fact is essential to human fulfillment: If nature can compound this fragrance still annually, I shall believe her still young and full of vigor, her integrity and genius unimpaired, and that there is virtue even in man, too, who is fitted to perceive and love it.20 Integrity, the integrity of creation, implies both separation and inclu sion?commas but no period. 19 Thoreau, "Slavery in Massachusetts," in Reform Papers, ed. Wendell Glick (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 108. 20 Ibid.</page></plain_text>
