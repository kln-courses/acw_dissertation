<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Abstract This paper deals with Angus Kerr-Lawson’s  interpretation of George Santayana’s phi- losophy of values. I claim that Kerr-Lawson  reads Santayana correctly; however, as re- gards axiology, he reads Santayana literally  Angus Kerr- and misses Santayana’s engagement with it.  Santayana’s engagement with the philoso- Lawson, phy of values is clearly seen when we use  axiological terms and problematics in ap- Abulensean proaching his thought.

I could  Krzysztof (Chris) Piotr even claim that although it lacked an elabo- Skowronski rated theoretical methodology and system- atic argumentation, the problem of values  was one of the main issues at philosophy’s  very beginning, when it emerged in An- cient Greece. Thus, one can say that the Py- thagoreans formulated the idea of objective  values by claiming values are independent  of agents’ opinions and individuals’ predi- lections, and that values can be discovered  rather than created. Be it noted that the  Pythagorean understanding of the objective  value of beauty (that is one that is founded  upon regularity, proportion, harmony, and  symmetry) was, with important modifi ca- tions throughout the ages, probably the  most lasting idea in European aesthetics.  Very soon after the Pythagoreans, the de- bate between Plato and the Sophists showed  the clash between followers of absolute val- ues on the one hand, and of relative values,  on the other. In other words, the debate was   TRANSACTIONS OF THE CHARLES S. PEIRCE SOCIETY Vol. 45, No. 4 ©2009 532 </page> <page sequence="2"> whether values are unchangeable and eternally fixed or whether they  are changeable and in temporal relations to various factors, most of  all, social practice. More or less at the same time, Socrates discounted  Anaxagoras’ vision of what is important in philosophy (and in science)  and what is not, and searched for what is good, beautiful, and true  in the world of human action rather than non-human (that is cosmic)  rules.2 Socrates was also the thinker who wanted to set wisdom along  with happiness and the noble life as the sensible aim(s) to be pursued  and achieved, rather than knowledge about nature and the laws of the  universe. These very issues still constitute the main challenges for the  philosophy of values today, and they can be included under a general  label as the problem of values. Contemporary philosophy, despite its own specificity and prob- lematics, continues to search for answers and proposals on values, and  philosophers participate in the debate over the problem of values in  various ways. The American pragmatists, for example, have opted for  the relative rather than the absolute status of values, for their social  meaning rather than individual, for their dynamic character rather than  static, for their instrumental nature rather than intrinsic, for practical  criteria of valuations rather than speculative, for axiological pluralism  rather than axiological monism, and for the active melioration of the  world rather than for passive contemplation of its beauty and truth.  Obviously, this does not mean at all that Charles Sanders Peirce, Wil- liam James, John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, and Richard Rorty  shared a unanimous position with respect to values; rather, this means  that the general tone of their writings on the issue is more or less coher- ent and that their outlooks are more or less similar.  George Santayana, no less than any of the above, was a unique per- sonage on the philosophical scene, and he evoked many debates on his  thought, including its axiological character. Small wonder, there are  some scholars who stress that Santayana was deeply preoccupied with  the problem of values, and there are scholars who do not seem to share  this view. Apart from this, there has been a profound discussion about  how much Santayana’s positions are akin to American pragmatism and  here, too, we have a variety of opinions. Angus Kerr-Lawson refers to  one of them in “An Abulensean Pragmatist?” The very term “abulen- sean,” in the Santayanian context, was introduced by Pedro Garcia  Martin in his book El sustrato abulense de Jorge Santayana (The Avilian  Background of George Santayana),3 and one of its main messages, as I  take it, is to detect and emphasize the huge role of the Mediterranean  tradition in general and the “Spanishness” in particular in Santayana’s  philosophy. Namely, Martin shows in his book how the role of Castil- ian elements was significant for Santayana and, consequently, how in- complete in their views are those scholars who neglect these elements in  Santayana’s work and treat him exclusively or predominantly either as  533 Angus Kerr-Lawson, Abulensean Pragmatism, and the Problem of Values • Krzysztof (chris) Piotr Skowronski </page> <page sequence="3"> an American philosopher or as an American pragmatist. “Abulensean,”  then, means that we should all remember the non-pragmatic and non- American parts of Santayana’s thought; how large and how meaningful  these parts are is a question for commentators and readers to decide. Below, I take a look at an important voice in these debates, one of the  most eminent experts on the topic, Angus Kerr-Lawson. More precise- ly, I want to investigate the point of junction of these two debates—i.e.  first, on Santayana’s philosophy of values and, second, on Santayana’s  links with American pragmatism—and to see what Kerr-Lawson has to  say about it. Let me add from my side, that the problem of values can  be seen, amongst other things, as a good test of Santayana’s pragmatism;  that is to say, by means of understanding what attitude towards values  the pragmatists have had, one can judge whether Santayana shared with  them a view on such important issues as what is good, what is beautiful,  what is true, what is excellent for humanity, and what understanding of  progress (or success) social institutions should promote. If he did not  share with them these views, and I believe he did not, he can hardly be  admitted into the pragmatist camp, unless we think of some other areas  of philosophical interest—and, it seems to me, that the philosophy of  knowledge would be the strongest link between the American pragma- tists and Santayana. Hence, in my view, we should join Kerr-Lawson in his reservations,  expressed so clearly in “An Abulensean Pragmatist?,” “Pragmatism and  Santayana’s Realms,” and “Santayana’s Limited Pragmatism” about the  inclusion of Santayana in the pragmatist fold, which has been proposed  by some scholars,4 and his following statement, which I believe to be  one of the most to the point with respect to this issue in the secondary  literature: “I cannot think that Santayana lived in the house of pragma- tism. Perhaps it was one of his early transient hotels” (BSS, 10, p. 21).5  However, and this is the bone of contention between Kerr-Lawson and  me, when he claims, rightly in my view, that “Santayana differs with the  pragmatists on most important issues,”6 he fails to include the problem  of values among these “most important issues.” One can only speculate  that he does not do so because, firstly, the problem of values is, for  Kerr-Lawson, not the most important issue, although he recognizes the  problem of values in Santayana. Secondly, Santayana, in Kerr-Lawson’s  view, did not differ from the pragmatists on the problem of values.  Thirdly, the problem of values is not independent or autonomous, or  conspicuous enough in philosophy, and, therefore, can be successively  dealt with while discussing other issues, such as freedom, liberty, mo- rality, and so on. Fourthly, perhaps he does not include the problem of  values because he believed it was not important for Santayana. Fifthly,  Kerr-Lawson has for some reason failed to detect or recognize San- tayana’s idea of values. Sixthly, and finally, perhaps Kerr-Lawson does  not deal with the philosophy of values in a more profound way because  534 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 4 </page> <page sequence="4"> he takes Santayana literally. That is, he explains Santayana’s philosophy  rather than interprets it; consequently, since Santayana does not use axi- ological terminology, Kerr-Lawson also does not do so. Connected with the first option we have Kerr-Lawson’s almost com- plete silence on Santayana’s philosophy of values, although for many  scholars this seems to be one of the main axes, if not the main one, of  Santayana’s philosophy. Thus, Bertrand Russell says that “Santayana,  like Spinoza, is to be read not so much on account of his theoretic  doctrines, as on account of his view as to what constitutes the good  life, and of his standard of values in art and in morals.”7 Irving Singer  follows this and prizes Santayana’s humanistic philosophy for, among  other things, “creating or discovering values and expressing them in  action as well as through works of art” (BSS, 4, p. 29). Also Timothy  Sprigge, in his well-known book on Santayana, writes: “Most impor- tant of all for us today is Santayana’s treatment of mind, and of moral  and spiritual values, from the point of view of a philosophy which is,  in one important sense of the word, materialist.”8 Stephen Pepper goes  the farthest by claiming that Santayana’s “whole philosophy is a theory  of value, or rather an attitude distributing values among things” (PGS,  p. 219). More importantly, we have Santayana himself who, although  not creating a theory of values nor attempting to pay special attention  to some of the axiological categories in a systematic way, nevertheless  wrote nearly all his works from the point of view of “perfection,” “a  good life,” and “beauty.” Thus, many of his readers remember that in  his first philosophical book he wrote that “All values are in one sense  aesthetic. . .. Even the knowledge of truth . . . is an aesthetic delight; for  when the truth has no further practical utility, it becomes a landscape,”9  and, in the very last sentence of his last book published during his  life, he wrote about the wisdom that lies in understanding each good  life in its physical complexion and its moral essence.10 Kerr-Lawson’s  silence on this issue is conspicuous, and the most telling avoidance of  the discussion on the topic can be found in “Six Aspects of Santayana’s  Philosophy,” where he fails to comment (beyond more than one or two  sentences) on one of the six aspects of Santayana’s philosophy that are  mentioned in the very title of the paper, namely, the one devoted to  “ethical relativity.” The second option—according to which Santayana and the pragma- tists have a common philosophy of values—is expressed in one of San- tayana’s clearest statements on the nature of values: “Value is something  relative, a dignity which anything may acquire in view of the benefit  or satisfaction, which it brings to some living being.”11 However, this  statement—presented in a book devoted to Platonism and the spiritual  life, that is, topics which do not sound pragmatic at all—is ambigu- ous and its pragmatic tone seems, on second thought, no stronger than  Santayana’s criticism of utilitarianism and instrumentalism as well as of  535 Angus Kerr-Lawson, Abulensean Pragmatism, and the Problem of Values • Krzysztof (chris) Piotr Skowronski </page> <page sequence="5"> anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism, all so conspicuously present  in pragmatism. Thus, on the one hand, Santayana talks, as the prag- matists do, about the relative status of values and about the benefit as  well as the satisfaction one can get from a valuable thing; nevertheless,  he writes in this very definition about two things that seem very non- pragmatic. The first is dignity, and mentioning this term in the context  of a definition of “value” at once reminds us of the Stoic (and Kantian)  division of values into those that are precious or have some price or are  equivalent to their usefulness, and those that have dignity or are priceless  and not instrumental at all. In Seneca’s Epistles (LXXI, 33) one can read  that there are values that are precious and there are values that have dig- nitas, and it is by means of realization of dignity, rather than realization  of precious acts, things, and states of affairs, that human life is filled with  a nobler character. Almost exactly the same was repeated by Kant in his  Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, where he said that within the  Kingdom of Ends there are means to dignity, that is, an absolute inner  worth. Nevertheless, it was in The Realm of Spirit that Santayana most  openly rejected relativism, saying that “it is ignorance in the heart, igno- rance of its spiritual vocation, to attach itself absolutely to anything rela- tive.”12 However, Santayana’s philosophy of values is not a copy of the  Stoic idea of dignity, nor of the Stoic idea of disinterestedness, nor of any  of Kant’s thought. Thus, he also writes, in this very definition of values,  about the “living being” rather than humans as the agents or the “recipi- ents” of the benefit or satisfaction, which can be seen as an articulation  of Santayana’s rejection of anthropocentrism (and anthropomorphism),  a point of departure from the pragmatists. It should be added that one of  the most significant ideas of Santayana’s philosophy, that is psyche, refers  to all living beings, not just to humans (cf. DP, p. 14), and what he calls  “foreground” in his acute criticism of John Dewey—especially in San- tayana’s “Dewey’s Naturalistic Metaphysics”13—has much in common  with Dewey’s narrowing down of the world of values exclusively to the  sphere of human practice.  It could be assumed, that the third option is the closest to the truth.  That is to say, Kerr-Lawson sees values under the name or in the con- text of other questions, usually moral, such as liberty, freedom, and free  will. However, under closer examination, it is difficult to detect in his  writings on these topics a clear articulation of the problem of values;  Kerr-Lawson’s analysis of Santayana’s ideas of freedom, liberty, and will  move rather away from what one would want to see in the clearly axi- ological categories of objectivism or relativism or subjectivism or absolut- ism, and some others. Thus, in Kerr-Lawson’s “Freedoms in Santayana:  Psychic, Logical, Vacant, Moral, Spiritual,” “Santayana and Limited  Government,” and “Freedom and Free Will in Spinoza and Santayana,”  he does not write about the valuable agents, deeds, and states of affairs  that could be had by freedom, liberty, and free will; rather he analyzes  536 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 4 </page> <page sequence="6"> the biological, genetic, mental, psychological, volitional, social, eco- nomic, and even logical conditions for freedom and liberty to take place.  However, one can argue that if, as Kerr-Lawson writes, “Santayana sees  contingency everywhere in the cosmos, not determinism,”14 the main  challenge, therefore, would be for Santayana to explore what should  be done to make one’s life good and worthy of living. One can fur- ther claim that this was important to Santayana both in the individual  dimension, where the excellence of a particular life was a significant  aim in his thought, as well as in the social and political dimension(s),  of which the idea of timocracy or government by men of eminence15 is  a telling illustration. In my opinion, Santayana’s philosophical project  about the shape and the condition of contemporary societies in the so- called civilized world has, generally speaking, an axiological character,  as it was in the case of the Greeks. Santayana referred to this link very  clearly in his writings: “Among the Greeks the idea of happiness was  aesthetic and that of beauty moral; and this not because the Greeks  were confused but because they were civilized.”16 Also, Santayana fol- lows the ancient Greeks in thinking of individual life in axiological  terms. Thus, he imitates Aristotle in claiming that real progress (or suc- cess) means “perfections to be achieved” (DP, p. 337). In this, I should  claim, one can find, anthropologically, answers to many questions as  regards, for example, the normative aspects of Santayana’s axiology and  the split with those of the American pragmatists, who understood prog- ress predominantly as the development of democratic institutions and  avoidance of various types of social injustice. Perhaps, then, it is the fourth option that is the right one, and when  one reads Kerr-Lawson’s “Whither Santayana’s Aesthetics?” one might  be led to the conclusion that the philosophy of values was not impor- tant to Santayana; if it had been important he would not have neglect- ed aesthetics as a discipline that deals with arts from the point of view  of beauty, perfection, and excellence. Therefore, Kerr-Lawson notices  that the later Santayana—after publishing his first philosophical book,  which was devoted to aesthetics—“never returned to the topic of aes- thetics” (BSS, 17, p. 35), and in the very same text Kerr-Lawson no- ticed, rightly in my view, that Santayana never returned to the topic of  aesthetics understood as an autonomous discipline, because he did not  believe that aesthetics is an autonomous discipline and as such incor- porated it more tightly into the whole texture of his system of thought.  This, however, does not have to mean that, for Santayana, the problem  of values was of no or little significance, especially in that he followed  the ancient Greeks in the idea of kalokagatia, or the unity of the good  and the beautiful. Moreover, he claimed, in The Sense of Beauty, that  kalokagatia is “perhaps the finest flower of human nature” (SB, p. 31),  and therefore he did not want, except for academic reasons, to separate  aesthetics from ethics, or the beautiful from the good. 537 Angus Kerr-Lawson, Abulensean Pragmatism, and the Problem of Values • Krzysztof (chris) Piotr Skowronski </page> <page sequence="7"> It is plausible, then, that the fifth option could be the most accu- rate, that is, that Kerr-Lawson has failed to recognize the philosophy  of values in Santayana’s work. Indeed, one must admit that Santayana’s  thought was not articulated very clearly regarding the use of strictly  axiological terms, especially value, and of consequently kept axiological  categories, such as absolute, objective, relative, subjective, etc. Thus, in  “An Abulensean Pragmatist?” Kerr-Lawson takes a look at the problem  of pragmatism in Santayana, and while discussing Dewey’s pragmatism  he says almost nothing about the problem of values, although, as I sug- gested above, it is the problem of values that can be seen as a litmus test  for the density of pragmatic factors in the philosophy of Santayana and  for the significance of the difference between him and Dewey. Briefly,  Dewey’s approach to values can be labeled as “instrumentalism,” that  is such a position according to which values are tools for the realization  of human aims, which, in turn, become other tools for the realiza- tion of further or higher aims. Although Santayana clearly admits that  some values are instrumental and, thus, relative, there are such states of  things that are not instrumental at all and should be seen as worthy in  themselves, that is without converting them to ulterior purposes. In  addition to this, for Dewey, the instrumental character of various deeds  and states of things means that they are in service to universal social  targets, and, hence, have a definite social dimension, whereas in Santa- yana’s work, the social aspect was not so much stressed. From this point  of view, Deweyan social unity can be opposed to Santayanian social  atomism, where each individual—rather than society in general—is the  focal point of the world of values and deserves his or her own singular  and particular option for the evaluation of things and states of things.  Next, according to the pragmatic (and Deweyan) understanding of val- ues, they have dynamic character, whereas for Santayana, very clearly,  there are things and states of things that should be contemplated sub  specie aeternitatis, that is as if they were eternally static, fixed forever,  and defined for good. It is true, while discussing the relation between  Dewey and Santayana, Kerr-Lawson mentions the “ethics of detach- ment” as one of the differences between them and adds that in today’s  philosophical world “detachment is perhaps not seen to be so detestable  as before” (BSS, 10, p. 19), but he does not explore this in the con- text of values, nor does he make out of this the theoretical controver- sies regarding both philosophical comparisons between Santayana and  Dewey, and relations between Santayana’s thought and pragmatism.  It seems to me that in two texts Kerr-Lawson approaches, but does  not fully engage, Santayana’s philosophy of values. The first is “San- tayana: Objective Overreach?” and the other is “Whither Santayana’s  Aesthetics?” In the former he does not mention the problem of val- ues, although it was a wonderful opportunity to do so, because ob- jectivity—discussed by Kerr-Lawson exclusively in the epistemological  538 T R A N S A C T I O N S  Volume 45 Number 4 </page> <page sequence="8"> context—is one of the main and the most useful axiological categories  by means of which one can define the status of values and localize, on- tologically, their place in reality. Namely, objective value, in its mode of  being, does not depend on (particular) agents, as the subjective does,  nor is it changeable, as relative value is, yet it constitutes a more or less  stable framework within which the good, the beautiful, and the true  are found to be obligatory, valid, and, one may add, normative. Do we  have adequate access to this framework? And how can we get c ertainty  about objectivity? Kerr-Lawson actually suggests an answer to this ques- tion quite succinctly, although insufficiently: “It is perfectly coherent  to refer to objects without being able to define them.”17 This is quite  close to Santayana’s understanding of values; for example, beauty, San- tayana says, is “a vital harmony felt and fused into an image under the  form of eternity” (AFSL, p. 422) and, elsewhere, that there is potential  beauty of all sorts latent in the world (DP, p. ix). Let me also add that it  is premature to claim, in a definite way, whether there is some kind of  hierarchy of images or essences in Santayana’s work; although I should  follow Kerr-Lawson in his remarks forwarded in “Realms and Hierar- chies,” according to which there is nothing like a metaphysical system  of hierarchies in Santayana’s thought. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to  ask whether, say, the image or essence of a good and harmonious life  was for him on the same level, “democratically” arranged side by side  with an image or essence of a corrupted and disharmonious life. In “Whither Santayana’s Aesthetics?” Kerr-Lawson gets close to deal- ing with Santayana’s philosophy of values. He answers his title’s ques- tion by pointing to Santayana’s idea of the intuition of essence. This  is, I think, a good way to start to get to an understanding of what is  meant by seeing things sub specie aeternitatis, so frequently mentioned  by Santayana: that is to say, by seeing things through a more or less in- tense attention to or “a steady contemplation of all things in their order  and worth” (TPP, p. 10–11). In addition to that, Kerr-Lawson, in that  very paper, quotes Santayana’s view on the special role of retentiveness  which seems to complement the position according to which valuable  objects and states of affairs are kept within the scope of memory, under- standing, and appreciation. It is by means of such an attitude that the  dignity of things can be perceived and comprehended on the one hand  and, on the other, that the dignity of perceivers can be maintained and  developed. All this, be it noted, does not preclude Santayana’s sympathy  with the American pragmatists regarding the instrumental character of  some values. It seems to me that Santayana, like Peirce,18 had a some- what broader view on what values are than did James, Dewey, Mead,  and Rorty, because he was able to recognize the weight and meaning  of both instrumental and non-instrumental values and, in his writings,  referred copiously to both traditions existing in philosophy. Thus, apart  from his sentiments concerning those trends that emphasize the role of  539 Angus Kerr-Lawson, Abulensean Pragmatism, and the Problem of Values • Krzysztof (chris) Piotr Skowronski </page> <page sequence="9"> non-instrumental values, such as Platonism, Stoicism, and Catholicism  in the West as well as Hindu thought in the East, he also referred to  philosophical movements that stressed, rightly, the role of instrumental  values, like the Epicureans, especially when they aimed at elevation of  the quality of everyday and earthly life. Most likely, then, it is option number six that should serve us as the  correct answer to the question that was put forward at the beginning  of the present paper. Namely, Kerr-Lawson does not want to trespass  onto the area of philosophy of values in his investigations because San- tayana explicitly does not do so himself; rather, it seems to me, Kerr- Lawson prefers to stick to the terminology, style, and area that were  used and explored by Santayana himself in his works. In this, I mean in  explaining Santayana, Kerr-Lawson provides us with closely considered  comments, criticisms, and reflections that constitute an extraordinarily  interesting insight into Santayana’s system of thought and, more impor- tantly, gives us something much more: namely, a living continuation of  Santayana’s philosophy. This is seen best in “The Natural Claims of  Spirit,” where Kerr-Lawson explains to us issues (e.g. ideas, morality,  aims, duty, detachment, and spirit) that could have been interpreted,  by someone else, from the point of view of philosophy of values. This  is good, and such explanatory attempts are always needed because they  preserve the orthodoxy of the original message and make it clearer. They  (the explanatory attempts) are also, in my view, not always complete  and should be assisted by various interpretations. Each generation and  the representatives of each tradition reread and reinterpret the works of  past masters from various viewpoints and sundry perspectives accord- ing to new experiences, fresh challenges, original inspirations, contrary  ways of thinking, and alien mentalities. This makes the picture of given  work fuller and more revealing; it also explores the work more generally  with an eye to the benefit of other cultures and future generations. To  put it in other words, we need such scholars as Kerr-Lawson, and at the  same time we need other scholars who would impose upon Santayana  new schemes of interpretation in order to see him and his output in a  new light and, perhaps, in a brighter perspective. Summing up, let me observe that without doubt Angus Kerr-  Lawson is one of the very best Santayana scholars; he explains to us  many aspects of Santayana’s thought and is very honest and faithful in  doing so. It is especially amazing to realize that he has been doing this  excellent work over the course of some thirty years. It should be added,  however, that he has done even more: namely, he has become one of  the most sophisticated developers of Santayana’s philosophy. Thanks to  him, Santayana’s philosophy remains alive and still attractive for many  people from different countries in its pure essence.

The philosophy of values or axiology (also: value inquiries), understood  as a philosophical sub-discipline dealing with values and valuations, started in  the late 19th century (Rudolph Herman Lotze, Franz Brentano, Christian von  Ehrenfels) and developed in the 20th, especially thanks to the Phenomenologists  (especially Max Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, and Roman Ingarden); a strong  impact on axiological reflection was also presented by Frederick Nietzsche with  his idea of the revaluation of all values as well as by the Baden Neo-Kantians  (especially Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm Windelband), Sigmund Freud, G.E.  Moore, the American Pragmatists, and some members of the artistic vanguard.  In the U.S., the most profound theoretical works on the philosophy of values  were provided by John Dewey (Theory of Valuation), R. B. Perry (General Theory  of Values, Realms of Values), Bertrand Emil Jessup (Relational Value Meanings), and  W. M. Urban (Valuation). 2. Cf.
