<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tamar Yacobi Package Deals in Fictional Narrative: The Case of the Narrator's (Un)Reliability The authors of Vanity Fair, The Brothers Karamazov, Don Quixote, or "The Overcoat"?to cite a few notable examples?partly divest their narrators of re liability, though leaving them as variously omniscient as George Eliot's. . . . Whatever logic or theology may lead us to expect, there are no package-deals in narration. ?Meir Sternberg, "Varieties of Omniscient Narration," in Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction As my epigraph points out, there are no package deals in narrative, least of all between surface forms or features and their effects. Instead, given the endless vari ability of context, the same form or formal pattern can always serve as means to dif ferent effects, and vice versa.1 One must not, therefore, confuse even typical or plausible configurations in literature with categorical rules. Yet their plausible look and their occurrence in certain well-known exemplars often drive scholars toward re ducing the vast set of choices open to the literary practitioner to a short list of famil iar options. Within narratology, a major case in point is the narrator's positioning between the reliable and the unreliable extreme. In current accounts of the issue, quite a few old dogmas still persist, however questionable in theory and false in practice. High among them stands the dogma that embodied voices from within the tale's fictional world (so-called homodiegetic narrators) are alone fallible. By a kindred wide con sensus, the presence or absence of such fallibility supposedly depends on a full length portrait of the teller?as if there were a necessary linkage between the teller's overall make-up (existential, psychological, etc.) and the (un)reliability of the telling. There ensue two ready-made narrative identikits, so to speak, one modeled Tamar Yacobi is Senior Lecturer of Poetics and Comparative Literature at Tel-Aviv University. She has published essays in Poetics Today, Style, and other journals on the narrator's unreliability, interart transfer (ekphrasis), the poetics of Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), H. James's "Daisy Miller," and, recently, on John Ashbery's "Description of a Masque." NARRATIVE, Vol. 9, No. 2 (May 2001) Copyright 2001 by The Ohio State University</page><page sequence="2">224 Tamar Yacobi on the supernatural figure throughout, the other human-like. However, each of them forms at most a likely correlation, but neither an imperative nor an exclusive linkage, as my previous work has demonstrated and as I would reemphasize here.2 Clean against the fixed identikit model of the narrator, I would argue that the judgment of a narration as unreliable?or otherwise?is always an interpretive, hy pothetical move. As such, further, it always has competitors that suggest a reading of the data along lines that need not involve, much less target and determine, point of view. (Un)reliability is one of five types of hypothesis or integration-mechanism, whereby we readers account for textual incongruities. Confronted with these incon gruities, we may always appeal instead to at least four alternative logics of resolu tion: the genetic, the generic, the existential, and/or the functional, as I call them. What distinguishes the perspectival mechanism, or the unreliability hypothesis, is that it brings discordant elements into pattern by attributing them to the peculiarities of the speaker or observer through whom the world is mediated. This mediator's de ficiencies, we then go on to explain?e.g., incompetence, untruthfulness, unaware ness, misjudgment?are manipulated for a variety of ends: rhetorical (notably irony of some kind), psychological, thematic, etc. And by a reverse hypothesis of con gruity, we deduce reliable narration.3 From the reader's viewpoint, however, the alternative integrating lines are al ways available. This versatility explains and legitimizes interpretive disagreements within a common theoretical frame, even a common single mechanism, disabling anything like a fixed correspondence between trigger and mechanism. For the same textual signs of tension, the same d?viances from whatever norm we bring to the reading (ideological, actional, psychological, grammatical, etc.), may in principle be resolved via any logic(s) of integration. Thus, a narrator's delay of relevant informa tion may be referred to personal constraints and desires that expose unreliability and/or to authorized devices: generic conventions, as in the detective story, func tional values like surprise, etc.4 Nor does the perspectival or unreliability hypothesis itself automatically relate to other traits of the narrator or to any a priori poetic goal?psychological, thematic, ideological, what you will. We may of course begin reading in the light of such stereotypes, figurai or functional, but must be prepared to qualify, even invert, them at any moment in response to the text's specific disclosures. Yet narratologists con tinue to divide tellers between polar portraits: the heterodiegetic, omniscient and/hence-reliable vs. the homodiegetic, who is limited in knowledge and/hence inherently unreliable, along with the rest of us humans. Examples of this "narrator-portrait" fallacy abound. Here is how Wayne Booth approvingly summarizes the assumption: "Though it is most evident when a narrator tells the story of his own adventures, we react to all narrators as persons" (273 my emphasis). Accordingly, while we know better than to confuse the narrator with the author (or the lyric persona with the poet) we tend or ought, as it were, to envisage and evaluate fictional narrators in reference to an all-embracing character type. By such assimilation of narrative features to overall portraiture and of art to life, William Riggan attributes "inherent fallibility" (21) to flesh and blood narrators. "Precisely because the narrator sits before us as a human being?albeit a fictionalized one?we</page><page sequence="3">Package Deals: The Narrator's (Unreliability 225 naturally react to him in varying degrees in human terms and not just as a disembod ied voice providing us with information" (20). Polar linkages ensue as "axiomatic principle[s]" (19). On the one hand, human restriction and consequent ?^reliability are the lot of Riggan's Picaros, Madmen, Naifs, and Clowns. On the other hand, there is the reliability of omniscient "disembodied voices," such as Tolstoy's narrator in War and Peace (19). Either way, the fusion of the two issues?reliability and knowledge?neither begins nor ends with Riggan. Thus Booth encapsulates the link age in his reference to the frustrating narrative commentator "who claims omni science and reveals stupidity and prejudice," and to "the tradition of the intruding narrator, omniscient or unreliable" (221). The binarism?at least on this front?continues with James Phelan and Mary Patricia Martin some decades later. They limit the issue to "unreliable homodiegetic narration" ("Lessons" 88 my emphasis), as if the teller who exists and speaks outside the fictive world were immune from reliability judgments. Even where literary ex amples (e.g., Fitzgerald's Nick) suggest that what the theory considers "paradoxical" does happen, and "an author may also create an effective homodiegetic narrator who fluctuates between being unreliable and being (apparently) omniscient," (Phelan, "Reexamining" 105), the binary montage of (un)reliability and knowledge persists. Although the device shows itself "rhetorically effective" (105) as well as feasible, the theorist's response is not to abandon the problematic assumptions but to add ad hoc twists as above. Yet why should "being unreliable" contrast with "being (appar ently) omniscient" in the first place? By fiction's own logic, indeed, no such fixed contrast holds. It does apply in some contexts, to be sure, yet it needn't and elsewhere doesn't. The most evidently limited teller may speak for the implied author, or for ourselves, while the unlimited may prove untrustworthy. Ultimately, it all depends on whether or not the (unrelia bility hypothesis offers us a way of resolving tensions in the text by attributing them to the narrator's shortcomings. And even when attributed, those shortcomings?like the tensions they resolve?need not bear on the information available to the object of our judgment. Other issues, from the social to the aesthetic, may rank higher in the narrative. To substantiate my claim, let me briefly compare two examples. They comple ment each other in refuting the predetermined narrator's identikit, especially the au tomatic linkage between knowledge and reliability. The tale "Gimpel the Fool," by Isaac Bashevis Singer, begins thus: "I am Gim pel the fool. I don't think myself a fool. On the contrary. But that's what folks call me. They gave me the name while I was still in school. I had seven names in all: im becile, donkey, flax-head, dope, glump, ninny, and fool. The last name stuck. What did my foolishness consist of? I was easy to take in" (9). Throughout, Gimpel mani fests his extreme simplicity, on which the entire town plays and trades. Just before her death, the wife that he had been lured into taking confesses that he didn't father any of their six children. To the reader, who has learnt that Gimpel's first child was born four months after the marriage ceremony, this hardly comes as a surprise. On Gimpel, the discovery has such a shattering effect that he is tempted to take a cruel revenge on the townspeople, and is only saved at the last moment by his better judg</page><page sequence="4">226 Tamar Yacobi ment. Or rather, his better feelings, since Gimpel is unable to weigh the pros and cons in abstract ethical terms. Hence, the temptation is embodied in the Spirit of Evil who appears in a dream. Then his dead wife appears in another dream, and her suf ferings in hell for her sins prompt him to abandon his revenge. As this turning point suggests, whatever his informational and intellectual deficiencies, they are more than counterbalanced by his moral sense: the tensions are ultimately resolved in favor of the simple teller. This rank order, and with it the resolution of conflicting values, mean that Gim pel breaks the typical mold as narrator and character at once. The tale implies a hier archy of norms, rather than any standard divide that would mark him as negative by one yardstick of telling or conduct and as positive by another. The informational fac tor does not equal and oppose the ethical, but ultimately ranks below it: artistic orig inality apart, this makes quite a difference to the hero's evaluation in either role. The implied hierarchy is nicely summed up by the town's rabbi. In answer to Gimpel's complaint against his tormentors, he says: "It is written, better to be a fool all your days than for one hour to be evil. You are not a fool. They are the fools. For he who causes his neighbor to feel shame loses Paradise himself" (10). Ironically, the religious leader fails to transmit this upside-down ideology to his own daughter, who makes fun of Gimpel the minute he leaves the rabbinical court. Gimpel, on the other hand, foregoes revenge, gets rid of all his earthly possessions, and becomes a wandering teller of tales who awaits death with equanimity. His last words express his simple faith: "When the time comes I will go joyfully. Whatever may be there [in heaven], it will be real, without complication, without ridicule, without deception. God be praised: there even Gimpel cannot be deceived" (23). These words evoke nothing if not respect. So Gimpel refutes the narratological stereotype. For all his limitations, you cannot reduce him to the main butt of irony without reducing yourself to the town's level of cheap, wicked smartness. Where we laugh at him?and who can help it??we feel guilty ourselves by association. Since the narrative as a whole implies the priority of moral fiber over wit and access to data, Gimpel's narration is better integrated within a hypothesis of ultimate reliabil ity?despite appearances?than in terms of apparent folly. My second example, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, breaks the inverse linkage. The narrator certainly manifests, even declares his omniscience. Yet is he consequently, or invariably, reliable? For brevity, let me focus on his commentary toward the end of Chapter Eight ("Private and Confidential"). Earlier, the chapter quotes a letter of Becky Sharp, conveying to Amelia Sedley her first impressions of the baronial household that she has newly joined. In response to her sarcastic portraits of the family, the narrator dissociates himself from Becky Sharp as a judge of human nature, and proceeds to generalize by way of analogy on the relations between addressor and audience. His analogues include a priest, a clown, an Italian street-corner storyteller, French actors, English impresarios, and thriller-writers. Their common denominator is the passing of judgment on characters and their deeds. But the passage is notable for the abundance and complexity of its internal incongruities. These include (1) the disparity between Becky's "crimes" so far and the violent criticism leveled against her by the narrator; (2) the discrepancy</page><page sequence="5">Package Deals: The Narrator's (Unreliability 227 between the stated purpose of the analogies and their actual effect; (3) tensions be tween adjacent narratorial statements within this passage as well as with other parts of the novel. First, Becky's transgressions have so far been confined to husband-hunting and sharply observing the vanities of her fellow humans. Her letter to Amelia thus sati rizes all the members of the Crawley household she has just entered. And the narra tor himself will soon admit that her "accounts" were apt descriptions, "not caricatures" (121). At this early stage, moreover, Becky has neither snubbed the Sed leys, her former benefactors, nor exploited her husband, nor ignored her son. The re ligious negatives ("Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless") used to judge her performance, therefore, sound in context like gross exaggerations (117). Second, the narrator juxtaposes two illustrative anecdotes to puzzling effect. In the first, an Italian street-teller "work[s] himself up into such a rage ... with some of the villains" of his tale, that the audience join him in "a roar of oaths and execrations against the fictitious monster" and fill his hat with coins (116). So the Italian fiction maker profits by excessive condemnations. In the second tale, the French actors join their spectators not only in cursing the villains of the piece, but in the purity of their motives. For their salary is cut because they refuse to play the wicked parts ("such as those of infames Anglais, brutal Cossacks" [116]). Thackeray's narrator explains the point of the doublet: "I set the two stories one against the other, so that you may see that it is not from mere mercenary motives that the present performer is desirous to show up and trounce his villains; but because he has a sincere hatred of them, which he cannot keep down, and which must find a vent in suitable abuse and bad lan guage" (116-17). A dubious explanation, this, because the narrator's self-alliance with the high-minded French actors against the commercial storyteller clashes (inter alia) with the professional analogy that emerges here. It is rather the latter per former?called "a brother of the story-telling trade," "preaching to a pack of good for-nothing honest lazy fellows"?who would appear the more analogous to the showman of Vanity Fair vis-?-vis his own audience. But, if the folk-teller belabors the villain for a few more coins, one cannot help wondering about the motives of our narrator in exaggerating Becky's crimes, particularly when he later admits the accu racy of her portraits. So, regardless of omniscience, does the self-defeating analogy imply an ironic narratorial mask or an ironized narratorial slip? Finally, in the very last paragraph, an outright inconsistency appears to mar the narrator's rejection of Becky's satirical vein: "Otherwise you might fancy it was I who was sneering ... it was I who laughed ... whereas the laughter comes from one who has no reverence except for prosperity, and no eye for anything beyond success. Such people there are living and flourishing in the world?Faithless, Hopeless, Charityless; let us have at them, dear friends, with might and main. Some there are, and very successful too, mere quacks and fools: and it was to combat and expose such as those, no doubt, that Laughter was made" (117). How are we to reconcile the preacher's attack on "sneering" and "laughter" with his praise of "Laughter"? Do the opposed postures suggest that the laughters vary in kind, or that the narrator speaks tongue in cheek, or that the author dissociates himself, though in different degrees, from both Becky and her showman?</page><page sequence="6">228 Tamar Yacobi To integrate the passage, then, the reader must choose or shuttle among three al ternative perspectival constructs at least: (1) The narrator is somehow reliable in con text and the characters alone are morally deviant. (2) The narrator assumes an ironic mask, pretending to share the failings of his characters. (3) The narrator, like the heroine, betrays the unreliability of the Fair. And knowing Thackeray's artistic tem perament, we can add the genetic mechanism: (4) The sloppy or ambivalent author, instead of tightly organizing his materials, has left incongruous elements in his text.5 But whatever you decide, the teller's superhuman knowledge remains unchanged, just like Gimpel's vulnerable and endearing ignorance. There are neither shortcuts nor package deals in explicating, or theorizing, literary texts. ENDNOTES 1. Diametrically opposed to package dealing, this "Proteus Principle" has been theorized by Sternberg as the first law of communication, narrative or otherwise, and applied on a wide front: to reported dis course (e.g., "Proteus"), sequence (e.g., Expositional; "Telling"), group portraiture (Hebrews), as well as point of view (e.g., Expositional, esp. 254-305; "Mimesis," esp. 172-86). 2. A more rigorous analysis of the trait-packaging approach would be: "The fixed anthropomorphic cate gorization of the possessor of the trait [of (un)reliability] determines or influences its conception as a component of a portrait that is marked by statistical, logical and psychological probability. Accord ingly, the semantic feature of plus-reliability automatically goes together with omniscience, veracity, existence outside the fictive world and (sometimes) explicit commentary. And minus-reliability as 'properly' belongs with limited range of knowledge, intentional mendacity and unintentional distor tion, and existence within the fictive world" (Yacobi, "Fictional" 119-20). For elaboration of related points, see my articles in Works Cited and further references there. 3. The means-end relation implied by unreliability is yet another domain of automatic linkage, as though it were predetermined. Thus Wall lays down that "the purpose ... of unreliable narration is to fore ground certain elements of the narrator's psychology" (21); and Niinning follows suit (59). As both my examples below will illustrate, there is no such functional monopoly. 4. By the same token, however, to view a narratorial device as authorized, generically and/or functionally, is not yet to judge the narrator reliable beyond it. In Agatha Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, withholding the truth is thus doubtless "a point on which the 'norms and values' of author and narrator are in sync: it is clever and deceptive to give the narration to the murderer. They collude, as it were, to create the most effective means of rendering the story" (Wall 21). From this point of collusion, how ever, one must not jump, as Wall does, to the absence of ironic distance between them on other points, far less to the dismissal of authorial "norms and values" as the measure of the narrator's (un)reliability. 5.
