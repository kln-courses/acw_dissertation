<plain_text><page sequence="1">356 Vol. 78, No. 310 Journal of American Folklore Oct.-Dec., I965 Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion: A Study in Survivals. By John Cuthbert Lawson; new foreword by Al. N. Oikonomides. (New Hyde Park, New York: University Books, 1964; reprint of I90o edition. Pp. xxii + 620, preface, indexes, illustrations. $io.oo.) This book was written with the classical scholar in mind. When it appeared in 191o its ideas were not as startling nor was it attacked as severely as the author of the new foreword seems to believe. It is true that H. J. Rose had unkind words for it (Folklore XXI 19IO, 529-535), but we must remember that even as late as I953 (A Handbook of Greek Mythology) Rose still took the position that anything ugly or unseemly in Greek belief was not Greek but "Oriental." On the other hand, Gilbert Murray was already at work in 191o on his Five Stages of Greek Religion; it was to Andrew Lang, however, that Murray looked for inspiration. From a historical viewpoint Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion is interesting as a broadside against the attitude then current among classical scholars that the contemporary inhabitants of Greece were a degenerate type of Slav, while the classical Greeks-who had all been blonde and seven feet tall-had migrated to the environs of Berlin, or perhaps London. Lawson was correct in pointing out that the whole of Greek culture could not be read from the fragments of what had been a highly sophisticated literature. But he ventured on dangerous ground in attempting to reconstruct that culture from contemporary "survivals." Even in 191o, and in such a "survivalist" a journal as Folk Lore, Rose correctly pointed out that many of Lawson's items were universal beliefs and practices with parallels in neighboring cultures. And since Lawson was an untrained collector, it may be that he was sometimes "taken" by patriotic and overenthusiastic in- formants, as his reviewers then suggested. But in spite of its defects, most of which belong to the period in which it appeared, Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion remains a storehouse of fascinating materials for the present-day folklorist. The plates which have been added to this edition enhance the value of the book. University of Texas AMERICO PAREDES Austin, Texas Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis. By Robert Graves and Raphael Patai. (Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1964. Pp. 311, introduction, maps, abbreviations, sources, annotated bibliography, index. $4-95.) The riches of rabbinic commentary have saved Robert Graves from some of the in- vention and conflation which mar his treatment of Celtic myth in The White Goddess; and the restraining hand of a competent Talmudist and anthropologist, Raphael Patai, saves him from some of the sins he committed in his equally rich domain of Greek Myths. For Hebrew myths serious students will still turn rather to Ginzberg's seven-volume Legends of the Jews. Yet there is fresh material here, and as always from the hand of Graves, pleasant writing which can lead equally to an O altitudo! or astray. Presenting in each brief chapter Biblical, apocryphal, and haggadic story, the authors provide accurate references to each with commentary historical, anthropological, and oc- casionally fanciful or Gravesean. Apart from availability and conciseness, the book has one advantage over Ginzberg: the haggadic nuggets, their sources, and the commentary are kept clearly apart but conveniently proximate; and the critical bibliography shows compassion for the general audience, which can be easily confused by the co-existence of such titles as Agadat Bereshit, Bereshit Rabba, and Bereshit Rabbati, not to speak of Bate Midrashot and Beth HaMidrash. (The authors should, however, have provided the names of certain translations, like Budge's Cave of Treasures, James's Pseudo-Philo, and the Soncino Talmud and Midrash Rabba, as tokens against Judaic scholarly exclusivism.)</page><page sequence="2">The authors' comparison of Greek and Hebrew myth is sound: the Greeks lack the Hebraic pietistic and political commentary; Greek myth is aristocratic and centered on the cults of separate city-states whereas Hebrew myth is democratic and national; Hebrew myth blurs the time element by ancestral identifications; Greek myths lack the sense of national destiny, the chain of history, the Heilgeschichte which Jew and Christian share. How the commentaries to each chapter work may be illustrated by that on The Fratricide of Cain and Abel. Herdsmen (Abel) force themselves into a farming area (Cain) and share sacrifices with the farmers when a pact is made. But the chief herdsman's sacrifice is accepted by God and the chief farmer murders him and founds a city elsewhere. To this imaginative but plausible anthropological reconstruction the authors add a tribal tattoo (the Mark of Cain), a younger son preference like that of Jacob and Esau, historical relationships with the Kenites of Moab and Seir, and twin culture myths (the last, with a little straining, from Graves, no doubt). Rabbinic embarrassment at the anthropomorphic character of Jacob's wrestling with God leads to a host of explanations, say the authors, quite properly using historical time-depth in exegesis of exegesis. One has cavils; indeed one could not save face in Judaic circles without at least a token barrage. The statement (I ) that "the Bible acknowledges only a single universal God" needs qualification in a book which speaks of the sons of God and the three visitors of Abraham. Untimately synagogic Jews (17) had a democratic heavenly hope as con- trasted to the Elysian elitism of the Greeks; yet in earlier parts of the Old Testament it may be questioned whether the inhabitants of Sheol are not as shadowy as those of Hades, and whether the favoritism of Yahweh for Enoch and Noah is not as great as that of Zeus for Achilles. Much too prevalent is a tendency to treat hypothesis as fact (and often to build on the false equation): Lucifer's Fall and Phaethon's (58-59); Eve with the Babylonian Aruru and Ishtar (79) or with a Hittite Heba and the Greek Hebe (12); the opposition of Sons of God and Daughters of Men regarded as that of Semitic cattle- breeders and Canaanitic agriculturalists (104); the interpretation of Hiwa and Hiya, giant sons of Shemhazai and Azael by mortal women, as mere work-cries (o05); the frequent use of the jus primae noctis (o05, 184, I86)-a supposed custom much more popular among post-medieval savants than it was among the medieval lords themselves; the importation of Byzantine priapism and medieval English witch-cult into pre-Noachic circles (io6); the assured equation of Japheth with Iapetus and of the Titanic castrations with Ham or Canaan's disrespect for Noah (I22)--even Pierre Bayle and the rabbis offer such identities as speculation only; and the tendency to make much of a similarity between Autolycus and Jacob (224), betraying a Hebraic-Hellenic bias which does not take account of the international Tale Type 1525. An analyst of folktales is tempted into strata identification himself, into an attempt to dissect the Pataian layers from the Gravesean. The fact that Palestine is the very locus classicus of patriarchal culture does not keep Graves from his bubbling enthusiasm for the Matriarchy, though he seeks a little qualification by such a remark as "part, at least, of the matriarch's divine prerogatives had been delegated to her male warrior-escort" (26- 28). Rahab, Tiamat-Tehom, and all the possible Akkadian survivals have their day, and Yahweh struggles against water "not only because the Creatrix whom he replaces is a goddess of Fertility, and therefore of water, but because the matriarchate can be portrayed in myth as a chaotic commingling of the two sexes which delays the establishment of patriarchal social order" (30); God both broods and impregnates (31); Lilith and Hecate belie their name of succubi and demand the superior position in sexual intercourse (65, 69); Eve was not created from Adam's rib but from an "iconotropic" misreading (69) of a picture in which the goddess Anath viewed her lover Mot thrusting a dagger beneath the fifth rib of his twin Aliyan. Eden becomes "a jaded city-dweller's nostalgia for simple country joys . . .the celestial paradise is enjoyed in a schizophrenetic trance, induced either by asceticism, by glandular disturbance, or by the use of hallucinogenetic drugs," Book Reviews 357</page><page sequence="3">358 Vol. 78, No. 310 Journal of American Folklore Oct.-Dec., I965 which leads to a delightful digression on Aryan soma and Mexican mushrooms, which should make the book quite popular in our expresso shops, along with Nelson Algren, William Burroughs, and folk-derived music. Strong minds can skim over such evidences of the unquiet Graves kept in leash on the whole by his mentor Patai. While we strive to make our students' minds strong, we shall do well to keep Ginzberg's Legends close at hand, with all its disconveniences. The Ohio State University FRANCIS LEE UTLEY Columbus, Ohio Ancient Festivals of "Saturnalia" Type. By Photeine P. Bourboulis. (Thessaloniki, Helle- nika, Periodic Publications of the Society of Macedonian Studies, Supplement I6, I964. Pp. 6i, introduction, notes.) This brilliantly researched monograph is handicapped by a ponderous style, which conceals as much as it conveys. What could have been a model for the comparative method of investigation, becomes a dull demonstration of scholarship. Using the comparative method, Dr. Bourboulis sets out to show the essential similarities between ancient Greek religion and those of Western Asia and Mesopotamia. For a core of reference she uses the "Saturnalia" type festivals found in the Classical countries and in anterior Asia. She raises two questions at the beginning of her monograph: What are the reasons for the license exercised in festivals of this type? and Are the festivals connected, and if they are connected how can their geographical distribution be accounted for? She attempts to answer these questions by a psychological-historical approach. Taking examples from Persia, Egypt, Rome, Greece and many other countries, Dr. Bourboulis isolates one overriding motive in the festivals: the fear of offensive spirits. With this motive as the research core, she attempts to discover the common chthonic cult which served as the source of these festivals. She concludes that the cult of Dionysus is a later development of Thraco-Phrygian rites. There is also much evidence adduced to show a connection between the many "Saturnalia" type festivals. The question as to geographical distribution is answered less definitely, but careful research indicates that it was widespread throughout the ancient Near East. The author's conclusions are well documented and thoughtful, but her prose makes them difficult to follow. The use of such words as "desderate" in place of "desire," and ab initio in place of "initially" does not help matters. Add to this poor proofreading, and you have a work difficult to read and difficult to understand. It is, nevertheless, well worth the effort. Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science CHARLES E. WELCH, JR. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Cultural Stability and Change among the Montagnais Indians of the Lake Melville Region of Labrador. By John T. McGee. (Washington, D. C.: Catholic University of America Press, I961. "Anthropological Series No. 19." Pp. viii + I59, preface, references, plates, table, map, index. $2.75.) The picture of contemporary Montagnais-Naskapi life recorded by Father McGee affords some interesting parallels and contrasts with processes of cultural dynamics seen among other Northeastern Indian groups. McGee lived among the Northwest River Band in 1942-43 and returned in I95I-53. Rather than concentrate upon the micro-changes that transpired during the ten-year interval, McGee attempts to deal with problems of longer range cultural process. The Northwest River Montagnais have retained much of their traditional culture despite three centuries of intermittent Euro-American contact. It is not so much the</page></plain_text>
