<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRE-HISPANIC COMPONENT OF THE SYNCRETIC CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA Hugo G. Nutini University of Pittsburgh The cult of the dead is an important component of local folk religion in Mesoamerican Indian and Mestizo communities and is also part of the national Catholicism of Mexico and Guatemala. Indeed, in various forms and degrees of intensity the cult of the dead is a functional aspect of community religion throughout Latin America but probably exhibits its highest degree of expression in the countries comprising Nuclear America. Its importance in Mesoamerica is attested in many monographs in which lip service at most is paid to it as an aspect of the local folk religion. Recently (Nutini 1988), I exhaustively describe and analyze the cult of the dead in rural Tlaxcala, centered on the All Saints Day-All Souls Day celebration and place it within the global configuration of the Catholic-folk-pagan religion. This article analyzes the pre-Hispanic component of the cult of the dead that, together with a structural and ideological equivalent of Spanish-Catholic origin, coalesced into a syncretic institution by the middle of the 17th century and has permanently marked the communal and regional discharge of folk Catholicism until the present. In a wider sense, it contributes to the study of syncretism, particularly of its native and folk components, as a historical process stemming from the confrontation of Christianity with many religions of the world. Todos Santos, Dia de Muertos, Dia de los Muertos, Dia de los Difuntos, and Dia de las Animas Benditas are the most common names by which the combined liturgical feasts of All Saints Day and All Souls Day are usually known in Mexico and most of Latin America. After Christmas and Holy Week (Easter), All Saints Day-All Souls Day is the most important celebration in the annual cycle of folk Catholicism in Mesoamerica. Of all the areas of Christendom, it is probably in this culture area that the ritual and ceremonial elaboration of Todos Santos acquires its maximum expression. The folk manifestation of Todos Santos extends well beyond the traditional feasts of All Saints Day and All Souls Day as practiced in orthodox Catholicism and in most regions of Mesoamerica it acquires significant social, economic, demographic, and even recreational dimensions. Todos Santos is a time of homecoming, remembering and propitiating the dead, cementing and intensifying one's kinship and compadrazgo (ritual kinship) relationships, and sacralizing, albeit temporarily, interpersonal relationships on a community- wide basis. During the period elapsing between five days before and seven days after the first and second of November (the heart of the celebration) the country and the city come together, the little community becomes the cosmological center of existence, and individuals and families are renewed by remembering their roots and paying homage to those who have departed. For a transient moment, the living and the dead are joined in shared existence. 57</page><page sequence="2">58 ETHNOLOGY Since the Spanish Conquest, the cult of the dead in Mesoamerica has been centered on Todos Santos and in varying degrees it evolved into a syncretic complex out of pre-Hispanic polytheistic elements and Spanish-Catholic elements. In fact, the cult of the dead in Indian society was the first distinct complex most likely to emerge out of the confrontation of these two religious traditions. The celebration of Todos Santos, however, is not uniform in Mesoamerican societies today. Rather, it exhibits different manifestations that are largely the result of the nature of local polytheistic manifestations at the time of the Conquest, the degree to which particular regions were subjected to the processes of syncretism and acculturation throughout Colonial times, and demographic and cultural variables of more recent origin. While the belief system that supports the cult of the dead has remained fairly constant, the celebration of Todos Santos and its structural implications vary significantly from region to region. For example, in some regions the physical-ritual manifestations of Todos Santos emphasize vigils and the erection of elaborate altars of food and flowers in the cemetery (Michoacan and Northern Mexico), others are noted for the ritual exuberance of processions and other public displays (Chiapas and Highland Guatemala), while still others concentrate on the decoration of home altars and the graves of the dead (Puebla and the Valley of Mexico). Rural Tlaxcala fails into the last category and several communities (Santa Maria Atlihuetzian, San Juan Ixtenco, San Nicolas Panotla, San Francisco Tepeyango, San Francisco Tetlanohca, San Juan Totolac) are deservedly noted for the excellence and artistic decoration of their altars and graves. The sociological and religious implications of the cult of the dead in Mesoamerica, and its ritual and ceremonial manifestation in the annual cycle extending beyond the Todos Santos celebration, are complex and constitute an integral part of the cult of the saints. The regional discharge of the cult of the dead in the second half of the 20th century is a varying syncretic complex but one in which pre-Hispanic components are always important, perhaps predominant, in the configuration of the local folk religion. This is a well known aspect of Mesoamerican Indian and Mestizo religion that has been noticed and occasionally discussed by anthropologists in more than two generations of continuous research. However, the pre-Hispanic background of the syncretic cult of the dead has never been thoroughly and systematically presented. Thus, the following analysis purports to remedy the situation for the ethnohistorically best known part of Mesoamerica. When the Spaniards arrived in Mexico in 1519 they found a widespread polytheistic religion throughout the area that came to be known as Mesoamerica, where the ancient civilization of the New World probably achieved its highest expression. This is certainly the case in the domains of science and religion. A sophisticated calendrical system, the mathematical concept of zero, and a highly complex polytheistic pantheon are the triumphs of Mesoamerican culture, significantly more advanced than Old World cultures at a similar stage of technological development. In pre-Hispanic times Mesoamerica was never unified into a single political unit but was divided into a number of City States or Ceremonial Center States. Sometimes two, three, or four of these units formed alliances (for example, the Triple Alliance, or so-called Aztec empire at the arrival of the Spaniards under</page><page sequence="3">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 59 Cortez) with a minimal degree of cohesion and centralization. Mesoamerica exhibited a rather high degree of cultural uniformity and in no cultural domain was this more true than in the realm of religion. There were regional variations, to be sure, but these were small, and thus one can speak of a pan- Mesoamerican religion. THE CULT OF THE DEAD AND RITUAL CANNIBALISM The main characteristics of this polytheistic system were as follows: a highly diversified and specialized pantheon in which hundreds of patron gods and goddesses for practically every human activity, natural phenomenon, and social grouping were arranged in a somewhat hierarchical order. A very complex and extensive ritual and ceremonial yearly cycle regulated by the calendrical system. A sophisticated cosmology and theology centered on the origins and nature of the gods, the creation of man and the universe, the regulation of man's relationship to the gods, and the disposition of the dead and afterlife. A religious ideology that emphasized pragmatism in the relationship between man and the supernatural at the expense of values and morality, which were almost exclusively an aspect of the social structure in operation. An extensive and well organized priesthood in charge of the administration of religion and several ancillary aspects of the social structure. A tremendous emphasis on human sacrifices to the gods and perhaps significant degree of ritual cannibalism. A pronounced concern with bloodshed and the dead, and a cult of the dead approaching ancestors worship. Mesoamerican religion pervaded every significant cultural domain of the City State or Ceremonial Center State; the social, the economic, the political, the administrative, and the military (Carrasco 1976:235-237). Indeed, as Caso (1945:82) remarked, religion was the driving force of Mesoamerican culture. In many distinct ways, however, Mesoamerican religion was rather similar to Old World polytheistic systems, such as those of Indo-Europeans, India, and China: the gods were made in the image of man and they exhibited the foibles, virtues, and vices of human beings; the gods were hierarchically arranged in an organized pantheon; religion was essentially a pragmatic ritualistic system regulating the relationship between man and the supernatural; the social structure of the gods mirrored that of ordinary humans, with whom they interacted in a variety of forms; and so on. It is interesting to note that Kirchhoff (1964a:73-100; 1964b:13-28) maintained that Mesoamerican polytheism was not an indigenous development but rather that it had diffused from the Old World, at least in embryonic form, and probably from Southeast Asia. This kind of diffusionism is almost impossible to prove scientifically (see Caso 1964:29-35) but Kirchhoff (1964a:73-100) makes a significant point by showing some of the structural similarities in the Chinese, Javanese, Hindu, and Mesoamerican pantheons and the correspondences and correlations of the gods. Regardless of whether Mesoamerican polytheism was an indigenous development or diffused from the Old World, it is important to keep in mind its similarities to Indo- European and Near Eastern polytheism, out of which Christianity arose.</page><page sequence="4">60 ETHNOLOGY There is no doubt that Mesoamerican religion exhibited a pronounced or even great concern with the dead. The belief system specified the disposition of the dead, the nature of the afterlife, and the relationship between the living and the dead. There was a significant amount of ritual and ceremonial activity surrounding the dead and what they meant for the living but whether this cult of the dead amounted to ancestors worship is difficult to say and depends, of course, on the definition of this religious domain. Unquestionably, however, the Mesoamerican cult of the dead was more intense than the Catholic cult of the dead introduced in New Spain by the mendicant friars. Just as significantly, the two complexes reached their ritual and ceremonial peak within two months of each other (including a sort of pre-Hispanic simile of All Saints Day, as discussed below) and had roughly equivalent symbolic, propitiatory, and intensifying functions. Describing the ritual and ceremonial activities throughout the thirteenth month (Tepeilhuitl) on the calendar of the Anahuac (Central Mexican Highlands), the Franciscan friar, Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:125) says: In honor of the mountains they used to manufacture snakes made of wood or tree roots and carved the heads in the shape of snakes; they also made long wooden sections as thick as a wrist, which they called ecatotonti. Both the snakes and the wooden sections they covered with that dough they call tzoal, while the latter they dressed to resemble mountains topped by a carved head in human form. They also made these images in memory of people who had drowned or died in such a fashion they did not cremate but buried. After having placed these images on their family altars with great ceremony they offered them tamales and other foods, and they also praised their deeds and drank wine in their honor (my translation). Later in his magnum opus, when he returns to the description of the festivities and sacrifices of Tepeilhuitl and again takes up the theme of the cult of the dead, Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:200) says: They also used to place the images of the dead on those grass wreaths. Then at dawn they put these images in their shrines, on top of beds of reed mace, sedge, or rush. Once the images were placed there they offered them food, tamales, and gruel or stew made of chicken [turkey] or dog's meat. Then they offered the images incense from an incense burner, which was a big cup full of coals, and this ceremony they called calonoac. And the rich sang and drank pulcre [fermented agave juice] in honor of these gods and their dead, while the poor offered them only food, as it has been mentioned (my translation). Describing the origin of idolatry and the cult of the dead in the pre- Hispanic Tlaxcalan Confederacy, the 16th century mestizo historian Mufioz Camargo (1948:153) says, "Prominent men began to make statues of distinguished individuals who died and whose memorable exploits and deeds benefited the Republic. The statues were a testimonial to their good and famous deeds. In time they came to be worshipped as gods" (my translation). Mufioz Camargo's information is sketchy, but what he says can be interpreted as a case of ancestors worship. I am not at all certain, however,</page><page sequence="5">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 61 that the pre-Hispanic Tlaxcalans practiced full-fledged ancestor worship. His categorical assertion is not corroborated by any independent ethnohistorical sources from the 16th century, the information for which was gathered mostly in the Valley of Mexico and the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley. There is no question that the Tlaxcalans, like most peoples in Mesoamerica, emphasized the cult of the dead but it did not necessarily amount to ancestors worship as a significant component of their religion. It is possible, of course, that Tlaxcalans did practice ancestors worship, but this is unlikely. Rather, I am of the opinion that Muftoz Camargo was exaggerating and misinterpreting this aspect (for example, the deification of the dead) of Tlaxcalan religion. He was the son of a distinguished Spanish conquistador and a Tlaxcalan Indian woman (Gibson 1952:195-208), probably of noble extraction. As a new Christian, as the saying goes, he wanted to be more Catholic than the pope. Thus he greatly exaggerated the pagan practices of the Indians' pre-Hispanic past in order to make them more abhorrent than they were. This is evident in what Munoz Camargo (1948:153) had to say concerning the consumption of human flesh in the same paragraph that describes ancestor worship: And thus the devil became stronger in order to truly take roots among such simple and untalented people. And the passions that existed among themselves led them to eat their own flesh in order to take vengeance upon their enemies, and rabidly the practice slowly became the custom of eating each other like demons. Thus, there were public butcher shops [or slaughters] of human flesh as there are today of beef and mutton (my translation). Munoz Camargo's holier-than-thou attitude is perhaps understandable but it lays bare the nature of his exaggeration, if not outright fabrication, in trying to enhance the great liberating influences of Catholicism in particular and Spanish culture in general, by portraying pre-Hispanic Tlaxcalans in the worst possible light. No serious scholar (except Eulalia Guzman) has ever denied that the ancient Mesoamericans practiced ritual cannibalism, the kind of cannibalism out of which Christian communion likely developed, and which was probably practiced in ancient Mesopotamia when an impersonator of the patron god of the city was ritually eaten by part of the congregation (Hastings 1951, Vol. 3:204-205 and Vol. 6:862-864; Frazer 1935, Vol. 8:325; see also Childe 1942:73-74 and 198-109; Sagan 1974:108-109). But there is no definitive or even fair evidence that Mesoamerican civilizations practiced gastronomic cannibalism. Sahagun's (1956) description of the cult of the dead on the eve of the Spanish Conquest is more complete than Munoz Camargo's and more reliable as well. Sahagun's thoroughness, reliability, and objectivity is undisputed among the 16th century scholars who wrote about pre-Hispanic culture and society. Indeed, the main reason why I think that Mesoamerican peoples in general, and those of the Central Mexican Highlands in particular, did not have a system of ancestors worship is that Sahagun describes the cult of the dead not as a separate complex but as part of the annual ritual and ceremonial cycle. I also agree with Carrasco (personal communication), who thinks that the Nahuatl peoples of Central Mexico did not have ancestors worship because they lacked lineages (and unilineal descent) to which the practice could be anchored, such as in the case of the royal Inca ayllus or</page><page sequence="6">62 ETHNOLOGY classical Roman society. At any rate, most 16th century sources concerned with one or more aspects of pre-Hispanic religion have something to say about the cult of the dead. It is therefore important to analyze in some detail the most important primary sources in order to gain a proper perspective on this significant aspect of pre-Hispanic religion. THE ETHNOHISTORICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE CULT OF THE DEAD Mufioz Camargo (1948) has only one reference to the cult of the dead. Sahagun (1956), on the other hand, mentions the cult of the dead several times, three of them extensively. First, as part of the rites of the fourteenth month or Quecholli, Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:203) describes accompanying ceremonies for the dead: During the fifth day they used to make small arrows in honor of the dead....and placed them on their graves; together they also placed a couple of sweet tamales. These offerings remained on the graves all day; at sunset the candlewood were lit, and on the spot the candlewood and arrows were burnt. The resulting charcoal and ashes were buried on the grave of the dead, in honor of those who had died in war (my translation). Second, during Izcalli, the eighteenth and last month of the year, Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:225) says: Every household used to offer to the fire five amaranth cakes [tamales] on a platter; they also made this offering to the dead, placing a tamale on each of the graves where they were buried. This ceremony took place before they partook of the tamales, and the remaining ones had to be eaten thereafter, for none could be saved for the following day (my translation). What is most significant in Sahagiin's treatment of the cult of the dead, as well as in all the 16th century sources described below, is that the rites and ceremonies of the complex are an integral part of the very elaborate annual cycle regulated by the calendrical system. Thus, Tepeilhuitl was the feast in honor of tutelary mountain owners, a complex designed to propitiate and intensify these supernaturals intimately associated with water, fertility, and the general agricultural cycle; Quecholli was a manifold celebration of rites and ceremonies in honor of Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, the gods of the hunt, and several agricultural deities with decidedly protective and propitiatory overtones; and Izcalli was dedicated mostly to the cult of the fire god, Xiuhtecutli or Huehueteotl; but it was also the time for thanksgiving and propitiation to the gods in general. It is sometimes difficult to determine the ritual and ceremonial fit of the cult of the dead into the general structure of the annual cycle. But given the nature of the worshipped gods and the propitiatory, intensifying, protective, and/or thanksgiving character of the functions and activities involved, it is possible to interpret the cult of the dead as it is manifested throughout the year. For example, the effigies and their symbolic simulacra (snakes, wooden sticks in the shape of hills) made of tzoalli (amaranth) dough, offered to tutelary mountain owners during the month of Tepeilhuitl, were also offered to the dead associated with water and the natural elements, unmistakably giving us the answer as to why these</page><page sequence="7">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 63 supernaturals and the dead were worshipped and propitiated jointly. Moreover, the time of celebrating and the supernatural associations of the cult of the dead are intimately tied to the disposition and destination of the dead. The Dominican friar Dur?n (1967) is another of the most important sources on pre-Hispanic religion. Again in the context of the calendrical annual cycle, Duran described two feasts of the dead. First, during the ninth month, Tlaxochimaco (Sahagun 1956, Vol. 1:119-120), the celebration of Miccailhuitontli took place, which Duran (1967, Vol. 1:269-270) translates "little feast of the dead," or "feast of the little dead." Duran identifies the feast as the celebration of those who had died young ("nifios inocentes," probably children who had died in infancy), describes it as a solemn occasion, when offerings and sacrifices were made in honor of dead children, and regards it as a preview of a similar celebration to come. The cult of the dead in the context of Miccailhuitontli is intimately associated with seeking supernatural protection against the sometimes devastating effects of hail on the maturing crops throughout the month of August and early September, which in pre-Hispanic times as well as today, could bring famine to entire communities in the Central Mexican Highlands. It is not clear in Duran's account how the propitiation of dead children was thought to achieve that objective but there can be little doubt that dead children acted as sympathetic devices (supernatural intermediaries, if you will) in order to protect the crops against hail. There is no other explanation for the fact that the most conservative Tlaxcalan communities until today keep the tombs of infants and children decorated profusely with flowers throughout the month of August. The people believe that infants and children can intercede on their behalf before El Cuatlapanga and La Malintzi, the most prominent tutelary mountain owners in the Tlaxcalan region, regarded as masters of the natural elements (hail, rain, thunder, lightning). Second, twenty days later, during the tenth month, Xocotl Huetzi, Duran (1967, Vol. 1:271-273) describes "La Fiesta Grande de los Muertos" (the great feast of the dead). He means, however, the feast of the adult dead, that other sources (Codice Telleriano-Remensis 1964:plate 4, 158) call Hueymiccaylhuitl. Duran (1967, Vol. 1:271) says, "The great feast of the dead, that took place in the tenth month, was celebrated on the 28th of August, according to our calendar. It was a very solemn and important day when many men were sacrificed" (my translation). He goes on to describe the ritual and ceremonial activities during the month and it is evident that, as far as the cult of the dead is concerned, it was a continuation of what transpired in the ninth month. It must be clearly understood, of course, that the twenty days of every month of the Mesoamerican calendar was an elaborate and diversified complex of rites and ceremonies to various gods and goddesses and related activities. Probably none of the eighteen months of the calendar can be said to have had a single, exclusive ritual and ceremonial theme. What is important to realize in this context is that the protective, and to some extent intensifying, activities initiated during the ninth month continued during the tenth (that is, throughout the entire month of August) and that the dead played a significant role in the proceedings. For example, during the first day of Miccailhuitontli a big, thick tree was cut down, its</page><page sequence="8">64 ETHNOLOGY bark removed, and its trunk made smooth. The tree, brought from the mountain, was left on the ground at the main entrance or access to the village or town. There it was received with music and dancing, remained in situ for twenty consecutive days, and the people made daily offerings of food and incense (copal). At the onset of Hueymiccaylhuitl, the tree (xocotl) was ceremonially lifted by the priests, taken to the main enclosure of the temple, and reverently erected. Then, a bird made of tzoalli dough was put on top of the tree and an elaborate offering of food and pulque (neutle, octli, fermented agave juice) was placed at the bottom. The ceremony lasted all day and was accompanied by much singing and dancing (Duran 1967, Vol. 1:269-273). Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:184-190) in addition, tells us that the xocotl was decorated with paper, implicitly suggesting that the tree took the form of a mountain, abutted by an actual effigy of the mountain's tutelary owner made of tzoalli dough. Undoubtedly other ritual and ceremonial activities took place during the month of Xocotl Huetzi but its most salient theme was to placate the forces of nature through the supernaturals that controlled them in order to ensure the successful maturing of the crops. This interpretation is reasonable in the light of contemporary ethnographic information. In at least three communities in Tlaxcala surrounding La Malintzi volcano, a ceremony still takes place that is unquestionably a survival of Xocotl Huetzi. On August 10 (the day of San Lorenzo [Saint Lawrence], the Christian name of El Cuatlapanga, the master of hail) the official tezitlazc (a supernatural practitioner endowed with powers to control the weather) of the community accompanied by several villagers climb half way to the El Cuatlapnaga hill to a large cave, where they leave an offering of flowers, candles, incense, food, and drink (Nutini 1968:81-82). From there, they go on to the mid-slopes of La Malintzi volcano, where they cut down a medium-size tree with two thick lower branches in the form of a cross. The bark of the tree is removed on the spot and the body of this natural cross is made smooth. With great care, the tree-cross is carried back to the village while the tezitlazc chants litanies in Nahuatl and Spanish invoking the name of El Cuatlapanga and San Lorenzo (the Christian patron saint of rain). A large group of people are awaiting on the outskirts of the community; the tree-cross is taken to the entrance of the cemetery where it is ceremonially erected. Immediately, the wife of the tezitlazc, with the help of volunteer women, decorate the tree-cross with colorful papier-mdche, and a plate of alegrias (candy squares or rectangles made of amaranth, sugar, and honey) is placed at the bottom. The decorated tree-cross and offering remains in situ for twenty days, at the end of which they are ceremonially burnt. Of the three or four most important primary sources on pre-Hispanic culture, Motolinia (1969; 1903) has the least information on the cult of the dead. But within the context of 16th century conversion and catechization, Motolinia (1969:25) gives us the only reference to the cult of the dead at that time: Besides these they had other days dedicated to the dead, when they mourned them, and, after eating and getting drunk, they would call the devil. This is what took place throughout these days: They buried and mourned the dead, and after twenty days, they mourned him again and placed</page><page sequence="9">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 65 food and flowers on his grave; and every eighty days they did the same until the end of the year [after his death]. For four consecutive years they made the offering and mourned him on the day of his death, after which he was never again remembered. As a means of availing themselves of their power of intercession, they called all dead persons teutl [sic teotl, god in Nahuatl], that is, god so- and-so, or saint so-and-so (my translation). Motolinia does not add much to what we can gather from the other primary sources, nor does he specify the dates when the dead were worshipped (see Sahagun 1956, Vol. 1:293-298). But the last sentence of the above quotation is extremely important in understanding the cult of the dead and the place it had in pre-Hispanic religion. In 1945, the journal Tlalocan published a manuscript from the Escorial palace library entitled, "Costumbres, Fiestas, Enterramientos y Diversas Formas de Proceder de los Indios de Nueva Espana" (Gomez de Orozco 1971). Its author is unknown but the manuscript is dated 1553 and probably comes from the Texcoco region. It contains much information on religion and one significant reference to the cult of the dead: They used to celebrate the feast of the dead, because they offered in their honor to the devil [god or gods] many turkeys, corn, blankets, clothing, food, and many other things. In particular, every household celebrated a great feast. They incensed the images that they had of their dead parents, kinsmen, and priests, and drawing blood [by pricking themselves with agave thorns] from their tongues, ears, legs, arms, and pudenda, they rubbed the idols of their ancestors and covered them with paper. Every year they did the same, and the blood and paper was a yearly reminder for how long they had remembered the dead (G6mez de Orozco 1971:42) (my translation). This feast of the dead took place during the fifth month, Toxcatl, dedicated primarily to Tezcatlipoca, the principal god, and secondarily to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. Although a month may have included different activities, the main theme of the ritual and ceremonial activity throughout this month was centered on "asking the gods for water," as Dur&amp;n (1967, Vol. 1:255) clearly indicates. Toxcatl fell at the end of the dry season, when the rains are about to begin (it began on the 23rd of April, according to Sahagun [1956, Vol. 1:114]; a day earlier, according to the manuscript under consideration; and on the 5th day of May, according to the Codice Borbonico, as established by Caso (1939:27; 1971:11-45). As the meaning of this month (dryness and lack of water) in Nahuatl indicates, the main thrust of the activity was unmistakably a complex of propitiating and intensifying rites and ceremonies designed tb hasten the arrival of the rainy season and to ask the deities of water and corn for plentiful crops. There are no specific statements in the primary sources as to how the dead fit into this complex but here again we may surmize that, as in the case of the Miccailhuitontli- Hueymiccaylhitl, the dead acted in some sort of intermediary supernatural role. But the cult of the dead during the month of Toxcatl also obeyed other theological and cosmological reasons, as Carrasco (1979:52-61) brilliantly demonstrates in his analysis of the ritual calendar of Central Mexico. Among the partly pictorial sources on pre-Hispanic religion, the Codice Telleriano-Remensis (1964) is particularly important for our purposes. In its account of the fixed celebrations in the calendrical cycle there are two</page><page sequence="10">66 ETHNOLOGY references to the cult of the dead that correspond exactly to Duran's little feast of the dead and great feast of the dead. The Codice Telleriano- Remensis, however, expands what Duran has to say, and this warrants a detailed account. First, the feast of Miccaylhuitl (Duran's Miccailhuitontli) is described as follows: The feast of the dead begins on the third of August. During this feast, offerings of food and drink were made to the dead on their graves. They did this for four consecutive years because they believed that throughout this period the souls of the dead did not reach their final resting place. Thus, the dead were buried fully dressed, because they believed that until arriving at their final destination, at the end of four years, the souls underwent much toil, cold, and fatigue and passed through places covered with snow and thorns (Codice Telleriano-Remensis 1964:156, plate III; see also Sahagun 1956, Vol. 1:293-298) (my translation). This account gives us additional information concerning the cult of the dead during the ninth month of the year but, unlike Duran's, does not particularly associate it with the cult of dead children. The interpreter of this codex, Jose Corona Nufiez, goes on to say that this celebration of the dead is similar to the feast of the dead among contemporary Mexican Indians. Unfortunately, he does not identify the contemporary Indians or in what ways the cults of the dead are similar. Second, the Codice Telleriano-Remensis describes practices concerning the cult of the dead during the tenth month that are not found in any of the main sources: This feast begins on the twenty-third of August. During this month they celebrated again the feast of the dead, which was much more important than the previous one.... Throughout the last three days of this month, the living fasted in honor of the dead and they rejoiced by going to the fields to play. Every year, when they celebrated the feast of the dead, and while the priests made sacrifices, all the people, each one in his own house, climbed to the roof. Facing north, they fervently prayed to their own kin, entreating them with the words: "come quickly for we are waiting for you" (C6dice Telleriano-Remensis 1964:158, plate IV) (my translation). This feast of the dead was the most salient and elaborate of various similar feasts throughout the annual cycle. During the thirteenth month, Ueypachtli (Tepeilhuitl in Sahagun), the Codice Telleriano-Remensis reports a relevant fact. "This was the feast of humbling [oneself, do penance?]. On this occasion they celebrated the feasts of all their gods, or, as one would say, the feast of all saints" (Codice Telleriano-Remensis 1964:164, plate VII) (my translation). The meaning of "the great feast of humbling" or "doing penance" (as an alternative interpretation) is obscure and I find no clues in any of the primary sources. Nor are there any references or clues as to whether, in fact, there was such a feast of all gods. The implications of this quandry are obvious for the process of syncretism that follows the Spanish Conquest, as I discuss elsewhere (Nutini 1988:Chapter 11). A possible explanation of the above passage is that the original interpreter or interpreters of the codex misconstrued the large number of gods (Tlaloc, his acolytes, the tlaloque, many tutelary mountain owners [Popocatepetl,</page><page sequence="11">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 67 Iztaccihuatl, Matlalcueye, etc], and other gods and goddesses) celebrated throughout the month of Tepeilhuitl as a general celebtation of the entire polytheistic pantheon. (Or as Carrasco [personal communication] suggests, the Nahuatl glosses teotl eco or teteo eco [the gods arrive] may have been translated as todos santos. (Indirectly, the interpreter of this codex's plate also refers to the gods as abogados [intercessors] and angeles de la guarda [guardian angels], which is a good theological and cosmological interpretation of the deities.) Equating Tepeilhuitl with a kind of feast of all saints is a rather bad analogy but indicates that, some 30 years after the onset of conversion, most Indians in central Mexico, and educated Indians in particular, had been significantly influenced by Catholic beliefs and practices. I detect the same bias in Duran (1967: Vol. 1, 269-270), certainly in Munoz Camargo (1948), but not in Sahagun (1956) and Motolinia (1903, 1969), who are more objective in separating their own beliefs from what their informants told them or what they observed. Finally, a brief look at the modern literature. Two anthropologists particularly, Kirchhoff and Carrasco, deal with the cult of the dead in their analyses of the primary sources. In an analysis of the pre-Hispanic ritual and ceremonial cycle, Kirchhoff (1972:199-204) mentions all but one of the dated feasts of the dead that I have culled from Sahagun, Duran, "Costumbres de Nueva Espana," and Codice Telleriano-Remensis: those that take place during the months of Toxcatl, Tlaxochimaco, Xocotl Huetzi, Tepeilhuit, and Quecholli. He does not mention Sahagun's description of the ceremonies for the dead during the month of Izcalli but he does mention another feast of the dead that took place during the month of Tititl (see Codex Magliabecchi 1903: plate 45). Kirchhoff does not cite the source of his information but it is possible that this is only one feast of the dead that took place either during Tititl or Izcalli, depending on what month the Mesoamerican year began. Carrasco (1979:52-61; 1976:235-288), on the other hand, briefly discusses the cult of the dead during Toxcatl, Tlaxochimaco, Xocotl Huetzi, Quecholli, and Tititl but very ably places the complex within the context of the cosmology, social structure, and natural environment of pre-Hispanic religion. His interpretation of the annual calendrical cycle makes the propitiatory, protective, and intensifying aspects of the cult of the dead perfectly intelligible. The other aspects of the cult of the dead must be explained in terms of theology and cosmology, and in this respect Carrasco has also placed the problem in the proper perspective. CALENDRICAL, THEOLOGICAL, AND COSMOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS Let us now establish the dates of the feasts of the dead throughout the annual calendrical cycle according to the European calendar. For reasons that are not the concern of this article (see Carrasco 1979:52-61) it should be understood that the dates are approximate but more than sufficiently accurate for our purposes. It is impossible to date Munoz Camargo's (1948) reference to the cult of the dead. His statement that distinguished men were remembered in statuary form is highly doubtful; with the possible exception of the Maya of Yucatan (Landa 1966:59-60), Mesamericans apparently never</page><page sequence="12">68 ETHNOLOGY had such a practice. Munoz Camargo obtained the wrong information or he misinterpreted what he was told. Very likely, he confused the tzoalli dough images offered to the dead with actual statues, presumably made of stone, ceramic, or wood. If this is the case, Munoz Camargo is possibly referring to the feast of the dead during the month of Tepeilhuitl. Neither can I date Motolinia's reference. There are indications, however, that he is referring to the great feast of the dead that took place during the month of Xocotl Huetzi. The other six references to the cult of the dead discussed above can be dated with no difficulty in the sources themselves but not with respect to the European calendar. The sources do not agree as to the beginning of each Mesoamerican month (and the exact date of some of the feasts thereof). For example, Sahagun places the beginning of the Mesoamerican year on February 2 (Candlemas), Duran on March 1, while the Codice Telleriano- Remensis appears (the first six plates of the original codex are lost) to place it on February 24. Suffice it to say that the appropriate correlations given by the sources themselves are sufficiently accurate for description and analysis. Following Carrasco (1976:274-279), I shall also indicate the correlation established by Caso (1939) with respect to the Julian year of 1519. In the usual chronological order of the months, beginning with Atlacahualo, the Nahuatl-speaking peoples of the Central Mexican Highlands worshipped, celebrated, and sacrificed to the dead on the following dates: (1) During the fifth month of Toxcatl: April 22 to May 11, according to "Costumbres, Fiestas, Enterramientos y Diversas Formas de Proceder de los Indios de Nueva Espana" (Gomez de Orozco 1971:42); May 5 to May 24, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). The feast of the dead probably took place during the first two or three days of the month. (2) During the ninth month of Tlaxochimaco: August 8 to August 27, according to Durdn (1967, Vol. 1:269); August 3 to August 22, according to Codice Telleriano-Remensis (1964:156, plate III); 24 July to August 12, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). The main rites and ceremonies to the dead took place during the first day of the month. (3) During the tenth month of Xocotl Huetzi: August 28 to September 17, according to Duran (1967, Vol. 1:271); August 23 to September 12, according to Codice Telleriano-Remensis (1964:148, plate IV); August 13 to September 1, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). The main rites and ceremonies to the dead took place during the last three days of the month. (4) During the thirteenth month of Tepeilhuitl: September 30 to October 19, according to Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:125); October 12 to 31, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). (5) During the fourteenth month of Quecholli: October 20 to November 8, according to Sahagun (1956: Vol. 1:126); November 1 to November 20, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). The high point of the cult of the dead appeared to have fallen on the fifth day of the month. (6) During the seventeenth month of Tititl: Kirchhoff (1972:199-204) does not give a date, but following Caso (Carrasco 1979:61), the feast of the dead should have fallen between December 31 and January 19 (?). (7) During the eighteenth month of Izcalli: January 8 to January 27, according to Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:131); 25 January to February 13, according to Caso (Carrasco 1979:61). The offerings to the dead seemed to</page><page sequence="13">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 69 have extended throughout the month, until the end of the solar year with its five extra days. This ritual and ceremonial calendar is a composite picture of the cult of the dead among the Nahuatl peoples of Central Mexico, for the information of the original sources comes from several regions (but mostly from the Valley of Mexico and the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley) and no two accounts are exactly alike. There is no doubt, however, that the account given above constitutes a good common denominator of the cult of the dead, not only for Central Mexico but for most of Mesoamerica. On the other hand, it is obviously beyond the scope of this article to go into the cosmological, theological, and social elaborations and complexities of the cult of the dead within the Mesoamerican polytheistic system (Carrasco 1976; Caso 1958; Lopez Austin 1973; Soustelle 1955). But two theological and cosmological aspects of the cult of the dead must be discussed in order to understand, and to some degree explain, the cult's position in pre-Hispanic polytheism and the process of syncretism that it underwent during the first 150 years after the Conquest. Carrasco (1976:235-257) demonstrates that the structure and social organization of the pre-Hispanic peoples of Central Mexico and that of their polytheistic pantheon was one and the same; they were governed by the same principles, there was no categorical distinction between the living and the dead, and many aspects and forms of human behavior are replicated in supernatural behavior. Moreover, the destination of the dead and the supernatural attributes of humans are essential in order to understand pre- Hispanic polytheism and the ritual and ceremonial that went with it. In the supernatural belief system of Central Mexico, there was fundamentally no distinction between cosmology and theology; the origins of the gods and the world, the provenance of man, his trajectory on earth, his relationship to the gods, and his final destination are basically a single normative system. It is in this context that the cult of the dead must be interpreted and explained. In this conception of the universe, humans are created by the gods, they go through life in intimate ritual and ceremonial contact with their creators, and they join them in their final destination. The structure and social organization of eartlhy life is mirrored in the aftermath, where the dead go to serve their creators (Carrasco 1976:235-241). (It should be noted that humans originated in Omeyocan [the realm of the creation couple], Ometeuctli [The Lord of Our Flesh] and Omecihuatl [The Lady of Corn]. With theological license, however, one may regard all the gods in the pantheon as the creators of man.) As servants of the gods in the afterlife, the dead are at the same time men and gods. It is in this sense that Motolinia (1969:25) hints at the deification of the dead, suggesting in passing that the dead become intermediaries in the relationship between man and the gods and not as gods in their own right as implied by Mufioz Camargo (1948:153). Extending the analogy, Carrasco (1977:12) says, "Moreover, the gods have different ranks corresponding to those in human society. Just as there are lords (teteuctin), each one of whom has a court of nobles and servants, the main gods are also teuctli of different spaces [domains] of the universe, each one with a retinue of gods of lesser rank in attendance. The deified dead go to one of the residences of the main</page><page sequence="14">70 ETHNOLOGY gods, where they become members of his [or her] court" (my translation). But what were the criteria that determined the final destination of the dead or, more specifically, in what supernatural domain were they destined to become deified servants of a main god or gods? According to the circumstances of each person's death, is the answer. In other words, since each supernatural domain had a god or gods that ruled over it (which were also the patrons of specific social, religious, economic, and practically of every conceivable human activity), one can conceive of death as the method of recruiting humans to serve in the retinues of the gods (Carrasco 1976:248). I can thus explain the seven occasions of the cult of the dead culled from the sources cited above (and possibly several other occasions not reported in the sources) in terms of rites and ceremonies of remembrance in honor of those who had died under particular circumstances or occasions, the dates of which were determined by the feasts of the patron gods of the dead's final destinations. Theoretically, it is possible that there were as many celebrations of the dead throughout the year as there were identifiable ways of dying marked by patron gods. In practice, however, it appears that only the most socially salient, and obviously prevalent, ways of dying were celebrated. Under such conditions, and given the general characteristic of societies in Central Mexico, one would expect celebrations for those who had died of natural causes, in childhood, in battle, as the result of natural elements, and perhaps in the context of other social, biological, or natural activities. Let us examine the seven celebrations of the dead that I have identified. The cult of the dead during the fifth month of Toxcatl was associated with the feast of Texcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli. But the main theme of the month seems to have been the hastening of the rainy season and thus the celebrations were concerned also with the propitiations of the gods of water, rain, and in general those of the agricultural cycle. There are then three possibilities, but what dead were celebrated during this feast remains ambiguous. They could have been those who went to serve Tezcatlipoca in the ninth heaven (one of the thirteen upper levels of supra world of the Nahuatl universe). They could have been those who died in battle and who then became companions of Huitzilopochtli. And they could have been those who died as a result of the natural elements and possibly went to reside in Tlalocan, the realm of Tlaloc, the god of rain, and his acolytes. The original sources are not detailed or systematic enough to enable us to give a categorical answer. The little feast of the dead (Miccailhuitontli) that took place on the ninth month of Tlaxochimaco evidently celebrated dead children, as the name indicates. Although other important gods, such as Teacatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, and cihuacoatl (goddess of earth) were also worshipped, the protective and intensifying activities of this month seem to have been centered on those who died young. As Carrasco (1976:251) puts it, "Children who died in infancy went to Tonacacuauhtitlan, Tree of sustenance,' located in the heaven of the creation couple, the Lord and Lady of Sustenance. This was a place where all kinds of trees and fruits grew abundantly, and the souls of the children in the form of hummingbirds went about sucking flowers" (my translation). The sources do not specify why dead children joined the creation couple but one can surmize that those who died before achieving a</page><page sequence="15">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 71 social persona were returned to the place inhabited by the supernaturals who had given them the initial life impulse. The great feast of the dead (Hueymiccaylhuitl) was celebrated at the beginning of the tenth month of Xocotl Huetzi. As I have already discussed, the protective and intensifying rites and ceremonies of the ninth month were continued throughout the tenth month and, in the usual fashion, in connection with celebrations to a number of other gods such as Xiuhtecutli (god of fire) and Painal (lieutenant god of war). Although none of the sources cited above mentions the name of Mictlantecutli, the god of hell, it is evident that Hueymiccaylhuitl celebrates the dead who joined this lord in his infra-world. This is clear in the description of the Codice Telleriano- Remensis (1964:158, plate IV), when the living, on the roof of their houses facing north, prayed to the dead and beckoned them to return. The implication here is that the north was associated with hell as well as a series of infra-worlds. Indiviauls who died of natural causes (i.e., of old age or as a result of normal illnesses) went to Mictlan or hell, literally "place of the dead." It should be emphasized that hell did not have any of the connotations of the Christian hell, given the essentially pragmatic nature of pre-Hispanic religion and the fact that transgressions against the moral order were punished in this world and not in the afterlife. Mictlan was located in the lowest level of the nine infra-worlds. It was ruled by Mictlantecutli and his wife Mictecacihuatl and their court included other gods of hell as well as those who had died and were destined to it. The dead were cremated and their souls embarked on a long and arduous journey that lasted four years before reaching their final destination. (This evinces a very interesting similarity to the journey of the dead in Greek mythology, with dog, river, and other elaborations.) The recurring offerings to the dead (Motolinia 1969:25; Codice Telleriano-Remensis 1964:156, plate III) until the fourth anniversary are obviously rites of intensification designed to help them in their difficult journey. The dead lived in hell in the same fashion as they had lived on earth and that is why they were buried with the instruments, utensils, or insignia of their earthly status. From hell, they return to earth once a year for the feast of Hueymiccaylhuitl, as described in the Codice Telleriano-Remensis (Carrasco 1976:248-249). This must be regarded as the high point of the cult of the dead in the annual cycle and it is so regarded by Duran and the Codice Telleriano-Remensis. The reason is simple. Since in any stable society the overwhelming majority of people dies of old age or normal illnesses, it stands to reason that Mictlan was by far the most common final destination for the dead and, just on the basis of numbers, it evidently required the greatest degree of ritual and ceremonial elaboration. There are no indications in the sources, whether the many other kinds of dead returned once a year to visit the living, and this alone would mark the Hueymiccaylhuitl as the pinnacle of the cult of the dead throughout the year. The cult of the dead during the thirteenth month of Tepeilhuitl blends in with the feast of tutelary mountain owners and the gods of water and rain and their acolytes. More than in several other months, the general theme of this celebration is water and the agricultural cycle; probably a thanksgiving complex for the crops about to be harvested and propitiatory rites for the coming agricultural cycle. Clearly, this month celebrated those dead who</page><page sequence="16">72 ETHNOLOGY went to join the realm of the god of rain (water). All those who died by drowning, or who went as the result of leprosy and dropsy (illnesses that were believed to be caused by the gods of water and rain), and possibly other water-related kinds of deaths, went to Tlalocan, the domain of Tlaloc, where he ruled assisted by his acolytes, the tlaloque. Moreover, some humans sacrificed to the gods also went to Tlalocan. Unlike those who died of natural causes, those who died as a result of water-related causes were buried with the typical insignia of the gods of rain. Tlalocan was located in the first heaven, just above the surface of the earth, but it was also believed that the gods of rain inhabited the summit of mountains, which were regarded as great depositories of water: hence the close association between the gods of water and rain and tutelary mountain owners. The mendicant friars compared Tlalocan to the Garden of Eden, a place with abundant water, full of flowers, and plenty of food (Carrasco 1976:249-250). Thus, for reasons given above, Tlalocan cannot in any way be compared with the Christian heaven. The ritual and ceremonial activity concerning water and fertility continued during the fourteenth month of Quecholli but the main theme now was centered on Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. Sahagun (1956, Vol. 1:203) is explicit about what dead were celebrated during the fifth day of this month; those who had died in battle. The warriors who died in battle or who were sacrificed to the gods and women who had died in childbirth went to reside in one of the heavens or supra worlds occupied by the sun. Individuals who were equated with warriors, such as merchants who died in the course of long-trading expeditions, or others who performed as warriors, such as wantons (a kind of prostitute who accompanied men into battle) who died in battle, also went to the realm of the sun (Carrasco 1976:253). The sources do not specify who was the lord of this realm but one may surmize that it was one of the manifestations of Tonatiuh, the sun god. I do not know exactly how Huitzilopochtli fit into this picture. What dead were celebrated during the seventeenth month of Tititl and the eighteenth month of Izcalli is not clear. During Tititl, the following gods were feasted: Ilamatecutli (the old goddess); Cihuacoatl; and Mictlantecutli. Dead primiparae also appeared to have been celebrated. These various ritual and ceremonial activities suggest several possibilities. Most likely, however, the dead remembered during this month were those that went to Tlalocan and/or Mictlan. Much the same can be said about the cult of the dead during Izcalli, for it involved multiple feasts but with an emphasis on the gods associated with hell (Xiuhtecutli, Ayauhmictlan). THE SYMBOLIC AND FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CULT OF THE DEAD In a sense, this exercise of trying to pinpoint the kinds of dead celebrated throughout the annual cycle is redundant. I could simply say that every feast in honor of every particular god or goddess throughout the annual cycle involved the cult of the dead. Theoretically, this is what the theology and cosmology of pre-Hispanic religion specified; that is, those who died were destined to join the supernatural court of the god or goddess under whose</page><page sequence="17">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 73 sign, patronage, or association, people departed from the society of men. In other words, there were as many kinds of dead that could possibly be remembered throughout the annual cycle as there were patron gods of human functions and activities. In practice, however, there were too many to be remembered properly and the people obviously concentrated on the most important contexts in which people died. These, then, are the contexts for the cult of the dead reported in the sources and possibly others that are not reported. The four or five most important occasions for the cult of the dead are well documented and, as one would expect of societies with cultural characteristics found in pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, they are the following: those who died of natural causes (obviously); those who were sacrificed, died in battle, and died in symbolically related activities (as befitted societies so much concerned with bloodshed and death); those who died in connection with water, the natural elements, and symbolically related activities (as befitted eminently agricultural societies); and, possibly, those who died young. I have theoretically and cosmologically explained the central place of the cult of the dead and identified the occasions throughout the annual cycle when the dead were celebrated. But there is more to this complex than the theology and cosmology of Mesoamerican religion specifies. Although the sources do not explicitly state, it is implicitly suggested that the dead served as intermediaries between man and the supernatural and embodied significant elements of protection, propitiation, intensification, and thanksgiving. I have touched upon some of these aspects but they merit a closer scrutiny. This is especially important for the analysis of the syncretic process entailed by the conversion to Catholicism after the Spanish Conquest, in which the theological and cosmological underpinnings of the pre-Hispanic cult of the dead were largely forgotten but functional and symbolic elements were perpetuated in a number of rites and ceremonies throughout the year, most explicitly centered in Todos Santos. Part human and part divine, the dead were a natural link between man and the gods. When the dead joined the deities to whom they were destined, they became the intermediaries between the natural and supernatural worlds of existence. Thus, one can conceive the cult of the dead as a means through which humans used these demigods as mediators in their innumerable supplications to the gods during the annual cycle. In many ways, the dead in pre-Hispanic polytheism are structural equivalents of the saints in Catholicism; personages without any supernatural power in their own right intercede on behalf of men before the Almighty God or powerful gods. This is clearly the intent when Motolinia (1969:25) describes the deification of the dead and suggests that they function as intercessors on behalf of man. When he equates the deified dead as kinds of saints, his analogy could not have been more appropriate. Theoretically, then, one can again infer that every feast in honor of the gods entailed the cult of their dead servants as a means to achieve the protective, propitiatory, intensifying, or any other aim implicit or explicit in the rites and ceremonies. In practice, obviously, this happened only for the most important human activities of the yearly cycle but it is very likely that there was a private cult of the dead in which individuals and families invoked their own dead, as suggested by several of the sources</page><page sequence="18">74 ETHNOLOGY discussed here. It is primarily the private cult of the dead that survived conversion to Catholieism, while its public aspects were almost totally replaced by the ritual and ceremonialism of the Church. The protective, propitiatory, intensifying, and thanksgiving functions of the cult of the dead are evidently a corollary of its mediating position between man and the supernatural but they are more explicitly exemplified in the sources. For each one of the seven occasions that I have identified in the sources we can infer the functional assignment of the cult of the dead. But it is in connection with the control of the natural elements that this assignment is most clearly and unmistakably inferred. This is the case with the cult of the dead during the month of Toxcatl and the feasts of Miccailhuitontli and Hueymiccaylhuitl, in which the central concern was asking for water and rain and the protection of the crops against hail. In a similar fashion, the cult of the dead during the months of Tepeilhuitl and Quecholli can be identified as thanksgiving and supplicatory activities in connection with the agricultural cycle. The association of dead children with fertility and the agricultural cycle is evident in the practice of burying children next to the storage bin. Moreover, in the thirteenth heaven of the creation couple, according to one account, there stood the Chichihualcuahuitl ("The Sucking Tree") that fed children who had died in infancy (Carrasco 1976: 251). This aspect of the pre-Hispanic cult of the dead is very important, for several of the beliefs and practices associated with it have survived until today, sometimes fairly intact and independent of Catholieism, sometimes modified and as part of Catholic beliefs and practices. Finally, I will briefly discuss an ancillary aspect of pre-Hispanic ritual and ceremonialism that appears often in connection with the cult of the dead; the symbolic use of amaranth. This is a widely distributed plant in the New World and at the arrival of the Europeans it had been domesticated in several areas, from Southern Chile to Northern Mexico. There were apparently three main species of amaranth cultivated in Mesoamerica at the time of the Conquest: Amaranthus Hypochondriacus; Amaranthus Cruentus; and Chenopodium Nuttalliae (Verdoorn 1945:20). The Nahuatl name for amaranth is huauhtli but most of the original sources refer to it as bledos in Spanish. Huauhtli can be identified as Amaranthus Hypochondriacus and it was apparently cultivated extensively in Central Mexico. It is a tall, leafy, red- flowered, small-grained plant that is still cultivated in some parts of Mexico and not infrequently found semi-wild. Although it never became a staple (as another species of amaranth, quinoa [Chenopodium Quinoa], did in parts of the Andean Area and the Central Valley of Chile), huauhtli was an important nutrient in pre-Hispanic times. For example, the Codex Mendoza tells us that perhaps as much as 200,000 bushels of huauhtli were paid to Moctezuma's palace (Williams 1981:9-10). It is not known for certain how much huauhtli was consumed as a daily item of diet but we know a good deal about how, when, and under what circumstances it was used ritually and ceremonially. Huauhtli obviously had significant magical and symbolic meaning for pre-Hispanic peoples and one gets the impression that it served as a means of communion with the gods. There are innumerable references in the sources to the use of huauhtli (Duran 1967, Vol. 1:28, 76, 119, 123, 156, 165; Gomez de Orozco 1971:47, 51, 52; Sahagun 1956, Vol. 1:125, 185,</page><page sequence="19">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 75 200, 203), which was an essential ingredient of many rites and ceremonies to the gods in the annual cycle. Both the flowers and grains of huauhtli were used: the red flowers for coloring ceremonial foodstuffs and other paraphernalia; the grains were eaten or they were utilized themselves as the main ingredient of the tzoalli dough. The main forms in which huauhtli was employed on countless occasions throughout the annual cycle are the following: in tzoalli dough (other ingredients were corn of different textures, chili peppers, and sometimes honey); for the manufacture of effigies of the gods, tutelary mountain owners, and other sacra; by itself for similar purposes; as the main ingredient of tamales for various ceremonial offerings; as the main ingredient for ceremonial meals eaten in connection with particular feasts to the gods; and in mortuary rites, such as putting grains on the faces of the dead destined for Tlalocan. Durdn (1967, Vol. 1:119) says explicitly that the effigies made of tzoalli dough embodied the flesh and bones of the gods, suggesting that when the people ate the dough (generally after an important feast) they were taking communion (see also Motolinia 1969:19). But why was huauhtli so important symbolically, ritually, and ceremonially? I do not have an answer and can only speculate. We know that huauhtli is an extremely nutritious grain, that it was the crop that was harvested earliest in the agricultural cycle, and its red flowers could have been a symbol for blood and death. These, and other piecemeal data suggest that huauhtli was a fertility symbol, a good conductor in communicating with the gods, and the prime element in whatever transubstantiation was involved in pre-Hispanic theology. The mendicant friars were quick to understand the symbolic importance of huauhtli, which led to its elimination as a crop by the Spanish authorities. But huauhtli survived and retained some of its magical and symbolic properties in several sectors of Mexican society until today. CONCLUSIONS The cult of the dead among the Nahuatl-speaking peoples of Central Mexico was an integral part of their theology and cosmology and occupied a central position in the ritual and ceremonial life of the annual cycle. The dead were worshipped and feasted as intermediaries between man and the gods, propitiated as means of protection and intensification, and in rather intimate contact with the living. The relationship involved an elaborate set of activities of a public and private nature on many occasions throughout the year. The belief system specified patterns of interaction between the living and the dead; the kinds of offerings, the return of the dead, the organization of specific activities, and perhaps what was expected of both sides of the equation. It is this complex that came to interact with the Spanish-Catholic cult of the dead throughout the first part of Colonial times and became syncretized largely in the Todos Santos celebration. The implications of the pre-Hispanic cult of the dead, together with its Spanish-Catholic counterparts, are thoroughly discussed elsewhere (Nutini 1988). The ensuing syncretic process is analyzed as a spontaneous (as opposed to guided) occurrence, largely independent of the mendicant friars and other religious and secular authorities, that coalesces by the late 17th century. In the contemporary setting, the cult of the dead is described and</page><page sequence="20">76 ETHNOLOGY analyzed in the full range of its structural, ideological, expressive, and symbolic implications. The religious, social, economic, political, demographic, and recreational underpinnings of the cult of the dead are analyzed by themselves and with reference to the cult of the saints and the overall folk religion. What emerges out of this global analysis of the cult of the dead is a new conception of magic and religion in Mesoamerican ethnology. Although the generalizations presented in this article apply primarily to the Central Mexican Highlands and Tlaxcala respectively, even assuming a significant degree of regional variation, the foregoing analysis may still serve as a model for the study of the cult of the dead in Mesomaerica generally. Whether the cult of the dead is studied in Yucatan, Oaxaca, or Michoacan, the approach inherent in this model emphasizes the ideology, theology, and teleology of the cult of the dead; domains that have been almost totally disregarded in the study of Mesoamerican magic and religion. The cult of the dead is a significant aspect of many religious systems throughout the world at all levels of evolutionary develoment, and this study may prove useful to the analysis of the phenomenon in cross-cultural perspective. This is particularly the case in the conceptualization of the religious changes brought about by the confrontation of Christianity and folk religious systems since the end of the Middle Ages. NOTES 1. Religion is one of the best known aspects of Mesoamerican culture at the time of the Conquest. The mendicant friars left a valuable record of pre-Hispanic politheism and the place of religion in Mesoamerican culture (Duran 1967; Landa 1966; Motolonfa 1903, 1969; Sahagun 1956). The legacy has been substantially augmented by much archeological and ethnohistorical scholarship (Seler 1923; Caso 1945, 1958; Vaillant 1941; Carrasco 1976; L6pez Austin 1973). 2. The Mesoamerican calendar, (xihuitl in Nahuatl) was composed of eighteen months of twenty days each with five extra days, for a total of 365 days. It was obviously an approximation and we still do not know whether Mesoamericans knew the concept of the leap year. The situation is further complicated by the fact that, although this calendar was almost universal in Mesoamerica, it did not always begin in the same month or even day of the month. This has resulted in some confusion in the interpretation and correlation of dates in the annual cycle of rites and ceremonies. For the purpose of the present discussion this connsideration is not entirely relevant but I do try to pinpoint dates as accurately as possible. 3. The Spanish word carniceria meant both "slaughter" and "butcher shop" in the 16th century (as it does today). Thus, the last part of this quotation is ambiguous. In view of the concluding words, "como en el dia de hoy las hay" (as there are today), "butcher shop" is the more likely meaning. 4. The structural and functional similarities of the pre-Hispanic xocotl and the tree-cross needs no belaboring. What is extremely interesting is the persistence of ritual forms and contents within the context of Catholieism in Tlaxcala and several other regions of Mesoamerica. During the past 25 years, I have recorded hundreds of such survivals in the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley, the Sierra de Puebla, and the Cordoba-Orizaba region. They are found primarily in the domain of the social structure in its wider context. The composite and quantitative analysis of surviving pre-Hispanic practices, sometimes in fairly pristine form, sometimes heavily influenced by Catholieism, has not been undertaken for Mesoamerica as a whole nor for any of its regions. The closest to this ideal is what has been done for witchcraft and sorcery in rural Tlaxcala by Nutini and Roberts</page><page sequence="21">CULT OF THE DEAD IN MESOAMERICA 77 (forthcoming). Such an analysis is essential to a full understanding of the process of syncretism and acculturation that Indian cultures and societies have been undergoing for 450 years. With respect to the area in question, beliefs and practices that have survived external pressures for more than four centuries are now on the verge of total disappearance. 5. Carrasco's publications (1976:235-288; 1977:11-17; 1979:52-61) on pre-Hispanic religion is outstanding and provides a thorough understanding of the social, cosmological, theological, and environmental foundations of the cult of the dead. I am indebted to him for directing me to several sources on this subject. BIBLIOGRAPHY Carrasco, P. 1976. La Sociedad Mexican antes de la Conquista.
