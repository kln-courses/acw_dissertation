<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOREST SUCCESSION AND SILVICULTURE IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND 1 The title of Lutz' bulletin, "Trends and Silvicultural Significance of Upland Forest Successions in Southern New England," shows at once that we have the results of an ecological investigation applied to forestry practice. Bibliographers and those who have been troubled with ambiguous titles-and who has not been-will appreciate this.2 The author devotes a page to definitions of ecological terms, thereby helping the uninitiated, and avoiding the common pitfall of loose terminology. He has used Nichols' classification, which the reviewer considers more work- able and better adapted to applications of ecology in forestry than any other. Nichols' long and close contact with the faculty and students of the Yale Forest School has given him an exceptional opportunity to under- stand the needs of the forester; and he has made the most of that oppor- tunity in rendering ecology useful to foresters; and at the same time has developed ecological concepts which stand the test of practical experience. The use of retrogressive successions (p. IO and elsewhere) may be criti- cized by those who believe that there is no such thing, in spite of Cooper's detailed description of a case of retrogression. Lutz is, however, not con- sidering retrogression through the slow operation of natural forces, but human activities ("anthropeic influences ") which bring about a lower de- velopmental stage through cutting or fire. 1 Lutz, Harold J.

Ecologists may regret the omission, but can not deny that it has resulted in a simple, well' coordinated bulletin, which can be more readily understood and used than would have been possible with a fuller treatment. All of the successions considered are secondary. The primary successions, on talus slopes, alluvial and marine deposits, while interesting ecologically, are negligible from the point of view of this particular investigation. There are three broad classes of land: (a) " old field," areas from which the forest has been completely removed; (b) areas which have been severely disturbed by fire, cutting, grazing or otherwise, but not completely cleared of tree growth; and (c) areas which have been only slightly disturbed. The rather complex forest growth of Southern New England has been divided into three main associations, each a stage in succession. There is first the cedar-gray birch association, which comes in. on abandoned fields, and is succeeded by the hardwood association, composed of many broadleaf species, principally oaks, and gradually develops into the climatic climax hemlock-hardwood association. It would have been easy to recognize more associations and go into greater detail, but the result would have been much less useful. The simplicity, and consequent clarity of treatment, is one of the strong features of the bulletin. Some conception of the number of species involved may be gained from the 20 tables which have been wisely concentrated at the end instead of scattered through the bulletin. Those who object to anthropomorphism in scientific papers will probably shudder at the sentence on page 32: " The specialized species of the climax forest usually find the change of conditions which follows severe disturbances much to their dislike."' There are a few typographical errors, such as the caption of Fig. 20 (facing p. 34) in which "Plate XV " (there are no plates) should obviously be Fig. i8, and "Fig. 25 " on page 36, which should be Fig. 22. These minor matters stand out in a paper of such excellence. The photographs are unusually clear and really illustrate the descriptions in text. BARRINGTON- MOORE. WASHINGTON, D.
