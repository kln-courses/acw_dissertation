BERG, JR 1)2)3) (Department of Zoology, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.A.) (With 15 Figures) (Rec. 5-IX-I973) INTRODUCTION In spite of considerable interest in the natural history of gastropods, no comparative ethological studies have been reported. I have described the behavior of io species of Indo-Pacific strombid gastropods (Gastropoda : Strombidae) and have compared the behavior patterns of species within the superiamily Strombacea in order to gain insights into how the behavior originated and changed during speciation. The marine mesogastropod family Strombidae is composed of five genera (Strombus, Lambis, Tibia, Terebellum, Rimella) and 75 species (ABBOTT, I960). Strombids are circumtropical in distribution, but occur principally within the 20°C restrictive isotherm. They usually inhabit shallow waters, in areas with hermatypic coral. The adult snails are characterized by a shell with a thickened outer lip and a u-shaped "stromboid" notch near the anterior end of the lip. In some species (e.g. Lambis and Tibia) the lip is flared, with numerous spines on its edge. Other characteristics of the family include colorful eyes, which protrude from under the shell, the foot with a differ- entiated propodium, the jerky leaping mode of locomotion, and the use of the operculum in righting. Strombid snails have long been a favorite of scientists and shell collectors I) This research is based upon a dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ph.D. degree at the University of Hawaii, I97I. The work was supported by an N.D.E.A. IV Fellowship and by grants from the Atomic Energy Commission for research at Eniwetok Atoll. I would like to thank my doctoral com- mittee for their constructive suggestions, especially Prof. Ernst S. REESE and Dr George S. LoSEY. Dr Howard TOPOFF kindly read the manuscript and Dr Peter MOLLER translated the summary. 2) Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology Contribution # 456. 3) Present address: Department of Animal Behavior, American Museum of Natural History and Department of Biology, City College of the City University of New York, New York, N.Y.

Descriptions of their general morphology, and especially their striking eyes, date from the earliest expedition reports (QuOY &amp; GAIMARD, I832; FISCHER, I86I; TRYON, I880; BOUVIER, I887; HALLER, I893; WOODWARD, I894; BERGH, I895; RISBEC, I927; PRINCE, 1955; LITTLE, I965). Their taxonomy and general biology are reviewed by CLENCH &amp; ABBOTT (I941), DODGE (I956), RANDALL (1964), and JUNG &amp; ABBOTT (I967). ABBOTT (I960, I96I) deals extensively with Indo-Pacific species. The unique and distinctive behavior of strombid gastropods intrigued naturalists for well over a century (QuoY &amp; GAIMARD, 1834; ADAMS, I848), and anecdotal observations on strombid behavior continue to be reported (ADAMS, I966, I967; EISAWY &amp; SORIAL, I968). Locomotion, the behavior pattern which occurs most frequently, has received the most attention. It is the least difficult to release and occurs even in the most artificial situations. Locomotion is variously described in Strombus and Lambis as "s'elance par bonds" (QuoY &amp; GAIMARD, 1832, p. 36), "leaps" (ADAMS, I848, p. 493), "Hupfen oder Springen" (BERGH, I895, p. 342), and sliding (COLTON, I905, p. 87). All authors readily distinguish the jerky, discontinuous movement of strombids from the continuous and smooth common gastropod creeping. Two similar yet distinctive behavior patterns are described for the leap. In the first, the shell is thrown forward by a backward thrust of the foot and operculum (QuoY &amp; GAIMARD, 1832; ADAMS, 1I848; ADAMS &amp; ADAMS, 1858; YONGE, I932; RANDALL, I964; KOHN, I965; KOHN &amp; WATERS, I966). In the second pattern, the shell moves by a forward extension of the foot and a sharp muscular contraction which pulls the shell forward (COLTON, I905; PARKER, I922; PRINCE, 1955; MORTON, I960, I964). Both patterns are reported for the same species and the differences may be related to the nature of the substratum on which the snails were moving. Reports of locomotion out of water must be reviewed carefully, because the snail may be reacting to an abnormal situation with an escape response which is not necessarily the same as accelerated normal locomotion. Reports on the locomotion of sand dwelling species of Tibia and Terebellum (ADAMS, I848; ADAMS &amp; ADAMS, I858) may represent this possibility. The escape response of species of Strombus and Lambis to molluscivorous gastropods is reported for observations in pans and aquaria (ROBERTSON, 196I; KOHN, I965; KOHN &amp; WATERS, I966; GONOR, I966), and is described as accel- erated, but normal, locomotion. All of the species I observed show a distinct escape response pattern which will be compared with normal locomotion in those species. Whenever a shell is turned over, so that the aperture is up, the snail may</page><page sequence="3">276 CARL J. BERG, JR withdraw into the shell initially, but eventually attempts to turn the shell over, i.e., "right" itself. Strombids also differ from other gastropods in the way they "right." Most snails extend their foot over their shell, gain a purchase with the sole of their foot, and slowly pull themselves over; strom- bids gain a purchase by inserting their sharp operculum under the shell, and quickly jerk the shell over. This behavior is reported for six species of Strombus (PARKER, I922; QU.OY &amp; GAIMARD, I834; FISCHER, I962; BARDON, I962; RANDALL, I964), for L. lambis (YONGE, I932), and is probably responsible for the quick righting and the rolling described for Tibia sp. (ADAMS, I848) and for Terebellum sp. (ADAMS, I848; ADAMS &amp; ADAMS, I858; ABBOTT, I962; JUNG &amp; ABBOTT, I967). The movements of the mouth and extensible proboscis during feeding are reported for six species of Strombus (COLTON, I905; ROBERTSON, I96I; RANDALL, I964; ADAMS, I967; LITTLE, I965) and for L. lambis (YONGE, I932). Strombids feed on fine macroscopic algae and on the algae and detritus on sand grains. During feeding, sand may be picked up in the proboscis and swallowed, or macroscopic algae may be nibbled off the substratum. ROBERT- SON (I96I) reviews the literature and concludes that the presence of the crystalline style signifies an herbivorous or detrital diet for all of the strombids. The behavior of ten species of Strombus and Lambis is described herein. Each of the descriptive categories of behavior; locomotion, feeding, righting, and escape, are composed of one or more modal action patterns, as defined by the diagnostic properties given by BARLOW (1968). Throughout this paper, modal action patterns, hereafter referred to as MAP's, are designated by cap- italization. For example, righting behavior may be composed of the MAP Kick, which in turn is made up of the behavioral acts of extension, placement, and kicking at the substratum. The behavioral act of throwing the shell for- ward is called leaping, and constitutes a part of both the MAP Run and Leap. The term forward is used to designate movement away from (in front of) the anterior end of the snail. Backward movement is in the direction of, and away from, the posterior end of the snail. The animal is upside down when the ventral portion of the body and the shell aperture are directed away from the substratum. Detailed descriptions are given of the behavior of S. maculatus and L. scorpius. The MAP's of the other species observed are compared and described with respect to these two representative species. A comparison is also made with behavior patterns described in the literature for animals of other species in the superfamily Strombacea. The convergence and divergence of behavior patterns are discussed with respect to the ecology of the different species and the influence of different shell morphologies.</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 277 METHODS Quantitative data were obtained for ten species of strombids: Strombus maculatus Sowerby, 1842, S. mutabilis Swainson, 182I, S. gibberulus Linne, 1758, S. dentatus Linne, 1758, S. luhuanus Linne, 1758, S. lentiginosus Linne, I758, Lambis lambis (Linne, 1758), L. scorpius (Linne, I758), L. chiragra (Linne, 1758), and L. truncata (Humphrey, I786) from Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands; S. maculatus and S. dentatus from Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands; and S. gibberulus from Fanning Atoll in the Line Islands (Figure i, Table i).

Notes were made at the time of observation or collection of (i) the general physical conditions of the environment, and (2) the associated biota, including evidence of predation or mortality, and relative abundance of strombids. Field observations were made during the day and night throughout the year on Oahu, during the summer and winter at Eniwetok, and in January on Fanning Atoll. Predaceous gastropods of the genera Conus and Cymatium were collected and maintained in separate aquaria through- out the study period. Locomotion was observed and measured in the animals' natural habitats by marking the location of the snail with a nail stuck into the sand, counting the number of leaps for a set period of time, and measuring the distance covered. When the observation period ended, the route taken by the snail was marked at short intervals with nails to facilitate measurement of the often curved path. In this way, the animal was not</page><page sequence="5">CARL J. BERG, JR disturbed by the placing of nails during the performance of the behavior. Most ob- servations were made under water while sitting or kneeling on the bottom, approximately three meters behind the snail. Scuba was used where necessary. A stopwatch was used to measure the total trial period and the actual time the snail was moving. The same procedure was used in the laboratory. Locomotion was measured in sea water tables or in an arena (i m X I m X 0.2 m) during early evening, when the strombids and cones were active. The arena rested on a partially inflated truc'k tire inner tube to eliminate ground vibrations. The observations were made from a distance of one meter with indirect illumination of less than one foot-candle. Snails were placed on the sand bottom of the arena I5 minutes before the observation period began. Some snails were also tested on plastic or epoxy resin-covered bottoms, or on large flat rocks on which they had been collected. All tests were done at ambient water temperatures, which ranged in Hawaii from 24-25° C, and at Eniwetok from 27-29,° C. 30. ftfrI10_ Fig. i. Silhouettes of species of Strombus and Lambis. Silhouetttes represent relative shapes and mean adult sizes, of the species of Strombus and Lambis discussed in this paper. Studies of the responses to other species of gastropods (particularly to the mollusc- ivorous cones Conus marmoreus and C. pennaceus) were made in the same manner as for locomotion. The predator was placed "head to head" approximately one centimeter in front of the strombid, and the subsequent behavior recorded. Various combinations of snails, distances, and positions were tested. Most of these tests were performed on the strombids soon after measuring their locomotion, and only data from the first escape response were used in the analysis.. Tests were conducted both in the field and in the laboratory, and in both standing and slowly rimning water. The righting response was also observed both in the laboratory and the field. The snails were picked up, turned ventral side up, and allowed to fall a few centimeters through the ,water to the substratum. The time and method used for righting were then recorded. The shell was turned over again and placed on the sand in a new position. Righting was again observed and recorded. Snails were suspended or held in different positions and their behavior recorded. Quantitative data used in making comparisons among species were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis "H" test (TATE &amp; CLELLAND, 1957) unless otherwise specified. Feeding and burrowing also were observed both in the laboratory and in the field. Some snails were hand fed algae in order to observe their method of feeding. Observations of the actual body movements involved in all of the behavior patterns were made in small aquaria, finger bowls, and in a specially built plexiglas observation 278</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS tank. A mirror was placed under the tank at an angle 45° to the bottom so that observations could be made of the side and bottom of the snail simultaneously, and the movements of the soft body of the animal could thereby be studied under the shell. Quantification of the behavior was partially based on analysis of I6 mm and 35 mm films and video magnetic tapes. Records of the movements of a number of animals were automatically recorded using a hydrophone (CM2 model 706 connected to a sound activated switch and recorded on an Esterline Angus (model AW) operation recorder. The sound of the shell hitting the plastic bottom of the test chamber caused a mark to be recorded on a paper chart. These tests were run for 26 continuous hours with L. scorpius and for 101 hours with S. maculatus in the presence of the predator C. marmoreus. Shorter trials with a predator were run using S. tuhuanus and S. maculatus. OBSERVATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS Locomotion. All of the species observed moved forward in the characteristic fashion of short Leaps. The body movements of all species were similar to those reported and pictured for Chenopis (Aporrhais) pes-pelicani by WEBER (I924a). The MAP Leap can be described as a throwing forward of the shell and sub- sequent sliding forward of the foot (Figure 2). 0.00 - r. .00 4 * ·0.7 ;i j Bhl L 1.00 -e. Fig. 2.

The anterior part of the shell is lifted and pushed forward by the elongation of the footstalk, that portion of the body connecting the visceral mass to the foot. As the whole shell falls and slides forward, the sole of the foot may move backward. This backward motion is reduced when the propodium curls under and the entire sole, except that portion of the metapodium posterior to the operculum, is pressed onto the substratum. The operculum is held perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the foot and above the substratum. The distal tip of the operculum may dip toward the substratum when the shell moves. The eyes, eyestalks, and proboscis are pulled back into the shell when it falls forward. The shell comes to rest with only the widest portion of the body whorl lying on the substratum. The animal then resumes normal feeding behavior: the proboscis and eyes are extended with the eyes protruding from under the shell and the proboscis feeding on material located under the shell canopy. The propodium glides forward over the surface of the substratum, but pedal waves are not apparent. The rest of the foot is held above the substratum until the anterior edge of the propodium is approximately even with the stromboid notch, thus positioning the footstalk perpendicular to the substratum. The foot is then pressed to the sub- stratum as the footstalk elongates and lifts the shell forward. Using this method of locomotion, the snails moved at a mean of I.I cm/min (Table 2) by making 1.9 leaps/ min (Table 3) at a distance of 0.9 cm/leap (Table 4) during the test situation.

A slightly different method of locomotion is used when the animals crawl up and down the sides of aquaria. The whole foot continually adheres to the aquarium wall, perhaps by mucus or muscular contraction, and as the foot glides over the substratum the shell is lifted and thrown forward at regular intervals. Mucous strands may be produced when the snail crawls across sand in the test situation, but mucus is not usually found behind snails on the algal turf or sand in their natural environment. When moving over sand the snail may simply lift and place the foot in the new forward position. rather than gliding over the sand. Strombus maculatus is occasionally found partially buried in sand. This is accomplished by the combination of lateral rocking motions and forward locomotion. Strombus mutabilis. The method of locomotion is S. mutabilis is virtually the same as that in S. maculatus. The rate of locomotion was similar (Table 2) but was produced by a significantly (p &lt;.05, "U" test) greater number of leaps per minute (Table 3), and shorter distances (p &lt;.oi, "U" test) covered per leap (Table 4). On sand, the flat side of the operculum is pressed down onto the surface with each leap, but the edge of the operculum is not thrust into the sand. The substratum on which S. mutabilis occurs at Eniwetok consists of rocks and pebbles with silt between them. Strombus gibberulus. The method of locomotion of S. gibberulus is distinctly different from that of both S. mutabilis and S. maculatus. When the shell is thrown forward, the middle section of the sole of the foot (mesopodium) is not pressed onto the substratum and the whole foot moves slightly backward. As the foot moves backward, the distal tip of the operculum dips onto the substratum and swings backward from a position perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the sole and in front of the body whorl, to a new angle approximately 45° to the axis and posterior to the shell. Because the operculum passes under the shell, which is resting on the sand, it is forced into the sand and produces a mound and furrow. The movement of the operculum under the shell and the sliding of the shell on the sand wear off the periostracum and keep the shell clean. After the shell has fallen the foot is moved forward so that the footstalk is again perpendicular to the substratum or extended slightly. The operculum is lifted and moved anterior to its normal position perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the sole. The mean values for the rate of locomotion, number of leaps per minute, and the distance covered with each leap are nearly identical to those for S. mutabilis (Tables 2, 3, 4), but since S. gibberulus is larger (Table i), the per cent of shell length covered with each leap is less (Table 5). 28I</page><page sequence="9">282 CARL J.

Only one adult and one juvenile were observed. Both remained buried in the sand and quickly reburied when they were put on the surface for observation. On a hard substratum their locomotory behavior patterns were the same as those of S. maculatus. Strombus luhuanus. The locomotion of S. luhuanus is most similar to that of S. maculatus, but again there are slightly differences (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). When the shell is lifted and thrown forward, the operculum is kept perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the foot, but it is tilted slightly so that its posterior serrated edge is pushed down into the sand. The metapodium is lifted after each leap and the operculum is brought forward to the shell whorl lying in the sand. The metapodium is kept off the substratum until the shell is moved again.. To test for the role of the operculum in locomotion, the operculum was cut off at its attachment to the foot in four specimens (N = 4) and half way along its length in two (N = 2). Locomotion was slightly impaired because the foot slid back farther than usual, providing less purchase, thus making each leap shorter. The most posterior portion of the foot, behind the operculum, made the characteristic dipping motions even though the operculum was missing, but that portion of the foot did not touch the substratum. In S. luhuanus, the mesopodium is compressed laterally and is usually kept off the substratum throughout locomotion, rather than pressed onto the substratum as in S. maculatus. Strombus lentiginosus. This species uses a combination of movements described for other species. Moving basically like S. maculatus, its moves its operculum in the same way as does S. gibberulus but it also constricts and raises its mesopodium as does S. luhuanus. It covers a great distance per leap, with respect to the other species of Strombus observed (I.8 cm/leap = 27% of shell length/leap, Tables 4, 5), even though it is the largest species (Table i).</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 283 Lambis scorpius. The species of Lambis have relative heavier and larger shells than the species of Strom- bus observed. The spines on the shells curve upward so that the shell rests on the widest portion of the body whorl and the thickened edge of the lip. When lifted by the anterior spine, the shell rocks back on the posterior spines. Repeated lifting and dropping of several empty L. lambis shells caused the shells to move forward slightly.: The snails move forward (Figure 3) in the same general fashion as the species of Strombus (Figure 2), and within the genus Lambis I observed no differences in the body movements among the species. Quantitative differences in locomotion were measured for the four species (Tables 2, 3, 4), but all of the species moved approximately the same per cent of their shell length with each leap (Table 5). 1..0 Fig. 3. Locomotion of Lambis scorpius. Stippled area represents the portion of the animal's body in the shell aperture. Triangles indicate posterior tip of foot at starting position for Leap. Arrow shows direction of movement. In order to move forward, the shell is raised and slid forward by the elongation of the footstalk (Figure 3). As the shell falls forward, the foot moves posteriorly. The anterior edge of the propodium curls under and the rest of the propodium presses onto the sub- stratum. The mesopodium constricts laterally and is kept raised off the substratum. The metapodium presses onto the substratum and the distal end of the large operculum thrusts into the substratum and moves posteriorly as described for S. gibberulus. This produces a track of regularly spaced deep furrows in the sand. The eyes and proboscis are pulled under the shell. The foot then lifts off the substratum and moves anteriorly. The anterior edge of the prodium sometimes touches or glides along the surface of the substratum. The propodium sets down first, then the metapodium. The operculum moves anteriorly up to the body whorl and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the foot. It remains here, off the substratum, until the shell moves again.</page><page sequence="11">284 CARL J. BERG, JR Feeding. Characteristically, bouts of locomotion occur with feeding behavior. To- gether the two behaviors comprise grazing behavior. All of the species observed use the same general behavior patterns while feeding. The snails feed upon fine strands of macroscopic algae and the microscopic algae and detritus on sand grains. The proboscis usually remains under the shell of the species of Lambis but may extend out from under the shell as it does for Strombus. The eyestalks are extended with the eyes pointing upward, but the small cephalic tentacles on the eyestalks may move passively over the surface of the substratum. The extended proboscis moves back and forth in an irregular pattern, with the mouth directed toward the substratum and the radula rasping. Filamentous algae are eaten starting from the end of the strand, or they may be folded and eaten from the fold. The mouth moves over the algal strand until the end is found, or until the strand is folded. The radula picks up sand and passes it directly to the gut. Occasionally an animal was observed rasping sand into its proboscis, lifting the whole proboscis and turning it such that the mouth is highest and is directed upward, moving the sand around inside the end of the proboscis in a gargling fashion, then lowering the mouth and letting the sand fall out. This method may be an effective way of removing food from sand grains without having to ingest the sand. Snails also graze on the algae and detritus on rocks, other snails, and on themselves. Lambis truncata were found on a barren sand flat with numerous S. mutabilis and S. nmaculatus on top of their shells and feeding on the algae which grows there. On this same sand flat, L. truncata aggregate and feed off each other's shells and around the few rocks on the flat. Snails feed off their own shells by extending the proboscis through the stromboid notch and onto the shell. They also feed on the detritus-laden mucus on their own foot. The small tentacles on the eyestalks may be used for the chemical location of food. The tentacles touch the substratum anterior to the shell while the animal is feeding. Extension of the proboscis and feeding can be released from animals that have been in captivity for a few months by placing algae on the tentacles. No feeding attempts occur if algae are not present. Righting. If one turns a strombid upside down, its first response is to Withdraw into its shell, thereby covering the shell aperture with its operculum (Figure 4A). It will then slowly uncover the aperture by unfolding the foot and moving the metapodium posteriorly, exposing the ventral surface of the foot.</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 285 The operculum is held perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shell aperture. The eyes protrude from the aperture and point upward but show little movement. The tentacles on the eyestalks may move slightly. The snail remains in this "ready" position (Figure 4B) before making its first move- ment over the shell with the metapodium. Depending upon how the shell is lying on the substratum, the snail extends the metapodium and footstalk over either the shell's outer lip or the parietal lip of.the columella and then places the operculum under the edge of the shell (Figure 4D). All of the species of Strombus observed Kick very quickly at the substratum with their oper- culum. If a purchase is obtained, the shell is turned dorsal side up, on top of the extended foot (Figure 4E, 4F). The species of Lambis place the operculum firmly under the shell and Pull the shell over by a contraction of the footstalk. The propodium is usually extended back over the shell toward the aperture, but it is sometimes placed flush on the substratum and may aid the operculum by providing better leverage when pulling the shell over (Figure 4A-F). The terms Withdrawal, and either Kick, Pull, or Propo- dium Pull, designate the MAP's used in righting. A B C D E F 0 30 95.4 97 97.7 98 S0omds Fig. 4. Diagram of Strombus maculatus righting over parietal lip of columella. Data from motion picture analysis. See Table 5. Arrows indicate direction of motion. The snails often make slight movements with the metapodium in the direction of the area of the shell over which they are about to extend (Figure 4C). These are labelled "intention movements" (after LORENZ, I937, translated in I970), because the snail extends over that area soon after making these slight incomplete movements. The movements may just be a quick, short (i cm) jerk, or a slower partial extension over the shell. The foot usually moves back to its ready position between intention movements, although it may remain partially extended. Intention movements are well known in other animal groups (HINDE, 1970) but have not heretofore been reported for molluscs. After each unsuccessful attempt at righting, the foot withdraws to its ready position. With a greater number of attempts, the foot may not withdraw</page><page sequence="13">286 CARL J. BERG, JR completely but remain slightly extended. The snail then makes additional intention movements or simply more attempts at righting. The operculum is placed in different areas around the edge of the shell if the first attempts are unsuccessful. The initial attempts are usually made to that side of the shell lying closest to the substratum and further attempts are made to the opposite side or through the most posterior area of the aper- ture. The movements used in righting differ slightly among the species, as do the mean number of attempts required to right, the time taken, the occur- rence of intention movements, and the areas of placement of the operculum in repeated attempts (Table 6). These will now be described for each species.

Strombus maculatus. Snails were dropped through the water to simulate the positioning of naturally overturned shells. Strombus maculatus landed such that I7 of 3I initial righting attempts were made over the parietal lip and the remainder over the outer lip. When the shell was simply overturned, rather than dropped through water, nearly all attempts were made over the parietal lip. Quick Kick is the initial response, but the shell may be righted using the MAP Propodium Pull, by attaching only the propodium to the substratum and pulling the shell over. This is not the same as the Lambids' use of the propodium for leverage, as the operculum is not placed under the shell. The Kick response is quick, but not always successful. Propodium Pull is slower but very effective. It is often used when repeated kicks have been unsuccessful at righting the snail. Strombus maculatus took a mean of 2.4 attempts (n = 28) and 98 seconds (n = 26) to turn the shell over completely (Table 6). Intention movements were observed for only 5 of 31 tests (Table 6).</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 287 Strombus mutabilis. The gross righting movements appear to be the same as those of S. maculatus, but intention movements were not noticed. This may be due to the animal's small size. Righting was accomplished by Kicking over the parietal lip (9 of 12 tests), pulling over it (i), or pulling over the outer lip (2). The snails righted themselves in a mean of 45 seconds and required only 1.25 attempts (Table 6). Strombws mutabilis was the only species found overturned in the field, and then only iit two instances. Strombus gibberulus. This species lives buried in, or on the surface of sand. The shape of the shell and its stability indicate that it would be unlikely that these strombids would be overturned in any way, except by a potential predator. Unlike S. maculatus, it does not use its propodium to pull the shell over, but uses repeated Kicks. The action of these Kicks sometimes digs a hole in the sand under the shell, causing the strombid to roll or slide into the hole and thus right itself. On sand the animals utilized a mean of only 2.3 Kicks and 49 seconds to right themselves (Table 6), but on a plastic substratum a mean of 3.6 Kicks and 7I seconds was recorded (n = 25). Almost all (37 of 43) of the initial Kicks were made by extending over the parietal lip, the others over the outer lip (Table 6). Intention movements were recorded for only two of eight trials (Table 6). Strombus dentatus Two snails were tested and both righted themselves by Kicking over the parietal lip. When placed with the edge of the outer lip closest to the substratum, the juvenile snail Kicked over the outer lip, gave an intention movement, another Kick, and then pulled the shell over using Propodium Pull, as does S. maculatus. Strombus luhuanus. This species also lives in sandy areas and does not pull with the propodium when righting. Repeated Kicks result in digging a hole, as reported above for S. gibberulus. Most intitial Kicks were over the parietal lip and an average of only 2.9 Kicks was used to right (Table 6). A body movement similar to that resulting in the slow opercular placement displayed by species of Lambis is occasionally used, but the actual turning over of the shell occurs in a shorter time interval (Table 6). The animals tested required a mean of 307 seconds to right, with intention movements appearing in 8 of I8 trials (Table 6). Strombus lentiginosus. When dropped through the water, these animals land with the heavy outer lip lying on the substratum. The unequally sized nodules on the shoulder of the body whorl serve in positioning the shell. Many of the initial attempts at righting (6 of I5) were made by extending the footstalk through the stromboid notch and placing the operculum under the anterior end of the shell. As in S. luhuanus, a quick Kick with the operculum is used to right the shell. Although intention movements were recorded for only 5 of 12 trials, each of these five snails showed as many as three or four intention movements and thus prolonged the righting period (Table 6). When an animal was suspended horizontally in the water, the propodium was alternately extended over the parietal lip or through the stromboid notch, and eventually extended through the posterior portion of the aperture. Lambis scorpius. The spines on the shell of the species of Lambis determine how the shell lies on the substratum. In all trials with L. scorpiwms, the animal first extended the foot over the</page><page sequence="15">288 CARL J. BERG, JR parietal lip and placed the operculum under the anterior spine. Only after a mean of four attempts did the foot change position and extend through the stromboid notch. Data are given in Table 6. Spines were removed from a shell to test theivr effect upon the righting response. Without the spines the outer lip of the shell lay closer to the substratum. In the initial righting attempts the foot was extended over the parietal lip in the first and second trials, but through the stromboid notch in the third trial. The change in initial placement of the foot may indicate a definite change in the righting pattern of this animal. Lambis lambis. This species also consistently extended the foot over the parietal lip in righting (Table 6). Although the animal required only a mean of I.2 attempts to turn over, righting was slow because it waited in the ready position for a long time before at- tempting to right, and usually performed at least one intention movement (Table 6). Lambis chiragra. Both the shell and the movements of these snails differ from those previously described. The large shell has three spines on each side of the aperture, unlike the other species of Lambis, which have spines only on the outer lip (Figure i). The shell lies with the stromboid notch closest to the substratum and the foot reaches through the notch (13 of I4 attempts) and places the operculum under the shell, posterior to the middle spine (Figure 5). The shell was righted by slowly (x =- 2.9 seconds) turning over on the lip's spines. It is difficult for the animal to right because of the broad base made by the spines. If the foot does not reach under the shell far enough to get a strong purchase, 10 879 879.6 0 16 26 81 882 . 82.7 883 seconds 50 74 90 98 frms Fig. 5. Righting response of Lambis chiragra.

Repeated attempts are usually necessary (Table 6). Intention movements were shown in one half of the 14 trials, with a mean of 2.0 intention movements given before each attempt at righting. These snails often waited 30 to 60 minutes before trying to right themselves, and slightly withdrew the eyes and body many times during this period. The shells of juvenile Lambis have no spines or flaring lip; thus their shape is similar to that of the species of S'trombus. The single juvenile L. chiragra observed always righted itself by extending the foot over the parietal lip, never over the outc-r lip or through the stromboid notch as in the adults. Lambis truncata. Although the shells of L. truncata are massive, the animal required a mean of only 1.6 attempts to right itself (Table 6). All of the initial attempts were over the parietal lip and further attempts were to that area, or to the posterior portion of the aperture, not over the outer lip. In the field, some animals required more than 90 minutes to right, but in the laboratory as few as 2.5 minutes elapsed before righting. Intention movements were shown in four of seven trials (Table 6) with a mean of 2.5 movements given before the first attempt at righting. The propodium often pressed onto the substratum and the slow extension and Pulling over of the shell exposed the body for approximately 5 seconds (Table 6). Juveniles of L. truncata also lack spines, and right themselves by extending the foot over the parietal lip and pulling the shell over as in the adults. Escape. The presence of a molluscivorous Conus releases a distinctive escape response in all species of Strombus and Lambis that I observed. The escape response consists of three MAP's which usually occur in the following se- quence: Tentacle Wave, Backward Flip, and Run. The combination of these behavior patterns, with slight modification, occurs with every presen- tation of a cone and is characteristic for each species. The following is a general description of each MAP. Tentacle Wave. The eyestalks extend through the stromboid and columellar notches and the eyes point upward. The proboscis extends and the radula rasps. The small tentacles on the eyestalks, which are continually moving passively with water currents and body movements, begin to beat rapidly and constantly in all three dimensions in front of the eyestalks. Backward Flip. Backward Flip is preceded by Tentacle Wave and begins with the snail in its normal feeding position with the foot spread out under the shell. The operculum is moved forward and down onto the substratum very quickly and forcefully, causing the shell to rise off the substratum and move backward (see Figure 6). The posterior serrated edge of the operculum is thrust into the substratum and either holds fast or moves slightly forward,</page><page sequence="17">CARL J. BERG, JR e.g. in loose sand. As the shell moves backward with its longitudinal axis at an angle of approximately 20° to the substratum, the propodium maintains its position relative to the shell and the proboscis and eyestalks extend up and toward the apex of the shell. The foot folds upon itself as the propodium moves even with the metapodium, and the operculum is pulled up off the substratum. The whole body is now extended and trailing behind the shell. The shell lands with the aperture facing obliquely out over the substratum and the snail's body lying partially exposed. The operculum is then quickly swung back to its posterior position (see Figure 6). The MAP Backward Flip is comprised of a series of rapidly repeated flips backward, but the continuity of Backward Flip is broken when the oper- culum fails to get a purchase or when the shell lands upside down. If the operculum does not get a purchase, it is returned to its original position and the thrust movements are repeated until the shell moves backward. If the snail lands upside down, it rights itself quickly and then continues with Backward Flip or it may switch to either Tentacle Wave or Run. 1 2 3 4 6 i S4 30 Frmm4 Fig. 6. Backward Flip of Strombus maculatus during escape from a predaceous cone. Triangles indicate position of shell at the beginning of the behavior pattern. Numbers indicate frames of movie film taken at 24 frames per second. Total time for behavior pattern 1.25 seconds. The snail usually stops Backward Flip, switches to Tentacle Wave, and then starts Backward Flip again. After the initial pause, the operculum returns to its original position for either Run or more Backward Flip. The Backward Flip pattern is terminated when the shell aperture is placed in its normal position and the snail Runs. Run. The animal turns its propodium to either side and throws the shell in the same direction. The throwing forward of the shell is designated as a leap and is shared by the MAP's Run and Leap. Run is therefore similar to normal 290</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS locomotion except that the propodium does not glide slowly over the surface but the whole foot is lifted and rapidly pushed forward. The time interval between leaps is greatly reduced and the actual body movements are much faster. The proboscis elongates and probes over the substratum, but food is not ingested. The eyestalks extend through the notches, with the eyes directed upward. The tentacles beat and also move passively with each leap forward. This behavior pattern continues until normal locomotion and feeding begin, or until the snail, if it is a species of Strombus, burrows into the sand. The species specific escape behavior is now described for each species studied. Strombus maculatus The behavior patterns described above were observed for S. maculatus in the field and in the laboratory. The entire sequence is released, except when the cone is placed behind the strombid. In that situation, a few snails simply show Tentacle Wave and Run. Even though a snail is almost completely buried in sand or algal turf, Tentacle Wave is still released, and with only the eyestalks and tentacles protruding above the sub- stratum, the snail flips out backward.

The initial flip took the snail almost straight back, but by the fifth flip the track veered to either side (N = 5 to each side). It took only a mean of 4.2 seconds for these first five flips to move the animal an average of I2.6 cm (N = io). The rate of escape decreased from a projected i8o cm/min during the first five flips (N = io) to a mean of 94.i for the total Back- ward Flip escape response (Table 7). The time interval between flips increased appre- ciably, but the mean of 0.2 seconds spent off the substratum did not. Thus there was a decrease in the number of leaps per minute (71.4 vs 30.2, Table 8) with continued flipping, but there was a slight increase in the distance covered with each flip (2.5 vs 3.0 cm, Table 9). A small amount of mucus is given off by the propodium during Backward Flip, but no "trail" is left. Sand occasionally gets caught in the mucus and the propodium some- times adheres to the smooth bottom of a finger bowl or viewing chamber, holding the snail in place while the rest of the foot kicks rapidly. After Backward Flip the snail turns between go90° and i80° from the Backward Flip track and Runs. The rate of locomotion varies greatly as does the duration of the Run Some animals leap forward only once or twice before burrowing into the sand. Others Run for more than a meter before starting to feed on the surface. n-9 \ n:l14 % / \ X. : Flgs / \ / \ . \ conoe N/ , \ ! :2 -. ¥_.._ Fig. 7.

Arrows show direction of motion. The escape response is released by Conus pennaceus which is found on the reef bench with S. maculatus. Although C. pennaceus chases and eats S. maculatus in aquaria, there is no evidence that cones eat strombids on the reef bench. Gut and fecal pellet analyses of C. pennaceus by Dr. A. J. KOHN (pers. comm.) and myself have not revealed the remains of S. maculatus. To test for predation under nearly natural conditions, a running sea water table (area i m2) was arranged with sand and algae-covered rocks to simulate the habitat of the snails. One starved, but very active, C. pennaceus and two S. maculatus were left in the table for a week without predation occurring. However, the same cone captured and ate a S. wmaculatus in an arena with a plain sand bottom after termination of the above experiment. In another experiment, a large Conus marmoreus was placed in 34 liters of water with a S. maculatus. The escape response was released immediately. A secold S. macu- latus was added 48 hours later and also showed the escape response, but the first strombid 293</page><page sequence="21">CARL J. BERG, JR had stopped responding to the cone. When placed i cm in front of the cone, however, both strombids showed the escape response. Both snails were tested again 53 hours later and both responded only when placed in front of the cone. Strombus mutabilis. This species shows the same escape response behavior patterns as S. maculatus but the response is quantitatively different in all respects (Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, io). Although adults are nearly the same size, the escape response of S. mutabilis is slower than that of S. maculatus because it covers only one half of the distance with each leap. It com- pensates by making a greater number of leaps per minute. When a cone was placed at the anterior end of S. mutabilis the strombid flipped backward, but it Ran forward when the cone was placed at the posterior end (N = 3). Initially the backward flips threw the shell to the right (N = 5), but the path then went to the left, or forward past the cone. The snails tested in the field showed fewer flips (X = 1.3; N = 4) than those tested in the laboratory (X - 11.4; N = Io), probably because in the field the water currents carry away the cone scent and the strombid often gets turned upside down and stuck in the rough terrain. Strombus gibberulus. The escape response of S. gibberulus qualitatively and quantitatively resembles that of S. maculatus. There are no differences in the behavior patterns. The rate of escape locomotion and its components are similar yet slower than S. maculatus (Tables 7, 8, 9). The animal gave fewer (X = 10.9) flips backward (Table io) and in this respect is like S. mutabilis. When a cone was placed at the snailVs posterior end the strombid flipped backward, but the first flip was directed to its left side (I2 of I3 animals). The complete track went toward and then past the cone (N = 6) or directly away from it (N == 6). One animal simply moved two leaps forward, away from the cone, and buried itself with the normal rocking motions. All of the S. gibberulus flipped backward when a cone was placed at their anterior end. Most went to their left side (9 of 13 animals), and went either toward (N = 6) or away from the cone (N = 7). Tentacle Waving was fast during the initial escape response (5I beats/min) but slowed to 23 beats/min five minutes after Backward Flip ended and eventually slowed to approximately 6 beats/min during normal locomotion. Strombus dentatus The adult snail buried into the sand when placed in an aquarium with a C. pennaceus during the day, but the cone released all three MAP's in the juvenile snail. The juvenile flipped backward five times in three seconds, covering a distance of 27 cm and then dis- played Run. This gives a mean distance per leap of 1.7 times the shell length, which is greater than that recorded for any of the other snails (Table 5). The difference may reflect the greater general activity of this species, or the ability of juvenile snails to leap farther because of lighter and less ornamented shells. For the latter reason, all data in this report are for adult snails, unless otherwise specified. Strombus luhuanus. The escape response behavior patterns for this species are similar to those of S. ma- culatus except for differences previously mentioned under locomotion, and the tendency to flip backward at a greater angle to the substratum (approximately 45°). During Run the proboscis is pressed to the substratum but rasping does not occur. Tentacle Wave increased from 3 beats/min during normal locomotion (N = i) to 32 beats/min during Run (N = 3). The animal is much larger than S. maculatus and the thrust of its oper- 294</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 295 culum is stronger. The thrust can break the hold of a large C. marmoreus and causes the cone to withdraw into its shell. The escape response of S. luhuanus differs from those of the above species in that a mean of only 2.4 flips backward was made before Run (Table io). Thus Run com- prised the greatest portion of the escape response. The rate of escape is significantly slower than those of the other three species (P &lt;.ooI, Table 7). However, the escape response is much faster than normal locomotion (Table 2), with both a greater number of leaps per minute (Table 3) and a greater distance covered with each leap (Table 4). The Run portion of the escape response, without backward flips, has a rate of 23.8 cm/min, with 17.9 leaps/min and 1.35 cm/leap (N = 9). This rate is significantly faster than normal locomotion (P &lt;.oI, Table 2). It is slower than the rate of back- ward flips alone (44.I cm/min), but the difference lacks significance (P &gt;.05). How- ever, the distance covered with each backward flip (X = 3.1 cm, N = 5) is significantly (P &lt;.oI) greater than the distance covered with each leap forward (X == 1.4 cm, N - 9). This means that the animal gets farther away from a predator with one flip backward than with a forward leap, but that it is not necessarily faster to Flip for a long period than it is to Run. This may be due to the fact that during Flip the snail often lands upside down and has to right itself, thus making its rate of escape slower. These snails also seem to be able to sense the position of the cone. When a cone was placed at the animals' anterior ends, all snails flipped backward initially, but the track of two out of ten specimens curved forward past the cone. When the cone was placed at the animals' posterior end, eight leaped forward initially and six flipped to their left side, not backward, and then leaped forward. Strombus lentiginosus. The escape response of S. lentiginosus is like that of S. luhuanus as they both make only a few backward flips before Run (Table io). The foot is arched at the metapodium during Run and the proboscis is not fully extended as with the other species. Most animals flip backward once (Table io) and simultaneously turn to the right. If the snail is buried in the sand or if it does not get a purchase with its operculum, the first flip may be reduced to just a slight movement backward or a turn to the right. The snail then Runs forward past the cone (Figure 8) to either the right (N = 3) or left (N -= i), or Runs back away from the cone (N = i). However, the first flip can carry the snail 9 cm or i.I times the shell length away from the cone, a figure three times greater than the distance normally covered by escape leaps (Table 9). The flip backward is strong enough to make the shell somersault completely off the substratum. N:-lturn X:! turn f N3 3 N 5. lentiginosus L. scorpius L. truncata Fig. 8.

The similarity may be due to the fact that the escape response is essentially just Run and the behavior patterns are similar to those of normal locomotion but much more accelerated. The species o,f Lambis also use this pattern. Lambis scorps. The escape response of L. scorpius is representative of the other species of Lambis but is also similar to that of S. lentiginiosus (Table 7, 8, 9, io). Lambis scorpius and S. lentiginosus are of approximately equal size but are markedly different in shape. Tentacle Wave precedes a modified Backward Flip, which is followed by Run. In Back- ward Flip the snail raises the anterior end of the shell, turns to either side (N = 2 to each side) and then lets the shell fall back down onto the substratum (Figure 8).

Diagrammatic representation of the distances covered b,y L. scorpius during locomotion and escape. Each shell indicates one leap. Mean data from Tables 2, 4, 7, 8. is involved in turning. The first pattern is similar to that described for the turn at the beginning of Run. The foot bends at the mesopodium and the propodium is placed on the substratum. The footstalk greatly elongates, rocking the shell on the posterior spines and the shell is then thrown forward in the direction of the propodium. The second pattern is like the Backward Flip of S. lentiginosus. The operculum is pushed forward under the shell, but the heavier and larger shell is not lifted off the substratum. Rather, the anterior end of the shell is lifted, pushing the posterior spines into the substratum. The shell pivots on the posterior spines, turns to either side, and then falls to the substratum. The shell slides backward if the spines do not catch on the substratum. Both patterns were observed by viewing from underneath. During tests for escape response, the animal was viewed from above and rested on a sand substratum. This prevented seeing the body movements used in turning. With the normal turn pattern the operculum was sometimes visible if it was pushed from under the cover of the shell. However, the percentage of times that each method is used is not known. Run constitutes most of the escape response for the species of Lambis. The behavior pattern differs little from locomotion (Figure 2). Although Run is faster (Table 7), less distance is covered with each leap (Table 9). A greater number of leaps is made</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 297 each minute (Table 8 and Figure 9), due to both the shorter intervals between leaps (X = 2.5I sec, N = II) and the faster shell movements during leaps (X = o.46 sec, N = 14). The foot is lifted and swung forward rapidly. The propodium is placed ahead of the stromboid notch; thus it is more anterior than in normal locomotion (IFigure 2). The proboscis is not greatly extended and may lie in the siphonal notch in the anterior spine. With the extension and elongation of the footstalk, the shell rocks back on its spines and is then thrown forward. The snail quickly positions the foot and leaps again. In normal locomotion the snails leap around, not over, other snails and rubble. During escape they leap forward over all obstacles unless their anterior spines deflect their move- ment. They continue to Run for greater than 10 minutes (N = 4), even in the field (N = i), and are the most active snails in the genus Lambis. On their extremely rough terrain of coral rubble the animals must leap over large pieces of rubble and crevices between the pieces. They may cover only 75 cm during five minutes of Run (N = I) on the substratum. When all of the spines were removed, the shell of L. scorpius looked much like that of S. lentiginosus and the escape response was nearly identical. Backward flips off the substratum were performed. Lambis lambis. The escape response of L. lambis is similar to that of L. scorpius (Table 7) and the behavior patterns are identical. The mean values given in Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10 are affected by data for one old animal; thus the median value of 8I.o cm/min probably is more representative of the population. In a sample of five snails, three turned only once and the other two each turned three times (Table io). The snails turned equally to both sides, with three turning to the left and two the right, and one snail turning right, left, right, before leaping forward. Lambis chiragra. The behavior patterns of this species are identical to those of L. scorpius and the rate of escape is comparable (Table 7). However, the rate of escape is the result of fewer leaps per minute (Table 8) and a greater distance covered with each leap (Table 9). The animals turn once (Table io), and turn more often to the left (N = 4) than to the right (N = i). If the angle of the turn is not great enough, the snail may hit the cone with one of its large spines when leaping forward. It does not seem able to move backward, perhaps because of the broad base formed by the spines on both sides of the shell. Lambis truncata. This massive animal performs the same escape response behavior patterns found in other species of Lambis, but Run is much slower (Table 7). As with L. chiragra, the slower rate is due to fewer leaps per minute (Table 8) since the L. truncata covers a still greater distance with each leap (Table 9). Unlike the other species, L. truncata turned left in only five of eight trials (Figure 8); the other three animals simply leaped forward, hitting the predator with their heavy shell and causing it to withdraw into its shell. They continued to Run forward. A young L. truncata which had no spines or flaring lip (14.2 cm) flipped backward, up off the sand, in every test with C. marmoreus (N -= I2) but it landed either partially or completely upside down. After righting, it continued with Backward Flip and then switched to Run. Releasing Stimuli. Only molluscivorous cones are capable of consistently releasing the full escape response of strombids.

Piscivorous cones release Backward Flip in some strombids, but their radular teeth suggest a close affinity to molluscivorous cones (LIM, I969). The snails that released Backward Flip (BF), Run (R), or neither of these (NR) are listed in Table II. In these tests the predator was placed in front of the strombid. Water in which a molluscivorous predator had been sitting was also sufficient to release the entire escape response, indicating that only chemical stimuli are necessary. Chemical irritants such as 28% acetic acid released one or two flips backward in S. maculatus, S. gib- berulus, and S. luhuanus.

Tentacle Wave and Run were not shown. Other stimuli may also release parts of the escape response. Strombus maculatus, S. gibberulus, and S. luhuanus move their foot in the same pattern as in Backward Flip when the animal is taken out of the water and placed on a dry substratum, or when it is held suspended in air. A few individuals of S. gibberulus performed Backward Flip in the field when a bright light was shone on them at night. Tests in the laboratory did not replicate these observations. Strombus gibberulus also occasionally flipped backward when animals were uncovered and handled roughly. The sea star Asterope sp. is the only Hawaiian echinoderm that is perhaps molluscivorous (KOHN, I959). Strombus maculatus did not flip backward in the presence of Asterope sp. except when the sea star crawled over the snail and restrained its movements with the tube feet. The snail then broke the hold of the sea star with a series of Backward Flips and Kicks but did not continue with Backward Flip or Run. DISCUSSION Lo c o m o t i o n. All of the strombids use the same basic leaping pattern of locomotion, both on sand and on a hard surface. The major differences among the species lie in (i) whether or not the animals move their operculum when leaping, and (2) whether they glide or lift and then place their foot forward after a leap. The species of Strombus generally glide the foot forward while the species of Lambis lift and place it forward. Since the species of Strombus can crawl up the vertical sides of aquaria and sea water tables, they must be able to use the typical gastropod crawl. The species of Lambis do not crawl up the sides of containers, but this may be due to their heavier shell and not to the inability to crawl with the foot since they can move on horizontal smooth substrata. The species are listed in order of increasing shell length in all of the tables. In the population sampled, the shell lengths of the species are significantly different from the next closest species. One exception is the difference between L. scorpius and L. lambis (Table i). However, it should be apparent from Figure I that L. lambis (I5I.7 gm, N = IO) has a much stockier and heavier shell than L. scorpius (47.8 gm, N = 4). The lack of significant difference between the shell length of L. chiragra and L. truncata in the sample tested is probably due to the small sample size. Among the different species, the median rate of locomotion increases as a general hyperbolic function of the length of the animals' shell (least squares</page><page sequence="27">300 CARL J. BERG, JR fit, Figure io and Table 2). It was determined by means of the Kruskal- Wallis "H" test (TATE &amp; CLELLAND, I957) that the species of Lambis are significantly faster than the Strombus (P &lt;.005); that within the genus Strombus, S. lentiginosus is faster than the other species (P &lt;.oo5); and that within the genus Lambis, L. lambis and L. scorpius are faster than L. chiragra, which in turn is faster than L. truncata (P &lt;.005). In strombids, rate of locomotion is equal to the product of the number of leaps per unit time and the distance covered per leap, i.e. Rcm = (leap/min) (cm/leap). min 20 18 14 t. chlragra c 12 la mbl- t S. lentigino sus 8 S. mutebilis \ S. meculatus 2 '1 / S.Ig;bberulul 7 # ^ t ..................._ 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 shell length (cm) Fig. Io. Rate of locomotion zs size. Silhouettes indicate relative size and shape of each species. Both factors vary among species. In normal locomotion, as measured in the test situation, there are significant differences (P &gt;.oi) between the median number of leaps per minute made by each species (Table 3). The values for L. lam bis and L. scorpius are larger than those for the other species (P &lt;.05). The median values for leaps per minute differ for the two genera (P &lt;.o08 by Z conversion of x2). In general, there is an overlap in the range of values for all of the species. The values in Table 3 for the test situation are probably high estimates of the population values even though some animals did not move during the trial period. With the exception of S. gibberulus, the median distance covered with each leap also increases with greater shell length (Table 4, Figure I I ). There are significant differences among species (P &lt;.oo5), between the genera (P &lt;.oo5), and also among the following groups based on size classes: (i)</page><page sequence="28">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS four smallest Strombus spp., (2) 5. lentiginosus and L. scorpius, and (1.3) L. lambis, L. chiragra, and L. truncata. A calculation of the per cent of the shell length covered per leap (Table 5) produces a value which compensates for the unequal sizes of the animals. There is little variation among the values for the species and the median value of 24% is based on the median value for each species. There are no significant differences between genera.

Strombus lentiginosus, which is intermediate between the genera in shell length and planar area (Table I, Figure i) and looks much like a shell of L. scorpius with its spines removed, is also intermediate in its behavior (Figure II). The technique used in loco- motion may be a species characteristic and can be quantified by calculating slope (b) from Figures I and I2, using the median value for each species and the origin (o, o). There is no obvious relation between the technique used (b) and shell size, genus, or pattern of locomotion. The rate of locomotion appears to increase as a hyperbolic function of shell size (Figure io). Shell length (Table i) is used as an indicator of shell size in Figure io, but planar area of the shell, weight, length, tweight/length, 1f/weight/width, volume based on outside dimensions, and density based on weight and volume all show approximately the same relation to the rate of 3o0</page><page sequence="29">CARL J.

A comparison of the components of locomotion for the different species. Sil- houettes represent relative shape and size of each species. locomotion. Rate of locomotion is proportional to increasing shell length in species of Strombus (slope b = 1.33, P &lt;.oi, Table 2). However, within a single species, such as S. maculatus, rate of locomotion does not significantly increase with increasing length of the individual adult shells. For the species of Lambis, the rate of locomotion decreases (slope b - -.97, P &lt;.io, Table 2) with increasing median shell size. The largest lambids are the most lethar- gic, often sitting in one place for hours, whereas the largest species of Strombus and the smallest species of Lambis are the most active. There seems to be an optimum size for the snail, at which the foot is large enough to cover maximum distances with each leap and make many leaps per minute, but the shell is small although still large enough to provide protection and stability. Righting. Strombids are probably seldom overturned in nature. The low profile of the shell, its heavy weight, flaring lip, and spines prevent wave action and currents from readily turning it over. Predators such as crabs, fish, and octopuses, or fish which are grazing on their shell or on the substratum near them, may however, turn them over. All snails in the genus Strombus use the MAP Kick in righting, but the responses are quantitatively different (Table 6). There seems to be little relation between habitat and the differences in the righting response. Strom- 302</page><page sequence="30">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 303 bus mutabilis rights itself with fewer unsuccessful attempts than the other species. Strombus luhuanus uses more attempts because its kicks often do not turn the shell over but merely dig a hole in the loose sand. Although S. maculatus, which lives on a hard substratum, uses Propodium Pull fre- quently, it also uses a large number of attempts to right. All of the species of Lambis use the MAP of Pulling the shell over with the operculum wedged under the shell. It is seldom that they do not get a strong purchase with the operculum, so the initial attempt at righting is usually successful (Table 6). The shell may slide to the side if the oper- culum is not far enough under the shell, and more than one attempt is then needed. The species can be compared by analyzing the time required for righting. Four components can be recognized: (i) the number of attempts used and the time required for each one, (2) the number of intention movements and the time required for each, (3) the time spent in ready position, and (4) the time spent actually turning the shell. Within each genus, the time taken to right the shell increases with the number of attempts used (Table 6 B, C). Species in the genus Lambis (without data from L. chiragra) use fewer attempts (P &lt;.ooI) to right than those in Strombus. However, species of Lambis take longer to right than Strombus (P &lt;.oo5). In Lambis, the animals also show a greater per cent of trials with intention movements (P &lt;.05). The time spent in the ready position before attempting to right, between attempts, and between intention movements and attempts is the major constituent of the total time spent in righting. In the field, some species appear much more "cautious" than others. These stay in the ready position longer and show a greater per cent of trials with intention move- ments than the other species (Table 6 E). The most "cautious" animals are found in the larger species of Lambis, and they are the ones that expose the body area for the longest periods of time when actually turning the shell (Table 6F). They perform intention movements in 50% or more of the trials. The time during which the animals are exposed is a small fraction of the time spent in righting. The MAP Kick of the species of Strombus exposes the soft body parts, especially the footstalk and penis, for a much shorter time than Pull of the species of Lambis, which places the footstalk over the shell and pulls the shell over. Where there are great differences in shell sizes among the species (Table i), the larger snails take longer to turn over, especially in the genus Lambis in which the shells have a large lip and spines. All of the strombids show a tendency to right themselves by initially extending the foot over the parietal lip, with the exception of adult L. chiragra. This tendency is dictated by the way the shell rests on the substratum, as</page><page sequence="31">304 CARL J. BERG, JR demonstrated experimentally by repeatedly placing the shell in new positions and noting how it attempted to right. From these observations it appears that the animal has some means of detecting its position relative to the sub- stratum. There is a well developed statocyst in the foot (LIrrTTLE,. 967) which, perhaps with the aid of visual cues, allows the animal to orient itself. The species of Strombus initially attempt righting over the side that is closest to the substratum, which is usually the side of the parietal lip. The weight of the columella causes the shell to land with that side closest to the substratum. The spines on the shell of species of Lambis determine how the shell will lie. Therefore, these animals consistently right to one side (Table 6 D). Juvenile Lambis right, as do adult Strombus, to the side closest to the substratum. If all of the spines are removed from the adult shell, the animal slowly changes righting movements to the lip side, which is now closest to the substratum. Lambis chiragra is at a disadvantage in righting because both sides of the shell have spines (Figure 5). The stromboid notch provides the closest access to the substratum and therefore permits reaching the foot over the shell with the least extension and exposure of the body. Adult L. chiragra seldom reach over the parietal lip (Table 6 13B), but the spineless juveniles reach to the side closest to the substratum. This is the first report of intention movements (IM) among molluscs. If the intention movement of strombids is the result of incomplete inhibition of the righting response, then it is similar to the take-off leap of a bird before flying (HINDE, I970). The snail probably is not evaluating the substratum or shell position with the IM because the foot moves only a slight distance and does not touch the substratum. The repetition of the IM may be con- sidered as the result of a conflict between the tendencies to extend and withdraw the foot. The frequency of IM and their intensity, as measured by how far the animal extends, also increase with the time spent overturned. This change is similar to the increase in intensity of IM reported for birds (DAANJE, I951; LORENZ &amp; TINBERGEN, 1957). The IM probably is adaptive as a means of testing the environment for predators. The slight IM attracts nearby fish that might prey upon the snail as it extends over the shell. The eyes and tentacles, which are protruding slightly from the shell aperture when the animal is upside down (Figure 3), may sense the presence of the predators, and the animal remains in its shell until the tendency to extend is greater than that to stay withdrawn in the shell. The visual acuity of strombids is poorly known (FISCHER, I86I; (FISCHER, I96I) but the eyes possess the morphology necessary for vision (PRINCE, I955; GILLARY, I97I) and pulsed light causes electrical discharges</page><page sequence="32">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 305 along the afferent optic nerve (GILLARY, I97I), so perception of at least distant forms is likely. In the field, the snail's body withdraws into the shell when either fish or human divers pass over the animal. The larger snails are exposed for a longer time during righting, have the greatest per cent trials with IM, and generally show the greatest number of IM per trial. The long, sharp, serrated operculum and its quick movements have led to its being discussed as a weapon of defense against predatory fish, crabs, and octopuses (ADAMS &amp; ADAMS, 1858, PRINCE, 1955; ABBOTT, I960; FISCHER, I962; BARDON, I962). Its use as an organ of attack or utensil in eating has also been suggested by FISCHER (I962). The fact that the operculum hits the person who is holding the snail upside down should not be anthropomorphic- ally construed as a defensive action, but simply the incidental result of the righting response. Although it is reported above that Flip may break the hold of a cone or sea star, and that Kick may be released by handling S. gibberulus, I have never observed, or seen reported, that Kick breaks the hold of a predaceous fish, crab, or octopus. The kick might be effective against these predators, but their manipulation of the snail would probably keep it withdrawn in its shell until the shell was crushed or bored through and the animal eaten. Escape. Molluscivorous cones release identical MAP's in all the species of Strombus observed. The behavior patterns differ only quantitatively (Table io). The escape responses of the species of Lambis, however, are different. The shape and size of the shell modify the MAP Flip such that the animal turns instead of flipping backward. The snail may also turn without using Flip. The four smallest species of strombids, S. mutabilis, S. maculatus, S. gibbe- rulus, and S. d:entatus, differ from the rest since they perform many flips before Run. There is a significant difference (P &lt;.oo5) between the number of flips or turns given by the smaller species and the number given by the larger species (Table io). The difference is reflected in the rate of escape and its component parts (Tables 7, 8, 9 and Figure I3) since each flip is quicker and covers a greater distance than a leap, and the rates for the escape response are mean values for the whole response. With the smaller species, the escape response is comprised mainly of Flip. The following comparison of the data obtained for normal locomotion and escape (Figure 13) is subjective, in part, because the use of small numbers of paired data makes it im- possible to obtain significant probability levels for the differences between the two behavior patterns. This difficulty was caused by the scarcity of some of the species.</page><page sequence="33">306 CARL J. BERG, JR Escape locomotion is much faster than normal locomotion for all in- dividuals and there is no range overlap between the two rates within each species (Tables 2, 7). However, there is no significant difference between the rates of escape for each genus as a whole and there is no apparent relation between rate of escape and shell size (Table 6). These findings are quite different from those for normal locomotion. The species of Strombus, all of which use Flip, therefore show a greater per cent increase in the rate of locomotion during escape as compared with the species of Lanbis.

As has been shown for locomotion, field times tend to be slower than those from the laboratory. This may be the explanation for the slower times of S. luhuanus, since it makes a small number of leaps per minute. The slow rate of locomotion during escape may also be caused by the comparatively small distance covered with each leap and the fact that Flip is seldom used. For all individuals the number of leaps made each minute ls larger during</page><page sequence="34">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 307 escape than during normal locomotion, even though the ranges for locomotion and escape overlap for S. luhuanus and L. truncata (Tables 3 and 8). Again, these values may be smaller due to field conditions. The species of Strombus make a greater number of leaps per minute than the species of Lambis (P &lt;.oo5). Among all species studied, the number of leaps per minute increases with decreasing shell size (Figure 14, b == --.I, P &lt;.005). This trend is not apparent within a species, except when comparing the Eniwetok ®4 S. m,,,,lil; 40 ._.! * 20 t. - ,, IL 2 4 6 a 10 12 14 16 16 20 :2Z 24 2e 20 .30 Shell Length (cm) Fig. I4.

The smaller Eniwetok S. maculatus make a greater number of leaps per minute than both their larger Hawaiian conspecifics and S. mutabilis. Although the species of Strombus take more leaps during escape than the Lambis, the larger species of Lambis cover a greater distance with each leap (P &lt;.005, Table 9). The same comparison is true for normal locomotion. The three smallest species, S. mutabilis, S. maculatus, and S. gibberulus, all show an increase in both the distance covered with each leap (P &lt;.ooi on unpaired data for S. mutabilis and S. gibberulus, and paired data for S. maculatus) and the per cent of shell length covered with each leap (Table 5). The remaining species of Strombus and Lambis show a slight, but not significant,</page><page sequence="35">308 CARL J. BERG, JR increase in the distance or per cent shell length covered with each leap (Figure I3). The differences in the increases among the species correspond to the number of flips or turns taken during escape (Table io). The in- crease over locomotion in both values for the smaller species is due to the switch to the MAP Flip and the concomitant larger distance with each flip. The slight increases shown by S. luhuanus and S. lentiginosus are the result of performing a few flips (Table io) and covering a greater distance with each leap during Run. The species of Lambis only slightly increase the average distance per leap by turning but may increase the mean value for escape by a more powerful throwing of the shell during Run. The shell moves faster with each leap in Run and seems to be lifted higher. During locomotion the animals leap around rubble and other snails on the sand, but during escape they do not avoid obstacles, but crash into and attempt to crawl over them. This behavior and Tentacle Wave give the escaping animal a definite "panicked" appearance. The escape response is ineffective against fish, crabs, or octopuses which quickly pursue their prey using visual cues (GONxOR, I965). The remains of shells damaged by these predators are found in nature, and RANDALL (I964) discusses predation by such active predators on Caribbean species of Strombus. However, the majority of empty shells and those inhabited by hemit crabs are not damaged, which suggests either mortality not related to predation, or predation by an animal that does not destroy the shell, such as a molluscivorous gastropod. From gut and fecal analyses, cones are shown to prey upon strombids only in captivity and not in the natural habitat (KOHN, I959; KOHN &amp; WATERS, I966; GONOR, I966). The lack of evidence of natural predation on strombids by these co-occurring predators, the tests done in the animals' natural habitat, and the experiments described for S. maculatus are an indication of the adaptiveness of the escape response. Molluscivorous cones capture their prey by first paralyzing it with a toxin injected by a dart-like radular tooth from the modified proboscis and then covering the victim with the foot and proboscis while feeding. Potential prey must get out of range of the extensible proboscis very quickly to avoid being "shot" and paralyzed. Other molluscivorous snails must crawl over their prey and envelop it with the foot to immobilize it. Potential victims may success- fully outrun these predators. The first escape turn or flip of the strombid immediately separates the cone and its victim by an appreciable distance. The initial rate of escape is much faster than the rate for the total escape response and smaller animals, which do not cover as great a distance with each leap, show a greater number of leaps per minute than larger animals. Thus both the larger and smaller</page><page sequence="36">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 309 snails move away from a cone at approximately the same rate (Table 7). Once they are away from the cone, the strombids Run. During the pause in backward flips the strombids probably use chemical cues to test for the presence of the cone. If it is detected, more flips are released, but if not, Run is released. The irregular track taken by a strombid performing Flip is similar to protean behavior shown by other escaping prey (HUMPHRIES &amp; DRIVER, I970). Conus marmoreus were observed following the trail left on a soft sand substratum by a normally locomoting S. maculatus, but Flip does not leave a mucous trail which the cone can follow. Because the strombid's track veers to the side or goes forward past the cone, the animal avoids further detection by the cone, by removing itself from the currents carrying its scent down to the chemically orienting, positively rheotactic cone. The turn and Run of the species of Lanibis also remove the animal from the water currents passing over the cone. By crashing into the cone and causing it to withdraw, the lambid effectively removes itself from immediate danger, as with Flip. It is unlikely that cones feed upon large L. chiragra and L. truncata which occasionally exhibit this behavior, but the escape response is retained in the adults even though it is probably most adaptive for the juveniles. The strombids' escape response is equally effective against other mollu- scivorous gastropods, since Flip or Kick breaks the predator's hold (personal observation; GON.OR, I966) and also serves to remove the strombids from the water currents necessary for prey detection. However, molluscivorous gastropods of genera other than Conus often release only Tentacle Wave and Run. These MAP's are sufficient escape mechanisms. Thus the MAP's associated with strombid escape behavior appear to be beautifully adapted to quickly remove the animal from contact with a predator and to effectively eliminate a chemical trail which the predator may follow. Releasing Stimuli. Strombids respond to a variety of chemical, visual, and tactile stimuli with the MAP's of Withdrawal, Tentacle Wave, Run, and Backward Flip. Noxious stimuli release highly variable avoidance responses which usually include Withdrawal but not Backward Flip. The complete species typical escape response is released by specific chemical stimuli from only a few predators. Chemical stimuli alone are sufficient to release the entire escape response, as shown by adding water in which a predator had been immersed to the container with the strombids (this report and GONOR, I966), and by ablating</page><page sequence="37">310 CARL J. BERG, JR the eyes and then presenting a predator (FIELD, I970). The precise effective stimulus has not been identified but it is probably from the body of the living cone. In addition to difficulties in identifying the stimulus, the concentration and direction of the stimulus to which the snail is responding are extremely hard to assess because of mixing with surrounding water. Gastropods respond to a great diversity of chemical stimuli (KOHN, I96I; MCCAULEY, I969) but the sites of reception are questionable (HODGSON, 1955; KOHN, I96I). The extensive work on gastropod responses to predatory sea stars is reviewed by FEDER &amp; CHRISTENSEN (1966), FEDER (1967), CRUMP (I968), and MAUZEY, BIRKELAND &amp; DAYTON (I968). The chemicals extracted from frozen sea stars (FEDER &amp; LASKER, I964; FEDER &amp; ARVIDSON, I967; MACKIE, LASKER &amp; GRANT, I968; MACKIE &amp; TURNER, I970; MACKIE, I970) in attempts to identify the chemical which releases the gastropod escape response may have no relation to the stimuli to which the snail responds in its natural habitat, but may simply be a general irritant. The literature on gastropod responses to other gastropods is well reviewed by KOHN (196I), FRETTER &amp; GRAHAM (1962), GORE (1966), KOHN &amp; WATERS (I966), SNYDER (I967), and EDWARDS (I969). It is apparent from the literature that a large number of taxonomically and ecologically diverse species have developed the ability to detect and escape from molluscivorous predators. The snails may respond to non-predators which are phylogenetically closely related to known predators, indicating that the effective stimuli may be shared by related species. Strombids respond with greatest intensity, as measured by latency, speed, and duration of the escape response, to all molluscivorous cones, but some species of cones are more effective than others in releasing the response. The strombids' response to piscivorous cones may be due to the relation of the piscivorous cones to molluscivorous species, or to their occasional mol- luscan diet. The latter explanation may also account for the response to molluscivorous species in other genera, e.g. Cymnaticum nicobaricum. THORPE 1944, I956) points out that animals may take avoiding action to a wide range of stimuli, including moving objects, strange situations or stimuli, and stimuli of high intensity. The strombids' response to handling, flashing light, dry substrates, or moving shadows (ROBERTSON, I96I) agrees well with THORPE'S point of view. The effectiveness of a stimulus in releasing an escape response rests not only upon the stimulus itself, but also on the sum total of all internal and .external factors affecting the snail. Experiential factors may also be im- portant (THORPE, 1944, I956). There is great individual variation in sens- itivity and response to predators, as well as temporal variation within in-</page><page sequence="38">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 311I dividuals. Responding to increasingly smaller concentrations of cone factor or other stimuli may be an indication of a lowering of the threshold of sensitivity due to deprivation of the releasing stimulus. The strombids' response to mechanical stimuli and to non-molluscivorous gastropods may also be due to threshold lowering. The opposite relation between stimulation and thresholds is also true. With repeated stimulation by a predator, the prey may stop responding, as des- cribed for such gastropods as Diadora aspera and Acmaea spp. (BULL.OCK, 1953; MARGOLIN, I964a, I964b), and this may explain why the predator captures prey in laboratory tests but not in nature. Strombus maculatus kept in an aquarium with a Conus marmoreus do not continually Flip or Run away from the cone, but respond when the cone is placed less than a centimeter in front of them. Cessation of response is not due to muscular fatigue, sensory adaptation, or damage to sensory systems (MACKIE, 1970), since the strombids respond when placed closer to the cone, but cessation may be due to increased sensory thresholds or afferent throttling, using the terminology of SCHLEIDT (I954). It is extremely unlikely that afferent throttling occurs in nature because the escape response removes the strombid from the releasing stimuli. Behavior of other StrombidIs. References to the literature on the behavior of strombids (genera Strom- bus, Lambis, Tibia, Terebellum, Rimella) are given in the introduction. Although all species in the Strombidae show the discontinuous, jerking form of locomotion, different behavior patterns may be involved. Many of the reports on locomotion simply refer to the description by PARKER (I922), who observed locomotion in S. gigas by laying the animal on its side in an aquarium and noting its first "leap" forward. In fact, PARKER (1922) was describing righting. Because of the large shell, the actual body movements involved in strombid locomotion cannot be adequately observed, except from a ventral aspect. The relationship between the extension of the foot and the forward movement of the shell can best be understood by noting the angle made by the footstalk which connects the two. This was pointed out by WEBER (I924a) who compared leaping in Aporrhais pes-pelicani with PARKER'S (1922) reports for S. gigas. When the shell is thrown forward by an elongation of the footstalk, the proximal end of the footstalk is anterior to the distal end. As the foot moves forward, the axis of the footstalk becomes perpendicular to the substratum (Figure 3). If the foot extends forward and then pulls the shell up to it, the opposite relation would hold, that is, the distal end of the footstalk would be most anterior. On the basis of WEBER'S (I924a) discussion of the musculature and mechanisms involved in leaping 21</page><page sequence="39">312 CARL J. BERG, JR by A. pes-pelicani, the close taxonomic and behavioral relation between the aporrhaids and strombids, and my own observations, I believe that many of the reports of strombid locomotion describe the gross movements correctly, but the body movements and the mechanisms involved have been misinter- preted. Detailed cinematographic analyses of movements of the body parts, as viewed from a ventral aspect, probably will reveal the same or similar MAP's to be reponsible for the leaping described throughout the family Strombidae. Thus Leap may be a MAP characteristic of the family, not of just a species, with species differences based on the frequency and magnitude of Leaps on various substrata. This does not mean that the strombids are adapted for life on the surface of sand only (YONGE, 1932), because the MAP Leap is equally effective on rubble and the reef bench. The approximate values of 30 to 50% of shell length per leap reported for S. gigas (PARKER, 1922) and 25% for L. lambis and S. canarium (KOHN &amp; WATERS, I966) correspond with data presented in Table 5, as do the rates of escape (KOHN &amp; WATERS, I966). However, the rate of locomotion reported for S. canarium is faster than expected on the basis of shell size (Table 2, Figure 4). The discrepancy between KOHN &amp; WATERS' (I966) observed values and my predicted values may be due to their small number of observations made of one individual of each species, or a different test situation. As mentioned earlier, feeding is alternated with locomotion. Although feed- ing of species of Tibia, Terebellum, and Rimella has not been reported, all strombids probably have the same basic food habits and feeding behavior as suggested by morphological similarities and the presence of a crystalline style (ROBERTSON, I96I). The specialized pattern of rolling sand grains in the proboscis has been observed for S. gigas (RANDALL, I964) and S. dentatus (ADAMS, I967), but the most common pattern is grazing over the surface of the sand and on macroscopic algae. The descriptions of the feeding behavior of five species of Strombus from the tropical Western Atlantic (ROBERTSON, T96I) are identical with those for the Indo-Pacific species. The strombids share a common response when overturned. The first response is Withdrawal, followed by righting using the MAP of either Kick or Pull. Detailed descriptions of righting have not been given for any species of Terebellum or Rimella, and many of the descriptions for species of Strombus, Lmnbis, and Tibia simply note the force and rapidity with which the animals right. In this respect strombids are quite conspicuous and different from other gastropods. The MAP's Kick and Pull differ mainly in the area and speed of placement of the operculum, and the speed of turning the shell over. Whereas the speed of turning over may be a function of the</page><page sequence="40">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 313 weight of the shell and its resistance to being turned over, the speed and area of placement is characteristically different among the genera. The fact that juvenile L. chiragra, which have a shell shape similar to the species of Strombus, use Kick suggests that secondary modification of the Strombus righting response has taken place in the adults of the species of Lambis. Species-specific differences in righting are due to differences in repetition and duration of the behavior acts. These are often influenced by individual variation and environmental conditions. Observations on the righting of the very large species of Strombus living in the tropical Western Atlantic would clarify the role of shell size upon righting behavior. To the best of my knowledge, the MAP Flip has never been described in the literature for any gastropod. The escape responses of strombids described by ROBERTSON (I96I), KOHN (I965), KOHN &amp; WATERS (I966), and GONOR (I966) are comprised solely of Run, as indicated by GONOR'S (I966) analysis of the escape response as differing from locomotion only in frequency and strength of leaping. Run is released by molluscivorous gastropods in their tests, and perhaps the erratic kicking noted by GONOR (I966) is, in part, Flip. The brief comments of ADAMS (I848) on S. gibberulus leaping several inchess off the ground or of JUNG &amp; ABBOTT (I967) on Terebellum tere- bellum darting through the water may be the only notes describing Flip in the' literature. Closer analysis of the escape response to naturally occurring predators, and experiments with molluscivorous cones, should reveal Flip in other strombids. Although the escape response of most gastropods includes accelerated normal locomotory patterns similar to Run, no other gastropod escape response is identical to Flip. The twisting somersault of the nassarids (WEBER, I924a; HOFFMANN, I930; GORE, I966; FEDER, I967) are similar to Flip, but distinctly different patterns of foot movements are involved. The backward flip of the bivalves (FEDER &amp; CHRISTENSEN, I966), espec- ially species of Cardium (FEDER, I967), closely resembles the strombid Flip. The adaptive value of immediate separation of an animal from a possible predator is especially important for the otherwise stationary bivalves or slow moving gastropods. General characteristics within the Strombacea. The superfamily Strombacea consists of four families: Strombidae, Apor- rhaidae, Struthiolariidae, and Xenophoridae (THIELE, 193I; ABBOTT, I954; HYMAN, I967). The species in these families share many morphological and behavioral characteristics even though their shell structures differ greatly. MORTON (I958 and pers. comm.) suggests the removal of the Xenophoridae 2I*</page><page sequence="41">314 CARL J. BERG, JR from the Strombacea mainly on the basis of shell morphology, while placing little value on the common retention of primitive morphological characteristics and the sharing of advanced ones. The morphology of the xenophorids' foot, which resembles a laterally compressed foot of actively leaping strombids, the internal anatomy of xenophorids and other strombids (HALLER, I893; MORTON, I958), and the behavior of the xenophorids (ADAMS, I848; CROZIER, I919; MORTON, I958; SHANK, I969) all indicate a close affinity between the Xenophoridae and the other members of the Strombacea. In fact, ADAMS (1848, p. 558), who observed living specimens of Phorus (Xenophoridae), Terebellum, Strombus, and Rostellaria (= Tibia; all in Strombidae), comments on the intimate connection of the species "with the same habits and necessities, and living in the same peculiar manner." I believe that shell design should not be the deciding factor in not aligning the Xenophoridae with the Strombacea, but that all of the characteristics of the group should be considered, and in this instance, behavior and morphology override the apparently secondarily diverged shell. The leaping form of locomotion, as best described by WEBER (I924a), occurs not only in the Strombidae, but also in the Aporrhaidae (WEBER, i924a; YONGE, I937; MORTON, 1960, I964) and Xenophoridae (SHANK, 1969). Because leaping behavior is unique among the prosobranch gastropods and appears to be derived from the same MAP's, it can be used as a charac- teristic of the superfamily Strombacea. The qualifications mentioned in the discussion of its use as a familian characteristic are applicable here. Addi- tional, detailed observations are needed. Although all species in the Strombacea are detrital or herbivorous feeders and possess a crystalline style, there are distinct differences in feeding habits. All except the Struthiolariidae, which are deposit feeders (MORTON, 1950, I951), use morphologically and functionally similar proboscises and radulae in rasping. The morphology and behavior associated with feeding are des- cribed for the Xenophoridae (MORTON, I958, SHANK, I969), Struthiolariidae (MORTON, 1950, 1951), and Aporrhaidae (YONGE, I937; BARNES &amp; BAGE- NAL, 1952). Righting by snails within the Strombacea consists of obtaining a purchase on the substratum with either the operculum or the sole of the foot, partic- ularly the propodium, and sharply contracting the extended footstalk to heave the shell over. Both methods may be used by individuals of the same species, as described herein for S. maculatus, and for Aporrhais pes-pelicani by MORTON (I964). The MAP's Pull and Propodium Pull, using either attach- ment of the sole of the foot or the operculum, apparently are the only reported methods of righting in the aporrhaids (WEBER, I926; YONGE, I937; MOR-</page><page sequence="42">COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS 315 TON, I960, I964) and xenophorids (MORTON, 1958; SHANK, I969), but the struthiolarids appear to Kick over the parietal lip (MORTION, I951) as do the species of Strombus. Again, these behavior patterns are characteristic of the superfamiliy. The final behavior pattern shared by the species within the Strombacea is the escape response. Unfortunately, there are few reports of escape responses to molluscivorous cones or other naturally occurring predators. Aporrhaids respond to shredded tissues of bivalves by moving away, some- times backwards (YONGE, I937). This response is probably similar, if not identical, to the MAP's Flip and Run of species of Lambis which share the same general shell shape with the aporrhaids, but YONGE (I937) gives no description of the body movements. Xenophorids have not been studied in their natural habitat and there is no reference to their escape behavior except, perhaps, the leaping which MORTON (I949, I958) reports for animals dredged from the bottom and placed on the deck of a ship. The erratic movements he mentions may be Run or Flip. Although CRUMP (I968) states the escape response of Struthiolaria papu- losa gigas generally resembles that of the nassarids, he points out that it differs in detail. The most striking point is the initial opercular kick, pre- viously described and diagrammed by MORTON (I95I) as an opercular mode of progression. This behavior appears to be identical with Flip. The movements following Flip resemble those reported for nassarids and seem adapted for breaking the hold of predaceous sea stars. The MAP Flip may be shared by other species within the Strombacea but detailed descriptions are needed. The behavior patterns of the species within the Strombacea seem to be (lirectly associated with protection from predation. Locomotion in the dis- continuous manner may aid in avoiding detection by a predator. Feeding with the proboscis under the shell keeps it from being bitten off. Righting by means of the quick Pull or Kick exposes the body for as short a time as possible. Escape by using either Flip or by turning and Run removes the snail from its predator immediately. The retention of similar behavior pat- terns in such a geographically widespread group suggests that these behavior patterns may be a conservative indication of evolution within the super- family, especially because even the most primitive aporrhaid species and the most derived strombid species share the behavior patterns and differ little from the xenophorids which have a quite divergent shell. It is readily apparent that the Strombacea are a closely related group of gastropods on the basis of their morphology and behavior. Figure 15 sum- marizes the similarities in behavior.

The retention of the common strombid behavior patterns by juvenile species of Lambis, the reversion in behavior with modification of the shell of L. scorpius, and observations on the ontogeny of strombid behavior (BERG, I972) all support this theory. SUMMARY The behavior of ten species of strombid gastropods (Strombus and Lambis spp.) was studied in the Marshall, Hawaiian and Line Islands. Measurements were made in both the laboratory and the field of the MAP's comprising feeding, locomotion, righting of overturned shells, and escape from predators, which reflect significant ecological and morphological determinents of behavior in the Strombacea. All species feed by grazing with the proboscis under the protection of the shell. All Strombids use the MAP Leap during locomotion. The rate of locomotion varies as a hyperbolic function of length; increasing with greater size in the genus Strombus and decreasing in the genus Lambis. Larger animals travel a greater distance with each leap but make fewer leaps/minute. Species of Strombus right their overturned shells by a Kick at the substratum with the operculum, but species of Lambis use the MAP Pull and turn the animal over with the operculum wedged under the shell. Only one attempt is needed in the species of Lambis, but more are used by the faster moving species of Strombus. Intention movements are performed during righting. Species of both genera escape from molluscivorous cones using the MAP's Tentacle Wave, Flip and Run. In the species of Strombus, Flip causes a backward movement of the shell off the substratum, but in species of Lambis the shell restricts the movements and the animal merely turns to one side. Escape locomotion is much faster than normal locomotion, due to the greater distances travelled with each flip by the smaller species of Strombus and the greater number of leaps/minute made by all species. The flip escape response appears particularly adapted for escape from dart-shooting predators. A review of the literature on strombid behavior shows that the behavior of all species within the Strombacea is remarkably similar even though there is great disparity in shell shapes. Because of similarities in soft body parts and behavior, the Xenophoridae should be retained within the Strombacea. It is suggested that the species within the Strombacea evolved in parallel from a common aporrhaid-like stock and the behavior has diverged less than shell form and is therefore a more conservative character in the group's phylogeny than is shell shape. The behavior of a snail can be greatly modified by its shell. Differences in behavior between Strombus and Lambis are attributed to restrictions imposed by the shell and not differences in body movements. Behavior must be adapted to the shell shape and both, of course, reflect the animal's ecological setting. REFERENCES ABBOTT, D. P. (I962).

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Das Verhalten von zehn Gastropodenarten der Gattungen Strombus und Lambis wurde auf den Marshall-, Hawaii- und Line-Inseln mit Feld- und Laborbeobachtungen unter- sucht. Unser Augenmerk war dabei auf die folgenden Verhaltensweisen (Erbkoor- dinationen- ,,modal action patterns"), die wesentliche 6kologische und morphologische Verhaltensdeterminanten darstellen, gerichtet: Fressverhalten, Lokomotion, Aufrichten der Schale aus iiberrollter Position und Fluchtverhalten. Alle beobachteten Arten weiden mit Hilfe des Proboscis unter dem Schutz der Kalk- schale. Die Lokomotion der Strombiden (Fliigelschnecken) ist durch sprungartige Bewegungen charakterisiert. Ihre Geschwindigkeit (Spriinge pro Minute) kann in Abhangigkeit von der Lange des Tieres durch eine hyperbolische Funktion beschrieben werden. Bei Strom- busarten steigt die Geschwindigkeit mit zunehmender Korpergr6sse an, fuir Lambisarten nimmt sie ab. In beiden Gattungen legen gr6ssere Schnecken mit jedem Sprung eine weitere Strecke zuriick, springen jedoch weniger hiufig. Strombusarten richten sich durch mehrmaliges vom Substrat Abstossen des Schalen- deckels in die Normallage zuruiick. Lambisarten hingegen verkeilen ihren Schalendeckel unter der Schale und ziehen sich mit einem Ruck in die Normallage zuriick. Wihrend des Aufrichtens beobachtet man Intentionsbewegungen. Arten beider Gattungen fliehen vor muschelfressenden Kegelschnecken (Conus spp) mit Tentakelbewegungen, Spriingen und schnellen ruckartigen Bewegungen des K6rpers. Diese Bewegungen verursachen bei Strombusarten eine Riickwirtsbewegung des ganzen Tieres, wahrend dieselbe K6rperbewegung bei Lambisarten, bedingt durch die Schalen- form, nur eine Seitwirtswendung des Tieres verursacht. Die Geschwindigkeit der Flucht- reaktion ist h6her als die der normalen Lokomotion und wird durch die gr6ssere Sprung- weite bei kleineren Strombusarten und eine h6here Sprungrate aller Arten beider Gat- tungen bedingt. Diese Fluchtreaktion in Anwesenheit von Kegelschnecken scheint be- sonders gut angepasst zu sein. Bei Durchsicht der Gastropodenliteratur fallt eine bemerkenswerte Ahnlichkeit der Verhaltensweisen innerhalb der Familie der Strombidae ins Auge, obwohl gleichzeitig eine grosse Vielfalt der Schalenform vorliegt. Die Familie der Xenophoridae sollte daher innerhalb der Oberfamilie der Strombacea verbleiben, weil Ahnlichkeiten in der Morphologie der Weichteile und im Verhalten mit anderen Gattungen der Strombidea vorliegen. Es wird vorgeschlagen, dass sich die Arten innerhalb der Strombacea parallel aus einer den Aporrhaidae ihnlichen Gruppe entwickelt haben, und dass sich das Verhalten</page><page sequence="49">322 BERG, JR, COMPARATIVE ETHOLOGY OF STROMBID GASTROPODS weniger divergent entwickelt hat als die Schalenform, und damit ein konservativeres Merkmal der Stammnnesgeschichte dieser Gruppe darstellt als die Schalenmorphologie. Das Verhalten der Schnecke kann in hohem Masse durch die Schalenform modifiziert werden. Verhaltensunterschiede bei Strombus- und Lamnbisarten werden auf Eigenarten der Schalenform und nicht auf unterschiedliche K6rperbewegungen zuriickgefiihrt. Das Verhalten muss der Schalenform angepasst sein; selbstverstandlich spiegeln Verhalten und K6rperbau die 6kologischen Angepasstheit wider.</page></plain_text>
