<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shaykh Muhammad ibn cAbd al-Wahhàb and Shah Wall Allah: A Preliminary Comparison of Some Aspects of their Lifes and Careers* Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim Department of History International Islamic University Malaysia Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb (1703-1791) and Shâh Wall Allah (1703-1762) were, indeed, the two key Mujaddis in the entire eighteenth-century Muslim world. Many scholarly and amateurish works were produced in English, Arabic, Urdu and other languages on their substantial achievements, but I am not aware of any inde pendent comparative study of their careers and thought. This paper is, however, just a preliminary attempt to construct such a comparison and contrast through studying some aspects of their colourful lives and intellectual legacies. The discourse contests, in partic ular, the neologism "Indian Wahhâbism", which had been coined by some orientalists to designate the Indian Islamic reformist movement, because, to say the least, it implicitly, but without justification, condemned it as a carbon copy of Wahhâbism, and its van guard, Shah Wall Allâh, as a replica of his contemporary Muhammad ibn 'Abd al Wahhâb. The discourse suggests that the Shaykh and the Shah founded and spearheaded distinct, but largely dissimilar, systems and schools of thought in the pre-modernist era that have had far-reaching impacts on subsequent Islamic reformist movements worldwide. The eighteenth century is dismissed by many Arab writers as 'ahd al-inhitàt (the era of retrogression), and some orientalists designated it the "Dark Age" of Islam. While the latter nomenclature is inappropriate and objec tionable because it mixes up Islam with the history of Muslims,1 the then three major Muslim political entities — the Ottoman Sultanate/Caliphate (1289-1923), the Mughul (1526-1858) and Safavid (1500-1776) "gunpowder" * I am grateful to the Research Centre, International Islamic University Malaysia for funding this research. 1 In an attempt to universalize the European historical pathway, Westerners peri odize world history into three major periods: ancient; medieval, often called the "dark age", which extends from the fifth to the fifteenth century; and modern. This classification, however, completely ignores the experiences of other societies, particularly that of the Muslims where the so-called "dark age" was, in reality, the golden age of Islam (Arif, 2001:206).

Their political and socio-economic institutions disinte grated, and extensive moral degeneration spread throughout their territo ries. The Islamic 'aqïdah (faith) and way of life were gradually adulterated by the rising cultural and physical Westernization, and, more importantly, by the entrenched local customs and religions, notably Hinduism and tra ditional ("pagan") religions. As had been the case throughout Muslim his tory, a mujaddid2 or mujaddids were bound to emerge to address this takhlït (eclecticism or associationism) and laxness. The first reactions by Muslim thinkers to this decay and weakness were religious in origin and expres sion, and not national. We have credible evidence to contend that Shaykh Muhammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb and Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Rahim, popularly known by the pseudonyms Shah Wall Allah al-Dihlâwï,3 were the two most important mujaddids in the entire eighteenth-century Muslim world. This paper does not, and cannot, aspire to study the rich and complex legacies of these two monumental mujaddis. It is just a preliminary attempt to compare and contrast some aspects of their lives and thought that may indicate that they masterminded and spearheaded two distinct, but largely dissimilar, systems and schools of thought in the history of pre-modernist Islamic reformism. The Shaykh and the Shah were contemporaries, perhaps born in the same year (1703), though the former (died 1791) lived much longer than the latter (died 1762). They shared the same mission, namely, disassociat ing Islam from al-bida' (heresies or un-Islamic practices) through rejecting al-taqlïd (blind imitation) and advocating al-ijtihâd (creative reasoning in jurisprudence), and to return with it to its original pristine purity. Both men were, thus, basically concerned with the problems of faith rather than of their countries overrun by foreigners. They were qualified in scholar ship to claim the job and, like almost all previous and subsequent Islamic reformists, belonged to buyüt 'ilm (houses of learning). The Shaykh's fam ily excelled in the field of the Shan'ah law, and monopolized the position of qadï (judge) in their hometown of al-'Uwayynah in Najd, Arabia. The Shah's ancestors were distinguished experts in Islamic education. His father, 2 The synonym of the Quranic term islah (Islamic reformism) is the Hadith term tajdîd (revivalism). Literally, a mujaddid is a "renewer", but in this jurisprudenic con text, he is a revitalizer of Islam; However, a mujaddid is not a unique or an escha tological figure, nor a guardian of esoteric knowledge. 3 Shah (the great) is an Indian title, Wall Allah is a Sufi term that literally means "friend of Allah". Dihlàwï is derived from his birth place of Dehli, an ancient Indian town and capital of the Mughul Empire, whose pronunciation was later changed by the British to read "Delhi", and is currently the capital of India.</page><page sequence="3">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb and Shâh Wall Allah • 105 Shah 'Abd al-Rahlm (died 1719), founded the famous Rahlmiyyah school in Dehli,4 named after him, and was one of the compilers of Fatâwi-ï 'Alamgîrï,5 an encyclopaedic work on Islamic law (essentially a collection of Jatàwa or religious edicts) commissioned by the Mughul Emperor Aurangzeb (1658-1707), nicknamed "the saviour of Islam" for his role in fighting syn creticism and consolidating the rule of Islam in India. Nonetheless, the Shaykh and the Shâh had markedly different back grounds, and experienced different climatic and social environments. The former was born in an extremely tough region in the heart of the Arabian peninsula; Arabia Deserta, as the Romans called it,6 and lived the simple and harsh Bedouin life where people had often to survive on al-aswadayyn (dates and water). He adhered to the rigorous Hanbalï madhhab,1 and had all his education, including his years in al~Haramayyn al-Sharrfayyn (the two holy shrines, Mecca and Medina) under traditional and conservative teach ers who concentrated on the Qur'ân and Sunnah (tradition of the Prophet (S.A.W.)) to the marginalization and perhaps total neglect of other Islamic disciplines such as Sufism (mysticism) and 'ilm al-kalàm (theology). 'Abd al Wahhàb prototype was the famous ultra-salafi Ibn Taymiyyah (1263—1327), who seemed to have had a profound impact on his attitude and thought. Al-Shaykh spent all his life in the isolated Arabian peninsula, which had hardly any contact with the West. Its society was, and still is, largely homo geneous in the sense that nearly all the population are ethnically Arab, speak the same language of Arabic, and practise Sunni Islam, though a minority adheres to Shfism. The Shâh, on the other hand, was born, grew up in and lived most of his life in the relatively mild climate of India. He did not plead for one or another of the four madhhabs or accepted, so to speak, the absolute finality of any of them. Rather, with his reconciliatory approach to differences of opinion among Muslim scholars, he advocated that it is within the right of any Muslim to opt for one madhhab in a particular, or a number, of issues, though the Shâh appeared to have personally favoured the Mâlikï and Hanafï madhhabs. The Shâh had a comparatively diversified educa tional experience, including his fruitful 12 years in his father's school, al Rahïmiyyah, and his 14 months of study (1731—32) in Hadïth and Mâlikï law 4 The British destroyed al-Rahïmiyyah school in 1857, but the Shah's students founded Dar al-'Ulüm in Deobond on its model. 5 Alamgiñ is a Persian word that means "king of kings" or "ruler of the world", and the reference here is to Sultan Aurangzeb (d. 1706). 6 The other two parts were Arabia Putra (mountainous northern Arabia) and Arabicus Felix (happy Yemen). 7 Mathhab (Plural mathàhib) is a school of Islamic Jurisprudence. 8 The Shaykh and the Shàh studied in Medina in about the same time, and</page><page sequence="4">106 • Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim in al-Haramayyn al-Sharïfayyn under Arab teachers.8 Besides the Qur'ân and Sunnah, he was exposed to other Islamic disciplines, notably, Sufism and 'ilm al-kalâm, and was encouraged to read the works of early Muslim thinkers and philosophers such as Abü Hâmid al-Ghazâlï (1058-1111) and Muhyi al-Dln ibn 'Arabï (1165—1240). While the Shaykh was unilingual in Arabic only, the Shah was well versed in at least three major languages — Persian, Arabic and Urdu, which he used to articulate his thoughts in numerous works. Contrary to Arabia, India was predominantly diversified — reli giously, ethnically, linguistically and politically. Islam was a minority reli gion vis-a-vis the popular Buddhism and Hinduism. The Shàh's model and inspirer was mujaddid al-alf al-thànï (the mujaddid of the second millennium) Ahmad Sirhindi (1564—1624), who conducted an original "intellectual renais sance" in the Indian context as reflected in his magnum opus, Maktûbât (epistles or letters).9 Ahl al-Hadïth (adherents to the tradition), who played a major role in the early Muslim struggles against the presumably deviant Shi'ah, Mu'ta Zilah]l) and Khawarij,n had once more taken on the job of purification of Islam, this time against deviant Sufism, which had challenged mainstream Sunnl Islam since the thirteenth century. The remarkable Ibn Taymiyyah had distinguished between two Sufi paths. The first, 'alâ wajh shar'i, was legitimate (Sunnï Sufism) and the second, 'aid wajh bida'ï, was illegitimate and un-Islamic (deviant Sufism). The latter adulterated "puritan" Sufism by certain alien beliefs and practices, such as wahdat al-wujüd (unity of exis tence or being) and the worship of saints and veneration of tombs, which were acquired from various regions of the gradually Islamized world. These bida' transgressed Ibn Taymiyyah's three-dimensional understanding of the doctrine of al-tawhïd (divine unity) that had been literally adopted by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb: tawhïd al-rubübiyyah (belief in the creator), tawhïd al-ulühiyyah (unity of 'ibàdah (worship)) solely of Allah (S.W.T.), and tawhïd al-asmâ' wa al-sifàt that rejected anthropomorphism, which treated God as human in form and personality. Ibn Taymiyyah may have tolerated some forms of Sufism, but his extremist student, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb, exaggerated its probably under the same teachers but there is no direct evidence that they had contact with each other. 9 See below, p. 107. 10 Al-Mu'tazilah was a name given to a theologian school that flourished in the ninth century. It stressed human free will and introduced speculative dogmatism in Islam. Its opponents dismissed it as an infidel sect, mainly because of its pre sumed unacceptable limitation on the power of God. 11 Al-Kkawárij, that is, "those who had gone out of the community of the faith ful", was the name given to the first deviant sect in Islam which played a violent and destructive role during the last two years of the caliphate of 'All ibn Abî Tàtib and the Umayyad period.</page><page sequence="5">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab and Shah Wall Allàh • 107 danger. He rigorously rejected Sufism outright as a whole, and led an all out campaign against all its beliefs and practices, including the presumed baraka (blessing) of its walls (saints) and the holiness of their qibâb (tombs), which he dismissed as outright shirk (polytheism). The Wahhâbists12 seemed to have occasionally gone over the border by allegedly committing such acts as dismanding the grave of the Prophet, and ordering the burning of the famous Sufi work, Kitâb Dald'il al-Kajyrdt. Though the Shaykh and his students denied all these charges,13 they admitted that some of their fol lowers may have had some excesses for which, they protested, they should not be held responsible Nonetheless, the Shaykh's opponents condemned his "dogmatism" and accused him of preaching a "new religion". They argued that a measure of Sufism, which preaches tazkiat al-nafs (purification of the soul) is essential in Sunni Islam, as had been emphasized a long time ago by al-Ghazàlï in Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal (deliverer from ignorance). Conversely, Sufism was accepted and acknowledged in the Indian sub continent, where four main Sufi tarïqas (orders) flourished: the Naqshaban diyyah, the Qâdiriyyah, Chistï, and Sahrawardï.14 Ahmad Sirhindl was himself a Naqshabandr, and his disciple, Shah Wall Allah, was profoundly influenced by Sufism, though he may not have been a practicing Sufi. Rather than obliterating Sufism altogether, the Indian reformists tried to reform it, and had specifically reacted against the superstition and abuses into which it had fallen, both in the realm of theory and practice. While Sirhindl gave an alternate, Wahdat al-Shuhüd (unity of manifestation or appearance), to Ibn 'Arabl's Wahdat al-Wujüd (unity of existence),15 the Shah tried to reconcile the two concepts by arguing that they were basically the same, the difference being in terminology only. The Shah had, in fact, 12 The followers of Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhàb are more commonly known as Wahhàbis, but they insist on calling themselves al-Muwahhidün (believers in al tawhld), and their movement Harakat al-Tawhïd (Unitarian Movement) and not Wahhàbism. 13 For a detailed account of these charges and the Wahhâbi responses to them, see Ministry of High Education, vol. 2, 1983:5-288. 14 The Naqshabandiyyah, a Sufi order founded by Shaykh Ahmad Bahà' al Dein in the town of Naqshaband, Bukhara, Central Asia, had spearheaded Islamic revivalism in the Indian sub-continent. The other three major Sufi orders — the Chisti (named after its Asian birthplace in the town of Chist in Northern Afghanistan), the Sahrawardi and the Qâdriyya — had all come to the Indian sub-continent around the thirteenth century. Their founders were, respectively, Khawâjah Abü Ishàq Shiâmi (d. 941), Shaykh Shihâb al-Dein Shahrawardï (d. 1231) and Shaykh 'Abd al-Qâdir al-Gaylànï (d. 1166). 15 Besides reforming Sufism, Sirhindi should be commended for suppressing the movement of Din Ilàhï of Sultan Akbar (1542-1605) that had gravely threatened Islam in India.</page><page sequence="6">108 • Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim avoided the Shaykh's extremism over this issue by suggesting "a process of sublimation"16 to condone such acts as visiting saints' tombs or believ ing in the intercession of the Prophet (S.A.W.). Besides, again unlike 'Abd al-Wahhàb, the Shah was very careful not to dismiss outright any of the Sufis as apostate because, in his words in al-Tafhïmàt al-Ilâhiyyah, "We do not possess any authority from the Legislator to do so in a case such as theirs". Yet, he mildly added, "as a matter of principle, any person who prays to a dead one for the fulfilment of his desires, thinking that he is alive, corrupts his heart with sin" (Mawdüdí, 1979:81-82). The Intellectual Legacy of the Shaykh and the Shah At the outset of this part of the discourse, it may be appropriate to record some of the major titles for each of the two mujaddids, as this may help to give, at a glance, a quick idea of their scope and major themes. The following are some of the titles of the works — all in Arabic — written by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhàb:17 Kitàb al-Tawhïd (A Book on Unitarianism) Kitab al-Kabâ'ir (A Book on Major Sins) Masà'il al-Jâkilliyyah (Issues on the Age of Ignorance) Nasïhat al-Muslimïn (Advice to Muslims) Kashf al-Shubuhdt (Uncovering the Doubtful) Al-Huda al-Nabaim (Prophetic Guidance) Below are a few major titles of the over 50 works of Shah Wall Allah, writ ten in Arabic, Persian and Urdu: Hujah Allah al-Balighah (Conclusive Argument from God). This was the Shah's magnum opus, which he wrote between 1732 and 1738, and for which he claimed to have received divine inspiration in Makkah to write it. TaJhïmât-ï-Ilâhïya (Instructions or Clear Understanding). This is a col lection of lectures that the Shah gave on some Sufist and theo logical issues. 16 The "process of sublimation" had in essence emphasized the necessity of com bining a measure of Sufi faith with orthodox (salafi) theology, leading to what may be called neo-sufism or positive Sufism. (Fazlur Rahman, 1970:639-40). 17 The university of Imam Muhammed ibn Sa'üd, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, com piled the works of Shaykh Muhammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhàb in twelve volumes published under the title Mu'alafât (Works) al-Shaykh ai-Imam Muhammed ibn 'Abd al Wahhàb.</page><page sequence="7">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab and Shah Wall Allah • 109 Al-Budür al-Bazighah (Full Moons Rising in the Horizon).

Al-Fawz al-Kabïr fi Usui al-Tafsîr (The Fundamentals of the Exegesis) Al-Juz' al-Latïf fi Taijamat al-'Abd al-Da'ïf This is an autobiography of the Shah. By the eighteenth century, Muslims in some parts of the world, especially in the Ottoman Caliphate and India, were already acquainted with the West and Western civilization. This did not, however, seem to have been the case in the desert and in the isolated regions of central Arabia where Wahhàbism started and flourished. Being presumably unaware of an imme diate or prospective Western challenge or threat, the Shaykh did not respond in his scholarship to this external factor. Surprisingly, however, the Shah did not also appear to have taken due notice of the fast emerging Europe, even after the English seizure of Bengal during his own time, and the expansion of their influence as far as Allahabad (Mawdüdí, 1979:98).18 Like his teacher, Sirhindî, the Shah was concerned with bringing "new unity and vigour to the faith at a time of division and discouragement" (Lewis, 1968:97) rather than with any infidel threat. The Shaykh's scholarship had, therefore, concentrated on what he considered to be the main challenge to Islam, namely, innovation in the realm of religious doctrine and practice. As may be noticed at a glance from his above titles, he focused on the perfection of the 'aqidah (faith) as he understood it, and on the sole basis of the Qur'an and Sunnah. To him, the first and foremost duty of the state is to uphold the divine law, and to see to it that all Muslims strictly observe all the 'ibâdât (rituals and 18 Europeans arrived at India as early as the sixteenth century, first the Portuguese who were followed by the Dutch, English, French and others. Dogmatic Catholicism was another threat to Islam in India.</page><page sequence="8">110* Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim religious duties). If they do not, or even depart from the dogmatic manner that he dictated for their fulfilment, the state should compel them to do so. To perform this and other functions, King 'Abd al-'Azïz (d. 1953), the founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, founded in 1910-1912 a spe cial institution, al-Ikhwàn (The Brothers). Following their revolt in 1929,19 al-Ikhwân were superseded by al-Muttawïawün, singular muttawi' or enforcer of religious morality. Anybody who rejected Wahhâbism, or any of its aus tere doctrines such as the strict prohibition of al-sama'wa al-raqs (music and dance), would be declared an apostate, and a jihad, would be waged against him. In short, the original Wahhâbi theological position had apparendy been extremely limited in scope, literal and dry, and tended to reduce reli gion to a set of rules.20 Conversely, the Shah's scholarship focused on two major scholarly themes that were hardly addressed by his contemporary. First is what Professor Zafar Ansâri called "Islamic intellectual emphasis or orientation" (Ansârî, 1973:12). In many of his works, like the Hujah and al-Budür, the Shah urged Muslims, particularly their leaders, to profoundly comprehend and reflect on the meaning of the Qur'an and the Sunnah to discover what he called Asràr al-Dïn (the "secrets" of the Shan'ah). This would help them to understand not only God's ahkàm (injunctions and ordinances) but, more importantly, their wisdom and noble objectives (Wali Allah, n.d.: 9 and 31). Having this principle in mind, the Shah was one of the early Muslim scholars who departed from the dogmatic position of the traditional 'ulemâ which prohibited the translation of the Qur'an into other languages on the grounds that the Arabic text is the only true text, and that its translation would, thus, be a grave sin and a violation of its sanctity. In his book, Muqaddimah fi Taijamat al-Qur'ân al-Kañm, the Shah firmly argued that the Fjaz (miraculous nature) of the Qur'ân is not only in its literary beauty and perfection, but, more importantly, in its teachings. It was meant to 19 The Ikhwàn revolted against King 'Abd al-'Azïz's modernizing policies and his alliance with the British "infidels". But the King refused to compromise and slaugh tered them in the battle of al-Sablah (Rawdat al-Sablah) in 1929 ('Abd al-'Aziz, 1992:176-183, and Wilson and Graham, 1994:44—46). Interestingly, an analogy is nowadays made between al-Ikhwân and al-Qà'idah, and some Saudi intellectuals has reportedly warned the Saudi family that the only way to save their shaky regime would be through a Sabla type operation against the militant Islamists (Zakariya, June 2004:15). 20 Subsequently, however, the Wahhàbis relaxed this dogmatism, and removed many of the restrictions imposed by the Shaykh and his immediate successors. Hence was the gradual shift, since the time of the second Wahhâbi state (1823-1891), from the so-called "fundamental" Wahhâbism to "pragmatic" Wahhàbism (Voll, 1982: 128-30).</page><page sequence="9">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb and Shah Wall Allah «111 be read and its fundamentals understood and practiced. Notwithstanding the 'Ulama"s charge of apostasy against him, the Shah in 1738 translated the Qur'an into simple Persian, then into the literary language in India under the tide, Fath al-Rahman Ji Tajamat al-Qur'an, published in 1743. His objective "was primarily to convey the word of God in translation to the average educated Muslim, and secondarily to break the monopoly of the 'ulemâ', who had become petty-minded, far too occupied with the exter nalities of the rituals" (Chapter IX:205).21 Later, his son, Rail' al-Dln, trans lated the Qur'an into Urdu for the first time. This was. however, a "literal rendering" that was followed by "a more idiomatic" one done by his other son, 'Abd al-Qâdir (Chapter IX:205). The other major theme of the Shah's intellectual legacy, of which we find no trace whatsoever in his contemporary's works, dealt with some interesting philosophical and socio-political issues. This discourse demon strates the Shah's deep insight and intellect, and his distinguished role in the reconstruction of Islamic religious thought in the pre-modernist age. While his style, in terms of interpretation, was salafi, "his goal was recon ciliation, not condemnation" (Voll, 1982:65). Indeed, he deserves the metaphor of forming a bridge between salafi and modern Islamic thought in the Indian sub-continent. There is no place in this brief paper — and no need too — for an exhaustive narrative on this aspect of the Shah's scholarship, which had been sufficiently studied in many works, particularly Muhammad al-Ghazàlfs scholarly book, The Socio-political Thought of Shah Wall Allah (Islamabad, 2001).22 It suffices for our purposes here to give a bird's-eye view on the Shàh's input on those issues. He articulated the distinguished status that Allah (S.W.T.) gave to Man in this universe, and his empowerment vis-a vis the baheimah (animal), by what the Shah called al-ra'i al-kullï (universal ity of vision or purpose) and al-garâfah (Wali Allah, n.d.:9()-91), which means "perfect signs", "moral excellence", "social temptation" or "aesthetic sense". In some of his works, such as al-Khilàfâh al-Ràshidah and Izâlat al Khafà', the Shah wrote extensively on politics, particularly on the Caliphate and its development as the supreme political institution of Muslim polity. Unlike many of the early Muslim thinkers, including Ibn Khaldün, the Shah distinguished between al-Kildfah al-fijihirah and al-Kilâfah al-Batinah. The first, the external caliphate, was a succession to the Prophet (S.A.W.) in mundane matters and should, thus, occupy itself with the duties of the 21 An Indian scholar, Qazi Shihàb ai-Din Dawlatâbadi, undertook an earlier Persian translation of the Qur'an, "but it was more in the nature of a commentary". (Chapter IX: 205). 22 I wrote a review of al-Ghazàli's book which had been published in Intellectual Discourse, 9, 1, 2001:103-6.</page><page sequence="10">112» Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim administration and defence of religious law; the second, the internal caliphate, would be entrusted with spiritual concerns, particularly guidance to the 'Ulamâ'. Besides, the Shah gave his input on the qualifications and duties of the Caliph as well as the methods and procedure for his selection and deposition. Most interesting is the Shah's socio-anthropological basis for the emer gence and development of societies until they reach perfection. According to him, in the Hujah and al-Büdür, this process takes place through the four-stage doctrine of "al-irtifâqât", which concerned itself with the prob lems of virtue and vice or progress and decline. In the first of these four irtifàqât, which he called "al-madhhab al-tabfï" — the natural or primitive stage — man strived to ensure the continuation of his existence. After the first stage, five hikam (singular hikmah, which literally means "wisdom" but in this context, better as "skill") are needed to complete the second irtifàq\ namely, al-hikmah al-ma'âshiyyah (economic skill), al-iktisàbiyyah (earning), al manziliyyah (household), al-ta'âmulliyyah (business) and al-ta'âwunïyyah (coop erative). The interaction between these "hikam" would lead to the third irtifâq, the formation of the madinah (city or state). Finally is the fourth irtifâq, the formation of al-khilâfah al-kubrâ (the great Caliphate), the ideal Islamic state that can only be realized in a perfect and developed society.23 Incidentally, one is intrigued by the word "irtifâq" which, to the best of my knowledge, does not literally mean "stage" in the Arabic language.24 Perhaps the Shah derived it from the Arabic word "rifq" (gentleness) and then used it metaphorically to mean smooth transfer from one stage to the other. It is quite likely that in his discourse of al-irtifâqât. The Shah was somehow influenced by Ibn Khaldün's (1332-1406) famous theory of " 'Ilm al-'Umrân" (science of social organization), which articulates the rise and development of civilizations from al-badàwah (primitive stage) through al tamadun until they reach their nadir, al-imrân, after which they would fall due to the weakness of the 'asabiyyah (ruling elite) and the spread of al Zjilm (oppression and injustice) (Ibn Khaldün, n.d.: 172-174). Muhammed ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb assumed for himself a universal mis sion, that is, to reform Islam everywhere and, if necessary, at the edge of the sword. This universality may be seen in his decision to start his da'wah (call) during the early 1740s in Basra, which is not only outside Najd but the Arabian peninsula altogether, and in the challenge that he and his movement posed to the Ottoman Caliphate. With the support of the local 23 For the Shah's complete text on the Irtifàqât, see Wali Allah, n.d.:38-49. Dr. Abdul Azim Islahi wrote an article on this issue in the Journal of Objective Studies, 1, January 1990:46^59). 24 An author translated an irtifâq as a device, and added that from the context the term may also mean a whole period of history (Enstitoso, Iqbal, 2, 3, 1963:1).</page><page sequence="11">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhdb and Shah Wall Allah *113 Amir of the house of Sa'üd, Muhammed, Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhàb launched in 1744 a militant campaign that founded a puritanical Wahhâbi rule in the Emirate of al-Dar'aiyyah. From this base, his followers entered, just a decade after his demise, into a long and bloody confrontation with the Ottomans that achieved a political outcome in their control in 1803 of al Haramayyn al-Sharlfayyn and, subsequently, the formation of three indepen dent Wahhâbi states: the first 1803-1818; the second 1823-1891; and the third, the present Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since 1902. In the current terminology, the Shaykh was radical and uncompromising with all the exist ing institutions of his society, which he strived to destroy and replace with new ones. In short, he wanted to achieve change revolutionarily and speedily. The death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1706, just four years after the birth of the Shah, was a serious blow to Islam in India. It marked the collapse of Muslim power, disintegration of Muslim morale and the rise of anti-Muslim forces in the sub-continent. Being well aware of this dan gerous change in the political situation and its consequential inherent threats, Shah Wall Allah advocated a reform-oriented approach. Anybody who professed Islam should be encouraged to remain so whatever his sins or failings were. Use of force to compel people to accept Islam and abide by its rituals and doctrines would be counter-productive, as they would revert to their ancestors' faith once they had an opportunity to do so. The best strategy would, therefore, be to persuade them into the acceptance of Islam by precept and example. To overcome this critical situation, the Shah maintained that Islam had to be liberal, resilient, composite and tolerant toward both Muslims and non-Muslims. Unlike the Shaykh, the Shah real ized that constructive change in the complex Indian setting could only come in inches rather than feet, and that wisdom could not be achieved overnight but over the years. Interestingly, the Shah was strongly drawn to the Arabs and Arabia, the source of authentic Islam "undefiled by Persian and Indian accretions". He wrote "We are strangerous in this land (of India). Our fathers and grandfathers came to live here from abroad. For us, Arab descent and the Arabic language are causes of pride, these two things bring us nearer to the Lord of the First and the Last, the noblest of Prophets and Apostles . .. We must give thanks to God for this grace by holding on as much as pos sible to the customs and traditions of the ancient Arabs, from whom the Prophet came and to whom he addressed himself, and by safeguarding ourselves from the penetration of Persian traditions and Indian habits" (Lewis, 1968:97-98).25 He deliberately wrote several of his important works, 25 Lewis took this quotation from Bansansi, A., "Note Sir Shah Wall Allah di Delhi (1703-1762)" Anualidell Instituto Universitario Orientale di Napoli, n.s.x (1961), p. 99.</page><page sequence="12">114» Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim notably his magnum opus, Hujat Allah al-Bàlighah, in Arabie instead of the more customary Persian, presumably to address himself to a larger audi ence in the Arab Islamic world. His book, Anfàs al-'Arïjîn, consists of sev eral rasâ'il (messages) of which the third, al-Imdàd jï Màthir al-Ajdâd, proudly enumerates the glorious achievements of his Arab ancestors (Islam, forth coming). His son, Shah 'Abd al-'AzIz, and two of his students, al-Shaykh Muhammed Murtadâ al-Zabïdï of Bilgram (1732-1791) and the Kurdish Shaykh Khâlid Diva' al-Dln (1775-1826), continued the Shah's idealiza tion of the Arabs. The latter visited India in 1809, and Al-Zabîdï trav elled to Arabia and Egypt where he made a tangible contribution in the revival of Arab culture toward the end of the eighteenth century. Like some earlier seventeenth-century Indian Muslim thinkers, the Shah had, indeed, exercised important but little known influence on his co-religion ists in the Arab world (Lewis, 1968:96-97, and Voll, 1982:59). We do not have credible evidence to suggest that 'Abd al-Wahhàb had followed the established tradition of many of the prominent Muslim scholars and mujaddids to communicate with their students, disciples and the notables.26 The Shah did, however, follow this practice, and his addressees were from within and outside India, for example, Emperor Shah Abdâle of Afghanistan, to whom the Shah appealed for direct physical interven tion to suppress the anarchy and corruption of the Hindu forces of the Jats and Marathas. Many of these letters have been compiled for easy ref erence by some of the Shah's relatives, students and friends, notably his cousin and brother-in-law, Shâh Muhammed Tshiq, who collected 282 of these epistles in two volumes. These were subsequently enlarged to 352 and edited by his son, Shah 'Abd al-Rahmàn, himself a student of the Shah. Indeed, these epistles constitute a primary source for the Shah's socio-political thought and his vision of the Muslim world.27 Interestingly also, the Shah, unlike the Shaykh, wrote his autobiography under the title Al-Juz' al-Latïf fl Tarjamat al-'Abd al-Da'if (The Best Part of the Autobiography of the Weak Slave of God). The Impact of the Shaykh and the Shah Both the Shaykh and the Shah had profound and deep impact on subse quent Muslim thought and activism not only in their localities, the Arabian peninsular and the Indian sub-continent, but throughout the Muslim world. 26 This tradition seemed to have been well established in India. The maktübat (letters) of Sirhindï and Sayyid Ahmad Shàhid (d. 1831), and the letters of Maulânâ 'Air ThanwF (d. 1943) to Qaid A'zam Muhammed 'Alïjinnah (d. 1948), the founder of Pakistan, are among the prominent examples in this regard. 27 For more information about the Shâh's letters and their significance, see Al-Ghazali, 2001:127-29, and Islam (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="13">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhâb and Shah Wall Allah *115 Though the full Wahhàbi doctrine found few die-hard adherents in the Muslim world, the tremendous religious awakening that it brought influenced Muslims in many lands — the Arab world, central and south east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa — and infused them with a new mili tancy against eclecticism and the impending struggle against the European invaders. Moreover, the Wahhàbi condemnation of Sufi beliefs and prac tices provoked a vigorous Sufi revival that was spearheaded by such renowned Sufi leaders as Ahmad ibn Idris al-FasI (died 1837), and tañqas like al Khalwatiyyah and al-Tijàniyyah. For centuries, but particularly in the eight eenth and nineteenth centuries, some African students sought study in the Arab East: al-Azhar in Egypt and Mecca and Medina in Arabia. They had contact with the Salafi tradition there and on their return home, advo cated its ideas and teaching, including opposition to the prevalent practice of "saint-worship" in Africa. Moreover, though strongly inclined towards Sufism, the nineteenth-century leaders of the Jihad, in Bilàd al-Südanfi notably Shaykh 'Uthmân Dân Fodio (1754—1817), Shaykh Ahmad Lobbo (born about 1773), Hâji TJmar (died 1864), the Sudanese Mahdi Muhammed Ahmed ibn 'Abdullah (1840-1885) and Muhammed Abdille ('Abdullah) Hasan (1864—1920) of Somaliland, were all influenced by the Wahhâbi puritanical revivalism.29 Later, the elitist West African Muslim association, Subannu al-Muslimtn, that was transformed in 1953 into a larger cultural organization called the Muslim Cultural Union, was committed to the Wahhàbi doctrine, particularly in the field of education (Fisher, 1970:403-404). The Muslim Brotherhood of Hasan al-Bana (1906—1949) and the Jamàt-e Islàmï of Abü 'Alá Mawdüdí (1903-1977), as well as many other Salafi movements worldwide were, and still are, influenced in one way or another by Wahhàbi radicalism. The original Wahhàbist doctrine has provided, though in a much diluted form, the ideological basis for the present Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Al-Qa'idah of Usâmah bin Laden and other contempo rary "jihadist", often dubbed "terrorist", groups, notably al-Takfir wa al Hijrah30 of Egypt, are grounded on the extreme Wahhàbist form of Islam, 28 The Arabs coined the term Bilad al-Südán (the land of the blacks) for the huge belt that is sandwiched between the Great Sahara in the North and the forest zone in the South, and which extends from the Atlantic in the west to the Red Sea in the east. Earlier they gave the nomenclature Bilàd al-Bldan (the land of the whites) to Africa north of the great desert. 29 For a good summary of the career of these mujâhidXn (holy warriors for the cause of Islam), see UNESCO, 1989:537-635 and Knut, 1999:80-98. 30 The three elements of al-takfir (declaration of an unjust ruler as infidel), al hijra (withdrawal of the mujahidün beyond his domain) and al-jihâd (launching an external attack on him) were historically inextricably linked, and has been widely used since the time of Almoravids (al-Murâbitûn) of North Africa. Another mod ern example is Amîr 'Abd al-Q_àdir (1808-1883) of Algeria (Knut, 1999:80-93).</page><page sequence="14">116* Hassan Ahmed Ibrahim which, incidentally, the West is currently striving to substitute by the Kemalist version that has largely contributed to the secularization and de Islamization of post-Ottoman Turkey. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, India was in turmoil. The Mughul Empire was no longer effective, the Indian sub-continent was divided into hostile states, the Sikhs strengthened their grip and, most importantly, the English expanded their influence and control. In the face of these dangerous developments, the Shah's tradition constituted the most important intellectual force for the series of jihàd movements that his stu dents waged during and since the nineteenth century against Sikh domi nance and British imperialism. Following the British occupation of Delhi in 1803, the Shah's son, Shah 'Abd al-'Azïz, declared India Dâr Harb (an abode of war) and orga nized Tahrïkh al-Mujàhidûn (The Movement of the Holy Warriors) in cen tral and northwest India. This had become particularly dynamic under the leadership of his student, Ahmed Brelwi who was supported by some mem bers of Walt Allah's family, including his son Shah Isma'il. Inspired by the ideas of Wall Allah, Brelwi united all Sufi tarîqas under Al-Tarïqah al Muhammadiyyah, and waged a vigorous jihad to restore Muslim rule in India. He achieved initial success by controlling Peshawar in 1830 and declaring the Caliphate but he was soon overpowered by the Sikhs, who killed him in battle in 1831. Mawdûdï attributed the drastic failure of this massive jihàd to what he called an "overdose of Sufism" — poor prepa ration and the inability of the leadership to comprehend and give due attention to the rising power of the British, and not the Sikhs, who had then constituted the real and immediate threat to Islam in India (Mawdûdï, 1979:91—99). The era of large-scale militant Muslim uprisings, however, reached its climax in the 1857 all-out Indian revolt, which was mercilessly crushed by the British, who killed its leader Imdâd Allah and occupied India in 1858. Some Western writers and politicians categorized the nineteenth-cen tury Indian Islamic reformism as "Indian Wahhâbism" but this movement's parallelism with the numerous Wahhabi revolts in Arabia may not fully justify this juxtaposition. For the Indian jihàd was essentially an indigenous religious revival that was based on the authentic teaching of Shah Wall Allah, and focused on the fight of the "infidels" — be it the British or the Sikhs — while the Wahhâbis strove to free Arab lands from the author ity of the Ottoman Sultan, whom they denounced as heretic and usurper. The Wahhàbi revolution had, in fact, marked "a first withdrawal of con sent from Ottoman Turkish supremacy" (Lewis, 1968:99). Thus, the nomen clature "Indian Wahhâbism" is rather inappropriate, and appears to be politically loaded and designed to condemn the struggle of the Indian Muslims against British imperialism by the customary and stereotypical charges of dogmatism and xenophobia.</page><page sequence="15">Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-WahhSb and Shah Wall Allah *117 The failure of the 1857 jihad marked a watershed in the history of Islam in India. Though radical movements continued to appear from time to time, many Muslim leaders accepted, perhaps reluctantly, the reality of British military dominance and like Muhammed 'Abduh ( 1849— 1905) of Egypt, they set out to reform within the context of foreign domination. Interestingly, these Indian "modernists" had also claimed to have based their "reorientation of Islam" on the inspiration and thought of Shah Wall Allah. Chief among them is Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-1898), the founder of the "Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College" at Aligarh, which had subsequently developed into a full-fledged university and has become a major centre of Islamic modernist education in India.31 The Shah's concept of ijtihad had seemingly also influenced 'Allâma Muhammad Iqbàl (d. 1938). The Shah has his fingerprints in the Malay world. The Malays of Malaysia, for example, have been acquainted with his teachings through Haj Nik Abdullah bin Haj Wan Musa (1900-1935), a Kelantanese 'âlim (jurist) who had the opportunity to study the Shah's scholarship, particu larly his Sufi vision, during his study in Mecca in 1926 (Dali, 2003:10). Conclusion The Shaykh and the Shah shouldered the same mission, namely, to purify Islam and realize its basic teachings as they understood them. Yet, the different backgrounds and social settings that they experienced, as well as the dissimilar challenges that they faced triggered different visions, approaches and responses. While the Shaykh was largely a literalist and a "hair split ter", the Shàh was significantly tolerant and accommodative. Compared to the Shaykh, he possessed a many-sided, versatile personality, and pro duced a substantial and substantive intellectual legacy. Mawdûdï com mended the Shàh by suggesting that he was "the first scholar who ever understood the real and fine difference between the history of Islam and the history of Muslims" (Mawdûdï, 1979:74). Mawdûdï also commended 31 While highly praised in the west, Sir Sayyid is very controversial in the Muslim World. Jamâl al-Dtn al-Afghâm (1837-1897), for example, condemned him as an agent of British imperialism and the then ringleader of al-Dah.riu.wn (the atheists), but Abu al-Hasan 'Alt al-Nadwï (d. 1999) commended his realistic and pragmatic role in promoting the interests of the Muslims. For Afghani's arguments, see his book in Persian that had been translated by Muhammed Abdu in Arabic under the title Al-Rad 'alâ al-Dahriyyîn (The Refutation of the Materialists), Cairo 1960.

In short, the Shaykh and the Shah were the custodians of two dis trict, and most important, schools of thought in the pre-modern Muslim world. In this sense, they were not competitors, but partners in a world that was dominated by rising challenges to Islam.
