<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Félix Asensio, et al., Antiguo Testamento. Vol. I: Pentateuco (La Sagrada Escritura: Texto y commentario por profesores de la Compañía de Jesús; Madrid: Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos, 1967). Pp. xxxi-1002; 3 maps. PTS 180. This new commentary on the OT (the NT volumes have already been pub- lished) from B.A.C, is a large and a serious one. This reviewer, however, found it generally disappointing. The commentary on Nm by Frederick Moriarty is good, though very brief and to the point. The commentary on Dt by Rafael Criado is very good. It is up to date and quite ample (pp. 751-996). His intro- duction to Dt is well done as are the excursuses on the feast of Passover, the feast of Weeks, and the Prophet of Dt 18,15-19. There is less to recommend in the commentary on Gn and Lv by Félix Asensio, and in the commentary on Ex by Sebastian Bartina. Asensio's commentary on Gn is curiously out of date. He is acquainted with all the significant modern literature on Gn and takes it into account, but usually only to reject it. His viewpoint is consistently rather conservative; but what I found most disturbing in a serious commentary published in 1967 was the great amount of space devoted to beating dead horses, even though A. usually will acknowledge grudgingly that the horse is dead. A large section of his general introduction to the Pentateuch was devoted to defining the terms ac- cording to which Catholics may hold that Moses is or is not the author of the Pentateuch. In an excursus on the Flood Narrative, A. states in a lead para- graph: "The theological problem of Gn 6-8 is basically the problem as to whether the deluge was or was not universal" (p. 99). He does reject geo- graphic universalism (after discussing the pros and cons of the position), but accepts an anthropological or ethnographical universalism, so that the historical deliverance through the Ark would be a fitting type of the Church, He inter- prets Gn 2,7 in a fundamentalist way. While making allowance for the use of anthropomorphism, A. states that this narrative teaches "a direct and immediate action of God in the formation of man .... There is an affirmation of the fact and - in a general way at least - of the manner. Contrary to its teaching con- cerning the fact would be rigid transformism or evolutionism which holds for a passing from préexistent living matter to man, without divine intervention. Contrary to its teaching concerning the manner [of man's creation] would be mitigated evolutionism which holds for a step from living matter to the human body under the action of God" (p. 39). He holds also for a primitive tradition (of revelation) at the basis of the myths which the Israelite authors trans- formed into their present shape as found in Gn 1-11. He says that the biblical author might have been familiar with the various myths but that he trans- formed them "with a religious feeling that from the human and literary view- point is inexplicable without a special divine intervention" (p. 60). I find little to recommend in the Gn commentary. It contains a great deal of erudition, 600</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 601 but little biblical theology. It is up to date in that it takes into account most of the recent literature, but the viewpoints presented are those of the turn of the century. The commentary on Ex by Bartina is also disappointing. It is heavy on geography and history, but light on theological meaning. It is a very erudite commentary. B.'s viewpoint is generally quite conservative. In his introduction he says, "There are three fundamental things in which it is not possible to deny an action of God which is strictly miraculous , and these three things are irrefutable seals of the divine omnipotence: pure and perfect monotheism, the Decalogue, and the efficacious realization of the plan of salvation ... in the exodus" (p. 298). "The Hebrew Decalogue has not had nor does it have a rival in the entire religious history of humanity.,, This is the sort of extrava- gance that gives apologetics a bad name. B. appears naively fundamentalist at times. Regarding Ex 2,2 he says, "Aaron and Miriam were older, born before the decree of Pharaoh" (p. 314), and he discusses the possibility of identifying the daughter of Pharaoh who found the child Moses. I found his exegesis of Ex 4,24-26 very farfetched (p. 347). The overall judgment on this first volume dealing with the OT would be that the quality is very uneven.
