The head, acquired in 1994, with its prominent nose shows all elements of an idealized Classic Maya représentation of a human head. The eyes are almond-shaped, the mouth is open and the lips are slightly downtumed at the comers, and the nose features an artificially extended nose bridge reaching over the forehead. The head was crowned by a now damaged and eroded headdress. In the area of the chin and the cheeks remains of a red pigment can still be seen. The origin of this life-size modeled stucco head is not known, like the overwhelming majority of comparable anthro pomorphic stucco heads in private and public collections in Mexico, the United States, and Europe (cf. mexicon XI (4):61-62,1989). While for a long time all unprovenanced stucco heads were attributed to the site of Palenque, where the only then known examples of stucco heads existed, in the past years three-dimensional stucco décoration has been found adoming stone buildings all over the Maya Lowlands. In addition to Palenque, well preserved or fragmentary stucco figures and heads have been excavated at Xunantunich, Caracol in Belize, at Copan in Honduras, atTikal, Naachtun, Seibai and Piedras Negras in Guatemala, and at Yaxchilan, Tonina, and Comalcalco in Mexico, to name only a few examples. In the Northern Maya Lowlands figurai stucco décoration, including anthropomorphic heads, seems to have a more restricted distribution but is still found at Puuc sites such as Sayil, Xcalumkin, and Xkipche, at several Chenes sites and sites in the Rio Bec région, such as Becan, Chicanna, and Hormiguero, and also at Mayapan. On stylistical grounds this fragmentary stucco sculpture may be attributed to a site at the base of theYucatan peninsula, where this peculiar art style was prévalent. Chronologically, it can be assigned to the Late Classic period, ca. A.D. 600 - 900. Text: Nikolai Grube and Karl Herbert Mayer Photo: mexicon archives</page></plain_text>
