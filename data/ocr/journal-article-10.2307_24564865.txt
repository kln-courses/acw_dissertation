<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fall of Montezuma: Poetry and History In William Carlos Williams and D.H. Lawrence Bruce Clarke Texas Tech University Near the end of his review of William Carlos Williams' In the American Grain, published in The Nation for April 14, 1926, D. H. Lawrence commented: "It would be easy enough to rise, in critical superiority, as a critic always feels he must, superior to his author, and find fault. The modemist style is sometimes irritating. Was Tenochtitlan really so wonderful? . . . But if an author rouses my deeper sympathy he can have as many faults as he likes, I don't care." And although Lawrence may have had no prior notion of Williams' familiarity with and regard for his work, he probably noticed some hints of it when he reviewed Williams' treatment of American history. In the critical literature on William Carlos Williams there has been a general consensus that D. H. Lawrence's various American studies influenced Williams' composition of In the American Grain, although just which studies and just how influential have never been especially clear (Hyman 96, Guimond 67, Mazzaro 14-15, Doyle 40-41). Moreover, there has been some significant scepticism expressed with regard to Williams' debt to Lawrence. In particular, Linda Welshimer Wagner has stated: "Contrary to the view that Williams' Grain essays are a response to Lawrence's studies, evidence is conclusive that these essays . . . existed at least partly as answer to The Waste Land." Wagner follows up in a footnote: "Considering the fact that three of Williams' Grain essays were published before March of 1923 (Lawrence's book came out in 1923), and that two others followed rapidly, it seems that the impetus for this project must have occurred well before 1923" (66, 200). Wagner is right to emphasize Eliot's role: that impetus did occur before 1923, and Eliot was a part of it; nevertheless, Lawrence still had a significant hand in the project. Thomas Whitaker has also noticed that some of Williams' essays on American themes appeared in the same year as Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature, but sees this concurrence not as a coincidence but as cause and effect: in fact, "the rapidity of Williams' response (as well as a good deal of internal evidence) suggests his acquaintance with Lawrence's essays in the English Review. In 1918 Williams had also written, The New World is Montezuma,' . . . and had imagined a descent to Tenochtidan" (78). Whitaker's leads hold up, and we will follow them to a remarkable intersection between the two writers directly at the figure of Montezuma, at which point the question of influence can be put aside and the task of interpretation taken up. The fate of Montezuma offers the poet of history-the imaginative artist evaluating factual historical materials-a crucial moment of ambivalent moral origin for an ironic, therefore authentic, epic treatment of American culture. Th√ß destruction of Tenochtitlan is colonial America's original sin. The fall of Montezuma before Cortez says something about this New World and about the conquering old world that so rudely and thoroughly appropriated it from the aboriginal civilizations. Somehow "the truth about us," what America is, was bom in this aboriginal collapse and colonial triumph, as "the pure products of America" attest:</page><page sequence="2">Unless it be that marriage perhaps with a dash of Indian blood will throw up a girl so desolate so hemmed round with disease or murder that she'll be rescued by an agent.... voluptuous water expressing with broken brain the truth about us ("To Elsie," I 132) Both Williams and Lawrence saw the importance of the confrontation between Montezuma and Cortez for their respective versions of the American epic, Lawrence for his critical treatment of American literary history, Williams for his literary treatment of historical American heroes. Moreover, they shared a fundamental premise concerning the primary influence of locality, that the body of the landscape determines the character of its inhabitants, as stated for instance in Lawrence's English Review version of the essay "The Spirit of Place": "The place attracts its own human element, and the race drifts inevitably to its own psychic geographical pole. . . . Meat of wild creatures, com of the aboriginal earth, filled and impregnated them with the unknown America. Their subtlest plasm was changed under the radiation of new skies, new influences of light, their first and rarest life-stuff transmuted" (323, 330). I will set out my evidence on these matters, and then comment more generally on the relation of Montezuma and D. H. Lawrence to William Carlos Williams and his writing of the American myth. In June, 1917, T. S. Eliot took over from H.D. and Richard Aldington as assistant editor of the Egoist, the London literary and philosophical journal where Williams had been publishing occasionally but steadily since 1913-an event Williams must have felt as an unwelcome disruption of his London connection.* Kora in Hell and its lively Prologue, dated September 1, 1918, are Williams' first full-scale responses to what he could already foresee as the Eliotian hegemony, an opposition on Williams' part that placed him alongside Lawrence's heretical or and-traditional "new world" stances. By 1918 Williams was explicitly defending rather than bemoaning the undiscovered orders of modernity and the claims of the New World against a London axis which by then had already begun to take Eliot to heart as the savior of American versed Perhaps Williams was thinking of Eliot in Kora in Hell when he imagined some impediment so vast it could be undermined only by a subterranean descent, a joumey to the underworld. Whatever the case, this imaginative descent recovers a vision of Tenochtitlan:</page><page sequence="3">Something to grow used to; a stone too big for ox haul, too near for blasting. Take the road round it or-scrape away, scrape away; a mountain's buried in the dirt! Marry a gopher to help you! Drive her in! Go yourself down along the lit pastures. Down, down. The whole family take shovels, babies and all! Down, down! Here's Tenochtitlan! here's a strange Darien where worms are princes. (I 53; cf. Bruns 74) Williams makes sighting Montezuma's city especially memorable by calling it a "strange Darien." An Aztec city sacked and beaten down by Cortez, by the arrival of the old world to the new, is imagined as an inversion of the "peak in Darien" ("a mountain's buried in the dirt"), the Panamanian mountain-top where Keats had so strangely placed not the historically correct Balboa but Montezuma's nemesis "stout Cortez."^ Williams playfully displaces the awe Keats fictionally attributed to Cortez viewing the new-found Pacific back to what the actual Cortez actually discovered in Tenochtitlan: the baffling hospitality of Montezuma, a pacifistic prince left for the worms by Western history. An opulent, theocratic emperor, Montezuma was the first world-historical figure to fall casualty to the colonization of America. And as Whitaker has noted, in the Prologue to Kora in Hell Williams mentions Montezuma explicitly, specifically in rebutting Eliot's conservatism: "Eliot is a subde conformist. It tickles the palate of this archbishop of procurers to a lecherous antiquity to hold up Prufrock as a New World type ... the nibbler at sophistication ... the not quite ... the United States! . . . No. The New World is Montezuma" (I 24). Counter to "Prufrock" and Eliot's nostalgic drift in general, in 1918 Williams can already see the new American poetry-the formal breakthroughs he and others achieved during the experimental 'teens in New York-falling before Eliot's Old World armada like Montezuma before Cortez, a new world of possibilities sacrificed for the moment to counterrevolutionary old world compunctions. Recently some British criticism has come to view Eliot in a similar light, Graham Martin terming "Eliot's successful reconstituting of the English poeuc tradidon ... the most ambidous feat of cultural imperialism the century seems likely to produce" (22). Lawrence had glanced obliquely at Montezuma in his 1915 lyric "New Heaven and Earth," in which he listed Cortez among a number of pioneer spirits, and through hyperbolic emuladon idenrified himself with the conquistador: My God, but I can only say I touch, I feel the unknown! I am the first comer! Cortes, Pisarro, Columbus, Cabot, they are nothing, nothing! I am the first comer! I am the discoverer! I have found the other world! (iComplete Poems, 259)^ But in the first versions of Lawrence's Studies in Classic American Literature, appearing in the English Review in eight consecudve installments from November, 1918, to June,</page><page sequence="4">1919, Lawrence went on to imagine the other world's perspective as well, Montezuma's point of view as a prophetic victim. In the November, 1918, issue Lawrence published the more spiritualistic but less flippant, less disillusioned first version of "The Spirit of Place," a more substantial piece than the version that begins the book-length Studies. For our purposes, though, the crucial difference between Lawrence's two versions is that his discussion of Montezuma is absent from the 1923 version. But in the 1918 version the encounter between Montezuma and Cortez is strikingly presented in terms of the relation between spiritual and historical forces. Essenually, as a divine king Montezuma was the spiritual center and so the "psychic geographic pole" of his culture: And so, when Cortes lands in Mexico, he finds the subde and patheuc Montezuma, the priest-emperor, who receives him with mystic sympathy, mysdc desire. In America a similar break in the circuit of vitalism, a similar shifting of the great mystic-magnetic polarity must have taken place, in the fifteenth century, as it took place in Europe. And as Europe fell under the spell of America, America fell under the spell of Europe. So Montezuma embraced the Spanish as the fulfilment of the legend of the white, bearded strangers, who should come as gods across the east.. .. The Aztecs. .. only expressed in their legend of the coming of the white stranger that which their innermost, sensitised souls knew beforehand as a fact. (325) Two years later Lawrence was still thinking about Montezuma, in terms that contrast his spiritual sensitivity with his unfulfilled, uncompleted destiny. In 1920 the New Republic ran Lawrence's "America, Listen to Your Own," which concluded: "Americans must take up life where the Red Indian, the Aztec, the Maya, the Incas left it off. ... A great and lovely life-form, unperfected, fell with Montezuma. . . . Montezuma had other emotions, such as we have not known or admitted. We must start from Montezuma" (90-91). And yet Montezuma entered Western history as a monumental victim. From this perspective the prophetic impulse appears as an intimation of being victimized. So the figure of Montezuma as a distinctly American principle combines sensitive vulnerability with reckless hospitality (cf. Sutton 2). It is certain that Williams knew of Lawrence's discussion of Montezuma, but probable too that he became aware of it after he had already located the figure in his own developing treatment of the American myth. I will offer some tangled and some straight textual evidence. The tangled evidence concerns what appears to be a mistaken dating on Williams' part, which when corrected places one of Lawrence's English Review pieces in Williams' hand by mid-1919. In "Four Foreigners" in The Little Review for September, 1919, Williams criticized some war poems by Aldington and Lawrence, declaring "Aldington has decidedly gone backwards in these poems. Lawrence fails because he has not lifted himself above his own excellences" (36). Later in the same article Williams referred explicitly to a poem by Aldington appearing "in the July English Review " (39); he then cited six lines from the poem "Reverie," which had actually appeared in that journal in May 1919 (372-74). Williams' misdating presumably derives from Williams'</page><page sequence="5">having also been discussing poems by Aldington and Lawrence that appeared in the July issue of Poetry. Why that is important is this: whereas the incorrectly cited July issue of the English Review contained no material by Aldington or Lawrence, the May, 1919, issue in which the cited Aldington poem had actually appeared also contained Lawrence's study of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Might Williams have slipped because of mixed feelings concerning Lawrence and the striking closeness of some of their concerns? Whatever the case, we know of Williams' longstanding interaction with London journals, and it is certain that he saw at least the May 1919 issue of the English Review. I believe the whole of Lawrence's first American studies were in Williams' keeping as they were coming out in New York; then he would have seen Lawrence's first "Spirit of Place" by the end of 1918. Therefore, the 1923 book publication of Lawrence's revised Studies would have come to Williams not as a seminal inspiration but as a useful reprise with variations of a work he had already attended to and absorbed. The straight evidence appears to confirm my argument: in "The Destruction of Tenochtitlan," Williams began with language similar enough to Lawrence's in the 1918 version of "The Spirit of Place" to be reckoned either an unwitting borrowing or, what I rather suspect, an intentional and intentionally covert gesture of connection. I will draw out two lines, the first from Lawrence, the second from Williams. Lawrence takes up the role of involuntary or "prophetic" inspiration in the individual artist on the model of Montezuma, then shifts to the effects of unconscious, collective motives on mass populations, in order to account for Europe's drive toward the New World: . .. We must wake and sharpen in ourselves the subtle faculty for perceiving the greater inhuman forces that control us.. . . We cannot see that great motions carry us and bring us to our place before we can even begin to know. We cannot see that invisible great winds carry us unwitting, as they carry the locust swarms, and direct us before our knowledge, as they direct the migrating birds. (322; my emphasis) The opening of Williams' "The Destruction of Tenochtitlan" echoes Lawrence's evocations of a buried creative self and a mass instinctual will. Williams' explanation for the violent pace and consequences of Europe's discovery and conquest of America is strictly metaphorical rather than indirectly metaphorical or mystical. In general Williams deflects Lawrence's discussion by translating Lawrence's spiritualisms-the spirit of place-into modes of instinct and human passion. This is a perfectly valid reduction of Lawrence's rhetoric, since Lawrence is working in terms of the equation (physical) passions = (spiritual) powers. But the gist of many of Williams' phrases is the same as Lawrence's, as is some of his diction: UPON THE ORCHIDEAN beauty of the new world the old rushed inevitably to revenge itself.. .. Such things occur in secret. Though men may be possessed by beauty while they work that is all they know of it or of their own terrible hands; they do not fathom the forces which carry them. Spain cannot be blamed for the crassness of</page><page sequence="6">the discoverers. They moved oat across the seas stirred by instincts, ancient beyond thought as the depths they were crossing, which they obeyed under the names of King or Christ or whatever it might be, while they watched the recreative New unfolding itself miraculously before them, before them, deafened and blinded. (AG 27; first emphasis mine) Putting Williams' Prologue to Kora in Hell next to Lawrence's 1918 "Spirit of Place," we saw that an interest in Montezuma developed independently but concurrently in both writers; both were concerned to recover and discuss values he was seen to represent. For Williams in particular Montezuma became a kind of anti-Eliotian slogan: when Williams began In the American Grain with a series of "first comers" to the New World, recounting especially Cortez's encounter with Montezuma, he countered Eliot's "lecherous antiquity" with a vision of an expansive historical coitus, the violent engendering of a new culture, and thereby answered the Lawrencean challenge to "start from Montezuma." Lawrence's treatment of Montezuma suggested ways of positioning the larger historical and the finer psychological issues evoked by the figure, and it suggested them very early on in Williams' historical project. Williams' and Lawrence's convergence at the scene of Montezuma's fall illuminates the way that the American colonial myth intersects with the personal myth of these artists, and the way that the colonial myth informs the mystique of the modernist artist-hero in general. Cortez and Montezuma as hero and victim are not only shared themes. They are shared self-conceits shaping the personae that populate Williams' and Lawrence's work, legendary frames for the creative artist both as active explorer and culture-hero and as passive prophetic victim. In these frames Williams' interest in Persephone figures, Lawrence's in Orphic figures, and their related fictional and autobiographical treatments of heroic artistic wandering converge: Birds, Beasts and Flowers, Mornings in Mexico and The Plumed Serpent; "The Wanderer," Kora in Hell," "Rome," and A Voyage to Pagany. Praising the narrator's rhetoric in "The Destruction of Tenochtitlan," Whitaker has remarked that of all the chapters in In the American Grain, this one "demands heroic treatment. It focuses the full destructive engagement of our double inheritance" (Williams 81). One of Odysseus's main epithets, of course, is "sacker of cities"; George Dimrock has explained that one way the epic hero establishes that identity is "to introduce the idea of trouble to those who, like the Phaeacians, are not sufficiently aware of it," as Cortez would do to the Aztecs (420). The pursuit of creation through destruction formulates the ambivalence and the violence of the hero. By treating Montezuma and Cortez, Williams and Lawrence are taking up the inescapable themes of colonial heroism. The channeling of cultural creativity into colonial expansion both distresses and fascinates modernist writers of the American myth, for implicitly it parallels that which is aggressive in the activities of the experimental, explorative artist-voyager who would also be a culture-hero. Williams and Lawrence began thinking about Montezuma in the midst of the Great War; in Europe Freud was writing Beyond the Pleasure Principle. The immediate connecting thread here is the idea of a death drive, and more generally the interpretation of "instincts" insofar as they are manifest as historical forces. Freud would remark later: "Instincts are mythical entities, magnificent in their indefiniteness" (84), but one way to</page><page sequence="7">think of Freud's Todestrieb is as his version of the spirits of the ancestors, the souls of the dead. We see another linking of drives and the dead in Yeats' phrase from Per Arnica Silentia Lunae, also written around 1917: "The dead living in their memories are, I am persuaded, the source of all that we call instinct, and it is their love and their desire, all unknowing, that make us drive beyond our reason" (359). In these speculative responses to the Great War and the destructions of the historical moment, the questions Williams and Lawrence, Yeats and Freud are asking are: what is the relation of the historical forces that destroy and create cultures to the ideals and passions of the individuals caught up in or giving shape to the actual events? In their various ways, and in stated and unstated dialogue with the psychoanalytical and Marxist interpretations, both Lawrence and Williams as poets of history were working out psychological or spiritual/instinctual explanations for the movements of historical forces: the "great motions" that "carry us," the unfathomable, ancient "forces." From this perspective the further language of the opening of Williams' "Destruction of Tenochtitlan" is especially striking. For his figures locate the source of Montezuma's fall in the force of Europe's own death drive: "It was the spirit of malice which underlies men's lives and against which nothing offers resistance. And bitter as the thought may be that Tenochtitlan, the barbaric city, its people, its genius wherever found should have been crushed out because of the awkward names men give their emptiness, yet it was no man's fault. It was the force of the pack whom the dead drive " (my emphasis; 27). The melancholy recognidon in this passage conveys Williams' appreciation of the irony of colonial history: the energies that found and renovate cultures are also destructive forces driven by historical frustrations. In psychoanalytical allegory, the colonial hero personifies an exteriorized death-drive. Montezuma confrondng the tide of Western history represents the New World as discovered, taken, violated, and betrayed. To Cortez the New World arose as a material on which to imprint his own desdny; so to the artist-hero the given world is ultimately material to be deformed, reformed through art. But when the poet submits to the actuality of historical record, he engages dimensions of the creative activity at which the artist must adopt the prophetic attitude, where one does not form but must be informed by the material in question. The poet of American history must identify with both sides of the colonial equation. Heroism-the desire to make history-prompts its counterpart, prophecy-the need to know and to declare the future. For both writers, Montezuma became an emblem for the pathos of revelation, the fatality of foreseeing one's own destruction. The archaic scene evoked by the poet of history is the ritual of heroic descent into the realm of the past, the dead and gone, where by an offering of blood he suffers a revelation of the future. As literally enacted in the first of Pound's Cantos, the poet historian is an Odysseus undertaking a descent in order to confront Tiresias, the figure of prophecy.^ In Paterson this descent comes to the surface in "The Library," Paterson's gateway to the realm of shadows: Dead men's dreams, confined by these walls, risen, seek an outlet Awake, he dozes in a fever heat, cheeks burning . . loaning blood to the past, amazed . risking life (P 100-101)</page><page sequence="8">Ideally the poet of history becomes a hero of descent capable of withstanding the "force of the pack whom the dead drive," who can dispel the tyrannies holding down the creative forces of the past (cf. Hahn on A Voyage to Pagany). The artist must steer between the clumsy destructiveness of Cortez's energy and the passive acquiescence of Montezuma's receptivity: the poet-historian's job is not to be Montezuma, but to "start from Montezuma," to rescue his significance from the "interlopers" upholding interpretations that admit only the conquerors' side of the story. In the following dialogue from Williams' chapter on Aaron Burr, "The Virtue of History," by identifying with Burr Williams sets his own heroic persona in opposition to the voice of traditional reason. First the poet of history: But how small is the sum of good writing against the mass of poisonous stuff that Finds its way into the history books; for the dead can be stifled like the living. That's metaphysical. Never. That of the dead which exists in our imaginations has as much fact as have we ourselves. The premise that serves to fix us fixes also that part of them which we remember. (AG 189) Williams as poet-historian offers a succinct depth psychology of history, by affirming that without the acts of mind that give marginalized historical knowledge emotional validity, capable identity in the present is not possible. What is most important about the past is neither the mere fact of it nor the authorized version of it but the enduring presence in it of creative forces that were vanquished, withheld, or unacknowledged, but which are still recoverable. Such recovery is what "prophecy" is all about: those prophecies Williams composed by descending into the American underclass and the American archives, Lawrence by crossing into lower Mexico, and ultimately by crawling into Etruscan burial mounds. In awkward, strong, subtly vatic phrases, Williams goes on, since history "lives in us practically day by day we should fear it. But if it is, as it may be, a tyranny over the souls of the dead-and so the imaginations of the living-where lies our greatest well of inspiration, our greatest hope of freedom (since the future is totally blank, if not black) we should guard it doubly from the interlopers" (AG 189). Williams is careful to undercut the anthropomorphic tonality of "souls of the dead," by denying the possibility of actual prophetic knowledge: "the future is totally blank." But in fact Williams has only displaced the rhetoric of prophecy to the colonial explorers who discovered "the recreative New unfolding itself miraculously." This phrase is literally a definition of prophecy: the conquest of the New World is a figure for a state of continual revelation. Compare Lawrence's rhetoric depicting the Aztec counterpart of this revelation--the premonition of the western strangers-in the 1918 "Spirit of Place": "Montezuma, a priest, a decadent and sensitive character, was filled with mystic apprehension ... the rarest impressions upon the physical soul, from the invisible ether, could pass on occasionally into uninterrupted consciousness" (325-26). Yet the Aztec legend of the coming gods could be fulfilled only with the departure of the souls of the ancestors. In The Labyrinth of Solitude: Life and Thought in Mexico, Octavio Paz discusses the astounding disaster of the "complete and refined" Aztec civilization: "Why did Montezuma give up? Why was he so fascinated by the Spaniards that he experienced a</page><page sequence="9">vertigo which it is no exaggeration to call sacred-the lucid vertigo of the suicide on the brink of the abyss? The gods had abandoned him ... The celestial omens [were] adverse, and the people [felt] the attraction of death" (93; see Weiland). Montezuma's collapse appears to be a particularly vivid historical example of the death drive overtaking an entire culture. The traditional signs of the divine became vacant (it is said) at the same time that another culture launched an unprecedented power-drive. Montezuma's prophecies were in fact premonitions of cultural destruction, the Aztec apocalypse, signified by the departure of the aboriginal ancestors in favor of the "gods from the East." As the seer of the coming of the conquistadors, Montezuma is the historian of his own downfall. The story of Montezuma suggests that in some way aboriginal, pre-colonial America had prepared for its own victimization. The danger built into Montezuma's prophetic attitude may have been that his native autocracy promoted an openness or receptivity so sublimely indiscriminate that the reality of the threat Cortez presented was utterly obscured by the affirmation conveyed by the fulfillment of the legend. Describing the culture of Tenochtitlan, Williams emphasized this magnificent na√Øv√©t√© and conveyed a sense of the New World's uninnoculated vulnerability: "Streets, public squares, markets, temples, palaces, the city spread its dark life upon the earth of a new world, rooted there, sensitive to its richest beauty, but so completely removed from those foreign contacts which harden and protect, that at the very breath of conquest it vanished" (AG 32). So Cortez has the distinction of being the heroic deconstructor of an entire civilization: Montezuma's exquisite theocracy was pivoted so narrowly upon himself that by eliminating him Cortez was able to unravel a whole culture with one blow. The parable of Montezuma's fall presents in symbolic relief Williams' recurrent vision of America's flagrant but inarticulate rapacity, its roots in victimization. Williams' poignant treatment of Elsie, the perennial American innocent offering herself to brutal rapes, echoes both the fall of Montezuma in particular and the spiritual seduction and physical elimination of the Indian populations ("tricked out . . . with gauds") in general: . . . young slatterns, bathed in filth from Monday to Saturday to be tricked out that night with gauds from imaginations which have no peasant traditions to give them character but flutter and flaunt sheer rags-succumbing without emotion save numbed terror under some hedge of choke-cherry or viburnum which they cannot express- (I 131-32)</page><page sequence="10">In Montezuma's fall two prophecies collided in catastrophe, the depraved purity of the Aztec state and the manifest destinies of the Western world. What prophecy always foretells is that aggression will be born in the exteriorization of the death drive, to which the sensitive will always be vulnerable. Williams suggests that America has more creative channels into which to pour its aggressions and sensitivities than literal conquests, literal self-destructions. Lawrence also voiced a cautionary note concerning the puritanical aftermath of colonial heroics at the end of the 1918 "Spirit of Place": "every enthusiasm, every passion, has a dual motion: first a motion of liberation, of setting free; and secondly a motion of vindictive repression of the living impulse" (327). But Lawrence also left there a trace of "living impulse," a positive prophecy, or at least the eloquent expression of a vast cultural desire, that would have moved Williams, I think, for essentially Lawrence predicted the Williams who perfected one great articulation of the American locality: There will come an America which we cannot foretell, a new creation on the face of the earth, a world beyond us ... . For every great locality has it own pure daimon, and is conveyed at last into perfected life.. . . Every great locality expresses itself perfectly, in its flowers, its own birds and beasts, lastly its own men, with their perfected works.. .. (330-31) Notes 1. In fact his material appeared there several more times. I discuss Williams' relation to the Egoist in "Dora Marsden's Egoism." 2. That American verse needed saving is implied by John Gould Fletcher, who began his review of Williams' Al Que Quiere! in the Egoist for April 1918: "One writes about most American poets more from a sense of duty than from a feeling of abiding pleasure in their productions. . . (60). 3. See Peterfreund and Hahn. Keats, "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer:" . . . Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He star'd at the Pacific-and all his men Look'd at each other with a wild surmise Silent, upon a peak in Darien. 4. I discuss this poem's relation to Williams' "The Wanderer," and further topics of the Williams/Lawrence connection, in "The Melancholy Serpent: Body and Landscape in William Carlos Williams and D. H. Lawrence," forthcoming in the Bucknell Review.</page><page sequence="11">11 5. Here again Whitaker broke the ground: discussing A Voyage to Pagany, he has remarked: "the psychological pattern most significantly recalls D. H. Lawrence. Like the protagonists of Kangaroo, St. Mawr, or The Plumed Serpent, [Williams' persona] Evans descends from the rigidities of an established life and a home culture to traverse a shadowily populated and historically potent landscape. . . . Indeed, A Voyage to Pagany is yet closer to Lawrence's own travel books-especially Twilight in Italy and Mornings in Mexico- which dramatize similar psychological descents" (Williams 92; see also "Lawrence's Western Path"). 6. Ezra Pound, The Cantos: . . . Poured ointment, cried to the gods, To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine; Unsheathed the narrow sword, 1 sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead Till I should hear Tiresias.
