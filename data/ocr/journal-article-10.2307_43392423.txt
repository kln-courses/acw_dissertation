<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGERY IN THE PROSE WORKS OF ROBERTO ARLT J. M. Flint* The study of imagery in Arlt's prose is a task which none of his critics has yet attempted although its function is consubstantial with one of the overall aims of his writing in suggesting the atmosphere of the city and capturing the interpénétration of man and his urban environment. There are moments in Arlt's four novels, El juguete rabioso (1926), Los siete locos (1929), Los lanzallamas (1931), and El amor brujo (1932), when the life of the city overrides the exist- ence of the individual, infusing it with its own tensions and distor- tions, and alternatively, when the anguish of the individual is cast against the urban background, moulding the city into grotesque shapes and expressionistic colours. In certain incidents the focus of Arlt's writing moves from one to the other as the background of fantasmagorical shapes and geometric forms is sharpened or blurred; this is especially so in those sequences where fantasy takes over from reality. To maintain the level of tension which he sought in his novels and to suggest to his reader the despair that grips his major charac- ters, Arlt had to have recourse to some instrument which would carry his reader beyond description and evoke an emotive response. The only artifice adapted to this kind of suggestion was the image, whether as metaphor or simile; with Arlt, the latter predominates. A detailed analysis of one sequence will make this clear. In Los siete locos, the first onslaught of anguish occurs when the protagonist Erdosain is deserted by his wife in favour of her lover, the Captain (I, 197 ff.).1 After the disclosure of Elsa's infidelity, Erdosain discusses his own emotions with the Captain. "... los hom- bres están tan tristes que tienen necesidad de ser humillados por alguien", he cries in quasi-Dostoievskian vein. After a masochistic discussion with Elsa and her lover, in which he surveys the origins of his desire for humiliation at the hands of some other person, the * Jack M. Flint: *1928. M. A., Ph.

"Lo aturdía la pena como un gran día de sol en el tròpico. Se le caían los párpados", writes Arit, in an image inverting the normal splendours of sunlight. "El sentido de las palabras se hundía en su entendimiento con la lentitud de una piedra en un agua dema- siado espesa" (I, 206). Continuing and reinforcing the images, a fantasy is introduced in which Erdosain envisages his wife against a sterile urban landscape (she is in fact by his side): "en los tumultos monstruosos de las ciudades de portland y de hierro, cruzando diago- nales oscuras a la oblicua sombra de los rascacielos, bajo una amena- zadora red de negros cables de alta tensión" (I, 206). He is then abandoned by Elsa and his anguish erupts into its full, demented violence. Time ceases to exist for him and mere moments are stretch- ed out endlessly.2 He would hurl himself into a well had he the strength; "borbotones de desesperación" gather in his throat. And yet, we are merely on the threshold of the welter of images to come. His eyes are more sensitive to darkness than a wound is to salt, inverting once again the normal associations of light. After two fur- ther paragraphs, the image of the wound is reactivated, as Erdosain loses grip of his own identity. "Sentía que no era ya un hombre, sino una llaga cubierta de piel, que se pasmaba y gritaba a cada latido de sus venas" (I, 208). As his individuality is eroded by the power of his anguish he becomes a monster "... enroscado en sí mismo en el negro vientre de la pieza". (Animal imagery is not uncommon in Arlt, although, as we shall see, it is less frequent than mechanical and technological analogies.) In a series of interlocking images, Erdosain now runs the gamut of his complex emotions; perhaps suggested by the concept of the room as "un vientre", "cada capa de oscuridad que descendía de sus párpados era un tejido placentario que lo aisla- ba del universo de los hombres". The analogy with water is once more exploited as cataracts of darkness fall upon the room and, finally, darkness and water merge in one of Arlt's frequent undersea images as he lies "enroscado y palpitante como un caracol en una profundidad oceánica" (I, 209). Doubting his very existence, he fails to recognise the flesh of his own forehead. The water analogies now mingle with other concepts. His soul is compared to a sword-edge and a technical image appears for the first time as his "... conciencia de ser ... no ocupaba más de un centímetro cuadrado de sensibili- dad." Just as he had imagined Elsa trapped in a hostile urban land- scape, he now finds himself "en el fondo de un cubo de portland", a 2 Emerson says: "Time is, indeed, the theatre and seat of illusion: nothing is so ductile and elastic. The mind stretches an hour to a century, and dwarfs an age to an hour" (1922: 148, "Old Age").</page><page sequence="3">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 255 fantasy which expands until he seizes upon a vision of his wife in sexual relations with her lover, whereupon an animal comparison is invoked to suggest his abasement: "¿No quedaban así los sapos que sobre la huella trincaba la rueda de la carreta, aplastados y ardien- tes? " (I, 210). In his humiliation, he begs for further suffering; but suddenly the tension is released as his life slips silently away from him like water from a lake after the breaching of a dyke. The focus then shifts to a psychosomatic consequence of his anguish, his heart- beat. In a Bosch-like vision, his heart opens and closes like an eye, which nevertheless sees. In this abject state, he recalls himself as a child watching a river; significantly, he speaks of "el desaparecer continuo de un río" and sees himself as "una cascada de carne en las oscuridades". The heart/eye image is finally repeated as he emerges from his trauma to faint recognition of surrounding reality and, as the yellow light filters under the door, the tension is dissipated. This sequence has been examined at some length to show how a series of some twenty or more images carries the reader through Erdosain's experience of anguish, suspending all sense of time and creating spirals of emotion, as one image is interlocked with another. Arlt seems to have grasped, from Los siete locos onwards, that no other device could suggest the state of near madness of his protago- nist. Thus, the emotional register of his novels relies greatly on the ability of the image to evoke an intuitive response in the reader and involve him in an ongoing process. Whilst it is revealing to explore a series of concatenated images in this way, it will not adequately lay bare the constants of Arlt's technique. We shall therefore classify his images in a more categorical fashion. He cannot be accused of practising l'artisanat du style and any divisions are best based firstly on their function within the work and secondly on their content, on the assumption that an author whose enquiry is into the mind of criminals, social deviants, the obsessed and the anguished, is likely to reveal meaningful tendencies in the matters he deems worthy of metaphorisation. We shall there- fore approach his imagery from two points of view : (a) the matter chosen for analogy (the "tenor") and (b) the analogy offered ("the vehicle").3 We shall not maintain any distinction between metaphor and simile although general reference will be made to Arlt's predilec- tions, based on certain constant features. It is also proposed to sepa- rate the early El juguete rabioso from the main body of the novels and from the stories published in El jorobadito. Critics are generally agreed that El juguete rabioso is highly auto- biographical; it was originally to be called La vida puerca, perhaps in 3 These are I. A. Richard's terms. They are simple and avoid jargon.</page><page sequence="4">256 J. M. Flint itself a measure of its youthful rebellion.4 Arlt maintains that it was written in various stages, the last chapter being completed "... a mediados de 1924, cuando una editorial organizó un concurso. El primer capítulo en 1919. El autor no sabía entonces cuál iba a ser su camino efectivo en la vida." Written between his nineteenth and twentyfifth year, it was unlikely to show the same expertise in its imagery as the later works. However, it contains some of the best descriptive prose that Arlt was ever to write. It remains apart from his other prose works in its aggressive realism whereas his mature writing becomes increasingly expressionistic. This has an immediate effect on the use of imagery, since Arlt appears not yet to have discerned the major themes which were to obsess him in his later works. As we have suggested, imagery is used in the latter in pursuit of a specific end, the evocation of anguish, whereas the theme of anguish appears only fragmentarily in his first novel. It seems unlike- ly that Arlt grasped at this early stage that the image was likely to be his most telling instrument. Thus, analogies are few in El juguete rabioso, other than the standard dead metaphors of everyday Span- ish. Where they are used, they are often forced into his writing for graphic effect, as in: "Su memoria (El Rengo, who looks after horses) era un almanaque de Gotha de la nobleza bestial" (I, 135). Simple metaphors serve immediate descriptive purposes, often rely- ing on animal analogies, such as "su perfil de gavilán" or "un obeso salchichero con cara de vaca". There is a series of uncomplicated similes, often establishing a concrete relationship as in "labios delga- dos como dos tablitas" or "el rostro pálido y los ojos fríos como láminas de acero". Sometimes the imagery is quite unimaginative, as when lips tremble like leaves or hair moves on a character's forehead as if the wind had passed by. The insistence on simile at the expense of metaphor (a problem which was to persist throughout Arlt's writ- ing career) forces him into mitigating the repetitive effect of the como with heavy-handed substitutes like a semejanza de or semejante a, a problem which is solved in the later works by incorporating the como into the alliterative structure of the sentence, thus providing greater euphony. Only rarely is there a preference for the verbal form of como si, which is understandable if we bear in mind the overriding adjectival style of this first novel. Curiously, when he has recourse to a verbal simile it foreshadows the tone of Los siete locos, as though the shift from adjectival description to verbal movement had carried 4 Noé Jitrik maintains that "Este título 'epatante' y tremendista ... insinúa lo que Ailt se propuso, que es lo mismo que logró. Buenos Aires aparece con un empañado esplendor, bufando como un animal de exterminio, lanzado sobre la pobre gente que quiere vivir y no sabe como hacerlo, especie de dejados de la mano de Dios." (1967: 90).</page><page sequence="5">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 257 him forward into a more anguished view of reality. "Los labios de la mujer se torcieron convulsivamente, como si masticara un odio pega- joso, terrible" (I, 79). This adumbrates the technique of the mature works, the concrete verb (masticar) being made to react on an ab- straction ( odio pegajoso, terrible). Such compelling images will later be indispensable to the creation of the emotional register of Los siete locos; here they are few indeed. Yet certain seeds are planted in El juguete rabioso which come to fruition in subsequent works. There emerge a number of technical images deriving from Arlt's penchant for the sciences, with the flat planes, geometric shapes and pieces of machinery which were to develop into a constant in the anguished sequences to come. How- ever, the use of imagery in this early work is as yet sporadic, incon- stant and generally unenterprising. One or two more daring analogies, typical of Los siete locos, begin to appear, usually associated with human emotions, as in "un sollozo pesado de salitre" or "Cuando hablaba de cosas sucias, su cara resplandecía como si la hubieran cardado de tocino". Generally, however, the images in El juguete rabioso rely more on the adjectival component of the tenor than on the originality of the vehicle, as in "la abuela encorvada, sorda y negruzca como un árbol tostado por el fuego" (I, 40), where the collocation of the three epithets lends force and colour to the figure of the old woman rather than the trite simile. Turning to the three major works, it is possible to identify certain patterns and to classify the tenor of the imagery according to catego- ries suggested by their frequency. In descending order of frequency, these are: (i) human emotions (ii) physical description of persons (iii) human movement (iv) natural phenomena and (v) man-made physical surroundings. These will serve as guidelines and points of reference only. More revealing is to view these categories through the vehicle itself. It is also possible to draw conclusions about Arlt's choice in this respect and to establish parallels with the general ideol- ogy that invests his prose works. The overwhelming burden of topics chosen for analogy in the novels and short-stories relates to human emotions and sensations. In Los siete locos and Los lanzallamas the list is consistent: fear, an- guish, grief, rancour, pain, despair, bewilderment, desire, the barren- ness of life, hatred, alienation, human silence, lassitude, etc. In El amor brujo, where the emphasis shifts from the expressionistic suggestion of anguish and loneliness to a more satirical attack on bourgeois society, interlarded with the problem of human doubt, there is a concomitant shift in the topics chosen for analogy: joy, nostalgia, interest in the opposite sex, and, as Balder's insecurity vis-à-vis Irene begins to bite, loathing and doubt. However, it is more</page><page sequence="6">258 J. M. Flint revealing to trace the pattern of development in the vehicle chosen to analogize these human emotions and sensations. Not surprisingly, Arlt resorts to animal imagery but not nearly so often nor so effec- tively as to technological concepts, comparisons with natural phe- nomena or inert objects. Less frequently, human analogies are used, whether through direct comparison with the body, or through dis- ease, which seemed to haunt him.5 It seems improbable that human emotions might be analogized through concepts taken from science, technology and instruments of human design, but it is to this sphere that Arlt most readily turns. "Erdosain siente que las espirales de su odio almacenan flexibilidad y potencia. Este odio es como el resorte de un tensor" (II, 57). "Erdo- sain se siente cogido por un engranaje apocalíptico" (II, 158). "Un terror gritante le anuda los nervios, trombas de aire escapan de su laringe seca como el crisol de un horno ..." (II, 252). Technical imagery gains momentum as his writing advances, the above exam- ples being from Los lanzallamas. However, in Los siete locos, such imagery is not uncommon. "El tenía la sensación que todas las mues- cas de su alma sangraban como bajo la mecha de un torno" (I, 166) from engineering technology. Irene makes her sexual appeal to Balder through her "ondas cortas"; he, in his turn, is suffocated in "un alto horno de voluptuosidad". Arlt is competent in his technical imagery so long as it is tied to human emotions, since by definition, the technical image is non-human and therefore capable of suggesting the ineluctability of the sensations which he seeks to explore. Pre- sumably, the fact that he aims to incorporate the city into the novel as an omnipresent force also implies a heavy reliance on man-made objects and devices. More importantly, he began writing at a time when modern art was possibly at its most angular, in the aftermath of Cubism.6 This is acutely reflected both in his geometric vocabu- lary and in his choice of imagery. Unfortunately, when he chooses to exaggerate, he falls into some ugly excesses, as in the following pas- sage from "Escritor fracasado": "Mi sensibilidad exasperada por el fracaso sintonizaba las fallas del arte con una aguda hiperestesia de radiogoniómetro. Allí donde los otros veían una curva yo localizaba el vértice de un ángulo" (III, 235). It may be argued that the charac- ter under creation in this short story is a priggish, uncreative writer and that the image is adapted to the personage but it does not excuse the verbiage. 5 In one of his Aguafuertes porteños he confesses: "No sé por qué se me ocurre que voy a morir de un cáncer al estómago." He actually died of a heart attack at 42 years of age. Cancer figures in his imagery, however. 6 I have referred elsewhere (1979: 171) to this aspect of Arlt's writing.</page><page sequence="7">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 259 A curious image is that of people pierced through the head by an arrow, as with Hipólita, the prostitute. "Una sensación de frío roza el oído de Hipólita como saeta de oro. Le taladra los sesos" (II, 94). This was published in 1931. In 1935, the image is still alive in the Moroccan stories, El criador de gorilas, where we find: "Rahutia, la bailarina, había corrido a través de las decepciones con el mismo gesto doloroso de un guerrero que tiene las sienes atravesadas por una saeta" (II, 284). Erdosain, too, meets a similar fate; he is like a man "que tuviera las sienes horadadas por una saeta" (II, 36). This tend- ency towards obsessive imagery was a fault that Arlt had difficulty in controlling. Leaving human emotions aside, movement and appearance are also analogized by technical reference. When Barsut strikes Erdosain, the blow is compared to a hydraulic press. Ester Primavera is widely travelled and, the detail from her journeys that Arlt chooses to perpetuate is that she has seen "rostros que parecían haber pasado por los cilindros de una laminadora y cráneos truncos en obtusas, como si los hubiera trepanado una fresa" (III, 250). Similarly, the body of the old man in "Halid Majid el achicharrado" looks as though it has passed through "un engranaje terrible que sin hacerle perder su forma humana le hubiese desgarrado con sus dientes" (II, 275). Natural phenomena, too, may be compared to technical paraphernalia, as in "nubes dentadas como engranajes". The same analogy is extended, although now with a rare auditory effect, to animals: "La lluvia hacía funcionar en las acequias el breve engranaje de las ranas' (I, 350). Also of importance in the suggestion of human emotions are those images taken from natural phenomena. Arlt was "a man of the pave- ment", to use Hudson's apt phrase and as such, imagery having na- ture and natural phenomena at its core is most often seen through the lens of the urban landscape. It is not possible to conclude, how- ever, that when he steps outside the urban atmosphere he is necessar- ily less successful. Thus, quite early in Los siete locos, we find Erdo- sain dwelling on the lack of success in his life; he is "embotado de angustia" and his grief seeks an outlet in the brothels. "Entonces supo el terror del fraudulento, el terror luminoso que es como el estallido de un gran día de sol en la convexidad de una salitrera" (I, 166). This simile will bear closer analysis as it reveals certain tendencies in Arlťs technique. Firstly, he is using an Expressionist method by inverting the normal qualities associated with light, so that the sensation of luminosity inherent in human joy is transposed into dark terror. Secondly, the image is synaesthetic, not only in- voking the dehydrating effects of the sun on the nitrate but relying also on the bitter taste. It is the latter which prevails, underlying the</page><page sequence="8">260 J. M. Flint false associations of the brothel, with its fraudulent sex. Finally, the image is geometric ("convexidad")- A similar notion of barrennes is achieved when Erdosain thinks of Hipólita about to marry the brut- ish Ergueta. His idealised picture of the self-sacrificing prostitute is reduced to the fragility of a plant, whilst Ergueta's coarseness is seen as a stony wilderness. The whole effect is enhanced by including the simile within a fantasy in which Hipólita is imagined under menacing clouds and a horrifying yellow sun (once again the inversion of light and dark). "Erdosain estaba asombrado frente a tanta grosería. Pensó en la deliciosa criatura y se la imaginó soportando a ese bruto bajo un cielo oscurecido por grandes nubes de polvo e incendiado por un sol amarillo y espantoso. Ella se marchitaría como un helecho transplan- tado a un pedregal" (1,317). Similarly, the sterility of her life is "como un arenal geográficamente explorado". Balder is "un hombre perdido en su propio desierto", whilst the failed writer in "Escritor fracasado" suffers "una congoja de viajero perdido en el desierto". Elsewhere we find "desierto del alma humana, liso y gris". Some- times it may be an exotic wind like the Simoun which suggests the dark forces at work within Erdosain's personality (in spite of the fact that Arlt had not yet been to Africa) or anguish and illwill "que se endurecían en su pecho como el fango bajo el sol" (I, 366). So, too, after Elsa has been abandoned by her lover, life rushes over her, engulfing her "más violenta que un aluvión de fango". The malevolent effect of the sun deserves special enquiry, for it is a constant in Arlt's imagery. Erdosain is obliged to "parapetearse contra el sol invisible que arroja en su espíritu oleadas de luz" (II, 54); "el sol invisible rueda cataratas de luz ante sus ojos" (II, 53) or again, "el sol, que para los otros era sol de fiesta, lucía para nosotros en lo alto, fúlgido y siniestro" (II, 112). These are deliber- ate attempts to subvert accepted values of light and dark as in the "terror luminoso" quoted above. If we accept the hypothesis that Arlt is making a consistent attempt, in the Expressionist manner, to force emotions to the surface of his writing and to subvert existing notions of colour and luminosity, it is easy to understand why Erdo- sain's desperation "no tiene puestas de sol" (II, 55). A rarity in Arlt's writing is the use of flower imagery although he does not disdain to use Proust's terminology in one of his Aguafuer- tes, "Las muchachas en fior". A rare floral analogy in El amor brujo is unspecific and has funereal overtones, as the ghost of Irene lingers on in Balder's memory "semejante al débilísimo perfume de ciertas flores muertas". Of all natural phenomena, it is the eddy and flow of water which are a constant in the suggestion of emotion. Water first enters Los siete locos in a rather weak image evoking the swirling currents of Erdosain's thoughts (I, 217); thereafter it recurs frequent-</page><page sequence="9">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 26 1 ly. "Mas su angustia se hacía a cada instante más pesada, como si fuera una masa de agua, fatigando con su marea la verticalidad de sus miembros" (I, 363). Similarly, "el espacio entró en él como el océa- no en una esponja" (I, 362). Sometimes, the ocean depths represent impenetrability, as in Erdosain's annotation in his diary: "No sé si existo o no - escribió en su libreta. Sé que vivo sumergido en el fondo de una desesperación que no tiene puestas de sol y es como si me encontrara bajo una bóveda, sobre la cual se apoya el océano" (II, 55). More commonly, the ocean affords a refuge from the tem- pestuous life above: "... han pasado tantos cientos de días, que ahora me parece vivir en una ciudad profundísima, abajo, sobre el nivel del mar" (III, 277) (an image which seems to be expressed in contradic- tory terms). In a similar way Erdosain's silence towards his wife is "como el agua que en el fondo del océano debe tener la consistencia delacero" (II, llO).7 Less frequently, emotions are expressed through a comparable human sensation, sometimes in relation to bodily pain or disease. Loneliness is particularly susceptible to this treatment by which it becomes a loathesome disease like leprosy. "Erdosain es más triste que un leproso" and Hipólita "como una leprosa, se sentía aislada en su felicidad". For Emilio Espila, stricken with poverty and forced to live with his deaf brother in a ruined shack (reminiscent of situations that the dramatists of the Absurd were to exploit much later), "el dolor de vivir deyectaba en él círculos de sufrimiento, como una glándula enferma" (II, 147). Elsewhere, there are allusions to the "cónica mordedura de un chancro", "esa profunda úlcera de mi des- precio", "un dolor que es como desazón de un nervio en un diente podrido", "ese rencor subterráneo se extendía en él como un cán- cer", or, more dynamically, "un terror blando, como el concéntrico dolor que dilata los testículos cuando han sido golpeados". So, too, 7 The similarity between Arlťs undersea images and those used by Alfonsina Storni in her poem "Yo en el fondo del mar" is quite striking. "Ah! poder dormir en el fondo del mar, en una pieza de plomo con vidrios gruesos", writes Arit (I, 169). "En el fondo del mar/hay una casa de cristal", says Alfonsina. Surprisingly, Barsut is troubled by a dream in which a one-eyed fish winks at him. So, too, in Storni we find: "Un pulpo / me hace guiños / a través del cristal" (1965: 169). Alfonsina's poem was published in 1934, five year's after Arlt's work. Arlt actually re-uses this image in one of the Agua- fuertes, "El demonio del insomnio". "Quisiera dormir; dormir una eternidad en el fondo del mar, en una piececita de plomo, con ventanillas que le permi- tieran ver, cuando se despertara, de vez en cuando, el paso de los tiburones tuertos" (Arlt 1960: 320). In Los siete locos we also find: "... y sintió que se hundía, cataclismos sucesivos desgajaron los continentes, pero él hacía muchos siglos que dormía en un cuartujo de plomo en el fondo del mar" (I, 239). Alfonsina Storni committed suicide by drowning at Mar del Plata. It may be assumed that she was familiar with Arlt's writing.</page><page sequence="10">262 J. M. Flint Erdosain feels broken and lonely "como si le hubieran roto la colum- na vertebral de un puntapié" (II, 163). The foetal position is referred to more than once suggesting a certain Freudian awareness in Arlt, whilst the placenta is invoked several times in his images, now as refuge for the victim of some pain (Freudian regression? ), now as "esa placenta invisible que ahogaba mi cerebro". Animal imagery is a common recourse for all writers. It is readily assimilated by the reader, on whose anthropomorphic imagination the author can rely. Thus, the recurrence of a generalised simile in Arlt, based on the term "fiera". Erdosain paces out his own existence "igual que las fieras enjauladas"; the victims of tuberculosis lie in the mountain sanatorium, "Como las fieras del bosque, nosotros olfatea- mos a Buenos Aires". Similarly, the sub-human species of thieves, macrós, 8 gamblers and the like, described in El jorobadito, go under the generic of "Las fieras". Generally speaking, Arlt's animal imagery is uninspired when seeking analogies for human experience: "el deseo zumbaba como un tábano en su oído", "un hombre enorme con cara de buey"; "rateros y 'batidores' con perfil de tigre". Sometimes it is even erroneous, as with the "boa erecta en salto de ataque" or the rhinoceros in a pool blowing water. Thirst is "una culebra de fuego"; a character is hungry as "un tigre en ayunas" (an unoriginal popular- ism). Arlt was incapable of imposing order on his animal imagery and this sometimes leads him into extended similes which detract from the effect he is seeking. Thus: "pensaba que cada pesar era un buho que saltaba de una rama a otra de su desdicha" (I, 177). So, too, the following, where over-extension leads to grave stylistic problems. "Como un cerdo hociquea la palizada de su pocilga para escapar del matadero ... golpea mentalmente cada leño de la empalizada espan- tosa del mundo, que aunque tiene leguas de circunferencia es más estrecha que el chiquero bestial" (II, 202). Fortunately, this tend- ency is rare. He fails to grasp the obvious truth that an animal analo- gy is unlikely to be successful in an abstract/concrete comparison; that is, whilst it is in the genius of all languages to describe human appearance by reference to animals, it is not easy to do so for human emotions, whence his relative success with technological imagery and his failure with animal analogies. If, on the other hand, we turn to his handling of human appear- ance, we see a different picture. Humour is given full rein and the acute eye of Arlt the journalist comes into focus. Rigoletto, the hunchback in "El jorobadito", is described in the following terms: "Pero, lo que causaba en él un efecto extraño además de la corcova 8 Macrò: 'lunfardo' (Buenos Aires) slang for a pimp or procurer, from French argot, maquereau, with the same meaning.</page><page sequence="11">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 263 consabida, era la cabeza cuadrada y la cara larga y redonda, de modo que por el cráneo parecía un mulo y por el semblante un caballo" (III, 207). Not all Arlt's animal imagery is as picturesque, but it is usually forceful and humourous, as in "cara de buey, ojos verdes, nariz de trompeta y apretadísimos labios". Sometimes, his analogies are deliberately offensive, but effective withall, as in the human/ animal comparison of the priest who baptises the progeny of a bour- geois marriage: "un sacerdote granuja, cara de culo y ojos de verraco, bautizaba la criatura" (III, 62), an image through which shines Arlt's virulent hatred of the lower middle-class from which he himself sprang. We must dwell briefly on one final area to which Arlt devotes considerable attention: that of external surroundings, whether man- made or natural phenomena. We have seen how the latter are used to analogize certain states of mind, but they in their turn are also com- pared, thus accentuating the atmosphere in which the characters are seen to move. Curiously, this produces an inbred situation, since, in order to find a vehicle for natural phenomena, Arlt turns most read- ily to other such phenomena. So we find "una atmósfera roja y fresca como un caudal de agua" (I, 180) - (an image repeated at I, 26) - or "Toca la oscuridad de la noche alta sobre la ciudad como un océano sobre un mundo submergido" (II, 152). It may be seen from these examples that he is using natural surroundings as an extension of his characters' moods. In the same way, Ergueta in the paroxysm of his religious fervour "contempla una estrella, gruesa, en la altura, como un nardo de oro" (II, 228), where it is clear that the star takes its dimensions not from reality but from Ergueta's religious transport, the rare floral image being chosen accordingly. As to man- made surroundings, it is surprising that Arlt, as a denizen of the city, is less interested than might be supposed in culling his analogies in this area. As happens with comparisons for natural phenomena, here too he turns towards a cognate area for his similes, so that a lift may be "sucio como una cocina", reflecting his debased view of the home. Similarly, "la escalera descendía más sucia que un muladar". In one instance, roofs blackened by tar are likened to lids of enor- mous coffins. Tied into this particular analogy is a complicated colour sequence, moulded into geometric shapes, the whole passage being designed to project the background of the city momentarily into the lives of Erdosain and the Astrólogo as they walk along by the Dock Sur in Buenos Aires. Here we see Arlt's processes at work in their entirety as the incipient monòlogo interior, similes, colours, disturbed word-order and geometric forms are brought together:</page><page sequence="12">264 J.

The imagery suggesting urban surroundings is much less happy in the later stages of Los lanzallamas and in El amor brujo. In the latter, Arlt never came to dominate and control the theme as he did in his earlier work and at the level of verbal creativity this has a deleterious effect. Images are too much sought after and lack the spontaneity of his previous writing. They are often acrobatic and there is an ugly tendency towards over-extension which jars on the reader's sensi- bilities and is no doubt a major factor in the erosion of the stylistic tone of the work. We see it in action in the following example: "Estanislao [Balder] cierra las ventanas. Los contramarcos metálicos reticulan el cielo de agrios mosaicos azules y la rugosa mica de los cristales los traslada a la profundidad de un acuario" (III, 65). The stylistic failure of this novel is probably due to this weakness rather than to any lexical breakdown. The theme of the love-affair between the older married man and the schoolgirl was a taboo which Arlt chose deliberately but it required delicate handling (as Nabokov was later to show) and the breakdown of the imagery leaves a major hollow in the work. The tenuous nature of the emotions and sensations that Arlt sets out to evoke thus make the image an imperative component of his writing. Whilst some of his analogies are somewhat acrobatic, he normally avoids the pitfall of over-indulgence. The imagery is clear and serves a functional purpose and virtuosity is kept to a minimum. He seemed not to possess a ready sense of metaphor and almost the whole weight of his analogies is borne by simile. Since analogy is so fundamental to the creation of the anguished tone of the major novels, it happens that when the demand for imagery is less intense, as, for example, when the conspirators assemble at the Astrólogo's house, the emotive level of the prose seems to plummet; the reader experiences a strange lack and is no longer urged along by the same waves of sensation. This seems to be largely due to technical changes imposed by the scarcity of imagery. At its best, Arlt's style is deeply emotive, demanding sympathetic penetration from the reader. The image alone was capable of achieving such effects.</page><page sequence="13">Imagery in the Prose Works of Roberto Arlt 265 RESUMEN El artículo examina la función de las imágenes (metáfora o símil) en la novelística de Roberto Arlt (Argentina, 1900 - 1942), empezan- do con su primera obra El juguete rabioso (1926) - que se estudia separadamente - y continuando con las tres novelas (Los siete locos , Los lanzallamas y El amor brujo) que pertenecen al período de su madurez literaria (1929 - 1931). Se sostiene que las imágenes forman un componente indispensable en la creación del ambiente de ansie- dad y frustración en que se mueven sus protagonistas. Se analiza también la composición de la imagen en cuanto a su contenido y se sacan ciertas conclusiones acerca de la consistencia de la práctica de Arit a este respecto.
