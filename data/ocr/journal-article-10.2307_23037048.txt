His readers have, it is to be feared, generally found that the sole explanation offered by him consists in the statements that: " The erotic discourse may be regarded as a master piece of its author's myth-making genius: the exemplary specimen of an art of which he has left us many other instances, but none so brilliant and elaborate"; "The rhetoric of which the erotic discourse is an example is precisely that which Plato describes1"; "The second \oyoc; tpwTLKog is used by its author for one purpose and one only—to exemplify the dialectico-rhetorical theory evolved in the sequel of the dialogue." But a reader may ask—if this is so—if this were Plato's one and only purpose—would not several other themes, e.g. Sucaioavvr), have served it equally well ? Indeed, if Thompson is right in representing the second Socratic discourse as virtually a fjLvdoXoyia 7repl SiKaioavvrig—" a mythical discourse touching Justice and the other topics of Socratic discourse"—one may be pardoned for expressing surprise that Plato did not make StKaiotrvvri directly the theme of the speeches. If his purpose was (as Thompson in other words describes it) to illustrate " the rhetoric which mutatis mutandis answered sufficiently well to our rhetoric of the 1 In the sequel.</page><page sequence="2">THE "EPOS THEME. 313 pulpit," why did he select ipwc as the text for a homily on the moral virtues ? In fact, Thompson's explanation of the choice of 'cpwg as the theme of the three speeches seems quite ineffectual. It is true enough that Socrates' speeches, and the second in particular, are, in the sequel of the dialogue, treated as exemplary in contrast to that ascribed to I.ysias as its author. They are referred to as affording models of logical definition, division, order, structure, etc. But if their theme had been awtypoovvn or SiKaioavvri, might they not equally well have exhibited these exemplary qualities ? § 2. Another question has been raised by generations of critics, viz. as to the relation between the second part of the Phaedrus (that from 257 C to the end) and the first part. Thompson's answer—so far as he attempts one—to this question is equally unsuccessful. He describes the Phaedrus, rightly, as " a dramatized treatise on rhetoric "; but the connexion between the two parts of this treatise seems to him—judging at least from what he has said—to amount to this, that what the first part exemplifies in the three speeches, as faults to be avoided or as merits to be imitated, the second part sets out explicitly in the form of rules or precepts. Here, however, the argument employed above against Thompson's answer to the other question may be employed against his answer to this also. Such rules of definition, division, classification, order, etc., as are exemplified by speeches on the tow? theme could have been equally well exemplified by speeches on quite different themes; so that no organic or internal connexion between the first and second parts of the dialogue can be exhibited in this way. Thompson himself admits as much when he writes: " In the course of the subsequent conversation the second Aoyoe tpwnkoq is more than once referred to by Plato, but without any reference to the</page><page sequence="3">314 THE PHAEDR US : ITS STR UCT URE ; passion of which it professes to treat, or to the matter, speculative or mythical, which it contains." If there be no internal organic connexion between the two parts of the dialogue—none except such as exists between precept and example, or rather any one of an indefinite number of possible examples—there is no necessity in the order of the parts. The second might have come first and the first second ; and one of the faults of composition most severely censured in the Phaedrus1 would affect the schema of this very dialogue. To suppose that it does so is not an agreeable assumption, or one which we can make lightly. In fact, the connexion between the parts is not of this loose external sort. Their order is irreversible. The second part grows organically from the first. We shall here endeavour to show this, and in the sequel to explain, also, why Plato chose the theme, and could, indeed, have chosen none other, for the speeches which form the introduction to the Phaedrus. § 3. The rhetoric which the Phaedrus commends is not that ' art of cooking' words to please the depraved taste of the multitude, which is so satirized and condemned by the Gorgias. It is a true rhetoric, differing in its basis and scope from the false. The false rhetoric proceeds in practice and precept as if the rhetorician were exempt from the duty of regard for truth and its criteria. He needs not to trouble himself about the realities of 'good ' or 'bad,' 'just' or 'unjust,' inasmuch as in the law courts and political assemblies no one cares for such things, except so far as to be able to persuade his auditors of his own views on any given question. The instrument of persuasion (to iriOavov) is to ukoq, not to aXtiOeg.

The art of the false rhetorician is a mere knack by which he trusts that he can make any thing resemble any other, and so beguile his audience into assertions of likeness or identity, while, on the other hand, he can detect and expose attempts of antagonists to play off such devices upon himself.2 He is ignorant of sound method. He does not understand the need of definition, division, classification. He cannot 'collect' or 'divide' kut eiSq.* He is destitute of training in dialectic, the essential basis of sound rhetorical method, as well as the pro paedeutic of philosophy. Writers on the art of rhetoric prescribe certain rules; but these rules do not go beyond the ABC of true rhetoric.4 They indicate some necessary conditions, but, neglecting dialectic and its corollaries, leave the learners still in outer darkness. In short, false rhetoric cares as little for method as for truth, and for truth as for method. § 4. Just as the knowledge of to ukoc must be based on that of to a\ri9{g, so the true rhetoric is based on dialectic. No man can, without exposing himself to the risk of failure or ridicule, attempt to argue about the Probable who has no standard or conception of the True.5 This being so, sound method is necessary as a means of reaching truth. Definition, classification, and order are indispensable.6 The great principle of ev /cat n-oAAa,7 with its results in the way of cruvaYwyat and Biatpicrug, is the nucleus of dialectical procedure.8 To priropiKov Phaedrus, 260 a.

Dialectic is that of which Socrates is enamoured2: it is " that which qualifies him to speak and to think." Lysias (of whose methods Phaedrus3 is enamoured), Thrasymachus, and the other professors of rhetoric lack the rudiments of dialectic; and Socrates can admire none of them. Dialectic is for Plato, in fact, as explained in the Philebus and Republic, the great organon of metaphysics, or the knowledge of ra ovra. By its aid the universals are apprehended on which his Idealism bestows transcendent reality and truth. § 5. In the Phaedrus, however, Dialectic is not named in connexion with the vision of ra ovra on which Philosophy depends. The mention of it by name is reserved for the second part of the dialogue, in which it is described as the basis of true rhetoric. The reason of this becomes plain when one reflects that in the Phaedrus Plato attributes the power of reaching ra ovra to avafivticTic. This theory, originated in the Meno and developed in the Phaedo, is here employed with picturesque effect, though with but doubtful philosophic success. It nowhere afterwards plays an important part in Plato's dialogues. Even in the Phaedrus it is essential not so much to Platonic idealism as to the particular idea of koXXoc, and the way in which this idea is made the lever for raising the soul to the world of ideas in general. What one should here notice is that the employment of the avafivTicrtg theory does not extrude the ordinary dialectical method from the idealism of the Phaedrus, but only leaves it in the background or disguises its procedure for a while. In one passage4 of the tpwe-KaXXoc myth we see 1 Phaedrus, 266 d-e. 2 Ibid. 266b, tovtcov §7/ eyooye avros T6 ipaffT^s, 8) 4&gt;ai8/&gt;e, Twy Ziaipeaecav koX &lt;Tvvaycoyuv, tV' ofos re c5 \zyeiv re /ca^ (ppope7 v. 3 Ibid. 257B. 4 Ibid. 249.</page><page sequence="6">THE "EPQS THEME. 317 how Plato, in pressing his avafivriaig, or psychological, method of the knowledge of ra ovtu, by no means discards or discredits the dialectical method, as the necessary organon of philosophy, but, on the contrary, identifies the way of avafjivrjuig with the dialectical method. No souls, he says, come into human form which have not at some period of their existence " seen the truth." . If they had never seen the truth, they would be unfit inhabitants of the human form ; for they would be unable to comply with the necessary law of human understanding. Human understanding (fcwiivai)1 must operate (kar' siSog) in accordance with a general notion, i.e. by proceeding from the Many of sense (Ik ttoWiov aiadfiaswv) to a One which it collects by ratiocination (Xoynrum Zwaipovfttvov). This process Plato identifies here with the process of avafxvrimg.2 The avanvr)&lt;Tig that brings us to ra ovra, therefore, is a process of which irrational souls are incapable, and can be performed only by souls which have the faculty of Zvvecng and \oyiofj.6&lt;;, in other words,3 those which have ' seen the truth.' If they had never ' seen' or known the truth, they could not be ' reminded ' of it. They could not perform the functions of the human understanding. Thus, in the first part of the Phaedrus, the avafivijaig theory, far from excluding dialectic from philosophy, is here only the same thing represented in a different aspect and under a different name. Plato, when, in the second part of the dialogue, he emphasizes the necessity of dialectic as the basis of rhetoric, is not introducing a strange or new 1 rb l-vvifvai-—t] £vve&lt;ris—is the faculty of ' wit' which sees several things in the light of one, and so 'understands' them. Thus, the relation between S and P is seen, and they are (so far) ' understood,' in the unity of M; many concrete individuals are ' under stood ' in the unity of their yepos; many events are ' understood' in the unity of their cause or law. This unifying function of %vve&lt;xts or ^uvayccyri (protected against mistakes by its companion, the function of separation, Siaipea-is) is the characteristic of Plato's dialectical ' way of ideas.' 2 rovro 5' effrlv avatxvi}(Tis eKf'ivwv a 7tot' 6?Sey t] kt\. 3 According to Phaedrus, 249 B.

Dialectic, as logical method, is thus substantially admitted in the ipwg-KaWog myth, in the first part of the Phaedrus, to be the organon of the knowledge of truth and reality. In the second part we read that the sound rhetoric must be conversant with truth and true method. The first part tells us what truth is, and how it is to be won; the second how it must be employed in rhetoric as an art of Sta Xoywv. If truth must be gained before it can be employed, if dialectic (whether under the name of ava/ivricTis or not) must be exercised in gaining it before it can be exercised in employing or applying it, we need be at no loss to see how the second part of the Phaedrus grows out of the first, which is to it the necessary prolegomena as regards matter and method. It is not quite accurate, either, to say, as Thompson does, that " Plato, in his subsequent references to the second 6/o(nr(Ko? Aoyog, makes no reference to the matter speculative or mythical which it contains." So far as this Aoyoe inculcates dialectic under the form of avapvnatg as the ' way of ideas,' the second part of the dialogue, as we have tried to show, grows out of the first. Besides this, how ever, attention may be drawn to a point in the passage1 in which Plato summarily refers to the tpivriKog Xoyog. There he makes Socrates claim to have, in this Xoyog, sung a "hymn in measured and solemn strain" to ""Epwg, the StaTroTijQ of Phaedrus and of Socrates." Thus, in his indirect fashion, he treats £/&gt;«)£• as the explanatory principle of rhetoric as well as of philosophy, and represents the spwQ-KaWoQ hymn as containing the common doctrine of 1 Phaedrus, 265 B.</page><page sequence="8">THE"EPQ2 THEME. 319 both; for as Socrates is an Epaarjjc, or devotee, of, and stands for, dialectical philosophy,1 so Phaedrus (the " cause—if not the author—of more speech-making than any man alive, except Simmias the Theban,"2 and the ipaon'ie of Lysias)3 is a devotee of, and stands for, rhetoric, albeit of the mistaken kind. Thus tpwc, the principle which governs the first, or philosophic, governs also the second, or rhetorical, part of the Phaedrus. § 7. The reminiscence theory adopted in the Phaedrus results in glorifying the idea of KaWoq above all other ideas, and vindicating for spaj? its remarkable character and position. Indeed, the epug-KaWog myth might be said to have been devised here merely for the sake of illustrating the reminiscence theory of ideas, only that in the Symposium, in which 'epiog and icaAXoc play a larger and higher part, the reminiscence theory has disappeared. When we have passed certain features of the Socratic ipuirtKog \0y0Q under review, it will be plain how Plato, having adopted here the ava/xviimg theory of the method of reaching ra ovra, was, as a consequence, led to adopt tpiog as the only possible theme of the introductory and succeeding speeches. Briefly, and so far merely as it concerns our argument, the k'p&amp;H-KaAAoe myth is as follows:— The soul is immortal, and existed in the transcendent world before it fell and came by birth into the terrestrial form of humanity. Even in its tenement of clay it retains something of its divine original, in virtue of which it has the power of winning its way back to the sphere from which it has descended. In that sphere, before its fall, it followed in the train of Zeus or Apollo, or some other god, enjoying blessed experiences, and especially the beatific vision of ra &gt; tov oupavou4—the transcendent 1 Phaedrus, 266 b. 2 Ibid. 242 b. 3 Ibid. 257 B. 4 Ibid. 247 C seqq.</page><page sequence="9">320 THE PHAEDll US: ITS STB UCT UJR.E ; world wherein is supra-sensible or true Being, colourless, formless, intangible, apprehensible by the eye of NoSe alone; that Being to which every ykvoq of human knowledge which deserves the name is affiliated. There the soul rejoiced to behold the ' essences' of awtppovvv Siicaioavvri, tTriarrifir), etc., as well as of koAXoc- Even here on earth, in its fallen state, it can have memories of its pre-natal happiness. It can be reminded of ra ovta, through their 6fioidj/uaTa. Of all the ovra, however, only one has a o/xo/tujua here which is visible. This one is naWog. In the world of realities naWog had a peculiar lustre and splendour ; and here even its wavering image has a brightness which distinguishes it from the o/uofw/uara of other ideas, and bestows on it the prerogative of being directly apprehensible by sense—by the eye. It is tic^ailetTTarov, and for this sole reason eparj/tiwTciTov. Were the ofxoLwfxaTa of other ideas, such as &lt;ppovtt&lt;yiQ, visible, that of koAAoc would not be the only one which excited 'epwc of itself. The other ideas also are ipaard, and, if visible in their likenesses, would excite Sstvol 'epajTcg of themselves in human hearts. § 8. Here, then, in this difference between the idea of KaXXog, with its splendid, radiant, visible likeness, and all other ideas, lies the reason why for Plato the tpioe-icaAAo? theme was inevitable as the subject of the speeches in the Phaedrus, in which he advocates the avdfivrjatg theory of ideas. Ka'AAo? is the only idea whose image appeals directly to human sense. When the eye beholds this image, a two fold effect is produced, unlike that produced by the images of the other ideas, as these are apprehended by us only St' afivSpuiv dpyavtvv. Of this effect one part is sensible, the other intellectual, according to the twofold nature of man. Ihe image of ko'AAoc necessarily produces tpa&gt;g, a feeling compounded of joy and pain. Before this image, as before the ayaX/aa of a god, men tremble while they worship.</page><page sequence="10">THE "EPOS THEME. 321 As a v-no/nrii/ia it carries the soul upwards and reminds it of the heavenly KaX\og, and of the heavenly scene in which it once beheld not KaXXog only, but kiiXXoq with crwippocrvvri ever beside it on its pedestal.1 The bfioiwua of KoXXog, in the case of one whose memories of higher things are fresh and easily evoked, terrifies all baser instincts into submission to the nobler promptings of reminiscence. If in anyone, owing to certain causes, the sensible effect prevails, 'ipwg in him becomes a source of degradation; if the intellectual prevails and governs, it becomes the means of restoration to his former high estate. The feeling of transport which accompanies it in its noble character, that is, so far as it is the occasion of such restoration, is what Plato figuratively calls the ttrepw/ia, or uplifting agency of the soul. The remembrance of the heavenly kciXXoq, once excited in the soul, sets this upon the effort to recover its lost inherit tance of ideas in general. The result is, in the Phaedrus, as we have said, regarded by Plato as capable of being described either psychologically, as a continuous develop ment of the process of reminiscence, when thus initiated ; or else dialectically, as a procedure of the higher logic, in accordance with the great principle of » ml 7roXXa, by which the same goal is reached. This goal—the attain ment of which is the aim of philosophy—is the reinstate ment of the soul in the possession of true knowledge as its heritage. The process ' upwards' towards it is the o noiujcrig Oecji of theTheaetetus, as well as of the Phaedrus ; the re-integration in man of the likeness of that Otog in whose train he had formerly the bliss of seeing ra iivra in the transcendent world. § 9.

It does not, like the Symposium? go on to explain how the philosophic exercises progress after they have been initiated, or how, in successive stages of ascent from the particular to the universal, the absolute idea comes to be dialectically apprehended ; how, e.g., the 6fio'i(oiua of icaXXoQ in the individual leads to the idea of to no\v ireXayos tov KaAov, in which the Beautiful, the True, and the Good are united in the one all-satisfying object of the soul, which also is one as Feeling, Reason, and Will. The particular form of ivOtoe fiavia called spwe is, in the soul of man, the necessary response to icaXAoe working by its o/wlm/ia. The only idea whose o/moioj/ia is visible to man is KaWog.

When, therefore, Plato set himself in the PhaecLrus to expound the operation of avanvmcnq in lifting the soul to the knowledge of ' ideas,' he was compelled to illustrate it from kuWoq and its o/Moiwfia, with the dual effect of this, as soaig, upon human feeling and intelligence. That he should have adopted this particular basis for his idealism in a treatise on the higher rhetoric, or art of .self-expression in general, is a fact pregnant with aesthetic significance. KaAAoe, the only idea in which sensibility and intellect have a common and equal concern, forms a singularly happy conception on which to found the theory of style in speech and writing. This subject deserves meditation, but it cannot be pursued here at present. lSymp. 2IOD-2I2A.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES ON THE PHAEDRUS. 323 Subjoined are a few notes which may not be without interest for readers of the Phaedrus : — 230 B.

If Lobeck's explanation of this passage, accepted as it is by Thompson, be correct, we may fairly compare Sophocles' Antigone 583-604 as affording an illustration and up to a certain point a parallel. There we find, in the house of Labdakus, just such a race as Plato, according to Lobeck</page><page sequence="14">NOTES ON THE PHAEDBUS. 325 (whose explanation there seems little reason to doubt), refers to in the Phaedrus. The Chorus laments that the males of this house being dead, and Antigone and her sister under sentence of death, it can now hope for no deliverance. Some of the very phrases used by Plato might have been suggested by Sophocles. For example, with Sophocles' ovS' airaWdarrei yiveav ysvog, compare Plato's airaWayrjv evpcro, and with Sophocles' ovS' %xei \v&lt;jiv, cf. Plato's Xvaiv iiipofitvi). The comparison also seems to settle against Jebb the meanings of ysvia and ytvog in oitS' a7raXa&lt;T&lt;TH yiveav ytvog, where the thought manifestly is that ' no generation delivers the race.' Jebb strangely, while recognizing this sense of ytvea as distinct from yivog in ytvtat; km tt\rjOot ep-nrov, refuses to admit it just where it has most point. The parallel between the Platonic and Sophoclean passages fails as regards the 'evOeog pavla, of which Sophocles makes no mention. 246 A seqq. The plumage—nrspa, nrlpw/xa—of the soul. Plato conceives the soul as a composite whole formed by a team of winged horses with their charioteer. In the souls of gods, the charioteer and each of the two horses are perfect, and the driving is always prosperous. In the souls destined to fall and to animate Qvx\tol, this is not the case. Their charioteers are of varying skill; and of their two horses, the one is of noble, the other of ignoble, propensities; the one is therefore more and the other less tractable by reason. The charioteer is the faculty of reason, the nobler steed is -o OvpoeiSlg, and the less noble to IitlQvpt\tik6v. So much is plain and undoubted. (a) What, however, is the psychological significance of to TTTtpwpa in the allegory—the ' plumage' of the steeds r and (ib) has the charioteer plumage, as Hermeias thinks ? As regards (b), in the expression vtvotrrtpov Zevyovg ts teal i)VLO-)(pv, viroTTTtpov might qualify both nouns ; but below, in 246 E, the words Zivg iXavvmv irrrivov 'uppu seem to</page><page sequence="15">326 NOTES ON THE PHAEDRUS. confine the plumage to the team. We shall proceed here on the supposition that the latter, at least in general, was Plato's meaning. As regards (a) the answer seems to be that, as TTTtpui/Lia generally has lifting for its function, so the TTTtpw/ua of the soul stands for the enthusiastic ' feeling' (in the strict sense of this word) which accompanies the higher activities of Ovpos and tniOu/i'ia when under the guidance of reason, the ijw'oxoe, and which 'lifts' the soul in its soaring flights. It has, however, no guiding power: this belongs to reason. The feeling which accompanies the gratification of the Ov/j.6 e, as such, and the activities of mere animal desire, is not nTepwpa. On the contrary, under the influence of this latter feeling—mere r)$"vrj—the plumage of the soul drops away, and it grovels upon earth, a fallen creature. The difference between the 'higher' feeling, which is called Trrepivpa, and that lower feeling (ri$ovi), animal pleasure) which causes the loss of the irripM/ua, is that the former is conditioned by the reminiscence and presentation of transcendent' ideas,' such as those of to icaAoy, to ayaOov, to ao&lt;f&gt;6v, ku\ 7rav o, tl toiovtov, while the latter is conditioned, not by such ' ideas,' but by particular sensuous perceptions. The former feeling, because of its distinctness from reason, is a variety of pav!a [sc. 17 ejoftmid}]. In the fact, however, that it is so far in alliance with reason, that only a rational idea can awaken it, it is divine. Accordingly, the TTTipwfia is nourished by divine food ; i.e. when reason is exerted in the contemplation of to koXov, to ayaOov, to a0(j&gt;6v, or StKatorruvri, (Tiinpoorrvvrj, &amp;irioTt)p.r), the ovaLa which is colourless, formless, intangible, visible by vote alone, the KvfiipvrjTriQ of the soul, then the 7iTtpwpa grows and thrives, while whatever is ugly and base causes it to pine and perish. Not of the Trrtpwua alone, however, is Tpt&lt;f&gt;tTai used. We see (247 D) that the Siavoia Otov vip re kcu tTTKTTripy aiettpartp TpttytTat teai tvirudu.

The sviraOtia here is the pure delight of knowing. Yet—we are within a short distance of the question—does not Plato, as Hermeias asserts, treat the rivioxog as if he, too, had irTtpwpa ? The pasture (vopri) fitted for rijc ™ apiarov (sc. vovg) grows in the Aajuw^of the ntSiov a\r)9dag ; on this vovg feeds ; and, as it feeds, the plumage by which the soul is exalted is nourished thereby: rj rt Sr) Trpoor/Kovcra \pv\i\g tw apicsTtyvopr) ek tov hcu Aei/uiovog Tvy^dvec ovaa, tj re rov TTTtpov &lt;jtvoig,(o ipv\tj Kovipi^erai, tovti# Tpefptrai.* Thompson,3 in his note, confuses everything by saying: " The plumage of the soul is simply the same thing with to apiarov Trig \fjvxfig."

Evnade7 used of didvoia seems to involve a psychological lapse; but we must not try to keep Plato rigidly within the rules of expres sion which scientific psychology would dictate. It is enough that in general he means the eviradeia like the irT€poo/j.a to be an attribute of the nT-qvbv apfxa ; though at times, as here, his language would almost make one suppose that Siavoia also per se has pleasure: cf. 251B iraffa [sc. r) 7&amp;P TraAcu 7TT€pc*)T^, as if not only the two horses, but also 6 fjvioxos, were winged. Of course, these abstractions are always misleading. We cannot, any more than Plato could, pull the soul into three parts, and talk consistently of its operations, keeping these three distinct the while. It is in its unity that it contemplates and feels : it does neither without the other. Even of the fiidiroia Oeov this is true ; but all here nebulous and uncertain. Plato's theory of parts of the soul was not clear ; but neither is ours. We cannot really assume Siavoia operating without feeling, any more than Plato could. 2 248 B.

Thompson1 also says: "For the purposes of the allegory the sign and the thing signified are intentionally fused " by Plato; and he justifies this by the authority of Plutarch (IlAarwvdca 2jjrj?(uara, vi), who treats Plato as having here by nnpov represented tt)v StavoriTiia'iv metaphorically, we ti\v tpv^rjv a:to tCov Tcnreiviov ku\ Ovvitwv uvacptpovoav.

It contributes to the ivSaifiovla of the philosopher—if indeed it does not constitute it, so far as tvSat/xovia consists in feeling. This feeling referred to as involved in 'eptve curiously resembles the ' moral feeling' as expounded by Kant; for it is, according to Plato, the only feeling wrought in us by a transcendent idea as its direct cause. Thus it is the process of philosophy on its subjective side. It is for Plato at once the reward and the stimulus of philosophy.

In Sophocles, Ajax 693, i&lt;j)pi£,' 'spb)Ti, TrcpL^aprjg S' avtitTafiav, 'tpong expresses ' rapture,' just as it does here, with no ' erotic' reference; and sijipi^a, too, may be compared with npuiTov /jlIv i(ppi%e Pliaedrus 251 A. Jebb there says he knows of" no exactly similar use of tpcog" ; yet he might have found it here in Plato's allegory, where, when t7ndvp'ia is eliminated, and the &lt;tkcubg lttttoq brought into complete subjection, 'ipwg alters its character from ' desire' to 'rapture' of contemplation* The influence of Sophocles is blazoned upon this dialogue. There is reason to suppose that the whole figure of the 7rrtpicpa here, with its power ptTwp'iZ,av, was suggested to Plato's mind from the popular metaphorical usage of such words as eTTTorjadal, TTTepovadai, avairracrOai, etc., to denote states of passion. 25IB.

Plato calls the second line vfipiaTiicov. It is ' licentious' enough in point of metre. It has, if judged by ordinary standards, two false quantities, Se and irTEpotyvrop'; yet it is quite possible that the v is not so much amiss as some modern critics suppose. Thompson says : " To deny the short quantity of the penult, of ipvTwp is a paradox to me unaccountable " ; and Jebb on Sophocles, Track. 1032, referring to this passage, merely agrees with Thompson. Stallbaum defends the v, saying :—" nec tamen verum est, quod Astius scribit, TTTspo^vmp' metro adversari"; but he gives no reason for contradicting Ast. It is worth mentioning, however, since none of these scholars mentions it, that Aristotle, Met. ioi4bi6, analysing and distinguishing the various senses of &lt;£u&lt;n?, says: cfrvaiQ Xtyerai sva fiiv toottov 1} twv (pvofiivwv yivetrif, 010v u ti$ eTreicrttvae Xsyoi to v : = " as if one were to pronounce (j)vaiQ with the v long." It is curious that Bonitz, in his note there, makes no reference to Plato's line. Aristotle, while thus implying that the v is commonly short in &lt;j&gt;vmg, also shows that the lengthening of the letter would indicate the use of the word in a strictly verbal sense; whether transitive or intransitive is not specified. The verb itself irTipocpvuv occurs here below 256 D. This, then,</page><page sequence="20">NOTES ON THE PHAEDEUS. 331 was a custom of speech—an instinct of the popular utterance—at least with reference to the word (pvmg, in Aristotle's time, and of course in Plato's as well. Why, then, should not the distinctly verbal notion of a "feather-producing avayict)" have justified Plato, according to the contemporary instinct of speech, in giving the unusual long quantity to v in irTepocpvTop' ? Looked at in this light, something more than Jebb's suggestion of mere ' metrical convenience' may be urged in favour of the i) of apneXo^vTopt (not apirtXotyvTopa, as Jebb prints) of Anthol. VI, 44 : rAewco7roTaig 2aTvpoiai, kal a/uireXotpVTopi Basics). In fact, though fyvTwp is certain, or probable, by analogy, no line actually occurs showing the C; while this line of Plato and the line of the Anthology—valeat quantum valet—both show v. The v is established in $vraXpiog, and (pvraXta occurs only in hexameters, where the is is, no doubt, metri gratia. Both Aristotle and Plato may have been influenced by the well-known &lt;f,vaiZooc ala into thinking such lengthening warrantable. Leaf on Iliad xxi, 63, discussing the quantity of 0W£ooe in II. iii, 243, and Odyssey xi, 301, quotes a valuable remark from Schulze on the gradual lengthening of original C on " the analogy of verbal forms with -va-" but he also makes no reference to Aristotle's olov si tic iirsKTttvac; Aeyot to v. The reading of the Bodleian is quoted by Stallbaum as irTtpo^vrov, and Stallbaum regards this as evidence for nTtpofyoirov, his own reading, derived from T. I have inspected the Bodleian facsimile, and confess that, but for the accent, which is proparoxytone, I should there (p. 235, v.) find trTipoipvTop. In fact, one of the forms in which final v is written, viz. p, is almost identical with p, if the upper part of the loop of this be opened. Nothing would have been easier, at all events, than that an p here should have been HERMATHENA—VOL. XVII. 2 A</page><page sequence="21">332 NOTES ON THE PHAEDIiUS. mistaken for an v, or an v for an p, if only the upper portion of the p had been a little opened, or that of the v nearly closed. In this general consideration, and in the curious ambiguity of B, which for v gives what is more like a blurred p, one may see some reason to believe in the genuineness of Trrepocpvrop. It may have been copied from an MS. with the accents imperfect, as in the Oxford ' Euclid,' and misread and accentuated as in B. Ylrepo^vrov puts itself out of court as a possibly true reading, for the sense which alone the form would yield condemns it. 253 D. Kat a\r)0ivriG &lt;$o£,rig iralpog. Thompson, in his note on this passage, truly observes that these four words are unnecessary, and rather encumber than help the meaning, even if aXnOivirjg could be = aXrjOovg.

If, however, one is cautious and looks up the passage in the Philebus in a good text, such as Burnet's, he finds aX^dr'ig there, not a\r)0ivri, with no mention of any variant. If he further consults the Codex Clarkianus, he finds there also (p. 185^, seventh line from top) aXvtiriQ (sic) clearly and distinctly written.

What are we to do with the re after 7rrepu&lt;pveiv ? Neither Thompson nor Stallbaum notices the difficulty of it; yet it ruins the logic.

Jowett's rendering—"that he himself had discovered the true rule of art"—is in sense correct; but one cannot be sure that Jowett (whose genius for translation often leads him to the right sense without the aid of grammar) here did not take Ao-ywv as = ' rules.' The true construction of the words (Iik Ed Xoytuv te^vhv, or Tt\vi} (after Stephanus), seems different from that adopted both by Thompson and Stallbaum. Thompson says "the MSS. have texvtiv, but the sense seems to demand Tsxvy. . . . The meaning 2 A 2</page><page sequence="23">334 NOTES ON THE PHAEDRUS. is not those speeches which art wants, but rather what speeches, on principles of art, are right and desirable ? is quasi-adverbial, as in 261 B, ypaferat T*XVV-" Stallbaum also reads and translates " quibus sermonibus s. orationibus ex arte opus sit." Ast thinks the or rexvtjv, should be deleted. All three connect \6yaw with d&gt;v, and separate it from re^iv, or t£xvV&gt; w't^1 which it appears to me to go most naturally, and with which it is found repeatedly in the Phaedrus„ For \oywv rexvri as = ' art of rhetoric,' or a ' treatise on the art of rhetoric,' cf. 261 B rac NtaropoQ koi 'OSvaoiwQ rcxvae Ao-ywv, 262 B \oy&lt;«v apa Tt\Vt]v, 271 C TexvaQ Xo-yaiv, 272 B Ao'-yaiv rtxvijc. The meaning is : " the things of which the art of rhetoric is in need"—the full conditions, rules, &amp;c., of the art. With wv Su, used without further specification, cf. oIq Stl, 244 E. Aft here, if rtxvr\v is right, takes the genitive of the object needed, and the accusative of the subject needing it. Stephanus perhaps regarded this construction of as being inadmissible in Plato—and indeed I cannot, at the moment, find any other instance of it in Plato, or before Plato, except in poetry—and hence altered re'xi'rjv to te'xj'J), so as to give the more normal prose construction. Burnet reads rtxvriv; but perhaps, after all, rt'xv^ is right. With either reading, and whatever Stephanus meant by his change, the words \oywv rexvy, or rsxvijv, ought to be construed together.

Probably the tacit supposition that they are masculine influenced editors to construe rtxvy separately from Aoywv, taking the latter after Bet JOHN I. BEARE.</page></plain_text>
