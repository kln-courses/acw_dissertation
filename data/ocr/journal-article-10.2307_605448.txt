But could the self be simply the collection of sense organs, the eye and so forth? To this the Mimamsaka replies with the above- quoted sentence, which asserts in effect that the aggregate of sense organs could not function as the subject of memory. For "someone cannot remember what another has previously ex- perienced (ndnyaddrstam smaraty anyah)"; Devadatta cannot remember an experience that Yajiadatta previously underwent. Thus, the nose, which is capable of perceiving only smells, could never remember an experience of color previously had by the eye; nor could the ear or the tongue or the skin (the organ of touch). And yet it is observed that, even after one has gone blind, one is able to remember previously undergone visual ex- periences. So there must be some principle other than the sense organs that serves as the continuously existing subject of both previous experience and present memory. Thus, the self must be distinct from the sense organs as well as the body (cf. Nya- yasutrabhasya 3.1.1). A further argument will establish that it must also be distinct from the inner organ (antahkarana). Hence, insofar as it is commonly known, or at least already proven by Mimamsf arguments, that there is a self distinct from body, sense organs, and mind, it is not necessary to undertake any new inquiry into the self. Now Frauwallner, in his summary of the text preceding the translation, makes no effort to explain the nydya, ndnyaddrstam smaraty anyah, and this rather elaborate argument in which it is embedded. It is after all a small twist in the overall argument of the section of text in which it occurs, and were Frauwallner to have explained every little detail like this, his summaries would have had to have been much, much longer than they are. Yet it is my contention that the unexplained nydya amounts to an intolerable gap for the philosopher, who indeed must be able to follow every twist and turn of the argument. To make him guess at the significance of any phrase or term in the text will be to leave him uncertain as to the exact structure of its argu- ment hence, ultimately, its validity. And although one may per- haps receive reliable knowledge of the main ideas of a text through the sort of apparatus Frauwallner provides, a philoso- pher will not be very interested in those ideas if he is not also able fully and rigorously to assess their argumentative basis. It goes without saying that Frauwallner had no intention of providing the kind of commentary upon which the philosopher, as I maintain, would insist. He merely wanted to give his readers access to the basic doctrines of schools of thought that hitherto had been almost completely inaccessible. He was remarkably successful in doing that; his formula of a precise translation along with a basic commentary was ideally suited to that task. But we should be under no illusion that it will satisfy the needs of the philosopher, who wants to be able to see, in precise terms, whether Indian thinkers came up with sound positions on some of the issues he is interested in. For the philosopher, a partial explanation of a text-one that merely explicates its basic ideas but does not fully reveal its argumentative structure-is little better than no explanation at all. And, after having met the needs of the general reader, isn't it the philosopher who most de- serves to be accommodated? Isn't it the contemporary philoso- pher with whom the authors of these texts would have been most eager to enter into dialogue? Frauwallner and his students have made great strides-and not just with these and other trans- lations but with numerous monographs and articles-in giving us access to these materials, but a great deal remains to be done before they will ever begin to have an impact on contemporary philosophy. JOHN A. TABER UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO The Life of the Buddha: Ancient Scriptural and Pictorial Tradi- tions. By PATRICIA EICHENBAUM KARETZKY. Lanham, Md.: UNIVERSITY PRESS OF AMERICA, 1992. Pp. xxxv + 284. $47.50 (cloth); $24.50 (paper). In the introduction to The Life of the Buddha, Patricia Eichen- baum Karetzky sets out both the objectives of her study and the theses that it will proffer. To the approach of Alfred Foucher who combined pictorial depictions with textual material in recount- ing the life of the Buddha, Karetzky proposes additions in two respects: first, she will use Chinese translations of continuous narratives no longer extant in Indian languages; and second, she will trace the "development of a pictorial narrative of the life cycle," or "analyze and reconstruct the pictorial and scriptural expression of the life of the Buddha," with primary concern for the "religious, historical, and cultural forces that shaped the biography in its various forms." To this end, Karetzky will rely upon, in her words, "three distinct traditions": namely, an an- cient pictorial tradition represented in her study primarily by the bas-reliefs at Safici and Bharhut; a scriptural tradition repre- sented here by the continuous narratives extant in Chinese trans- lation; and an "illustrative cycle based on the scriptures," by which she means the bas-relief art of the Kusina period. As new theses presented in her work, the author first delineates a per- spective in which the scriptural and illustrative narratives of the life of the Buddha run in a parallel course: both proceed through stages of gradual development, climax, and decline. As a second thesis, Karetzky suggests that the "evolution of ritualistic prac- tices can be reconstructed" through these pictorial and scriptural narratives. She contends that early Buddhist ritual practice fo- cused on the stupa and consisted primarily of pilgrimage and circumambulation. 750</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books Another important theme of this work concerns the determi- native influence of foreign, specifically Western or Hellenistic (to use Karetzky's terms) culture and art forms on not only the style of artistic depiction but also the character of the Buddha and the ordering of details in his biography. In explaining the appearance of anthropomorphic images of the Buddha, Karetzky appeals to the heroic mythological characters in Hellenistic culture who served as a model for the new character of the Bud- dha. This new Buddha in heroic representation also explains, Karetzky suggests, the emphasis on certain events in his biog- raphy, such as the physical feats of strength during his adoles- cence and his later confrontation with Mara. Karetzky remarks that "the Kushans viewed the doctrine of the Buddha wrapped in the trappings of a Western heroic biographical tradition." Similarly, Karetzky looks to Western influence to explain the continuous chronological arrangement of events in the Buddha's biography. No such temporal arrangement is to be found, Ka- retzky contends, in earlier scriptural material or in artistic mon- uments, which are organized by numerical similarities, subject matter, or grouping according to location. As Karetzky con- cludes, "[a]s this sequential organization of the life and the importance of an individual in society are alien to the In- dian culture, it seems clear that Western art had a formative influence[;] ... northern India was under the domination of an alien dynasty.. . [and] the indigenous traditions were sub- sumed" (p. 220). A study that attempts to relate scriptural and pictorial repre- sentations, to consider contextual reasons for changes in these media, and to reexamine artistic evidence for communal or rit- ual practice is indeed welcome in the field of Buddhist studies. Unfortunately, Karetzky's is seriously flawed on both the gen- eral and specific levels. Perhaps most serious is insufficient con- sideration of the methodological complexities presented by such a study. The demand that textual and extra-textual sources be re- lated is commendable, but there is little guidance offered, either through methodological directive or example, as to how this is to be accomplished. For her textual material, Karetzky inter- weaves details from three Chinese translations of continuous narrative biographies of the Buddha, and though she does cite variant descriptions or added events, the focus throughout is on continuous narrative rather than on a critical, comparative analysis of these differing accounts. It is also unclear which account, if any of the three, serves as the basis either for the specific events or for their narrative order that is assumed in the structure of the book to constitute the life of the Buddha. None- theless, Karetzky gives the impression that the Buddha's biog- raphy can indeed be reconstructed from these sources. She contends that by "[e]xamining the earliest extant art and the Chinese translations of the scriptures, it is clear that some of the events in the life were surely based on actuality" (p. 219). Moreover, several significant and exceedingly complex is- sues in the field of Buddhist studies are simplistically treated. On the issue of orality and textual history, Karetzky seems to adopt a model of unstable oral tradition and static written tradi- tion. She equates closure of the canon with the adoption of writ- ing and assumes that Buddhist texts were not written down until the first century B.C. This position is apparently taken in order to provide justification for relying upon the Chinese translations as the primary scriptural source for Karetzky's study. Though these Chinese translations do constitute an important literary source, it is doubtful that they are the earliest textual source as Karetzky contends, and it is not made clear why, if the ob- jective is to recover the actual life of the Buddha, the later continuous narratives should be privileged over the sporadic biographical references in Pali suttas or Chinese translations of the agamas. On the issue of the history of the development of Indian Buddhism, Karetzky assumes a clear-cut distinction be- tween early Buddhist schools and Mahayfna, such that "Bud- dhism at the turn of the millennium was in a transitional stage from Hinayanism to Mahayanism" (introduction). She offers a simplistic characterization of Mahayana and accepts without question one traditional accounting of early Buddhist schools at eighteen. On the issue of early Buddhist ritual practice, Karetzky cites only worship at stupa and pilgrimage and does not refer to the growing literature on the complex ritual uses to which textual materials were put. At other points, Karetzky presents highly questionable expla- nations. For example, in attempting to account for the absence of early continuous biographies of the Buddha, she states: "[b]ecause the Indian doctrine karma propounds that this terres- trial existence is merely one of myriad incarnations of the soul, an individual's life was treated with relative disinterest" (intro- duction). In explaining the comparative absence of early Indian Buddhist textual materials, she states: "[a]lthough under Kushan patronage numerous scriptures were committed to writing be- cause the indigenous tradition held little regard for written documents, these were not preserved" (p. 220). In offering rea- sons for the popularity of the Dipamkarajataka in the north- west, she appeals to a regional preference for local events and explains that the "reason for the popularity of this jataka in the Northwest territory can be attributed to the fact that (according to fifth century records of the Chinese historians) it was said to have taken place in this region" (p. 5). Karetzky's study is marred by numerous specific problems as well. For her contextual material, she relies too heavily on older works (e.g., Charles Eliot, Hinduism and Buddhism) that have been largely superseded by more recent scholarship. At times her writing style seems disjointed, without proper care being given to internal consistency and organization. For ex- ample, she describes certain narrative compositions at Ajanta that are to be read continuously from left to right, consistently with the style of presentation at Sanci (introduction). How- ever, she elsewhere attempts to make the point that continuous narratives appear only from the Kusana period.
