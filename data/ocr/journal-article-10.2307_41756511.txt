<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mazepa's Palace in Baturyn: Western and Ukrainian Baroque Architecture and Decoration VOLODYMYR MEZENTSEV T he lost palace of Hetmán Ivan Mazepa in Baturyn was the largest and most ambitious of his residences, and boasted an innovative architec- tural design and rich glazed ceramic embellishments unrivalled in the Cossack state (fig. 3; all figures are found at the end of this article). It is an exceptional structure for the study of Western baroque influences on Ukrainian palatial architecture. As a result of the decade-long Canada-Ukraine excavations, it has become the best examined and the most important hetmán residence in Ukraine to date. During his presidency Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine issued a decree to reconstruct Mazepa's palace after the completion of archaeological excavations.1 This article will examine the architecture and ornamentation of Mazepa's palace in Baturyn on the basis of available written, pictorial, and archaeological sources, and will show the Italian and Lithuanian origins of its style, which was supplemented by Ukrainian baroque elements.2 From 1669 to 1708 the town of Baturyn, located in Chernihiv oblast, was the capital of the Left-Bank Hetmanate and the seat of Hetmán Ivan Mazepa (1687-1709).3 During this period it prospered and even rivaled Kyiv and Chernihiv, the oldest and largest cities in central Ukraine. In the late 1690s Mazepa commissioned a spacious palatial court to be built in the Baturyn suburb of Honcharivka. It was located on the high southern bank of the Seim River, about two kilometers from the town's former fortress. The site occupied an area of nearly nine hectares and was protected by a moat, ramparts, and five earthen bastions.4 In his notorious report to the Tsar Peter I in 1708, General Judge Vasyl' Kochubei, besides the accusations of Mazepa of high treason, pointed out that the hetmán had fortified his personal court ( podvarok ) in Honcharivka with large ramparts "for no clear reason," while neglecting to reinforce the Baturyn town defenses, which had stood in disrepair for twenty years.5 According to a 1726 description of Baturyn, a wooden court church stood</page><page sequence="2">434 MEZENTSEV near Mazepa's palace. Within his fortified household a garden, a birch grove, and an arable field have been located.6 Samiilo Velychko's Chronicle first mentions the "hetmán house in Hon- charivka" in a description of an Easter celebration and a council meeting there of Mazepa with colonels and officials, or the starshyna, of the Cossack state in April 1700.7 Motria Kochubei stayed with Mazepa at the Honcharivka palace when she fled from her parents at the height of their romance four years later. This structure is referred to as a pokoi murovannyi (masonry residence) in the hetman's love letters to Motria.8 The French diplomat Jean Casimir de Baluze (1648-1718), who visited Baturyn in 1704, provided valuable observations about the "castle" of "Prince Mazepa," the "ruler of Ukraine," in a letter to one of his relatives. He recorded that, besides the hetman's private quarters, his castle housed a gala hall for official audiences, council meetings, and grand banquets. It was adorned with fine portraits of King Louis XIV of France, a Habsburg emperor, a Polish king, a Turkish sultan, and other contemporary rulers. Baluze once attended a lavish reception for the Cossack elite at Mazepa's residence and found it similar to those held in Poland. The French diplomat had occasion to make the acquain- tance there of several Italian masters and two German physicians, with whom the hetmán spoke in their respective languages.9 In his denunciatory report Kochubei complained to the tsar that Mazepa employed Polish servants and used them for his various contacts with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Porte in defiance of the Russian state's restrictions of the Ukrainian hetmans' independent relations with these countries. Kochubei also reported that Mazepa's court in Hon- charivka was guarded by 300 musketeers of the Serdiuk regiment.10 They had been recruited from Ukrainians and foreigners at the hetman's expense. Baluze was impressed by the extensive library, which contained many Latin books, and an exceptional collection of rare weapons in Mazepa's palace.11 Pylyp Orlyk (1672-1742), general secretary of the Hetmanate administration and Mazepa's chargé d'affaires, also testified to the richness of the hetman's library, remarking on its select Kyivan and German publications, Latin books, as well as medieval illuminated manuscripts.12 Mazepa's archives were probably stored at the masonry palace in Honcharivka before the destruction of Baturyn by the Muscovite army in 1708. One thousand of his documents and letters, which were seized as spoils from the Mazepa residence, have been discovered in the archives of St. Petersburg and published by the Russian historian Tatiana Tairova-Iakovleva.13 Orlyk was entrusted by Mazepa to conduct his confidential correspondence with the representatives of King Stanislaw I Leszczyñski of Poland (1704-9) and King Charles XII of Sweden (1697-1718), and he brought their envoy, the Jesuit Zalenski, for secret meetings with the hetmán at the Honcharivka palace in 1707-8.14</page><page sequence="3">mazepa's palace in BATURYN 435 In the early eighteenth century, the Ukrainian poet Ivan Ornovs'kyi (ca. 1651-after 1705) penned a panegyric to Mazepa, in which he referred with piety and admiration to his "palace of glory... a lasting monument to your deeds, hetmán" (palats slavy...vichna pam'iatka tvoiei správy, heťmane). Using poetic hyperbole, Ornovs'kyi wrote that "the hetman's palace reaches unto the heav- ens" (het'mans'kyi palats vysochiie do nebes)}5 Authoritative nineteenth- and early twentieth-century scholars, such as his- torians Dmytro Bantysh-Kamens'kyi and Mykola Markevych and art historian Fedir Ernst, state that Mazepa's palace in Baturyn was a magnificent structure constructed and decorated in a Polish style, and was burned to ashes by tsarist forces in 1708. Unfortunately, their works lack references to primary sources supporting these important assertions. Ernst only mentions that he took this information from a study by the Swedish historian Anders Fryxell (1795-1881), but he fails to provide a specific publication reference.16 Written sources attest to the fact that the hetman's palace was a remarkable and tall monumental masonry edifice in comparison to other secular buildings in central Ukraine during the Mazepa era, and that it impressed contempo- raries. These sources concur in the pictorial and archaeological data on the multistoried Western baroque architectural design of the Honcharivka palace, which was unusual for Cossack dwellings at this time (figs. 1, 3). Baturyn's development was disrupted when Tsar Peter I suppressed Maze- pa's rebellion aimed at wresting the Hetmanate's independence from Muscovy. The garrison and townspeople supported this uprising. In 1708, after Mazepa and his troops sided with King Charles XII, the Russian army, reinforced by the Turkic Kalmyk horde, captured and burned Baturyn to the ground, and massacred between 11,000 and 14,000 people: the hetmán guard (serdiuky), Cossacks, and civilians, irrespective of age or gender.17 The last hetmán of the Cossack realm, Kyrylo Rozumovs'kyi (1750-64), rebuilt the town, but after his death in 1803 it went into decline and turned into an insignificant agrarian settlement during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Archaeological investigations of the remnants of Mazepa's palace in Hon- charivka have revealed that it was burned during the Muscovite assault on Baturyn and never restored. His residence was plundered and stood aban- doned, gradually falling into ruin. Its bricks were constantly carted away for reuse until the end of the twentieth century. Today only some fragments of the palace's brick foundations have survived in situ .18 In 1744 a German collector of architectural drawings, Friedrich Wilhelm von Bergholtz (Bergholz, 1699-1771), visited Baturyn, where he made an ama- teurish drawing of the still-standing but damaged superstructure of Mazepa palace. I have examined this unique original drawing, which is preserved at the National Museum in Stockholm and has been published (fig. 1).19 Since 2003 a joint Canadian and Ukrainian archaeological expedition has</page><page sequence="4">436 MEZENTSEV been excavating the foundations and wall debris of the masonry palace and the remnants of several contemporary timber dwellings, service structures, and the domestic church of the hetmán court in Honcharivka.20 Since 2001 the Baturyn archaeological project has been sponsored by the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (CIUS), specifically its Kowalsky Program for the Study of Eastern Ukraine, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS) at the University of Toronto, and the Shevchenko Scientific Society of America (NTSh-A).21 An eminent historian of the Hetmanate and director of CIUS, Prof. Zenon Kohut, heads the Baturyn project.22 Prof. Orest Popových, president of NTSh-A, is a patron and academic adviser to this undertaking. Dr. Volodymyr Kovalenko of Chernihiv National University in Ukraine leads the archaeological expedition in Baturyn.23 1 am its associate leader and an executive director of the Baturyn project on the Canadian side. A renowned historian of Kyivan Rus', Prof. Martin Dimnik (PIMS), as well as folklorist and researcher of the Cossack historical heritage, Dr. Huseyin Oylupinar of the University of Alberta, participate in this project and the publication of its findings.24 Every summer for ten consecutive years, between 100 and 160 students and scholars from universities and museums in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Nizhyn, Hlukhiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Melitopil, Lviv, Lutsk, Chernivtsi, and other towns of Ukraine, as well as from Toronto, Edmonton, and Montreal (Canada), have taken part in the excava- tions at Baturyn. Analysis of both the archaeological sources and the 1744 drawing of the Mazepa palace in Honcharivka has allowed researchers to establish its dimen- sions, ground plan, architectural design, and ornamentation, and to propose several hypothetical graphic reconstructions of the structure's exterior (figs. 2, 3). For its time, it was a large, approximately square, centrally planned masonry edifice measuring 15 m by 14.5 m. Its vaulted basement of the same size was about 4 m deep and divided into four storage rooms of similar parameters. A rectangular brick annex (12 x 5 m) was attached to the palace's northern wall. It contained stairs leading to the basement, a central corridor, and a small chamber on the basement level. The annex's superstructure could also have housed a staircase leading to the upper floors of the palace. Its length, together with the annex, was about 20 m and its width - 14.5 m. The 1744 drawing of the palace shows its front elevation flanked by smaller, curved side walls marked with shading (figs. 1, 2). However, the curved walls in the drawing do not correspond to the rectangular layout of this building as determined by the archaeological investigation of its footing. In my opinion, the amateur artist depicted the straight lateral longitudinal walls (or, perhaps, their ruins) of the palace in this peculiar manner in order to present its three façades in his two-dimensional flat drawing. The palace had three stories, apparently with timber ceilings, and a mansard covered by a double-sloped roof- that is, five levels altogether, including the</page><page sequence="5">mazepa's palace IN BATURYN 437 basement. According to this drawing and our archaeological findings, its exte- rior boasted typical Western baroque decorations. Each floor was separated by an entablature with recessed cornices. Rectangular windows were encased in platbands and surmounted by triangular and segmental gables (sandrik); their forms alternated in vertical and horizontal directions. The front elevation had a vertical symmetrical composition. Its flanks were adorned by slim brick semi-columns with pedestals, flat shaped ceramic bases, and stone capitals of the Composite order in each story. A fragment of such a capital with a carved relief volute was found during the palace's excavations in 2009 (fig. 4). The stone construction (ashlar) and decorative materials were unusual for the architecture of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Left-Bank Ukraine and the Kyiv region, which are poor on quality building stone. As a rule, all of the wall relief ornamentation was fashioned from figured bricks and baked clay details.25 Even the immense Corinthian and Ionic capitals of the great belfry at the Kyivan Cave Monastery (1731-45) are ceramic.26 Hence, the application of carved stone Composite capitals at the Mazepa palace in Baturyn (which may have been imported) testifies to the exceptionally high standard of its construction and the costliness of its decorative materials. The main façade of the Honcharivka palace was crowned by a triangular pediment with concave wings and a massive arched central window on the mansard level. The pediment was flanked by pillars with volutes on both sides and a pitched roof. The main door had a portal topped by a shaped gable, presumably with a molded plaster or ceramic relief wreath featuring Mazepa's coat of arms in the center. The walls were plastered and whitewashed according to the Ukrainian building tradition. The ratio between the height and width of the front elevation of the Baturyn palace (without the pediment) was roughly 8:6.5 (fig. 1). This is close to the classical proportion of the "Golden Section" (8:5), which was widely employed in Renaissance and baroque architecture.27 As the palace drawing shows, its lateral façades were decorated more modestly and devoid of columns and pediments. Such a concentration of ornamental elements on the main façade was typical of Roman Catholic churches, palaces, or villas in Western baroque architecture. In contrast, Orthodox churches and secular edifices in the Ukrai- nian baroque style were, as a rule, uniformly embellished on all sides along the perimeter.28 The elaborate Western baroque external architecture and decoration of the multistoried Mazepa palace in Honcharivka had no analogies among the resi- dential structures of the Hetmanate. It clearly represents an architectural type that differed from the ordinary brick dwellings of the Cossack elite constructed according to the local folk tradition and referred to as palata, svitlytsia, or murovanyi dim/khata (masonry house), but never as a palats (palace) or zamok</page><page sequence="6">438 MEZENTSEV (castle).29 They were rectangular or elongated, single- or (rarely) two-storied, all vaulted, and thick-walled, with a different and plainer exterior design and adornment than that discovered at the Baturyn palace. In particular, the order elements in these buildings were simplified and remodeled in a distinctively vernacular fashion. The capitals of Composite, Corinthian, or other Classical orders, especially those made of stone, were not applied there. Some examples of these extant or restored masonry Cossack baroque dwellings are the Vasyl' Kochubei mansion at Baturyn (1670S-1680S), the residences of Colonel Iakiv Lyzohub in Chernihiv and Sedniv (1690s), the so-called Mazepa House (today the home of the Hetmanate Museum) in Kyiv, and Mazepa's country residence in the village of Ivanovka in Kursk oblast, Russia (1704) (fig. 5).30 The style of the exterior architecture and decoration of the Honcharivka palace derived from early Roman baroque (figs. 1, 3). From the late sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth centuries, it spread throughout Italy and the rest of Europe. Baroque architecture was extensively disseminated by Italian maestri and subsequently assimilated by local masters in many Christian countries. The composition and ornamental elements of the main façade of Mazepa's residence in Baturyn have many analogies in the baroque-era aristocratic palazzi, villas, and basilicas of Rome, Florence, Venice, and the Italian regions of Lazio, Tuscany, Piedmont, Vicenza, and Sicily,31 as well as early modern urban buildings in Western and Central Europe, particularly in Vienna, Amsterdam, and Gdansk (figs. 6, 7).32 Close parallels are found in the designs of the front elevations of the Villa Barbarigo at Valsanzibio (1660s) in Italy's Veneto region and the Villa Corsini in Florence (before 1700), 33 as well as the Jesuit and Car- melite basilicas in Cracow, Lviv, and Vilnius of the early seventeenth century.34 In a separate article I provide a detailed comparison between the external architecture and façade adornment of the Mazepa palace in Baturyn and those of Italian and Western and Central European baroque palaces, mansions, villas, urban houses, and basilicas.35 The architects of Vilnius assimilated features of the Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, and early Roman baroque styles and combined them with autoch- thonous traditions and Polish influences to fashion their own regional baroque style. It dominated the architecture of Lithuania, Belarus, and Latvia in the seventeenth and first part of the eighteenth century, reaching central Ukraine in the 1670S-1690S. Ecclesiastical and civil structures of the seventeenth-century Vilnius school commonly have clearly articulated, logical, and compact com- position and architectural shapes.36 Their external decoration is more reserved and limited compared to that of Italian baroque palaces, villas, or churches, which are often more sophisticated in their design and exuberantly embellished with façade details, stucco molding, and sculptures. In my opinion, the exterior architecture and adornment of the Mazepa palace in Baturyn, as shown in the drawing, conform to the mature Vilnius baroque style (figs. 1, 3).37</page><page sequence="7">mazepa's palace IN BATURYN 439 For instance, basilicas of the Jesuit and other Latin monastic orders in Niasvizh, Hrodna, Pinsk, Biaroza Kartuzskaia, and other centers in Belarus of the late sixteenth to mid-eighteenth centuries have a similar treatment of the front elevation.38 The masonry country residential house (1750) in the vil- lage of Liavonpol, in the Mier region, Vitsebsk oblast, and the Jesuit College (1631) in Pinsk, Belarus, as well as the dormitories of the Bernardine monastery (1773) in Dotnuvos, Lithuania, all possess a façade composition and decoration analogous with those of the Honcharivka palace.39 Recent historical studies indicate that during the period when the Chernihiv land was under the control of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1618-48), it was colonized to a considerable degree by emigrants from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.40 In 1625 the royal administration built a castle in Baturyn, the site of which is still referred to locally as the Lithuanian Castle.41 That same year King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland (1587-1632) granted a certain Dryhalo (Dovhiallo), probably a Lithuanian official, the right to settle Baturyn. The king appointed a state administrator (starosta) of the Belarusian town of Babruisk to oversee the Baturyn region, or volosť , in 1631-35.42 Researchers of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century ceramic stove tiles ( kakhli ) discovered at Baturyn and other towns in Chernihiv oblast maintain that its ornamental motifs are similar to those present in the artistic ceramics of Lithuania and Belarus.43 Oleksander Ohloblyn has pointed out that Lazar Baranovych, Archbishop of Chernihiv (1620-1693), the colonel of the Chernihiv Cossack regiment, Vasyl' Dunin-Borkovs'kyi (1640-1702), Saint Dmitrii Rostovskii (Danylo Tup- íalo, 1651-1709), the theologian and architect Adam Zörnikau (1652-1692), and hetmans Ivan Samoilovych (1672-87), Ivan Mazepa, and Pylyp Orlyk (1710-42), as well as the renowned Ukrainian graphic artists (engravers) Oleksander Tarasevych (ca. 1640-1727), Leontii Tarasevych (ca. 1650-1710), and Ivan Shchyrs'kyi (ca. 1650-1714) all enjoyed vibrant cultural, ecclesiastical, academic, and publishing contacts with Vilnius. Ohloblyn advances the impor- tant conclusion that Western European architectural and artistic influences, notably the Italian baroque style, were transmitted to the Hetmanate via the Lithuanian capital in the 1670S-1690S. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was an essential cultural intermediary between the Cossack state and the West before the Great Northern War (1700-21).44 In some of my earlier publications I have explored the hitherto little-known but significant contribution of Lithuanian and related Belarusian sacral architecture to the development of the composite Ukrainian baroque style.45 Thanks to these connections, Baranovych and Dunin-Borkovs'kyi invited the outstanding German architect Johann Baptist Sauer (d. 1700) to Cherni- hiv from Vilnius. At the behest of the archbishop and Hetmán Samoilovych, he constructed the celebrated Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (1679-95) at the Chernihiv monastery of the same name and the Cathedral of the Transfigura-</page><page sequence="8">440 MEZENTSEV tion of Our Savior (1684-92) at the Mhar Monastery near Lubny in Poltava oblast (figs. 8, 9). Mazepa completed these projects at his expense after he became hetmán in 1687. Both churches belong to the type of Latin baroque domed triple-nave basili- cas with projecting transept of the Vilnius architectural school. However, Sauer adapted some architectural forms and decorative patterns of these cathedrals to suit Ukrainian Orthodox traditions.46 Local masters altered and modified the Vilnius type of Western Christian basilicas in combination with Ukrainian and Muscovite baroque methods of building and ornamentation. In the late seventeenth to mid-eighteenth centuries they erected a series of basilica-like churches in this blended style in the Hetmán state. These are the Cathedral of the Elevation of the Cross Monastery in Poltava (1689-1756), the Cathedral of the Epiphany (1690-93) at the Brotherhood Monastery and Saint Nicholas ("The Great Nicholas") Cathedral (1690-96) at the monastery of the same name in Kyiv, Holy Trinity Cathedral in Baturyn (ca. 1692), Holy Trinity Cathedral in Hlukhiv (1720-1806), the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin at the Hamaliivs'kyi Monastery near the town of Shostka in Sumy oblast (1735)» and Assumption Cathedral in Pol- tava (1749-70).47 The most important among them were the above-mentioned Kyivan domed basilicas endowed by Mazepa (fig. 10). These masterpieces of national architecture were demolished by the Soviet authorities in 1934-35, and only their ground plans, drawings, and photos have survived.48 In all likelihood, the basilicas of Chernihiv and Mhar, constructed by Sauer, and the Mazepa basilicas in Kyiv, especially Saint Nicholas Cathedral, served as the main design models for the exterior of the Honcharivka palace (cf. figs. 1, 3, 8-10). However, one cannot exclude some direct influence on its style of contemporaneous palaces or mansions in the Polish-Lithuanian state or Western Europe. The masters who created the palace in Honcharivka could also have modeled its style of architecture and decoration, particularly the order elements, on Baturyn's Trinity Cathedral. The latter was commissioned by Mazepa around 1692 and destroyed during the Russian attack on the hetmán capital in 1708. The remaining foundations of this spacious brick church, measuring 38.7 m by 24.2 m, were entirely excavated by our Canada-Ukraine expedition in 2006-9. I have examined the results of archaeological and architectural research of the Trinity Cathedral and have suggested several graphic reconstructions of its exterior. It represented a rare mixed church type that combined features of a baroque Roman Catholic domed basilica with an articulated transept and an early modern Ukrainian Orthodox five-domed cruciform church with an exonarthex, or baby nets'. The creative architects employed by Mazepa could invent this new design in the process of the hetmarís intensive construction of ecclesiastical structures of various national and Western types.49</page><page sequence="9">mazepa's palace in baturyn 441 The Kyivan Saint Nicholas Cathedral was the first edifice in central Ukraine to be adorned with ordered columns set on pedestals on its façades (fig. 10). I believe that Baturyn's Trinity Cathedral was the second one, and the Hon- charivka palace, the third (figs. 1, 3, 4). These two churches predated the erec- tion of the palace between 1696 and 1700, and their composition and external embellishments were very similar. Thus, Mazepa's residence in Baturyn is the earliest known multistoried civil structure in the Hetmanate that was constructed and ornamented basically in the style of early Roman baroque with modifications of the mature Vilnius baroque.50 Of all the secular buildings of Mazepa's time, this one displayed the greatest number of borrowings from Western architecture. Nevertheless, archaeological findings indicate that the palace's Western façade decoration was complemented with elements of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Kyivan architectural school. The entablature friezes of the Honcharivka palace were adorned by semi- spherical plate-like ceramic details featuring relief rosettes covered with bright multicolored glazing/enamel (figs. 3, 12). Although they are not depicted on the 1744 palace drawing, numerous fragments have been discovered among the palace's debris. Archaeologists have graphically reconstructed five types of these details, each with a diameter of 34.5-35 cm. They bear various floral representations of rosettes and were mounted in a series of alternating patterns along the entab- lature friezes of the palace. Rosettes were usually applied only to upper-level friezes, but in the three-storied Honcharivka palace they could have adorned the friezes on every floor. Such glazed ceramic rosettes are atypical of modern Western and Rus- sian architectural ornamentation.51 They were widely applied on the façades and domes of masonry churches and belfries as well as some refectories and other monastic structures in Kyiv as a regional hallmark of Kyivan baroque (figs. 10, 11).52 1 have compared the dimensions and decorative patterns of the Honcharivka rosettes with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century rosettes that are stored in the Saint Sophia Cathedral of Kyiv National Preserve and those adorning extant or restored architectural monuments in the Kyivan Cave Monastery, which have been investigated by archaeologists. Their technical and artistic characteristics are similar. The type 94-h rosettes in Honcharivka are identical to these details of type 1 that ornamented several eighteenth-century edifices at this monastery.53 This comparative analysis allows me to contend that the practice of embellishing the buildings' exteriors with glazed ceramic rosettes was brought to Baturyn from Kyiv. Ceramic rosettes are absent in the other architectural monuments of the hetmán capital that have been explored.54 In fact, the Mazepa palace in Hon- charivka is the sole known example of the use of such details in residential</page><page sequence="10">442 MEZENTSEV structures in Ukraine. The employment of this method in the palace suggests its use also in some Kyivan masonry dwellings of the hetmán era. However, very few of these have survived to the present day, and their original decorative ceramic elements have been lost. The rosette pattern had a limited diffusion beyond Kyiv. In addition to the Baturyn palace, glazed ceramic rosettes adorn the façade friezes of the basilica- like Saint Michael's Church in Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi (1646-66) and the Cathedral of the Elevation of the Cross in Poltava.55 The purely Western exteriors of the Trinity Cathedral in Chernihiv and the Mhar Transfiguration Cathedral are devoid of any ceramic applications, while the façades and domes of the Epiphany and Saint Nicholas cathedrals in Kyiv were enriched with glazed rosettes as part of their blended Ukrainian- Western design (cf. figs. 8-10). 56 The decorators of the Honcharivka palace could have borrowed this practice, together with the Western-style exterior ornamental details and the composition, from these famous Kyivan churches. It is also plausible that Mazepa summoned accomplished ceramists from Kyiv to embel- lish his residence in Baturyn with glazed ceramic rosettes and various tiles. The floors of the Honcharivka palace were paved with figured terracotta and glazed ceramic tiles in blue and green colors. The green glazing of some tiles turned reddish as a result of the conflagration of 1708. The heating stoves ( hruby ), or fireplaces, were revetted with fine ceramic tiles ( kakhli ) bearing plant and geometric relief patterns and the image of an angel with extended wings (figs. 13, 14). This specific representation of an angel (putto) was very popular in both religious and secular visual art of the Cossack state, and was adopted from Western Renaissance or baroque painting and sculpture rather than Byzantine-Rus' iconography. Many of the stove tiles were covered with a commonly used green or more expensive multicolored glazing. The early modern Baturyn ceramic tiles and those uncovered during the excavations in Honcharivka have been examined extensively by specialists in Ukrainian decorative ceramics.57 At the sites of the palace and a contemporaneous wooden dwelling located 36 m south of it, archaeologists unearthed a large quantity of broken glass tableware. The glass had melted from the heat of the 1708 fire.58 These find- ings correspond to Jean de Baluze's information about the banquets hosted by Mazepa in his court. In 2009-10 archaeologists discovered, among the remnants of the masonry palace and the neighboring timber dwelling of the Honcharivka complex, many scattered fragments from at least three massive ceramic plaques with heraldic symbols, which I have identified as the coat of arms of Hetmán Mazepa (fig. 15). It is now surmised that the palace's construction and decorative materials were partly moved to this dwelling's site as a result of the dismantling of the palace ruins for salvaging and reusing the bricks. The heraldic plaques were most likely intentionally smashed during the destruction and pillaging of the</page><page sequence="11">MAZEPA'S PALACE IN BATURYN 443 hetmans residence. Many of them are covered with blue, green, white, and yellow glazing, while some have a terracotta facing. They may have surmounted the portals of the palace or been arranged together with the other tiles along its façades in series, like a frieze. These valuable finds are discussed in detail below. Researchers have pieced together the fragments and prepared a color graphic reconstruction of one of these heraldic plaques, and determined its size: 41 X 33.5 cm (fig. 16). It features reliefs of an anchor-like cross with a forked top, a crescent moon with a human face, and a six-pointed star, surrounded by scrolling garlands with leaves and flowers in the baroque style. Around the heraldic elements are eight Cyrillic letters in relief: "I. M. E B. L(. FL B. 3.," representing the initials and abbreviations of the titles of Mazepa and his suzerain Russian tsar. Six full-size letters- I. M. T. n. B. 3.- and the upper half of the character "B" (in the center of the plaque) have been preserved on some ceramic fragments (figs. 15, a, d). Only the letter "LJ" has been conjecturally reconstructed on the broken right central part of the plaque, using the analo- gies of other armorial emblems of Mazepa with his monogram. I have proposed the following reading of eight letters from the reconstructed heraldic plaque discovered in the Honcharivka palace site: "Ivan Mazepa , Heťman Viis'ka Tsars koi Presvitloi Velychnosty Zaporiz'koho" (Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Army of the Serene Tsarist Majesty). This monogram omits the letter "G," i.e., "lego" (His)- from the standard royal title, "His Serene Tsarist Majesty." The majority of the known versions of Mazepa's coat of arms include nine initials of the hetman's official title in the Russian language- I. M. Y. B. G. L(. FL B. 3.: " Ivan Mazepa Getman Voiska lego Tsarskogo Presvetlogo Velichestva Zaporozhskogo" (Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Army of His Serene Tsarist Majesty). Such heraldic images with the same monogram are depicted in several book miniatures, on metal artifacts, and the ceramic slab that was affixed to the belfry of Chernihiv College and is now displayed in its interior (fig. 17). 59 Mazepa funded the construction of this bell tower in 1700-1702. In his pre-1696 armorial bearings the Russian character "M" (i.e., the abbreviated "Ikh," or Their) was applied instead of "G" in the hetman's monogram - "I. M. T. B. M. I4. n. B. 3.": " Ivan Mazepa Getman Voiska Ikh Tsarskogo Presvetlogo Velichestva Zaporozhskogo " (Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Army of Their Serene Tsarist Majesty) in the reference to the co-ruling tsars, Ivan V (1682-96) and Peter I (1682-1725). 60 However, no fragments of heraldic plaques with the letter "6" or "M" have been found at the Honcharivka site. Actually, there is no suitable space for inserting a ninth letter in the reconstruction of this plaque (fig. 16). Moreover, an additional character would make this composition of Mazepa's coat of arms asymmetrical. Its eight characters are symmetrically situated: one above the central tip of the cross, one at bottom center, and three on each side. It should be noted that the monograms with a shorter title for Mazepa, in</page><page sequence="12">444 MEZENTSEV which the tsar's title is excluded, are observed on his coat of arms, engraved on three metal pieces, that were displayed at the Ukraine-Sweden exhibit held at the Ukrainian Museum in New York City in 2010. Thus, the silver Royal Gates from the iconostasis of SS. Borys and Hlib Cathedral in Chernihiv, which were made at the behest of Mazepa in 1701, feature his armorial bearings surrounded by five Cyrillic characters - "I. C. M. L 3." - that is the abbreviated name and title: "Ivan Štěpánových Mazepa Heťman Zaporoz'kyi" (Ivan Štěpánových Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Host).61 The same monogram has been restored in plaster, together with Mazepa's heraldic emblem, above the gate of the All Saints' Church (1696-98) in the Kyivan Cave Monastery.62 The construction of this church gate was funded by the hetmán. An early eighteenth-century silver tankard depicting the hetman's coat of arms also bears a five-letter monogram, albeit in Polish: "I. M. H. W. Z."- "Iwan Mazepa Hetmán Wojska Zaporozkego" (Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Army). This artifact is preserved at the Vasyl' Tarnovs'kyi Historical Museum in Chernihiv.63 Mazepa's precious gold sanctuarium for saints' relics ( moshchovyk ) of the early eighteenth century, which hetman's insignia is stored at the Depository of State Awards {Ordens' ka komora) at the Administration of the President of Ukraine in Kyiv, is decorated with his tiny armorial emblem executed in enamel with only three Cyrillic letters - "I. M. IT: "Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán."64 This is his briefest known monogram without any reference to the monarch's title. The length of the monogram in specific coats of arms probably depends on their size and artistic composition. A comparison of heraldic images with abbreviations of Mazepa's title shows that the tsar's title was sometimes excluded from the hetman's monogram completely or curtailed in part in an unorthodox manner, which could hardly have been condoned or even accepted by tsarist officials. For example, the luxurious gilded silver enframent (shaty kiota) of the cel- ebrated icon of the Trinity-Saint Elijah (Troits'ko-Illins'ka) Mother of God, which Mazepa commissioned for the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Chernihiv in 1695; displays his coat of arms encircled by the same eight Cyrillic characters of similar design and placement as those on the reconstructed heraldic plaque from Honcharivka- "I. M. E B. L(. IT. B. 3." (cf. figs. 16 and 18). To repeat, this monogram reads: "Ivan Mazepa , Heťman Viis'ka Tsars'koï Presvitloï Velychnosty Zaporiz'koho" (Ivan Mazepa, Hetmán of the Zaporozhian Army of the Serene Tsarist Majesty). It also lacks the letter "14" ("Ikh" or Their) from the official title of co-ruling tsars Ivan V and Peter I (before 1696) in Russian: "Their Serene Tsarist Majesty." This icon enframent from the collection of the Chernihiv Historical Museum is a masterpiece of the Ukrainian repoussé work that was a major attraction of the 2010 Ukraine-Sweden exhibit at the Ukrainian Museum in New York.65 Like the representation of Mazepa's armorial bearings in the series of miniatures, his</page><page sequence="13">mazepa's palace IN BATURYN 445 heraldic emblem on this enframent is surrounded by an oval wreath of palm leaves - a symbol of victory - and various weapons, armour, banners, Cossack horse-tail standards ( bunchuky ), trumpets, and the hetman's maces (bulavy), skillfully executed in the stamping, hammering, and chasing techniques of shallow relief. This embellishment is richer and far more elaborate than the comparatively modest floral ornamentation found on the ceramic plaques from the Honcharivka palace. Nevertheless, despite their different materials and techniques, the artistic style, design, and proportions of the Mazepa heraldic symbols and letters on both these plaques and the silver icon enframent from Chernihiv are comparable. The parallels discussed above thus support our proposed graphic reconstruction of the Mazepa coat of arms with his eight- letter monogram, which was recently discovered in Baturyn. Among analogous ceramic architectural details featuring Ukrainian heraldic symbols, besides the terracotta slab from Chernihiv College, mention should be made of a massive slab with the relief armorial emblem of Petro Mohyla, metropolitan of Kyiv (1632-47), which is housed at the Saint Sophia Cathedral of Kyiv National Preserve. It too bears Cyrillic letters- abbreviations of the name and title of the distinguished hierarch - and is covered with multicol- ored glazing. This heraldic slab could have adorned either the exterior of this cathedral, which Mohyla restored, or his metropolitan residence. This is the first find of Mazepa's coat of arms at Baturyn and its unique depic- tion in ceramics executed in shallow relief and polychrome glazing techniques. The composition, artistic molding, and color palette of these heraldic symbols and wattled garlands on the Honcharivka plaques have some common and dis- tinctive original features in comparison to other images of this hetmán s armo- rial bearings (cf. figs. 15-18). Only a few of them have been reproduced in color. Examples are known in the oil portrait of Mazepa painted by a contemporary, a church embroidery, the above-mentioned gold sanctuarium decorated with colored enamel, and a prayer book that was published by Lazar Baranovych in Chernihiv in 1692.66 A wooden door with a unique carved armorial emblem of this hetmán (1694), which was found in Chernihiv oblast and is presently in the private collection of V. A. Romanshchak, has lost its former red paint and gilding.67 The majority of heraldic representations - for instance, those found on the terracotta slab and the stucco molding of Mazepa's buildings, his etching portraits, book miniatures, metal Gospel covers, icon frames, gob- lets, a cannon, a church bell, and a wooden musical instrument ( torban ) - are monochrome.68 It is important to note that the newly discovered sample of Mazepa's coat of arms is certainly associated with his Honcharivka palace in Baturyn and reliably dates to the time of its construction before 1700. The motif of a crescent moon with a human face, like that depicted in this ceramic armorial emblem, was a familiar one in Ukrainian baroque paint- ings and relief sculpture (figs. 15b, 16). For example, similar heraldic images</page><page sequence="14">446 MEZENTSEV are found in Mazepa's coat of arms in a renowned copper-plate engraving dedicated to him by Ivan (Ilarion) Myhura-Plaksych in 1705, as well as in an Arabic-language Gospel published in Aleppo, Syria (1708), under the hetman's patronage.69 Likewise, reliefs of a crescent and a sun with faces are present on the silver enframent of the Chernihiv Trinity-Saint Elijah Mother of God icon (fig. 18). Both of these symbols were also reproduced in many early modern Ukrainian etchings and on three of the twelve Cossack flags from the Boh- dan Khmel'nyts'kyi era, which have been preserved as trophies at the Army Museum in Stockholm.70 In contrast, the form of a relief six-pointed star with a circle in the middle, covered with white, yellow, and green glazing, or with a terracotta facing, which is depicted in the ceramic Mazepa armorial bearings from his residence in Baturyn, has no counterparts among the hetman's other known heraldic representations (including the ceramic slab from Chernihiv College) (figs. 15c, 16. 17). But similar images of a star are observable on the embroidered shroud ( pelena ) of "The Intercession of the Virgin," which was made at the Ascension Monastery in Kyiv in 1692. An ecclesiastical embroidery school was founded there by Mariia Mahdalena, the mother of Ivan Mazepa, while she was the superior of this women's monastery in 1683-1707.71 In addition, comparable reliefs of six- and eight-point stars, some with a crescent, were molded on seventeenth-century terracotta and glazed polychrome and monochrome heraldic tiles, or kakhli , in Belarus.72 The letter "I" (the initial for "Ivan") that crowns the heraldic composition on the Honcharivka plaques is inscribed within a small relief oval wreath (figs. 15a, 16). Although this detail is not common specifically to the letter's decoration in Mazepa's coat of arms, various oval and round wreaths encircle portraits, medallions, inscriptions, armorial representations, and other images in many Ukrainian baroque book miniatures.73 There are also relief wreaths adorning the hetman's heraldic emblems on the ceramic slab from Chernihiv College and the silver enframent of the Trinity-Saint Elijah Mother of God icon (figs. 17. 18). The depiction of wattled garlands that envelop his armorial bearings carved into a timber door from Chernihiv oblast resembles the floral pattern on the ceramic plaques from Honcharivka. The latter were also shaped in a chiseled wooden frame. The carvers and ceramic tilemakers, or kakhliary , who fash- ioned, fired, and painted these plaques with glazing, may have patterned some Mazepa coats of arms from book illustrations published in Kyiv or Cherni- hiv in the 1680s and 1690s, particularly those engraved by Ivan Shchyrs'kyi. Numerous etchings featuring sophisticated armorial emblem designs that were created for the hetmán and other Eastern European dignitaries are attributed to this superb artist.74 Shchyrs'kyi especially favored crescent moon and sun- face motifs, and often used oval wreaths to surround portraits, iconographie or biblical scenes, and heraldic symbols.75</page><page sequence="15">mazepa's palace IN BATURYN 447 He could also draw the graphic design of Mazepa's coat of arms at his behest, which the frame carvers and ceramists employed for executing the ter- racotta and glazed heraldic plaques for decorating the main hetmán residence in Baturyn. There is a similar hypothesis that either Shchyrs'kyi or Leontii Tarasevych prepared a drawing for the Mazepa coat of arms to be carved on the above-mentioned door in 1694. Researchers have suggested that the graphic composition for the silver Royal Gates at SS. Borys and Hlib Cathedral in Chernihiv, together with the hetman's armorial bearings and the Cyrillic monogram, were also drafted by Leontii Tarasevych, his brother Oleksander, or Shchyrs'kyi, and subsequently cast and gilded by a German craftsman in Augsburg in 1701 76 The ornate façade plaques, rosettes, and stove tiles of the Honcharivka palace are remarkable pieces of Ukrainian elite applied and heraldic arts (figs. 12-16). Specialists believe that these ceramic details were manufactured not by local Baturyn artisans but by the best tilemakers of the Hetmanate, whom Mazepa invited from Kyiv to embellish his residence in Honcharivka.77 During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Kyiv, Chernihiv, and pre-1708 Batu- ryn were the leading centers of glazed ceramic production in central Ukraine. Experts in the field have pointed out the similarity between many types of stove tiles in these three large towns.78 Nevertheless, some types of Kyivan polychrome glazed kakhli and rosettes stand out for their superior technical and artistic quality during the Mazepa era.79 The view of kakhli researchers that the ceramists who adorned the Hon- charivka palace were brought from Kyiv concurs with my earlier assertion that the practice of decorating façades with ceramic rosettes was a regional hallmark of the Kyivan architectural school in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and it spread to Baturyn from there. The influence of Kyiv and Chernihiv's graphic art on the design of the ceramic heraldic plaques mounting the hetmán residence in Honcharivka has also been traced. In conclusion, I contend that the brick three-storied palace of the Mazepa court in Honcharivka, a suburb of Baturyn, provides the first example of com- bined Western and Ukrainian (more precisely, Kyivan) baroque ornamental methods found in the civil architecture of the Cossack state (figs. 3, 12). Perhaps at the hetman's order, his principal residence was modeled on the fashionable baroque palaces or villas of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Fittingly, the receptions and ceremonies at his Baturyn residence had a Polish court flavor. Research indicates, however, that the architectural design and exterior decoration of the Honcharivka palace was patterned not on the palaces of the Kingdom of Poland, but rather on those of the seventeenth-century Grand Duchy of Lithuania as well as the basilica-like churches of Chernihiv, Mhar, Kyiv, and Baturyn constructed and adorned in the mature Vilnius baroque style or its modified local version in the 1670S-1690S (figs. 8-10).</page><page sequence="16">448 MEZENTSEV At the same time, Mazepa probably paid tribute to national applied art in selecting the most skilled Kyivan ceramic tilemakers to embellish lavishly his palace in Honcharivka with eye-catching glazed details and stove tiles (figs. 12-16). Their manufacturing flourished in Baturyn, Chernihiv, and especially Kyiv, thanks to the hetmans patronage. The fundamentally Ukrainian baroque- style ornamentation of these tiles reveals some influences of early modern Lithuanian and Belarusian ceramic art. Some art historians call this distinctive mixed Ukrainian-Western style of architecture and adornment "Mazepine baroque."80 The ambitious masonry multistoried hetman's palace in Baturyn, with its exceptionally rich blended embellishments, including elements of the Com- posite order with rare carved stone capitals and exuberant multicolored glazed ceramic revetments, was unique among the secular buildings of the Cossack realm. It functioned from ca. 1700 only for about eight years, and thus its influence on Ukrainian architecture is difficult to discern. The total destruction of the hetmán capital and the suburban Mazepa household in Honcharivka by tsarist troops in 1708 brought the development of this hybrid palatial style in Ukraine to an end. Research on the lost Mazepa palace and churches in Baturyn has expanded our knowledge of the heretofore little-studied impact of Italian and Lithuanian- Belarusian architecture and decoration on the formation of the syncretic Ukrai- nian baroque style. Excavations of the remnants of the hetman's residence in Honcharivka will continue. Notes 1.

Cf. the alternative view of archaeologist Iurii Sytyi (Chernihiv National University), who maintains that the Mazepa residence in Honcharivka cannot be identified with Bergholtz's drawing of a three-storied Western baroque palace. The brick building in Honcharivka had only one ground floor, and its size, plan, and architectural design were comparable to the late- seventeenth-century Lyzohub house (that is, the Cossack regiment's chancellery office) located in Chernihiv. Sytyi suggests that both these edifices were built and decorated by imported Russian masters at about the same time.

The hetman's seventeenth-century masonry residence or office, which was recon- structed on its original site in the citadel of the Baturyn fortress in 2008, has an entablature frieze decorated with glazed polychrome rosettes. But this adorn- ment has no archaeological justification because the extensive excavations of the structure's remnants have not yielded any fragments of such ceramic details. 55.
