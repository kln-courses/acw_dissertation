A HOARD OF RADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND A hoard of 323 1 coins, which was acquired some years ago by Sir Arthur Evans at Bristol, and was in all probability found in that district, has recently been deposited in the Ashmolean Museum. "With the exception of six official third-century issues, this hoard consists entirely of radiate minimi ; with it are two pieces of metal, one a rough lump and the other a thin fragment of broken sheet-metal. In the following list the minimi are classified by their reverse types, as accurately as the degraded standard of art and the imperfections of execution allow; this is not to say that the obv. heads are not sometimes well copied from the original third-century prototypes, but on the whole the reverses form a much surer basis of classi- fication than the obverses.2 Official Third-Century Issues (6). 1. Victorinus. (Rev. [INVICTVS] or [ORIENS A VC]; cf. M. &amp; S. 112 and 115.) Cut down to 10 mm., only the legs being visible on the rev. j though the radiate head is nearly all on the obv. 2. „ (Rev.

Though hoards of this nature cannot be called common, there are a few available for comparison. Dr. Milne recently described a late radiate hoard from NUMISM. CHRON., YOL. XIV, SERIES V. H</page><page sequence="3">94: C. H. y. SUTHERLAND. Coventina's Well 3 : others that may be mentioned are the Mere hoard, at Salisbury,4 and the little group of radiate minimi in Bury St. Edmunds Museum, which probably comes from East Anglia,5 and almost certainly constitutes part of a hoard. All these hoards have one particular feature in common, namely the small module of the coins of which they are composed. Those from Coventina's Well have an average diameter of about 13-14 mm., though there are examples of as little as 11 mm. The Bristol coins are smaller, averaging about 9-10 mm., and falling as low as 6-5 mm.; they are comparable to the Mere and Bury coins, which in some cases are no more than 5*5 mm. and 7 mm. respectively in diameter. The three southern groups are in one respect opposed to the northern group, in that they offer clearer and more skilfully executed types notwithstanding the fact that their flans are considerably smaller. This can perhaps be explained by saying that the official third-century coins which served as a model for all groups alike were in a gener- ally worse condition in the extreme north, where possibly their circulation outlasted those current in the more southern districts, into which the Constan- tinian coinage would flow more readily and naturally. It should not, however, be inferred from this that the southern coins present in all cases clearly designed and well-executed types: there are very numerous examples of obscure designs, poorly struck with a meaningless jumble of dots and dashes. But, on the 3 Num.

The Bristol hoard shows none of that uniformity of fabric which characterizes, for example, Groups D, E, and F of the Lydney hoard.6 As has been noted,7 the flans present a most irregular appearance. In some cases they have been formed by clipping pieces out of thin sheet-metal : there are some forty or fifty examples of this technique. Other flans have been cast in a chain of moulds, which have left projections at either side like those noticeable on the early Roman bronze. There are several examples of quartered coins of ordinary third-century module : the quarters have been left untrimmed, and the irregular segment has been impressed with as much of the new die as possible. Many flans have obviously suffered a gradual disinte- gration through successive stages of re-striking, and it is in this connexion that we come to consider the most remarkable feature of the hoard, namely a group of fourteen coins (Rev., Pax, Type A) from related dies (12 aa , 2 ia). The flans, which are thin and irregular, have brittle and sometimes split edges, and look as if they have experienced considerable re-striking. But if the moneyer responsible for these coins used old flans, he went to some trouble to secure a fair uniformity of weight, since the coins weigh respectively 0-41, 0-35, 0-30, 0-28, 0-27, 0-25, 0-22 (3 coins), 0-20, 0-19, 015, 0-12 and (a broken coin) 0-06 gm., the average being 0-249 gm. Their diameter varies between 7-5 and 11 mm., and averages about 8-5 mm. All the coins 6 Cf. Soc. Antiq. Report , 1932, Plate XXXVI. 7 J.R.S. , loc. cit. H 2</page><page sequence="5">96 C. H. Y. SUTHERLAND. are fresh and unworn : the radiate heads of both dies are in a delicate low relief, and exhibit a fair degree of skill, and the details are unspoiled by wear. Owing to the flans being smaller than the rev . die, the latter is seldom more than half stamped on the coins : but it is in all cases sharp. There is no obv. legend : the rev. legend of the prototype survives in two letters CVA. There are in this hoard four other coins of the same type, and one or more of these possibly provided a model for the producer of these fourteen coins. This group of related coins - a phenomenon certainly of rare, and perhaps of unique occurrence among the late Romano-British hoards hitherto examined - pos- tulates their production in or very near the district whence came the whole hoard. Possibly the hoard represents the contents of an official moneyer's work- shop, since the condition of the coins is generally good, and the worn specimens were possibly due for re- striking. But it is equally possible that it may have been the property of a private individual who was capable of producing a die and of striking coins him- self. In any case the pieces of metal found with the hoard suggest that they were intended for the supply of flans ; the heavier piece, originally molten and run off into some receptacle, weighs 6-52 gm., and contains sufficient metal for twenty-six coins of the type found associated in the hoard, while the piece of sheet-metal, measuring 21 x 10-5 mm. and weighing 0-48 gm., might have been designed for the clipping out of flans ; it is punched irregularly with some thirty indentations, perhaps as a means of rendering it otherwise useless. The study of late Komano-British coinage is not yet advanced enough for us to say within what limits</page><page sequence="6">RADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND. 97 radiate minimi were manufactured or current. But this hoard does at least show, in conjunction with the Mere hoard, that the area of currency embraced the south-west of England. So much for the fabric of the hoard. A study of the actual reverse-types yields some interesting results. The approximate classification given above8 shows that the types of the Gallic Empire are greatly pre- dominant, apart from a small but definite number of types which are derived from the Commemorative Issues of Claudius Gothicus. Each class may be sub- divided into two main sections, namely, (a) animate and (b) inanimate designs. It is noteworthy that the latter are distinctly more copied than the former : of the 210 legible coins, animate types number altogether 102 coins, comprising eight varieties, of which PAX, overwhelmingly common as an official prototype, sup- plies 69 examples, while the inanimate types constitute 108 coins, of two varieties only. The impression gained from a study of these coins is that the die-engravers found difficulty in rendering the subtle and patternless curves composing the draped human figure. Of " pure " composition, involving a not necessarily symmetrical balance of lines and masses, they appear to have had little sense. Conversely, in the case of types exhibiting a certain static symmetry and pattern, they were very successful - success in this connexion being equivalent to an ability to achieve gradual transmutation of a type without losing entirely the character of the original. This technique of symmetrical stylization is appar- ent even in the less successful human compositions; 8 pp. 92-3.</page><page sequence="7">98 C. H. V. SUTHERLAND. attitudes are reduced to patterns, clothes become ail affair of certain standard curves, and occasionally the whole figure, with its attributes, turns into a purely- linear design. On the whole the various human types are fairly easily separable. Fides Militum , for instance, is flanked on either side by two vertical dotted lines - the remnants of the knobbed shafts of her military standards. Fortuna Redux preserves her special atti- tude with her right arm resting high up on her rudder- handle, though in one case her cornucopiae tails down to the ground, like a curved staff. Hilaritas is distin- guished by her palm, which sometimes changes hands and perhaps usurps the whole field in one or two cases : it is, like the Macedonian wreath, a plait-like device capable of much elaboration. The running Sun-god of the Invictus types is, on the whole, success- ful: he is unencumbered by clothing, and from his arms, his legs, and his whip quite a simple pattern can easily be stylized : in all cases but one his whip survives, and one coin shows him carrying a spear also, point downwards. Under the Pax type have been classified most of the standing figures holding spear and branch, or cornucopiae and branch, the former variety being the commoner. The branch some- times drops out, but the spear almost always remains, if only as a short baton , sometimes with an encircling crescent, turned upwards, which is the last vestige of the arm. Frequently the figure is reversed, and the ultimate stage of degradation is represented by a facing linear figure, with a short vertical rod at the end of the right "arm" and with the left "arm" ending in several radiating lines - originally the branch, but now the fingers of the hand : the head also is radiate.</page><page sequence="8">BADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND. 99 Salus is accompanied either by her serpent or her altar (sometimes high in the field) or both. Spes provides a good subject for stylization : the bent right arm, with the flower in the hand, continuing into the shoulder line, becomes a linear pattern resembling the design or Finally Claudius' commemorative Eagle ex- periences a series of vicissitudes until it becomes, simi- larly, more angular and linear than the original design. When the inanimate types are considered, it is evi- dent that they are more readily and more frequently copied. Claudius' commemorative Altar provides a good series of degradations, of varying types and designs. Sometimes it is shown with its fire on the top; sometimes it is shown in double outline, and occasionally it shows a dot or an annulet in the middle of its square face reminiscent of the common sceatta of the so-called " standard " type. Ultimately the altar is broken up into a rough square crossed irregu- larly with vague intersections. But it is the Pietas type that displays the British technique of imitation in its most complete, elaborate, and continuous form. This type, of fairly common occurrence in the third- century coinage, is found both on the Mere and on the Bury minimi , and in the Bristol hoard there are ninety-five examples of it. Curiously enough, one of the six official coins in this hoard is of this very type,9 and conceivably served as a model for some of these numerous copies. On the accompanying chart (see p. 100) an attempt has been made to illustrate the gradual degradation of the type by means of over forty characteristic examples. The prototype shows 9 See above, p. 93, no. 4.</page><page sequence="9">100 C. H. V. SUTHERLAND.</page><page sequence="10">RADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND. 101 a ewer, turned left or right, standing among a group of sacrificial instruments, of which the aspergillum and the lituus flank the whole design. Imitations of the type fall into two main classes : (A) those which preserve the sacrificial instruments in some form or other, and (B) those which omit them entirely. To deal first with class (A) : These show a remarkable stylization of the originally non-symmetrical asper - gillum and lituus , combined with the ground-base of the type, with or without the actual foot of the ewer* Types Af and Am show the type without a handle and also with two handles - the latter a pattern de- velopment of the prototype - and from each a clear series can be traced; in types Ag - Ai increasing emphasis is laid upon the "horns" derived from the aspergillum and lituus , while the handles, in conjunction with the ewer-mouth, produce such stages as An, Ao, and Ap - the latter a remarkable anthropomorphic transition. From Ao, in turn, are derived such devices as Ar - At. Type Al, though it lacks the characteristic " horns" at the base, seems to come from a combination of Ah and Ao; either the base has suddenly dropped out, leaving the top of the design perhaps as a deriva- tive of the square mouth of type Bf, or conceivably the whole thing may be inverted, since it is a fact that many of these types, as for instance Ah and Ao, lose little by being turned upside down, the horizontal top and bottom strokes being interchangeable. Type Aa is a curious example of duplicated line in pattern, and Ab shows how unimportant the base of the vase ultimately appeared to be. Types Ac, Aj, and Ak well illustrate the lengths to which an imaginative copyist might go.</page><page sequence="11">102 C. H. Y. SUTHERLAND. In class (B) Types Ba-Bc, Bk, Br, and Bu represent fairly easy transitions from the prototj^pe, viewed as a vase without attributes. Type Be originates a number of varieties each characterized by some internal decora- tion within the field of the vase-belly. The flutings on the belly in Bh are preserved throughout a definite series of types. From Bk a varied series of offspring can be traced: the double handle persists in Bl-Bo, and is perhaps responsible for Bp. The single handle in such types as Bs and Bt connects them with the family of Br : type Bq perhaps falls more appropriately after Bp.10 The foregoing variations are characteristic only, and many intermediate stages have necessarily been omitted. Nor has it been possible to trace the shape of the vase through all its vicissitudes : this, both in its mouth, neck, body, and base, varies infinitely. But, for what they are worth, these types give some help in determining the principles which actuated the die- engravers of the time. Their tendencies were strongly in the direction of regularity and symmetry of pattern. This was plain even in the case of the animate types portraying the human figure, where, even though the complexities of the subject prevented much consecutive imitation, efforts seem to have been made to stylize the figure into a pattern of prominent lines, resulting sometimes in a purely linear design. This process is consummated in the case of the Pietas type. There remain for notice only certain miscellaneous types, some of which cannot readily be attributed to 10 For the sake of brevity the first and more obvious stages of degradation have been omitted in most cases. Alter a study of the chart, imagination will readily supply them.</page><page sequence="12">RADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND. 103 known Roman prototypes. Among the latter may be mentioned a man walking right, bearing in his right hand a spear carried in rest. Of a variety of standing facing figures, some perhaps suggest Pax , but without certainty : one in particular is a superb example of linear stylization, resembling the figure Jjtj. Some types are almost completely composed of linear patterns, or designs made up of dots and pellets. Finally there is one example of a coin bearing two radiate obverses from different dies. The question of the dating of these hoards of minimi , whether of the radiate type or of the class derived from the fourth-century coinage, cannot be answered until the available evidence has been considerably multiplied. But it can at least be said with fair assurance that these radiate minimi are not contem- porary, or even nearly so, with their prototypes. There are many good examples of contemporary radiate copies in Britain : their module and their style approximate more or less to the coins from which they are imitated. The module of the Eoman copper coinage did not drop seriously until the end of the fourth century, and were there no other reason, it would on this ground alone be appropriate to assign such minimi as these a fifth-century date. Dr. Milne assigns a date early in the fifth century to the hoard from Coventina's Well,11 which includes worn coins of Yalentinian and Valens. The Bristol hoard is conceivably later: not only is the module generally smaller, but of the six official coins, three, or possibly four, have been cut down to conform with the standard size current later, 11 Num. Chron.j 1933, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="13">104 C. H. Y. SUTHERLAND. and this phenomenon is not apparent in the Coventina hoard. We might, therefore, be justified in saying that these minimi do not fall before a d. 450. The terminus ante quem is more difficult to establish, for our knowledge of the duration of the imitated Roman coinage is scarcely more than fragmentary. But, as has been noted, minimi of radiate or Constantinian pattern are found associated with early Saxon graves,12 and, in the absence of any obvious or frequent pre- Saxon coinage of an essentially non-Roman type, it seems to be an inevitable conclusion that minimi based on Roman prototypes continued to form the everyday currency of Britain for some two centuries. Any such conclusion is, however, tentative, and must only be held pending the production of further evidence. As for the question of why the radiate types were resuscitated and how they came to circulate contem- poraneously with Constantinian- type minimi , various theories have been put forward. Moreover, it certainly appears curious that, in hoards at least, the two types have hitherto been mutually exclusive: the Bristol hoard, for instance, contains no example of a diademed head, and the Lydney hoard is innocent of any radiate head. To some extent the choice of type may have depended upon the preference of the moneyers con- cerned in the manufacture of minimi , but it must also have been conditional upon the prevalent types of 12 J. G. Milne, J.R.S . xxi (1931), p. 106. It may be noted that it is at least as probable that the Wheatley coin there mentioned is of radiate as of Constantinian pattern: portions of a beard are apparent, and, in the present writer's opinion, the strokes above the face compose two clear "Spikes" of the radiate crown. No help can be derived, unfortunately, from the reverse type.</page><page sequence="14">RADIATE MINIMI FROM THE WEST OF ENGLAND. 105 coinage circulating in the different districts : until, therefore, some systematic conspectus, of the type envisaged by Mr. Mattingly,13 has been achieved, we must necessarily suspend our final judgement. But it is perhaps worth while to suggest that the discovery in the post-Roman period of hoards deposited in Britain during the occupation may have exercised considerable local influence in the matter of radiate versus diademed heads. Hoards such as those from Blackmoor14 and Ross-on-Wye15 would, in the days when minimi repre- sented the current bronze standard, have been eagerly seized upon for their metal content, and imitated as a natural consequence: the coins thus produced would circulate in clearly defined areas, particularly since post-Roman Britain appears, from its poverty, to have been an epoch lacking in extensive trade. In support of this theory it may be observed that the Bristol hoard shows coin-types representative of a character- istic third-century hoard, allowing for the fact that, in the process of imitation, certain types would be favoured (as for instance Pietas) to the exclusion of others. Here again, however, we must be content to speculate, and to hope that further discoveries will throw more light on a period of Roman numismatics which is as obscure and as interesting as any other before it. 13 J.R.S. xxii (1932), pp. 88 ff. 14 Num .
