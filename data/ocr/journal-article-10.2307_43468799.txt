<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Passage to More than India The Poetry of Gary Snyder ABRAHAM ROTHBERG Forming the new society within the shell of the old. - I.W.W. SLOGAN because SO many of the conflicting traditions in American culture meet in his life and work, Gary Snyder is both a symbolic and symptomatic figure in contemporary letters. Frontiersman and city man; man of action and contemplative; common man and intellectual; radical Wobbly, con- servative ecologist, and "reactionary" anthropologist; Oriental and Occi- dental; Anglo and Amerindian; male chauvinist and worshiper of the "great goddess, the Magna Mater," Snyder's contradictions seem to have arisen out of a highly sensitive philosophical nature, a keen intelligence, a very particular personal life experience, and an intense reaction to his time and place. Snyder grew up in the marginal farmlands of eastern Oregon in what he thought of as a "typical western" family. His father was born in the state of Washington, where his grandfather was a home- steader; his mother's family came from the vicinity of Leadville, Colo- rado. His father's five brothers were seamen; his mother's brothers were railroad men: all of them were traveling, restless, pioneering outdoors- men who thought of themselves as "westerners." Snyder's immediate family was dirt poor - subsistence farmers who raised some animals - and his father worked as a logger to keep them and the farm going. His poetic description of them in "Dusty Braces" is surely accurate: my fathers and grandfathers, stiff-necked preachers, miners, dirt farmers, railroad-men killd off the cougar and grizzly 26 winter 1976</page><page sequence="2">nine bows. Your itch in my boots too, - your sea roving tree hearted son. Born in 1930 in the midst of the great Depression, from boyhood Snyder lived close to nature and responded strongly to it. Around him he saw the ravages of the bulldozer and the chain saw, of exploitation and greed, on the beauty of the Oregon woods, on the animals and wild life, on the Indian. From his paternal grandfather he learned about the politics of the Industrial Workers of the World, and one of the I.W.W. slogans, "forming the new society within the shell of the old," subsumes Snyder's later political views and commitments. With the evidence around him that the white man did not understand nature, did not even know the names for the diversity of plants, trees, and animals, Snyder turned to the Indians of the Northwest who did know their names and seemed to have some sense of how a life harmonious with nature might be lived. By his own account, he later deliberately resolved this pull on him between traditions in favor of the Amerindian way of life rather than the one big union of the Wobblies. Nevertheless, conscious choice notwithstanding, his work and his life show that the traditions have in fact been blended and almost inextricably intertwined. Although Snyder prefers to stress his informal education, the life he has led as lumberjack, firewatcher, hunter, trapper, sailor, bum - the clas- sical settings for Wobblies - he has had considerable formal schooling. Graduated from Reed College in 1951 after having studied anthropology- there, he took advanced work in linguistics at Indiana University the fol- lowing year, then from 1953 to 1956 studied Chinese and Japanese and Asiatic culture at the University of California at Berkeley. From 1956 to 1963 he lived in the Far East, for the most part in Japan, spending a por- tion of his time there in a Zen Buddhist monastery on the outskirts of Kyoto. For a year thereafter, from 1964 to 1965, he taught at Berkeley,, and in the three years after that he won three major awards for his poe- try: the Bollingen in 1966-67, the Poetry Award of the National Insti- tute of Arts and Letters, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1968-69. In 1975, he was also awarded the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. If Snyder prefers to scant his accomplishments as anthropologist, linguist, teacher,, translator, and poet - the "highbrow" and intellectual - and to stress SOUTHWEST Review 27</page><page sequence="3">his hardier roles as woodsman, hunter, able-bodied seaman, or hobo - the "lowbrow" and common man - he cannot quite conceal the in- tellect or learning in his work, which everywhere reveals his consider- able knowledge of anthropology, linguistics, Zen Buddhism, history, and other arcane lore. His poetic persona is that of the ordinary man of Walt Whitman, but even Whitman exaggerated his "ordinariness" (as well as his "extraordinariness" ) , and so does Snyder. Yet a poet does more than choose his tradition; in a very real sense he is chosen by it as well, and Snyder has come to the reservoirs of the Orient and of the American In- dian not only as an act of will but out of a deep-seated and passionate need. Whatever his university degrees and academic accomplishments, he wishes to be considered a poet of ordinary men, writing in a language shaped in their idiom; whatever his origins, he has deliberately identified himself with cultures other than his own. Though we must respect and understand his intentions, we are not required to let them mislead our view of what he has, in fact, achieved. And there is ample truth to what he says in "Lookout's Journal": one does not need universities and libraries one need be alive to what is about Snyder's selection of the bardic tradition of the common man runs in an erratic line from the Transcendentalists through Walt Whitman to William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, and Robinson Jeffers to the "Beats" and the San Francisco poets. Like his poetry, his choice of men- tors and traditions is clearly a reaction against "high culture" and what Western industrialism and greed, traditional uses of Western intelligence and "reason" have done to the natural world and to man. Snyder's work is certainly a part of that rebellion of the "flower children" and the "Beats" against American life in the twentieth century, their turning to the Orient and Zen Buddhism as part of an overall disillusionment with Western industrialism and "progress," with Western religion and cul- ture. They are, though not in the Kennedy sense, in search of a new frontier. But because the old frontier ended on the shores of the Pacific, they now want to take that next - and giant - step from California, Oregon, and Washington across the ocean, that "passage to more than India," which is both an affirmation of American "manifest destiny" and a simultaneous denial of it, a nostalgia for the old frontier and a hope 28 winter 1976</page><page sequence="4">for a new one. Since San Francisco is America's port to the Orient, the "flower children" and the "Beats" find their natural locus there. Snyder s roots are deep in Whitman and the Transcendentalists of New England, whose own roots were in German idealism, English ro- manticism, and Oriental (chiefly Hindu) mysticism. Like Whitman, Snyder celebrates nature, the simple, the animal, the sexual, the tribal, the self. Like Whitman, he speaks in the voice of a highly personal per- sona rooted in his own experience but by no means identical with it. Like Whitman, he sees man as an indissoluble part of the natural envir- onment, flourishing when he accepts and adapts to that natural heritage, creating a hell on earth and within himself when he is separated from it by his intellect and its technological and societal creations. Like Whit- man and Thoreau, though more thoroughly and intensely, Snyder wishes to live in nature and there to confront himself and the essentials, and like Emerson and Thoreau, he does not wish to be saddled with things . Like Whitman and Thoreau, he celebrates physical labor, its joys and its ability to educate one in the "true" sense. Snyder maintains truly though perhaps not all-inclusively that his poetics have been most in- fluenced by the jobs he has held, that he has learned how to place words in a line by moving stones. Work, he says, is for him a form of play, and he has learned most from such work as he has performed. From this arises his definition of poetry in "Poetry and the Primitive" as the skilled and inspired use of the voice and language to embody rare and powerful states of mind that are in immediate origin personal to the singer, but at deep levels common to all who listen. . . . Poetry must sing or speak from authentic experience." Like Emerson, Snyder understands that nature can be approached and understood not by reason but only by intuition. In this he has gone beyond Transcendentalism's "meditation" to the disciplines of Zen Budd- hism, the abandonments of primitive ritual, the depths of dream and myth, and to the release of drugs - peyote, hashish, LSD - to help pierce the phenomenal veil of nature and thereby to enter into its nou- menal reality. Like Emerson, he perceives that noumenal reality not as an anthropomorphic God, but possibly as a form of harmonious Oversoul. A more stoic and pessimistic note in Snyder's poetry, deriving in part from Robinson Jeffers, is a sense of the inescapability of natural systems and how men are part of them. Man, Snyder recognizes, is a destroyer and Anglo-Saxon man particularly pernicious, though he is by no means southwest Review 29</page><page sequence="5">alone, for among others even the Chinese made deserts by chopping down their trees, and to build their galleys the Romans logged off the Yugo- slav hills and left them bare. What is good in men, Snyder believes, is in their natural relationship to the animals and the earth; but only primi- tive, archaic, and preindustrial men, such as the American Indians, seem able to establish and maintain such natural relationships. Many of these themes are apparent in Snyder's poem "Night Highway Ninety-nine," the record of a long hitchhiking trip from the state of Washington to San Francisco with Allen Ginsberg. The poem is Snyder's "I Hear Amer- ica Singing," but the America he depicts is profoundly different from Whitman's; this is twentieth-century America, full of drunken Indians picking strawberries and speaking Kwakiutl, of itinerant Mexicans who need money for gasoline for their broken-down cars so they can work as migrant laborers, of drunken whores, of lumber-mill workers who lose their fingers to tricky sawmill machines, of sheriffs' posses who flog naked Wobblies and run them out of town, a country of "waste of trees &amp; topsoil, beast, herb," a "mess of tincan camps and littered roads." Snyder is aware of the poverty, pain, and despair not only of the American landscape, but of other landscapes as well. In one of his more successful poems he sets up a series of serious and ironic equivalents of what can be bought in various places for the labor involved in work- ing seventy-five feet of hoed rows, asking what anything is "worth" in human terms - "Value is price," the modern economists tell us - and in three powerful stanzas of his poem "The Market" portrays the most ab- ject and inhuman misery of Oriental India: they eat feces in the dark on stone floors, one legged animals, hopping cows limping dogs blind cats crunching garbage in the market broken fingers cabbage head on the ground. who has young face. open pit eyes between the bullock carts and people 30 winter 1976</page><page sequence="6">head pivot with the footsteps passing by dark scrotum spilld on the street penis laid by his thigh torso turns with the sun I came to buy a few bananas by the ganges while waiting for my wife. Snyder's anger and compassion are as much aroused by what men do to other men as by what they do to nature. In "Mother Earth: Her Whales" he writes: And Japan quibbles for words on what kinds of whales they can kill? A once-great Buddhist nation dribbles methyl mercury like gonorrhea in the sea. Ah, China, where are the tigers, the wild boars the monkeys, like the snows of yesteryear Gone in a mist, a flash, and the dry hard ground Is parking space for fifty thousand trucks. For Snyder, America is the worst land of the rip-off, the country of the most careless rapine of nature, and in "Front Lines" he most scathingly indicts it: The edge of the cancer Swells against the hill - we feel a foul breeze - And it sinks back down. The deer winter here A chainsaw growls in the gorge. Ten wet days and the log trucks stop, The trees breathe. southwest Review 31</page><page sequence="7">Sunday the 4- wheel jeep of the Realty Company brings in Landseekers, lookers, they say To the land, Spread your legs.

Behind is a forest that goes to the Arctic And a desert that still belongs to the Piute And here we must draw Our line. Snyder's "private" voice may be distinguished from his more "public" voice, and it has produced some of his best poetry. Those poems speak of simple sensuous experiences - hunting, fishing, swimming, dancing, drinking, eating; or sensuous responses to nature - animals and birds, flowers and trees, the sights, sounds, and smells of earth. Among these are "Yase: September," "The Public Bath," and "The Bath." Other "pri- vate" poems deal with the complexities of sexual experience, of love lost and found, of life with wife and children, and include "After Work," "September," "Night," and "How Many Times." Among the most mov- ing are two intensely personal nostalgic love poems, evidently autobio- graphical in inspiration, and both addressed to the same woman: "De- cember at Yase" and "A spring night in Shokoku-ji": Eight years ago this May We walked under cherry blossoms At night in an orchard in Oregon. All that I wanted then Is forgotten now, but you. Here in the night In a garden in the old capital 32 winter 1976</page><page sequence="8">I feel the trembling ghost of Yugao I remember your cool body Naked under a summer cotton dress. Oddly, though Snyder celebrates sex and the body, his poetry deals with an almost all-male world in which women are either sexual objects, not infrequently whores ("Japanese whores are the kindest, cleanest, in the world" he writes in "Tanker Notes." "And Goddamit, you really can't ever understand them or can they you"), or objects of worship - goddesses of nature, Astarte, Aphrodite, Cybele (in "Burning Island" we have "O Earth Mother/ I have wrappt my hand/ over the jut of your cobra-hood/ sleeping;/ left my ear/ All night long by your mouth"). Snyder has a programmatic commitment to free-form marriage, matrilin- eal descent, and polyandry, but in his poetic tension between venery and veneration there is something disconcerting which is (perhaps unwit- tingly) reinforced by the down-to-earth language he uses to anchor him- self against his transcendence. Yet the knots are in some measure loosened, if not quite untied, by his sense of humor about and his humane understanding of the tragedy inherent in sexual relations. Like other poets in the bardic tradition, and like the Amerindians he admires, Snyder wishes to use colloquial speech, folkways, and folk myth as means of examining the lives of common men in order to clarify and communicate their experience to them. In Snyder this combines qualities of the "Beat" poets "on the road" and the Japanese itinerant poets - like Basho - with those of the wandering Indian shaman and the vagrant bindlestiffs in the Wobbly hobo camps and union halls. Snyder's approach is subsumed by the old Whitmanesque emphases on the flesh and spon- taneity. In Whitman's poetry the celebration of the flesh was as much a rebellion against Transcendentalism's aerial qualities, against the ascetic- ism of Emerson and Thoreau, as a way of carrying forward Transcen- dentalism's demands for transcendent experience. Like so many of his poetic contemporaries, Snyder takes a further step in his desire to achieve transcendence: he calls not only for sensuous and sexual experience to free the body and "clear the head," but also for drugs to fulfill that same urgent need for transcendence. Both sex and drugs celebrate the phenom- enal in nature - the material in the world and the body in man; but they also lift man's mind and spirit out of the phenomenal into the realm of the noumenal - the realm of the essence of reality, or mind of God, or southwest Review 33</page><page sequence="9">Oversoul, toward which American transcendentalism, Oriental Zen, and the Amerindian peyote cults alike aspire. In his very best book of poems, Myths and Texts , Snyder tries to explain that "the glimpses of the roots of religion I'd seen through meditation, peyote and 'secret frantic rituals' / order life/ into one whole thing." As with the Transcendentalists, the purpose of these various means - Zen contemplation, drugs, Amerindian rites - is to achieve a sense of unity in diversity, order in chaos, godhead in nature, a way of proceeding through sense and intuition into the very essence of reality. This desire produces one of Snyder's best poems, "Journeys": We were following a long river into the mountains. Finally we rounded a ridge and could see deeper in - the farther peaks stony and barren, a few alpine trees. Ko-san and I stood on a point by a cliff, over a rock-walled canyon. Ko said, "Now we have come to where we die." I asked him, what s that up there, then - meaning the further mountains. "That's the world after death." I thought it looked just like the land we'd been travelling, and couldn't see why we should have to die. Ko grabbed me and pulled me over the cliff - both of us falling. I hit and I was dead. I saw my body for a while, then it was gone. Ko was there too. We were at the bottom of the gorge. We started drifting up the canyon, "This is the way to the back country." Though such mysticism has religious overtones, it is by no means formal religion. Snyder's work reveals his profound hatred for the Judeo- Christian tradition, which he credits with the destruction and exploita- tion of the sacred in man and physical nature by its alliance with and support of a predatory capitalism. Together, he asserts, Christianity and capitalism combine to emasculate the natural in man by insisting on in- hibition and repression, by crushing the nerves of joy, so that men can- not partake of the primitive celebration of the sacred self. This rage against Christianity and capitalism has produced two of Snyder's very best poems, one of which, No. 14 of "Logging," may be as close as he has come to writing a great poem: 34 winter 1976</page><page sequence="10">The groves are cut down cut down Groves of Ahab, of Cybele Pine trees, knobbed twigs thick cone and seed Cybele's tree this, sacred in groves Pine of Seami, cedar of Haida Cut down by the prophets of Israel the fairies of Athens the thugs of Rome both ancient and modern; Cut down to make room for the suburbs Bulldozed by Luther and Weyerhaeuser Crosscut and chainsaw squareheads and finns high-lead and cat-skidding Trees down Creeks choked, trout killed, roads. Sawmill temples of Jehovah. Squat black burners 100 feet high Sending the smoke of our burnt Live sap and leaf To his eager nose. The second, cryptically entitled "Xrist," is also a very forceful poem, but not quite so well controlled: Your hanging face I know, I know your tree.

The bruised snake coils in the grass He is wise; there are trees in high places; Keep your blood off the crotch of our tree. But Christian love continues to haunt Snyder's work and he sees it in various Christian (and other) heresies which over mankind's history have been suppressed by various orthodoxies without being destroyed. These heresies constitute, he says in "Passage to More Than India," "the Great Subculture which goes back as far perhaps as the late Paleolithic," and is an "ancient shamanistic-yogic-gnostic-socioeconomic view: that mankind's mother is Nature and Nature should be tenderly respected; that man's life and destiny is growth and enlightenment in self-disci- plined freedom; that the divine has been made flesh and that flesh is divine; that we not only should but do love one another." From the Hebrew prophets and the Christian sages Snyder extracts the dream of the Millennium which is "a dream handed down right to our own time - of ecological balance, classless society, social and economic freedom" that is as much Amerindian as Wobbly, as much ecological as socialist, as much the best of the pagan as of the Judeo-Christian tradition. The major problem in Snyder's poetry is that he can rarely achieve the unity of thought and language required of a good poem. Usually, he is caught up in that poetic quicksand that swallows so much of the work of Whitman and Carlos Williams and the "Beats": the cataloging of na- tural objects, mundane events, and sensory impressions until they are meaningless and boring. In short, there is a failure of poetic discrimina- tion and organization which is in itself a failure of sensibility. This sort of cataloging is rooted in the notion that all Snyder's experiences, thoughts, and perceptions, as well as those of his friends, are interesting to others; and it, too, arises out of the Transcendentalist notion that in essence every man is a paradigm of all men and of mankind. It produces a preoccupation with personal anecdote that is too often trivial and pre- tentious, a reiteration of what Allen (Ginsberg) or Peter (Orlovsky) or 36 winter 1976</page><page sequence="12">Joanne (Snyder's first wife) or Masa (Snyder's second, Japanese wife) or a host of others, unknown and uninteresting to the uninitiated, said or did. Moreover, it leads to Snyder's memorializing his own most banal thoughts and unimportant activities as though they had some profound and widespread significance. Consequently, a great deal of the poetry is the enshrining of casual observations and recollections, unyoked to broader human concerns and rendered in a language devoid of originali- ty or beauty. If either the experiences or the language are meaningful to Snyder, he fails to communicate their importance to his readers. To give only one example, which regrettably could be multiplied to include a sub- stantial part of Snyder's oeuvre , here is a poem (No. 13 in "Hunting") that is not much more than a market list or a Whole Earth Catalogue: Now I'll also tell what food we lived on then: Mescal, yucca fruit, pinyon, acorns, prickly pear, sumac berry, cactus, spurge, dropseed, lip fern, corn, mountain plants, wild potatoes, mesquite, stems of yucca, tree-yucca flowers, chokecherries, pitahaya cactus, honey of the ground-bee, honey, honey of the bumblebee, mulberries, angle-pod, salt, berries, berries of the one-seeded juniper, wild cattle, mule deer, antelopes, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, doves, quail, squirrels, robins, slate-colored juncoes, song sparrows, wood rats, prairie dogs, rabbits, peccaries, burros, mules, horses, buffaloes, mountain sheep, and turtles. One of the great problems for all poets in trying to see things fresh- ly and eternally at the same time is: how do you make it new? Or to ap- ply to his poetic the old I.W.W. slogan that Snyder is so fond of using in other contexts: how do you shape the new within the shell of the old? In the main, Snyder's poetry fails to do just that, but relies instead on a relatively commonplace and perfunctory system of poetic notation for the old so that, instead of creating the uniqueness and diversity he extols, Snyder lapses into a homogeneity and repetitiveness that quickly palls and often appalls. SOUTHWEST Review 37</page><page sequence="13">Yet there are perhaps a dozen poems that are really fine - and of how many poets can one say that? If Snyder is by no means a great poet, he does have some important things to say about twentieth-century man's pell-mell progress toward environmental and societal disaster, toward destroying the place in which he lives, his home, the earth, as well as his mind, body and spirit; and occasionally, though only occasionally, he is able to embody what he has to say in memorable language, in striking form.
