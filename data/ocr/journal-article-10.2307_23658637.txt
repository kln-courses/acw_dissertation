Having terature on the role of The appearance of these volumes raises hopes that effective international coopération and the generosity of few scholars can reach great sci entific achievements in our age when classical Indology very much lacks fînancial support overall in Europe. The series of Pandanus Work shops stirs up the back-water of the history of Sanskrit and Tamil literature, gives a new im petus to methodological investigations and com parative studies at a pan-Indian level. Pandanus，Ol contains the papers read in the seminar Research in Indiati Kävya Litera ture, held in Milano on May 25 -26,2001. A. Dubiansky examined the special features of use of colours in Old Ta reviewed the theoretical literati so-called basic colours such as white, black and red in a given culture he turns to the intricating issue of the ambivalence in the interprétation of the black colour. He justly assumes that black colour is simply conceived as the absence of light and green is not one of the primary col ours but it shares features of black/blue. On account of the story of Lila Bruno Lo Turco discusses the problem of correct under standing of the word of the ordinary expéri ence. The paper is a valuable contribution to Moksopäya studies. G. Milanetti highlights certain delicate is sues of the Sanskritised Hindi language and poetry and literary criticism together with the political or rather nationalist overtones behind these phenomena. G. Pellegrini treats the peculiar place of science or at least knowledge in poetry. He justly dwells upon Ksemendra's discussion of the Acta Orient. Hung. 57, 2004</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 247 intentions and ends of poetry (p. 72). Among others he présents a fascinating interprétation of the stanza 138VR from Hâla’ SattasaT (pp. 76 ff.). Here I feel the need of an outlook at the Ksemendra' oeuvre particularly to his Samaya mâçkâ a masterpiece of didactic poetry. His countryman Dâmodaragupta takes great delight in making a parade of his scientific knowledge and éducation. Cinzia Pieruccini makes a review of the his torical development of the cakraväka bird mo tives from Vedic times to mature kâvya. She convincingly states that turning points in this developments are to be found in the Râmâyana in the works of Kâlidâsa. From Daniela Rossela's paper we learn a great deal on the cultural impact of Indian stori es on western music. The nineteenth Century li brettists willingly chosed Indian subject either from classical authors or Indian ones. Indian literature was very much populär and the libret tists used scientific translations (p. 109). J. Vacek gave up oneself to a study of the formai and semantic structure of formulas con nected with plant names in Old Tamil litera ture. At the end of his p叩er he raise a thought provoking question concerning the literary sig nificance of these formulae (pp. 156-157). A. Wezler's paper is a report on a project of University of Hamburg the aim of which is to persuade Indologists to pay more interest to lit erary theory and its application and applicabilty to Indian literatures. He justly reminds us that the existence of literary theory is known only to the ‘happy few，who can read texts in Indian languages. As to the applicability of indigenous Indian literary criticism his opinion is that it needs “a much more extensive and less naive study” than it has been done. At any rate it is not the unique key to understanding kâvya. In order to let us to have a glimpse at the recent work in Hamburg he shares with us some of his ideas on Annette Mangels，doctoral dissertation under the title Zur Erzähltechnik des Mahä bhärata. Wezler acknowledges that the work breaks new ground in the research of narrative techniques. The whole paper is inspiring but a little bit too ambitious therefore we can only wait for concrète results of the project or at least for the élaboration of some sparkling ideas cramed into this p^)er. Pandanus '02 is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Bernhard Kölver who was one of the initiator of the Pandanus Workshops and who passed away in 2001. Most of the papers in cluded in this volume were read at a seminar in Prague in the end of May 2002. The volume opens with a short commemo rative paper of Prof. Kölver written by A. J. Gail and houses eleven articles. The subjects pre sented here are taken from Sanskrit and Tamil literature, classical Indian art, Bengali litera ture, folklore, ritual and tribal anthropology. A. Dubiansky's article is devoted to the po etical thèmes noci and ulifiai two plant names and shows that theoreticians, Compilers and modem interprétations can be controversial. A. J. Gail in his finely illustrated paper in vestigates the appearance and rôle of lotus (padma) and water lily (utpala) in Indian reli gious art. I may draw attention to two points in this paper: the difîerentiating fonction of these plants in the case of LaksmT and BhödevT; the appearance of lotus in one of the four hands of Visnu. M. Hribek is the author of a very interest ing paper on the ritual use of plants in Durgâ worship.The study is the resuit of field-work in Calcutta, research in literary sources and theo retical literature. He points out that ail the plants listed in this rite are of practical use and that the présent day püjä originates in folk rites of rural agriculturists. Systematic interprétation is hindered by the circumstance that the rite con sists of elements deriving from différent âges and cultural contexts. I think that research in Durgäpüjä can be canied out as a team work a good example of which was the German Orissa project where among others the Jagannätha cuit has been investigated by specialists of various disciplines. S. Lienhard explores the différent fields of meaning of Sanskrit rakta/ lakta "blood" and “lac” in Sanskrit and Prakrit texts involving Dravidian analogies and properly demonstrates Acta Orient. Hung. 57, 2004</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS that rakta，lakta and alakta are variants of one and the same word. H. Novâkovâ deals with the rôle of nature in the tradition of Adivasi tribes in West Ben gal. It is in fact a brief survey of their culture with references on their attitudes to nature. She pays due attention to the cultural counteracts be tween the tribal population and the great tradi tion. Here I wonder why she consequentiy uses the term “small tradition’，in place of the Stand ard "little tradition". She raised some puzzling ideas worth pursuing. For instance the horses are regarded as enemies bringing destruction in création myths and it is interpreted as a "clear" reflexion of the Aryan invasion. As to special ised literature used in the article I find wanting the studies written by the excellent German an thropologist Lydia Icke-Schwalbe who has done field-work in Chota-Nagpur etc. Having examined selected passages of the Äranyakaparvan of the Mahäbharata Cinzia Pie ruccini reaches the conclusion that descriptions are made on the basis of true observation of nature. At the same time poets easily create stereotypes which ultimately help us to imagine a landscape in wild ancient India. She rightly says that Epies are surely sources of poetical motifs of kävya. One brief remark invites me for a discussion. She regards these landscapes as uninhabited tracks (p. 94). In my opinion they are not necessary uninhabited, on the contrary frequently they give home to men in exile or ascetics. (Cf. especially W. Rüben: Waldaben teuer des indischen epischen Helden. Berlin 1962, with rieh material.) H. Preinhalterova has undertaken an analy sis of Bengali proverbs connected with the cow. Her careful analysis based on the Bâmlâ prabäd charâ o calti kathä (ed. by S.K. De, Calcutta 19522) and her collection of sayings yields significant observations: in the proverbs cow mostly appears as a usefùl animal of great economical value; cow is the bearer of a com plex character; she is a means of mockery of tra dition and even the brähmanas. Daniela Rossella who also translatée! first the whole BhäminTviläsa of Jagannätha into a Acta Orient. Hung. 57, 2004 Western language, namely Italian, deals in her article with the natural characters depicted in the first canto of this work. She can demon strate that these elements are very much able to describe human sentiments and émotions. The characters dealt with here are among others the lotus, the bee, the sandal tree and the cloud，the parrot etc. J. Vacek as he himself puts it “discusses occurrences of attributive formulas connected with the désignation of jasmine (mullai)，their formal and semantic aspects". He présents a clear-cut analysis based on a rieh collection of paradigms. His conclusions and suggestions for fortheoming research are striking. Eva Wilden tackles the général picture of the Sangam symbolical code taking as an ex ample the anthropomorphic nature. To sum up, the volumes under review give a fresh impetus to Indian literary studies. They truly reflect the problems of the application of literary theory or théories taken from other dis ciplines of humanistic studies. Notwithstanding they truly show that one cannot proeeed in such studies without sound linguistic and philologi cal basis. I only wish that the Pandanus Work shop may involve more spécialiste who will continue this line of research. Gyula Wojtilla</page></plain_text>
