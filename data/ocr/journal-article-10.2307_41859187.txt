'Fab (the Fash trade Mini Pop' magazine dresses on a group of and the of catsuits British up-and-coming textile by Mary in- dustry) ran a feature called 'Fab Fash Pop' on a group of up-and-coming young British fashion designers. Mini dresses and catsuits by Mary Quant, Foale &amp; Tuffin, Jean Muir and Emmanuelle Khan were modelled against the backdrop of an exhibition by the American artist Robert Rauschenberg at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. The article celebrated the revo- lution in British fashion, and the triumph of youth-orientated 'ready-to-wear' on the international market. 'Fab Fash Pop' suggested that this new-found confidence in British fashion was closely allied to the success of British Pop. During the early 1960s British design, like British fashion and music, was infused with a new spirit of energy and enthusiasm, manifested in a wave of dynamic creativity and the emergence of a distinctive Pop and fashion-linked aesthetic. Furniture, furnishings and domestic products all flowered during this period. The booming economy and the upbeat mood of the nation's youth, symbolised by Carnaby Street, fed directly into the design of everyday goods. The designers who led this push had mostly trained during the early to mid 1950s - many at the Royal College of Art - and were still at an early stage in their careers. Full of enthusiasm, they embraced the commercial and creative opportunities that were opening up as Britain's economy bounced back after the war. Just as, in describing developments during the late 1940s and early 1950s, a phrase derived from French haute couture - 'The New Look' introduced by Christian Dior - sums up the character of the new post-war style, so during the early 1960s, a phrase originating from British fashion - 'the look' pioneered by Mary Quant - defines the revolution in outlook and aesthetics. The choice of lower case typography is significant, denoting informality and a break with tra- dition. It confirms the crucial shift away from high style - by implication expensive and adult - to more casual, youthful, affordable and democratic styles of design directed at the mass market. The 1960s was a much more complex decade in design terms than the 1950s, with several apparently conflicting things happening concurrently or in rapid succession. After the Second World War architects and designers from as far afield as Italy, Scandinavia, the United States and Britain seemed to converge in their creative thinking, and the relaxed but visually stimulating 'Contempo- rary' style came spontaneously into being. From the late 1940s onwards, and throughout the ensuing decade, 'Contemporary' - a self-consciously modern aesthetic which combined elements of Modernism with expressive form and decoration - became the shared international language of architects and de- signers, acting as a unifying force at such diverse events as the Festival of Brit- ain, the Milan Triennales and the Brussels Expo. But if the 1950s are remarkable for their coherence and convergence, the opposite is true of the 1960s, the latter part of which was characterised by di- vergence and fragmentation. Just as, during the 1950s, the design climate was strongly influenced by circumstances in the wider world - the sudden out- Figure 1. Studio coffee pot designed by Tom Arnold for J. &amp; G. Meakin, featuring Aztec pattern, 1964 19</page><page sequence="3">TWENTIETH CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 6 pouring of pent-up creativity after almost a decade of frustration and restraint during the war - so developments in design during the late 1960s parallel the widespread civil unrest of the period - the protests of the world's youth against the oppressive forces of the establishment. However, this article focuses on the calm before the storm, the surge of creativity in Britain during the early years of the decade before dissolution and disillusion set in. This period was just as revolutionary as the late 1960s, but at this stage radicalism was expressed in positive, creative terms, rather than through dissent. On an international level the supreme design superpower of the 1960s was Italy. It was in Italy that the full potential of plastics - the ultimate Space Age material - was exploited most comprehensively. Drawing on a range of hard and soft plastics, the Italians realised in sculptural form what designers in most other countries could only dream of. It was in Italy, too, that many of the most potent new technological and ideological concepts about design were formu- lated, embodied in the remarkable furniture of loe Colombo, the multifarious proto-Post-Modernist activities of Ettore Sottsass, and the radical insurgence of avant-garde groups such as Superstudio and Archizoom. What the Italians formulated during the 1960s was not just an updated version of 'Contempo- rary', but a 'New Domestic Landscape'; hence the title of a landmark exhibition held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1972, marking the culmina- tion of a decade of creative ferment. However, the Italian design explosion of the 1960s is not the subject of this article, which focuses instead on the crystallisation of a new design aesthetic in Britain, and the characteristics of that style. According to my calculations, 'the look' arrived in Britain around 1962, neatly coinciding with The Beatles. This was the year that Robin Day began developing his ground-breaking polypropylene chair for Hille, a robust, utilitarian, low- cost, multi-functional people's chair, the first in the world to use injection- moulded polypropylene for the shell of a seat. Polypropylene, which is light, supple and extremely durable, marked a significant advance on fibreglass (or more correctly, ther- mosetting resin reinforced with fibreglass), the rather brittle and heavy mate- rial used by Charles Eames for his pioneering moulded shell chair the previous decade. By harnessing the hitherto untapped potential of polypropylene, Robin Day liberated low- cost furniture production, and his achievements won him international acclaim and recognition. Trained at the rca during the mid 1930s, Robin Day's career as a furniture designer had had to be put on hold during the war. In 1948, however, he and Clive Latimer won the International Low-Cost Furniture Competition organ- ised by the Museum of Modern Art for an innovative range of moulded ply- wood storage cabinets. Day was subsequently awarded a high profile contract to design the seating for the Royal Festival Hall, and his career in Britain flour- ished from this date onwards after he teamed up with the supportive firm, Hille. Moulded plywood shells supported by steel rod legs formed the basis of his early chair designs, which were gently sculptural and organic in aesthetic. Because these materials were so strong, it meant that they could be used in thin layers and narrow gauges, giving a light, sprightly appearance to Day's designs. Although he absorbed stylistic influences from the United States and Denmark, Day was never one for unnecessary visual flourishes, and it was his disciplined, economical approach that distinguished his designs. One of the advantages of using polypropylene in place of moulded plywood was that it allowed for much greater subtlety in shaping the profile of the seat. Technologically Day's design marked a huge step forward, because the moulded plastic seat was strong enough not to require additional reinforce- ments, and the metal legs could be screwed directly into the underside of the shell. Launched in 1964, the polypropylene chair has remained in continuous production right up to the present day. Within a short space of time, it began 20</page><page sequence="4">spawning look-alikes - always a sure sign of a successful design - notably in a copycat version produced by pel. Advertisements for the polypropylene chair, and the innumerable later variants that Day subsequently developed for Hille, continued to appear in architecture and design magazines for the remainder of the decade, and it was often cited as an example of Pop design. The adop- tion of plastics paved the way for bold experimentation with colour, and the polypropylene chair was originally produced in three colours, including an orange-red called flame. Unlike some of the more ambitious but ephemeral furniture experiments of the period, the polypropylene chair has lasted, both physically and stylistically. In fact it has proved to be virtually indestructible, a rare claim for any piece of furniture, especially one from the post-war period. Although it is for his plastic chairs that Robin Day is best known, he contin- ued to design in wood throughout the 1960s, a material to which he remained lastingly committed. His teak dining chairs and tables for the newly built Churchill College, Cambridge (1964)» provide a good example of the robust, rectilinear structures and rich dark colours that he favoured in this medium, an aesthetic evolved to complement the forms and textures of contemporary ar- chitecture. Robin Day's dual interest in brightly coloured, sculptural, plastic forms, and chunky, block-like, wooden shapes, reflects the dichotomy in 'the look' of British furniture during early 1960s. Space Age shapes and materials were only one side of the coin. One place where these two complementary aesthetics were actively pro- moted side by side was Habitat, the youth-orientated furniture and furnish- ings store established by Terence Conran in 1964. It was Conran's experience as a textile and furniture designer and manufacturer during the 1950s that eventually prompted him to establish his own retail outlet, which rapidly took off and grew into a chain. He sensed the growing interest amongst the young in all aspects of modern design, not just fashion. Habitat ensured that his FAB FASH POP - 'THE LOOK' OF BRITISH DESIGN DURING THE EARLY 1960S Figure 2.

Advertisement for Fine tableware designed by Roy Midwinter and David Queensberry for Midwinter, 1961, featuring Queensberry Stripe pattern designed by David Queensberry, 1962 products - and others in a similar vein - reached their target market. It was all part of the process of the démocratisation of design. If the polypropylene chair was embraced as the people's chair and Habitat was adopted as the people's shop, then the people's pots were the tall cylindri- cal tablewares of Midwinter, Meakin, Portmeirion and Denby. Midwinter's Fine range, co-designed by Roy Midwinter and David Queensberry, became an instant success as soon as it appeared on the market in 1962. With its can- shaped vessel forms and crisply detailed patterns, Fine marked a significant departure from the sweeping curvilinear shapes and fluid patterns of Midwin- ter's Fashion range of 1955. Although produced in low-cost, low-fired earthen- ware, the body of Fine was so white and thin that it resembled expensive, high-fired porcelain. The range was also distinguished by the use of overglaze- enamel printed patterns, instead of hand-painted underglaze decoration, which gave the pots a more sophisticated and polished appearance. Susan Williams-Ellis's teeteringly tall, narrow, cylindrical Totem coffee pot (1962) for Portmeirion Pottery with its spindly handles and spouts, and Gill Pemberton's robust stoneware Chevron tableware (1963) for Denby, were also a resounding success during the early 1960s. Although different in colour, texture and weight, both were decorated with precise geometric motifs, and combined relief-textured patterns with monochrome glazes. Attenuated tube-shaped vessels such as these - the ceramic equivalent of Twiggy in a Mary Quant shift dress - typified 'the look' of 1960s tableware. As it turned out, such tall pots proved rather impractical to use. But J. &amp;&lt;j. Meakin came up with the ideal solution, their elegant but practical Studio range (c.1964) designed by Tom Arnold. Its shape was a toned down version of Portmeirion's Totem, and its patterns similar in style to those on Midwinter's Fine, David Queensberry, who played a key role in developing 'the look' of 1960s tableware, had been appointed Professor of Ceramics and Glass at the rca in 1959. In addition to Midwinter, he also helped to update the image of several other firms during the 1960s. His strikingly modern range of cut glass vases and bowls for Webb Corbett, in which straight-sided cylindrical vessel shapes were decorated with diamond, grid and circle patterns, was a worthy recipient of the Design Council's Duke of Edinburgh Award for Elegant Design in 1964. Fashion was moving at such a rapid rate during the 1960s that manufactur- ers had to keep on their toes to stay on top of the market. Whitefriars Glass, a perennially forward-looking company, updated its products on a regular basis throughout the decade to reflect the evolution of 'the look'. During the 1950s Whitefriars had followed the Scandinavian model, producing thick-walled, freeform vessels that exploited the plasticity of molten glass. In 1962, however, Geoffrey Baxter, the younger of Whitefriars' two designers, initiated a change of tack. Co-opting turn mould-blowing techniques previously reserved for pro- ducing lampshades, Baxter designed a range of thin-walled vases produced in dark inky colours such as midnight blue and shadow green. These pieces, with their clean-lined angular shapes, were succeeded in turn by the so-called Knobbly Range (1964) designed by William Wilson, which combined streaky colours with irregular forms and lumpy surface effects. The runaway success of the decade, however, was Geoffrey Baxter's Textured Range (1967), a collec- tion of deliberately ungainly mould-blown vessels with coarse bark and wood patterned surfaces. Produced initially in subtle cinnamon, willow and indigo, they looked even more remarkable in their later psychedelic guise of tangerine and kingfisher blue. Another area of British design in which textured effects were explored dur- ing the 1960s, along with cylindrical and angular shapes, was metalwork, which underwent a transformation comparable to that of ceramics and glass. The decade was dominated by a trio of talented silversmiths - Robert Welch, Gerald Benney and David Mellor - who had all trained together at the rca 22</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5. Textured ¿tange designed by Geoffrey Baxter for Whitefriars Glass, 1967, shown here in tangerine, introduced 1969 during the early 1950s. All three created remarkable one-off commissions in silver, as well as tackling production designs in newly fashionable and afford- able stainless steel. During the 1950s they had all been influenced to a large degree by the Scandinavian Modern style, especially the anthropomorphic vessels and jewellery of the Danish sculptor-designer Henning Koppel for Georg Jensen. By the early 1960s, however, they had cast off these seductive Nordic influences and were developing a distinctively British idiom with its own unique character and styling. Robert Welch's satin-finished stainless steel Alveston tableware and acces- sories (1962), produced by Old Hall, had drum-shaped bodies tapered at the shoulder and foot. Welch later expanded his design repertoire to encompass a much more unlikely material, cast iron, scoring a great popular success with his chunky cast iron candlesticks, composed of a series of stacked discs. The cross-fertilisation between different media characteristic of the period is re- flected in Ronald Stennett-Willson's Sheringham Candlesticks (1967) for King's Lynn Glass, which echo Welch's multi-flanged candlestick shape. David Mellor, as well as diversifying into product design, developed a series of stylish but functional cutlery ranges, notably Thrift (1965) for the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Gerald Benney, whilst actively pursuing his career as a 23</page><page sequence="7">TWENTIETH CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 6 silversmith, also teamed up with a leading Sheffield manufacturer, Viners, for whom he designed a series of cutlery ranges with distinctive textured handles. Scandinavian designers, as well as excelling in metalwork, had also distin- guished themselves in the field of lighting during the 1950s. Their influence, along with that of the American designer George Nelson, was strongly felt in Britain during the early post-war years. At this date the organic impulse was all pervasive, and lampshades were characterised by bubble shapes and tulip forms. During the 1960s, however, a more restrained and disciplined aesthetic emerged. Domed, drum-shaped and tubular forms characterised 'the look' of British lighting, and visual correspondences with ceramics, glass and metal- Figure 6. Advertisement for pendant light fittings by Merchant Adventurers, September 1966 Figure 7. Advertisement for pendant light fittings by Atlas Lighting, September 1963 work were particularly strong. Firms such as Merchant Adventurers and Atlas Lighting took the lead in developing this new vocabulary, carefully conceived to enhance the appearance of modern buildings. The resulting products were models of efficiency and elegance, with their understated engineering and sophisticated minimalist shapes. Moving on to other areas of furnishings, the 1960s was a remarkably fruit- ful period for British textile and wallpaper design. Heal Fabrics, who had domi- nated the 1950s with their adventurous printed patterns, became even more ambitious the following decade. As well as continuing to work with Lucienne Day, who had played such a decisive role in releasing the creative Zeitgeist after the war, they also produced printed furnishing fabrics by a host of other young designers, many fresh out of college. Lucienne Day pioneered a more architec- tural approach to pattern at the start of the 1960s through a series of forceful, large-scale, vertical designs structured in two halves. Bold, textural abstraction, as seen in Cadenza, replaced her earlier dancing linear style. Later designs became simpler and flatter, electrified by scintillating colour. Pre-eminent amongst the rising stars at Heal Fabrics was Barbara Brown, who tapped into the emergent Op Art aesthetic. Brown created a series of ar- resting abstract geometric patterns such as Piazza, exploiting a dynamic vo- cabulary of circles, stripes and squares, often printed in a palette of blue and brown or black and white. Gone were the quirky, playful Miróesque fantasies of the 1950s. Vigorous, painterly, abstract expressionism, created under the 24</page><page sequence="8">Figure 8.

Advertisement for Impact screen-printed cotton furnishing fabric designed by Evelyn Brooks for Heal Fabrics, April 1966 spell of Jackson Pollock, was also on its way out by 1962. The mood, although still energetic and upbeat, suddenly turned serious, as designers vied to create gigantic, hard-edged, geometric patterns for the large picture windows of schools and foyers. Countering all this earnestness was the lure of Carnaby Street, which triggered off an avalanche of dazzling Op patterns and riotous flat floral designs. Along with Heal Fabrics, another major player in the field of printed fur- nishing fabrics during the 1960s was the smaller firm of Hull Traders. Estab- lished in 1957, Hull Traders was strongly allied with the contemporary art world, initially through its relationship with Eduardo Paolozzi and Nigel Henderson. The appointment of Shirley Craven as chief designer and art direc- tor in i960 heralded a decade of outstanding innovation. Over the next ten years the company produced a series of uncompromisingly original designs. Craven's Division, which combined geometric abstraction with painterly free- dom, won a Design Centre Award in 1964. Her designs were distinguished not only by their imaginative compositions, but their unusual colour combina- tions. British wallpaper design was also on a high at the start of the 1960s. The renowned Palladio range, first introduced by the Wall Paper Manufacturers (wpm) in 1955» continued to evolve in interesting ways throughout the 1960s, in spite of the enforced break-up of the wpm by the Monopolies Commission. Designed specifically for architects, the Palladio collections showcased ambitious, large-scale patterns in a range of modern styles. In i960 the Palladio range was still being produced by the Lightbown Aspinall branch of the wpm, with art direction by Roger Nicholson. Production was later transferred to Sanderson, and artistic control passed to the wpm 's newly established Central Design Studio, initially run by Deryck Healey, subsequently by Edward Pond. This accounts for the stylistic evolution of the Palladio collections over the course of the decade. They started out as a vehicle for designers of painterly and architectural persuasions, but later reflected diverse fashions, including Op, Pop and Flower Power. Throughout the 1960s there were interesting parallels between the career of The Beatles and the development of British design. The Beatles were a product 25</page><page sequence="9">TWENTIETH CENTURY ARCHITECTURE 6 of the 1950s, shaped by American Rhythm and Blues, and Rock n' Roll, but with a distinctive British identity of their own. They recorded their first single in 1962, and achieved success from 1963 onwards, celebrated both for their music and their 'look' (neat collarless suits and shaggy mop tops). During the mid 1960s they went from strength to strength musically, although by 1965 - the year of Help!- the pressure of fame was beginning to tell. From this date on- wards they began to explore new avenues and develop their talents as indi- viduals, which ultimately led to the fragmentation and break-up of the group. Similarly, 'the look' of British design in the 1960s grew out of developments during the 1950s, incorporating various stylistic influences absorbed from abroad. Crystallising around 1962, it rapidly grew in confidence, reaching a high point during the mid 1960s at the time when British pop music and Carnaby Street fashions swept the world. The title of The Ambassadoť s 1964 feature, 'Fab Fash Pop', sums up the frenetic excitement of the period in mu- sic, fashion and design, a time of great focus, drive and creative energy. Towards the end of the decade design became more eclectic and fragmented. As designers turned increasingly to historical and ethnic sources for inspiration, the intensity of the Swinging Sixties ebbed away. 26</page></plain_text>
