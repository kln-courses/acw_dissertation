<plain_text><page sequence="1">RAIMO TUOMELA CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION* I. EVENTS AND SINGULAR CAUSAL CLAIMS According to the backing law account of causation a singular causal claim is to be analyzed (or "justified") by reference to a suitable nomic theory which, together with the given singular statement describing a cause, deductively supports or explains the statement describing the effect. This backing law (or deductive-nomological) account of singular causation has recently become the target of several kinds of criticism. First, the possibility of giving a detailed and elaborate account of the required nomic or explanatory backing has been doubted. Secondly, it has been claimed that the deductive-nomological account is bound to lead to unacceptable ontological difficulties (see Kim [1969] and [1973a]). Thirdly, it has been argued that the backing law account fails to give a satisfactory analysis of certain conditional or counterfactual aspects of causation (see Lewis [1973b]). Fourthly, it has been claimed that this approach does not work at least within the social and historical sciences as there are no laws and theories of the required sort to be found there. In this paper I shall try to constructively defend the backing theory account of scientific causation against some of the mentioned criticisms. More specifically, I shall be concerned with the second and third type of criticisms (see, e.g. Tuomela [1972] and [1974b] for an attempt to deal with the first and the second). There has been much disagreement concerning which kind of onto- logical entities causes and effects are. Thus, are they extralinguistic en- tities such as events, states, conditions, etc., or are they rather linguistic (or semilinguistic) entities such as propositions or facts, etc.? Without further justification, we shall below assume that it is primarily events (broadly understood so as to include short-term states and conditions) which in the first place qualify as causes and effects in scientific contexts. Mackie (1974) makes a distinction between productive and explanatory causes (also see Davidson [1967]). This distinction seems to correspond R. S. Cohen et al. (eds.), PSA 1974, 325-360.

More specifically, for Mackie (1974) events qualify as productive causes whereas facts (which involve occurrence of an event) qualify as explanatory causes. We shall later see that there is in fact a closer correspondence between productive causes and explanatory causes than has been thought, provided that events are construed as structured, and not bare, particulars. In the view to be accepted in Sections III-VI below an event consists of a locusobject, a point of time, and a generic property exemplified by the locus object (cf. Kim [1973a]). The property in question can be called the aspect property (or the constitutive property) of the event. To take a simple monadic example, the event of Socrates' drinking hemlock at time t is represented by &lt;&lt;Socrates, t&gt;, drinks hemlock&gt;, or, more for- mally, by &lt;&lt;x, t&gt;, P&gt;. The property P is the aspect or constitutive prop- erty of this event. On the other hand, this event is said to merely exem- plify the property of consuming poison, say Q, which is not constitutive of the event of Socrates' drinking hemlock at t. The identity condition for monadic events now may be construed as follows: &lt;&lt;x, t&gt;, P&gt; = =&lt;&lt;y, t'&gt;, Q&gt; if and only if x=y, t=t', and P=Q. As in our above ex- ample PA Q, the events in question are deemed different.' The second hard problem in discussing the ontology of causality is this: What kind of statements qualify as event-descriptions ? If we want to make sense of locutions like a 'redescription of an event' this problem has to be solved. Davidson has argued (partly on the basis of a para- doxical result discussed in the next section) that the attempt to charac- terize event-describing statements is futile and that (singular) events should rather be referred to by nominalizing verb phrases (singular terms) (see e.g. Davidson [1969]). Many ordinary language statements which may seem to describe particular events are on a closer look existential. Thus, for example, the correct logical form of the action sentence 'Shem kicked Shaun' is not, according to Davidson, given by anything like 'Kicked (Shem, Shaun)', which sentence is based on a two-place pred- icate, but rather by '(Ex) Kicked (Shem, Shaun, x)', which is based on a three place predicate incorporating the variable x for singular events. According to Davidson's suggestion, if a kicking of Shaun by Shem oc- curred at midnight this is taken care of simply by '(Ex) (Kicked [Shem, Shaun, x] &amp; At midnight [x])'. But what if this kicking was intense? If</page><page sequence="3">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 327 we add the conjunct 'Intense (x)' we are saying that the event was intense whereas what we wanted to do was to modify the verb 'kicked'. How- ever, it seems that problems like this can be handled, and attempts to develop a theory of verb-modification have been made. Therefore the Davidsonian framework seems to us acceptable provided the structured nature of events can properly be accounted for. Singular events are referred to and picked out by singular terms of the scientific language employed. Therefore we may employ singular causal claims such as: e caused e'. Here e names the singular event e and e' names e'. But singular causal claims like this do not display the structure of events and hence not the generic properties in virtue of which the singular events can be shown to be causes or effects. The justification of causal claims is to be made by reference to a backing theory, which in our view is best formulated linguistically. It follows that we need event- describing statements. Of their form and nature we can here say at least the following. Given an event e = &lt;&lt;x, t&gt;, P&gt; in most cases of interest the property P can be designated by a predicate P in our scientific language. Then the occurrence of e can be represented linguistically by 'P(e) &amp; (Ex) (x = e)'. (It is not necessary here to consider linguistically the locus and the time of the occurrence of e.) The true statement 'P(e)' is a constitutive state- ment for e, and it may be considered (in a sense) analytically true of e (see Tuomela [1974b]). Notice, however, that the backing theory need not contain P at all as the subsumption can be effected by reference to other predicates true of e. If what I just said can be accepted it seems that we may move from a singular causal statement like 'e caused e" or 'e is a cause of e" to a corresponding linguistic formulation of the type 'That e has P caused that e' has Q' without affecting at least the truth of our singular causal claims. Thus we seem to be able to go back and forth between onto- logical or material talk and linguistic fact-talk. But there are troubles here. First, we may not know under which pred- icates e and e' are causally related even if we may have reasons for claim- ing that e caused e'. Secondly, the linguistic formulation must be taken to entail the truth of both the antecedent and the consequent, I think. But then it is immediately seen to be non-truth-functional (switching antecedent and consequent does not preserve the truth of the causal</page><page sequence="4">328 RAIMO TUOMELA claim). If 'caused' then represents a non-truth-functional conditional what could its logical form be? We shall discuss this problem below in Section VI after a digression into some ontological and other issues involved in the analysis of singular causal claims. II. ONTOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES CONNECTED WITH CAUSAL STATEMENTS Let us now consider a certain analysis of singular causal claims. It is the most sophisticated version of those discussed and criticized in Kim (1969). For the purposes of this section we consider a purely extensional set- theoretic construal of events (thus aspect properties become sets and relations). This causal analysis can be formulated as follows: (C) Event e is a cause of event e' if and only if there are singular statements D and D' such that D and D' describe e and e' respectively, and D' is a logical consequence of D together with some causal law S but not of D alone. It may seem initially plausible to assume that event-describing state- ments are referentially transparent and that the class of event-describing statements is closed with respect to logical deduction. This amounts to accepting the following two innocent looking principles (cf. Kim [1969], pp. 206-207): (I) If a statement D' is obtained from a statement D by replacing some referring expression in D by a co-referential expression, then D and D' describe the same event. (L) If a statement D entails another statement D' the event de- scribed by D is said to include the event described by D'. As an immediate corollary of (L) we then have (L') Logically equivalent statements describe the same event. But the acceptance of these principles leads to the result that singular causal statements are truth-functional, after all. Hence we get an "onto- logical" paradox. This well known paradox has many faces, but we shall be mainly interested in the following version of it: Any cause can be de- scribed by means of any arbitrary true event-describing statement, and</page><page sequence="5">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 329 any effect can be described by means of any arbitrary true event-de- scribing statement. (See, e.g. Mackie [1974] and Tuomela [1974a] for a detailed discussion of this result.) Quite analogously one can show that any law that (C)-subsumes at least one pair of events (C)-subsumes every pair. Our above paradox can in fact be "ontologically" strengthened if we, in accordance with our earlier considerations, require that singular causal statements entail the existence of the cause-event and the effect-event. For then we get the following result: If an event e causes an event e' then e causes any arbitrary event e" and e' is caused by any arbitrary event e". Obviously something is deeply wrong with our referential apparatus, but what ? Recall that we were discussing some singular statements which were supposed to be event-describing. But it is by no means clear that such singular statements, not even those we have been considering, are event-describing. Thus, even if we may plausibly assume that we start in (C) with some event-describing statements there is no guarantee that the application of conditions (I) and (L) always yields event-describing statements. One may now suspect that the class of event-describing statements is not closed under logical deduction, and that hence (L) is not acceptable for this reason. Similarly one may have doubts concerning (I) in the case of predicative expressions (e.g. 'the tallest man in this room') as compared with genuine referring expressions (e.g. 'John') in this con- dition (cf. Kim [1969] and Mackie [1974]). I mainly agree with such doubts and critical remarks concerning (I) and (L). But below I shall concentrate on different aspects of the situation. However, some philosophers see no fault in these conditions. Thus, Davidson (1967), for one, considers (I) and (L) (or at least (L'), if that matters) and hence the resulting paradoxical theorem, acceptable. But as he on the other hand admits that causal statements are non-truth- functional, he goes on to conclude that causal connections between events cannot be described by means of singular statements, but that rather it has to be done by means of a two-place causal predicate. For the reason mentioned earlier, and for some additional reasons related to partial causation (see e.g. Davidson [1967], pp. 698-699), I have accepted this conclusion even if I do not accept Davidson's main reason (i.e. that singular causal claims treated by means of statements are "shown" to</page><page sequence="6">330 RAIMO TUOMELA be both truth-functional and non-truth-functional, which "result" then is considered absurd). My approach to solving the ontological paradox expressed basically consists of the rejection of condition (C). But, taken in conjunction with some plausible semantical assumptions, it also follows that at least con- dition (L) will have to be rejected. (See Tuomela (1 974a) for an argument concerning this and for a broader discussion concerning "ontological" paradoxes.) We may notice here that our rejection of (I) and (L) means that at least the linguistic notion of eventhood is to be construed as an intensional (i.e. non-transparent and ultra-intensional) notion. This of course fits well together with the analysis of events sketched in Section I. III. CAUSALITY AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION We shall below analyze causality in terms of nomological causal expla- nation, and this requires some modifications in (C). Now I consequently suggest that nomic backing is to be considered equivalent to explanatory backing. Speaking in general philosophical terms, I here understand ex- planation simply as an argument providing reasons for the truth of the explanandum (see e.g. Tuomela [1973], Chapter VII for my underlying intuitive ideas). Let us now write C(e, e') for 'e was a cause of e' or 'e caused e''. Instead of (C), I then propose the following principle as our new starting point: (C*) C(e, e') is true only if there are singular statements D and D' such that D and D' describe e and e' respectively, and there is a causal law (or theory) S which jointly with D deductively explains D' (but D alone does not explain D'). Condition (C*) gives a necessary condition for the truth of the causal predicate C(e, e'). To give a sufficient condition as well we have to add some conditions. We shall soon discuss these additional conditions as well as what is required of the causal theory S as to its form and content (to e.g. avoid the apparent circularity in (C*)). To clarify my new proposal (C*) I shall start by sketching the account of the logical (i.e. deductive-inferential) aspects of deductive explanation I have in mind for (C*).2</page><page sequence="7">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 331 One central requirement for deductive explanations is that they should not be more circular than is "necessary." (Of course there must be some common content between the explanans and the explanandum; other- wise there could not be a deductive relationship between them.) As recent discussion on explanation has shown, the following kind of general con- dition has to be accepted: In an explanation the components of the ex- planans and the explanandum should be noncomparable. We say that two components or statements P and Q are noncomparable exactly when not F P-* Q and not F QU-P. (See e.g. Ackermann [1965] and Tuomela [1972] for a discussion leading to the acceptance of this general con- dition.) Actually our analysis of noncomparability needs some refine- ment, mainly because of the vagueness of the notion of a component. To accomplish this we use the technical notions of a sequence of truth- functional components of an explanans and of a set of ultimate sentential conjuncts of an explanans (cf. Ackermann and Stenner [1966]). A sequence of statemental well formed formulas &lt; W1, W2,..., W,&gt; of a scientific language Y is a sequence of truth-functional components of an explanans (theory) T if and only if T may be built up from the se- quence by the formation rules of A, such that each member of the se- quence is used exactly once in the application of the rules in question. The WH's are thus to be construed as tokens. The formation rules of Y naturally have to be specified in order to see the exact meaning of the notion of a sequence of truth-functional components of a theory finitely axiomatized by a sentence T. A set of ultimate sentential conjuncts Tc of a sentence T is any set whose members are the well formed formulas of the longest sequence &lt; W1, W2,..., W,&gt; of truth functional components of T such that T and W1 &amp; W2 &amp; ... &amp; W, are logically equivalent. If T is a set of sentences then the set Tc of ultimate conjuncts of T is the union of the sets of ultimate sentential conjuncts of each member of T. We may notice here that although by definition the Tc-sets of two logically equiv- alent theories are logically equivalent they need not be the same. (Also notice that there are in principle no restrictions which would exclude e.g. the use of a causal or nomic implication in Y.) Now we are ready to state a better version of the noncomparability requirement for a Tc of a theory Tconstituting an explanans (cf. Tuomela [1976]): For any Tcj in the largest set of truth-functional components of T, Tcj is noncomparable with the explanandum.</page><page sequence="8">332 RAIMO TUOMELA In addition to this condition we require that the explanans and the explanandum of an explanation are consistent, that the explanans log- ically implies the explanandum, and that the explanans contains some universal laws. Finally, there is a nontrivial logical condition for our explanation re- lation, call it E, which condition guarantees that an explanans provides a proper amount of relevant information. This is condition (5) below. (The reader is referred to Tuomela [1972] and [1976] for a discussion of its acceptability.) Now we can state the basic logical conditions of our model of explanation (termed the weak DEL-model in Tuomela [1972]). Let T be a statement, Tc a set of ultimate sentential components of T (or actually a conjunction of components in the context E(L, Tc)), and L a statement to be explained. Then we say that the relation E (L, Tc) satisfies the logico-inferential conditions of adequacy for the deductive explanation of (singular or general) scientific statements if and only if (1) {L, Tc} is consistent; (2) Tcl-L; (3) Tc contains at least some universal statements; (4) for any Tci in the largest set of truth-functional components of T, Tci is noncomparable with L; (5) it is not possible, without contradicting any of the previous conditions for explanation, to find sentences Si,..., Sr (r &gt; 1) at least some of which are essentially universal such that for some Tcj,..., Tc, (n&gt;1): Tci &amp; .. . &amp; TCn Si &amp; ...&amp; Sr not Si &amp; ...&amp; Sr k Tcj &amp; ... &amp; Tcn TCS F L, where TcS is the result of the replacement of Tci,..., Tcn by Si,..., Sr in Tc, and '1-' means 'deducible by means of pred- icate logic but not by means of universal or existential in- stantiation only'. Condition (5) is not quite unambiguously formulated as it stands. The reader is referred to Tuomela (1976) for its clarification (note especially conditions (V) and (Q) discussed in that paper) and also for an alter- native interpretation of 'I-'. See Tuomela (1972) for a detailed discussion of the formal properties of the notion of explanation that this model</page><page sequence="9">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 333 generates. Here it must suffice to make the following general remarks only. In the above model of explanation an explanandum may have several explanantia differing in their quantificational strength (depth). On each quantificational level, however, only the weakest explanans-candidate qualifies. Our model thus generates an explanation-tree for each ex- planandum such that the explanantia in different branches may be in- compatible whereas the explanantia within the same branches are com- patible and increasingly stronger.3 More exactly the weak DEL-model has the following central logical properties (see Tuomela [1972]): (a) E(L, Tc) is not reflexive. (b) E(L, Tc) is not symmetric. (c) E(L, Tc) is not transitive. (d) If E(L, Tc) and if, for some Tc', Tc'Tc (assuming not EpTc'-+Tc), then E(L,Tc'), provided every Tc'e Tc is non- comparable with L. (e) E(L, Tc) is not invariant with respect to the substitution of either materially or logically equivalent explanantia nor ex- plananda. (f) E(L, Tc) and if, for some T' such that F T_ T', T and T' possess identical sets of ultimate sentential components (i.e. Tc = Tc'), then E(L, Tc'). (g) If E(L, Tc) and for some L', L = L' * then E(L', Tc), provided that for all Tci in Tc, Tci and L' are noncomparable. (h) If E(L, Tc) and E(L, Tc'), then it is possible that Tc and Tc' (and hence the corresponding theories T and T') are mutually (logically) incompatible. What interests us especially much in this context is the property (e). The lack of linguistic invariance exhibited by it shows or expresses the fact that explanation is a pragmatic notion: How you state your deduc- tive argument may make a great difference concerning the explanatory value of the argument. Whether an argument is an explanation should prima facie be decided on its own right, so to speak, and not indirectly on the basis of its having been somehow derived from another acceptable explanatory argument.</page><page sequence="10">334 RAIMO TUOMELA This is the case in our model of explanation. If an argument satisfies our logical arguments it becomes a potential explanation. To qualify as a materially valid explanation still some other requirements have to be imposed, as is well known. For instance, the generalization (of theory) used in the explanans should be lawlike, which we take to entail that it contains only predicates expressing natural kinds. Furthermore, the ex- planhns and the explanandum should be acceptable as true, etc. Some of these further demands will concern the "pragmatic" features of the explainer and his scientific community. On the basis of some features, especially property (e) above, of our model it can be argued that the principle (L) is not acceptable. In ad- dition, some further assumptions concerning the semantical relationships between event-descriptions and events described are needed. That argu- ment is given in Tuomela (1974a) to which the reader is referred. In that paper also the case of composite events and the possibility for paradox free event descriptions in the light of our model for deductive explanation are considered. However, our main concern in this paper is to discuss some other aspects of causality to which we now turn. IV. THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF CAUSALITY Our scheme (C*) may be taken to express the main idea of the backing law theory. Still it leaves many aspects of this view unclarified. In ad- dition, (C*) totally ignores some central features of causality and fails to give a sufficient condition for the truth of the singular causal predicate C(e, e'). Let us now try to improve our analysis in some respects towards a fuller backing law account of causality. As we know, causal phrases like 'cause', 'effect', 'consequence', 'result', 'bringing about', 'producing' 'nomic necessitation', etc. are used in a great variety of ways both in ordinary and in scientific discourse. There- fore one may doubt whether one can say many things which are uni- versally applicable even to all notions of scientific causation (which is our topic). For instance, accepting the backing law idea, it seems that, depending on science, these backing laws may vary greatly as to their form and not only as to their substantive content. We shall, however, try to find some features which are common to causation, as discussed within science.</page><page sequence="11">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 335 Let us thus ask the following question: What does it mean to say that a singular event e was a cause of another singular event e'? We can broadly answer this question by saying that e produced e' (in those circumstances). However, producing is also a causal notion, and thus it may not seem to give much further elucidation of the notion of causation. But one may consider this producing-relationship also from a, so to speak, gen- eric point of view. Thus the producing-relationship exhibited by C(e, e') really involves a nomic correlation between two generic events which e and e' exemplify. Let us assume that e exemplifies the property P and e' the property Q. (P and Q do not necessarily have to be those aspect properties of e and e' with which we originally characterized these events.) So what is really involved here is that events of the kind P produce events of the kind Q. As we shall mostly be concerned with deterministic causa- tion here this means that under normal conditions every singular event of the kind P produces an event of the kind Q. Causal producing is thus primarily a relationship concerned with kinds of events. However, I think that at least when P and Q are aspect prop- erties of e and e' the nomic necessity involved in this generic production and necessitation is exhibited or "seen" also on the singular level be- tween e and e'. Thus C(e, e') also may have or acquire some reportive (evidential) uses. Scientists so to) speak internalize the rules of usage of the predicate C(e, e'), that is, the right hand side of (C*) or analogous account, and start applying it in thieir experiments as describing what is going on in singular event sequences. Thus the originally (i.e. from a conceptual point of view) purely metalinguistic predicate becomes a kind of theoretical predicate with possibly some direct evidential uses. Able and reliable scientists working within a certain scientific community learn to use the predicate C(e, e') closely analogously to how they learn to use such theoretical predicates as 'electron', 'radio star', or 'subconscious wish'. Thus they also learn to make statements like "Giving subject S a certain kind of electric shock caused the trembling of his left hand." It can be argued on the basis of examples like this that even singular causal statements can be taken to express a kind of necessity (see Mackie [1974], ch. 8). We shall later return into the "necessity" in singular causal processes. Let me here only notice two consequences of accepting this view. First, even if the predicate C(e, e') can sometimes be used for direct evidential reporting, it is not an observational predicate (in any strict</page><page sequence="12">336 RAIMO TUOMELA sense of 'observational'; see Tuomela [1973], ch. I). Instead it is highly theory-laden in the obvious sense of depending on a backing law or theory. Secondly, the acceptance of some kind of objective necessity to be exemplified even in singular causal processes clearly means the rejec- tion of a Humean (regularity) account of causality as Hume did not accept any objective necessity either on the level of singular or generic events. Any scientific theorizing seems to involve a "modelling" of reality in a way which involves idealization, schematization and some distortion of reality. The investigation of causal connections between objective events and processes serves as a good example of this. When a scientist studies a system's behavior he must somehow distinguish between the relevant and irrelevant aspects and properties of the objective situation. To use a commonly accepted phrase, he must construct a causal field. Such a causal field selects some features as possible causes and effects, whereas other aspects or properties are only "standing conditions" (pre- conditions) or are left out of consideration almost completely by in- cluding them into ceteris paribus conditions. I thus take the construction of a causal field to involve a pragmatic element which involves a depar- ture from the idea of a purely objective notion of productive causation (in something like the sense of Mackie [1974]). Another pragmatic element in the backing theory analysis comes into the picture in the formulation of theories. For the backing theories often employ predicates (concepts) which do not quite correctly represent the objective properties in the causal field; and these theories may be wrong in how they express relationships between the properties represented by these predicates. As the backing theory account justifies the truth of a singular causal claim by requiring an appropriate backing theory or "theory in work" to exist several difficulties are seen to be involved. Our condition (C*) quantifies existentially over theories, i.e. over the set of all possible theories containing predicates for the properties of the underlying causal field. But this set of theories need not be a well defined set at all, it seems. It cannot a priori be limited in any way for otherwise we may lose the "law of working" which represents the underlying objective causal pro- ducing relation. It should also be noticed that even if our model of (actual) explanation, and hence our (C*), requires the backing theory to be true,</page><page sequence="13">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 337 there may still be several theories characterizing the underlying causal process equally well and considered true with equally strong reasons. How can one choose the "correct" law or theory of working among these? The difficulties are still the more difficult as we cannot require in our (C*) that the backing theory somehow be algorithmically con- structible. (Notice that, ceteris paribus, to epistemically justify a singular causal claim it suffices to have enough evidence for the claim that there is a backing theory S.) We cannot either in principle require that the backing theory be finitely axiomatizable, although we shall, for simplic- ity, below proceed as if it were. I shall not here try to solve the raised difficulties point by point. Let it suffice to make the following two general remarks. First, as our dis- cussion has shown, even if some of the above problems could be solved it is very likely that some distortion will always remain in the knowledge our backing theory gives of the underlying causal process. (Perhaps in a mythical Peircean limiting science all these distortions disappear and producing causes and explanatory causes become identical. But to note this is about as helpful as to say that in the long run we are all dead.) Secondly, the above difficulties affect more or less any current account of explanation and confirmation (even if such an approach would not explicitly quantify over theories), so that we are all in that same big boat. Our schema (C*) for singular causation is rather incomplete as it states only some central necessary conditions for the truth of a singular claim. To make our analysis look more complete we shall now isolate some other aspects of causality. First, we are in this paper concerned with direct (as opposed to indirect or mediate) causation. I take this directness to be analyzable primarily in terms of spatiotemporal contiguity. Here, however, no attempt to analyze the content of this factor can be made (see e.g. Kim [1973a] for a good recent discussion of this Humean aspect of causality). Secondly, causes and effects are clearly asymmetric. But what is in- volved in this asymmetry? Time does not seem to be a definite condition for causal priority, as recent discussions have shown (see v. Wright [1971] and Mackie [1974]). Instead it would seem that causes somehow fix ef- fects in a way effects do not fix the occurrences of cause-events. Speaking in anthropomorphic terms, at least when causes are either sufficient or</page><page sequence="14">338 RAIMO TUOMELA necessary for events, by means of a cause-event one can either produce or, in the latter case, prevent an effect-event. It seems to us that a more objectivistic analysis in terms of fixity conditions may give a satisfactory account of causal priority. In this paper, in any case, we must omit a deeper analysis of this aspect of causality as well (except for a later com- ment on explanatory asymmetry in Section VI). Let us next consider a simple example. There was a fire in a house and an inspector looks for its cause. He notices that the fire had something to do with a defect in the electrical system: a short-circuit somewhere was at least a necessary condition for the occurrence of the fire. Other necessary conditions were that there was current in the wire and that there was inflammable material. Which of these, if any, is the cause of the fire ? It may be that it is true to say of the short-circuit, but not of the other two factors, that had the fire not occurred then the short-circuit had not occurred. If so, the short-circuit was in the above sense a counterfactu- ally sufficient condition of the fire whereas the other two factors are merely necessary conditions. This might be taken to justify to call the short-circuit the cause, ceteris paribus. The short-circuit represents a change in the causal field, whereas the other two factors are standing conditions (preconditions). This indicates that in a search for the cause it is of importance first to distinguish between potential causal factors and standing conditions. However, the distinction between the cause (or the total cause) and a cause (or standing condition, either) cannot always be made in terms of the above counterfactual sufficient conditionship criterion. Clearly, at least non-deterministic causes (e.g. radium atom's decay causing the oc- currence of a radon atom) do not satisfy the above criterion of sufficiency. In addition, there seem to be more homely examples within deterministic causation in which causes do not satisfy this kind of strong sufficiency condition (see Section V). An attempt to distinguish the cause from other causal determinants seems to essentially make reference to scientists' interests and "values" (involved in selecting "comparison situations" for "effect situations" and the like). Their consideration here would take us too far aside from our main concern, which is the analysis of direct productive causal de- terminants of events.</page><page sequence="15">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 339 V. A BACKING LAW ACCOUNT OF SINGULAR CAUSATION After this discussion concerning the isolation of the central features in- volved in singular causation we can complement our previous scheme (C*) by mentioning some new necessary conditions so that we obtain a set of conditions which are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for the truth of our singular causal predicate C(e, e'). The rest of our discussion will then be devoted to the elaboration of some special fea- tures of our scheme. As said earlier, I take 'e caused e" to mean the same as 'e produced e". An analysis of producing again brings into the picture the backing law. Thus a scheme like our earlier (C*) and our (C**) below can be regarded as a kind of meaning-explication, in terms of truth conditions, of C(e, e'). However, as was pointed out, the question is primarily of justifying the possible uses of the predicate C(e, e'), and such a justifica- tion also involves epistemological and metaphysical considerations (e.g. considerations of truth lawlikeness, and necessity) which transcend the boundaries of a strict meaning analysis. As I will be concerned with causality as a kind of determination, I will not be concerned with anything like probabilistic singular causation. But I do not assume the validity of any universal principle of determina- tion. Nor do I have to assume even that the backing law is deterministic, as the determination may be effected in part through some auxiliary as- sumptions and contextual information, and not merely through the backing law. We can now summarize our above discussion in terms of the following amended scheme where we let C(e, e') read 'e is a deterministic direct cause of e": (C**) The statement C(e, e') is true if and only if there are sin- gular statements D and D' such that D and D' describe the occurrence of e and e', respectively, and there is an applied causal theory S such that (1) S jointly with D gives an actual explanation of D' in the sense of the weak DEL-model, viz. there is a Tc for T = =S &amp;D such that E(D', Tc) in the sense of the weak DEL-model of explanation;</page><page sequence="16">340 RAIMO TUOMELA (2) e is causally prior to e'; (3) e is spatiotemporally contiguous with e'. There are several features in our scheme (C**) which need clarifica- tion and elaboration. To start, we assume that D and D' are true state- ments describing the occurrence of e and e', respectively. This is to be understood in the strong sense that D and D' contain rigid designators for these events. (Notice the difficulty this entails for creating a non- circular causal theory of reference.) Our constitutive statements discussed in Section I serve as examples for this kind of singular statements. The existence of such true statements D and D' guarantees the occurrence of the cause-event e and the effect-event e'. Thus the truth of a singular causal claim entails the occurrence of both the cause-event and the effect- event, which of course should be the case. Before discussing the nomic nature of the backing law S we still have to say something about the requirement of explanation (condition (1)). First, the explanans-theory S is said to be an applied theory. This means roughly that, in addition to a nomic core theory, S may contain general auxiliary assumptions as well as singular statements, which take into account contextual features of the explanatory situation (cf. Tuomela [1973]). The applied theory S cum D then explains D' in the sense of the weak DEL-model. (Notice that in this model of explanation the statement D cannot alone explain D', whence such a requirement would be superfluous.) It should be emphasized that the conditions (1)-(5) were taken to explicate those aspects of scientific explanation which have to do with explanation as a special kind of logical inference (argument). What we need here is a "full" account of actual explanation. Therefore, I propose that the relation E of explanation really should be taken to satisfy all the conditions of adequacy of Tuomela (1972) relevant to singular explanation. One such central additional condition is that the explanans and the explanandum should be accepted as true. At this point at the latest the reader may voice the objection that the analysis given by (C**) is circular as the word 'causal' occurs even twice in the analysans. But this objection can be avoided (to a great extent at least). First we recall that causal priority (condition (2)) was claimed to be analyzable in terms of objective fixity conditions, and hence without reference to causal notions. But the word 'causal' also occurs as an at-</page><page sequence="17">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 341 tribute of the backing theory S. Is this not fatal for our account ? It should be noticed to begin with that the backing theory does not contain the predicate C(e, e') nor its "counterpart" in the language of the backing theory, so that no strong circularity in this sense obtains. Furthermore, we do not attempt to give a reductionist analysis of causality at all. That would be a philosophical mistake. Notice also that a causal theory is something more than merely a nomic theory, for there are non-causal nomic theories (e.g. "The formation of the respiratory system in a human embryo always succeeds the formation of the circulatory system"). Thus causal laws cannot be analyzed entirely in terms of nomicity. Nagel gives as his paradigm example of a causal law: 'Whenever a spark passes through a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas, the gases disappear and water is formed' (Nagel [1961], p. 74). The defining con- ditions for such a causal law are in Nagel's analysis the following four. (1) The causal law expresses an invariable and uniform connection be- tween cause-events and effect-events. The cause-events and effect-events are (2) spatially and (3) temporally contiguous. (4) The generic causal relation is asymmetric. But it seems to me unnecessary to require that a backing causal law expresses spatial and temporal contiguity. Even Nagel's own example of a causal law does not (at least explicitly) take into account these features. In our (C**) these features are included in those conditions of causality which directly characterize singular cause- effect pairs. In other words, spatiotemporal contiguity has to be required only on the singular but not necessarily on the generic level. I shall not try here to present a uniform analysis for causal theory applicable to all sciences, for I believe there are hardly any such common articulated features of causal laws except for their nomicity. What a causal theory looks like depends on the particular science in question, and it may also depend on the paradigmatic values and beliefs held by the scientists of a given community. What does necessary connection between generic events amount to ? As any hard and difficult philosophical problem this matter can and has to be approached from various points of view. As we know the problem indeed has interesting logical, semantical, ontological, metaphysical, epistemological and pragmatic aspects. I can here only briefly touch on some of the involved features, and I do so only in order to put our anal- ysis of causation in a proper philosophical perspective.</page><page sequence="18">342 RAIMO TUOMELA One can claim that the necessity exemplified by pure causal "laws of working" is the persistence and (qualitative and structural) continuity to be found in objective causal processes (cf. Mackie [1974]). For instance, the uniform movement of a single particle, free from interference, would be an example of this. The above features clearly go beyond mere regular connection of events (in some Humean sense) and they may also be re- garded as transcending "mere" nomicity. Furthermore, such persistence and continuity can be claimed to be objectively present in any singular cause-effect connection as well (contrary to Hume). I would like to distinguish between the descriptive and the prescriptive sides of lawlikeness or lawhood. The descriptive aspects of a law or the- ory have to do with a statement or a piece of linguistic discourse de- scribing the world (or a certain idealized model of the world). The pre- scriptive aspect is concerned with the theory-users linguistic (and other) behavior (especially argumentation) and thus with the so-called prag- matic aspects of science. A scientific law may be considered to nomically connect two or more concepts (on the conceptual level) and thus to express a nomic connection holding between real properties or generic events. Thus we may come to express nomic laws by means of modal locutions like, e.g. 'Neces- sarily, if something a has property P then a has property Q'. What do such locutions mean? Modal logicians have recently been busy investi- gating causal necessity and have done much in clarifying the semantics of such necessity statements, and we shall discuss it in more detail later. One widely accepted criterion for nomicity is the support of "corre- sponding" counterfactual statements (e.g. 'If a had P, when in fact it does not, it would have Q'). This is certainly an important feature belonging to nomic theories. However, some remarks are due here. First, as soon as we have decided to call a statement nomically necessary it will auto- matically support counterfactual statements (at least) if e.g. Lewis' (1973a) or a related analysis is accepted. So on that analysis at least there is a conceptual connection between these two features. The problem then becomes in finding other criteria for calling a statement nomic. Thus I think the -meaning-problem is not so central in the case of lawlike state- ments, but rather the important and interesting problems lie in finding epistemological and metaphysical criteria for lawhood. One may now be interested in either the descriptive or the prescriptive</page><page sequence="19">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 343 dimensions of lawlikeness in looking for such criteria. As far as one is interested in laws merely as general descriptions of the world one should in principle be able to get along without modal necessities (be they de dicto or de re) and hence without tools for expressing them. I have else- where defended a view which can be summarized as follows: A statement is a law if and only if it is genuinely corroborable and corroborated both empirically and theoretically (see Niiniluoto and Tuomela (1973), ch. 11). This view comes relatively close to Popper's view with two important modifications. For Popper a statement is a law if and only if it is deduc- ible from a statement function which is satisfied in all worlds which differ from our world at most with respect to initial conditions. If we (a) use the concept of a pure law of working (cf. Mackie [1974]) instead of Popper's too general notion of a statement function and (b) substitute 'deducible or inducible' for 'deducible' we seem to get an acceptable idea of a nomic generalization. (Inducibility is here to be understood in the sense of Niiniluoto and Tuomela [1973].) Notice also that our notion of lawhood is further qualified so that it does not satisfy any strong logical principles of transformation (cf. Section III). As a consequence none of the "usual" arguments requiring the use of modal implications in laws apply. We shall still below make some specific remarks concerning the logical form of a causal law to get an idea of the logical aspects of lawhood. As to the prescriptive side of causal laws, we may say that a law en- titles the user of the law to certain expectations, if not directly to some actions. Thus if we have a law which says that property P necessitates property Q, a user of the law is entitled to expectation statements like 'If a were P then one is entitled to expect that a would be Q'. One can also put this in explicitly deontic terms. 'If a were P one ought to expect that a would be Q'. This kind of modal force of laws essentially comes from the role of laws in backing singular explanatory inferences. We shall technically im- plement this in terms of the conditional &gt;-a in Section VI below. Our Do can be interpreted as a conditional obligation operator analogously with the strictly variable conditional l-+ of Lewis (1973a). Next we make a few remarks concerning the logical form of causal laws from the extensionalist or descriptivist point of view. I think that rather little can be said about the problem in general, i.e. without rela-</page><page sequence="20">344 RAIMO TUOMELA tivization to a specific science or type of theorizing. However, some generality can be claimed for the following two types of deterministic causal laws formalized within standard first-order logic (cf. Kim [1973a]): (i) (x) (y) (P(x) &amp; R(x, y)-*Q(y)) (ii) (x) (P(x)-+(Ey) (Q(y) &amp; R(x, y))). Here the predicates 'P' and 'Q' are complex interpreted predicates of singular events (with a "pragmatic commentary"). They include pred- icates for initial conditions of a sufficiently abstract level. The predicate 'R' is a (universal) pairing or coordinating predicate. It is supposed to correctly pair the instances of the generic properties (or events) P and Q. The following example shows the need for such pairing. If two ad- jacent guns are fired simultaneously and if these two events cause two deaths, how can the causes and effects be paired so that a cause becomes correlated with its effect and an effect with its cause. It often seems plau- sible to require of the pairing relation that it makes causes and effects unique (vis-a-vis the other element in the pairing relation). The main difference between the laws (i) and (ii) is that (ii) guarantees the existence of an effect for every cause, whereas (i) does not. Both of these laws represent sufficient causes only. The symbol '-a' can here represent either a material implication or a more complex connection, like in the Simon-Kron theory to be discussed below. We now turn to two examples of causal theories, especially relevant for the social sciences, both of which take into account some necessity and sufficiency aspect of causation, though in different senses. We now turn to these examples. Mackie has analyzed singular causes in terms of generic necessary and sufficient conditions (Mackie [1965], cf. also Mackie [1974]). While the full generic cause of a property or generic event P may be its necessary and sufficient condition, what we normally call "a cause" is not. Mackie's analysis is based on the view that a cause is an insufficient but necessary part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the result (see Mackie [1965], p. 245). Such a cause is called an INUS- condition. Mackie's approach is thus concerned with the form of a causal theory as his conditions belong to generic events (broadly understood). His idea seems useful for explaining causation in some ordinary life situations</page><page sequence="21">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 345 where knowledge (and beliefs) are formulated in rough terms by means of necessary and sufficient conditions. E.g. a cause for the occurrence of a car accident or for a fire or perhaps even for the declaration of war by a nation might conceivably be given in these terms. Mackie explicates his idea of an INUS-condition in terms of the dis- junction of all the minimal sufficient conditions of a given (generic) event constituting a necessary and sufficient condition of it: "A is an INUS condition of a result P if and only if for some X and for some Y (AX or Y) is a necessary and sufficient condition of P, but A is not a sufficient condition of P and X is not a sufficient condition of P" (Mackie [1965], p. 246). Here the term X stands for the conjunction of terms which to- gether with A constitute a minimal sufficient condition of P. The term Y represents the disjunction of other minimal sufficient conditions. For example, P might represent the generic event of a fire taking place, A the occurrence of a short-circuit at the place in question (necessary con- dition for P), and X other conditions which jointly with A make the conjunction AX sufficient for P. (Of course Y contains other additional INUS-conditions for P.) There are a couple of central remarks that can be added here. First, the INUS-theory represented above quantifies existentially over the predicates X and Y. In other words, it is a theory in the form of a Ramsey sentence. If some predicate constants are found to substitute for X and Y we get an "ordinary" first-order theory (see, e.g. Tuomela [1973], ch. III on Ramsey sentences and theoretical concepts). In any case, a backing law or theory can very well be only a Ramsey sentence. Secondly, if the backing law in Mackie's analysis really is nomological it will sustain the following counterfactuals: (i) For any x, if x had (AX or Y), when in fact it does not, there would have been a y which is P. (ii) For any x, if x did not have P, even if it in fact does have P, there would not have been any y which has (AX or Y). However, the notion of singular cause we are analyzing does not pre- scribe that the backing theory must give either sufficient or necessary conditions for the generic effect-event in the above manner. But our analysis comes closer to requiring that certain singular conditionals should be true. Using our earlier symbols D and D' (which here corre-</page><page sequence="22">346 RAIMO TUOMELA spond to 'e has A' and 'e' has P') we may consider the following three singular conditionals: (a) If D, then D', given the circumstances. (b) If -D, then -D', given the circumstances. (c) If D', then D, given the circumstances. The circumstances are here taken to include statements concerning the occurrence or non-occurrence of all the factors in the causal field pre- supposed. Obviously it includes all the factors the theory speaks about (e.g. X and Y) but also contextual factors. We shall later discuss the acceptability of these and related weaker conditionals. What interests us in this connection is that the conditionals (i), (ii), and (a)-(c), if true, provide a roundabout and indirect way of characterizing the backing theory. For instance, (i) and (ii) may be true also for more complicated theories than considered above, and they may in some cases provide our only "information" about the backing theory. Similarly, (a)(c) give still a much more indirect way of characterizing the backing theory. For in- stance, in many cases these conditionals may be true just in the case of Mackie's INUS-theory considered above. The second example I wish to take up briefly originally comes from economics. Simon (1953) has presented an analysis of causality in terms of identifiability of certain variables by means of certain other variables. These variables represent conditions, and hence generic events in our terminology. We might be simultaneously interested in the causal rela- tionship between variables such as the growth and price of wheat, and the effects of rain and fertilizers on them, etc. One may try to analyze all this within first-order logic and develop a full blown logical theory of causality. This is what Kron (1975) has done in an interesting way on the basis of Simon's ideas. It is not possible to present Kron's important results here for limitations in scope. Let me just say a few words about it in order to have an idea of how our explanatory causal theory S might look like in some of the social sciences. The basic idea is to start with a theory S which contains a "linear" subtheory, say K. This subtheory consists (in the finite case) of formulas K1, K2, ... which are in a certain sense linearly ordered and, in that sense, also causally ordered. The principle of ordering is the identifiability of certain variables in terms of certain other variables, which ordering</page><page sequence="23">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 347 carries over to the formulas K1, K2,... in which these variables occur and also to the models in which these formulas are satisfied. For instance let K= {A (vl, v2), B(v2, V3), CQtl, V3, V4)}- Here v1, . . ., V4 are just the vari- ables in question, and they are essentially ordinary individual variables of standard first-order logic. Now, if K is a causally ordered set, we might have the ordering on the basis of the exogenous variable v2. Then we would have S H (V2) (E! v) (E! V3) (E! V4) A (vl, v2) &amp; B(v2, V3) &amp; &amp; C(V1, V3, V4). Thus for any value of the variable v2 the values of v1, V3, V4 are uniquely determined, i.e. identified. Generally speaking, the variables vi are the entities between which causality holds, and this is justified by reference to the theory S which contains the causally ordered sequence K. Thus we have causality be- tween generic events. The principle of identifiability between variables represents a kind of pairing relation between causes and effects (cf. our discussion earlier in this paper). Notice also that Simon's idea of cau- sality represents controlability of outputs by means of inputs in systems- theoretic terminology. Hence it can easily be given an interventionistic interpretation. Singular causes are obtained by considering the satisfaction of a Kn in some model Mn and its successor formula Kn,+1 in a Mn,+1 (Kn and Kn+ 1 may contain appropriate names for the objects in the models). Such a singular "effect" Kn +1 is derivable from S and the singular "cause" Kn As this Kron-Simon theory of causality is open to "ontological" par- adoxes such as those discussed in Section I. The obvious suggestion then is to complement it with the restrictions expressed by our scheme (C**).4 VI. CONDITIONAL ANALYSES OF SINGULAR CAUSATION In last section we noticed that the backing law account of singular sci- entific causation is closely connected with counterfactuals in the sense that causal laws seem to support conditionals (including counterfactuals) such as (i), (ii), (a), (b), and that also singular causal claims support cer- tain kinds of singular conditionals, such as (a) and (b). Indeed the anal- ysis of causal statements by means of conditionals has been claimed to</page><page sequence="24">348 RAIMO TUOMELA be the central feature of causality. Thus, for instance, Lyon (1967) and Lewis (1973) base their analysis of causality entirely on conditionals (see also Mackie [1974], ch. 2). (These authors seem to mean by 'analysis' only the analysis of the meaning of the concept of a cause.) As I find Lewis' account the best available in this line of thinking, I will mostly concentrate on discussing his results and claims. Lewis combines his analysis of singular causation with a strong criti- cism of (a version of) the "regularity" account which he takes to cover also the backing law approach, it seems. I shall below try to construc- tively defend the backing law account against Lewis' critical remarks. In addition some criticisms against Lewis' approach will be made. In Lewis' approach the term 'counterfactual' is taken to cover any conditionals irrespective of the truth values of their antecedents and con- sequents. Let us consider any two propositions A and C and the counter- factual "If it were the case that A, then it would be the case that C." In his book, Counterfactuals (1973a), Lewis has given a possible world analysis of such counterfactuals. He assumes that possible worlds can be compared in terms of a comparative overall similarity relation (which he takes as an unanalyzed primitive concept). In terms of this concept we can now give a semantical analysis of such counterfactuals as that above. If we symbolize it by A ED-+ C (Ei-- is a "variably strict condi- tional") we can give truth conditions for this counterfactual operator as follows: A li--+ C is true (at world w) if and only if either (1) there are no possible worlds in which A is true (in which case A L--* C is vacuous), or (2) some world where A is true and in which C holds is closer (to w) than is any world in which A is true but where C does not hold (see Lewis [1973b], p. 560). Thus we can say that a counterfactual is nonvacuously true just in case it takes less of a departure from the actual world to make the consequent true along with the antecedent than it does to make the antecedent true without the consequent. (For other characterizations of the truth conditions of E3-* see Lewis [1973a].) I shall not here quarrel. about whether counterfactuals can be regarded as true or false in the same sense as indicatives are true or false. Instead I shall in this paper speak of the truth of counterfactuals in the inclusive Sellarsian sense as 'assertability according to the semantic and material rules of the lan- guage used'. The conditional El-+ has the following central properties. First, A E]--+C</page><page sequence="25">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 349 implies the material conditional A -+ C. Secondly, A and C jointly imply A El-+ C. (Note the symmetry with respect to the actual world!) Thirdly, it is worth emphasizing that A EJ-+ C does not entail the contraposition C EJ-- A, although one is entitled to infer - A from the two premises A }-&gt; C and -C. Now we can give Lewis' definitions for some basic causal notions. As we shall be interested only in causation between two distinct singular events, say c and e, we can explain Lewis' notions as follows. Let now 0(c) and 0(e) be propositions expressing the occurrence of c and e, re- spectively. Analogously 0 (c) and 0(e) express that c and e, respec- tively, did not occur. Then we say that e depends causally on c if and only if the counterfactuals 0 (c) El-+ 0(e) and 0 (c) ZI-+ - 0(e) are true, that is, if and only if the family 0 (e), 0 (e) depends counterfactually (in Lewis' terminology) on the family 0(c), 0(c). Lewis thinks that cau- sation is always transitive. Hence the above notion of causal dependence will not quite do as an explicate of 'a cause', for the former notion clearly is not transitive. Let thus c, d, e, ... be a finite sequence of actual singular events such that d depends causally on c, e on d, and so on throughout. Then this sequence is called a causal chain. Now Lewis defines a singular event c to be a cause of another singular event e if and only if there exists a causal chain leading from c to e. (See Lewis [1973b], pp. 561-563 for a fuller discussion.) Before commenting on Lewis' (1973b) analysis of causation let us summarize his basic criticism against the backing law account. First we notice that Lewis' notion of a regularity (or backing law) account is es- sentially that formulated by our analysis (C) of Section II (provided that S is regarded as an applied theory in our earlier sense and that no sin- gular part of S entails D'). Lewis now goes on to define a notion of nomic dependence: A family C1, C2, ... of pairwise exclusive propositions depends nomically on a family Al, A2, ... of pairwise exclusive propositions if and only if there is an applied theory S such that S implies (but that no singular part of S alone implies) all the material conditionals A1 -+ C1, A2 -+ C2,... between the corresponding propositions in the two families. Here we also say that nomic dependence holds in virtue of S. Next Lewis defines that a proposition B is counterfactually indepen- dent of the family Al, A2,... of alternatives if and only if B would hold</page><page sequence="26">350 RAIMO TUOMELA no matter which of the A's were true - that is, if and only if the counter- factuals A1 EI-+B, A2 EI-*B, ... all hold. Lewis then makes two observations directed against the backing law account (see Lewis [1973b], pp. 564). The first is (essentially) this: (1) If the C's depend nomically on the A's in virtue of S and if all the conjuncts (parts) of S are counterfactually indepen- dent of the A's, then it follows that the C's depend counter- factually on the A's. Lewis concedes that often, perhaps always, counterfactual dependen- cies may be nomically explained in the sense of (1). However he empha- sizes that the requirement of counterfactual independence is still indis- pensable here. Secondly, Lewis shows that nomic dependence in his sense is in a sense reversible, whereas counterfactual dependence is not: (2) If the family C1, C2, ... depends nomically on the family A1, A2, ... in virtue of S, then also A1, A2 ... depends nomically on the family A &amp; C1, A &amp; C2,..., in virtue of S, where A is the disjunction Al vA2 v .... Let us now proceed to an evaluation of Lewis' counterfactual account of causation. I shall start by some relatively general critical remarks di- rected against the philosophical foundations of this account and then go on to defend the backing law account. While I shall not in this context go into a discussion of the clarity and explanatory value of the notion of a set of possible worlds any more than of the semantical adequacy of E-, as elucidating the meaning of counter- factual statements in general, I would like to make a remark on Lewis' concept of similarity. (Recall that his account of the truth conditions and thus the meaning of E}&gt;-+ depends on that notion.) My criticism is that I find it hard to understand similarity (at least in causal contexts) without at least partially elucidating it in terms of nomic or causal necessity. Ob- viously, if my claim really is acceptable then Lewis' attack on the backing law account cannot even get off the ground. To illustrate what I have in mind consider our earlier example in which</page><page sequence="27">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 351 the occurrence of a short-circuit in a house caused a fire. Let s and f represent these singular events. As s and f occurred 0(s) and 0(f) (to use Lewis' terminology) are true and hence is 0(s)LJ-* 0(f). But how about the truth of 0(s) EJ-+ -D 0(f)? This statement is nonvacuously true just in case it takes less of a departure from the actual situation to make 0 (f) true, given the truth of - 0(s), than it does to make 0 (f) false, given the truth of 0 (s). Now how do we account for the fact that 0(s) goes together with 0(f) rather than with 0(f) and hence that the world representing the former case is closer to our actual world than the world represented by the latter construction ? The obvious answer to me is that this relies on a complex nomological connection between short-circuits (with some other relevant factors) and fires. In the situation in question the other possible causal candidates have been blocked some- how, we think, such that the short-circuit is the sole causal candidate left. If an account like this is acceptable similarity becomes dependent on nomicity (rather than vice versa). Indeed, it seems to me almost im- possible to get an elucidation of objective similarity in cases of causation except along the lines sketched above. (To declare similarity an un- analyzable and unelucidable similarity would of course be question- begging.) Let us now consider Lewis' definition of causal dependence and cause. First, I do not accept that (indirect) causes are transitive as Lewis re- quires. However, I shall not here argue for this claim (although it is an obvious consequence of my account) as I will be interested only in the kind of direct causation Lewis' notion of causal dependence explicates. Lewis identifies causal dependence with counterfactual dependence, as we saw. But his analysis is both too wide and too narrow. It is too wide, for instance, because there are counterfactual dependencies which are not causal. If we accept that only events which have occurred can qualify as causes and effects, then the truth of 0(c) EL-*-+. 0 (e) entails under Lewis' analysis not only that e depends causally on c (and that c thus is a direct cause of e) but also that c also is a cause (in Lewis' full sense) of e. But consider the following three statements the first of which is true on semantical and the other two on factual grounds: (a) If John had not gotten married before or in 1974 he would not have divorced in 1974.</page><page sequence="28">352 RAIMO TUOMELA (b) If the sun would not have risen yesterday morning it would not have set last night. (c) If the earth had not cooled a few billion years ago then I would not have written this paper. Thus (a) shows that John's getting married is a cause of his divorce, (b) that sunrise is a cause of sunset, and finally (c) that the earth's cooling caused my writing this paper. But to make the notion of causation this broad is to deprive-it of any scientific interest. (In Kim [1973b] some other additional counter-examples to Lewis' analysis can be found.) We shall later show that Lewis' counterfactual analysis is too wide for other reasons as well. On the other hand, one may claim that Lewis' account is too strict. Thus, in the case of causal prediction, given a singular event c (a cause) this event is supposed to cause another specific singular event e (rather than, for instance, an unspecified singular event exemplifying a generic event). But this is a very strong requirement. Why should my particular punching you in the nose be required ex ante to cause your nose bleeding (etc.) in a certain specific way rather than in another, very closely similar way? Thus, if the aspect property of e is E, should we not satisfy ourselves by requiring only that there is some further unspecified singular event y in E such that c causes y (without requiring y to be e or any other specified member of E)? An analogous remark can be made for cause- events, given a certain effect-event. In terms of Lewis' conditions we may also say this. If c and e have occurred why should we here require the truth of 0 (c) El-- 0 (e) rather than something more general such as e.g. the truth of 'If the generic event C had not been exemplified the generic event E would not have been exemplified' where c and e, respectively, exemplified C and E? Analogously in the case of a non-occurrent cause, to examine the counterfactual aspect E-* is supposed to capture, we may consider our house fire example. Suppose that we in the last moment succeeded in preventing a fire by removing some inflammable material from the place where the defect in the electric wire was. Thus the generic short-circuit event C was not exemplified by any singular event c nor was the generic fire event E exemplified by any singular event e. Thus, for all ceC and es E, 0(c) On-+ 0 (e) is true. However, the requirement that 0 (c) E3-} 0(e) now seems extra-ordinarily strict and hard to satisfy, no matter</page><page sequence="29">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 353 which specific singular events c and e we pick, be they members of C and E, respectively, or not. Let us now consider the following three singular conditionals: (a) 0 (c) El-* 0(e) is true at the world w (b) 0(c) El-*d 0(e) is true at the world w (c) O- 0(e) d- 0(c) is true at the world w. Here the world w is understood to represent "the circumstances" or a certain state of the adopted causal field. Our above considerations seem to make an unqualified universal acceptance of any of these conditionals rather questionable. Considered alone none of them can be regarded as analytically true about any respectable scientific notion of a cause. In conjunction with 0(c) and O(e), however, (a) sounds acceptable, and in conjunction with 0(c) and 0(e) (b) and (c) may seem better accept- able. It must then be said in defense of the counterfactual analysis that if we restrict ourselves to cases where c and e have actually occurred the acceptance of either (b) nor (c) may seem plausible if c and e are thought of only as representatives of the corresponding generic constitutive events C and E. That seems possible. But in the case of non-occurrence of c and e this alternative does not seem viable in view of our remarks above. There are several other problems for a counterfactual analyst con- cerning the acceptance of (a), (b), and (c). For instance, (b) seems to con- flict with cases where there is a plurality of causes (either quantitative or alternative overdetermination, with or without linked cause-events). (See e.g. Lewis [1973a], p. 567, and Mackie [1974], pp. 44-46 for this.) As in my analysis (C**) neither (b) nor (c) is an analytic truth about sin- gular causal statements and as I think this to be a problem for scientists, rather, I shall not here discuss it much further. There are, however, some remarks to be made concerning these con- ditions. First, condition (c) is a kind of strong sufficiency condition. Mackie (1974) requires (b) and (c) to be true of singular causes.5 But as (a) is sufficiency condition why should one accept (c) rather than (a)? As contraposition operation is not valid for conditionals such as E]-* (a) and (c) do not imply each other either way. Consider the statement that, ceteris paribus, rain causes wheat to grow. It would now seem that (a) and (b), but not (c), are acceptable here. (E.g. some insects might have destroyed the crop; hence (c) is not true.)</page><page sequence="30">354 RAIMO TUOMELA A second remark is that Lewis requires his counterfactual to be true only in the actual world (or the world where c and e occur). However, within a deductive-nomological or backing law account one might want to require more. It is a feature of scientific theories that they have some stability properties, viz. their truth is invariant with respect to a great variety of "irrelevant" changes in the universe. So what one might sug- gest to a counterfactual analyst to be worked out is the idea that singular causal statements hold not only in the actual world (given that c and e did occur) but also in worlds in which c and e occurred and which are nomologically close to the actual world. Finally we shall try to defend the backing law account against Lewis' specific criticisms, i.e. his theorems (1) and (2) mentioned earlier. What is wrong with them? The matter seems to me straightforward. What Lewis calls a regularity analysis of causation (see the earlier given defi- nition) simply represents an overly simplified and untenable position. What I mean by this is that that particular version of the regularity theory is (at least formally) identical with an account of deductive explanation rejected long ago (see e.g. the discussion in Tuomela [1972]). According- ly, one may argue that Lewis' definition of nomic dependence, central for the derivation of theorems (1) and (2), is also unacceptable. To be a little more informative and constructive about this I shall now point out some particular reasons why Lewis' claims are unacceptable, and I shall also suggest a better definition for nomic dependence. First we notice that Lewis' notion of nomic dependence is unaccept- able for the reason that it is, at least, too wide: it does not capture rele- vant nomic dependence. There are in fact lots of examples to demonstrate this, but let it suffice to consider only one. Let F(a) be an arbitrary singular statement. Consider some law of the form (x) G(x) such that 'G' belongs to a completely different field of science. Now F(a) (and any disjunction in which F(a) occurs as a dis- junct) can be seen to depend nomically on the singular statement - G (a) v v F(a) in the sense of Lewis' definition. But such "nomic dependence" is of course hardly relevant to questions of causality or explanation or any other philosophically interesting matter. I suggest now that we instead explicate nomic dependence in terms of explanation. Certainly within deductive-nomological explanation the ex- plaining law is nomically relevant to the explanandum. I also think we</page><page sequence="31">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 355 can for our present purposes deal with a strong idea of nomic dependency which entails (deductive) explainability. We then define: A singular statement ft depends nomically on a singular statement D (in symbols D&gt;-*D') if and only if there is an applied theory S such that S cum D deductively explains D' in the full sense of the weak DEL- model of explanation, that is, in the sense of condition (1) of our charac- terization (C**). The generalization of this definition for families of statements is of course obvious. It is immediately seen that my notion of nomic depen- dency entails Lewis' notion (but of course the converse is not true). Now we can consider Lewis' first theorem (1). (We restrict ourselves to finite families below.) Lewis claims that the assumption of counter- factual independence is indispensable. (This assumption is that the com- ponents of the applied theory S should be counterfactually independent of the initial conditions Ai.) However, within actual explanation all the initial conditions must be true and so must the theory S be. Thus in any world in which the relevant nomic dependence holds Ai[ E3--S is true. Thus we get the result that not only is Lewis' theorem (1) false for my notion of nomic dependency but also the following theorem holds: (1*) If the C's depend nomically (in the sense explicated by &gt;a) on the A's in virtue of S, then the C's depend counterfactu- ally on the A's. What we have here is thus an "explanation" of counterfactual depen- dence by means of nomic dependence without any additional counter- factual independence assumption. What happens to Lewis' theorem (2)? It is immediately seen that it does not hold true as it cannot be proved without violating the non- comparability requirement of the weak DEL-model (for we would have A in the explanans for each Ai). It follows instead that nomic dependence is irreversible: (2*) If the family C1, C2,... depends nomically (in the sense of &gt;a+) on the family A1, A2,... in virtue of S then the family A1, A2,... does not depend nomically on the family AC1, A C2, . . . in virtue of S.</page><page sequence="32">356 RAIMO TUOMELA This result gives some additional content to condition (2) of (C**) which says that a cause is "prior" to its effect and that causation hence does not represent a symmetric relationship. In Lewis (1973a) an interesting "correspondence" theorem is estab- lished to exhibit the close logical connection between metalinguistic ac- counts of counterfactuals (used in contexts of singular explanation and causation). To explain this connection we need the notion of cotenability of premises. Lewis gives it the following semantical definition: Proposi- tion A is cotenable with proposition B at a world w if and only if (1) A holds at all worlds accessible from w, or (2) some world in which B is true is closer to w than any world in which A is true. (See Lewis [1973a], p. 57 for more details.) Now the following result can be obtained: A EJ--+B is true at world w if and only if A together with finitely many premises P1, P2,..., P , each cotenable with A and w, logically imply B. Thus a counterfactual is true (or assertable, if you like) on an occasion if and only if there exists an argument backing it. What interests us here is of course the case where the singular state- ment A E7-+B is interpreted as 'B because of A' or 'B depends causally on A'. In those cases the argument backing El-- must be deductive-ex- planatory. To discuss this, we first notice that cotenability can be char- acterized in terms of comparative possibility as follows: the denial of a cotenable premise is less possible than the counterfactual antecedent it- self, unless the antecedent is already minimally possible. In view of this we agree with Lewis in his claim that laws tend to be cotenable with sin- gular antecedents which are not strictly logically inconsistent with the law in question (cf. Lewis [1973a], p. 72). But given this cotenability as- sumption it immediately and trivially follows that ifA &gt;--B is true at a world w then A El--+ B is true at w. 6 However, the converse does not hold. This result of course is based on the fact that our &gt;-* is backed by an explanatory deductive argument which involves logical deducibility but which is stronger than mere deducibility. What this result again shows is that Lewis' EL-+ is far too weak to capture notions like expla- nation and causation. Rather I suggest that my &gt;-D can be taken to ex- plicate singular explanation. That is, A &gt;-+B can be interpreted as 'B because of A', and hence the former is acceptable exactly when the latter is (provided we are concerned with scientific explanation). If the backing</page><page sequence="33">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 357 theory S is required to be a causal theory the 'because of' relation is ex- plicitly a causal relation. Thus the truth of a singular causal claim C(e, e') entails the existence of an assertable statement D &gt;-+D' (the converse holds if the additional clauses of (C**) are satisfied). What we have here is a correlation between "ontological talk" (in terms of objective events) and linguistic "fact talk" (in terms of state- ments involving the occurrence of events). Here we also see what kind of connections there can be between explanatory causes (expressed by D&gt;-+D') and productive causes (in part expressed by C(e, e')). C(e, e') can be taken to fully represent a productive cause only in the Peircean limit science, where the backing theory fully captures the underlying ob- jective causal process. It should be noticed here that as &gt;-+, assuming cotenability, entails Lewis' EI-+, it can be given the same applications as El-+ has. Thus &gt;-a can be interpreted as a conditional obligation operator, although it is much stronger than H]-+. Notice also that &gt;-* takes into account the nomic force of laws in the sense discussed in Section V. We have not yet connected our &gt;-a to Lewis' defining conditions of causation (causal dependence). First, we notice that while the truth of D and D' automatically makes DLI-*D' true (assertable), still D&gt;-+D' is not yet assertable, which fact is just to the good. However, the latter of course has to become assertable in order to make C(e, e') true. This means that I accept that also D &gt;-+D' is assertable. This statement con- cerns singular events, but, given that e and e' have indeed occurred, it can still be viewed as primarily concerned with the generic events the backing theory speaks about. Secondly, whereas Lewis requires that -D L-D' be true, it might seem too strong to require analogously that D &gt;-+ -D' be assertable. We have to notice that "it is not the case that e occurred" cannot meaning- fully be said to explain or cause that "it is not the case that e' occurred." But if we interpret D &gt;-* D' as 'without D, D' is not explainable' it may seem acceptable. If we then use 'assertable' in a broad Sellarsian way covering this usage, we can interpret D &gt;-+ - D' as 'If D were not assertable, then D' would not be assertable'. Under this interpretation 1-D&gt;--+-D' will probably be often assertable in cases when C(e,e') holds, although my account of causality does not require it. For instance, if there are genuine cases of overdeternination, -D &gt;-+ D' is not in</page><page sequence="34">358 RAIMO TUOMELA this broader sense assertable. Thus consider an example where two switches a and b are flipped simultaneously such that both were sufficient for the light to go on. Then neither flipping a-nor flipping b was individ- ually necessary (at least under that description). Both were "sufficient parts" of the total cause. - If we, however, are interested in necessary and sufficient causes only, we can do it by requiring that both D &gt;-*D' and -D &gt;- D- be true. There is a related counterfactual concerning generic events which seems to be always assertable in view of the nomic character of the backing theory. If the generic events or properties it connects are C and E we seem to be in a position to assert 'If C were exemplified, E would be exemplified'. However, this clearly is not yet sufficient for the assert- ability of -D &gt;- D' even under the above final liberal interpretation of it, given that the cause and effect occurred. There are many problems of causality which I have not touched at all above.7 Still, it seems to me that the backing law account of scientific causation I have tried to defend can cope with these problems at least as well as any other account. I hope to have shown that the prospects for a full backing law account look all but dark. University of Helsinki NOTES * My research for this paper was supported by the Academy of Finland. The hard question in discussing event identity is how to characterize the identity of aspect properties. I am willing to assume the possibility of contingent identities holding between them. I cannot, however, in this paper discuss at any length the difficult problems involved here. 2 Note here that unless deductive explanation is given a stringent formulation all kinds of paradoxes ensue already on the linguistic level of statements quite independently of any ontological and semantical assumptions (such as (I) or (L)). For instance, even within the original Hempel-Oppenheim model it is possible to explain practically any singular state- ment by means of almost any explanans. This same remark applies to all attempts to clarify philosophical notions by means of some kind of subsumption. For instance, of the definitions of determinism at least the one by Berofsky, but also that by Goldman, are affected and trivialized by exactly this paradox (see Goldman [1970], p. 172 and Berofsky [1971l, p. 168)). Similarly this linguistic deducibility paradox seems to affect Goldman's definition of level-generation of action in Goldman (1970), p. 43. 3 Thus, for instance, both of the following two arguments are valid potential explanations in our (weak) DEL-model:</page><page sequence="35">CAUSES AND DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION 359 F(x) (y) (F(x, y)G(x, y)) F(a, b) G(a, b) (i)(y) (F(a, y)-G(a, y)) F(a, b) G(a, b) 4 Let us here mention a criticism, which, if true would be unpleasant for a backing law account. Namely, it has been claimed that causes cannot be regarded as conditions or properties which are both necessary and sufficient for the effect condition (see Brand and Swain (1970)). However, as has been shown, Brand's and Swain's analysis is based on certain unacceptable assumptions on the logical properties of necessary-and-sufficient conditions. Especially their principle (P3) requiring transitivity as well as their (P4) requiring uniqueness of a necessary and sufficient causal condition for the effect seem un- acceptable (cf. Hilpinen [1974] and the papers referred to in it). Also in the analysis by Kron [1975] a cause can be a necessary and sufficient condition without contradiction. It should be mentioned here that Lewis (1973b) analyzes a (kind of direct) cause just in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the counterfactual D-} (see Section VI of this paper). That analysis fails to satisfy just Brand's and Swain's conditions (P3) and (P4), as is easily seen. It should also be pointed out that the analogous notion of causality definable in terms of our analysis (C**) (and more exactly in terms of our &gt;-+ to be dis- cussed in Section VI) also fails to satisfy the problematic conditions (P3) and (P4). 5 Mackie seems to take (a) and (c) to be equivalent, however (see Mackie [1974], p. 49). There are good reasons for thinking that that cannot be the case for any reasonable inter- pretation of a non-material conditional (cf. e.g. Lewis' [1973a] arguments). 6 In more like Goodman's idea we may define a weaker notion of cotenability by saying that S is cotenable with A at w if and only if S is true at w and A L- S is true at w. The correspondence theorem for the metalinguistic and counterfactual accounts discussed on p. 356 above also holds for this second notion of cotenability (cf. Lewis [1973a], 70). But the premises of any actual (weak) DEL-explanation are easily proved to be cotenable in this sense (as A and S are true), whence &gt;-D is seen to entail G-. directly, too. 7 For instance, I have not here dealt with problems such as a) the problem of effects, b) the problem of epiphenomena, and c) the problem of pre-emption (see e.g. Lewis [1973b], pp. 565-567). However, solutions of a) and b) are easily and directly on the basis of what has been said earlier about the causal relation C(e, e'). In the case of c) one cause-event supersedes another cause-event, but no formal contradiction for my account is involved. To make the problem more interesting the nature of the interaction between these events would have to be specified in more detail, and I think that would in fact bring backing laws into play.
