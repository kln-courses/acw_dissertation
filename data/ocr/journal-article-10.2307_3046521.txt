<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLIEST PAINTED PANELS OF CATALONIA (IV)' By WALTER W. S. COOK (8) THE SAINT ANDREW ALTAR-FRONTAL FROM SAGARS REE panels which formerly hung together and were parts of the same altar are now divided between the Episcopal Museums of Vich and Solsona. They were found in the church of St. Andrew at Sagars,2 a small parish church to the northwest of Vich, in the diocese of Solsona. The antependium from the front of the altar, which represents scenes from the life of St. Andrew, was brought to the Museum of Vich by Bishop Morgades. The side panels, which were overlooked by the bishop, were found several years later in the church at Sagars by Dr. Serra i Vilar6, the learned scholar and director of the Episcopal Museum at Solsona, who brought them to that museum. One of the Solsona panels represents scenes from Gene- sis and the Passion of Christ, the other, scenes from the life of the Virgin. The antependium, now at Vich (Fig. i),3 is the earliest preserved example in Spain with scenes from the life of St. Andrew. It is divided by bands of stucco ornament into a wide central compartment and four slightly narrower lateral compartments. The en- tire composition is surrounded by a narrow band of stucco ornament and a wide frame. In the Majestas Domini of the central compartment (Fig. 2) Christ has a red beard and moustache and long red hair. His face is somewhat mutilated: only the outlines of the nose, eyes, and ears are now visible. His orange nimbus is embellished with con- centric circles and the arms of the cross are shaded. He wears a dark green mantle, which falls over the left shoulder and is draped over the knees, and a wide-sleeved orange tunic, covered with fine red and white lines. On the left knee He holds the Book i. For previous articles in this series see The Art Bul- letin, V, 4, PP. 85 ff.; VI, 2, pp. 31 ff; VIII, 2, pp. 57 ff. See note 2 of the last article for an acknowledgment of the generous help given me in these studies. 2. Sagars (Saga's, Sagasse) is situated in the Llusanes, near the road which goes from Gironella to Prats. The place is mentioned in the act of consecration of La Seo d'Urgel (Puig y Cadafalch, L'arquitectura romanica a Catalunya, Barcelona, 1911, I, p. 408). The church, which has been much restored, especially at the west end, has a triple apse, nave, and single aisles, and is simi- lar in proportions to many other eleventh century churches of this period in Catalonia.

The right hand is raised in benediction. The wide seat on which He is enthroned has a diaper pattern of two- colored squares, each of which is subdivided diagonally into green and orange triangles. The outlines of the triangles are indicated by white pearl dots, and the squares are surrounded by brown stripes on which were painted narrow black stripes containing a series of white circles. The large yellow bolster is covered with a fine network of red and green lines. The figure is relieved against a dark green background and surrounded by an oval mandorla embellished with a foliate scroll in low-relief stucco. The four symbols of the evangelists, depicted in the dark red spandrels outside the mandorla, are anthropomorphic in character, with human bodies and the heads of the symbols. In the upper left spandrel is the symbol of St. John, with the head of an eagle; in the upper right, the symbol of St. Matthew, with the head of a man; in the lower left, St. Mark, with the head of a lion; and in the lower right, St. Luke, with the head of an ox. The story of St. Andrew begins in the upper left compartment (Fig. 3), where the saint is conducted by two guards from the presence of Aegeas into prison. "And the blessed S. Andrew, whilst he was in Achaia, he replenished all the country with churches and converted the people to the faith of Jesu Christ and informed the wife of Aegeas, which was the provost and judge of the town, in the faith, and baptized her. And when Aegeas heard this he came into the city of Patras and constrained the Christians to sacrifice. And S. Andrew came unto him, and said: It behooveth thee which hast deserved to be a judge, to know thy judge which is in heaven, and he so known, to worship him, and so worshipping, withdraw thy courage from the false gods ... And then said Aegeas: Tell to thy disciples such vanities, and obey thou to me, and make sacrifice unto the Gods almighty. And then said S. Andrew: I offer every day unto God Almighty, a lamb without spot, and after that he is received of all the people, so liveth he and is all whole. Then demanded Aegeas how that might be. And Andrew said: Take the form for to be a disciple, and thou shalt know it well. I shall demand thee, said Aegeas, by torments. Then he being all angry, commanded that he should be en- closed in prison."4 The proconsul Aegeas, seated on an orange throne on the extreme left, holds a tall spear in his left hand and his right is raised in a gesture of speech. He is represented with dark red hair, beard, and moustache, and a large red halo, inscribed with concentric wavy lines. He is clothed in an orange mantle, clasped at the right shoulder, a dark green robe with long sleeves, and a long orange tunic, and dark san- dals. St. Andrew, who holds his right palm outward in a gesture of protest, is about to be led away by two guards. He also has dark red hair and beard. He wears a long orange tunic and light yellow mantle; and he has a dark green halo and is barefoot. The guard on the left, clad in a short green tunic and light orange hose, siezes the saint 4.

The prison, shown on the right, is a dark green building with a round-arched portal and three fortified towers. From the crene- lated top of the central tower appear the head and shoulders of the jailer, who sounds a long yellow oliphant. This scene, as is the case with the other three shown in the side compartments, is placed against a diaper background consisting of red and yellow rectangles. In the second scene (Fig. 4), directly below the first, the saint is condemned to die by crucifixion and is led away by two guards. "And on the morn he came to judgment, and the blessed S. Andrew unto the sacrifice of the idols. And Aegeas commanded to be said to him: If thou obey not to me, I shall do hang thee on the cross, for so much as thou hast praised it. And thus as he menaced him of many torments S. Andrew said to him: Think what torment that is most grievous that thou mayst do to me, and the more I suffer, the nore I shall be agreeable to my king, because I shall be most firm in the torments and pain. Then commanded Aegeas that he should be beaten of twenty- one men, and that he should be so beaten, bounden by the feet and hands unto the cross, to the end that his pain should endure the longer."' As in the preceding scene, Aegeas is seated in a frontal position on the extreme left. The Dagobert throne has lion heads and claws. In his left hand Aegeas holds a long scepter, terminating in small branches, and he wears a dark red halo, orange mantle, dark green robe, and em- broidered sandals. The saint and the two guards, who are leading him away, are dressed as in the scene above. Beyond them two disciples exhort St. Andrew not to abandon the faith. The disciple on the right is represented with a yellow halo, inscribed with zigzag lines, and is clad in a violet tunic and mantle; the second disciple is shown with an orange tunic, a dark green mantle, and a green halo inscribed with a series of white dots. Both are beardless and each holds a Book of the Gospels in the left hand. Above are two yellow eight-pointed stars. Various interpretations have been given for the scene in the lower right compart- ment (Fig. 5), where a woman and three beardless disciples gaze at the figure of a small boy who, with upstretched hands, stands on the shoulders of a youth. According to Gudiol6 this scene represents St. Andrew, symbolized by the boy, entrusting his soul to the Creator. It seems more likely, however, that this is a genre passage interpolated in the narrative, of a child standing on a man's shoulders in order to obtain a better view of the crucifixion of St. Andrew, depicted above. The small stature of the man and the mature proportions of the child cannot be considered as objections in view of the im- poverished naturalism of this style. The isolation of the group and the lack of any in- dication of the throng which would explain the child's position are to be expected in an art which is narrative and descriptive but which does not strive at representation.

The woman on the extreme left, clad in an orange gown, embroidered sandals, and a dark green mantle which covers her head, may possibly represent Maximilla, the converted wife of the proconsul. The crucifixion of St. Andrew and the death of Aegeas are shown in the upper right compartment (Fig. 6). "And then they hung him on the cross, like as to them was commanded. And there he lived two days, and preached to twenty thousand men that were there. And then all the company swore the death of Aegeas, and said: The holy man and debonair ought not to suffer this. Then came thither Aegeas for to take him down off the cross. And when Andrew saw him he said: Wherefore art thou come to me, Aegeas ? If it be for penance thou shalt have it, and if it be for to take me down, know thou for certain thou shalt not take me hereof alive: for I see now my lord and king that abideth for me. And when the holy S. Andrew saw that the world would have taken him down off the cross he made this orison hanging on the cross, as S. Aus- tin saith in the book of penance: Sire, suffer me not to descend from this cross alive,... Command my body unto the earth, so that it behoveth no more to wake, but let it be stretched freely to thee, which art fountain of joy never failing. And when he had said this, there came from heaven a right great shining light, which environed him by the space of half an hour, in such wise that no man might see him. And when this light de- parted he yielded and rendered therewith his spirit. And Maximilla, the wife of Aegeas, took away the body of the apostle, and buried it honourably. And ere that Aegeas was come again to his house, he was ravished with a devil by the way, and died tofore them all."7 Naked except for an orange loin cloth, the saint is tied hand and foot by means of cords to a black cross. He has long red hair and beard and is represented as alive, since his eyes are still open. Rays of wavy light descend from heaven and envelop the arms of the cross. The death of Aegeas is depicted on the left, where a red-bearded devil plunges a dagger into the back of the proconsul. Aegeas falls to the ground, throwing his right hand over his face in a gesture of pain, and a second devil drags him down to hell. Above is the inscription DIABOLVS OCCIDIT EGEAS-"the devil kills Aegeas." The proconsul wears a dark green mantle and an orange-colored tunic and hose. Both devils have bushy red beards and the devil that stabs Aegeas has red hair standing on end like a coxcomb. The bevel of the wide frame surrounding the antependium is decorated with a red and green zigzag ribbon on an orange ground. The outer surface of the frame is richly decorated on all four sides with a continuous foliate motif interwoven to form an X design. A thin white line emphasizes the outlines of the dark red and black leaves, 7.

The foliate motif is placed against a yellow background, and the narrow border, against a dark red background. The pattern is intercepted at the four corners and at the centers of the sides of the frame by circular yellow medallions and each medallion is surrounded by a narrow band containing a series of yellow pearls with dots. We have already noted, in our discussion of the Vich altar-canopy, that the zig- zag ribbon, which appears here without the trefoil filling pattern, is an old mediaeval motif.8 The interlaced foliate design is less frequently found, although it appears oc- casionally during the Romanesque period, as shown by Gumpert's Bible in Erlangen.9 The twisted-rope pattern, interrupted as here by horizontal strands, is more common, appearing frequently in Carolingian manuscripts of the ninth century,o0 whence it passed into later Mozarabic manuscripts and other works of art of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Circular medallions as a decorative motif are also found during the Carolingian period, when they are usually employed only at the corners of the cbmposition." It is, however, probable that their use on our panel was inspired by antependia in gold and silver where large cabochon crystals were inserted at the four corners and in the centers of the frames. The influence of metal work is even more apparent in the stucco ornament. The rinceau employed on the mandorla, on the vertical dividing strips, and on the border surrounding the entire composition is similar in form to that found throughout the Middle Ages" but the modeling of the pattern in low-relief stucco shows an obvious attempt to reproduce the effect of filagree work, such as that found on metal book- covers. The degenerate bead-and-reel stucco design with half reels and pearl orna- ment, which is employed on the horizontal strips dividing the upper and lower lateral compartments of the panel, is again an attempt to approximate the impression of jewel work, and can be compared with the uncut stones which adorn the mandorla of the twelfth century diptych in the Camera Santa at Oviedo.'3 All traces of color have disappeared from the stucco on our panel, which is now a dull grey, but in its original state, when the stucco was gilded, the general effect must have been similar to that of the ornament on the Oviedo diptych. The unusually good state of this altar-frontal is due in large measure to the fact 8. The Art Bulletin, V, 4, p. 97. 9. Swarzenski, Salzburger Malerei, pl. XXXV, fig. II7. Io.

In fact, the manner in which the Catalan antependia were constructed can be well demonstrated by this example. Heavy, wide planks, still show- ing on the back the blows of the adze, were joined together horizontally with wooden dowels, which can be seen where the planks have warped apart. Small iron clamps were also employed on the back to reinforce the dowels, and strips of canvas were stretched over the line of joining. The ends of the planks were then fitted into a deep groove cut into the side frames, which consisted of heavy beams and were riveted into place with iron clamps and wooden dowels. Near the edge of the side frames a long vertical groove was cut (.89 x .023 m.) and into this groove the side panels, now in the Museum at Sol- sona (Figs. 29 and 30), were fitted and doweled into place. The ends of the antepen- dium frames were often ornamented, as shown by this panel, where green stripes were painted on an orange ground. The back of the altar-frontal was invariably left in a rough state but the front was planed down smooth and covered with rough linen; on this surface the artist drew his composition and applied the stucco ornament. Although the ornament of our panel shows the influence of metal work, the com- position, draftsmanship, and color are directly influenced by the local manuscript style. This is best shown by the drawing of the enormous eyes, the diminutive ears, the closely cropped beards, the noses with nostrils indicated by a single stroke, the shading of the flesh tones of hands and faces, and the rendering of the feet. The tache on the cheek, which assumed the form of a triangle in the St. Lawrence panel at Vich, is treated here in much the same manner. The drapery, which falls to the ankles in straight lines, showing many reminiscences of an old drapery style, is ornamented with fine brush strokes. Another feature typical of the manuscript style of Spain is the treatment of the backgrounds in the lateral compartments, where each scene is divided in checker-board fashion into red and yellow rectangles. This unusual arrangement is a common formula in Leon-Castile, and can be illustrated by a page from the thirteenth century Beatus manuscript in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Fig. 7). On this example the solid fields of color are relieved by eight-pointed stars, whereas on our panel the rectangles are decorated with parallel wavy lines and twisted-rope ornament. The introduction of architecture into a scene is fairly common in Catalan Roman- esque sculpture but is seldom found on the early painted panels. There is no attempt to render perspective. The prison, shown in the upper left compartment of our ante- pendium is on the same plane as the figures outside, that are represented as tall as the building itself.

It is obvious that the antependium under discussion has very little value artistically. Its most interesting features are iconographic. In the examples of Majestas Domini already studied the seat of Christ has been either a bench-like throne supported by two uprights,'7 a globe,,'8 or the globe mandorla,19 but in this altar-frontal the throne ex- tends across the entire width of the mandorla and bisects it. This is undoubtedly a variant or derivative of the masonry throne found in the two stucco antependia from Esterri de Card6s.2o The masonry throne, as I have already shown in my study of the stucco antependia,21 was common in southern France and Spain during the twelfth century. It appears, for example, on the Majestas Domini relief in the ambulatory of the church of St. Sernin at Toulouse22 and in a twelfth century Tortosa manuscript (Fig. io), where the throne completely fills the lower half of the mandorla. The masonry technique does not appear on our altar-frontal, but it must be supposed that the artist has intended to suggest this type of throne covered with a rich brocade. The type may have originated in Italy, since a similar arrangement is found on an ivory plaque in the 14. The city is identified by the inscription civitas regia toletana. Buildings are frequently represented in early Mozarabic codices, especially in the Beatus manu- scripts, where the cities of Jerusalem, Babylon, Susa, Philadelphia, and other towns are shown. Cf. Morgan Beatus MS. no. 644, fols. 48, 52 v., 185, 202 v., 240 v.

Similar in type to those preserved in many Euro- pean cathedral treasuries.

Terret, La sculpture bourguignone, pl. LX), and on a destroyed mosaic of the cathedral of Brindisi, showing archbishop Turpin and Roland (Mile, L'art religieux du XII siecle, fig. 175). 16.

Similar buildings are also found in Catalan manuscripts, such as the Liber antiquitatum, which shows the castle of Ribes with three towers with a cross at the top of the central tower (ibid., III, fig. 862) and the Liber Feu- dorum, which shows the castles of Taltavull and Penna with three towers and round-arched doorways (ibid., III, fig. 863). Typical Catalan buildings of the period are the tower of the palace at Tarragona, with a cre- nelated parapet (ibid, III, fig. 88o) and the castle of Peratallada, a restoration of which is illustrated by Puig y Cadafalch (op. cit., III, p. 644). 17.

Angelo in Formis.24 The slight curve which is plainly visible can be explained if we suppose that the Catalan artist has copied his figure from an apse fresco, reproducing faithfully the slight curve which would appear to the spectator when the fresco is seen from below. The anthropomorphic form of the symbols of the evangelists, in which the head of the symbol is shown on a human body instead of the more common animal body, is seldom found in the art of Catalonia. In fact, its use in this panel, where it is employed in the spandrels of the central compartment, is one of the few instances which can be cited on monuments of eastern Spain.25 The motif appears in Western art as early as the eighth century, as shown by the Gospels in the church of Maeseyck, written in southern England (c. 770),26 and the north French Orosius manuscript at Laon (c. 760).27 In the Sacramentary of Gellone, which Zimmerman assigns to the diocese of Meaux and dates in the year 780,28 the evangelists are represented by full-length human figures with the heads of their symbols, whereas in the early Latin manuscript at Poitiers (Fig. I I), which Mr. Friend assigns to central France and to the eighth century,29 only the busts are shown as in the Orosius manuscript, enclosed within medallions. According to Janitschek30 the anthropomorphic symbols were imported from Syria, but this statement cannot be confirmed by extant monuments from that region. It is not improbable that certain elements of the type may have originated in the Orient, since similar combinations of a human body and animal head were common in the art of ancient Egypt and Assyria31 and continued in the East until a late period. But from whatever source the motif may originally have been derived, the form found in Europe during the eighth century was a thoroughly naturalized Western type32 which circu- lated widely in late Latin manuscripts. Through the medium of manuscripts the anthropomorphic symbols were carried into Visigothic Spain, where they were in widespread use from the ninth to the twelfth century. On the earliest Mozarabic manuscripts the symbols usually appear above the 23. A. Venturi, Storia dell 'arte italiana, Milan, 1902, II, fig. 462. 24.

In the bas-reliefs from Nineveh the human body with the head and wings of the eagle is not dissimilar in form to that of the symbol of St. John in the Sacra- mentary of Gellone, and the similarity would be even more apparent if a scroll were substituted for the pine cone and basket carried by the Assyrian deity. 32.

Sometimes a single human figure with an animal head and wings is portrayed, or all four symbols are shown together in the same folio. On one page of a manuscript in the archives of San Isidoro at Leon all four symbols are anthro- pomorphic and winged, while on another page of the same manuscript (Fig. 12) the two symbols above the lower arches have the animal form, the two upper symbols are anthropomorphic, and all four are without wings. One of the most unusual combina- tions is that illustrated in Fig. 13, a page from the Bible in the cathedral archives at Leon, 33written by the deacon Juan in the year 920, where the symbol of Mark is repre- sented by a lion attached to the figure of a winged angel. In the numerous copies of the Beatus manuscripts, beginning with the early tenth century version in the Morgan library,34 the anthropomorphic symbols were almost never omitted. The symbol of St. John in the Astorga Beatus, now at the John Rylands Library, Manchester,3s recalls the symbol in the Sacramentary of Gellone. In the late twelfth century copy at Paris (Fig. I5) the human busts are attached to circular discs, symbolical of the fiery wheels of Ezekiel. In this manuscript the significance of the whirling wheels is almost entirely lost and is much better shown in an earlier manuscript, the Morals of St. Gregory (Fig. 14) executed in 945 at Baleranica or Baralangas (Burgos) by Florenncio, where the rotary effect of the wheels is clearly suggested.36 The late persistence of early types can be further demonstrated by the thirteenth century Beatus in the Morgan Library, where the symbol of Mark is again represented as a winged human body with the head of a lion. On another folio of this manuscript (Fig. 16) the four symbols are seated at desks and write their Gospels. The influence of the Beatus manuscripts on the Romanesque Spanish Bibles and frescoes is demonstrated by a page from the Bible of Avila (fol. 327) (Fig. 17) and the ceiling of the Pantheon of the Kings at San Isidoro, Leon, where the anthropomorphic types are again employed. In Catalonia, on the other hand, this form is seldom found, although the Bible of Farfa shows the use of the four animal heads attached to a single human body (Fig. I8). There is, in fact, no region in western Europe where the an- thropomorphic type was so common as in Leon-Castile, and the frequency with which it appears in this section of the Peninsula is additional evidence of the conservative, retardataire character of the Mozarabic manuscript style, which retained features of the late Latin style longer than other European schools. The anthropomorphic form does not appear to have been adopted by the West 33.

It does ap- pear, however, in the East Frankish schools, as shown by a ninth century ivory of the school of Metz, where the evangelistic symbols are seated.37 It also continues in the Rhenish and German schools as late as the twelfth century;38 the symbol of St. John on a page from a Regensburg manuscript39 is identical in form with that shown in the Sacramentary of Gellone. Sporadic examples are also found in England4o and Italy.4' The appearance of the motif in central and southern France during the twelfth cen- tury, as illustrated by a Gospel page from Limoges (Fig. 20),42 where the busts of the symbols surround the figure of the Majestas Domini as on our Catalan panel, may be due to Spanish influence. But this influence from Spain may have been overempha- sized by M. Male, who, when explaining the derivation of an anthropomorphic symbol on a capital in the cloister at Moissac,43 states that "un motif si itrange, et tout dfait isol/ dans notre art franfais du XII siecle, prouve clairement que r'artiste afeuillet6 un manuscrit de Beatus pour y cbercber l'inspiration."44 Iconographic forms popular in Spain were common in southern France, as M. Mile has clearly demonstrated, but the presence of the motif at Moissac may equally well represent the survival of an old Merovingian tradition in that region. The anthropomorphic form of the symbols appears elsewhere in France during the twelfth century, as shown by the Bible of St. Yrieix,4S and the Bible of St. B6nigne at Dijon (Fig. 19),46 where the symbol of Luke 37.

The occasional appearance of the formula in Catalonia, as illustrated by our panel, must undoubtedly be regarded as a late survival of the local manuscript style which was subject to influence from the Mozarabic school at the opposite end of the Peninsula. The lateral compartments of this antependium from Sagars are no less interesting than the central, since this is the earliest preserved panel which portrays the life and acts of St. Andrew, and it exhibits several features seldom found on other antependia. The representation of the tyrant Aegeas with a nimbus, in the two scenes on the left, is unusual, inasmuch as in the later art of western Europe this attribute is usually reserved for the deity, Christ, saints or apostles, as an emblem of holiness.47 No such distinction was made in antiquity, since the Hellenistic nimbus merely connotes power or authority; it is worn by divinities in Pompeian wall painting and is given indiscrim- inately to gods, personifications,48 and rulers.49 It is significant that most of the Early Christian examples are found in the East, where Hellenistic tradition was stronger, and here the nimbus is given in Christian scenes to very unexpected persons, such as Herod in the scene of the Massacre of the Innocents"0 and Saul in David scenes.5' The emperor Honorius wears it on the ivory diptych at Aosta,52 of the early fifth century. This Hellenistic practice persisted in Latin usage as well as in the Orient. In the West the emperors Justinian and Constantine Pogonatus wear the nimbus in mosaics of the sixth and seventh centuries at Ravenna.53 It is also worn by Herod in the arch mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore of the fifth century54 and is still worn by divinities in the second Vatican Virgil, which is now ascribed to a Gallic hand of the fifth or sixth cen- tury. It must thus be seen that the nimbus used as a mark of distinction and without reference to sanctity is an antique motif, persisting where Latin traditions subsisted unimpaired, and its use in our panel is additional evidence of the strength of the late Latin tradition in the Peninsula. It is instructive to compare the two scenes in our panel in which the apostle appears cit., in Nouveaux milanges, II, pp. Io8-I13, reproduc- tion). 47.

On a page from a Bavarian manu- script (Fig. 21) executed at Freising in the second half of the eleventh centuryss the audience with the proconsul and the incarceration are shown at the bottom of the page in two separate scenes. The episodes are also quite separate in a twelfth century Regensburg manuscript (Fig. 26) 56 where they are divided by a column. On an enameled triptych at Trier57 the apostle is shown in the presence of Aegeas in one compartment, as in the German miniatures, but the incarceration is omitted. The third scene of the Freising miniature depicts the flagellation of the apostle; in the Trier triptych the audience with Aegeas is followed by two scenes in which St. Andrew cures the blind and preaches to the multitude, and in the Regensburg manuscript, he preaches to the people from prison. In each of these German examples variety is shown in the choice of compositions, whereas in the Catalan panel the arrangement and composition of the second episode is almost identical with the first. In fact, the figures of the enthroned Aegeas and the standing apostle in the lower compartment might have been copied line for line from the corresponding figures in the compartment above. This absence of variety demonstrates a surprising poverty of invention on the part of the Catalan artist. Of the historical scenes the crucifixion of St. Andrew was most frequently chosen for representation. This subject, however, does not appear during the Early Christian period, since on monuments prior to the ninth century the apostle is usually depicted devotionally, either as a bust or as a standing figure in a group composition with other saints, where he holds a scroll and wears the nimbus and apostolic costume.s8 In the 55.

It is also illustrated by Rohault de Fleury (Les saints de la messe et leurs monuments, Paris, 1900, X, pl. XLVI), where the ico- nography can be more easily studied than from the re- production published by von Falke and Frauberger. 58. Probably the earliest appearance of St. Andrew in Early Christian art where the figure is accompanied by his name inscribed in Greek letters is the fresco of the catacomb of Karmouz, Alexandria, now called the Wescher catacomb, which may date from the fourth century (Cabrol, op. cit., I, I, coll. 190 ff., 798, 1128, fig. 279). It is not certain, however, whether the in- scription is of the same date as the frescoes. Antonio Mufioz has identified St. Andrew in scenes from the life of Christ in the Codex Rossanensis (fol. I) (Antonio Mufioz, II codice purpureo de Rossano e ilframmento sinopense, Rome, 1906, p. 18; 0. von Gebhardt and A. Harnack, Evangeliorum codex graecus purpureus Ros- sanensis, 188o, p. XXXIII, pl.

In the East the body is clothed in a colobium, a long tunic with or without sleeves, as shown in the Homilies of St. Gregory of Nazianzus, of the ninth century,59 and the eleventh centuryVatican Menologium,60where the saint again hangs from a Latin cross. Occasionally the Eastern method of draping the body was followed in the West, as in the Prfim Gradual of the eleventh century (Fig.22), but the Western tradition is followed on our panel, where the saint is clothed only in a loin cloth. The Latin cross (crux immissa), which appears on our panel, is almost invariably found in scenes of the crucifixion of St. Andrew during the early Middle Ages. After the thirteenth century the Latin form was replaced by the transverse cross (crux decussata), also called the "Burgundian" or "St. Andrew's cross," which assumes the shape of an X.61 The transverse form appears on a few early monuments which depict the martyrdom of St. Andrew, such as an eleventh century French manuscript from Autun,62 where the artist has added a vertical bar between the arms of the transverse cross, giving it the appearance of a chrism, and it is also found in the twelfth century on a capital from St. Pons (Hirault), now at Montpellier (Fig. 24), which shows the martyrdom of St. Pons.63 In general iconographic usage, however, the Latin form pre- vailed until the end of the thirteenth century, not only in scenes of the martyrdom of the apostle but also in devotional works, where the saint usually holds a Latin cross,64 Loaves and Fishes, c. 500 (Garrucci, op. cit., VI, pl. 419/I); Nechanic, Bohemia, Schloss Hradek, Count Harrach Coll., on back of Ada group ivory, holds book and labarum, early ninth century, inscr.

A person dressed in a long bluish tunic, who probably represents Aegeas, stands on the right and converses with the saint, who is shown on a Latin cross; on the left at the back is a portico, and the apostle's name is written in Greek characters (Omont, Fac-similis des miniatures des plus anciens manuscrits grecs de la bibliothque na- tionale du VIe au XIe sic/le, Paris, i902, pl.

The crux decussata derives its name from its re- semblance to the decussis or sign of the numeral X, and it also recalls the letter X of the Greek alphabet. St. Jerome says: decussare est per medium secare, veluti si duae regulae concurrant ad speciem litterae X, quaefigura est crucis (Cabrol, op. cit., III, 2, col. 3061). 62.

A few other late thirteenth century examples of the transverse cross are illustrated by Fleury (op. cit., X, pl. XLIII, p. 47). St. Peter Chrysologus states that the apostle was fastened to a tree and it is this version which appears to be represented on the eleventh cen- tury bronze doors of the church of St. Paul's f.lm. at Rome (ibid., X, pl. V). 64. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries St. Andrew, either seated or standing, often holds a Latin cross. Typical examples are: Moissac, cloister, relief, c. IIoo (Fleury, op. cit., X, pl. L); Paris, Bibl. Nat., MS. lat. I 1 580, seated with a large Latin cross (ibid., X, pl.

The saint usually holds the Latin cross when shown on the fagades of northern cathedrals during the thirteenth century (Male, L'art religieux du XIIIe silcle, p. 363).

Cords are not employed in the ninth century examples (Drogo Sacramentary, Homilies of St. Gregory of Nazianzus) and nails are seen in the Vatican Menologium, but in the eleventh century Priim Gradual (Fig. 22), the Freising manuscript (Fig. 21), and on the Trier triptych the feet and hands are bound. In the Regensburg miniature (Fig. 25) two guards are shown in the act of bind- ing the apostle to the cross under the direction of Aegeas, who is enthroned at the right.66 On our panel Aegeas and the guards are omitted, but they are often present in other examples of the martyrdom. In the Homilies of St. Gregory of Nazianzus Aegeas is the only spectator and he appears to converse with the apostle, who hangs from the cross; in the Vatican Menologium and the Pruim Gradual (Fig. 22) a guard is also in- cluded, who stands on the opposite side. A detail which is not omitted by our artist is the light which came from heaven shortly before the death of St. Andrew. This is represented by a series of parallel wavy lines, which converge toward the arms of the cross. The rays of light are also depicted on the Trier triptych. The figure of the crucified St. Andrew on our panel was undoubtedly modeled after a contemporary work of art which depicted the crucifixion of the Saviour, such as a page from an illuminated manuscript or a crucifix of wood or enamel. Whenever the crucifixion is represented on Western monuments during the early Middle Ages the body of Christ is placed directly on the central axis, the body hangs stiffly in a vertical line and the knees do not bend. This is not only true of the earliest examples, such as the Drogo Sacramentary, the Pruim Gradual, and the Gerona Beatus, but persisted in western Europe during the eleventh century and the early years of the twelfth, as inscr.

Northern examples are illustrated by A. Lindblom (La peinture gothique en Sudde et en Nor- v0ge, p. 48, fig. 9; p. 102, pl. 32). In the devotional rep- resentations of the fourteenth century St. Andrew often leans on the transverse cross and holds the Gospel in the right hand. He is usually shown as an old man, often resembling St. Peter, with long flowing hair and beard. 66. Cf. Munich, Staatsbibliothek, Perikopenbuch von St. Erentrud, two attendants below tie the feet with rope and two others the arms, and two angels are also shown (Swarzenski, Salzburger Malerei, pl. LXII, fig. 200); Salzburg, Stiftsbibliothek St. Peter, anti- phonarium, two guards hold ends of the rope and a devil speaks into the ear of Aegeas (Lind, Antiphona- rium, pl. XXII, Swarzenski, op. cit., p. ix 5). For other examples of the crucifixion of St. Andrew see: Cologne, Maurinusschrein, signed work by Fredericus, c. 1i 8o (Von Falke, op. cit., pl. 44, p. 41); Siegburg, Westphalia (?), St. Andrew reliquary (ibid., pl. io6, pp. I12, 134); Vercelli, Italy, church of St. Andrew, tympanum (Mile, L'art religieux du XII sidcle, p. 274). Scenes from the life and acts of the apostle were represented on a tapes- try, dated 1145, now lost, which formerly existed in the abbey of St. Andrew at Worms (Fleury, op. cit., X p. 40).</page><page sequence="28">A Lb :3 "] ? .? .jr r....r i : I- S-.,4 -. -4 .~' Air ~ %AJMAA36 FIG. 20-Paris, Bibl.

I8v.), and an illuminated page at Vich.67 During the twelfth century, however, owing to French influence, greater naturalism in the treatment of the body was introduced. In the scene of the crucifixion of the thief on the top of the Arca Santa at Oviedo (Fig. 27), of the first half of the twelfth century, the body bends slightly at the waist and the left knee slightly overlaps the right. On Limoges enamels of the late twelfth or early thirteenth century (Fig. 28), this detente or asymmetrical treatment of the body is even more pronounced.Wherever, in fact, French influence penetrated during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries a more naturalistic rendering appears and in the full Gothic period this results in a heavily drooping head and an S-shaped body with knees bent at a sharp angle. On a thirteenth century Limoges crucifix at Vich the head is held erect and the eyes are open as in our panel. The knees on this enamel bend slightly but do not overlap. On other thirteenth century Limoges enamels (Fig. 28), however, the body shows a slight bend and the lines of the left leg, which slightly overlaps the right, have the same contour as the body of St. Andrew. The loin cloth worn by the apostle on our panel is longer on the right side of the body and shows a slight outward curve. The folds of the drapery are not clearly delineated but it is obvious that the Catalan artist has sought to reproduce a flying fold similar to that shown on the lower edge of the tunics on a twelfth century antependium in the Barcelona Museum.68 The death of Aegeas is frequently omitted from the St. Andrew cycle, but the scene appears in the Regensburg miniature, and it is interesting to compare the German with the Catalan version. The text merely states "ere that Aegeas was come again to his house, he was ravished with a devil by the way, and died tofore them all." In Fig. 25 the tyrant is seated on a throne, and two demons with furry, animal bodies sieze him by the throat and hair, whereas on our panel he is stabbed in the back. The devils are represented with human rather than animal bodies but the heads are depicted as repulsively as possible. Mediaeval devils and evil spirits are commonly represented with long locks, as shown by the two figures above the arms of the cross on the Arca Santa in Fig. 27, the dragon bound in the abyss by the angel in the Gerona Beatus, and the figure of Satan who tempts Christ in the Gerona Homilies of Bede. Both devils on our panel, as well as the guards who sieze the apostle in the two scenes on the left, are portrayed as subnormal creatures with receding foreheads, enormously long noses, and prognathous jaws.69 It is not unlikely that the artist has intended to portray Mos- lems, the traditional enemies of Christianity in Spain. The Adoration of the Cross by St. Andrew does not appear on this panel, although 67. T'he Art Bulletin, VI, 2, fig. 6. 68. Ibid., fig. I. 69. Didron, op. cit., II, p. Io8ff. The representation of guards and executioners as ugly, subnormal types can be well illustrated by an English psalter of the second half of the twelfth century, where we see the same large mouths, long noses, and huge jaws (Burlington Fine Arts Club, Exhibition of Illuminated Manuscripts, 1908 pl. 9).</page><page sequence="31">224 THE ART BULLETIN it is frequently represented in other St. Andrew cycles. "And when he was led unto the cross, there ran much people thither saying; The blood of the innocent is damned without cause. And the apostle prayed them that they should ~not empesh nor let his torment ne martyrdom. And when he saw the cross from afar he saluted it, and said: All hail cross which art dedicate in the body of Jesu Christ, and wert adorned with the members of him, as of precious stones. Tofore that our Lord ascended on thee, thou wert the power earthly, now thou art the love of heaven; thou shalt receive me by my desire. I come to thee surely and gladly as disciple of him that hung on thee. For I have always worshipped thee and have desired thee to embrace. O thou cross which hast received beauty and noblesse of the members of our Lord, whom I have so long desired and curiously loved, and whom my courage hath so much desired and coveted, take me from hence, and yield me to my master, to the end that he may receive me by thee."7o In the Drogo Sacramentary (Fig. 23) the apostle stands before an upright cross with hands bound and is followed by a group of spectators. In later versions he often kneels, as in the twelfth century Bible of Amiens, 71where he is shown on his knees and touches the cross with outstretched hands; in the Trier triptych72 he not only kneels but also embraces the cross, and from above appears the hand of God. Inasmuch as this panel is one of the earliest monuments of Spanish art to show the life and acts of St. Andrew it is an important document for the history of the cult of this Christian saint. He is represented on another antependium, belonging to the Espona Collection, as a devotional figure and his crucifixion is found on a thirteenth century altar-frontal in the Barcelona Museum. There is, however, no other Romanesque Span- ish panel on which so many scenes from his life are shown. His cult had long existed in Spain and as early as the seventh century his relics were revered in the Peninsula.73 His feast took place in villa farsil, near Cordova,74 and the Gothic missal assigns a complete mass to him. 75A church of St. Andrew existed in the seventh century at Cor- dova76 and in the later centuries several Mozarabic churches bore his name.77 He is the patron saint of Estella in Navarre, and Romanesque churches and chapels were dedi- 70.

Several parts of the mass, such as the preface and the collectio ad pacem, were taken from the Span- ish Acts or from the book of the miracles of St. Andrew, and he is also mentioned in the Liber Comicus. The Mozarabic liturgy also borrows freely from the Acts of the saint, especially in the Missa, Oratio, Illatio, and Post pridie (Cabrol, op. cit., I, 2, coll. 2033-2034). 76. Hiibner, I. H. C., p. 73. 77. One of the earliest preserved is the ninth century Asturian church of S. Andres de Bedrifiana (G6mez- Moreno, Iglesias Mozdrabes, p. 83). The church of S. Andr6s de Arguterio, province of Astorga, was men- tioned in 946, and the church of El Vierzo, a parish of Astorga, was constructed to receive the relics of St. Andrew, given by Alfonso III, who died in 91o. A par- ish church at Trobe, near Santiago de Compostela, contains the tomb of a bishop of Coimbra, who died in 912. A church of St. Andrew existed in the tenth cen- tury at Leon, and Madoz cites an ancient sanctuary in the province of Leon, founded by St. Gennadius in 896. At Toledo a Moorish mosque was transformed into a Christian church dedicated to the saint, which was burned in 1150 (Fleury, op. cit., X, pp. 42-43).</page><page sequence="32">JI , , CS-' FIG. 25-Munich, State Library: Page of Regensburg Manuscript *a ~-mf ?a -- f?nf.; ~ I i..; -tl F~ a r ~?x~ i; r~jj; 8 ii rl~ aiji? rfl i i \ Bn3 ?i i: i ._ I I-':t~f~f~lf "" r t. i i fic~t 5'fI~ ~I~ t.;r " Xj 1 P:~trsPlf I~C~F~~P ir"tT~i~~~"/ i- tt ? _4 i a ~ ~g~u ~ , ~c01 ~:e rrrart A : B .:.$ -?*?Y~~: ~- ?? ~I :aII ~~t P~ a~S %If iallcc~ tr :E I, ~ d ~lr~B gfa .~~i"llt i r3'- ; $ 9~ d " ~~ E' ~ j* 5 B B IO "i o r 1 It a a - in ri J a Irrr 1, I. 10~71 a f C' a ?$r~/ jilC~ A ~ B ?:if i m -~ f% -~tS E i i I i i (* ";?~47?1 lf~r,7i E~ Itl"-"P fi " iI U -r J-1 Q i t!"1 u f'f,_-s, t;lf~ C1 id; Cr ~:~?~;C~-z~,~?~?"~'M`;-vi;~iZti2\Uy/~I~ : FIG. 26-Munich, State Library: Page of Regensburg Manuscript</page><page sequence="33">4'," Z-77Y 41~ 'loo IAP Oltz 4 -114O41L 11 40 VIA 44 FIG. 27-Oviedo, Cathedral: Detail of Arca Santa (Photo.

The Greek church celebrated his feast (November 30) in the fourth century, after the re- moval of the apostle's body to the imperial basilica of the Holy Apostles at Constanti- nople,8, and a century later he was honored by the church of Rome. The first sanctu- ary dedicated to him in Italy was the basilica of Junius Bassus (c. 317) and at Ravenna St. Peter Chrysologus (433-450) constructed a monastery bearing the name of St. Andrew, who was represented in mosaic over the entrance.82 St. Gregory the Great, who converted his paternal home into a monastery of St. Andrew, also celebrated the apostle's martyrdom. He was widely revered in France,18 where he is the patron saint of Agde, Avranches, Bordeaux, and Burgundy;84 his cult spread early to the British Isles and Germany and he is the titular saint of Scotland and Russia.18 78. Loc. cit. 79- Sant Andreu de Sureda was mentioned in a docu- ment of 820-825, the monastery of Centelles, or Tres- ponts in 839, the church of Sant Andreu de la Greixa in 872, and the monastery of Sant Andreu d'Eixalada in 879. Later establishments dedicated to the apostle are the monastery of Sant Andreu de Plan's (993), Sant Andreu de Sagars, eleventh century, Sant Andreu de Laorto (I i15), Sant Andreu inter Pontons (I i15), Sant Andreu de la Manresana (1128) (Puig y Cadafalch, op. cit., II-III, passim). 80. He was a disciple of St. John the Baptist, whose testimony led him and John the Evangelist to follow Jesus. He was later chosen as one of the twelve apostles and was present at the miraculous feeding of the five thousand. He is not named in the acts except in the list of the apostles, where the order of the first four is Peter, John, James, Andrew. When the apostles went forth to preach the Gospel, Andrew took an important part. According to Nicephorus he preached in Cappadocia, Galatia, Bithynia, in the land of the anthropophagi, in the Scythian deserts, and later in Byzantium, Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, and Achaia. 81. At the capture of Constantinople by the French in the early thirteenth century the relics of St. Andrew were scattered. Many of them were brought to Italy by Cardinal Peter of Capua, who deposited them in the cathedral of Amalfi. 82. His name does not appear in the earliest church calendars. Pope Simplicius chose St. Andrew as patron for a new church at Rome and soon after this Sym- machus converted the Vestiarium Neronis into a basilica called Sancti Andreae ad Crucem. Another early build- ing in Rome which bore the apostle's name was a ro- tunda, employed as a mausoleum, which was attached to the Vatican. A monastery at Pistoia, founded in the eighth century, and another at Florence (c. 800) were dedicated to him. For a discussion of other foundations in Italy see Ch. Rohault de Fleury, Les saints de la messe et leurs monuments, Paris, 1900, X, pp. 3-16. 83. The cross of St. Andrew was brought to St.- Victor of Marseilles at the beginning of the fifth cen- tury by Stephen, king of the Burgundians, and a chapel was dedicated to him at Nantes from the year 404. For a discussion of the foundations in France, where there are more than a hundred basilicas which bear his name, see Fleury (op. cit., pp. 17-28). 84. When the relics of the apostle were dispersed after the capture of Constantinople in the thirteenth century all Christendom sought to obtain portions of them, which created a lively enthusiasm for the saint. Philip of Burgundy (1433), who obtained at great cost a portion of the precious relics, placed his new order of chivalry, the Order of the Golden Fleece under the pro- tection of this saint, and his knights wore as their badge the cross of St. Andrew. 85. St. Andrew was especially revered in England, where there are more than six hundred dedications to him, and his popularity surpasses even that of Sts. James, John, and Paul. Two of the earliest churches in England, Rochester cathedral and Hexham abbey, were dedicated to St. Andrew. Rochester cathedral was dedi- cated by St. Augustine, who came to England on his mission from the monastery of St. Andrew on the Cae- lian hill at Rome, and the monastery of Hexham was consecrated by St. Wilfred (674). See also Fleury (op. cit., X, pp. 29-34). The abbey of St. Andrew at Worms existed from the eighth century; the church of St.Andrew at Hildes- helm from the tenth century, and the Empress Ade- laide founded a convent (992-994) under the Benedictine rule which bore his name. He is the patron of entire</page><page sequence="35">228 THE ART BULLETIN Many archaistic or retardataire features have been noted in the style of this panel, but the date is fairly well advanced. The figures in the side compartments wear short tunics cut high above the knees, or long robes which fall in heavy, straight folds to the feet. These drapery mannerisms, together with the lack of movement and the angular treatment of the folds around the feet, are found on earlier Spanish monuments. The tunic with wide sleeves and the mantle of the Saviour in the central compartment sug- gest analogies with Limoges enamels, and we have noted the close resemblance in style between the body and the drapery of St. Andrew on the cross and the Limoges cruci- fixes of the thirteenth century. The scene of the martyrdom on our panel is probably earlier than that shown on the enamels, but in view of the palaeography, especially the forms of the letters A, D, E, G in the inscription, our altar-frontal should be dated no earlier than 1200. (9) THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT PANEL FROM SAGARS The first of the fragmentary side panels which formerly hung with the St. Andrew antependium from Sagars and are now in the Episcopal Museum at Solsona represents in two registers a scene from Genesis and the Passion of Christ (Fig. 29).86 The upper register shows the Fall of Man in one compartment and in the adjoining compartment the Betrayal of Christ and the Descent from the Cross; the lower register contains the Entry into Jerusalem. In the upper left compartment Adam and Eve stand on either side of the Tree of Knowledge. Eve, on the left, takes the fruit from the mouth of the serpent; Adam, on the right, gazes at the serpent and strokes his beard with his right hand. Both have red hair, are nude, and cover themselves with green fig leaves. The tree and serpent are green. In the scene of the Betrayal two guards, clad in short green tunics, hold the arms of the Saviour, and Judas, approaching from behind, kisses Him on the cheek. Two ad- ditional figures, apparently guards, stand in the background. Christ wears a crossed nimbus and long white tunic underneath an orange-red mantle. The guard on the right wears a conical green cap. In the Descent from the Cross Joseph of Arimathaea stands on the left and supports provinces, such as Schleswig-Holstein and Luxembourg (ibid., pp. 36-40). His relics are still preserved in a tenth century portable altar, work of the Egbert ate- lier (977-993),now at Trier (Von Falke, op. cit., pp. 8, 124, pl. 5; Fleury, op. cit., X, pl. XLVI). Relics of the saint were brought to Scotland in the fourth century and he is the patron saint of its chief order of knighthood. The Russians believe that St. Andrew was the first to preach to the Muscovites, and the chief order of Russia, the Cross of St. Andrew, was founded by Peter the Great in the year 1698. 86. Solsona, Episcopal Museum, no. 2; tempera on panel; 0.825 x 0.945 m.; photograph by Arxiv "Mas," no. 5737 C. The ends of the panel have been cut and a square piece is missing from the lower right corner. The ornament on the lower frame is in poor condition but otherwise the drawing is well preserved. This side panel, together with the companion piece showing scenes from the life of the Virgin, was found, as stated at the be- gining of this article, in the church at Sagars by Dr. Jaume Serra i Vilar6. Munioz erroneously states that both side panels are now at Vich and that they came from the town of Cardona (Antonio Mufioz, Pittura romanica catalana, I paliotti dipinti dei Musei di Vich e di Barcellona, in Institut d'Estudis Catalans, Anuari, Barcelona, 1907, I, p. 112, fig. 18).</page><page sequence="36">g:: '' pi Pr""" ~ -?

The head, encircled by a crossed nimbus with white dots, droops low and rests on Joseph's head, and the free right arm of the Saviour lies limply across his right shoulder. The body is nude with the exception of an orange-red loin cloth reaching to the knees. Nicodemus, on the right, extracts the nail from the left hand with a long pair of pincers. Joseph wears a light green tunic and orange-red hose and Nicodemus a dark green tunic with orange sleeves. All three figures are bearded. The cross is red and above the Saviour's head the anagram I H S is inscribed in white letters. The right side of the panel has been cut and nothing remains of the scene adja- cent to the Descent from the Cross except the end of a green sarcophagus which was supported by short columns. The position indicates that the missing scene was the Entombment of the Saviour. The scene shown originally directly beneath the Entomb- ment in the lower register has also been lost, but it is highly probable that it repre- sented the Three Maries at the Tomb. The green object which can still be seen on the lower right corner resembles the spiral joint of an angel's wing. The angel must have faced toward the right and the Three Maries were probably represented as approach- ing from the extreme right. The remaining section of the lower register contains the Entry into Jerusalem. The Saviour, bearded and wearing a crossed orange nimbus, rides astride. He is clad in a green tunic and an orange-red mantle which is looped up over the right arm. He holds the reins in the left hand and does not make the usual sign of the benediction with the right. The foal walks slightly in advance of the dark green ass. A beardless figure, dressed in a short green tunic, holds by the sleeve an orange-red tunic, which he throws under the feet of the ass. Directly behind this figure stand a group of seven people, two of whom are bearded and wear tall green caps. The city of Jerusalem with crenelated towers and open portal is shown on the extreme left. Outside the city walls appear the busts of two spectators, one of whom wears a pointed green cap. The ornament of this panel shows many analogies with that of the antependium from the front of the altar. The plain neutral brown backgrounds are treated in the second and third compartments with a series of straight lines, alternating with wavy lines. This is similar to that found on the lateral scenes of the St. Andrew antependium (Figs. 3-6) and appears on other antependia as well as in Catalan manuscripts.87 The inter- rupted spiral rope pattern, which surrounds and separates the individual scenes, is also similar to that shown on the frame of the preceding work. Inasmuch as this panel was placed at the side of the altar the frame was omitted at both ends. The top and bottom, however, have the conventional frame, the bevel of which is painted dark brown. The foliate ornament on the surface of the frame, which is similar at top and bottom, con- sists of a series of acanthus palmettes enclosed within tangent medallions. The lower 87.

The dif- ferent elements of the acanthus pattern are painted in alternate colors of orange, red, green, and white, and white bands bind together the continuous series of tangent medallions. On the left end of the frame the stems of the acanthus, which grow outside the medallion, point upward, and on the right side the motif is reversed and the stems point downward. This disposition of the design is useful since it enables us to deter- mine how much of the panel has been cut away on the right side. The original length of the panel can be estimated as approximately I.Io meters, and this clearly shows that not more than one scene in each register has been lost. Close similarities with the St. Andrew antependium are also shown in the figure style. There is the same lack of characterization in the faces. Christ is always depicted with a red beard, and all the figures have red hair which frequently ends above the shoulders in a curl. The limitations of the artist are revealed by the awkward render- ing of the human figure: the attitudes are stiff, the legs and arms are not well articu- lated and the knees are shaky. All the figures lack weight and equilibrium. In the De- scent from the Cross Nicodemus looks upward but his head is turned to one side at an angle of ninety degrees. The guard who seizes Christ in the scene of the Betrayal has the same ugly features as those of the guards in the preceding work and there is the same treatment of the eye, which is drawn in full face on a head shown in profile. The anatomical rendering of the ass and foal are equally unnatural; they are lifeless and stand like stuffed toy animals or cardboard silhouettes. The drapery style also is similar to that of the altar-frontal. The tunic and mantle of Christ in the scene of the Betrayal is worn in the same manner as that of St. Andrew in the two scenes in which the apostle appears before Aegeas. With the exception of Adam and Eve and Christ, all the figures wear the same type of short tunic with long sleeves, hose and sandals. The hose which are worn like puttees, wound with cords or straps (correas), are found on other Romanesque monuments and are an inheritance from the Visigothic and Mozarabic period.88 The pointed green cap, worn by some of the figures, is similar in shape to that worn by the jailer who blows the oliphant in the preceding panel. This type of headdress may possibly be a late survival of the Phrygian cap found on Early Christian monuments. It is similar in shape to the national Catalan cap which is still worn by the peasants of eastern Spain, but the artist has undoubtedly intended to reproduce here only the conical helmets which were common in Europe during the Romanesque period. (IO) THE VIRGIN PANEL FROM SAGARS The second of the side panels which formerly hung with the St. Andrew altar-frontal from Sagars represents in two registers five scenes from the life of the Virgin (Fig.30),89 88.

Originally the upper register contained the Annuncia- tion, the Visitation, and the Nativity; and in the lower register were the Magi before Herod and the Adoration of the Magi. The Annunciation was shown in the upper left compartment, but more than half the scene has been lost. The Virgin stands on the right, with one hand held against her breast and the other outstretched toward the angel Gabriel, now missing. She wears a dark green mantle and an orange-red gown and headdress of the same color. The green halo is decorated with a wavy yellow line. From a dark green cloud in the upper right corner issues the head of an angel, who is represented with red hair and an orange nim- bus. The background of this compartment, as shown by the others, originally contained alternate red and yellow squares. In the scene of the Visitation the Virgin and Elizabeth are shown directly on the central axis, with arms about each other's necks. One of the women, on the left, wears an orange dress and dark green mantle which envelops the head, the other, a green dress and orange mantle. In the Nativity the Virgin lies on a high, four-poster bed, and is completely covered by a large, blue-green robe with an orange border. She wears a white headdress and has no nimbus. The two-year-old Child, placed directly above on a-small cot, with no visible means of support, is depicted with red hair and a yellow crossed nimbus. He is wrapped in an orange robe, and above the cot appear the heads of the ox and ass. Joseph, seated on the right, leans his head on his left hand. He-is represented with a beard, long pale green hair, and a dark green tunic. Above his head an angel with white wings and an orange nimbus issues from a cloud. Owing to the mutilation of the left side of the panel nothing remains of the left scene of the lower register except the head and shoulders of a guard. Inasmuch as the guard adjoins the other Magi it is highly probable that the missing scene portrayed the Three Magi before Herod. The guard is shown with brown hair and beard and wears an orange tunic. He holds a spear with both hands and looks backward over his right shoulder. The remaining section of the lower register is occupied with the Adoration of the Magi. The Virgin, shown in a strictly frontal position on the extreme right is seated on a high throne with a bolster. She wears a white nimbus, orange headdress and tunic, and a dark green mantle which terminates at the bottom in large folds. Between her knees she holds the Saviour, who blesses with the right hand and holds a Book of the Gospels in the left. He is depicted with a crossed nimbus, the crosses of which are red, and is clad in a white tunic and green mantle. A large miraculous star is placed directly above the Virgin's right shoulder. The Three Magi approach on the left in single file. The first two are bearded and carry large vases in veiled hands; the third is beardless 5738 C. The panel has been cut and a square piece is missing from the lower left corner.

The first figure is clad in a long orange tunic or notched chiton, a green mantle, and orange hose wrapped around the legs like spiral puttees. He has dark red hair and beard and carries a white vase. The second is dressed exactly like the first except that the mantle and crown are orange-red and the tunic and vase are green. The lower part of the third figure is missing but the head and shoulders are intact. He wears a dark green crown, a green mantle, and orange tunic. The ornament is clearly similar to that of the St. Andrew altar-frontal, where we have already noted the same checkerboard background of alternate red and yellow rec- tangles. The division of the composition into compartments by means of an interrupted spiral rope pattern is similar to that found in Fig. 29 and like the preceding panel a wide frame is shown at the top and bottom, the bevel of which is dark red. The sur- face of the frame is embellished with a white foliate scroll on a dark red ground. This is bordered on either side by narrow violet stripes with a wavy red line and green stripes with a row of white dots. The style of this panel is identical with that of the two preceding works, where we find figures with the same short stature. The feminine costume, with long tunic and mantle covering the head, is analogous to that shown in the St. Andrew altar-frontal. The guard in the scene of the Magi before Herod has the same standing hair and ugly features which we have already noted in the previous two panels, and the Magi are represented with the same red beard and long hair ending in a curl above the shoulders. In fact, the close similarity in color, ornament, figure and drapery style show clearly that all three panels from the church of Sagars were executed by the same artist. That artist, as we have concluded above, could have done the work no earlier than 1200.</page></plain_text>
