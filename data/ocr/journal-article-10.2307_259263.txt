GIOIA Pennsylvania State University MAJKEN SCHULTZ Copenhagen Business School KEVIN G. CORLEY Pennsylvania State University Organizational identity usually is portrayed as that which is core, distinctive, and enduring about the character of an organization. We argue that because of the reciprocal interrelationships between identity and image, organizational identity, rather than enduring, is better viewed as a relatively fluid and unstable concept. We further argue that instead of destabilizing an organization, this instability in identity is actually adaptive in accomplishing change. The analysis leads to some provoca- tive, but nonetheless constructive, implications for theory, research. and practice. In recent years identity and image have be- come the subjects of rather intensive organiza- tional study, perhaps because both concepts are multilevel notions dealing with individual and organizational issues and because both can lend insight into the character and behavior of organizations and their members. Whether those insights concern personal versus organi- zational identity (Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1989), threats to identity (Elsbach &amp; Kramer, 1996), organiza- tional image and identification (Dutton, Duk- erich, &amp; Harquail, 1994), organizational image as an end state (Alvesson, 1990), adaptation (Dutton &amp; Dukerich, 1991), issue interpretation (Gioia &amp; Thomas, 1996), or member commitment (Whet- ten, Lewis, &amp; Mischel, 1992), identity and image have acquired the status of key concepts em- ployed to describe and explain individual and organizational behavior (see Whetten &amp; God- frey, 1998). In this article we focus attention pri- marily on the concepts of organizational identity and image. Essential to most theoretical and empirical treatments of organizational identity is a view, specified by Albert and Whetten (1985), defining identity as that which is central, enduring, and distinctive about an organization's character. Scholars have predicated virtually all later treatments of organizational identity on these definitional pillars. In contrast, scholars have seen organizational image as a broader con- cept, which includes notions involving the ways organization members believe others see the or- ganization (Dutton &amp; Dukerich, 1991); fabricated, projected pictures aimed at various constituen- cies (Bernstein, 1984); and the public's percep- tion of a given organization (Berg, 1985). In this article we argue that there is a close reciprocal relationship between organizational identity and various forms of image-a relation- ship that augurs for some reconsideration of the bases for the normally accepted conception of identity. We argue further that this reconsidera- tion is important, because the consequences of adhering to the now taken-for-granted concep- tion have implications not only for our ways of thinking about organizations and their members but especially for the ways in which we think about how organizations change. This is partic- ularly the case as organizations deal with in- creasingly complex and turbulent environments and as the role of the media in organizational life becomes more pronounced. Our main contention is that organizational identity, contrary to most treatments of it in the literature, is actually relatively dynamic and We thank Samia Chreim, AMR special issue editor Jane Dutton, Martin Kilduff, Kristian Kreiner, Dave Lepak, Mette Morsing, Gary Weaver, and three anonymous AMR review- ers for constructive comments on earlier versions of this article. 63</page><page sequence="2">64 Academy of Management Review January that the apparent durability of identity is some- what illusory. We argue that the seeming dura- bility of identity is actually contained in the stability of the labels used by organization members to express who or what they believe the organization to be, but that the meaning associated with these labels changes so that identity actually is mutable. Therefore, we re- conceptualize organizational identity as a po- tentially precarious and unstable notion, fre- quently up for redefinition and revision by organization members. We argue that the insta- bility of identity arises mainly from its ongoing interrelationships with organizational image, which are clearly characterized by a notable degree of fluidity. Perhaps most important, we argue further that the instability of identity is actually adaptive in facilitating organizational change in response to environmental demands. Although in recent theory and research on or- ganizational identity one finds acknowledg- ment of its potentially changeable character (see the conversations in Whetten &amp; Godfrey, 1998), scholars continue to downplay, underplay, or inadequately develop the implications of re- conceptualizing identity as dynamic. Certainly, the presumption of stability has allowed re- searchers to more easily develop measures of an organization's identity, but we have come to a point in the theoretical development of the concept at which we need to account for its dynamism. We first offer a brief exploration of the nature of organizational identity by weaving together multiple views from the literature; we then offer an overview of multiple forms of organizational image, followed by a description of the interre- lationships between identity and image. We de- velop a depiction of the processes by which identity becomes unstable and mutable be- cause of its complex interrelationships with im- age. Our initial approach to this depiction has its roots in realist ontological assumptions (i.e., it presumes some substantive basis for identity), suggesting a view of identity as changing incre- mentally. We then invoke several alternative views that not only help to produce an en- hanced, multiperspective understanding of the nature of identity (Gioia &amp; Pitre, 1990; Schultz and Hatch, 1996) but also serve to clarify and dramatize the degree to which identity can be- come malleable. These two alternative perspec- tives (a revisionist history view and a postmod- ern view) are predicated on nominalist ontological assumptions (i.e., they presume that identity is a subjective, socially constructed phenomenon). Taken together, these three perspectives lead to some provocative implications for our concep- tualization of identity-implications that moti- vate a constructive attempt to reconcile a seem- ing paradox concerning the relationship of organizations and their environments. On the one hand, the creation and maintenance of an apparently enduring identity are essential to long-term success (Albert &amp; Whetten, 1985; Col- lins &amp; Porras, 1994); on the other hand, organiza- tions must possess the ability to adapt quickly to increasingly turbulent environments as an essential condition for well-being and even sur- vival (Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997; D'Aveni, 1994; Eisenhardt, 1989; Gustafson &amp; Reger, 1995). Given the preference for order and stability in light of the need for change, one might thus reason that organizations must learn to change and yet somehow stay the same (cf. Gagliardi, 1986). Through the concept of "adaptive instabil- ity," we provide an alternative reading on change in modern organizations that demon- strates that existence within this paradox is pos- sible and that, in fact, organizations can accom- plish change despite implied threats to the ostensibly enduring nature of their identities. The result of our analysis is a heightening of the sense that identity and image are indeed key notions but that these concepts and their inter- play are much more complex and elusive than current treatments would cast them. ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY Organizational identity is typically taken by scholars to be an organization's members' col- lective understanding of the features presumed to be central and relatively permanent, and that distinguish the organization from other organi- zations (Albert &amp; Whetten, 1985). Core features of identity are presumed to be resistant to ephem- eral or faddish attempts at alteration because of their ties to the organization's history. Gagliardi argues that the main strategy of an organization is usually geared to maintaining its identity, perhaps especially under threatening condi- tions of change (although he also notes that organizations "usually change to remain what they have always been ... [they] must change in</page><page sequence="3">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 65 order to preserve identity" [1986: 124-125]). Yet, this paradoxical statement nonetheless sug- gests that identity is not, and indeed cannot be, enduring in any strict sense, even though it ap- parently retains continuity in its essential fea- tures. There must be fluidity to the notion; oth- erwise, the organization stagnates in the face of an inevitably changing environment. In examining the fluid nature of identity, it is useful to differentiate between an enduring identity and an identity having continuity. Whereas Ashforth and Mael (1996) see the two concepts as synonymous, we believe the differ- ence is subtle, yet theoretically important. The notion of an identity that is enduring implies that identity remains the same over time-that it has some permanency. An identity with a sense of continuity, however, is one that shifts in its interpretation and meaning while retaining la- bels for "core" beliefs and values that extend over time and context. Identity is imputed from expressed values, but the interpretation of those values is not neces- sarily fixed or stable. Interpretations change, so invocations like "We stand for service!" or "We are an innovating company" mean different things to different groups at different times. There is a reassuring continuity for members (and also for interested external constituents) in saying that their mission or central values stay the same, but the representations and transla- tions into action take different forms over time. Thus, even though the core appears stable, it is effectively in flux because of its practical ambi- guity (allowing for flexible interpretations; see Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991) and its complexity (allowing a repertoire of values to fit many in- stances; see Reger, Gustafson, DeMarie, &amp; Mul- lane, 1994). A continuous feature of Hewlett- Packard's identity for many decades, for instance, has been based on the idea of the "H-P Way" as an expression of core values. Yet, the meaning of the specific values and actions as- sociated with the "H-P Way" has changed many times over the years (see Collins &amp; Porras, 1994), to arrive at its current form of elaboration (see www.hp.com). It is also important to recognize that identity, even at the individual level, is a social construc- tion (Gergen &amp; Davis, 1985), deriving from re- peated interactions with others (Cooley, 1902). This feature of identity has been at the heart of most theory and research on social and individ- ual identity (Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1995; Ash- forth &amp; Mael, 1996). For instance, James, as long ago as 1918, noted that people have markedly different identities for different roles and situa- tions. As Weick puts it, "Identities are consti- tuted out of the process of interaction. To shift among interactions is to shift among definitions of the self" (1995: 20). Similarly, Giddens (1991) noted that self-identity presumes reflexive awareness over time (i.e., identity must be ac- tively created and sustained through interac- tions with others). Thus, a sense of continuous formulation and preservation of the self through interaction is essential to notions of individual identity. This is an important recognition not only for individ- uals but also for organizations, because organ- izational identity is constructed via similar pro- cesses of interaction with outsiders-for instance, customers, media, rivals, and regula- tory institutions (cf. Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1996; Berg &amp; Gagliardi, 1985; Fombrun, 1996; Gioia, 1998). As Fiol states in her anthropomorphic example of an acute care teaching hospital undergoing change in its identity, "You can no longer ask only me or look inside of me to understand my identity. You can also no longer take a single snapshot of me at one point in time and believe you have captured my identity" (1998: 68). All of these views of organizational identity suggest that it is not only a complex phenome- non but also one that can vary with the context for which it is expressed (Fiol, Hatch, &amp; Golden- Biddle, 1998; Wilkins, 1989). A sense of continuity in the self-interpretation of an organization in relation to its environment might prevail, but identity is nonetheless inherently dynamic. Such observations raise questions about the typically assumed durability of identity-an as- sumption that becomes more problematic when we consider the concept of organizational image and its relationships with identity. ORGANIZATIONAL IMAGE Organizational image has been the subject of many different conceptualizations and defini- tional debates. Dutton and Dukerich (1991) ar- gued that organizational image is the way or- ganization members believe others view the organization (although Dutton et al., 1994, appro- priately relabeled this particular definition of image construed external image). Whetten et al.</page><page sequence="4">66 Academy of Management Review January (1992) took some issue with this definition and argued instead for defining image as the way "organizational elites" would like outsiders to see the organization. This orientation highlights top management's concern with projecting an image of the organization that is based (ideally) on identity. Such a "projected image" could be a bona fide attempt to represent essential fea- tures of organizational identity to others. It could also take the form of the projection of a desired future image (Gioia &amp; Thomas, 1996) that com- municates to insiders and outsiders a vision to be achieved. Projected image, however, might also encom- pass attempts to convey a socially desirable, managed impression that emphasizes selected aspects of identity; it could even conceal or mis- represent identity. In fact, Bernstein (1984) held that image should be defined as a construction of public impressions created to appeal to an audience (and not necessarily the attempt to represent some ostensible reality). All these views, however, take image to be essentially an internal conception-that is, perceptions held or communicated by insiders. Berg (1985) took a decidedly more external ap- proach by focusing on perceptions held by out- siders. He defined image as the public's percep- tion or impression of an organization, usually associated with a given action or event (which we term an external transient impression). This definition is related to Fombrun's (1996) defini- tion of reputation as the collective judgments (by outsiders) of an organization's actions and achievements. Reputation can be distinguished from transient impressions in that the concept of reputation implies a more lasting, cumulative, and global assessment rendered over a longer time period; transient impressions concern more limited and/or ephemeral events. To further complicate the conceptualization of image and its relationship with identity, in other disciplines scholars treat the notions of image and identity somewhat differently from those in the field of organizational study. In the fields of public relations and marketing, for instance, re- searchers employ the concepts of corporate identity, corporate image, and image manage- ment in their attempts to understand a corpora- tion's relationship with its constituents (Brown &amp; Cox, 1997; Grunig, 1993; Van Riel &amp; Balmer, 1997). Corporate identity (actually, a form of projected image, despite the label) scholars focus on how the "central idea" of a corporation is presented to its various constituents to achieve the corpo- ration's strategic goals (Olins, 1995). Those in the corporate identity field are most concerned with visual representations of the corporation emphasized through the design and manage- ment of corporate symbols and logos (Hatch &amp; Schultz, 1997; Olins, 1989). Although the concept of corporate identity is closely related to Bern- stein's (1984) conception of a projected image, in recent work on corporate identity, van Riel and Balmer (1997) and Hatch and Schultz (1997) argue that projection of identity is equally important to both internal and external constituents. Pro- jected images, however, might be differentiated from corporate identity in that projected images typically are associated with specific contexts, events, issues, and audiences; corporate iden- tity usually is taken to include all verbal, graphic, and symbolic representations used by a company in its managed, corporate-level com- munication with various constituents. We have summarized these multiple-some- times overlapping and even conflicting-forms of image in Table 1. These differing notions sug- gest that image is a wide-ranging concept con- noting perceptions that are both internal and external to the organization (see also Boorstin, 1961), as well as perceptions that are both pro- jected and received. In fact, Grunig usefully ex- plicates such divergent perspectives by making a distinction between image "as something that a communicator creates- constructs and projects or gives to other people ... a message produced by the organization" (1993: 126) and an alternative notion of image wherein "receivers construct meaning-images-from their per- sonal observations of reality or from the sym- bols given to them by other people ... image as some sort of composite in the minds of publics" (1993: 126). We next employ these various forms of image to provide a theoretical description of the pro- cesses by which identity and image are interre- lated. These interrelationships (which we present in narrative form but also represent graphically as a dynamic process model) strongly suggest the fluidity of identity. Follow- ing the presentation of this process model, we bring the revisionist history and postmodern perspectives to bear on the question of how im- age and identity are interrelated, and we ex-</page><page sequence="5">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 67 TABLE 1 Forms of Image Label Definition in Literature Representative Examples Construed external image Organization members' perceptions of how Dutton &amp; Dukerich (1991) outsiders perceive the organization Dutton, Dukerich, &amp; Harquail (1994) Projected image Image created by an organization to be Alvesson (1990) communicated to constituents; might or Bernstein (1984) might not represent ostensible reality; singular image of the organization Desired future image Visionary perception the organization Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi (1991) would like external others and internal Gioia &amp; Thomas (1996) members to have of the organization sometime in the future Corporate identity Consistent and targeted representations of Olins (1989) the corporation emphasized through the van Riel &amp; Balmer (1997) management of corporate symbols and logos; strategically planned and opera- tionally applied internal and external self -representation Transient impression Short-term impression constructed by a Berg (1985) receiver either through direct Grunig (1993) observation or interpretation of symbols provided by an organization Reputation Relatively stable, long-term, collective Fombrun (1996) judgments by outsiders of an Fombrun &amp; Shanley (1990) organization's actions and achievements plore the consequences for the reconceptualiza- tion of identity. IDENTITY-IMAGE INTERRELATIONSHIPS Image in its multiple guises provides a cata- lyst for members' reflexive examination of their organizational self-definition. Image often acts as a destabilizing force on identity, frequently requiring members to revisit and reconstruct their organizational sense of self. To examine the processes by which identity becomes inter- related with, and susceptible to, the influence of image, we begin with the assumption that or- ganization members (especially top manage- ment members) have developed some sense of "who we are as an organization" (Albert &amp; Whet- ten, 1985) and have communicated that identity to internal and external constituencies. Over time, organization members receive feedback about their organizational portrayal, or some event occurs that makes identity concerns sa- lient (cf. Dutton &amp; Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach &amp; Kramer, 1996). Because organization members are simultaneously also members of external groups (e.g., as customers, as members of spe- cial-interest groups monitoring the organiza- tion's actions, or simply as audiences for media portrayals of their company), and thus sensi- tized to outsider views of their own organization, the tendency to compare their views of their organization with others' views of the organiza- tion is heightened further (Hatch &amp; Schultz, 1997). Shell Oil's experience with the burgeoning controversy over its plan to dispose of the mam- moth Brent Spar offshore storage and loading platform by sinking it in the Atlantic provides a good example of these processes in action. The original plan was opposed by Greenpeace, and eventually by national governments in northern Europe, as environmentally unsound. The con- troversy and negative feedback not only influ- enced Shell ultimately to reconsider and revise its plan but also to reconsider its own identity. Shell asked ca series of self-reflective questions, prompted by the images it projected to the pub- lic and the images conveyed in return in revis-</page><page sequence="6">68 Academy of Management Review January ing its identity to that of a more socially respon- sible business practitioner (see www.shellexpro. brentspar.com for a detailed corporate report). Figure 1 presents a skeletal depiction of the processes by which various forms of image are likely to destabilize and foster changes in iden- tity. As is the case with most process frame- works, however, Figure 1 presents a distilled, somewhat sterile, and even overly rational de- piction of a process that is, in actuality, a richer, more complex, more subtle, and often more tacit process. Within this simplified theoretical por- trayal, we have included several representative questions as a way of highlighting and illustrat- ing some of the key comparisons that members make between identity and image. Wnen information from outsiders conveys an unexpected transient impression (Berg, 1985; Grunig, 1993) or reputation (Fombrun, 1996), or- ganization members are prompted to compare their identity and image. Who we believe our- selves to be as an organization is partly based on how others see us (cf. Cooley, 1902; Gergen &amp; Davis, 1985), so feedback from outsiders con- cerning the impression we are making on them prompts us to look at our own sense of self and to assess the similarity of the two views. This assessment specifically involves an explicit or implicit comparison between identity and con- strued external image (Dutton et al., 1994). Rhe- torically, the comparison might be framed in terms of Albert and Whetten's fundamental self- reflective question, "Who are we as an organi- zation?" (although it is theoretically more re- vealing to cast the question as "Who do we think we are?" or even "Who do we think we should be?"), and the parallel other-reflective ques- tions, "Who do they think we are" and "Who do they think we should be" (see Dutton &amp; Dukerich, 1991, for a classic example). If the outcome of this comparison is a sense that there is no discrepancy between the two perceptions-that the way "we see ourselves" corresponds with how "others see us"-then identity is affirmed, and no apparent need for change exists. This was Shell's initial response after receiving approval from the British govern- ment to sink the Brent Spar in the North Atlantic. If this comparison, however, results in a sense that the way "we see ourselves" is inconsistent with how we think "others see us" (i.e., there is a discrepancy between identity and construed ex- ternal image), then several implicit or explicit questions arise (e.g., "Should we be concerned about this mismatch in perceptions?" "Do we need to take action to resolve the discrepan- cy?"). One possibility is that organization mem- bers will see the discrepancy as acceptable or not worthy of the effort needed to reconcile the differing perceptions (e.g., negative feedback from a stakeholder group not deemed important to the organization's self-definition or mission); they might therefore elect to do nothing ("We can live with it"), with no further considerations or implications for identity, which was Shell's early response to Greenpeace's objections. Alternatively, however, the discrepancy could be seen as important by top management and a decision made to take some action to resolve it. This occurred at Shell after Greenpeace occu- pied the Brent Spar, leading to widespread me- dia attention, public awareness, and objection by the German government. Such a decision suggests two major options: (1) change some- thing about the way we see ourselves (i.e., change aspects of our identity) or (2) attempt to change the way others perceive us (i.e., change others' external impression/reputation). If the discrepancy is pronounced and consequential, it can suggest the need to reevaluate and change aspects of identity, which ultimately occurred at Shell. Because direct interventions or exhorta- tions to members to alter their conceptions of the organization are unlikely to be effective (Reger et al., 1994), a viable alternative for top manage- ment is to project an attractive vision in the form of a desired future image as a precursor to a hoped-for future identity. For instance, Shell cre- ated websites and published a set of revised guiding principles, the Report to Society, por- traying itself as not only technically competent but also as socially sensitive. Such desired fu- ture images can serve to "pull" identity into sub- sequent alignment (Gioia &amp; Thomas, 1996). A public declaration of that future image also can signal to outsiders that the organization is changing; thus, the projection of a compelling future image can directly affect both identity and construed external image, as well as exter- nal perceptions of the organization (Figure 1). If top management members decide, however, that the identity-image discrepancy should be resolved instead by attempting to change how outsiders perceive the organization ("We need to get them to see us the way we would like"), they can attempt several tactics. First, they can</page><page sequence="7">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 69 FIGURE 1 Process Model of Identity-Image Interdependence _- - - Triggering external -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - feedback or event Identity/image comparison Identity Construed external image Questions of self-reflection Questions of other-reflection Who do we think we are?

Such an attempt at strategically altering images of the organization to better communicate the or- ganization's sense of identity-a central func- tion of an organization's corporate identity pro- gram-is aimed at influencing outsiders' perceptions to be better aligned with self- definitions. Shell's initial response to the nega- tive publicity, for instance, involved numerous corporate identity efforts aimed at helping out- siders see who the "real Shell" was. Second, top management members can project images aimed not at better communicat- ing identity but at highlighting and emphasiz- ing certain socially desirable aspects of their identity, thus attempting to manipulate outsider perceptions by engaging in organizational im- pression management. For example, Shell pro- jected images aimed at highlighting its engi- neering identity and scientific prowess, as well as calling repeated attention to its core princi- ples. Last, in the extreme, the organization can project patently false images in an attempt to misrepresent the organization to its publics. In the Brent Spar case, Shell did not make a con- certed effort to misrepresent itself to external audiences. In an interesting twist, however, Greenpeace-Shell's original protagonist in the conflict-did supply misinformation to the me- dia in an attempt to misrepresent Shell's image. This misinformation concerning the alleged vol- ume and toxicity of the Brent Spar's contents was eventually refuted, enabling Shell to regain credibility. Regardless of the initial purpose of the pro- jected images, however, outsiders develop their own images (transient impressions) of the or- ganization from their idiosyncratic interpreta- tions and from other available information ob- tained from media sources and other agents (Fombrun &amp; Shanley, 1990). Thus, organization- ally projected images are likely to have more indirect effects via subsequent feedback to the organization, depending on how the constituen- cies and other intermediaries interpret them. In some cases the external audience might indeed affirm the organization's image projection. More likely, however, is some alteration of the pro- jected image as intermediaries transmit, distort, add to, and otherwise modify it (into a refracted image, in Rindova &amp; Fombrun's, 1998, terms) so that the identity/image comparison process re- curs anew in cyclical fashion. For example, Shell launched a series of conversations with public constituencies-a process that prompted repeated reflection within Shell over the life of the Brent Spar saga (1991-1999). It is important to note that either in trying to change identity or in trying to change others' perceptions, an organization's projection of some altered image for the consumption of in- siders and/or outsiders is likely to influence and alter subsequent conceptions of identity be- cause of the close relationships between image and identity. Even the projection of an intention- ally false image arguably can influence later conceptions of identity. The essence of this as- pect of the process is that projected images are received, given their own interpretations by con- stituents and intermediaries, and fed back to the organization, often in modified form, which sub- sequently affects insider perceptions of their own identity (connoted by the feedback loops in Figure 1; see also Fiol &amp; Kovoor-Misra, 1997). As Hatch and Schultz note, "Who we are is reflected in what we are doing and how others interpret who we are and what we are doing" (1997: 54). There are some summary observations to make about this description of the process. First, organizational identity is not solely an inter- nally determined concept. Identity involves in- teractions and interrelationships between insid- ers and outsiders and, perhaps especially, insider perceptions of outsider impressions. Construed external image, thus, is key to the process of initiating changes in identity; it rep- resents organization members' interpretation of the feedback received from outsiders regarding the organization's fulfillment of expectations. It also represents the medium through which members determine how outsiders perceive the organization, thus affording a benchmark against which they can compare their own sense of the organization. In this way construed external image acts as the primary concept link- ing organizational self-definition through self- reflection with self-definition through other- ref lection. Second, the bases for asserting the interrela- tionships between identity and image are well established in the literature. In principle, those bases reach back at the individual level to Cooley (1902) and James (1918), and extend for-</page><page sequence="9">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 71 ward at the organizational level to Albert and Whetten (1985), Dutton and Dukerich (1991), Dut- ton et al. (1994), Reger et al. (1994), Elsbach and Kramer (1996), Gioia and Thomas (1996), and the insightful synopses contained in Whetten and Godfrey (1998), among others. Assembling these essential processes into a coherent framework demonstrates that the relationships between identity and image create the potential, and of- ten the likelihood, for a mutable identity. In addition to these processes, wherein com- municated image encourages (usually) incre- mental shifts in identity, there are other pro- cesses that tend to exacerbate and even accelerate changes in identity. In the following sections we highlight two perspectives-revi- sionist history and postmodernism-which pro- vide alternative views augmenting the argu- ment that identity is dynamic. Each suggests provocative conclusions about the effects of im- age on the stability of identity. Revisionist his- tory offers a compelling demonstration that members typically reinterpret the past in light of current insider beliefs and outsider perceptions, which has the effect of making identity appear stable to perceivers, even as it changes. The postmodern perspective offers an unsettling ar- gument for the relentless power of market and media images, which implies an extraordinary influence of images on identity over relatively short periods of time. Consideration of these arguments leads to further reflection about the nature of organizational identity and the impli- cations for organizational change. Revisionist History, Identity, and Image Just as organizational history is important to any change process, the revision of that history is equally important. Plausible change propos- als by top management must be seen as some- how related to "who we have been," yet propos- als for major change usually imply some inconsistency with previous identity. Whenever the question comes up about "who we are" or, especially, "who we want to be," not only do organization members revise their current per- ceptions of their organization (Ashforth &amp; Mael, 1996), they also engage in a process of revising their current perceptions of the past (cf. Loftus, 1980). The "facts" of the past might not be in doubt, but their meaning always is. All organizational history, in an important sense, thus becomes revisionist history. Both identity and image sustain only indirect inher- itances from the past; other aspects of that in- heritance are supplied by current orientations and (re)constructions of the meaning of past events. What organization members in earlier times took as "roots" are subjected to revised interpretations, as current needs or desired fu- ture image fuels the reinvention of the past. This process tends to foster the construction of a par- tially mythological history that modifies previ- ous identity to conform to some image of a cur- rent or a desired future state. As old Hungarian folk wisdom puts it, "The future is not in doubt; it is the past we worry about." Seen in this light, revisionist history has unavoidable implica- tions; it virtually assures some infidelity to pre- vious conceptions of identity. When organizations design and launch a planned change effort, they frequently employ a visionary projected future image as an impetus and a guide for achieving some desired revision in their structure, process, performance, and prestige (Gioia &amp; Thomas, 1996). Such images, which include symbolic representations of imagined future states that compromise present and past views, demand the reexamination of current identity. If the existing identity cannot be altered in some way, the change effort is unlikely to be successful. Biggart's (1977) study of the U.S. Postal Ser- vice's reorganization effort is illustrative of the efficacy of revising the interpretation of the past. She found that executives charged with manag- ing the change process pointedly discredited previously valued attributes of the organization (including former management styles, systems, structures, and even logos that were considered central to the organization's self-definition) in favor of newly espoused attributes. Thus, they reevaluated organizational history and identity as out of touch with the times, and they reinter- preted it as a way of justifying and motivating the need for change (Chreim, 1998). A related tactic for changing members' ways of understanding their organization is to inject intentional ambiguity into a complacent organi- zation to produce the necessary interpretive in- stability that creates opportunities for changing aspects of identity. When top managers induce "ambiguity-by-design" (Gioia &amp; Chittipeddi, 1991), they tend to destabilize existing interpre-</page><page sequence="10">72 Academy of Management Review January tations and create a desire for resolution of the ambiguity (i.e., a desire for a revised way of understanding that can alter the existing inter- pretations now deemed to be unworkable and yet still connect with the organization's history; cf. Pondy &amp; Huff, 1985). Top management can then fill the interpretational vacuum by offering a preferred view that lends structure to the equivocal setting (e.g., see Gioia &amp; Chittiped- di's, 1991, example of a university's ambiguous "top 10" future image, or Barney's, 1998, example of Koch Industries' labeling itself as a "discov- ery" company, both of which fostered change and adaptation). Such revised images require a reconsideration of "who we have been" if mem- bers are to maintain their desire for continuity in identity, so revisions to the current interpreta- tion of past identity occur. Ambiguity-by-design thus fosters consistency with, but departure from, the historical identity in need of current revision. The upshot of the revisionist history perspec- tive is the presentation of a view of identity as even more malleable than our process model suggests, simply because historical identity is susceptible to reinterpretation as organizations try to align their identities with current images. The attempts to maintain continuity with past understandings make identity appear stable to perceivers, even as it changes. The revisionist history view suggests that image strongly influ- ences identity; the postmodern view, however, pushes that argument to the limit. The Postmodern Lens on Identity and Image The implications of the blurred distinctions between identity and image are taken even fur- ther in a postmodern perspective. One finds the suggestion that image not only influences, but comes to dominate, organizational sensemaking in its most radical version in postmodern por- traits of contemporary organizational life (Bau- drillard, 1988, 1990; Hassard &amp; Parker, 1993). In spite of the sophisticated vocabulary, the con- clusion is simple: regardless of the starting point, everything ends up as image. More dra- matically, everything ends up as illusion. According to postmodernists, the usual por- trayal of identity within a modernist tradition is one emphasizing the influence of origin (found- ing) and asserting that the sense of identity is held at a deep level in the cultural surround of an organization (Schultz, 1992). In this tradi- tional view there is a relatively fixed notion of the historical development of identity that as- sumes the persistence of an essential identity, despite changing events, times, and percep- tions. Modernists, thus, see identity as the center anchor that endures and preserves its distinc- tiveness, despite the need for organizations to change. This identity is carefully projected onto the external environment, where it blends with "cultural capital" (Bourdieau, 1984) in the social construction of an image. Shifting images might, of course, influence the way organization- al members perceive their identity but rarely are assumed to challenge the permanent core of the organizational identity. This portrayal is markedly different from the dynamic, ephemeral, artificial, and even super- ficial portrait of organizational life in the post- modern literature, which stresses the process and predominance of image over claims of sub- stantive bases for identity. In short, the relation- ship between identity and image is turned up- side-down when seen through a postmodern lens; instead of emerging from organizational depth and origin, identity becomes a chame- leon-like imitation of images prevailing in the postmodern marketplace. Organizational iden- tity, thus, moves from a stable and distinct ori- gin toward a copy of images of dominating or- ganizations. In their analyses, Baudrillard (1988) and Per- niola (1982) have pursued this line of thought; they argue that identity is transformed into "im- age without identity" (Perniola, 1982: 59), be- cause identity is replaced by simulations of ex- ternal images (which Baudrillard terms simulacra). Identity no longer holds a distinct and persistent core of its own but becomes a reflection of the images of the present moment. These authors see these images largely as con- structed and transmitted by mass media and professional communicators within a given con- text. Thus, images themselves do not originate from some basic organizational reality but, rather, have been transformed through the pur- suit of success in an increasingly volatile and hypercompetitive marketplace. Baudrillard (1988) particularly emphasizes this perspective, tracing the progression of image from (1) its be- ginnings as a reflection of some basic reality, to (2) a means of masking and perverting a basic</page><page sequence="11">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 73 reality, to (3) masking an absence of reality, to (4) no longer bearing a relation to reality. As radi- cal as such a depiction is, it points to the shifting nature of image and its distancing from original character. In this sense, image not only sup- plants identity; image and identity both end up as illusions. Those holding a postmodern perspective, even in its less radical forms, see identity as most likely an illusion (Rosenau, 1992), albeit a necessary illusion- one required to reassure or- ganization members. We work diligently, if per- haps unconsciously, at constructing identity similarly from day to day to maintain the belief that we are the same person or organization that we were yesterday. Only over the long run, by retrospectively bracketing experience (Weick, 1979), do we become aware that progressive changes have occurred. Thus, postmodernists hold that given identi- ty's susceptibility to the vagaries of image, the presumption that organizational identity "ex- ists" and is deeply held by its members is better construed as an illusion. In this view the alleged abiding character of identity is instead cast as a comforting falsification intended to maintain a sense of consensuality where none might actu- ally exist, because of the inherent fluidity asso- ciated with the production of an immediate, visible, changeable image. Given the superfici- ality, malleability, and influenceability of im- age in the postmodern view (Baudrillard, 1988; Schultz, 1992), the assertion that either image or identity is "enduring" is simply dismissed. Is It Really All Just Image? If one considers the arguments about the in- terrelationships between identity and image, particularly from revisionist history and post- modern perspectives, one is confronted with in- creasing doubt or even skepticism about the vi- ability of the notion of a stable organizational identity. At best, a bona fide identity appears to "exist" only in the first stages of an organiza- tion's history, but it soon becomes subject to the significant influence of image, perhaps ulti- mately to be transformed into an illusory image (if one accepts a radical postmodern position). This is a rather provocative portrayal of identity for scholars and practitioners. Is it accurate? Or is there some intellectual sleight-of-hand oper- ating here? On the one hand, revisionist history and the processes articulated by postmodernists constitute conceptually viable views, so it is im- portant to acknowledge that shifts in identity and image can occur. On the other hand, there are some limiting reasons why these shifts are not necessarily carried to their extreme conclu- sions. First of all, the organizational environment itself serves to constrain extreme changes in identity. The same environment that fosters shifts in identity in the first place (by reflecting altered images of an organization's preferred projections of identity) simultaneously operates to limit the degree of those shifts. Agents and institutions in the environment work to maintain some semblance of recognition and stability in the environment in which they deal. They would like to believe that organizations with which they interact are similar to what they were yes- terday, so they seek to affirm stability in their own perceptions and, consequently, communi- cate a desire for nonradical shifts in identity and image. Organizations cannot construct just any arbitrarily chosen identity. Changes in identity are constrained within nonspecified, but nonetheless moderating, environmental bounds. One of the main assumptions in the population ecology perspective, for instance, is that organizations face strong internal and ex- ternal inertial forces that hinder their attempts at adapting to environmental changes (Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1977, 1984). Research has shown that there are certain conditions under which organ- izational inertia plays an even stronger role (e.g., in times of organizational decline; Cam- eron, Whetten &amp; Kim, 1987; Whetten, 1981), thus making a complete shift of identity into image unlikely for many organizations. Second, some research on threats to organiza- tional identity implies that elements of identity remain separate from image for organization members, even during times of focused image management (i.e., when organizations are trying to achieve some desired image, such as mem- bership in an elite group). Elsbach and Kramer (1996) found that university faculty members felt that some key aspects of their identity were threatened even when an esteem-enhancing im- age of the organization was portrayed (i.e., a high ranking in the Business Week survey). Such a ranking "implied that other central and valued dimensions of their organization were unimpor- tant or undervalued" (1996: 468). Receiving the</page><page sequence="12">74 Academy of Management Review January ranking based on the success of the MBA pro- gram, for instance, threatened aspects of iden- tity associated with the Ph.D. program. Thus, even in situations where an organizational im- age positively changes from that originally as- sociated with the organization, identity can re- main a distinct and important concept. Finally, the fact that organizations have mul- tiple identities in multiple contexts with multi- ple audiences not only undermines the idea of a holistic identity but also implies that neither identity nor image changes in a uniform or uni- fied fashion. Identities consist of constellations of features and labels appropriate for different contexts and interactions. Yet, some of the la- bels are shared in common across different identities, which implies that meanings for the common labels are flexible enough to accommo- date the differing demands of multiple possible contexts and audiences (e.g., customers, em- ployees, and competitors). Still, the degree of change in meaning is likely to be inhibited, be- cause companion identities are unlikely to be shifting together. Therefore, the multiple identi- ties common in large, complex organizations ac- tually can work to insulate the organization from wholesale alterations in the common core features of identity. Nonetheless, this self-same multiplicity also implies incremental shifts in the many facets of identity, thus maintaining identity in a state of flux and again suggesting that a stable, common identity cannot endure in any strict sense. Taken together, the upshot of the arguments for the progressive transformation of identity into image (and perhaps into illusion), as well as arguments noting limits on such transforma- tions, is that organizational identity is inevita- bly influenced by image but does not necessar- ily become image in some insidious fashion. Nonetheless, the overarching implication is that both identity and image are dynamic. The result of this dynamism and consequent instability is not as disheartening as it might sound, how- ever. We argue instead that it is this very insta- bility in identity that facilitates organizational adaptation to changes in internal and external environments. ADAPTIVE INSTABILITY The basic concept of adaptive instability in organizational identity is a straightforward one: as a consequence of its interrelationships with image in its various guises, organizational iden- tity becomes dynamic and mutable. This insta- bility in identity actually confers benefit to the organization, because it allows better adapta- tion to the demands of an environment that is itself undergoing continuous change. This no- tion builds upon the process description offered earlier, wherein organizational identity forms the basis for the development and projection of images, which are then received by outsiders, given their own interpretations, fed back to the organization in modified form, and subse- quently affect insiders' perception of their own identity. This reciprocal process of projection and mod- ification accounts for the observations noted by both revisionist historians and postmodernists, but it is distinct in one critical way: the strong role of image does not result in the wholesale dissolution of identity over time and replace- ment with image or (in the extreme) illusion but, rather, in a kind of dynamism that fosters ad- justment. With the notion of adaptive instability, we see the interrelationship between identity and image as mutually influencing and ulti- mately useful in aligning an organization's sense of self-definition with its environment. Without this recursive process, an organization would find itself trapped with an inevitably stagnant identity, unprepared to address de- mands that might have survival implications. Identity change can occur either reactively or proactively. The interpretation of an organiza- tion's projected image(s) by outsiders most often results in a reactive examination of identity. An obvious, but nonetheless striking, example ex- ists in the relationship organizations currently have with the media. Over time, an organization is subjected to multiple interpretations of its identity and image, most often transmitted through the media. This relationship results in a process of identity and image change, similar to the punctuated equilibrium processes described by Gersick (1991) and exemplified by Dutton and Dukerich's (1991) study of the New York/New Jer- sey Port Authority's attempts to reconcile its changing image with its strongly held identity. Another example concerns IBM; IBM had both an identity and a reputation as a single-minded mainframe company, which hindered its ability to capitalize on the burgeoning PC market in the 1980s. Over a relatively short period of time, IBM</page><page sequence="13">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 75 responded to its negative public impression- that of a ponderous giant unable to take advan- tage of a lucrative market exploited by smaller, more adroit companies. It shifted its identity into that of a multifaceted technology organization, ready to compete with smaller PC companies through advances in PC technology and expan- sion into such businesses as network computing and management consulting. IBM took a sub- stantially new way of approaching business, which, in turn, changed the way it thought of itself and how others perceived it. The interplay of identity and image worked dynamically to foster a necessary change in IBM's basic orien- tation toward itself and the market; image influ- enced identity, which, in turn, influenced image. Unexpected disruptions and their associated re- active changes constitute the most obvious ex- amples of identity-image interaction. Other research, however, has demonstrated that organizations can also be proactive in in- ducing identity change, even in the absence of obvious external pressure or crisis. As previ- ously noted, Gioia and Chittipeddi (1991) de- scribed a case wherein top managers intention- ally introduced ambiguity into a change situation to destabilize a strongly held (albeit outmoded) identity in preparation for a strategic change effort. In a later study of the same organ- ization, Gioia and Thomas (1996) found that the top managers sustained the ongoing change ef- fort by projecting and touting a captivating fu- ture image (becoming a "top-10 public research university") to help guide the organization to- ward a new, desired identity. They projected this desirable future image on the assumption that the image would channel identity into alignment. Such a proactive tack can facilitate change in an organization that is not (or is not likely to be) ready for the changes inevitably occurring in the environment, and it is based on the belief that an organization cannot change if it is com- placent about its self-definition-a self-defini- tion held to be maladaptive. To induce change, the organization must be destabilized and con- vinced that there is a necessity for a different way of seeing and being. This proactive stance acts to head off an eventual crisis by self- inducing a more moderate sense of urgency for change within the organization (a manifestation of Reger et al.'s, 1994, notion of tectonic change). These two positions on adaptive instability- reactive and proactive-represent two sides of the same coin. Identity and image are dynami- cally and recursively interrelated; the organiza- tion's self-definition is inherently unstable, yet this instability is adaptive for the organization. The difference is one of agency; reactive change stems from the actions of outsiders, and proac- tive change is self-induced. Regardless of the nature of the change, these arguments suggest a reconceptualization of identity that has both theoretical and practical implications. Implications of a Mutable Identity for Theory and Research In most writings on organizational identity, scholars use Albert and Whetten's (1985) defini- tion, typically invoking the main dimensions of identity as that which is core, distinctive, and enduring. This definition has served us well as a good first approximation and point of departure for explorations into organizational identity. Yet, even as this definition has furthered inves- tigations, it also has tended to impose limits on our ability to explore the concept's richness and dynamism. The foregoing discussion strongly suggests that because of the close relationships between identity and image, the characteriza- tion of identity as an enduring or stable notion becomes problematic, especially under condi- tions of change. Recognizing the socially con- structed nature of organizational identity, and accounting for the implications of revisionist history processes and postmodernist consider- ations, imply the need for some alteration in the conceptualization of identity. The theoretical im- plication of acknowledging a socially con- structed (and reconstructed) organizational identity is that even though we might use the same labels to describe the elements of a core identity, those elements are nonetheless subject to multiple and variable interpretations, which implies that identity changes with changing in- terpretations. Because we use the same labels over time to describe core elements of identity, it is deceptively easy to presume that identity is stable or enduring. The durability is in the la- bels, however-not in the interpretation of the meanings that make up the ostensible core. We seem to have operated on an assumption that if some aspect of identity is core, it is, by definition, stable, and conversely, that if some</page><page sequence="14">76 Academy of Management Review January aspect is changing, it is almost, by definition, peripheral. We need to be careful of this pre- sumption; because of the processes described earlier, even the core can shift, not only because of altered beliefs and values but also because of changing interpretations of persistent labels. Although we maintain a belief in "core" ele- ments of identity, that belief does not imply that the core is some tangible entity. Because iden- tity is not a "thing" but, rather, a concept con- structed and reconstructed by organization members, it is theoretically important to avoid its reification. All these considerations tend to render the traditional definition of organizational identity as too static to capture the pace of change of modern organizations. The guiding notion of a stable identity encourages researchers to con- tinue to frame organizational identity as endur- ing, even as it becomes more apparent that identity changes over relatively short periods. Ironically, researchers continue to invoke the durability criterion, even as they acknowledge and produce evidence that identity is malle- able-for example, Ashforth and Mael (1996), Dutton and Dukerich (1991), and Dutton et al. (1994). We would encourage researchers to be more open to the idea of a changeable identity. For cross-sectional studies, it is possible to act as if identity is stable. Such an assumption makes for parsimony, simplicity, clarity, and convenience in research reporting-and it has served us well. For longitudinal studies and more complex portrayals, however, we need to have the theoretical wherewithal to account for the dynamism of identity. Another way to make this important point is to note that theoretical conceptions need to keep up with the changing character and form of modern organizations. Unless we revise and ex- pand our theoretical assumptions, how might we account for "virtual organizations" (i.e., those temporary networks of people or organizations that come together quickly to accomplish a task and then dissolve, such as the temporary organ- izations assembled to make movies)? Such organ- izations are ephemeral by design, but they have a distinct identity. Similarly, how might we ac- count for "hollow corporations" that outsource many of their operations, or organizations oper- ating in volatile, hypercompetitive environ- ments that seem to incorporate changeability into the definitions of themselves (e.g., Silicon Valley companies)? How do we examine the identity of an organization like the Florida Mar- lins baseball team, which won the 1997 World Series and then was decimated in the space of months by the trading of key players? All these examples point to new ways of organizing, in which impermanence is a hallmark, and even a source of pride. Because these kinds of organi- zations are burgeoning, it becomes imperative to develop theoretical concepts that might more appropriately represent them. The defining portrayal of identity is no longer represented by the assertion "This is who we are as an organization!" nor even by the question "Who are we as an organization?" Capturing the ambiguity and mutability of identity instead re- volves around such questions as "Is this who we really are as an organization?" or, more provoc- atively, "Is this who we are becoming as an organization?" or even "Is this who we want to be?" These latter questions more adequately capture the important features of organizational identity as a negotiated, interactive, reflexive concept that, at its essence, amounts to an or- ganizational work-in-progress. It should be clear that identity will be called into question with increasing frequency in the modern and postmodern environment of organi- zations. Consequently, we believe that it is nec- essary to encourage the study of identity as something other than an enduring, reified con- cept. We need to study how organization mem- bers adapt to frequent information that suggests reconsideration of their organization's identity. We also need to better understand the interrela- tionships among different projections of identity and the feedback received by organization members. In particular, we need to investigate the processes by which discrepancies between identity and different types of image are recon- ciled (Corley &amp; Gioia, 1999). In addition, we need to study how organization members work to maintain continuity in the interpretation of iden- tity in the face of the increasing influence of image in a media-dominated environment (Alvesson, 1990)-for example, Canon Camera's "Image is Everything" ad campaign. Although we are skeptical of a radical postmodern view that identity soon becomes transformed into im- age and, ultimately, into illusion, we nonethe- less believe that identity can shift relatively quickly because of its interrelationship with im- age. The mutability of identity demands not only</page><page sequence="15">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 77 revised theoretical concepts but also revised empirical approaches. Implications of a Mutable Identity for Managers and Consultants These theoretical considerations also have practical manifestations. They suggest that a strategic concern for organizations might be the management of instability in identity, rather than the more frequently touted idea of trying to maintain an identity perceived as fixed. Of course, the attempt to balance stability and in- stability in identity is both delicate and danger- ous. In its most risky form, it can lead to the unintended substitution of faddish image for key values and can unwittingly produce the postmodern picture of identity as illusion (if managers are overly attuned to popular but po- tentially fleeting images in the media). Yet, suc- cessful accomplishment of this balance creates a sense of adaptiveness, affording the organiza- tion increased capacity for change, while main- taining a continuing sense of connection to cen- tral values. Do we really believe that intentionally desta- bilizing identity for the sake of instigating change is a viable recommendation for top man- agers? Yes, as long as that attempt is guided by a compelling future image that remains sensi- tive to the maintenance of continuity in ele- ments of identity that provide the necessary security to accomplish change. Such a recom- mendation stems from the recognition that iden- tity change is not always triggered by events in high-velocity environments (Gioia &amp; Chitti- peddi, 1991; Gustafson &amp; Reger, 1995), by envi- ronmental jolts (Meyer, 1982), or by stigma (Fiol &amp; Kovoor-Misra, 1997; Sutton &amp; Callahan, 1987), but also by proactive preparation for envisioned change to maintain viability. We find two striking examples in the transfor- mations of a former computer peripherals man- ufacturing firm in Pittsburgh and of the Danish hearing-aid manufacturer, Oticon. In the case of the computer peripherals manufacturer, the vice president of operations described how, in mere months, they transformed the organization from a hardware manufacturer into an Internet pub- lishing firm by changing not only what they offered their customers but also their self- definition: "We had to think differently of our- selves in order to change from a product- oriented company to a service-oriented firm" (personal conversation with vice president of operations, The Internet Group, May 1997). At Oticon, the CEO-Lars Kolind-undertook the task of transforming the organization from a production-focused company to a service- focused company. Under the slogan "think the unthinkable," the company communicated a new identity through the use of "The Spaghetti Organization" metaphor and through the key symbols of a paper-free organization with flexi- ble working environments (Morsing &amp; Eiberg, 1998). The company shared this future image with the local media, who were then invited to talk with Oticon employees about their feelings toward the company's new image. Over the next several months, the projected Oticon image made international headlines. This intense ex- ternal interest served to shake loose the old identity held by the organization's members and to move the company toward achieving the CEO's vision for an altered identity (Morsing &amp; Eiberg, 1998). Both firms, then, accomplished their transfor- mations by projecting a new image of them- selves and then working toward that image to transform identity (see Abratt, 1989; Balmer, 1995; and Dowling, 1994, for discussions of re- lated issues in the corporate image literature). If we take seriously the tenet that organiza- tions must change, and if we take seriously the idea that bona fide change requires an alter- ation in some core beliefs about the character of the organization, then our conceptual represen- tations, as well as our practical recommenda- tions, must also specifically account for the mal- leability of identity. As is the case with many aspects of organizational change, consultants often play key roles in an organization's at- tempts to deal with identity change. Recasting identity as a more dynamic concept holds sev- eral implications for identity and image consult- ants, who deal primarily in the realm of "corpo- rate identity." Their main intent is to project an image that captures the "central idea" of a cor- poration, expressing the core values of the com- pany mainly through visual representations that also aid the corporation in achieving its strategic goals. Given their vanguard role in corporate iden- tity management, consultants are now begin- ning to recognize that the traditional, sequential process of identity management (identifying the</page><page sequence="16">78 Academy of Management Review January core beliefs, forming a visual image of the core, obtaining internal consensus for that image, launching the symbolic representation to the public, and, finally, "making it stick"; Olins, 1995: 63) becomes problematic when trying to account for the fluid and dynamic identity now characterizing many client organizations. No longer can they rely on the organization having a single, stable identity that can be identified, agreed upon, and easily projected. Instead, identity management now must involve the si- multaneous formation of identity and image by linking internal preferences with internal and external projections and perceptions in a dy- namic process. Here, the consultant's task is not only to figure out the corporate identity (or at least the identity that the corporation wants to project) but, concurrently, to assess what will be successful in the marketplace as a projected representation. Thus, consultants find themselves in the often awkward position of trying to tell top managers what they would like to hear while also express- ing what others would like the organization to be. Therefore, we argue that identity consultants now operate in a world that requires them to help define or even transform an identity in a way that simultaneously connotes stability and continuity with an adroit adaptiveness to the preferences and demands of multiple audiences and different situations. In other words, identity consultants find themselves at the crossroads of the paradox that organizations must execute the delicate balancing act of simultaneously chang- ing while staying the same. British Airways (BA) is an example of a com- pany that has transformed its corporate identity and image with the assistance of identity con- sultants. As of the early 1990s, BA had become a running joke in the airline industry ("BA - Bloody Awful"). Its consulting firm confronted top management with the uncomfortable con- clusion that BA harbored an identity that in- cluded a misplaced pride in the traditional Brit- ish disdain for customer service (and was therefore suffering in a competitive business travel world that emphasized service). BA then transformed its expression of corporate identity by adopting a dynamic logo and a new slogan ("the world's favorite airline"), aimed at both insiders and outsiders, while also touting those nonproblematic features of identity that employ- ees held dear. Along with other substantive and symbolic changes, both audiences came to ac- cept the projection; as of 1998, BA was the num- ber one rated international business travel air- line. ' The now more apparent relationships be- tween corporate identity and image also have implications for the kinds of services offered by identity and image consultants and desired by organizations. Traditionally, identity and image management have developed as two separate types of professional services. Identity services were provided specifically by corporate identity consultants, whereas image management has been the purview of advertising and public re- lations (Fombrun, 1996). Consultants now are crossing the boundaries between identity and image management, however, by creating new services that necessarily integrate the concerns for both identity and image. These new services focus on integrating internal and external com- munication practices, while creating new forms of interactive relations between customers and organizational members. Fundamental to these changes is the recognition by consultants that shifting and multiple interpretations of identity must be reflected in the creation of the identity program itself. Taking a fluid approach to iden- tity change implies that a "central" characteris- tic of identity might be its ability to shift and transform according to the context in which it is being expressed. CONCLUSION With our questioning of the alleged endur- ing character of organizational identity, we have attempted to advance its conceptualiza- tion in a way that better represents the essen- tial nature of perceptual life in organizations. The concept of identity is key to understanding modern organizations. In fact, acknowledging 1 It also is interesting to note that BA more recently intro- duced yet another alteration in its corporate identity that can be seen as an attempt to balance stability and change. This new program symbolizes the multicultural diversity of "the world's favorite airline" in its use of a series of distinct tailfin designs, each created by leading designers from dif- ferent countries and each clearly referring to a different national heritage. Stability is symbolized in a BA logo on the front of each airplane; change and multiple identities in the distinctive tailfins. The international attention devoted to the corporate identity campaign has clearly led to the in- creasing globalization of a formerly very British identity.</page><page sequence="17">2000 Gioia, Schultz, and Corley 79 the interrelationships among identity and im- age allows the recognition that it is the very fluidity of identity that helps organizations adapt to changes. Accordingly, a concern of theorists and researchers is no longer solely the study of a durable organizational identity but also a concern for the implications of a mutable identity. The necessity to change in order to adapt, but nonetheless to retain a sense that identity stays the same, has been argued by Gagliardi (1986). In his view, to preserve the character of identity, organizations, paradoxically, must change. We argue instead that the project of management is now different, because of the influential interrelationships between identity and image, and also because of the rise to prominence of image in the current era. The strategic concern of management is no longer the preservation of a fixed identity but the ability to manage and balance a flexible iden- tity in light of shifting external images. Main- tenance of consistency becomes the mainte- nance of dynamic consistency. Instability fosters adaptability. REFERENCES Abratt, R. 1989. A new approach to the corporate image management process.
