<plain_text><page sequence="1">STERN, DAVID. Midrash and Theory: Ancient Jewish Exegesis and Contemporary Literary Studies. Rethinking Theory series. Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1996. viii+ 118 pp. $49.95 (cloth). This slim, reticent presentation of four previously published and now-reworked essays serves to conceal a bold and multifaceted view of classical rabbinic midrash and its relationship to contemporary literary theory. A new introductory chapter evokes the courtship of midrash by modern literary critics, who saw in this ancient Jewish exegesis "the paradigm for exegesis as a creative religious and imaginative act" (p. 8). Historicism's shortcomings had somehow nudged the critics toward an ancient Jewish mode of reading, one that was characterized "by a virtually ideo- logical policy of polysemy" (p. 23). Stern asserts that this midrashic polysemy is, however, quite different from the poststructuralist concept of indeterminacy (p. 22). The following two chapters investigate two pivotal literary forms of midrashic discourse, the mashal (parable) and the literary homily. The concluding chapter explores the formidable, almost intractable problem of portraying rabbinic theol- ogy. The chapter on the mashal is an illuminating digest of Stern's major work on the subject, Parables in Midrash: Narrative and Exegesis in Rabbinic Literature (Cam- bridge, 1991). The next chapter deftly develops Joseph Heinemann's 1971 insight into the literary homily of Leviticus Rabbah. Stern focuses on the first homily of the collection, dilating on the recurrent word "haviv" (dear or beloved), which he sees as the signature of the entire work. That is to say, "the redactor ... shifted the entire burden of meaning for the reading away from its content ... and placed it instead upon the event of revelation and, in particular, the style of its language, the kind of speech I have attempted to characterize using the term havivut" (p. 69). In the final chapter, Stern tackles a number of midrashic texts that con- tain depictions of God's persona, and which are quite at odds with one another. Building on E. E. Urbach's foundational work on rabbinic thought, Stern views rabbinic anthropomorphism as "the tightrope between heaven and earth ... the literary corollary for the Rabbis' desire to uphold the side of immanence" (p. 87). In a surprising conclusion relying heavily on Paul Veyne's Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths: An Essay on the Constitutive Imagination (Chicago, 1988), Stern writes, "If the Rabbis had been asked if they believed in the 'truth' of midrash-of the interpretations the Rabbis offered, which explicitly or implicitly contain aggadot that raise the same kind of problem for us as do the Rabbis' various anthropomor- phic descriptions of God, they would probably have offered a similar answer that the midrashim were true but that their truth was hardly the same truth as the kind they might have encountered in their daily lives" (p. 93). I have summarized Stern's major statements, without sufficiently noting the breadth of his scholarship; Stern moves gracefully through the classical world, Jewish, Christian, and pagan, while remaining firmly anchored in modern liter- ary theory. These are provocative and penetrating essays, accompanied by rich 310</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews but succinct footnotes. The book begins with a cautious dispelling of the forced link of midrash and modern theory and ends by boldly advocating the interpreta- tion of the medium of midrashic discourse as disclosing its own theological stance. It was L. Zunz in his pioneering Die gottesdienslichen Vortrage derJuden historisch entwickelt (1832; 2d ed., Frankfurt, 1892), who viewed midrash as a surrogate for the prophetic voice, a voice that most of the Rabbis, though by no means all, believed had been stilled. It seems to me that Stern's account of anthropomor- phism might have benefitted from a careful scrutiny of the nature of God's word in rabbinic thought. This topic is taken up briefly in chapter one, where Stern treats the "near identification of Torah and God" that "provides the Rabbis with the basic axioms of midrashic hermeneutics: first, the belief in the omnisignifi- cance of Scripture ... second the claim of the essential unity of the Scripture as the expression of the single divine will" (p. 29). The polysemic nature of midrash would seem to point in the direction of a rabbinic consciousness of the inexhaust- ibility of Scripture. Humanity's most creative and extravagant attempts at teasing out the meaning of Scripture will always in some measure fall short of the surplus of meaning. This must say something also about the Rabbis's view of God, if this is their posture toward God's word. I have elsewhere tried to show that the Chris- tian attack on Jewish anthropomorphism in the rabbinic period is no different than the attempts in late antiquity of denying your rivals' right to allegorize their texts ("Reflections on the aggada of Caesarea" in Caesarea Maritima: A Retrospective after Two Millenia [Leiden, 1996], pp. 469-75). The anthropomorphic slur is part of the stock of interreligious polemic. The adversary always holds a primitive conception of God. I see no reason to retreat to the Veyne position and to posit some middle ground of belief and nonbelief held at the same time. There is of course much more to be said about this, a subject that demands renewed interest, and for this we are indebted to Stern's stimulating and challenging essays. In closing it should be noted that after Judah Goldin's tenure at the University of Pennsylvania, students of midrash had grown accustom to the erudite and urbane studies of midrash that were his trademark. David Stern firmly continues that proud tradition. MARC HIRSHMAN, Hebrew University ofJerusalem.</page></plain_text>
