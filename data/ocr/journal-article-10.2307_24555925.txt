He very much ii-sented biographical interpretations of his work. In fact, Jo Miller was inaccurate in at least one other instance: she wrote that since the 1940 drypoints "Albers has not curved a Ü§i| line."22 Such 1944 prints as Adapted B, which looks like three microorganisms wriggling across the woodgrain, or Involute, with its kidneylike disposition, prove otherwise.

'Velocidad,' etc." The error was not corrected before the book went to press. All this is not to say that Albers avoided par allel lines throughout the '30s and '40s. The lith ographs in his 1941-42 Graphic Tectonics series are, in contrast to the more delicate, curvilin ear prints, monumental in concept. To Monte Alban, for example, with its simple lines of dual width bent only at right angles, is characteris tic of the series as a whole. An initial impres sion of flatness gives way to illusions of dra matic projection and depth. The tiny signa ture seems dwarfed by the architectural force of the image, which, in its nested rectangles, presages the compositions of Albers' Homages to the Square. And his white-on-black Multiplex woodcuts of 1946-48, with their complex games of directional hide-and-seek, similarly look to the future, when the angle would definitively triumph over the curve.

See also Nicholas Fox Weber, "The Artist as Alchemist," in Josef Albers: A Retrospective, Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1988, p. 31. AVeber says that prints made in 1934 in North Car olina were produced in Asheville, though he does not mention the Biltmore Press; ibid., p. 32. Albers' notebook is at the Albers Foundation in Orange, Con necticut. When shown reproductions of the prints Albers said were made at Biltmore, Bob Williams, the current director of the press, said that they looked more like studio prints from a handpress than prints made at Biltmore. Williams is the son of the man in charge of Biltmore when Albers was at Black Moun tain, and himself never met Albers; he also searched old ledgers at Biltmore, but was unable to turn up additional information on Albers' work at Biltmore. Phone conversation, May 2, 1995. 4For example, letter from Anni Albers, 1934; Albers Foundation. 5For a printed reference to Reinhard Schumann, see Jo Miller, Josef Albers: Prints, 1915-1970, Brooklyn Museum, 1973, p. 13, who states that the prints were done in Hickory, North Carolina, where Schumann lived. The Brooklyn Museum catalogue was one in a series on prints published by the museum; it resem bles an exhibition catalogue, with a checklist, but there was evidently never an exhibition. Prior to the forthcoming catalogue raisonné, it is the most complete survey of Albers' prints, with 22 from the '30s and '40s illustrated. The eight Graphic Tectonics are Ascension, Interim, Introitus, Prefatio, Sanctuary, Seclusion, Shrine, and To Monte Alban. A ninth print, Co-Ordinal, was for some reason not editioned with the others despite its obvious connection to the rest of the series. There are only two known surviving examples of Co-Ordinal, which was first reproduced in the Brooklyn Museum catalogue. Graphic Tecton ics is, therefore, sometimes referred to as a series of nine, including Co-Ordinal, see, for example, Weber, The Drawings of Josef Albers, New Haven, 1984, p. 40. 6In her essay, Jo Miller reports that in 1944 Albers often used "a bookbinder's bone to incise his lines to get a softer white edge," p. 9. In the proofing gal leys for Miller's essay, Albers inserted his own, hand written notation: "instead of cutting them." The notated galleys are at the Albers Foundation. Bilt more is the press cited in the Brooklyn Museum catalogue, p. 14, and this fact was not, like others in the catalogue, disputed by Albers. According to Eunice Hord Allen, however, who worked at Biltmore Press from 1938 to 1973, the only jobs done by Bilt more for Black Mountain College were large print ingjobs like catalogues and brochures. She does not remember Albers editioning at Biltmore. Phone conversation, April 25, 1995.
