<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Nabokov’s Experiments and  the Nature of Fictionality Brian Richardson The case of a character in a novel bearing the name or  likeness of its nonfi ctional creator dramatizes the fault  line that separates fi ction from nonfi ction, a distinc- tion more durable than many care to acknowledge yet  not as unbridgeable as others would aver. We can get a  sense of what is at stake in this distinction by glancing  at the way Nabokov begins his afterword, “On a Book  Entitled Lolita”: “After doing my impersonation of the  suave John Ray, the character in Lolita who pens the  Foreword, any comments coming straight from me  may strike one—may strike me, in fact—as an imper- sonation of Vladimir Nabokov talking about his own  book” (1970: 313). One of the great intellectual achieve- ments of modern narrative theory was to establish a  fundamental differentiation between the narrator and  the author and to ensure that the positions advocated  by the one are not simplistically and erroneously pred- </page> <page sequence="2"> icated of the other. And this distinction is most important for the un- derstanding of Lolita. But the separability of author and narrator does  not mean that the two cannot be brought closely together (even in Lo- lita, as we will see). The differentiation between the author and a fi ctive being who close- ly resembles the author was central to the theory and practice of classic  modernist fi ction, and it is worthwhile to review it here. In the major  novels of Joyce, Proust, and others, some of the characters are undis- guised versions of their authors’ earlier selves who think thoughts and  undergo events similar to those experienced by their makers. For the  most part such correspondences are ultimately adventitious: our read- ing of Ulysses is unchanged if we learn that the young Joyce actually had  a conversation on Shakespeare’s Hamlet with John Eglington and oth- ers in the National Library in Dublin, rather like Stephen Dedalus does.  Or, more deviously, readers’ interpretations of Ulysses are not likely to  change even if they learn that it was not the young Joyce but rather Oli- ver St John Gogarty, the model for Buck Mulligan, who paid the rent for  the Martello tower Joyce stayed in, whereas in the novel it is clear that  Stephen pays the rent and Buck thereby becomes the “usurper.” In these  cases, the life of the author is simply convenient raw material that will  later be reproduced or radically reworked in the storyworld depending  on the requirements of the composition of the text. If Dedalus needs to  be dispossessed of his lodging, he will be, whether or not Joyce actually  was. The relation then between life and art is one of largely indifferent  correspondences. Insofar as the author’s life forms an appropriate nar- rative trajectory, its salient details will remain; insofar as those details  fail to cohere, new ones will quickly be invented. In this context it is illuminating to recall the refl ections of author  Christopher Isherwood on the character-narrator whom he created  and who bears the same name: “In writing Goodbye to Berlin, I de- stroyed a certain portion of my real past. I did this deliberately, because  I preferred the simplifi ed, more creditable, more exciting fi ctitious past  which I’d created to take its place. Indeed, it had now become hard for  me to remember just how things really had happened. I only knew how  I would have liked them to have happened—that is to say, how I had  made them happen in my stories. And so, gradually, the real past had  74 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="3"> disappeared, along with the real Christopher Isherwood of twenty years  ago. Only the Christopher Isherwood of the stories remained” (1954:  vii–viii). Similarly Nabokov’s earlier novels require a substantial separation  of the fi ctionalized and the autobiographical self, even when, as in The  Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941/1959), the narrator’s own life merges  with the novels written by his half-brother, novels that he is trying to  comprehend and save from critics who insist on—what else?—a narrow  biographical reductionism. The narrator of this work, identifi ed in the  text only as “V.,” does have numerous features in common with Nabo- kov himself; his elusive alter ego, Sebastian, has still more: both were  born December 31, 1899, in St. Petersburg, both moved to England af- ter the Russian Revolution, both attended Cambridge, and so on. Sebas- tian himself may be, as Michael Wood suggests, “a picture of the writer  Nabokov sometimes thought he might be. Better still, a picture of the  writer many critics thought and still think Nabokov is” (1994: 33). Nev- ertheless, the correspondences between Nabokov and his creations re- main largely ironic; one may not infer anything about Nabokov from  the behavior or opinions expressed by the characters. While no direct inference from his life to his fi ction is authorized by  the text, this does not mean that the facts of his life are entirely irrel- evant to a comprehensive reading of the work. The two would oscillate  in a kind of arabesque throughout his career; as Michael Begnal points  out, “Just as V. plundered Knight’s novels for his own, Nabokov looted  Sebastian Knight for [his own autobiography,] Speak, Memory” (1996:  3). Like Joyce and Proust, Nabokov made a work of fi ction out of mate- rials culled from his own experience, and he invented events and scenes  derived from his own and others’ literary texts. But Nabokov braids life  and fi ction together more deviously than these other modernist au- thors, since some of the divergences between fi ction and fact can be  read as unactualized possibilities in Nabokov’s own existence. The novel  not only traces out some patterns of his life but also points toward the  life he did not live. And there is yet another twist: in Sebastian Knight  (1941/1959), V. goes on to experience many of the events about which  Sebastian has written in his novels; Nabokov thereby denies the facile  reduction of the achievement of art to the personality of the author and  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 75 </page> <page sequence="4"> instead produces a far deeper allegory of the way a text creates its audi- ence. The book does not expose the author; rather, it fashions its read- er. As such, it embodies Nabokov’s confl icted view toward this whole  subject; as Andrew Field has observed, “Nabokov was both repelled and  fascinated by biography, which he called psychoplagiarism” (1986: 3).1  Yet as Nabokov’s writing evolved, so too did his play with the bound- ary between fi ction and autobiography, play that culminated in his last  completed novel, Look at the Harlequins! (1974). In what follows I identify fi ve rather ingenious confl ations or colli- sions of author and character in the work of Nabokov. But fi rst I provide  a brief account of current attempts to theorize the fi ction/nonfi ction  distinction. Overall, my argument is that Nabokov’s work can help us  clarify the general salience of this distinction as well as indicate signifi - cant gray areas where the distinction fails to hold. My analysis further  reveals the validity of one of the current theories of fi ctionality and the  limitations of its main rival; it also sheds light on theoretical perspec- tives that attempt to clarify the relation between authors and narrators. The Nature of Fictionality David Gorman identifi es a signifi cant debate between two types of theo- ries of fi ctionality. On the one hand, pragmatic theories set forth by John  Searle and others assert that “no purely linguistic or textual property of a  narrative can serve as a criterion of its fi ctionality” (Gorman 2005: 166).  What is essential is the kind of speech act the work is attempting to per- form: if it presents itself as a work of fi ction, it thereby adheres to a set of  conventions “which suspend the normal operation of the rules relating  illocutionary acts and the world” (Searle 1979: 67). When Joyce states in  a novel that Leopold Bloom lived at 7 Eccles Street in Dublin on June 16,  1904, he is performing a different kind of illocutionary act (“make-be- lieve”) than if he had made the identical statement in a work of nonfi c- tion. On the other hand, approaches based on semantics affi rm instead  that there are distinctive aspects of language and content that demar- cate a work’s fi ctional status, such as the presence of free indirect speech  or an omniscient narrator. Thus, if we fi nd a sentence like, “He thought  about the lives he might have led, though no one would ever know this,”  76 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="5"> we know the work within which it appears is fi ction, because such state- ments are epistemologically impossible in nonfi ction: in the world of  our experience, no one can know the uncommunicated thoughts of an- other. Beyond these two positions, there is also the widespread view that  has been designated “panfi ctionalism” by Marie-Laure Ryan in a 1997  article. The panfi ctionalist view denies that fi ctional and nonfi ctional  discourse can be disentangled; all statements are ultimately fi ctional,  it insists. In the recent formulation by Richard Walsh, “the categorical  difference between real and imagined events is overwhelmed by the ar- tifi ciality of narrative representation in either case: all narrativity . . .  shares in the properties of fi ctionality” (2007: 39). The work of Nabokov is well positioned to help elucidate the claims  of these rival accounts, and in what follows I outline fi ve ways in which  Nabokov problematizes the doctrine of the absolute separation of au- thor and narrator in a work of fi ction. I discuss these methods under  the following rubrics: urfi ction, or texts that are presented such that they  can be read either as fi ction or as nonfi ction; author/narrator confl ation,  in which the author of the nonfi ctional paratext merges with the narra- tor of the fi ction; autobiography as intertext, where key facts in the life  and work of the author are essential to the interpretation of the fi ction;  transparent voices, where the author’s opinions are expressed through  the speech of a character; and authorial interpolation, signs within the  text that reveal the presence of the author. The fi rst two types contrib- ute to debates concerning the signposts and nature of fi ctionality; all  fi ve types are pertinent to discussions of the fi ction/nonfi ction distinc- tion. Ultimately, I argue for the pragmatic account of the nature of fi c- tionality and affi rm the importance of the fi ction/nonfi ction distinction  even as I note the many ways in which Nabokov plays with, challenges,  or collapses it. Nabokov’s Intrusions into His Fictional Worlds urfiction: texts as fiction or nonfiction A fascinating fusion of life and art is present in two of Nabokov’s short- er texts that have been published both as fi ction and as autobiography.  The stories, “Mademoiselle O” (1939) and “First Love” (which was fi rst  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 77 </page> <page sequence="6"> printed under the title “Colette”) both appear in his 1958 short story col- lection, Nabokov’s Dozen, and in The Stories of Vladimir Nabakov. Both  stories also appear, with slight alterations, as chapters of his autobiog- raphy, Speak Memory (1966).2 Two questions are immediately raised by  such a practice: what are the implications of composing a work that can  be read either as one or the other mode, and what are the consequences  of publishing it as both? In “The Autobiographical Contract” Philippe Lejeune clarifi es the  key differences between autobiography and fi rst-person fi ction. For  Lejeune, the crucial difference is that in an autobiography, “there must  be an identity between the author, the narrator, and the protagonist”  (1982: 193), whereas in fi ction written in the fi rst person the narrator  is not the same as the author. But the examples from Nabokov seem to  elude this dichotomy: they are, at the same time, both fi ction and non- fi ction, challenging the opposition on which Lejeune insists. A closer look at these curious texts is called for, and we may begin  by noting some admittedly minor differences between the fi ctional and  the autobiographical versions of the text of “First Love.” The story text  is slightly shorter, contains substitutions for a few words, and replaces  proper names with occupations; thus, the autobiography refers to “Lin- derovski” (Nabakov 1966: 151), whereas in his fi ctional incarnation he  becomes simply “my tutor.” That is, specifi c names unnecessary to the  unfolding of the tale are replaced in the story. Additional personal and  historical details, appropriate for a memoir but dispensable in a fi ction,  are likewise duly removed (Nabakov 1995: 142–43). It should be noted  that none of the changes has any effect on the status of the text as fi c- tion or nonfi ction; the changes merely make the fi ctional version more  economical and provide the autobiographical version with a bit more  factual matter. Especially interesting are more essential divergences that underscore  the differences between the two modes. Nabokov writes that his sisters  angrily protested that he had incorrectly left them out of the railway  trip to Biarritz in the original version of the autobiography (14); in the  revised text he obligingly indicates they were there, riding in the next  car (142), but in the fi ctional incarnation he eliminates them altogether  as unnecessary to the work’s plot. These emendations underscore that  78 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="7"> nonfi ction is falsifi able while fi ction is not; no human can protest she  was actually present at a scene in a fi ction. Likewise, we learn in the au- tobiography that “Colette” is a pseudonym and see that this name ap- pears in the book’s index; no such qualifi cation is needed in the story:  there the girl is simply Colette, and there is no index to worry about  (not until Pale Fire appeared in 1962 would Nabokov construct an index  for a work of fi ction). Finally, there is a gesture in the text whose effect changes somewhat  as one moves from mode to mode. Near the end of the piece, the narra- tor notes that he cannot remember the name of Colette’s dog, and that  this bothers him. Several paragraphs later, “A delightful thing happens”  (Nabakov 1995: 150): recalling other aspects and souvenirs of his days  on the Riviera, “along those remote beaches, over the glossy evening  sands of the past, where each footprint slowly fi lls up with sunset water”  (151–52), the dog’s name re-enters his consciousness, and the conjuring  up of fading memories is completed. However, at the risk of sounding  like Borges dismissing the failings of the unfortunate Pierre Menard, I  feel that the text works better—by Nabokov’s own standards of literary  form—as autobiography than as fi ction. In this case, I personally fi nd  the dramatization of the recovery of a lost memory much more com- pelling in the autobiographical narrative, especially one that has mem- ory and its vagaries as a central theme, and during which the exiled au- thor laments the absence of documents to aid his recall. In the story the  suddenly recovered name seems, by contrast, relatively contrived; it has  fewer of the intimations of immediacy that the autobiographical con- text produces and thus provides considerably less of l’effet du réel. We may conclude that “First Love,” like “Mademoiselle O,” is a rare  hybrid that can be read either as fi ction or as nonfi ction; that is, it obeys  the rules for both modes and can reward either kind of reading. De- pending on our perspective, the world depicted is either the actual world  or a fi ctional storyworld. The fi gure who says “I” either is Nabokov or  is merely a fi ctitious narrator, depending on the way we contextualize  the work. Read as fi ction, it cannot be falsifi ed; read as nonfi ction, it is  making verifi able statements about the real world that are subject to cor- roboration.3 Drawing on the famous illustration employed by Gestalt  psychologists, we may say that what we have here is the “duck/rabbit” of  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 79 </page> <page sequence="8"> narrative. If we must designate it by a name, we might employ a term as  unusual as the texts themselves: urfi ction. These examples show that the  semantic theory of fi ctionality is inadequate: the fi ctional and nonfi c- tional versions of the same events are virtually identical linguistically. By  contrast, a pragmatic approach that stresses the use to which a particular  text is put (that is, as fi ction or as autobiography) can explain the oscil- lating fi ctional status of these strange works.4 We may pause here to enumerate some other comparable examples  of this kind of writing practice. Urfi ctional texts that could appear ei- ther as (barely) fi ction or as (slightly fi ctionalized) nonfi ction are not  entirely unknown, beginning with Gérard de Nerval’s Aurélia (1855), a  generically indeterminate text that is treated both as fi ction and as au- tobiography. Some of Virginia Woolf ’s shorter texts, like “A Mark on the  Wall” (1917), may be read as fi ction or personal essay; their inclusion in  the volume of Woolf ’s Complete Shorter Fiction is justifi ed by the edi- tor because “the narrator’s voice is not necessarily identical with the au- thor’s” (Woolf 1989: 2), a much milder version of one of Lejeune’s prin- cipal criteria of fi ctionality. Woolf herself, it might be observed, was less  certain of the status of these works and wondered in one of her diary  entries from 1920 whether she didn’t “deal . . . in autobiography &amp; call it  fi ction” (Woolf 1920–24/1980: 7). Meanwhile, in the most autobiographical stories of Isaac Babel, there  is no way to differentiate the author from the narrator other than by an  appeal to the paratextual markers that designate them as fi ctions. Re- becca Stanton notes that these stories, though fi ctional, “pretend” oth- erwise, identifying themselves by means of various cues as autobiogra- phy. As Stanton puts it, “By installing a fi rst person narrator/protagonist  who shares his name as well as signifi cant details of his autobiography,  Babel establishes a relationship between himself (or ‘himself ’?) and  the reader that is governed by time honored conventions of credibility  and credence: the relationship for which Philippe Lejeune, a quarter of  a century ago, coined the term ‘autobiographical pact’” (Stanton 2001:  117).5 Henry Miller also belongs to this group of writers who challenge  the boundary between fi ction and autobiography. As Wayne Booth re- counts, when praised by Edmund Wilson for his skillful, ironic portrait  of a particular type of American poseur idling around Paris, Miller in- 80 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="9"> dignantly responded: “The theme is myself, and the narrator, or the  hero, as your critic puts it, is also myself. . . . If he means the narra- tor, then it is me” (qtd. in Booth 1961/1983: 367). As he continued writ- ing, Miller straddled this boundary ever more effectively, especially as  he sought out certain personalities and potentially dramatic situations  that would be likely to provide good dialogue and scenes to transcribe  later on. Placing these texts within a larger conceptual framework, we  may affi rm that fi ctional narratives are very different speech acts from  nonfi ction narratives: they are used differently, perform different func- tions, and require a different kind of reception. The concerned specta- tor who shouts out to the actor playing Othello, “Don’t believe Iago— he’s telling you a lie!” demonstrates the terms of the fi ction/nonfi ction  distinction as well as the consequences of misapplying them. At the  same time, some narratives exist that blur this distinction and remain  ontologically ambiguous or indeterminable. In fact, the existence of this  gray area is possible only because of the existence elsewhere of distinc- tions it collapses. Another sentence from Speak, Memory is also potentially relevant to  the debate between pragmatic and semantic theories of fi ctionality. The  author seems to be disclosing the thoughts of another when he states  that the last time he saw Colette she “slipped into my brother’s hand a  farewell present, a box of sugar-coated almonds, meant, I know, solely  for me” (1966: 152). Taken literally, this statement is the kind that is sup- posed by Käte Hamburger, Dorrit Cohn, and others to be a signpost of  fi ctionality. And there are many other such statements in this autobiog- raphy, which is structured more like a devious modernist novel rather  than a conventional memoir, as Christian Moraru has disclosed (2005:  40–54). Further refl ection on this text as well as more extreme examples  like Edmund Morris’s notorious biography of Ronald Reagan, Dutch,  which provides samples of Reagan’s thoughts throughout the volume,  reveal instead that the presence of devices from narrative fi ction does  not indicate that the text is fi ctional: Nabokov’s book remains an autobi- ography, and Morris’s a biography, albeit an eccentric one. Both remain  falsifi able on all other points, despite the presence of techniques that  normally can only be legitimately used in fi ction. We can easily bracket  such impossible thought transcriptions as the educated guesses of the  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 81 </page> <page sequence="10"> author. These texts are, rather, examples of a blending of fi ctional and  nonfi ctional elements, as Murray Smith (2009) has recently described  this practice. Yet the fact that they are blended does not imply that they  cannot be separated back out and identifi ed as nonfi ctional or fi ctional- ized. In short, we may conclude with Gérard Genette that such purport- ed indexes of fi ctionality are not “obligatory, constant, and suffi ciently  exclusive that nonfi ction could not possibly borrow them” (1990: 773). author/narrator conflation The author/narrator confl ation, which threatens to collapse the distinc- tion between the author of the book and the narrator of the text, is an- other interesting stratagem; it appears most prominently in Nabokov’s  Bend Sinister (1947). This work, like so many other novels, is divided  into a preface, written by the author, and a fi rst-person text, articulated  by the work’s narrator. These boundaries are customarily kept quite dis- tinct, as in the prefaces of Henry James or Joseph Conrad, though they  can be tampered with. Thus, in his author’s note to Nostromo Conrad  thanks José de Avellanos for much of the material recorded in the rest  of the text. Avellanos, however, is a fi ctional being within the novel; we  can thus read this statement of thanks as an ironic gesture that confi rms  rather than dissolves the fi ction/nonfi ction distinction. But Bend Sinis- ter provides a different kind of interpenetration that threatens to prob- lematize the entire fi ction/nonfi ction distinction enshrined in the very  division between novel and preface. Typically, these parts of the text are ontologically distinct, with the  introductory material being nonfi ctional, written by the author, and fal- sifi able in theory, while the novel proper is a work of fi ction, articulated  by a narrator, and not falsifi able. For comparable reasons, the case of  an author seeming to enter into his or her fi ctional work as one of its  characters, as occurs in a number of Nabokovian texts, need not detain  us. As Leona Toker points out, Professor Chateau remarks in the novel  Pnin, apropos of an unusual butterfl y, “Pity Vladimir Vladimirovich is  not here. . . . He would have told us all about these enchanting insects”  (Nabokov 1957: 128; Toker 1989: 25–26). Such intrusions are readily ac- counted for as fi ctional characters that happen to bear the same name  as their authors as opposed to fi ctional names, just as there is a char- 82 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="11"> acter named Chaucer in The Canterbury Tales who is unable to tell a  good story (“The Tale of Sir Thopas”). A historical character, including  the author, is simply another fi ctional character when placed within a  fi ctional storyworld; as Marie-Laure Ryan points out, “the attribute of  fi ctionality does not apply to individual entities, but entire semantic do- mains: the Napoleon of War and Peace is a fi ctional object because he  belongs to a world which is fi ctional” (1991: 15). But something rather different occurs in Bend Sinister. The protago- nist Krug, suffering terribly, is fi nally assuaged by intimations that he is  merely a character in a novel, and that his impending death is thus, in  the words of the author, only “a question of style, a mere literary device,  a musical resolution” (1964: xviii). For some time Krug sensed the pres- ence of a superior being; in his introduction to a later edition (1964),  Nabokov identifi es this fi gure as “an anthropomorphic deity imperson- ated by me” (xviii). That is, the author in a piece of nonfi ction identifi es  the fi ction’s vaguely perceived governing intelligence as himself. Simi- larly, discussing the death of his hero, Nabokov states, “Krug returns  unto the bosom of his maker” (1964: xviii). Here he is not creating a  fi ctional character called Nabokov who may or may not resemble the  historical Vladimir Nabokov, but is referring directly to the person who  created the fi ctional world. The presence sensed by the character would  seem to be the same fi gure that identifi es himself as such in the (nonfi c- tional) introduction. How are we to make sense of these claims? I believe that we must ei- ther agree with Nabokov and admit that he has placed himself as author  within the discourse he has created, or we must, with a zealous formal- ist severity, insist that Nabokov, the real author, only superfi cially (if un- mistakably) resembles the fi ctional character of the perceived author in  the text; one is the ontologically independent simulacrum of the other.  My sympathies are with the fi rst explanation, which remains falsifi able:  the governing intelligence described in the introduction might conceiv- ably not match up with the fi gure in the text. As Lejeune points out, the  autobiographical contract presupposes that an actual person vouches  for the fi delity of the narrative (1982: 211–13); I believe this condition is  met in the example from Bend Sinister. Others, however, might wish to  preserve the distinction between the Nabokov of the introduction and  the authorial presence in the novel—on the basis of larger assumptions  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 83 </page> <page sequence="12"> about the impermeability of fi ctional discourse by nonfi ction. In any  event, Nabokov presents us with a deft paradox: either we are left with  a preposterously close resemblance between the two creator fi gures,  Nabokov impersonating himself, as it were (a position that is very dif- fi cult and possibly pointless to defend), or else the nonfi ctional paratext  breaches the fi ction and becomes one with it at this point. It is precisely  the cross-contamination of these two narrative modes that argues most  strongly for the latter reading, with the nonfi ctional text vouching for  the authenticity of its author’s vague but unmistakable presence in the  fi ctional world. autobiography as intertext Another intriguing intersection of author and narrator is present  in Look at the Harlequins! (1974), which fully develops a strategy that  Nabokov had toyed with in a number of earlier texts, including The  Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941/1959). As you open the fi rst pages of  the volume you fi nd, not the familiar list of other books by the same  author, but instead a list of a dozen “Books by the Narrator.”6 These ti- tles constitute a parodic version of Nabokov’s oeuvre; the Russian works  include Tamara (1925) and Pawn Takes Queen (1927), while the English  volumes include See Under Real (1939) and Ardis (1970). These titles  correspond to Nabokov’s Mashenka (actually published in 1926), King,  Queen, Knave (1928), The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941) and Ada,  or Ardor (1969). To get the joke, here and elsewhere in the book, one  must know the principal details of Nabokov’s career—not just themes  and images, but also dates of publication, changes in residence, number  of divorces, career of his father, and so forth. When the narrator, Vadim  Vadimich, notes that he had employed the pseudonym V. Isirin (1974:  97), the informed reader knows this is a variation of Nabokov’s actual  pseudonym, V. Sirin. The novel’s sudden turn to a second-person ad- dress to the narrator’s beloved likewise mirrors the similar turn made in  the last chapter of Speak, Memory. Nabokov thus takes the public details  of his life and work as an antecedent text to be humorously reworked  in this novel more or less in the same way he uses In Search of Lost Time  as a central framework for Lolita. The story of his life remains a central  “pre-text” of the work, even though the mentally unstable protagonist  84 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="13"> quickly diverges at many key points from his doppelgänger, the author.  As Maurice Couturier has observed, the fi gure of the author emerges  “as a result of the confl ict between the real author and the fi ctional nar- rator, a confl ict arbitrated by the reader familiar with Nabokov’s life and  with his earlier novels. Nabokov encourages us to practice a Sainte-Beu- vean variety of criticism even as we celebrate the author’s death, thus  placing us in a highly paradoxical situation” (1995: 3). An additional twist is provided when we are presented with the  models or clefs of characters who would appear in the later works of  the narrator. Referring to his lover, Iris, the narrator states: “Her cheeks  and arms, without their summer tan, had the mat whiteness that I was  to distribute—perhaps too generously—among the girls of my future  books” (Nabakov 1974: 68). Such an assertion demands a look into com- parable situations in Nabokov’s works. There we fi nd similar examples  but a different pattern: in Speak, Memory Colette, the girl with whom  the very young Nabokov enjoys his fi rst love, has “apricot skin” (1966:  149); Annabel Leigh, the “progenitor” of Lolita, has “honey-colored  skin” (1955/1970: 13) as does her later avatar (41). Thus, Nabokov’s pen- chant for tanned girls is inversely mirrored by the Harlequins’ narrator’s  fi xation on young women with pale skin. The relation is thus some- thing like that of a photograph to its negative, since light and dark are  reversed. This motif, in fact, appears in another transposition of titles;  thus Nabokov’s Laughter in the Dark (originally, Kamera Obskura) is  transmogrifi ed into the narrator’s work, Camera Lucida, or Slaughter in  the Light. To no one’s surprise, the narrator soon becomes haunted by  “a dream feeling that my life was the non-identical twin, a parody, an  inferior variant, of another man’s life” (1974: 89); he is occasionally con- fused with this other author whose name resembles his own and fi nally  fears that he is the fi gment of another’s imagination. Such play with his  identity as an author should perhaps not seem unusual coming from an  author who, by ceasing to write in Russian, “became a phantom in his  own prose, as if, he said, he created the person who wrote in English but  was not himself doing the writing” (Wood 1994: 4). transparent voices We also should acknowledge another important narrative strategy that  may be termed the “transparent voice phenomenon,” in which the most  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 85 </page> <page sequence="14"> unreliable internal narrator can readily (and, more importantly, unam- biguously) articulate the ideas of the author. In such cases, the narra- tor may be temporarily “evacuated” and his character dispensed with as  the author speaks directly (and sometimes incongruously) through that  character’s mouth. Most of Nabokov’s intellectually superior characters  share Nabokov’s contempt for popular culture, psychoanalysis, social- ist realism, and American philistinism, and they express their disdain  in language more reminiscent of Nabokov’s nonfi ctional prose than the  personal styles of the particular characters. Thus, and most implausibly,  the author’s voice even breaks through the second-rate mind of the fat- uous John Ray, the otherwise utterly fallible editor of Humbert’s text in  Lolita. Consider Ray’s condescending reference to “old-fashioned read- ers who wish to follow the destinies of ‘real’ people beyond the ‘true’  story” (1955/1970: 6), or the following more tongue-in-cheek intrusion:  “The commentator may be excused for repeating what he has stressed  in his own books and lectures, namely that ‘offensive’ is frequently but a  synonym for ‘unusual’; and a great work of art is of course always origi- nal, and thus by its very nature should come as a more or less shocking  surprise” (7). These sentiments are the kind frequently found in Nabo- kov’s critical prose and are quite beyond the reach of a middlebrow psy- chiatrist who is much more likely to parrot various slogans of the day  from advertising blurbs for the latest book-of-the-month club selection. It is most suggestive that Sebastian Knight is said to be fond of this  practice of using otherwise unreliable narrators as authorial mouth- pieces: “He had a queer habit of endowing even his most grotesque  characters with this or that idea, or impression, or desire which he  himself might have toyed with” (1941/1959: 114). Because the thoughts  of a narrator cannot always be attributed to the author does not imply  that the latter cannot at times speak through the former. This practice,  which cuts against the grain of accounts that assume an absolute divide  between narrator and author, needs to be more carefully analyzed and  understood within a historical context. After all, it was not that long  ago that authors were criticized for using characters and narrators as  mouthpieces for their own ideas. As Woolf expressed in her critique of  E. M. Forster’s Howards End: “We are tapped on the shoulder. We are to  notice this, or take heed of that. Margaret or Helen, we are made to un- derstand, is not speaking simply as herself; her words have another and  86 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="15"> a larger intention” (1942: 172). Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde were like- wise castigated for using their characters as mere mouthpieces for their  authors’ ideas. We should restore this practice to our critical and theo- retical lexicons. In response to the question “How does one know when  a character is articulating the views of its author?” one can answer: by  comparing the valorization of ideas in a work of fi ction with statements  on the same subjects in nonfi ctional works by the same author. To take  an easy case, tyrants and totalitarian regimes are regularly pilloried in  Nabokov’s fi ction and denounced in his essays. We need not shy away  from pointing out such congruities, though we need to do it with the  care and nuance biographers use when determining the beliefs of their  subjects and also use the sensitivity and suspicion that literary scholars  can bring to the vagaries of acts of narration—and to what those acts  presuppose and entail. authorial interpolation Finally, we may note a last form of self-presentation in fi ction; this tech- nique, like the other four that I discuss, militates against the assump- tion of an impermeable boundary between author and narrator. In Lo- lita, there is a character, Vivian Darkbloom, who inhabits the fi ctional  world but whose name is an anagram of “Vladimir Nabokov.” The same  is true of the characters Vivian Bloodmark and Vivian Calmbrood, who  fi gure in other works. Nabokov criticism has noted many other such  authorial self-representations, involving the letters V or VN, the Russian  phrase for “on the side” (na bok), and numerous other manifestations.7  The primary (if not sole) function of these names is to inject the alpha- betical presence of the author into the text of the fi ction, in the way that  most of Hitchcock’s fi lms include an image of the director unconvinc- ingly portraying a supernumerary character or a most unlikely “man on  the street.” Stephen Dedalus asserts that Shakespeare has subtly intro- jected his presence into his plays: “‘He has hidden his own name, a fair  name, William, in his plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of  old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvass’” (Joyce 1922/1986:  172). Commenting on this passage, Nabokov states, “and this is exactly  what Joyce has done—setting his face in a dark corner of his canvas”  (1980: 319–20). Of course, the same is true for Nabokov. Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 87 </page> <page sequence="16"> Conclusion We may affi rm that the basic distinction between fi ction and nonfi c- tion remains undeniable in most cases. Fictional and nonfi ctional nar- ratives are two very different modes of discourse that perform differ- ent functions and identify themselves (and their ontological status) as  such. We may now return briefl y to the panfi ctionalist position, which  states that all narrativity “shares in the properties of fi ctionality” (Walsh  2007: 39). For Walsh, “the ontological status of the [narrated] events  themselves (and hence, for Cohn, the generic basis for reserving a dis- tinct concept of fi ctionality) comes to seem of marginal interest at best”  (39). In opposition to this position, A. P. Martinich and Avrum Stroll  have convincingly pointed out that just because two groups of entities  share many features, that does not mean that they are indistinguish- able: paintings share many features with photographs, but this does not  mean that paintings are photographs (2007: 3, 69–79). Going further,  if it is admitted that nonfi ctional narrative genres are “constrained by  rules of authentication (documentation, testimony)” (Walsh 2007: 39)  that do not apply to fi ctional genres, this position inadvertently decon- structs itself; by affi rming the different pragmatic status of each nar- rative type, one does all that is needed to affi rm, identify, and explain  the fi ction/nonfi ction distinction. All the texts I have discussed above  (including the two curious short stories and autobiographical chapters)  are designated on their covers or title pages either as fi ction or as be- longing to a nonfi ctional genre and can thus be recognized as perform- ing two very different types of illocutionary act, each of which requires  a different kind of reception. We may conclude by largely reaffi rming  what Dorrit Cohn has called “the distinction of fi ction” (1999: 1–37) and  concur with the recent arguments by Marie-Laure Ryan (1997) and by  Lubomír Doležel (1999) against the doctrine of panfi ctionalism, which  would deny any fundamental difference between fi ctional and nonfi c- tional discourses. The crucial difference between the two modes is, I ar- gue, the question of what Walsh calls “authentication” and what I have  termed falsifi ability. The storyworlds of Bend Sinister, Look at the Harle- quins!, and Lolita remain fi ctional, even though Nabokov has managed  to insinuate his authorial self into these fi ctions in various ways. 88 storyworlds volume 3 2011 </page> <page sequence="17"> Recently there have been a number of scandals involving factual  claims about fi ctive materials. A number of ostensible autobiographers  have been exposed as having invented the lives they purported to have  lived, most theatrically James Frey’s A Million Little Pieces (also known  as A Million Little Lies), and, most egregiously, Stolen Soul by Bernard  Holstein, the story of the Jewish man’s escape from the holocaust—ex- cept that his last name was not Holstein, but Brougham, he was not  Jewish, and he wasn’t in Germany during the war but rather lived in  Australia. These and many other similar examples testify to the impor- tance of the fi ction/nonfi ction distinction, and the scandals provoked  by these texts reveal the stakes of calling a work fi ction or nonfi ction.  The achievement of Nabokov is not to demolish this opposition but to  manipulate it in subtle and cunning ways that produce novel responses;  indeed, one needs the distinction in order to appreciate and articulate  Nabokov’s impressive maneuvers. This division between the fi ctional and nonfi ctional is often clear- cut, as Lejeune (1982) affi rms, but it is not always so; there are, as Ryan  (1997) and Doležel (1999) both admit, certain gray areas or open bound- aries involving hybrid modes. Nabokov’s examples show that some texts  will legitimately be able to be read either as fi ction or autobiography,  some will straddle or blur the divide, some inject nonfi ctional discourse  into the text of a novel, and some readjust the boundary between frame  and fi ction. Together, these phenomena indicate the rare and unusual  ways in which the author of a book can unnaturally merge with the  narrator of a work of fi ction. Notes  Earlier versions of this paper were read at the International Vladimir Nabokov  Society panel at the MLA convention in Washington, DC, on December 30,  2005, and to the Fictionality Study Group at York University (UK) in June 2009.  I am grateful to the Nabokov panel chair, Zoran Kuzmanovich, and to both  audiences for helpful comments and sustained discussion of the issues raised. 1.  José Ángel García Landa, in a masterful account of the powerful autobiograph- ical resonances of several texts, including the short story “Christmas,” articu- lates an important aspect of Nabokov’s oeuvre: “The works thus communicate,  between the lines, elements of experience which acquire their full meaning  Richardson: Nabokov’s Experiments 89 </page> <page sequence="18"> when they are read as projections and transformations of the author’s personal  experience, and not merely as the experience transmitted by an ‘intrinsic’ read- ing of the work” (2005: 274). 2.  As Nabokov remarks in the bibliographical note to Nabokov’s Dozen, “‘Made- moiselle O’ and ‘First Love’ are (except for a change in names) true in every  detail to the author’s remembered life’” (1995: 662). 3.  Lubomír Doležel, utilizing possible-worlds semantics in his essay “Fictional  and Historical Narrative: Meeting the Postmodernist Challenge” (1999), affi rms  that nonfi ctional worlds are marked by epistemological gaps, while fi ctional  worlds have ontological gaps. Nabokov’s paradoxical practice here confi rms  Doležel’s thesis: Nabokov could have continued to invent the exploits of his  characters as fi ctional entities, and he could have fi lled in additional historical  background of the actual people involved. Once again, only the latter would  have been falsifi able. 4.  For a fascinating discussion of the possibility of texts moving from the category  of fi ction to nonfi ction, see Kai Mikkonen (2006). 5.  The case of Babel is still more paradoxical since some of the “autobiographical”  events are invented, and historical individuals are quoted as vouching for the  accuracy of the stories, as Stanton (2001) explains. 6.  This practice seems to parody Lejeune’s comment that the author is “a personal  name, the identical name accepting responsibility for a sequence of different  published texts. He derives his reality from the list of his other works which is  often to be found at the beginning of the book under the heading ‘by the same  author’” (1982: 200). 7.  For a thorough discussion and bibliography of this phenomenon, see Gavriel  Shapiro (1999), who also quotes the passage on Joyce that I cite below.
