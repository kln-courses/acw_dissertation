Radiation exposures to the scalp during childhood for tinea capitis were associated with a fourfold increase in skin cancer, primarily basal cell carcinomas, and a threefold increase in be- nign skin tumors. Malignant melanoma, however, was not sig- nificantly elevated. Overall, 80 neoplasms were identified from an extensive search of the pathology logs of all major hospitals in Israel and computer linkage with the national cancer registry. Radiation dose to the scalp was computed for over 10,000 per- sons irradiated for ringworm (mean 7 Gy), and incidence rates were contrasted with those observed in 16,000 matched compari- son subjects. The relative risk of radiogenic skin cancer did not differ significantly between men or women or by time since ex- posure; however, risk was greatest following exposures in early childhood. After adjusting for sex, ethnic origin, and attained age, the estimated excess relative risk was 0.7 per Gy and the average excess risk over the current follow-up was 0.31/104 PY- Gy. The risk per Gy of radiation-induced skin cancer was inter- mediate between the high risk found among whites and no risk found among blacks in a similar study conducted in New York City (Shore et al., Radiat. Res. 100, 192-204, 1984). This find- ing suggests the role that subsequent exposure to uv radiation likely plays in the expression of a potential radiation-induced skin malignancy. ? 1991 Academic Press, Inc. skin malignancies in 2200 children irradiated for ringworm of the scalp compared to 1400 children treated with other modalities. They have reported a relative risk of 3.8 and an absolute risk of 2.3/104 persons per year per Gy at an aver- age skin dose of 4.5 Gy (10). The association between radia- tion and skin cancer was seen only among whites, suggest- ing that an interaction with ultraviolet radiation might be important. An increase in skin cancer, mostly basal cell carcinoma, has also been found among children irradiated for an enlarged thymus gland (12), radiologists (13, 14), and uranium workers (15), but not among patients irradiated for ankylosing spondylitis (16), tuberculosis (17), or post- partum mastitis (17). Initial reports from the studies of the A-bomb survivors showed no increased risk of skin cancer (18). However, a recent report by Sadamori et al. (19) sug- gested a relationship between skin cancer incidence and distance from the hypocenter in Nagasaki, although not for those closest to the detonation. The Israel tinea capitis study offered the chance to evalu- ate skin cancer incidence in relation to radiation dose to the scalp, temporal patterns over approximately 25 years of fol- low-up, and possible effect modifiers. In addition, this study provided the opportunity to study radiation effects in a population of medium skin color that had extensive expo- sure to uv radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population. The study population consists of 10,834 persons who received X-ray therapy for tinea capitis between 1948 and 1960; 10,834 nonirradiated population subjects; and 5392 nonirradiated siblings (Table I). All of the irradiated subjects were less than 16 years old at treat- ment. Study subjects either immigrated to Israel from Africa or Asia (mostly the Middle East) or were born in Israel to a father who had emi- grated from Africa or Asia. For each irradiated subject, a nonirradiated, tinea-free subject matched on sex, age (?2 years), country of birth, and year of immigration to Israel (?1 year) was chosen from the general popula- tion using the Central Population Registry. For 50% of the irradiated sub- jects, a nonirradiated, tinea-free sibling matched on age (?5 years), country of origin, and year of immigration (+1 year), with preference given to siblings of the same sex, was also selected. An evaluation of passport con- trol and Population Registry data in 1982 suggests that about 5% of the study population has emigrated from Israel. The percentage of persons emigrating did not differ significantly among the three study groups. INTRODUCTION From as early as 1902 (1), there have been case reports and hospital series of radiation-induced skin cancer (2-9). While very high doses have been linked conclusively to skin cancer, few investigations have been able to quantify this risk in terms of absorbed dose to skin, and it is not clear whether low or moderate exposures are carcinogenic.

Hospital pathology records were searched to identify nonmelanoma skin cancer and benign skin neoplasms of the head and neck area diagnosed between 1950 and 1980. Specially trained ab- stractors searched the pathology logs of each of the 22 hospitals with pathol- ogy departments in Israel. Names and identifying data for every patient with a biopsy indicating a malignant or benign neoplasm of the head and neck area diagnosed between 1950 and 1980 were recorded. Over two million pathology reports were reviewed, of which 59,000 either met the age and ethnic origin criteria of the study or had insufficient demographic or clinical data for the determination of eligibility. These records were abstracted, computerized, and linked to the study cohort. Finally, the en- tire roster of study subjects was linked to the Central Population Registry which records the vital status of each Israeli citizen and permanent resi- dent. All but one subject were successfully matched and date of death was abstracted for deceased study subjects. Cause of death was obtained from the Registry files. Three melanoma patients were identified through death certificates as well as through the Cancer Registry or hospital search. Tumors were classified according to the oncology guidelines of the Inter- national Classification of Diseases for Oncology (20) and included topogra- phy code 173 and behavior codes 0-3. The nonmelanoma skin cancer category included basal cell carcinoma (morphology codes 8090/1,3- 8095/3), squamous cell carcinoma (8070/3-8081/2), and epithelial cell cancer (8010/3). The benign skin category included benign sweat gland adenomas (8400/0), basal cell benign tumors (8096/0-8110/0), dermatofi- bromas (8832/0), benign nevi (8720/0-8790/0), and skin cylindromas (8200/0). Dosimetry. Patients received radiotherapy according to the Adamson- Kienbock technique, a five-field treatment of the scalp, with lead shielding on the face and neck. Patients were treated at four centers, using X-ray machines with beams of 70-100 kVp, 0.5 mm Al filter, and 1.0 mm Al half-value layer used for irradiation of superficial tissues. One course of therapy typically involved 375 roentgens in air to each field, delivered on 5 consecutive days. The prescribed exposure ranged from 350 to 400 roent- gens, depending upon the treatment center. About 9% of the patients re- ceived two or more treatments. Detailed reports of the Israeli treatment techniques and dosimetry have been published (21, 22). Scalp doses were estimated for individual patients, based on data mea- sured by Schulz and Albert (23). Their measurements, expressed as expo- sure in air at the skin surface, were made using an anthropomorphic phan- tom representative of a 6-year-old child, duplicating treatment conditions. For this study, these measurements were converted to absorbed dose to the skin. Because the absorbed doses varied widely at different scalp locations, the minimum, maximum, and average doses for each patient were calcu- lated, depending upon the number of courses of therapy that the patient received and the prescribed radiation techniques used at the center where treatment occurred. Dose-response analyses were based on each individ- ual's average scalp dose. For children receiving one course of therapy the average dose to the scalp was 6.1 Gy (range 5.5 to 6.7). The mean of the individual minimum and maximum doses was 4.4 and 7.8 Gy, respectively. Including patients who received more than one course of therapy, the estimated mean average dose was 6.8 Gy (range 5.5 to 24.4 Gy). Statistical analysis. The analyses focused on basal cell carcinomas (BCC) because the number of non-basal cell carcinomas and benign skin tumors was small. The data for BCC were cross-classified by sex, ethnic origin (Israeli-born, African-born, Asian-born), age at exposure (0-4, 5-9, 10-15 years), time since exposure (0-4, 5-9, ? . . 30+ years), calendar time (1950-54, 1955-59, ? ? &amp; 1975-80), scalp dose in Gy (0, 5.5, 6.1, 6.7, 11.4-24.4), and number of X-ray treatments (1, 2, 3+). For each stratum person-years, tumor counts, person-year-weighted average values for dose, attained age, age at exposure, and time since exposure were computed. There were 2670 data cells with at least one person at risk. Person-years of observation were computed from the date of first treat- ment for tinea capitis, or the equivalent date for the matched comparison subjects, until the date of tumor diagnosis, date of death, or the study end of follow-up date (December 31, 1980), whichever occurred first. Alto- gether, 662,950 person-years of observation were accrued with a mean follow-up time of 24.5. Because radiation-induced skin neoplasia likely have at least a 10-year latent period (10, 24), the first 10 years of follow-up were excluded from the detailed analyses, leaving 393,220 person-years of observation. Poisson regression methods were used to compute maximum likelihood estimates for both relative and absolute excess risks (25). Parameter esti- mates, likelihood-ratio tests, and likelihood-based confidence intervals (26) were computed using AMFIT, a program for the analysis of general rate models with grouped cohort data (27). Various factors which might affect the risk of skin neoplasia were consid- ered in the models used in these analyses. These factors include sex, at- tained age, age at exposure, time since exposure, ethnic origin, and radia- tion dose. If we let X(z, d, 3) represent the risk of skin cancer as a function of various covariates, including time, denoted by z, radiation dose, by d, and parameters to be estimated by /, the additive relative risk model used for most of these analyses can be written as X(z, d, 0) = X(z, 0/3)[1 + 6(d, 3d)f(Ze, ee)], where the functions Xo0(), 6(-), and E(-) describe the background rates, dose-response function, and effect modification, respectively; the covar- iate vectors zo and ze are not necessarily distinct. The background rates and effect modification were modeled as log-lin- ear functions, i.e., exp(oz). The dose-response function was modeled as a linear function of dose; however, in testing for an exposure effect, a binary indicator of exposure status was used in place of dose, and in testing for nonlinearity a quadratic term for dose was added to the linear dose-re- sponse model. RESULTS Total Skin Tumor Incidence Skin tumors of the head and neck, including melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and benign skin tumors in 58 irradiated subjects, 16 matched comparison subjects, and 6 nonirradiated siblings were biopsied (Table II).

Forty-two nonmelanoma skin malignancies occurred among the irra- diated subjects, compared with 15 among the two compari- son groups combined (RR = 4.2; 95% CI = 2.3-7.6; abso- lute risk = 1.2 per 10,000 person-years; 95% CI = 0.8-1.7). Among the carcinomas in the irradiated subjects, all but one (98%) were of the basal cell type. Among the nonirra- diated patients, 13 of the 15 (87%) were basal cell tumors. Benign skin tumors occurred more than three times more often among the exposed subjects than the nonexposed (RR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.3-9.1). Benign sweat gland tumors occurred most frequently, but the radiogenic risk was higher for benign basal cell tumors. Other benign tumors of the head and neck included 6 papillomas, 11 hemangiomas, 15 lipomas, 9 fibromas, 2 myomatous neoplasms, and 2 lymphatic vessel tumors among the irradiated subjects, compared with 13 papillo- mas, 13 hemangiomas, 4 lipomas, 2 fibromas, 1 myoma- tous neoplasm, and 1 lymphatic vessel tumor among the comparisons. These data suggest that there may be an in- creased risk of lipomas and fibromas, but not of papillomas or hemangiomas. Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer Among the irradiated subjects the incidence of nonmel- anoma skin cancer was 1.6 per 10,000 persons per year of follow-up, compared to 0.4 for the comparison subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in inci- dence rates by sex or ethnic origin among the comparison subjects (Table III). The mean age at diagnosis of nonmel- anoma skin cancer was 27.3 years for the exposed group compared to 30.6 for the nonexposed patients. The mean interval between irradiation and diagnosis (or study entry for the comparison subjects) was 21.6 and 22.6 years, re- spectively. One epithelial cell and one basal cell carcinoma were diagnosed less than 5 years after radiation treatment. Patients developing benign skin tumors appeared to be slightly younger (mean age at diagnosis = 24.5) and there- fore also had a shorter interval between treatment and diag- nosis. Among the exposed patients, 53% of the nonmelanoma skin cancers with known location developed on the scalp, the target radiation area, compared to 36% among the com- parisons (Table IV). The location of the benign skin tumors was similar: 50 and 33% occurred on the scalp of the irra- diated and nonirradiated patients, respectively. Basal Cell Carcinoma To further evaluate tumor risk in relation to radiation dose and effect modification, detailed analysis of the basal cell carcinomas was performed using relative and absolute risk models. These regression analyses were restricted to the 40 irradiated and 13 comparison subjects with BCC diag- nosed at least 10 years after irradiation or study entry. After adjusting the background rate for sex, ethnic origin, and attained age, the relative risk of BCC for the irradiated sub- jects, without regard to radiation dose, was 4.9 (95% CI = 2.6-8.9), while the average excess risk over the current TABLE III Selected Characteristics of Nonmelanoma Head and Neck Skin Tumors by Tumor Behavior Malignant .Benign Characteristic Irradiated Comparison Irradiated Comparison Sex (number)a Male 19(1.46) 8 (0.40) 2 (0.15) 2 (0.10) Female 23 (1.70) 7 (0.35) 12 (0.89) 4 (0.20) Ethnic origin (number)a African-born 17 (1.09) 9 (0.39) 9 (0.58) 0 (0.00) Asian-born 15 (2.69) 4 (0.46) 3 (0.54) 4 (0.46) Israeli-born 10 (1.86) 2 (0.25) 2 (0.37) 2 (0.25) Age at diagnosis (years) Mean 27.3 30.6 24.6 24.3 Range 11-38 17-40 11-34 4-39 Interval between radiation and diagnosis (years) Mean 21.2 22.6 18.8 17.5 Range 3-29 12-29 8-25 3-28 a Rate per 10,000 persons per year of follow-up in parentheses.</page><page sequence="4">SKIN TUMORS AFTER RADIATION THERAPY 321 TABLE IV Anatomical Location of Nonmelanoma Head and Neck Skin Tumors Irradiated Population Sibling subjects comparisons comparisons Malignant Eyelid 1 0 0 Ear 4 0 1 Face 8 4 2 Neck 4 0 0 Scalp 19 4 0 Unknown 6 4 0 Benign Eyelid 1 2 0 Ear 1 0 0 Face 3 0 0 Neck 2 0 2 Scalp 7 1 1 follow-up was 2.0 (95% CI = 1.3-2.6) per 10,000 persons per year. Effect modification was considered separately for relative and absolute risk models. The background was modeled including effects for ethnicity, sex, and attained age. Back- ground rates increased rapidly with attained age (propor- tional to the sixth or seventh power of age), but there was little evidence of statistically significant variability with sex and ethnic origin. The relative and absolute models fit the data equally well, but the relative risk model required only one effect modifier (age at exposure) to describe the excess risk adequately, whereas in the absolute risk model, age at exposure, ethnic origin, and time since exposure were all important effect modifiers. Dose response. An evaluation of risk of BCC in relation to scalp dose demonstrated a significant linear dose re- sponse (P &lt; 0.001). When number of radiation treatments was used as a measure of dose, a dose response was also seen. Tests for nonlinearity in the dose response, for all subjects and among the exposed subjects only, were not significant. However, because the lowest doses received by exposed subjects are in excess of 5 Gy, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Using a linear dose-response model, the fitted relative risk for a person irradiated at age 7 rose from 5.4 at 5.5 Gy to 11.3 at 13.0 Gy (Fig. 1). Looking at the adjusted relative risks, the risk appeared to level off in the highest dose group (mean 13.0 Gy). Age at exposure. Age at irradiation ranged from less than 1 year to 15 years, allowing a limited assessment of age-at-exposure effects. The risk per unit dose of radiogenic BCC increased significantly with decreasing age at expo- sure. As mentioned above, age at exposure was the only significant effect modifier in the final relative risk model. Under this model, a 5-year decrease in the age at exposure leads to an 80% decrease in the relative risk. Based upon the expected numbers of cancers computed using this model, the fitted relative risks for children irradiated between the ages of 1-4, 5-9, and 10-14 were 19.0, 5.9, and 2.0, respec- tively (Table V). Sex and ethnic origin. The relative risk for females was slightly higher than for males; however, the confidence in- tervals overlapped considerably and the difference in risks was not significant. Although the estimated relative risk for persons born in Israel was substantially higher than for those born in Asia or Africa, this finding was related in large part to the younger age at exposure for the Israeli-born sub- jects (4.0 for Israeli-born vs 8.0 years for Asian- or African- born) (Table V). When age at exposure was taken into ac- count, place of birth, which is an indicator of ethnic origin, did not appear to be a significant factor in susceptibility to radiation-induced BCC. Time since exposure. Allowing for a 10-year minimum latent period, there was some evidence of a slight decline over time in the observed adjusted relative risk; however, this trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.5) (Table V). In interpreting the results one must bear in mind that in the earlier years of follow-up the risks were very poorly esti- mated due to the small number of tumors diagnosed, whereas in the 25+ category the estimate was unstable due to the large drop in the number of person-years of follow- up. The fitted risks show that risk remained fairly stable throughout the study period. The observed and fitted absolute excess risks were very similar until the last period of the study. Based on the small number of person-years available after 25 years of follow- up, the observed risk declined slightly; however, tests for departures from the fitted model provided no evidence against a continual increase over the entire study period (6) (3)(18)(13) (6) 25 20- - 15 I 10 5 oI 0 3 6 9 12 15 Dose (Gyl FIG. 1.

The difference in risk estimates for Israeli- and non-Israeli-born subjects reflects the difference in the mean age at exposure. (Fig. 2). A time-dependent excess risk model with allow- ance for dose-effect modification by ethnicity and age at exposure suggests that the excess risks are increasing pro- portional to time since exposure to the fourth power. For example, at 10 years since exposure the excess risk was esti- mated to be increasing by about 50% per year, while at 20 years postexposure, the risks were increasing by about 20% each year. DISCUSSION Moderate levels of ionizing radiation used to treat tinea capitis in childhood (mean 6.8 Gy) significantly increased the risk of basal cell carcinomas. The relative risk at 1 Gy was estimated as 1.7 and the absolute excess as 0.31/104 PY-Gy. The excess risk of BCC during the period from 10 to 30 years after irradiation in childhood is best described by a linear dose-response model in which the relative risk varies inversely with age at exposure but is constant over time since exposure and does not differ with sex. The best- fitting relative risk model is RR (d, a) = 1 + 0.28 d exp[-0.34(a - 10)], where dis dose and a is age at exposure. However, although a dose-response relationship was sug- gested, it also should be stressed that because no skin doses were below 5 Gy, we cannot address the possibility of a threshold effect for skin cancer based on our results. Al- though our study provided the opportunity to quantify the risk of BCC according to estimated radiation dose to the scalp, it should be pointed out that tumors also occurred on the face, neck, ear, and eyelid. Unfortunately, the tumor location information was imprecise, and therefore it was not possible to estimate the dose to the tissue in the actual location of the tumor. Risk appeared to level off in the highest dose group. Al- though the risk in this group was not significantly different</page><page sequence="6">SKIN TUMORS AFTER RADIATION THERAPY 323 (3) (6) (25) (6) S2 0.5- 0 a -0 .5 10 15 20 25 30 Time Since Exposure FIG. 2.

Point estimates are also repre- sented for the fitted excess risks (A). Numbers in parentheses are numbers of exposed cases. from those in the lower dose categories, laboratory studies suggest that the addition of uv radiation to ionizing radia- tion can result in fewer tumors at higher doses (28). Burns and Albert (28) postulate that in rats very high doses of uv radiation may result in sterilization. Age at irradiation ranged from less than 1 year to 15 years, allowing a limited assessment of age-at-exposure ef- fects. However, the risk of radiogenic BCC per unit dose increased significantly with decreasing age at exposure. These results, taken in conjunction with findings from anal- yses of radiation-associated thyroid tumors (29), suggest that young children are particularly susceptible to develop- ing radiation-induced tumors. The reasons for this in- creased susceptibility are not entirely clear. In young chil- dren who are growing there is more cell proliferation than in adults. Cell proliferation is important in a number of different ways. First, cells in cycle are more susceptible to the induction of the initial lesions. Second, if DNA synthe- sis occurs before repair of the initial lesions, they will be fixed and transmitted to daughter cells at cell division. Third, proliferation is required for the expansion of the clone of altered cells. On the other hand, experimental stud- ies with rats do not indicate that cell proliferation rates af- fect the tumor yield of skin cancers (28). Perhaps the youth- ful age at exposure allows more time for concomitant fac- tors, such as uv radiation, to promote the progression to carcinogenesis. Another possibility is that very young children may have been more restless than older children and consequently their dose estimates may be less accurate. Attempts to mea- sure the effect of movement during treatment on the dose to the thyroid indicated that the dose increased from about 6 to 9 cGy (21). Because the scalp was in the primary beam, movement would not increase the scalp dose substantially; however, if younger children did move more frequently than older children, their doses might be slightly higher than those estimated. The finding that the excess risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer was confined to basal cell carcinomas and was more pronounced in tumors occurring on the scalp is consistent with what is known about basal and squamous cell carci- noma. Basal cell carcinoma may occur subsequent to low or moderate radiation doses, as in the tinea capitis patients, whereas squamous cell carcinoma appears to develop after exposure to high doses of radiation, often associated with radiodermatitis. In addition, basal cell cancers are usually found in the head and neck, whereas squamous cell carci- nomas frequently occur in the extremities (8, 17). A similar study of patients with scalp ringworm treated in New York City during childhood also found an excess of skin cancers of the head and neck (10, 11). However, the reported risk was much higher than in our series (2.3 vs 0.31/104 PY-Gy). The reasons for this discrepancy are not apparent, but might be due to differences in dose estima- tion, tumor ascertainment, or skin color. In the New York series, an average dose for the entire study cohort was calcu- lated rather than individual doses. The dose for one treat- ment in the New York series (11) was lower (4.4 Gy vs 6.1 Gy) than in ours; however, using the dose in the New York study would have increased our risk estimate only slightly, to 0.43 per 104 PY-Gy. Our study also differed in the man- ner of ascertaining skin cancers (pathology records vs ques- tionnaire). Although there was no evidence to suggest dif- ferential reporting of skin cancers in the New York study, an elevated risk would result if exposed subjects were more likely to respond or report skin cancers than nonexposed subjects. Since age at exposure is an important effect modi- fier, it could be a reason for the different findings. However, the mean age in the two series (7 and 8 years old for the Israeli and New York series, respectively) is similar, and therefore would not account for the disparity in risk esti- mates. Another, possibly more important, factor is the differ- ence in the natural incidence of skin cancer in the two co- horts, and the effect of uv radiation as a cocarcinogen. The cumulative incidence of BCC among the Israeli compari- son subjects was 0.3 per 10,000 persons per year compared to 1.1 in the New York series. Although Israelis are proba- bly exposed to more sun than persons living in the New York area, the study subjects' skin is generally darker, and thus filters out the uv component of sunlight, protecting against skin cancer. The population of the Israeli tinea capitis study includes persons of North African and Middle Eastern origin, who have highly pigmented skin, in general, and low melanoma rates. Interestingly, the New York study observed no skin cancers among approximately 550 irradiated and 350 non- irradiated black subjects. Shore et al. (10) found that white subjects with light complexions had a higher risk of develop-</page><page sequence="7">324 RON ET AL. ing skin cancer and hypothesized that uv radiation is an important cofactor for radiogenic skin cancers. Albert and Shore (17) suggest that the low sensitivity of darker-skinned people to uv radiation may explain the lack of radiation-in- duced skin tumors among blacks in the New York tinea study and Japanese A-bomb survivors. Stern et al. (30) found that patients who sunburn easily and tan poorly have a higher risk of developing skin cancer after treatment with methoxsalen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) than those with skin types which rarely sunburn and tan well. Burns and Albert (28) demonstrated that uv radiation enhanced the induction of skin cancers at relatively low doses of ionizing radiation in experimental settings. Our data also suggest that exposure to sunlight is an important ingredient in the development of radiation-induced BCC at moderate skin doses, since the Israeli population had an intermediate excess risk. Scotto et al. (31) reported that U.S. males are at greater risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer than females. We found a slightly higher cumulative incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer among the nonexposed male subjects (male to fe- male ratio = 1.1). Although we found no statistically signifi- cant effect modification by sex, among exposed subjects the male to female ratio decreased to 0.8. A major strength of our study is the method of tumor ascertainment. Basal cell carcinomas are difficult to ascer- tain because they are usually nonfatal and are not reported to tumor registries. Most studies, therefore, rely on self-re- porting through questionnaires and can be subject to over- or underreporting biases. The Israeli study obtained infor- mation on skin tumor incidence by an intensive search of the pathology records of the 22 general hospitals in Israel. Records of patients fitting the age criteria for the tinea capi- tis study were abstracted, and this roster of potential study subjects was then linked by computer to the study file, while exposure status was still unknown. This method is advan- tageous for several reasons: there is complete tumor ascer- tainment; there is little chance of bias due to overascertain- ment among the exposed; there is no recall bias as is often associated with questionnaire information; and because all tumors were surgically removed there is confirmation of all diagnoses. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are indebted to the members of the pathology and medical records departments of the hospitals in Israel, who willingly allowed us access to their records, gave advice, and provided space for our abstracters to work; to the staff of the Central Population Registry and the Labor Federation Sick Fund for their assistance in correcting and updating identification data used in record linkage; and especially to the research staff, Ms. Judith Avishai, Ms. Angela Chetrit, Ms. Judith Ovadia (deceased), Ms. Michal Peretz, Ms. Etti Raviv, Ms. Rachel Rosenblatt, and Ms. Lorice Yankele- vitz, who spent so many years working on this project.
