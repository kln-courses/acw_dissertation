<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD TILLINGHAST Islamic Art at the V&amp;A THE OPENING OF THE JAMEEL GALLERY OF ISLAMIc ART at London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum last year, after three years of preparation, had long been anticipated. Looking at Islamic art at the V&amp;A, even as inade quately as it was previously displayed, has always been one of the pleasures of visiting the great museum in South Kensington. The new gallery is named after a Saudi benefactor, the late Abdul LatifJameel. In view of the worldwide crisis in which a distorted and destructive inter pretation of Islam plays such an alarming role, the opening of this collection is timely for political and cultural reasons as well as for the inherent appeal of this marvelous body of material. The art on display here echoes the Prophet Muhammad's saying "God is beautiful and He loves beauty." The diverse but linked cultures of those countries that profess Islam flowered gloriously for well over twelve hundred years. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632, empires that conquered in the name of the new faith, the third "revealed" religion to come out of the Middle East, spread rapidly. By 750 Islamic empires stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the borders of India. This unified culture only began to disin tegrate finally with the breakup of the Ottoman Empire in the years leading up to and following the First World War. The challenge to chief curator Tim Stanley and his colleagues was how to present a panorama of art from these cultures and how to display it all in one gallery-albeit an enormous gallery the size of a great banqueting hall in a castle. By comparison, the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, which has the greatest gathering of Islamic art in Europe, is able to devote sixteen smaller rooms to its peerless collection, which occupies an entire floor in one wing of the museum. In advance of my first visit to the gallery, I wondered how the space could be made to harmonize with the museum's Victorian architecture. The ideal ceiling for a room full of Islamic art would be a dome, given the importance of domes in mosque architecture beginning with the Dome of the Rock, 684-92, built in Al-Quds (Jerusalem) under the Umayyad dynasty, when Arab architects first adapted Byzantine-Roman forms. The Jameel Gallery, by contrast, is a long rectangle topped by a vaulted ceiling. I gasped with pleasure as soon as I entered the gallery with its serene indigo-blue ceiling--perfect for the exquisite blues and greens in many</page><page sequence="2">294 THE HUDSON REVIEW of the tiles on display here-which floats above the collection, support ed by round-arched colonnades running down each side of the room. It hadn't occurred to me how much continuity there was between Islamic architecture and that of the Christian Middle Ages. Romanesque arches traveled both to the eastern Mediterranean and northwest into pre Gothic Europe. The great imperial mosques built by the architect Mimar Sinan in Istanbul were modeled on Haghia Sophia, itself a bridge between classical antiquity and medieval Byzantium. In turn Islamic architecture provided models for the Gothic architecture of late medieval Europe, which began by imitating the Islamic styles traders and crusaders would have seen in Moorish Spain and in the Holy Land. Islamic art is all about pattern. One can see what an inspiration it was to William Morris, one of the patron saints of the V&amp;A. A common misconception about Islamic art is that the Qur'an prohibits the portrayal of human forms. In fact, this prohibition does not appear in the Qur'an but is a product of custom and tradition. Islam saw itself as the successor to Judaism and Christianity, absorbing into its traditions one ofJudaism's Ten Commandments: "Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth" (Deuteronomy 5:8). About half the art on display in the Jameel Gallery is figurative, particularly those works not designed for specifically religious purposes. The emphasis on pattern derives from a vision of the nature of God. Every novice etymologist knows that our word algebra derives from Arabic al-jebr, which roughly translates as "reunification." One can see how this notion relates to solving an equation; but it also points to one of the essentials of Islamic theology. As expounded by the great Andalusian mystic Ibn 'Arabi, whose writing spanned the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the world God created remains a part of God, and so when man sets out to know the nature of the divinity, this means that one part of God-a separated or estranged part-is attempting to know another part. An almost identical idea forms the central theme of the Turkish mysticJelaluddin Rumi's long poem, the Mesnevi. Islamic artists have tended to see in the multiplicity of natural forms evidence of God's infinitude. A design of vines or flowers leads quite naturally to a geometric exploration of pattern, seen as a visual manifestation of divinity. This collection allows us to see the origins of a geometrical, pattern-obsessed Islamic style beginning to emerge from the art of classical antiquity. In two tenth-century marble capitals from Cordoba, Roman acanthus motifs-familiar from Greek, Roman and Byzantine decoration-have started to morph into less naturalistic, more geometrical forms, which are already moving in the direction of decorating surfaces and becom ing less three dimensional. Around the top of the capitals runs a frieze of Arabic script. The words of the Qur'an are considered sacred; in their visual form they are never mere decoration but occupy a space somewhere between art and revelation. The gallery contains many fine</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD TILLINGHAST 295 examples of Qur'anic calligraphy in several different scripts. Among the styles represented here are the old, angular Kufic script named after the city of Kufa, in present-day Iraq; the softer, more curved and flowing forms of the style called Nashi; the graceful and majestic Thuluth; and finally the Diwani style developed at the Ottoman court. Though the Qur'an and the Hadiths are full of stories, Islam is a less narrative religion than Hinduism, where we find vivid characters like Radha and the blue-skinned Krishna, with their ecstatic courtship. Or Judaism, peopled by patriarchs like Moses, who stood tongue-tied before the manifestation of God in a burning bush, and Abraham, whom God told, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore." Or Christianity, with characters like Peter, who denied his Lord three times before the cock could crow, as prophesied; or Judas, who betrayed Him with a kiss. There is no anthropomorphic 'jealous God," no "God the Father" in Islam; Allah is a more abstract entity with ninety-nine names, each capturing one facet of the whole. True, there is a narrative surrounding the revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad, but the religion emphasizes the substance rather than the circumstances of the revelation. After all, the speaker in the Qur'an is God Himself. Islam is founded, like Buddhism, not on narrative, but on a set of assertions about the nature of reality. This is particularly striking when one compares its art with Byzantine painting or with the medieval and early Renaissance Italian art that derived from Byzantium, which celebrate stories like Christ's passion or the story of Mary, who though a woman, in some mysterious way became the Mother of God. In a fourteenth-century silk piece from Granada, the transition from classical art to the aesthetic universe that would stretch across the Islamic world is complete. The predominant colors of this design are maize and rose-madder, with lines drawn in black, cream, lavender and piney green to create an intricate web that pulls the piece together. Each segment of the design contains an eight-pointed star, a quatrefoil, and two roundels. In the interstices of the maize-colored web are fleurs de-lis and tiny fanciful knots. Behind the mind that created this fabric is a love of intricacy and a craftsmanship that suggests infinite patience. The V&amp;A's Turkish holdings give a glimpse into the aesthetic riches that were created during the Ottoman centuries, based on the fabulous wealth derived from this vast empire, the traditions of design and crafts manship of its peoples, and the skills of the painters, architects, tile men, stonecarvers and calligraphers who were drawn to the patronage of the sultans. Ushak carpets from the fifteenth century contain patterns familiar to Europeans from their appearance in paintings by Hans Holbein, Lorenzo Lotto and others. From Bursa, an early capital of the empire before the Turks captured Constantinople, comes seventeenth-century Ottoman embroidery of exquisite taste and delicacy, including a design of lush, stylized carna</page><page sequence="4">296 THE HUDSON REVIEW tions, their color shading subtly from buff to silver as the light catches it, all against a burgundy field. The appearance here of kaftans sewn for Ottoman princes is made poignant for the student of Ottoman history who remembers that the nineteen younger sons of Sultan Murad III were strangled late one night in 1595 to prevent dynastic disputes when their half-brother Mehmet III came to the throne. As in Renaissance Florence, Rome, Milan and Venice, the utmost artistic delicacy often lives side by side with cruelty and brutality. Turkish architecture, the most lasting achievement of the Ottomans, cannot of course be represented here, though there is a pleasant video tour of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul that one may watch. And to get a sense of the glories of traditional Turkish carpets, one would want to see the collection in Berlin. There is, however, some exquisite tile work here from Iznik (the Turkish name for Nicaea, where the Nicene Creed was formulated). The tile-makers at Iznik favored stylized floral designs such as the tree of life, the aforementioned carnations, and tulips, which gave their name to the Lale Devri or Tulip Period, a flowering of culture and luxury in Ottoman court circles in the eighteenth century. Yet one of the strangest and most attractive of these designs is what the Turks call cintimani, derived from a Sanskrit word meaning "precious jewel" (as in the Tibetan mantra Om mani padme hum). The design was used on the silk kaftans on display here as well as at the Topkapi Palace. There are good examples of its use on tiles in the harem at Topkapi and especially in the tomb of Eyup al-Ensari on the Golden Horn. An annotation here at the V&amp;A calls into question the East Asian connection, describing cintimani as "animal pelt designs" and asserting that "pairs of wavy lines and groups of three large dots represent the pelts of the striped tiger and spotted leopard." No doubt this descrip tion reflects recent scholarship on the subject, but it is hard not to think that the groups of three dots do not have some different meaning in the Turkish scheme of things. The individual dots bear a remarkable resem blance to the nazar boncugu, those blue beads meant to ward off the Evil Eye which one sees everywhere in Turkey. The way the wavy lines and three dots are deployed on these tiles would never in a million years suggest tigers and leopards; they instead have all the elegance of a Chinese design, and I think they must derive from the Chinese porce lains that were such an influence on Turkish ceramic design. And yet if the origins of the pattern are indeed such as the V&amp;A suggests, the result is one more example of the tendency in Islamic art to begin in nature and work toward pattern. Any curator charged with creating a new gallery to display his museum's collection will want to organize the displays around its strengths. Tim Stanley has chosen as the gallery's centerpiece the sixteenth-century Ardabil carpet from Persia. Visitors to the V&amp;A in years past will recall how awkwardly the carpet used to be displayed</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD TILLINGHAST 297 half of it flat, half of it raised to a vertical plane facing the viewer. The fifty-square-meter carpet woven of silk and wool, boasting an incredible 304 knots per square inch, now lies flat on the floor, surrounded by an invisible enclosure of non-reflective glass, with an enormous slab coated with what looks like copper, fitted out with fiber-optic lighting, sus pended from the ceiling on steel cables-all this to protect the priceless carpet from light and dust. The lights are switched on for ten minutes twice hourly. It was William Morris who in 1893 urged the V&amp;A to purchase the carpet from a London dealer, citing the Ardabil's "singular perfection" and stating that "to us pattern-designers, Persia has become a holy land." Like William Morris, I have a passion for Persian and Turkish rugs, but I question the space given over to this carpet. Realistically, car pets are made to be walked and sat on, and this one was probably de signed for a huge room in a Persian palace or grand London mansion. They are lovely to look at, but few people are going to sit and gaze at them for very long. Ingenious as the museum's solution to the technical problem of how to display the carpet, the giant suspended slab arrange ment is ungainly. Yet William Morris' comment, and his role in the museum's acqui sition of the carpet, point to the influence the art of the Islamic world has had on European decorative arts, particularly on the Arts and Crafts tradition in England. In architecture there are Orientalist fantasies like the Royal Pavilion in Brighton and the Anglo-Indian masterpieces Sir Edward Lutyens created along Raj Path in New Delhi. Looking at exquisite seventeenth-century Persian cuerda-seca tile panels from the Safavid dynasty depicting aristocrats picnicking, with silk-gowned figures of young pages and serving girls, their figures sensuously curv ing, their facial expressions mysterious, one cannot help but speculate about the influence of these ideas on Art Nouveau and even the Pre Raphaelites. No wonder the rich Levantine merchants who fattened on trade within the Ottoman Empire took so readily to the Art Nouveau style when they came to build their sumptuous private mansions and apartment buildings along the Grande Rue de Pera in Constantinople. Like the architectural consonances I mentioned in relation to how the design of the jameel Gallery fits into the overall scheme of the V&amp;A, these resemblances point to further continuities between Islamic and European art. The Ottoman sultans' collection of Chinese ceramics, one of the most comprehensive anywhere, and the designs, colors and glazes of that work provided an inspiration, both technically and aesthetically, for Iznik pottery in all its glory. The same may be said for ceramics of the Safavid dynasty in Persia: In the tile panels I mentioned in the previous paragraph, those elegant picnickers are eating their sweetmeats off blue-and-white Yuan and early Ming dynasty plates and pouring their wine from pitchers of similar design, rendered in unmis takable detail. After looking at these scenes, one may listen on headsets to recordings of Persian poetry by Hafez and Firdausi in praise of wine,</page><page sequence="6">298 THE HUDSON REVIEW drinking parties beside melodiously flowing streams, love, the pleasures of the chase, and get a sense of the literature often used as subject matter for the pictorial arts. It is perhaps harder to draw a line between sacred and secular in the Islamic world than in the Judeo-Christian one. But, especially when delighting in art from the Ottoman and Safavid courts, including the poetry mentioned above and the ceramics inspired by it, I found myself wishing there were some word other than "Islamic" to cover the art in the jameel Gallery. I can't think of a single word that would serve better, but the appellation can all the same be misleading if it suggests that all this art is of a religious nature. Secular Mamluk domestic work of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, with its bold ceramic jars, brass basins, trays and lamp-stands, glorifies the quotidian with no ostensibly religious context. The only "Islamic" element in Mamluk brasswork, Safavid ceramic depictions of idealized aristocratic picnics, Mughal and Persian miniature paintings, or sumptuous Ottoman silks and eye delighting Iznik tiles, may be the idea that God manifests Himself fully in His creation, which is for that reason fully worthy of the artist's full attention and effort.
