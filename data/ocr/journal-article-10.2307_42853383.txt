<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL NOTE 'FIGURATIONAL SOCIOLOGY': SOME CRITICAL COMMENTS ON ZYGMUNT BAUMAN'S, 'THE PHENOMENON OF NORBERT ELIAS' Eric Dunning and Stephen Mennell Zygmunt Bauman's review essay ( Sociology , 13 (1), January 1979, pp. 117-25) is a noteworthy and in many ways accurate attempt to assess the general relevance of Norbert Elias's work for contemporary sociology. In his judgment of The Civilizing Process as a chef d oeuvre and recognition that, in attempting to unravel the intrinsic dynamics of social figurations, Elias has sought to develop an 'explanatory device better geared to the needs of sociology than naturalistic, causal explanations', Bauman reveals an exceptional breadth of vision and degree of detachment from entrenched positions. He also recognizes that Elias has struggled with some success to transcend the static, reifying and value-laden 'individual- society', 'order-anomie' and 'stability-change' dichotomizations. Nevertheless, his ex- position of Elias seems to us defective in some respects and we should like to comment on a few points. Bauman is right to draw attention to the sociological puzzle of Elias's lack of impact in Britain, where he taught for half his life. The fact that his most important books are only now appearing in English has certainly contributed, but there are other influences on a variety of levels. One is demonstrated in Bauman's essay: the compulsion to locate within 'the history of ideas' works which do not fit traditional moulds and which challenge customary ways of thinking. In part, that is an understandable, even necessary practice and, as Bauman notes, especially in the early stages of his career Elias failed to place his work within the sociological map with the consequence that this task has fallen to others. Bauman has begun to perform it, and rightly places Freud, Simmel, Comte, Marx, Tönnies and Spencer on the list of those who have directly or indirectly influenced Elias or with whom he has affinities. But there is at least one notable omission: Durkheim and his concept of 'interdependence'. This is a harmonistic category in Durkheim's usage but it is transformed by Elias into a more 'object-adequate' sociological tool. Thus, Elias's concept of interdependence does not involve a conceptual separation and reification of the interrelated conflictual and consensual aspects of social figurations. Moreover, it focusses on the way in which different power-balances are structurally generated within specific 'chains of interdependence ' . This points to a danger inherent in the history of ideas approach: that of failing to see the way in which borrowed ideas - whether or not the borrower is aware of the act of borrowing - are selectively incorporated and, as it were, 'dialectically' transformed and transcended in a genuine synthesis. And that, in our view, is what Elias has achieved. Such syntheses have to be evaluated and tested as such . Locating works in the history of ideas is valuable up to a point but its value immediately ceases if it is allowed to degenerate into an end in itself, becoming a reductionist technique for dissolving away all originality.</page><page sequence="2">498 CRITICAL NOTE Such reductionism is not entirely lacking in what Bauman wrote. Thus we are told that, 'in a crude approximation . . . Elias's sociology is Simmel's "formal sociology" turned historical'. It is implied, furthermore, that Elias's historical emphasis derives largely from Rickert and that, in contrast with the 'reductionist and generalizing' sociology of Simmel, 'Elias's sociology is totalizing and individualizing'. It would be absurd to claim that any sociologist trained in Germany in the 1920's and 1930's could have been uninfluenced by Rickert or any of the other participants in the famous Methodenstreit that occurred around the turn of the century. But to assert that Elias's approach is, in part, 'individualizing' (or, more properly 'particularizing') is to assimilate his synthesis far too closely to the ideas of Rickert. It is, for example, far less 'individualizing' than the synthesis produced by Weber. More significantly, Bauman 's assertion is based on a failure to appreciate the way in which Elias seeks to transcend the traditional dichotomization of 'the general' and 'the particular'. His sociology is, in a sense, both 'totalizing' and 'individualizing' yet simultaneously neither in that it strives to transcend present ideas of what 'totalization' and 'individualization' or 'particularization' entail. This difficult issue can, perhaps, be partly and provisionally explained as follows. The Civilizing Process is not, as Bauman implies, simply a study of a unique social process. Nor is Elias's theory testable solely by reference to the Western European figurational context within which the process occurred. Rather, it is potentially testable by reference to the comparable processes in other figurational contexts, for example, the 'civilizing processes' that occurred, and are occurring, in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, India, China, Japan and in the 'new' world as well as in the 'old' one. Each of these processes was - and is - certainly unique in some respects, but to recognize that is not to deny that they also possess properties in common or that Elias's theory provides a useful and important clue to establishing what these common properties are. Bauman doubts 'whether Elias intended the Prozess as a manifesto of an alternative sociology'. If he reads the second part of the (as yet untranslated) second volume,1 however, he will find evidence to the contrary. The plea for a processual approach to sociology does not date simply from the 1969 Preface to the second edition. The question of chronology itself is unimportant but the processual approach is central to Elias's view of sociology and helps to explain further the difficulty with which his ideas have been received. He contends that if one thinks consistently in terms of processes, not only are misleading distinctions such as 'individual' and 'society' dissolved, but many of the present conceptions of science become unusable and have to be revised - including the very notion of 'method'. Other sociologists have inveighed against what Elias calls Zustandsreduktion - conceptual reduction of processes to static categories - but few have taken so seriously the task of overcoming it. For example, Habermas, who is aware as Elias of the Zustandsreduktion problem, has nevertheless in recent years taken refuge in the pursuit of a 'universal pragmatics', seeking like others before him the constants (or 'generative rules' in current idiom) underlying social processes. Elias is more radical, questioning both the existence and the value of any such 'first principles', at whatever level of abstraction. Sociology's present 'methodological self-consciousness', of which Bauman speaks with satisfaction, is at best a mixed blessing. Elias contends that it is dangerous for wheels to grind without corn. Even sociological method has to be seen in the context of the study of processes of social development. His views on method, as on everything else, are developed within what E. P. Thompson calls 'an empirical idiom of discourse', which is something very different from mere 'empiricism'.2 Confusion between these two may be what leads Bauman apparently to overlook Elias's very sophisticated view of the relationship between 'subjects' and 'objects', and between the 'theoretical' and the 'empirical' in science. The latter point is worthy of elaboration. Bauman writes:</page><page sequence="3">CRITICAL NOTE 499 By reducing methodological decisions to the right or wrong reflections of the 'subject matter in hand', Elias encourages his followers to close their eyes to the active, creative role of the individual or collective subject of knowledge. Various mental constructs of social reality are thereby neatly split into one true and objective knowledge and a series of ideologically induced deviations - exactly the kind of confusion between the 'is' and the 'ought' which Elias, rightly, holds against Parsons' idea of 'order'. The one reductionism Elias approves of (this of the sciences to their respective objects) deprives specifically methodological concerns of much of their urgency and may well result in the return to this methodological smugness which was one of the less attractive qualities of many a sociological giant of the last century: let us only surrender to the intrinsic logic of the object out there, and the truth and objectivity of our knowledge will take care of themselves. The great philosophical theme of the twentieth century - that objects 'out there' are not describable, visible, or indeed thinkable without unceasing constructing efforts of the knowing subjects - cannot be discarded or forgotten without losing much of the subtlety our activity has acquired of late.3 This is based on a curious misreading for, without pretending to do much more than offer suggestions regarding the way in which the sociology of knowledge could fruitfully reorient itself and steer between the Scylla of apriorism and the chary bdis of relativism, Elias collapses the static and reifying distinctions between individual and collectivity, subject and object, method and subject - matter, empirical and theoretical, truth and falsehood on which this aspect of Bauman's critique depends. That is, according to Elias, knowledge is not a question of an unchanging individual subject using eternally and universally valid methods to develop 'true' conceptual representations of an unchanging and undifferentiated external world. On the contrary, it is obtained by means of a social process that occurs within specific figurations and in the course of which subjects who are in and part of the world obtain, under specific circumstances, conceptual representations of themselves and the world they are in and part of - representations that are more 'object-adequate' than those that preceded them. And knowledge is always obtained, according to Elias, partly by means of a socially generated process of 'self-distanciation'. The shift from a 'geocentric' to a 'heliocentric' cosmology is a case in point for it occurred, Elias argues, as part of a wider shift from an anthropocentric view of 'nature' to one in which men began to see themselves more and more as inhabiting a world subject to 'impersonal laws'. And one of the measures of such a process of self-distanciation is the degree to which anthropomorphic references to the logic of objects is avoided in favour of terms that represent more adequately the immanent properties of the physical and social worlds.4 There is yet another traditional conceptual dichotomization that Elias has struggled to collapse and transcend, that between 'accident' or 'freedom' on the one hand, and 'determinism' on the other. That is, he rejects the polarization and reification of these categories as mutually exclusive states, arguing, for example, that the degree of determination and, therefore, predictability of particular social processes is a figurationally and developmentally specific, and therefore variable, social fact. That, for example, is a central implication of his 'games models', yet Bauman baldly asserts that, according to Elias, all social processes are equally open-ended 'in the sense that no future set of events is fully determined by the prior network of inter-dependencies'. He evidently missed the passage in What is Sociology? where Elias writes: The degree of pliability and plasticity (or conversely the degree of rigidity) varies widely from one figuration to another. Thus, the range of possibilities for change varies, too. One figuration may have much greater potential for change than another. Again, different figurations may have potential for different kinds of change. Then a figuration</page><page sequence="4">500 CRITICAL NOTE may have great potential for change without any of the possible changes being developmental in character - none of them involves structural change - change, that is, in the power potential of certain social positions rather than mere changes of personnel among the occupants of these positions. Or a figuration may have little potential for change, yet the chances may be very high that any changes which do occur will be developmental. In many if not all cases, the figurations formed by the interdependent people are so plastic that the figuration at any later stage of the figurational flow is in fact only one of the many possible transformations of an earlier figuration. But as a particular figuration changes into another, a very wide scatter of possible transformations narrows down to a single outcome. In retrospect it is just as feasible to examine the range of potential outcomes as it is to discover the particular constellation of factors responsible for the emergence of this one figuration rather than any other of the possible alternatives. This explains why a retrospective developmental investigation can often demonstrate with a high degree of certainty that a figuration had to arise out of a certain earlier figuration or even out of a particular type of sequential series of figurations, but does not assert that the earlier figurations had necessarily to change into the later ones.5 Perhaps the fact that, in his own work, Bauman stresses 'historical contingency' rather than the structured character of social processes helps to explain why he has misread Elias on this point.6 That is, unable to gain sufficient autonomy from his own preconceptions, he has projected them on to Elias. As a result, he is unable to grasp the subtle manner in which the latter has begun to develop a conceptualization that is more adequate than conventional modes as a means of representing the peculiar, structurally and developmentally variable balance, specific to human figurations, between 'determinism' and 'freedom'. Again, we can think of no better way of illustrating Bauman 's misreading of Elias on this point than to quote Elias 's own words. He writes: Historically, 'determinism' has usually denoted a mechanical determinacy of the kind observed in causally conditioned physical sequences. In contrast, when the indeterminacy, the 'freedom', of the individual is stressed, it is usually forgotten that there are always simultaneously many mutually dependent individuals, whose interdependence to a greater ot lesser extent limits each one's scope for action. In turn, these limitations are an essential part of their humanity. More subtle tools of thought than the usual antithesis of 'determinism' and 'freedom' are needed if such problems are to be solved.7 It is our contention that Elias has done more than most other sociologists to show the way in which these 'more subtle tools of thought' can be developed. But Bauman is unable to free himself sufficiently from traditional categories and his own preconceptions to perceive the subtlety of what Elias has written on this score. There remains Bauman 's allegation that Elias 's vision of sociology is of 'an essentially retrospective wisdom'. However, if as Bauman seems ready to acknowledge, the figurational approach has 'remarkable potential' for helping us to understand the social processes in which human beings are caught up, it is unlikely to be devoid of practical import. Elias speaks of sociology as 'a destroyer of myths' (the title of a whole chapter in What is Sociology ?), and of its role in 'improving the means of orientation' by which people make their way through the opaque figurations in which they are interwoven. In short, whilst stressing the primacy of the need for knowledge as such, his sociology is democratic, humanistic and liberating in its aims and not concerned solely with developing an administrative or political technology for ruling or revolutionary élites. Are these so modest as practical aims? It may yet prove that the figurational approach has greater effect on society</page><page sequence="5">CRITICAL NOTE 501 in the long term than other views whose advocates think less of the validity (or, more properly, 'object-adequacy') of their theories and more of the impact they will have. Perhaps we should wait a little and reserve judgment on this score. That is as it should be: Elias 's approach is by its nature a sociology de longue haleine. More perhaps than most theorists he would wish his work to be judged by its fruitfulness in stimulating that of others. Notes I.
