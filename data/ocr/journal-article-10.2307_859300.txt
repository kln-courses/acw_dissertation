(i) A study of details respecting antique mar- bles, gleaned from the sketch-books of Marten van Heemskerck, who was in Rome from 1532-36. By their help Dr. Huebner reconstructs the original collection in the Villa Madama formed by Clement VII, which included the so-called " Farnese " Diadumenos now in the British Museum. An interesting identification is that of the Louvre Term (7?upiter of Versailles) with the upper part of a full-length figure dug up between 1532-34 on the Monte Mario. In both cases the sketch-book supplies missing links in the history of the statues, but, conversely, a torso in the Ny- Carlsberg Museum, identified as a figure of the Pedagogue from the Niobid series, supplies Dr. Huebner with evidence that Michaelis placed van Heemskerck's date about twenty years too late. It has always been assumed that Renaissance sketches of such a torso could not be earlier in date than 1583, when the well known replica in Florence was found; Dr. Huebner, however, gives good reason for his contenteion that the Ny- Carlsberg torso is the original of these sketches. Three occur in note-books generally accepted as van Heemskerck's work, and assigned on other grounds to the years between 1550-1572; the identification therefore solves a recognized diffi- culty as to the duration of the artist's activity and incidentally proves that the Ny-Carlsberg torso was known in the middle of the I6th century.- (2) Dr. Yetts's short but valuable paper which was read before the China Society in January, 1912, is now printed as a brochure. It comprises twenty- eight pages of text with copious illustrations, and treats an interesting subject in a thorough and scholarly fashion. Dr. Yetts's acquaintance with the Chinese language has enabled him to consult original sources of information, and to give the correct Chinese terminology, quoting the characters where necessary. Students of Chinese art will welcome this contribution to their knowledge of an important aspect of the subject, and will hope that it is only the earnest of a further and more exhaustive work which Dr. Yetts is so well equipped to undertake.-(3) Dr. Paul Jacobsthal, who piously presents his attractive brochure to his father on his sixtieth birthday, makes an exhaustive enquiry into the influence of the Herakleian myth on the Thesean, as shown by the treatment of Theseus's visit to his parents, in 4th century Greek art, and especially in vase- paintings, and he compares it with the treatment of similar scenes in the myths of other heroes.- (4) Though Prof. Massa does not write in a manner very convincing logically, he is evidently AA 303</page><page sequence="2">Reviews and Notices right in the main trend of his interpretation, particularly as regards the conclusions of learned antiquaries possessing only a pedantic knowledge of Christian mythology. It is a pity that the illustrations of this enthusiastic and interesting study are not better printed, for every photograph of the tomb of Galla Placidia has become valuable since the Italian restorers laid their hands upon it.--(5) All that Mr. Weale writes upon his special subject deserves preservation. He here reviews the reception of his great book on the Van Eycks, regretting that The Burlington Magazine and one other periodical alone treated it seriously. The fact is that his wise caution disappointed seekers for novel theories. Mr. Weale's object was not to add to the mass of speculations, but to chronicle facts ascertained beyond the possibility of subsequent correction-not an exciting, but an invaluable work.-(6) The authors describe an in- teresting family album of drawings, in 2 volumes, which they are patiently investigating, and from which they now publish six drawings by an italian- isant whom they can give good reasons for identify- ing with Frans I loris. The result of further inves- tigations by these careful students will be welcome. -(7) In order to do the Abb6 Loisel full justice we recommend that his study should be read through- out, for we deal here rather with what he suggests than with what he actually says. He maintains that Moreau's " Cahiers ", now being gradually made accessible, prove Christian inspiration in unexpected places, which has been ignored by critics who did not much wish to see it. We accept this on the authority of the Abb6 who does wish to see it. Moreau was certainly well-read in Christian literature-from which he drew a large number of his subjects, but we do not see in his treatment of them, as the Abb6 seems to see, any strong evidence of the derivation of his treatment from Christian art, though it may not be incompatible with Christian sentiment. Moreau's treatment seems derived from nothing more distinctively Christian than Ingres. On the other hand the treatment of the decorations of the Catacombs was directly derived from Pagan art. Would the Abb6 consider those decorations less Christian than Moreau's ? At any rate, Moreau's Christian art is less Pagan in treatment than the anthropomorphism of Christian rococo.-- (8) Since the city of Brussels has just razed to the ground the house of Teniers, David II of his family, this pamphlet by the president of the Soci6t6 royale d'Architecture preserves the records of its former existence and also of the existence of two fine I5th-century mansions, the h6tels Raven- stein. M. Des Marez succeeded in saving some fragments of carved stone and parts of the interior woodwork of Teniers's house, which are now in the town museum. He shows that Teniers actually lived S.E. of the rue Terarken opposite the house popularly called the "Maison de Teniers", which had nothing to do with him. However, the Brussels municipality razed both. M. Des Marez alludes euphemistically to the destruction of ancient buildings " in accordance with inexorable laws "; we wonder whether whether he considers the substi- tution of bad building for good also inevitable.- (9) It is curious that an unpublished MS. by Reynolds should first appear out of the Fitz- william Museum in a French translation, but it probably loses little or nothing in M. Dimier's version and will certainly gain by his introductory remarks. Though, as he points out, Reynolds's subject was by no means unworn, Reynolds treats it as suggestively as we should expect of one of the ablest intellects among modern painters. One sentence catches the eye : " Le labour et les talents des hommes sont le bien le plus precieux de 'Etat ". It is characteristic of an artist so emi- nently social as Reynolds to be able to consider his art in any relation to the state whatever.- (Io) M. P. Haverkorn van Rijsewijk contributes an interesting and very well illustrated note to the biography of Matthew Maris, concerning his and Jacob Maris's visits to Wolfhezen and Lausanne in 1859, 186o and 1862, owing to the liberality of their patroness the Princess Marianne of Orange- Nassau. Evidently an enthusiastic admirer of the Maris brothers, the author eagerly chronicles their impressions by the directest means available, their sketches. So conscious was Matthew Maris of the literary value of his art, that, as M. Haverkorn van Rijsewijk reminds us, he was constantly seeking to extend it by improving the titles of his works.- (I ) Mr. Noel Heaton's three lectures, on the development of decorative painting; on fresco and its modifications; and on tempera and oil, should be of great service not only to practical decorators, but to all who are interested in the history of decoration. He is an explorer of primitive sites and a student of the arts as well as a thoroughly trained chemist, and he has the faculty of making the chemical technicalities of his subject perfectly intelligible to laymen.- (12) Mr. B. D. Taylor's general remarks, with most of which we cordially agree, raise too large a question to discuss here. A central site and topical interest are essentials for a provincial museum. Manchester, in particular, should direct its energies first to displaying the Brock Collection of Textiles. A municipality might possibly, per- haps, facilitate artistic development in a local industry. It can neither foster nor suppress a pure artist capable of producing work worth pur- chasing with public monies. To attempt to do so by art education would be "bad business", and we sympathize with the inartistic aldermen who object. They are the best allies of a Director with taste and judgment, such as Mr. Taylor's, who protests against the purchase of "exhibition 304</page><page sequence="3">Reviews and Notices pictures" at inflated prices. If the people of Manchester ever like the arts they will have a municipality capable of providing objects such as Mr. Taylor would approve; until they do, the collection of such objects had far better be left to individuals and societies independent of the municipality. A municipality enlightened on its own ignorance can do much at little or no cost to encourage such independent efforts.-- (13) Mr. Tudor's thoughtful little pamphlets deserve well of those inhabitants of Derby who are interested in the arts. These are not, we fear, numerous, but are evidently enterprising and have good friends, for they organized during the past year an exhibition remarkable for a large collection of Italian drawings lent by the Duke of Devonshire, arid another containing a small collection of pictures lent by Capt. Drury-Lowe, sufficiently important to have been catalogued by Dr. Richter. Mr. Tudor is their Ruskin .-(I4) This is a plea for a new national industrial policy. Since the subject is scarcely within our compass we have not given enough attention to Mr. Sanderson's pamphlet to be able to endorse his opinions, but only to say that he seems a thoughtful and sincere publicist, who has formed personal convictions without any factional parti pris ; so that we have pleasure in referring our readers to the address, Eastfield Hall, Warkworth, Northumberland, at which Mr. Sanderson asks those who sympathize with his objective to communicate with him.-(I1) (16) The pamphlets of our contributors, Dr. Schmidt- Degener and Dr. Schubring have already been noticed (15) in Vol. xxII, p. 62, and (16) in Vol. xxI, p. 307. Dr. Schubring's second pamphlet (17) will be noticed in our next precis of German periodicals under the periodical in which it first appeared. (18) Mr. Louis Maeterlinck's article on two Roger van der Weydens is reserved for longer reference than is here possible. THE MEDICI SOCIETY draws our attention to the fact that in the review of the new edition of Vasari's Lives"' some of the illustrations were described as being in half-tone instead of in collotype. We should regret very much if the mistake led any of our readers to suppose that these admirably produced volumes are less finely illustrated than is the case. THE Madonna of the Oak Tree, now on view at the Hotel Cecil, has been vigorously advertised in the daily press. The usual and indispensable touch of romance has been given by the statement that it was smuggled out of Italy to avoid the Pacca law. Doubtless the Italian authorities have let some important masterpieces pass unnoticed over the border, but in this instance they are to be congratulated on having allowed Italy to lose one more of the innumerable copies of the later works of Raphael. The present picture is evidently a copy of the same composition now in the Prado at Madrid. This is, indeed, not one of Raphael's capital works, being made up out of the Madonna della Pala and the Madonna of Francis I, and is supposed by almost all authorities to be merely an atelier piece done at that period of Raphael's career when he had given up the endeavour to execute his numerous commissions with his own hand. But poor as the Madrid picture is, its superiority to the work so loudly proclaimed in London is indisputable. MR. ROBERT WITT, while continuing to welcome all who wish to consult the Collection of Photo- graphs and Reproductions of Pictures of all Schools at 27, Connaught Square, Hyde Park, will be much obliged if visitors will give him notice of their intention, so that the secretary may be available to assist them.
