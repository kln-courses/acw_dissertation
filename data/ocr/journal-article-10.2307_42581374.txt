<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK AND THE ENGLISH TASTE FOR GENRE by t Robert Raines He became very eminent for Painting drolls after the manner of Brawer. His gross and comical genius succeeded for a long while among us. . . . His drunken drolls, his wakes, his quakers- meetings, and some lewd pieces, have been in vogue among the waggish collectors, and the lower rank of virtuosi. He went in this kind a great way, but after all fell far short of Brawer, Teniers, and the rest of his noble fore-runners, in the study of sots paradice. Buckeridge's quoted published in this in succinct article 1706, 1 which of account which is chiefly the of Egbert above concerned is van an with Heemskerck extract, Heemskerck will (c. be 1635-1704), the frequently painter Buckeridge's published in 1706, 1 of which the above is an extract, will be frequently quoted in this article which is chiefly concerned with Heemskerck the painter and purveyor of Dutch genre and drolleries to the English market, and the continuing popularity of these works in the early years of the eighteenth century. BIOGRAPHY In an article in 1925, Dr Bredius2 identified the painter as Egbert Jasperz. van Heemskerck, and commented that the little known about his life before he left Holland is confusing. The facts, as reported by Bredius, largely from a study of notaries' records, may be briefly summarized. Born about 1635 in Haarlem he was still there, or had returned, in 1655 when he was planning to go to Italy. He is not recorded in Holland again until 1661/2, nor is there any contemporary mention ofhim in Italy. Had he reached Rome he would have surely have joined the Schildersbent, by then a somewhat discredited and disreputable group of Netherlandish painters working in the city, but his name is not in the Society's records.3 In 1661/2 he was living in Amsterdam and then flitted between that city, The Hague and Haarlem until 1669, after which he disappears until the mid-seventies when he turns up in London. Vertue notes 'At Sr John Evelyns, at Wooton ... of Egbert Hemskirk a boors conversation 1674. in his Juvenal manner',4 perhaps painted here or perhaps an imported work. Vertue has little to say about Heemskerck except that he lived 'sometime' at Oxford where he 'painted many peices some in poses Mr Crynes'.5 This stay would presumably be during the later eighties when he painted The Oxford Election (Fig. 175). He had probably married one Hester Bastiaens about 1669. 6 119</page><page sequence="2">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK Virtually nothing is known of Heemskerck's personal life in England and little of his relations with his fellow painters. His portrait of John Riley, engraved by Bannerman, has, where a signature might be expected, a small self-portrait, implying some familiarity with the sitter (Fig. 165). Charles D'Agar had a self-portrait of Heemskerck smoking, perhaps the 'Heemskirk smoaking, painted by him Seife. 1687'7 in Adrian Beverland's collection in 1702, and Zincke a probable self-portrait and a portrait of Mrs Heemskerck,8 but they are unlikely to have been the first owners as neither is known to have been in England by 1704. There are, however, several pointers to a friendship with Marcellus Lauron - 'Old Laroon'. They collaborated in some way in a Quaker Meeting, the print of which is lettered Lauron Heemskirk pinx (Appendix A, no. 4. Fig. 167). 9 Lauron painted a Presbyterian Meeting for Pierce Tempest (Appendix A. no. 12, Fig. 166) whose portrait by Heemskerck is known only from a mezzotint. It was much in the same vein as the Quakers and was perhaps reissued as a Quaker Meeting by Heemskerck. 'Old Heemskerck's head by Old Laroon' was noted by Dr Cox Macro in his notebook of purchases. The two painters must have been slightly disreputable birds of a feather. Buckeridge remarks of Heemskerck that 'in most of his conversations, as he called them, you may see the picture, and read the manners of the man at the same time'; nor is his comment that 'he was a man of humour, and for that valued by the late Earl of Rochester' much of a character recommendation. Of Lauron Vertue comments that 'his thoughts in his pictures shew him to be a Man of levity, of loose conversation &amp; morals suteable to his birth &amp; education being low &amp; spurious'. 10 According to Buckeridge Heemskerck had been a pupil of 'de Grebber'. This would be Pieter de Grebber (1600-1652/3), a Haarlem classicist and follower of Rubens and Jordaens and later of Rembrandt. Neither in subject nor in style does Heemskerck's work remotely resemble de Grebber's, but his effective, though sometime excessive chiaroscuro may have been a legacy of this pupilage. His paintings surely indicate some time spent in the studio of a genre painter. Rosenberg and Slive11 draw attention to the similarity of some of Heemskerck's paintings to those ofjan Miensz. Molenaer ( c . 1609/ 10-1668): around 1640 his [Molenaer's] paintings underwent a change and became dull and monotonous. He fell under Ostade's influence, but fails to capture any of his model's psychological insight or power of design in his paintings of crowds of peasants in large interiors . . . His pictures of this period are sometimes confused with those by his follower Egbert van Heemskerck. Molenaer, a Haarlemer by birth, had moved to Amsterdam about 1637 but returned some ten years later to live at Heemstede only four kilometres from Haarlem. Heemskerck was then at an age when an aspiring young painter would be seeking a master. It is tempting to conjecture that perhaps after a short time with de Grebber, 120</page><page sequence="3">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK who died when Heemskerck was at most seventeen, he had joined Molenaer's studio. Whatever his training he modelled his work on the Dutch and Flemish painters of low life: Molenaer, Brouwer, Teniers, and Adriaen Ostade. He had little of their inventive vivacity, perception of character or sense of colour, but occasionally approached somewhere near their lesser works. He was a good draughtsman and a competent but inconsistent and often derivative painter. His colour is seldom lively but he could add felicitous touches to otherwise sad-coloured canvasses. Buckeridge's comment that as to his painting 'there is little fault to be found with it, unless sometimes with the foulness of the colouring' is faint praise but on the whole well-justified. If he did visit Italy there is nothing in his work to suggest that he had studied or even looked at Italian paintings. He continued to paint Dutch subjects in a Dutch manner for many years after he came to England and to satisfy the curious demand for drolleries; and yet, with originality sometimes breaking through, he produced some interesting and quite vivid pictures during the first twenty years or so in this country. Egbert van Heemskerck died in 1704, leaving one son, of identical name.12 Nowadays remembered solely for his drawings of anthropomorphic animals, and that largely because of a supposed influence on Hogarth, Egbert Heemskerck the younger (Heemskerck II) is an even more elusive figure than his father. Eighteenth century sale catalogues seldom make a distinction between 'old' and 'young' Heemskerck, but one of the few paintings specified is 'A Dutch Family saying Grace by Young Hemskirk' in the Charles Joye sale of 1722. To add to the confusion the elder Heemskerck may have painted animal-headed figures; 'A night peice with monkies cloathed' was one of the paintings sold by Thomas Povey to William Blathwayt in 1693: possibly by the son, as may have been 'two monkies as Capuchin friars very good' noted by Horace Walpole in 1780 in the collection of Thomas Barrett. 13 It seems likely that Heemskerck II worked with his father and that some of the less accomplished drolleries were the products of the family studio, and that after 1704 he continued to suppy the still ready market with poor quality genre scenes, sometimes signed with the monogram o(EHK used by his father. J. T. Smith writing of painters whose works have been confused with Hogarth's refers to 'that drunken pot-house Painter, the younger Hemskirk, who was a singer at Sadler's Wells'.14 There is no record of a 'Hemskirk' at Sadler's Wells but 'Hemskirk' was employed as actor, dancer, and singer at the theatres in Goodman's Fields from 1740 to 1742 and Lincoln's Inn Fields until 1743 when the Company was disbanded. 15 Presumably this was Heemskerck II, who, one supposes, was a late addition to the family since, had he been born before his father came to England, he would have been nearly, if not quite, seventy by 1743: a late age to be singing in Purcell's music for King Arthur and to be playing such roles as Lockit in The Beggars' Opera. He is said to have died in 1744. 121</page><page sequence="4">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK QUAKER AND OTHER 'RELIGIOUS' SUBJECTS The Quaker Meetings, paintings and engravings, provide a complex incident in Anglo-Dutch artistic exchange - the close association which Heemskerck preserved with his native land cannot be doubted - and a confused and sometimes acid comment on seventeenth-century religious toleration. Their interpretation has caused disagreement. W. I. Hull, in an important but somewhat uncritical article, sees them as factual representations of meetings in Holland with portraits of visiting English Friends.16 He agrees with W. Whitten that one (Appendix A, no. 5a, Fig. 172) is 'the great historic picture of primitive Quakerism', although Hull certainly and Whitten apparently knew it only from a later print. 17 In an addendum to Hull's article J. L. Nickalls asks whether they depict Quaker meetings at all, and if so how far they convey the material circumstances and appearances of a Friends' meeting. He concludes, 'The pictures must therefore surely be done like some of the plays and literature of the time, by and for those who simply thought Quakers were a good subject for jest - religious enthusiasts.' F. Saxl however takes a fairly lofty view, more in agreement with Hull than with Nickalls, commenting that 'Although a small artist, Heemskerck had enough understanding of Rembrandt's art to aspire to similar problems. He turned away from the Bible subjects and studied spiritual life in the Meeting places of the Friends where a new religion was born.'18 These contrasting views may have arisen from the failure to distinguish between works by Heemskerck himself and those by his followers and imitators, and to consider those by Heemskerck as a group rather than individually. Only five paintings can with certainty be given to Heemskerck: one at Saltram House dated 1678, one at Welshpool of possibly 1690, and two closely related Meetings, in the Ashmolean Museum and the Royal Collection, both undated. The fifth (Appendix A, no. 4, Fig. 167), of which the engraving is lettered Heemskerk Lauron pinx, appears to be wholly the work of Heemskerck. Competently, indeed vigorously painted, the Welshpool Meeting (Appendix A, no. 2, Figs. 168 and 169) appears to be a factual'and not unsympathetic representation of a Friends' meeting without overt satirical intent, but with no indication whatever that the painter has 'seen the Light'. A painting sympathetic to Quakers could have been made, or at least displayed, in England only after the Declaration of Indulgence of 1672 and before the renewed attack on Dissenters three years later, after 1680 when James II, with questionable motive, was attempting to introduce some measure of toleration, or after the Revolution of 1688. Even during those years satirical paintings and writing would have been thoroughly acceptable, but satire in another age may be seen where it was not intended. Quakers were not, in the seventeenth century, the successful, respectable, and respected middle-class community of later times. As 122</page><page sequence="5">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK W. C. Braithwaite points out they were 'originally drawn principally from the trading and yeoman classes though there were some artisans and labourers, a fair number of merchants and a few gentry'. 19 An adverse tract of 1700 remarks that 'they always have an eye to the men of bad character who are persuaded that the best way to clear their credit is to close with such as pretend to so much godliness'. A very mixed assembly is then to be expected and this Heemskerck provides. One of the unusual and curious features of almost all these Meetings, originals and imitations, is that the speaker is a woman for although 'the equality of men and women in spiritual privilege and responsibility has always been one of the glories of Quakerism', women were not encouraged to be too loquacious. Of one prominent woman Friend it was said that she 'had wisdom to know the time and season of her service in which she was a good example to her sex; . . . and she was grieved when any, especially of her sex, should be too hasty, forward or unseasonable in their appearances in such meetings', or in 1701 'it's therefore advised that women Friends should be tenderly cautioned against taking up too much time in our mixed public meetings'. The speaker in the Ashmolean painting (Appendix A, no. 3, Fig. 170) appears to be one of those 'too hasty, forward or unseasonable', slightly satirized but there is no hint of caricature in her or in the other figures. The Saltram picture (Appendix A, no. 1, Fig. 171), dated 1678, is certainly intended to be satirical. One man and two women are testifying. Several figures are near to caricature. It calls to mind Celia Fiennes's comment from Scarborough in 1697: 'I was at a Quakers Meeting in the town where 4 men and 2 women spoke . . . but it seem'd such a confusion and so incoherent that it very much moved my compassion and pitty to see their delusion and ignorance';20 but whatever moved Heemskerck it was not compassion and pity. As if to emphasize its levity a grinning self-portrait holding his palette is placed well to the front, looking out of the picture as if to share the jest with the viewer. Buckeridge notes that 'he often introduced his own picture among his drolls by means of a looking glass he had upon his Pallet'. The picture which Whitten and Hull regard as 'the historic picture of early Quakerism' is known only from a mezzotint published in England some twenty years after Heemskerck's death (Appendix A, nos. 5a~5d, Fig. 172) and from a copy almost certainly of the print and not of the original painting. 21 Hull correctly points out that both the houses seen through the windows are more Dutch than English22 and suggests that the meeting is taking place in either Haarlem or Rotterdam, in August 1677, with Gertrud Deriks, a prominent Dutch Quaker, speaking, and a number of English Friends who are known to have attended that year's meeting. He names as possible subjects among others, Fox, Penn, and Barclay. There is little doubt that the two men on the extreme right are portraits but they have not been satisfactorily 123</page><page sequence="6">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK identified. Hull also notes that the lettering, with the exception of the signature, appears to have been scraped away and re-lettered for the publisher John Bowles. He then suggests that Heemskerck must thave painted this meeting before he left Holland, but the costume of the two men on the right, of about 1685-90 seems to preclude the Dutch origin, unless of course Heemskerck made a return visit. Such a visit would make a great deal of sense in view of his continuing association with Dutch engravers and the continuing style of his work and choice of Dutch subjects. The raison d'être of the Quaker Meetings, no less than their origin, is obscure. Saxl sees them as continuing a tradition, going so far as to suggest a link with Rembrandt's etching, the so-called Little Tomb. While Heemskerck could hardly help being aware of the tradition of serious paintings of religious groups, and perhaps of Rembrandt's etchings, he would also be aware of the vast output of satires and caricatures, both graphic and written, of English dissenting sects. While any of these may have triggered off the idea, the paintings by Heemskerck himself appear to be more the outcome of observation than of imitation. The generalized buildings in which the Friends meet, while not unlike Heemskerck's tavern interiors, are probably fairly representative of their places of worship, and the individual characterization of his people, especially in the Welshpool painting, implies close observation of Quakers in their Meetings. The reason for these Quaker paintings, none of which can be traced back to its original owner, and prints, might be partly elucidated if we had some indication if they were commissioned or if Heemskerck chanced finding a private purchaser or an interested publisher. The earliest certain owner was Sir Andrew Fountaine of Narford where Vertue saw one of these paintings in 1739. Two had appeared earlier in the sale-rooms, one in 1714 and one in 1722 at the sale of 'Charles Joye and the Directors of the South Sea Company'. They must have been quite popular with publishers and printsellers within some ten years of Heemskerck's arrival, as Pierce Tempest in a letter of 1685/6 to Francis Place refers to them familiarity as 'the Quakers': Yors I reed though the ladys have solely left painting Mezzotints yet they doe sell a little especially fancy's Heads &amp; bawdy soe I am provideing 3 or four new ones Against the Terme 2 Queens a new Confession 2 Fancys after Laroone, a Gent has Lent me a Presbyterian Meeting of the same Mar, wch Van Somer is Etching &amp; Graveing together it will be rather bigger than the Quakers . . .23 The Meetings proved of some interest and significance for several contemporary and later painters. From the number of painted imitations of varying degrees of incom- petence, (Appendix A, nos. 7-10, 12) it would seem that Heemskerck's 'vision' continued its popularity well into the eighteenth century. From this general condem- nation one serious painting of about 1725-30, without hint of satire or vulgarity, 124</page><page sequence="7">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK combining influence with originality, must be excepted (Appendix A, no. 7, Fig. 173). The figures are realistically and individually observed, save for the strange anomaly of the unwearable steeple hats, and some, notably the woman and the small boy on the left, are small masterpieces of observation. Impossible at present to find a satisfactory attribution, the painter lies somewhere within the circle of Hogarth. The most unusual association is with four early paintings by Alessandro Magnasco (i 677-1 749), 24 each with a woman speaker borrowed apparently from Heemskerk's Ashmolean painting or from Gole's engraving. In two (Geiger 187, 188) the latter dated 1697, the speaker stands on an upturned drum. The background is indeter- minate. One other figure in each painting is reminiscent of the Berlin drawing, otherwise the figures are all different. In the other two (Geiger 191, 192) the speaker is similar but all the other figures, including two nude men, are different. In one the setting appears to be a spendid mausoleum and in the other a theatre with boxes. The speaker in both stands on a monumental tomb(?) in front of a tall obelisk. Heemskerck did not limit his satirical comments to Quakers. They were also applied to aspects of Roman Catholicism. By 1729 the Earl of Derby owned a painting of a friar preaching in a cavern. The friar's gesture indicates that his sermon refers to the plentiful supply of eatables around him and its profane character is emphasized by the picture in the background of Elijah fed by a raven.25 Nine paintings of friars or monks appeared in the sale-rooms between 1722 and 1758, and several 'Confessions' all now unidentifiable. Heemskerck had by no means a monopoly in 'confessions', Lauron painting a number, some of which were engraved. There is a fairish Monks singing in the Fitzwilliam,26 and a Monks disputing 27 is no more than a tavern scene with peasants replaced by monks. OTHER GENRE SUBJECTS Heemskerck' s choice of genre subjects was somewhat limited. Other than the innumerable tavern scenes were court scenes, scenes with doctors and lawyers, school scenes, and a few other domestic subjects, including the 'grace before meat' variety. An early and outstanding work, painted before he left Holland, the Court Scene (Fig. 174)28 provides a useful comparison with The Oxford Election of 1687. A complex but well-organized composition with more than fifty figures, the Court Scene is set in a grim courtroom. The Judge, seated on a dais below the desk from which a clerk is reading the indictment, is accompanied by several official-looking figures, all individually characterized. Their expressions, the blindfolded figure of Justice, the painting of a beheading above the desk, the gallows seen through the open door, and the grinning man on the left heating a branding iron, all imply that the outcome may 125</page><page sequence="8">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK be vengeance rather than justice. The painting is bitingly satirical. Two similar but less well-characterized and less satirical versions, possibly painted in England, have been through the London sale-rooms in recent years.29 His most English picture The Oxford Election of 1687 (Fig. 175), 30 set in the Oxford Guildhall, is in striking contrast. Equally busy with even more figures, it records the turmoil surrounding the election of an alderman on 14 March 1687/8. James II had ordered the Corporation to dismiss certain aldermen and to appoint his nominees, but the Corporation refused to accept one of these. After some months of haggling they were compelled to submit. It is that meeting which is shown here.31 The painting is not explicit and unlike the Court Scene needs an explanatory text. The satire is diluted and softened and the Election becomes more comical than satirical. It has been seen to foreshadow Hogarth. Heemskerck painted a number of 'doctor' or 'deathbed' scenes. Some of these, notably the painting dated 1674 which Vertue saw in the collection of Sir John Evelyn at Wotton (Fig. 176), are black comedy with a dying man attended by a doctor wearing the costume of il dottore from the Commedia dell' arte,32 implying that he is the quack, the charlatan, the infallible mountebank. He is here following in the footsteps of Jan Steen whose doctors are seen thus attired.33 But the spirit of Steen's paintings is lighthearted, the patient, not a dying man but a pregnant young woman suffering from 'love's sickness'. Similar to the Wotton painting may have been that in William Cartwright's inventory of 1686 'A man on his deathbed, a doctor and nabors about ye bed'. Among the 'nabors' in these scenes is a lawyer, a cleric or, as in the drawing in the Louvre (Fig. 184), a monk or two.34 A less macabre treatment of this popular theme is seen in the painting of about 1690 from the collection of Sir Thomas Willoughby of Wollaton (Fig. 177). 35 It has been reasonably suggested that the conventionally, but fashionably, dressed man at the table is not a doctor but a lawyer drafting a will, a view supported perhaps by the appearance in a sale of 1691 of 'A sick man making his will'.36 The urine flask or 'matula' beside the patient, the traditional pictorial evidence of the presence of the medical profession, implies however that this is a doctor scene, whether the doctor is the man at the table or the figure in the background apparently attending to a small child. On the staircase is a man in what could be rabbinical dress. This, the Semitic appearance of the man with the money bag and the stars on the patient's cloak, may have some symbolic meaning with inevitabley satiric intent. The innumerable tavern and such like scenes must have occupied much of the painter's time. The deterioration in the standard of his work or of the studio work can best be seen by comparing paintings made soon after he came to this country with those of some twenty years later. The Tavern scene of 1675 at Knole,37 the Interior of a Farm House38 of 1677 at Wilton (Fig. 185) and the undated Tavern (Fig. 179) are tightly 126</page><page sequence="9">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK composed with sizeable figures occupying much of the canvas. Quite vigorously painted, care has been expended on the still-life which is more than competent. The painting of 1693 at Knole and the four from Wollaton of about the same date show how much less interesting the later work had become (Fig. 180). Large barn-like interiors with a score of small stereotyped figures occupy only a third of the canvas. Dull in colour and for the most part not well drawn, they are remarkable only for the fact that they were readily marketable. Five schoolroom scenes appear in London sale catalogues in the first half of the eighteenth century, and three mezzotints of this subject are known. A very Dutch example, signed and dated 1676, so certainly painted after Heemskerck had come to London, was in the sale-rooms in 193 7. 39 Other domestic genre include several 'Grace befor meat' scenes. Two early paintings on this theme, one at Haarlem (Fig. 181) and one, dated 1667, at Frankfurt,40 the child much in the manner of Steen, give some indication of the interesting painter that he was in his younger days and of promise for the future. The painting at Haarlem can be contrasted with that from Wollaton (Fig. 182), of about 1690, a companion to the 'doctor' painting (Fig. 177), with wooden figures of exaggerated piety. Two of what must have been his rare domestic scenes are recorded in early sale catalogues: 'A Woman cutting Bread and Butter for children in his best and cleanest manner'41 and 'A woman scaping carrots'42 - both unknown today. The part played by Heemskerck II in these later paintings is indeterminate. How far he was responsible for their execution and how far responsible for the poor quality of some, or how much the variations were the result of his father's ageing or under- standable boredom at turning out so many variations on a few popular themes, can only be conjectured. However it seems reasonable to suppose that The Oxford Election, the five Quaker Meetings, the Wollaton Doctor, and the early Tavern scenes are by Heemskerck himself but that the Wollaton Grace before meat, the late Tavern scenes and several of the 'Doctor' pieces are studio productions. A number of drawings of genre scenes in several collections, attributed with varying degrees of conviction to Heemskerck I, have led to some disagreement.43 Many would appear to be early drawings, if indeed the attribution is correct, and have little relation to his work in England. HEEMSKERCK, HOGARTH, AND THORNHILL Many writers have indicated links between 'Heemskerck' and Hogarth. Nichols44 refers to Hogarth's Woman swearing a child to a grave citizen as being said to have more than an accidental resemblance to a picture by Hemskirk 'where all the male figures are monkeys; all the females cats', meaning presumably the younger Heemskerck's 127</page><page sequence="10">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK Midnight Magistrate. F. Antal45 has numerous references to the connection, mostly with the animal-headed drolleries of the younger Heemskerck, and sees the link between Hogarth's Rewards of Cruelty IV and Heemskerck's Quack Physician's Hall (Fig. 183) as 'so obvious'. R. Paulson46 remarks that 'Hogarth appears to have been aware of the elder Heemskerck's 'Quaker Meeting paintings, at least in their engraved versions (which anticipate his own style of engraving in some respects) and he was certainly aware of the satiric designs of the younger Heemskerck in the late 1720s, and notes a resemblance between Heemskerck's Prisoner in Court and Hogarth's Burlesque of Paul before Felix, particularly in the figure of Justice, the position of the Prosecutor (though reversed) and the mass of spectators.47 These associations with the younger Heemskerck's animal-headed drawings and prints seem somewhat tenuous. If a prototype for the Rewards of Cruelty is needed it is surely a woodcut Quodlibet anatomicum in Ketham's Fascículo of 1491.48 However unlikely, the resemblance between Hogarth's academically-robed and enthroned President and the Praelector of the Fascículo, also in academic gown and seated on a throne-like chair, and between Hogarth's dissector and the Prosector is unescapable, whatever the derivation of the many additonal figures which Hogarth, with his love for overcrowding, has added. Some few Dutch genre paintings were already in London in the early years of the century, but Heemskercks were plentiful and would be well known to frequenters of the sale-rooms. Hogarth would have had some access to Heemskerck's conversations through Thornhill, who owned at least one and possibly seven.49 Probably sometime in the seventeen-twenties Thornhill had made sketches of four paintings then or later in the collection of Sir Thomas Willoughby ofWollaton, the 'Doctor' (Fig. 178), two taverns and a scene of two men playing cards.50 They were acquired perhaps at the same time that Willoughby was commissioning Siberechts to paint Wollaton and the surrounding countryside. Thornhill had at an unknown date worked for Willoughby painting the Grand Staircase and other wall areas at Wollaton.51 The sketches, somewhat out of key with the rest of the sketchbook, can be explained in three ways: that the paintings were already at Wollaton; that Thornhill had sketched them in some other collection or in the sale-room; or that they were in his own collection, to be acquired from his sale by Willoughby. Nichols52 tells us of twelve pictures from Hudibras in John Ireland's sale which he referred to in his will, 'as certainly (in my most decided opinion) painted by Hogarth, as the Marriage-à-la-Mode was; and this opinion is founded on the most deliberate examination, and has been coincided in by the best judges of painting that I know'. Nichols adds a footnote that 'Notwithstanding this solemn declaration, this impor- tant series of Paintings is supposed by competent judges to have been painted by Heemskirk. ' It seems likely that they were referring to the set of twelve small scenes 128</page><page sequence="11">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK illustrating Hudibras recently in the London sale-rooms.53 In form and composition they closely resemble Hogarth's large prints of Hudibras, but are very different in the arrangement and nature of the subsidiary figures, many of which are typical Dutch drolls. The dress of some of the principal figures proclaims that the painting was not made before about 1720. If compared with Hogarth's early paintings the attribution to him is stylistically more than doubtful, and to Heemskerck the elder chronologically impossible. A possible explanation could be that they are the work of Heemskerck II, who has already been mentioned as a follower and imitator of his father, and who was given to satire, as in the animal-headed drawings, and to crude caricature. 54 Hogarth's paintings of his early years are the subject of much doubt and controversy. The Doctor's Visit (Tate Gallery) until very recently regarded as one of these early works, has now been convincingly reattributed to Heemskerk II, 55 an opinion based on a study of a number of Heemskerck 'doctor' or 'deathbed' scenes. Stylistically and technically the aggressively Dutch background figures are quite unlike the equally Dutch background figures in the Hudibras set, which adds yet another problem. In the 1806 sale of 'the Entire Stock-in-Trade of Mr Thomas Gwennap' was 'Hogarth Portrait of Hemskirk and Family'.56 Allowing for Gwennap's wild identifi- cations and attributions the two names indicate at least a traditional association. The general evidence, although circumstantial and somewhat tenuous, could be seen to suggest a closer working relationship. PATRONS AND COLLECTORS It would be unrewarding to try too vigorously to sort out Buckeridge's hierarchy of 'waggish collectors and the lower rank of virtuosi', but Heemskerck's paintings were not confined to such owners during the early years of the eighteenth century. By the 1 73 os his paintings, often acquired much earlier, were owned by a number of the nobility and gentry. Among such owners were the Earl of Rochester by 1680, 57 the Earl of Leicester by 171 1, 58 the Countess of Stamford by 1722, 59 the Duke of Ancaster by 1 724, 60 the Earl of Derby by 1729, 61 the Earl of Pembroke by 1730, 62 the Marquess of Linlithgow by 1733, 63 the Earl of Sussex64 and Sir John Evelyn65 by 1734, Lord Halifax by 1738/966 and Sir Andrew Fountaine by 173 9. 67 Of waggish collectors one could not wish for a better example than William Cartwright (1606/7-86), who left his paintings, books, and other possessions to Dulwich College. Cartwright was by profession an actor who had turned bookseller when the theatres were closed during the interregnum, and who had collected more than two hundred and fifty pictures of great variety. Owing to the dishonesty of two of his servants, Dulwich received only a fraction, but fortunately a priced inventory of 1686 in the owner's often illegible 129 K</page><page sequence="12">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK hand, made shortly before his death, has survived.68 Of the two hundred and thirty-nine paintings in this list only about eighty are now at Dulwich. His thirteen Heemskercks are not among them. Most of these were simple drolleries, single figures smoking, eating or drinking, described as 'closiť pieces, priced at from ten to thirty shillings. But he had also 'A Schulmaster &amp; scoul mistris &amp; boys &amp; girls at there books' valued at six pounds, and 'A man on his Death-bed a doctor &amp; nabors Round a bout ye bed on 3 quarters clouth' at fifteen pounds. These prices are similar to those fetched at sales up to 1760: in 1742/3 £9.9.0 for a Quakers Meeting with a Court of Justice; in 1746 fourteen shillings and sixpence for Boors at Cards; in 1749/50 ten shillings for Three small pictures with the exception of the unusually large sum of£24.2.o in 1758 for Sick Man and his family Confessor. The English had always been notably unen thusias tic about subject pictures. In Van der Doort's catalogue of paintings in the collection of Charles I only about a dozen can be recognized as genre.69 In 1641 John Evelyn showed enough interest during his visit to the Netherlands to send home several drolleries.70 The 'Dutch Gift' to Charles II at the Restoration contained only one genre painting - this by Dou. 71 There seems to have been no more than a trickle entering the country in the late seventeenth century and well into the eighteenth. By 1671 of 140 paintings at Northumberland House, Petworth, and Syon only four were genre, only one by Dou valued at sixty pounds;72 at Ham House eight years later of 188 paintings only ten were genre, although there were many Dutch landscapes;73 in 1685 Sir Richard Temple's 55 paintings at his London House included only one possible genre scene;74 of thé 142 paintings in the 1692 inventory of the goods of the outlawed Earl of Melfort only six appear to be genre pieces;75 and of the 112 paintings which Thomas Povey sold to William Blathwayt in 1693 there was only one, 'A Night peece with Monkies cloathed'.76 Even 'waggish' collectors seemed lukewarm. Other than his thirteen Heemskercks, William Cartwright had less than a dozen drolleries, several certainly indecent and others described in illiterate English - curious for an experienced actor and book- seller - 'a wich a Coungring with a kettell, in it, &amp; a gotte &amp; other spirrets about her'. Another 'waggish' collector, the Dutchman, Adriaen Beverland had, among a number of Dutch pictures, only 'A Piece of Galantery done by Lar'oen'.77 Much the same story is told by early eighteenth-century sales catalogues and printsellers' catalogues. An examination of sale catalogues in the British Library78 reveals how few genre paintings were sold in the early years of the century, even allowing for the many catalogues, now lost or elsewhere, not included in this study. Only Brouwer, Molenaer, and Steen are represented before the very important Willem van Hüls sale in 1722 when Dou, Heemskerck, Metsu, Mieris, Ostade, and Teniers were added to the list. A similar picture emerges from examination of the two 130</page><page sequence="13">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK volumes of MS copies of catalogues in the Victoria and Albert Museum Library. Frank Simpson's important article79 on these gives an earlier date for only one painter, Jan Steen in 171 5; the writer emphasizing how the taste for Dutch paintings, and for genre in particular, was a development of the middle years of the century. Solomon Gautier's 1726 catalogue of paintings, drawings, and prints is very informative:80 of 95 lots (109 canvases) only one was genre - 'A Conversation Ostade', and in the ensuing four days sale of drawings and prints, of some four thousand prints, about one thousand were Dutch but less than fifty were genre, and of these one lot was '26 Beggars by Pieter Quast'.81 Printseilers' lists are no more encouraging. In a twenty- four page catalogue in 171 7 Henry Overton has less than a score of genre prints which include 'Six Dutch Drolls after Ostade' and 'The Quakers Meeting finely engraved Laroon Pinxiť (one wonders which this was), another 'Quaker' and seven 'Merry Fancies'. Three years later Thomas Bowles's one-page list had no prints recognizable as genre but a general statement, 'At this Shop aforesaid Gentlemen may be furnished with all Sorts of French and Dutch Prints', and then specifies a number of series: 'Alexander's Battles, Luxembourg gallery, Girardon Gallery, Prospects of Versailles, Statues of Versailles, with a great Variety of Historical-peices both Prophane and Sacred', of which only some of the last group can be Dutch. In 1728 John Bowles in thirty-six pages has one - 'Man at Confession, by Hemskirk'. In about 1745, a quarter of a century after Thomas Bowles's list, there is only one item - 'Four Prints of Drolls Price is' - amongst a page listing several hundred. The paucity of advertised prints after Heemskerck is a little strange, in view of the fair number made. In the British Museum printroom are six 'taverns', four 'confes- sions', three 'schools', a Bruising Match and an interesting Man reading a letter, lettered A. V. Ostade Invent. E VanHemskirkepinx.J. Smith fee. et ex. Not until well into the middle of the century was Dutch painting in general readily accepted and then in spite of Horace Walpole's well-known 'drudging mimics' remark, a view even then quite widely held. Genre had a longer wait and it was not until the later years of the century that it reached its age of respectability with Sir Joshua Reynolds' encomium ofjan Steen. So little was it regarded that the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries saw few attempts by the many Dutch painters working in this country, other than Heemskerck, to break into the market. Even Pieter Roestraten, Heemskerck's almost exact contemporary and another long resident in England, whose Terborch-like domestic scenes, such as the Woman frying pancakes in the Bredius Museum and his Steen-like drolleries at Ugbrook suggest a greater talent, made no attempt to compete in this field. The ready, even enthusiastic, acceptance of Heemskerck's drolleries by a number of quite eminent collectors and by the market, must be seen as a curious incident, difficult to explain, in the history of English taste. 131</page><page sequence="14">EGBERT VAN HEEMSKERCK ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am much indebted to private owners and to those in charge of public collections of paintings and inventories for permission to reproduce paintings and drawings and to quote from documents.

I am most grateful to Elizabeth Einberg for information about this painting and about a number of other 'doctor' scenes: one at Gosford House and others in the sale-room of Christie's, 2july 1935 (134), 27july 1956 (78), and 2oJuly 1983 (80), and of Phillips, 20 July 1982 (58). In eighteenth-century sales 'doctor' scenes were at Prestages in 1752, in a Batt sale 1758, in the Schaub sale in the same year, and in an undated sale at The Green Door. Vertue refers to the Evelyn painting as a 'conversation' so there may well have been more among the almost 50 'conversations' listed in Appendix B. 33. For this see S.J. Gudlaugsson, De Komedianten bij Jan Steen en zijn tijdgenooten (The Hague, 1945), pp. 9-21, where three Steens are illustrated (figs 5, 11, 13), and a painting attributed to Eglon van der Neer where the doctor in Commedia dell' Arte costume is closely related to Marcellus Lauron's Mountabanck (see Raines, Marcellus Laroon , p. 36) and to a late seventeenth-century English print with an added figure of a harlequin, 'The Infallible Mountabank or Quack Doctor' (British Museum Satires, 1, no. 1032) also illustrated by Gudlaugsson. Mountebanks were possibly rather in the public eye. In 1676, two years after the Evelyn Doctor, Heemskerck's patron, the Earl of Rochester, while in exile from the Court, set up in disguise as a mountebank, Alexander Bendo, in Tower Street. For an account of this escapade see Count Grammont, Memoirs of the Court of Charles the Second, ed. Sir Walter Scott (1846), pp. 255, 387-91. 34. F. Lugt, Musée du Louvre.

Six of these, the Doctor (43 X 50 cm), the Grace before meat (43 X 50 cm), and two pairs, upright and horizontal (71 X 60 and 60 X 71 cm), of tavern scenes are by Heemskerck.

Grey and black ink wash with touches of brown ink, 21.5 X 17 cm Not by Heemskerck. Similar in compostion to the engraving by Jacob Gole but with two less figures, it is very different in style. Gole has been suggested as the author but it is unlike a drawing made for engraving. PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS IN THE MANNER OF HEEMSKERK 7 Follower of Heemskerck Friends House, London. Fig. 173 Oil on canvas, 63 X 76 cm Ref. Hull, p. 31, fig. 16; Saxl, p. 216, note 3. In a room with a high window on the left a woman, with her left arm extended and her right on her chest, is standing on a tub, addressing an assembly of twenty-one men and women and a child. From the costume this painting can be dated to 1725-30. 8 Follower of Heemskerck Friends House, London. Oil on canvas, 58 X 73.7 cm Ref. Hull, p. 28, fig. 9. A woman speaker, with right arm raised and left pointing downwards is standing on a tub speaking to an assembly of twenty-nine men and women all of Heemskerck type but not directly related to his figures. A later painting of poor quality. 9 Follower of Heemskerck Haverford College, Haverford, PA, USA. Oil on canvas, 51 X 56 cm Prov. Hoch auction rooms, Munich, 1892 Ref. Hull, pp. 31-32, fig- 18. Two men appear to be addressing a mixed assembly of twenty-five people. There are numerous references to Heemskerck figures. According to Thieme-Becker it is signed and dated 1690 but this must be incorrect as the costume is of about 1730. Perhaps it has been confused with the Welshpool painting (2) which is said to have been signed and dated. 10 Follower of Heemskerck 011 on canvas, 57.8 X 72.4 cm Prov. Sothebys, 16 May 1973 (80), bt.
