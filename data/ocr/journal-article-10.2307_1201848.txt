A reconstruction is not a revision, for it shakes foundations and is not content with minor revisions. The philosophy of religion in America has in its best moments sided with reconstruction. James, Dewey, and Whitehead bring to mind the sprit of that tradition: the past is a provisional basis for the future and religion must concern itself with the present needs of man. Such themes sum up the American angle of vision known as pragmatism. The philosophy of religion as developed by major Catholic thinkers in America has stressed revision rather than reconstruction. Given the fragmented quality of much Catholic thought on the meaning of religion-not to mention the dwindling numbers of practicing Catholics-a strategy of revision promises diminishing returns. Also, the sources upon which philosophers have drawn to stiffen the backbone of Catholi- cism tend to promote irrelevance and a consequent ineffectiveness. For whether their borrowings be from the reclaimed medieval synthesis advanced by transcendental Thomism, the evolutionary eschatology of Teilhard, or varieties of existential and 314</page><page sequence="2">Book Notes phenomenological thought, the fact remains that American experience is neglected. Since Catholicism is practiced in America by Americans, it stands to reason that their religious experience should reflect the dominant traits of that mode of coming to grips with reality. Professor Fontinell's aim in Toward a Reconstruction of Religion is to satisfy such a need. This effort is not an unexpected birth. For a quarter of a century, a number of Catholics have struggled with the claims of orthodoxy and the need for a religious framework consistent with American experience. The editors of the weekly Common- weal and Joseph Cunneen, editor of the quarterly Cross Currents, have labored to make available the thoughts of those Catholics not content with the familiar confines of Scholasticism. Academically, Robert C. Pollack, professor of philosophy at Fordham University, introduced a generation of students (among them Fontinell) to the rich- ness and significance of American thought. With the publication of this book, these efforts come to a culmination and deserve a name. There is now such a movement as the New York school, an important dimension of American Catholic intellectual history deserving notice and recognition. To reconstruct religion along lines more faithful to American experience demands, according to Fontinell, a rejection of classical metaphysics with its preference for being rather than becoming. Once religion is set upon the foundations of process rather than substance, the rest of the rooms in the Catholic edifice of faith must be redesigned. The fundamental virtue is openness, for without a mentality that wel- comes the unfinished character of the world, the capacity of religion to engage itself seriously with reality that is always in the process of becoming is decidedly diminished. From this initial ontological reconstruction, a series of radical changes ensue which test the degree to which the virtue of oneness is practiced. Four areas of religious experience require major alterations, and they are religious truth, morality, God, and religion. In the space of a short review, it is impossible to do them all justice, but a concise presentation will set the stage for the examination of a remarkable event, the marriage of pragmatism and Catholicism. For Fontinell, faith is noncognitive experience, not reducible to conventional modes of knowledge. Nevertheless, it is not free from tests, since its aim is to provide an integral vision of existence so that the life of the community is enriched by its. presence. The standard by which religious truth is judged is more severe than that used for conventional truth claims. The pragmatic test of religious truth is the difference faith as lived makes in the quality of human life. Such a public criterion precludes the charge of subjective fideism or the equally inadequate characterization of religious truth as the outcome of abstract, objective, and certain rational principles. In a similar manner, ethical prescriptions are grounded in the only suitable norm for a process world: growth through human interaction with experience. But the pragmatic test for morality is wider than that of situation ethics, for it takes into consideration not the single norm of love but the complete spectrum of relational existence, the private as well as the public, the communal and the individual. The "God question" and institutional religion are the final themes of Fontinell's reconstruction. Since faith is noncognitive, knowledge about God as he is in himself is not possible. But belief in God is not thereby granted a plenary indulgence. Again, the pragmetic test demands that belief in God makes a difference. Thus, God is a living symbol continually acquiring new importance and meaning as the community of believers evolves in the course of history. A reconstruction of the classic problem of transcendence and immanence transforms that question into the thematic of an "Other" toward which the community moves and a "Presence" within which the community dwells. Such an approach parallels the Anselmian motif of faith seeking understanding. Faith is a mode of experience requiring clarification and development; 315</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion thus, the enlistment of contemporary science, art, and culture provides an experiential matrix for understanding the meaning of God. To conclude this brief summary, religion in its institutional garb also comes under the pragmatic gun: as in the "God question," it is not a matter of the arbitrary dismissal of such institutions as the papacy or an ordained priesthood. Rather, a pragmatist views institutions as processive ways in which man shares life and shapes future experience. Those structures which cease to manifest lived faith do not require burial: they write their own epitaph-irrelevance. The church is the living ideal of all faith communities, more inclusive than any specific church. And yet, because of the reality of process, churches are required to realize that ideal in the ongoing sweep of time. A pragmatic reconstruction of religion endorses the need for organized structure but refrains from absolute commitment to fixed institutions as the way to realize the ideal of religious experience. To one familiar with the major themes of American pragmatism, this survey of Fontinell's reconstruction holds no real surprises. Its basic outlines can be found in Dewey's A Common Faith, published in 1934. Is it Catholicism, naturalism, or a fecund reconciliation of both? An answer can be found if the authentic import of pragmatism has had a bad press, being viewed as either the scene of interminable epistemological squabbles or the rationale for a third-rate version of the American dream. Such interpretations miss the essential point of the efforts of Dewey and James. Pragmatism, stripped of its cliches and distortions, is a humanism that seeks the realization of man within an ever changing welter of events. The rejection of absolutes, a priori categories of being, and reductionist schemata for the nature of man are not negative polemics, but the endeavor to open possibility to man. The growth of man through experimental pluralism and the testing of ideas in the concrete theater of actual experience are methodological tools for a humanism of becoming, not merely a prescription for scientific advance. Catholicism in its official pronouncements has not always looked kindly on such anthropomorphic perspectives. And yet its central dogmas proclaim the hominization of God and the redemption of man. It is Fontinell's commitment to that essential spirit that prompts his recourse to pragmatism. To those mired in a rigid under- standing of Catholicism, Toward a Reconstruction of Religion will read as a case study in blasphemy; nevertheless, its overriding purpose does not stray from the genuine concerns of Catholicism. The reconciliation of such seemingly opposed traditions is made possible when divine concern for man and the human quest for the ideal are given equal weight in religious experience. A pragmatic Catholicism reconstructs foundations of reality so that the conventional dualisms of Greek metaphysics vanish, to be replaced by an ontological field theory. Within the shifting contexts of that field, the merger of divinity and humanity becomes the business of religion. As such, the wedding of Catholicism and pragmatism is more than a marriage of convenience: their union gives birth to a vision of religion consistent with American experience and compatible with the fundamental message of the Gospels. Ludwig Feuerbach's dictum that theology is anthropology stood on its head sug- gests that a pragmatic Catholicism is really a disguised secular humanism. What rescues Fontinell's reconstruction from identification with secular humanism is the affirmation of faith as noncognitive. Feuerbach is correct, but as Fontinell insists, man has a right to stand on his head. When the inevitably anthropomorphic character of knowledge is joined to a narrow epistemology that accepts scientific verification as the only test of truth claims, room for faith's role in the human endeavor is wiped out. The problem with such a restrictive vision is that it rules out the better part of the human spirit. Mankind cannot live on science alone; nor can science thrive without the creative eros that drives man toward new experience. Just as Catholicism re- 316</page><page sequence="4">Book Notes quires reconstruction in the advance of human knowledge, so also does pragmatism need to widen its comprehension of the spectrum of experiences that count. Thus, reconciliation depends on a mutual generosity resulting from a recognition of all the dimensions of human experience. There are a number of negative comments that could be made about this book. One wishes that the author did not mirror so precisely Dewey's tedious style. Also, its concise structure prevents a fuller examination of issues as critical as faith and under- standing, and the individual conscience and the social code. But such complaints should not overshadow its major significance: a careful and mature effort to see through the thicket of Catholic orthodoxy and reconstruct its message along lines more compatible with American experience. Since Fontinell subtitles his work A Philosophical Probe, one can hope for a more systematic development in the future. As the first major synthesis of what has been termed the New York school, Toward a Reconstruction of Religion is a distinguished achievement and warrants examination by those interested in the future of Catholic thought at a time when the fires of Vatican II have been all but banked.
