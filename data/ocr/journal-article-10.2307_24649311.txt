<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stefan Jonsson, Subject without Nation: Robert Musil and the History of Modern Identity. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2000. 363 pages. To preface this review, I would like to apologize to the author, publisher, book review editor, and the readers of Modern Austrian Literature that this appraisal comes so long after the book's publication. Let me stress, however, that the book warrants the continued attention not only of Musil scholars, but of all students of Austrian literature and culture, and, for that matter, anyone interested in the fate of identity in modernity and postmodernity. Its argument that Musil's Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften is a significant early text dealing with issues of recent widespread scholarly interest— collective identities, belonging, ethnicity, nationhood, postcolonialism, and subjectivity—is well written, carefully developed, and convincing. Stefan Jonsson situates his book "at the intersection of literary criticism, intellectual history, and cultural theory" (xi), and he makes good on this ambitious promise. The task of reinterpreting Musil's great novel becomes one of showing where the Western world has come from—and to a great extent where we still are— in confronting the disruptions and dislocations of modernization, the collapses of European imperialism, and the ideologies and violence of the twentieth century. More specifically and of special interest to the readers of this journal, Jonsson explores why Austria was a place where what was at stake in these changes was laid bare</page><page sequence="2">110 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE perhaps sooner and more visibly than elsewhere. The author is able to take on these general questions not by abstracting from the novel, but by following it to its core. Jonsson shows the vital connection between the form and purposes of the book, and rather than considering the ideas in the text as such, he views them in the context of what he sees as the singular method of Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften-, its enactment of "negativity." Subject without Nation is divided into two main sections, "Expressivity" and "Negativity." In the first section Jonsson traces the demise of the "expressivist paradigm," which assumes that "the identity of a person is grounded in an intrinsic disposition" (7). Within this paradigm, identity is established when the disposition expresses itself practically or artistically. Jonsson explores expressivity by appealing to Georg Lukâcs's critique of subjectivity in History and Class Consciousness (1923), where Lukâcs traces three phases in the reification of expressive subjectivity in the wake of Kant and the Enlightenment: the emergence of individualism, the constitution of the subject, and the primacy of the contemplative attitude. Jonsson emphasizes that the second phase constitutes the subject and at the same time its inherent crisis—its nature as divided consciousness: "In order to realize himself as free and independent, the individual must objectify his qualities" (32). This is precisely the modern (and modernist) predicament at the heart of Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften. Jonsson criticizes most Musil scholars for having regarded Ulrich's central difficulty as the lost ability to express his subjectivity, rather than his realization that such expression does not solve the problem—it is the problem. While Jonsson's assessment of the literature is perhaps a bit too sweeping, he is fundamentally correct and does an admirable job of putting Musil's radical critique of expressivity in context. This context reaches back to Herder, Schiller, and Fichte. Jonsson sketches how Schiller saw aesthetic education as the means to heal the division of consciousness, and discusses at more length how Fichte pleaded for binding individual expressivity to national expressivity, for rooting the individual's identity in that of the Volk. According to Jonsson, the "constitution of a subjectivity divided between inward and outward tendencies is structurally determined by the historical predicament of modernity," and it "permeates all other issues, not only disputes about subjectivity" (37; emphasis in original). His central contribution stems from his insight that not split consciousness itself, but attempts such as nationalism to heal the split are the actual crisis that Musil inherited from the nineteenth century and that led to the cultural conflagrations to which he bore witness. Working through the problem of the failure of expression "has entailed unthinkable human suffering, because it is precisely the belief in an expressive link between the individual and the community that has been used to legitimize most of the horrors of the twentieth century" (37). The more elusive the link, the more extreme the attempt to forge it. Hence Jonsson sees cultural achievements from Romanticism to Expressionism as the products of mistaking the problem for the solution. He demonstrates this by analyzing femininity as an image of inward harmony, the Bildungsroman as the</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 111 performance of identity creation, the retreat of the bourgeoisie into the "intérieur" as the site of supposed wholeness, and Jugendstil as having wedded aesthetics and technology in an attempt to project this wholeness onto the practical world. His chapter on "Topographies of Inwardness" culminates in a reading of Expressionism as an attempt at expressing the subject that ended in the implicit realization that expression "is really impression" (58). In other words, the subject is not the core of identity, but a collection of impressions, an idea which, explored by Ernst Mach and Hermann Bahr for example, is fundamental to Musil's exploration of subjectivity: a man without qualities consists of qualities without a man. Jonsson's chapter on "The Architecture of Modem Identity" begins the analysis per se of Musil's novel. It first takes the tension between accident and intention in Ulrich's interior decorating as an example of a new conception of subjectivity that finds no inner reason to prefer one style over another. Then the psychotic murderer Moosbrugger is shown to be an instance of "a person who is no longer one" (85), the opposite of and hence an indictment of the expressivist paradigm. To close the chapter, Jonsson locates "the collapse of the expressivist paradigm" in the "strange spatial inversion" Ulrich experiences toward the end of Book One. He avers that it is here that Musil's interest in mysticism must be found, rather than in Meister Ekhart and the mystics that Musil knew from reading Buber's collection Ekstatische Konfessionen. Jonsson's conflation of "the models codified by religion and mysticism" perhaps does not do justice to the subversive power of mysticism, but his main point is quite right: Musil was not so much responding to ancient influences as to the "as yet unrealized possibilities of the present moment of modernity" (95). Chapter 3 ends the first section of the book with an excellent analysis of how Musil's novelistic technique is an aesthetic parallel to the psychological, philosophical, and social crises of subjectivity. Just as the subject does not possess a nuclear self, the novel does not possess a core of organized plot or time out of which the events of the novel, its "qualities," might arise: "The fragmented character of Musil's novel derives not from the fact that the story is hidden underground but from the fact that the story is continuously interrupted" (111). The novel, once the aesthetic expression of the subject par excellence, must now portray events not as they arise as the expression of some core narrative logic, but as an accretion of events. And these events provide a "grid" for the narrator's commentary: "In Musil, the real action takes place when interaction is postponed, during the intermissions, when the narrator is left to himself' (111). This is just right, although one might also analyze the irony in the "storytelling" parts of the novel as a similar subversion of standard narration. For instance, whereas Jonsson describes the disjuncture between the meteorological and everyday ways of establishing time and place in the opening paragraphs as "scientific objectivity and subjective experience, [...] two incommensurable approaches to the world" (104), he does not note that the "scientific" explanation is ironically undermined by the use of anthropomorphic language (the barometric low shows no inclination to bypass the high), tautology (the astronomical events correspond to the predictions</page><page sequence="4">112 MODERN AUSTRIAN LITERATURE in the yearbooks, not vice versa), and internal contradiction (the relative humidity is described as both low and high). Nonetheless, this does not refute Jonsson's careful analysis of the representation of time, character, and event in Musil; on the contrary, it simply applies his thesis to another level of discourse. The book's second and last section develops "Negativity" as the narrative and aesthetic consequence of the loss of expressivity. In "Toward a Theory of the Musilian Subject" Jonsson suggests that only the "emergence of later theories of subjectivity" such as those of Kristeva and Ricoeur has "brought the implications of Musil's representation of subjectivity to the surface" (168). He also situates Musil among other German-language (primarily Austrian) writers such as Döblin, Kafka, Rilke, Joseph Roth, and Broch as another instance of literary characters' identities being "reduced to a state of nothingness" and subjectivity being a function not of a self, but of its surroundings (167). Chapter 5, subtitled "The Madness of Central-European Modernity," situates negative subjectivity within German and Austrian culture by relating it to feminist questions. Salient examples of the female loss of identity, of becoming a mere function, are Wedekind's Lulu, Musil's Alpha in the play Vinzenz und die Freundin bedeutender Männer, and of course Agathe in Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften. To show, however, that the feminist problem is not just a version of expressivity denied, Jonsson discusses the "monster" Moosbrugger as a parallel case of being denied both expressivist subjectivity and access to the ruses employed by the male-run society to ignore its inadequacy. Ulrich's adherence to certain conventional behavior is brought out by Jonsson's subtle discussion of Agathe as the negative identity that defines the positive identity of a man supposedly without qualities. The treatment of the Pierrot figure in modernity (which appears in the Klee painting reproduced on the book's cover and in the harlequin pajamas Ulrich and Agathe are wearing when they meet again) is eye-opening. Jonsson makes a good case that Pierrot is the very model of negative subjectivity. For readers of Modern Austrian Literature, the last chapter, on Kakania, is a must. It draws the parallel between the nationality question in Austria-Hungary and the problems of negative subjectivity and the expressivist paradigm. Jonsson argues that ethnic groups seeking national expression put the empire in a double-bind: if it solved the problem by granting them their identities, it would abandon its reason for existence. Hence, Kakania was an "empire without narrative," a state without qualities that was making a particularly difficult transition from feudal empire to modern, capitalist nation-state. Jonsson's demonstration of how Musil constructed the Parallelaktion and its actors to show the sweep of the crisis is as good a piece of literary analysis as I have read. He also shows how Musil's concerns progressed, having as much to do with 1933 as with 1914. At the very end, after establishing negativity as the foundation of Musil's novel, Jonsson pulls back a bit to suggest that the negative space created by the loss of expressive subjectivity is also positive, for it is the space of possibility: here there is room to move, and room to change. And since</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 11: Kakania's disintegration opened up this space, Jonsson agrees with Musil: Austria Hungary was "the most progressive state of all" (270). This book is both a milestone and a benchmark in Musil scholarship. But it is also significant for Austrian and European cultural studies in general, for it shows how Musil found in inchoate form much of the post-structuralist and postmodern environment we live in.
