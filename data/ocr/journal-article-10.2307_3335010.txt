PHOTOGRAPHIC ARCHIVES, MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE, AFTER R. P. DE JAEGER (1937). In the southwestern part of the former Province Orientale, throughout the former Kivu Province, and into the northern rim of the former Katanga Province, we find a large number of dis- tinctive ethnic units which, in one way or another, are all historically and culturally interrelated. We are confronted in this region with a complex cultural continuum which, from certain points of view, tran- scends the constricting demarcations into ethnic, so-called tribal, entities. Many of these groups are not well known in the ethnographical and artistic literature on Africa. The area offers, however, a fascinating artistic output and interesting problems of interpretation. This study at- tempts to synthesize some of the data.' The total group of peoples of ultimate relevance for this analysis occupies a huge rectangle in eastern Zaire, approximately situated between the equator and 50 south, and between 240 and 290 east. This vast region is mainly dominated by ,o lowland rainforest; eastward the environ- ment changes into montane forest forma- tions and into highland savannas; southeastward the landscape transforms into open forest savannas. In this study, I am primarily concerned with the forest- dwelling populations of this region. But, obviously, the separation between groups cannot always clearly be made on such a basis because of overlappings and historical and cultural continuities. The ethnic units, then, that fall within the im- mediate scope of the analysis are the fol- lowing: Mbole (west of the Lomami River; zone Opala); Yela (Tshuapa River; zone Ikela); Lengola (between the Lomami and Lualaba Rivers; formerly Ponthierville); Mitoko-Leka (west of the Lualaba, on its Lilo tributary; formerly Ponthierville); Komo (a wide distribution in the Lubutu and Bafwasende zones); Pere (on the Lindi River; Lubero zone); Nyanga (Walikale zone); Songola (Kindu zone); Nyindu (Mwenga zone); and Lega (Mwenga, Shabunda, Pangi zones).2 This basic nomenclature does not include the many, more or less distinctive, smaller units that are found in the area and mostly mark transitions or combinations between various cultures. These small units are very typical for the area and contribute much to the overall cultural continuum. They include, for example, the Linga and Lulu between the Mbole and Lengola; the Kwame between the Komo and Lega; the Kanu and Konjo between the Nyanga and Lega; the Tembo between the Nyanga, Hunde, and Havu; and the Asa-Tiri between the Nyanga and Komo. The ethnic delineation does not do justice to differences found within each group. For example, early unpublished sources make numerous distinctions between so-called subtribes on a regional and cultural basis. East and south of these forest-dwelling peoples, we find within this general region a variety of populations that exhibit various degrees of relationships with the forest-dwellers. They include, from north to south, the Nande, Kumbure, Hunde, Havu, Shi, Nyindu, Furiiru, Vira, Bembe, Zyoba, Kasingo, Boyo, Bangubangu, and Zimba (Southern Binja). Some of these groups must necessarily be considered in discussions on art. Needless to say, then, OPPOSITE PAGE 3. ANCESTOR FIGURINE IN KASINGO STYLE, 49cm.

Many outstanding artistic traditions flourish in the forest region and the larger general area that are being discussed. The focus is on sculpture, specifically on masks, figurines, and assemblages, because they have the widest distribution and offer the greatest scope for com- parison. It must be noted, however, that there are other important sculptural tradi- tions as well. For example, the Nyanga and Nande carve beautifully decorated and patinated dishes and cups (Biebuyck 1973a); the Shi have fine wooden milkpots and the Nyanga exquisite dog bells; the Lega produce in bone, ivory, and wood an astonishing variety of miniature knives, billhooks, hammers, pegs, and pins (Biebuyck 1973b). Wooden stools with spherical seat and bottom, interconnected by six, four, or three legs, or more rarely by a massive central column, are par- ticularly well carved by the Lega, Komo, Tembo, and Nyanga. Among the Hunde there are such copper-plated stools for chiefs (Schumacher 1948, p. 186). The Pere, Bembe, and Lega make miniature stools in clay or bone and ivory, and the Lengola carve elaborate triple stools. Superb scepters, made of buffalo tail and carved ivory handles, are found among the Bembe (Biebuyck 1972), and exquisite combs among the Nyanga. Large trapezoid slit-drums and subcylindrical or funnel-shaped membranophone drums are widespread, but rarely artistically enhanced. On the other hand, some types of carvings, that are very typical in the southern adjoining Hemba and Luba areas, such as neckrests, caryatid stools, elaborately carved ceremonial spears, axes, and adzes, are absent from the region. Objects in iron or copper, such as spears, knives, arrows, necklace rings, armlets, bracelets, and anklets are widespread, varied, and of high quality, but never reach the degree of elaboration and artistic diversity that we find in the regions west of this area, among popula- tions such as the Tetela, Mongo, Ngombe, Ngala, etc. The major artworks that are found among the forest-dwelling populations of this region and some of their extensions fall into the following categories: Masks and heads 1. in wood a. face masks: Mbole, Komo, Tembo, Lega, and their extension among the Bembe (Figs. 5, 12; Biebuyck 1973b) b. masquettes: Lega (Biebuyck 1973b) c. bell masks: Bembe (Biebuyck 1972) d. plankboard masks: Bembe (Biebuyck 1972) 2. masquettes in bone and ivory: Lega, Nyindu, and Kwame (Biebuyck 1973b) 3. face masks in cloth (with beads, cowries, and feathers): Bembe (Biebuyck 1972) 4. hoods in hide (with feather adorn- ments): Nyanga (Biebuyck 1973a) 5. hoods in bark: Nyanga and Komo (Biebuyck 1973a; Moeller 1936) 6. hoods in fibers: Nyanga, Bembe, and Lega (Biebuyck 1972, 1973a-b) Outside the Lega, where there is a cer- tain abundance of masks made in dif- ferent materials, the number of masks known from the other ethnic groups is very limited. In these groups there are generally only one or two types of masks with highly restricted usages. The Bembe, however, have the greatest diversity of mask types, although they occur in small numbers. Gigantic masks are unknown, except among the Lega where outside the bwami association there exists the very tall kitende-hoods in grasses. The human face constitutes the essential motif in the mask traditions; however, because of extreme stylization, the human face traits may be almost undistinguishable in some hoods and in the bell and plankboard masks of the Bembe. Animal masks are absent; however, some Bembe and Lega masks have horns, giving them a quasi-animal appearance. Zoomorphic figurines 1. quadrupeds (dog-, antelope-, pangolin-, turtle-, and crocodile-like a. in wood: Pere (Fig. 11), Lega, and Bembe(Biebuyck 1972, 1973b) b. in bone or ivory: Lega (Biebuyck 1973b) c. in clay: Pere, Bembe, and Lega d. assemblages (stuffed hides; turtle carapace and wooden head and neck; banana stipe and quills, scales, feathers, etc.): Lega, Bembe, and Komo 2. birds in wood: Lega, Pere (Fig. 9), and Komo 3. other (snakes, fish, frogs) a. in wood, bone, or ivory: Lega (Biebuyck 1973b) The animal figurines are abundant and varied among the Lega, but rare in the other areas. Many are highly stylized while others are more "realistic" miniatures; the realism is sometimes enhanced by the addition of select ex- uviae, such as scales or beaks. Anthropomorphic figurines: 1. in wood: Mbole (Figs. 4, 7), Yela (Fig. 10), Lengola, Mitoko (Fig. 8), Bembe, Pere (Fig. 6), Komo (Fig. 1), Songola, Lega, Kwame, and other ex- tensions among the Zyoba, Kasingo (Fig. 3), Boyo, Bangubangu, and Zimba 2. in bone or ivory: Lega (Fig. 13), Komo, Nyanga, Kwame, Nyindu, Songola, Bembe, and other extensions among the Hunde, Zimba, and Bangubangu (Biebuyck 1972 and 1973b; Moeller 1936) 3. in stone: Lega 4. in clay: Pere, Lega, and Bembe 5. in resin and other materials: Lega 6. assemblages (banana stipes adorned with hats, belts, dress, sticks, and other adornment): Lega, Bembe, and Komo (Biebuyck 1973b; Moeller 1936) There is a great diversity of form, size, and volume of anthropomorphic fig- urines. Miniature figurines from two or ten inches high in wood, bone, or ivory, are highly developed among the Lega, Bembe, and other groups that seem to 240E 260E 280E 300E . -p UGANDA ........o ,. -, , rZ 1 .20s YELA 0 KWAME KONJO RWANDA LEGA  BURUNDI , 40S E G 0 TANZANIA miles0 0 61 10</page><page sequence="4">4.

Large figurines in wood are known among the Mbole, Lengola, Mitoko, Komo, and Kasingo, Zyoba, and Boyo. There is much work in wood of intermediate size among the Yela, Pere, Lega, and Bembe. The Mitoko carve tall notched poles adorned with a head or face. Among the taller figurines, there is a preference for slender figures among the Mbole, Lengola, and Komo, and for the heavier, more stocky ones among the Kasingo and Boyo; but groups like the Mitoko have both types. There is a distinct preference for full, standing figurines and for half-figurines (more than a bust). Sitting figurines are very rare; squatting ones are absent. There are many full figurines without arms, with one arm, or with only short stumps for arms. Half-figures ending in a peg or fixed onto an iron staff occur frequently among the Lega, Komo, Mitoko, and Lengola. This is also the region where double- faced, double-headed, and fully double figurines are abundant. The faces, heads, and bodies are placed in opposition, linked together, or separated from each other; however, heads and faces may also be placed in superposition, and some artworks may consist of several super- posed and opposed faces (Lega, Mitoko, Lengola). There are male, female, and sex- less carvings; female breasts are rarely rendered, but the navel area tends to be placed into perspective. In some areas wooden figurines tend to be colored white or red, entirely or in parts, but there is also a liking among the Lengola and Komo for dotting the objects. Abstract figurines (reminiscent of a bell, pole, or phallus shape) 1. in wood: Pere, Komo, Lega, Hunde 2. in bone or ivory: Lega, Komo These objects may be much more widespread and diverse, but full documen- tation is lacking. The famous so-called trumpets of the Pere apparently fall into this category, although I believe that they are connected with the Nyanga zoomorphic figurines (Biebuyck 1974). It is appropriate to indicate that many arts of this region have remained hidden from the Western museums and observers for a long time. For example, the first Pere and Yela artworks arrived in the Mus6e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale (Tervuren) only about 1936 and 1938. No works were ascribed to the Kasingo and Zyoba (Goma and Ciba) before 1955 (Biebuyck collection at Tervuren); no Nyanga carv- ings and masks were known until my Nyanga field research (which began in 1954). Some other areas were poorly documented; few genuine objects are as yet known from certain groups, such as Mitoko, Komo, or Tembo. As far as cer- tain other groups are concerned, we know that there are (or were) artworks; to my knowledge, however, none have been identified as such in the existing collec- tions. Confusion has been added to the general paucity of data: Bembe works were listed as Lega; Boyo or Kasingo works were identified as Bembe; Pere as Komo; Zyoba as Bembe. The separation of individual artworks into different ethnic areas is not always easy because of overlappings, continuities, and the general paucity of precise information. Some Yela works are close to Mbole, Lengola to Mitoko, Komo to Mitoko, Lega to Bembe; and there are the various problems of ascription between Bembe, Zyoba, Kasingo, and Boyo, which will be discussed later in this study. It is certainly no coincidence that many of these artworks formed a "hidden" art in their own social context. Much of this art was not commonly known to all the members of the society; it was seen only at certain irregular intervals, for short periods of time, by a selection of persons. For the most part, the art objects were kept in bags, baskets, caves, in houses, shrines, or on tombs with restricted ac- cess. In other words, the bulk of the artworks is associated with some of the great mysteries of these peoples. In the existing literature on African art, little justice has been done to this vast region. The main emphasis has been on Lega, and occasionally on some of the other groups, especially Mbole. In general, the information provided is scanty and incomplete. Early works on the art of Zaire, by Coart and de Haule- ville (1906) and Maes (1935; 1938) have practically no information on the area. Maes (1935, pl. XVI) makes a hopeless confusion, ascribing to the Bemba and the ABOVE: 5. MBOLE MASK, 45.9cm. MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRI- QUE CENTRALE. LEFT: 6. PERE DOUBLE FIGURINE, 21cm.

Maes (1938) reproduces a Mitoko house (and grave) with figurines. Von Sydow (1930, pp. 456-466) gives, as part of his discussion on the Urua-styles, important information on the Boyo, Bembe, Zimba, Kalanga, and Holoholo, but none on the other groups. Kjersmeier (1937, pp. 12, 32-34, 37) briefly mentions the Bembe and Zimba, and discusses the Lega. Gaff6 (1945, pp. 55-56), has some information only on the Lega. In his monumental work Olbrechts (1946, pp. 82, 89, 90-93) discusses the Lega as a transition between the northern and southern styles; he places the Mitoko in his northwestern style region, and views Bembe, Boyo, and Holoholo as part of the east Luba substyle [see also "Stylistic Analysis of African Art: A Reassessment of Olbrechts' 'Belgian Method'," this issue, page 46]. For the rest, however, his data do not in- dicate whether there is any art between the Lega, on the one hand, and the Bwa, Mangbetu, and Zande, on the other hand. Maesen (1959) is the first to complete some of the gaps, placing the Bembe and Lega as a transitional group in his stylistic region 6, and recognizing the Mbole and Komo in his stylistic region 7. In Um- bangu (1960) Maesen provides new documentation on the Lega, Bembe, Lengola, Pere, and Mbole. In his 1950 study he had already noted that Komo, Mbole, and Mitoko art was influenced by the Lega. In subsequent works by Fagg (1965, 1970), Himmelheber (1960), and Leuzinger (1960, 1971), very few new data 1OPPOSITE PAGE: 7.

Maesen (1976) discusses some new details about the Bembe, Lega, and Mbole, but does not attempt further classification. Delange (1967, pp. 170-173) places the arts of the Mbole, Mitoko, Lengola, Pere, Bembe, Boyo, and Lega together with other northern arts in the eastern Congo artistic zone. Cornet (1971, pp. 227-234) furnishes the as yet most complete picture of the area. In his southeastern stylistic group, he dis- tinguishes among others the Luba region, which includes the Boyo and Bembe, and the Lega region, which encompasses the Lega, Lengola, Mbole, and Yela. Under the denomination Lengola, he subsumes such other groups as Komo and Mitoko, and concludes that between the arts of the Lega group there is a strong Lega- influenced bond. Bascom (1973, p. 1974) groups the Lega, Bembe, Mbole, Mitoko, "and perhaps others" together as a dis- tinctive southern portion of his bipartite "northeastern Congo" stylistic region. In Art from Zafre, Cornet (1975, pp. 124- 128) adds new examples from the Lengola and Komo, but does not draw any new conclusions. Thus, the arts of the eastern Zaire forest region, and some of their extensions, have slowly and modestly emerged from obli- vion. As the knowledge of the area has in- creased, the tendency has been to place these arts together in a distinctive, but in- adequately characterized, stylistic region. The southeastern limit of this region con- tinues to cause problems, partly because of the non-recogniton of the many dis- crete, yet interlinked, stylistic traditions that exist among the Bembe properly speaking; the submerged and transitional groups among them (Kasingo; Goma; Ciba); and the political divisions of the Boyo (such as Hucwe, Beniabemba, and Sumba). All peoples in this area speak Bantu languages. Linguistically, however, they represent various subdivisions within the Bantu languages.

MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE many sources, most of these populations belong to his Zone D. This zone com- prises the following constitutent entities: the Mbole-Ena group, including the Mbole, Lengola, and Mitoko; the Lega- Kalanga group, including the Lega, Komo, Songola, Zimba, Bangubangu, and Holoholo (or Kalanga); the Bira- H uku group, including the Pere; the Kon- jo group, including the Nyanga and Nande; the Bembe-Kabwari group, in- cluding the Bembe, Boyo, Shi, Havu, and H unde. The Yela, on the other hand, belong to the Tetela group which is part of his Zone C. This classification is far from being definitive. Guthrie (1948) observed, "There are reasons for not placing any of these groups in the neighboring zones, but few, apart from geographical contiguity, for making a zone out of them." Over the years various linguists have classified these groups in different ways, without at- tempting to make a larger synthesis. For example, the Pere are sometimes grouped among the Komo (Burssens 1954, De Rop 1960); the Bembe and Nyanga with the Lega (De Rop 1960); the Bembe, Boyo, the northern and southern Binja (i.e., Songola and Bazimba), the Lengola, Mitoko, and Holoholo with the Lega (Meeussen 1953 Burssens 1954); the Mbole with the Mongo. Whichever form A 4F. IWA? ?~~~ ~~ .. . ... 11. PERE ANIMAL FIGURINE, 13.5cm. MUSEE ROYAL DE L'AFRIQUE CENTRALE they take and problems they raise, the linguistic classifications indicate sweeping relationships and interconnections between the peoples of the area, across the forest, and into the savanna. This is not contradicted by the historical traditions. Some groups claim remote or closer com- mon origins, and these relationships do not always relate to whole ethnic units, but to sections of them. The Lega have close connections with the Bembe and remote ones with the Mitoko, Komo, Songola, Bangubangu, and Zimba (Biebuyck 1973, pp. 8-10); the Lengola trace them with some Komo and Mitoko; the Pere with some Komo, Nande, and Nyanga; the Nydnga with the Hunde and Kumbure; the Tembo with the Hunde, etc. There is also a long history of contact and mutual cultural influence. For exam- ple, in vast areas now inhabited by the Nyanga, Hunde, Tembo, Havu, and Shi, earlier Lega migrations had left many traces; the Komo expanded into the Lengola and Nyanga territories; the Lengola into the Mitoko; the Bembe into the Boyo and Zyoba; the Lega into Mongo- and Luba-derived segments of populations. In this process, the earlier mentioned small transitional groups also developed, which are now welded between the main ethnic units. Pygmy influences were profound throughout this region. Small groups of them still exist in various places under such names as Batwa and Bambote, but everywhere their memory is vivid and their influence prominent in the ritual and artistic spheres. For example, the founding ancestor of the Lega is said to have married a Pygmy wife, which is one way to emphasize the close early con- nections between Lega and Pygmies. Groups like the Nyanga and Hunde in- separably link Pygmies with their early migrations. Among the Nyanga, Hunde, Havu, and Shi, the enthronement rites of chiefs require participation of Pygmies, to whom vital ritual roles are attributed. The religious systems of these peoples include divinities explicitly said to be of Pygmy origin. Among the Bembe there is a special cult for a kind of nature spirits identified with the Pygmies. The impact of the Pygmies on the hunting culture, on certain aspects of the technology and material culture, and on the artistic culture (most directly on oral literature, music, and dance) is profound. The peoples of this region are at the convergence of different population movements and population strata. We witness in this part of Za1re the encounter of Pygmies; ancient pre-established groups of unknown origin, attested everywhere under many different names and mostly submerged among the later ar- rivals; representatives of the Lega, Komo, Nyoro (Nyanga, Kumbure, Hunde) and Rwanda migrations; easternmost off- shoots of the Mongo and northernmost offshoots of the Luba and Bemba (Lunda) expansion. In the subsequent process of contact between them, a great many cultural traditions were transmitted from group to group as the result of overlap- ping, expansion, and conscious borrow- ing. Regardless of the differences, there is among the forest-dwelling peoples of this region a strong underlying uniformity in culture which manifests itself in certain vital institutions, some of which are par- ticularly relevant to the study of art. Some of these vital institutions extend into related savanna-dwelling groups, such as Hunde or Bembe. In order to understand the social framework within which the art of this region functions, I must draw at- tention to some of these common institu- tions. Patrilineal ideology underlies the descent, succession, and inheritance system. The basic units of social organization-partially dispersed clans and localized lineages of various size and span-are based on this patrilineal princi- ple. However, the social and ritual role of mother's people (and in some areas, those assimilated to them, such as father's 14</page><page sequence="8">mother's or mother's mother's people) is extremely important; it counterbalances the patrilineal system and exercises a profound influence on the structure of residential groups, on intergroup relationships, and ritual procedures. With the exception of the Nyanga, who like the Hunde have maintained their Nyoro centralized political traditions, all other groups are constituted as stateless societies. Some are organized into com- plex, segmentary lineage systems, others in networks of autonomous village com- munities. Certain concepts associated with the divine kingship institutions of the Nyanga and Hunde have variously in- fluenced some of the other forest-dwellers, such as Kongo and Pere. These lineage and village organizations are strangely complicated by the widespread voluntary associations. Membership in these hierarchically structured associations is wide-ranging, including males and sometimes females of various age and degree of social maturity; it is conditioned by many criteria (kinship; character; fees, and exchanges) and by a system of multi- ple prolonged and secret initiations. In most of these societies there is one dominating association, such as lilwa among the Mbole and Yela; bukota among the Lengola and Mitoko; nsindi among the Pere; bwami among the Lega, Bembe, Kwame, Nyindu, and sections of other populations such as Songola, Zimba, and Bangubangu; mpunju (or mbuntsu) among the Nyanga, Komo, and Kwame. Such associations play in- tegrative roles in these societies and dis- charge many political, social, educational, ritual, and artistic functions. They are the main patrons and users of the sculptural art in this region. There are close similarities in structure, organization, function, and ideology between these as- sociations. In one way or another they are historically related, but in the absence of in-depth documentation this cannot easily be shown. However, the common origin of bwami, mpunju, and bukota seems to be a certainty. Boys' initiation rituals are of central significance in the region. They occur un- der various names among the Komo, Pere, Nyanga, Lengola, Mitoko, Lega, Kwame, Kanu, Songola, Nyindu, Bembe, and Bangubangu. This is a sharp break with most of the savanna-dwellers, such as Hunde, Havu, Shi, and Boyo, where these initiation rituals are absent. Again, there is an underlying unity to these initiations and possibly a common origin, which is placed by some groups among the Komo. These initiations, practiced for mature boys, are organized at intervals and cyclically by persons who occupy specified positions within the voluntary associa- tions or by persons who are constituted as corporations. The boys' initiations in- volve prolonged seclusion and systematic learning. Highly secret musical instru- ments (bull roarers, mirlitons, bamboo tubes, talking sticks) and artworks, placed under the ultimate control of the members of the voluntary associations, are essential in these initiations. Specialized, fully constituted corpora- tions of healers (male and female) do exist in most of the region. Membership in these corporations implies initiation; heal- ing practices sometimes involve artworks. Ancestial cult, of different forms and with various degrees of intensity and complex- ity, is practiced throughout the region. However, it is not directly linked with sculpture, except when we reach outside the forest, the critical area of the Bembe and Boyo. There are numerous other common cultural features in this region, which are not of direct relevance for this study. Their combination with the above- mentioned features adds greatly to the un- ity and uniqueness of the region. We can mention only a few of them: bark cloth as clothing; the weaving of raffia; trapezoid, wooden slit-drums and subcylindrical and funnel-shaped drums; the absence of xylophones; shell money; backrests of aereal roots besides stools; rectangular houses; hunting ideology; significance of banana growing; distribution of the great oral epics (Boone 1936, 1951; Laurenty 1968, 1974; Loir 1935; Maes 1929, 1930; for other general characteristics of the area see also Vansina 1966, passim). Against this background, we can now make a more detailed analysis of the art and its social context. The second install- ment of this study will appear in the April 1976 issue.

Between 1949 and 1960, 1 did field research in various parts of this general region: Intensive field research among the riverains of Lake Tanganyika (the so-called Zyoba, or Bwari, Sanze, Goma, Ciba), the Bembe, the Lega, and the Nyanga; extensive research among the Pere, Nande, Komo, Kwame, Konjo, Tembo, Kumbure, Havu, Shi, Nyindu, Vira, Furiiru, and Boyo. The support of I'Institut pour la recherche scientifique en Afrique Centrale (IRSAC) is gratefully acknowledged. The present study draws heavily on these field data, many of them not yet published. Some of the information is also derived from un- published reports, written by administrators and missionaries, which I was able to consult during my field research. Other documents were also made available to me, in the course of my recent NEH- sponsored research at the Musee royal de I'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren. The generous help and advice provided by Huguette Van Geluwe, Albert Maesen, and their staff is deeply appreciated. The sup- port of NEH for my research on Central African art is also gratefully acknowledged. 2. Some of the riverain groups of the Lualaba River, called Enya (or Genya), and the Ngengele of the Kindu zone, are also part of this forest culture.
