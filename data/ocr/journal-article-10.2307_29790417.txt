<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHNICITY, POWER AND PREBENDALISM: THE PERSISTENT TRIAD AS THE UNSOLVABLE CRISIS OF NIGERIAN POLITICS Chudi Uwazurike Chudi Uwazurike is Professor of Sociology and International Studies at City College, City University of New York, in New York City. Nigeria has in many respects come a long way since the early, teething years of self-rule and independence from a British Empire in its twilight. It is today, a much wealthier, infrastructurally developed and bustling nation moving at a frenetic pace of political, intellectual and cultural ferment. Yet, it is far from being a nation at peace with itself. For one thing, it seems to have spent the last 30 years since the 1966 overthrow of the First Republic, dealing with the same triad of forces which had, in part, prompted the bloody mayhem of the idealistic Young Turks: acrimonious ethnicity in national life, regional power imbalance, and unrelenting official corruption. Without resolving these recurrent, even worsening dilemmas, Nigeria will continue to suffer from an image of instability injurious to economic progress, social stability and international respectability. The single most critical factor that has spun a red ribbon across most of the nation's travails, remains malignant ethnicity, both as a mask for class privilege and as the most viable means of mass mobilization. Taken together, those three variables have not changed since the 1940s when the task of national integration really began at a more intimate level. More recently, this tripodal realpolitik in Africa's most populous nation, led it in part, to the internal preoccupation that resulted in the sharpest international outrage at the country since the genocidal bloodletting of 1966-67, and the gruesome war of attrition that followed. The series of bungled activities by the military regime from 1985, culminating in the hanging of the Ogoni activist and Dialectical Anthropology 21: 1-20, 1996. ? 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</page><page sequence="2">2 environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995 sent shock waves as to the extent of repression of which the military was capable.1 The abrogation of the 1993 General Elections ostensibly won by a politician from outside the conservative, northern governing coalition, and the arrest of prominent skeptics, including General Olusegun Obasanjo, a former military leader reputed to have been the only African leader to hand over power to elected civilians before 1990, raised a number of larger, rather urgent questions. Among them are whether the country once described as "a mere geographical expression," could ever move beyond the many fetters surrounding its birth in 1914 and weaning in the 1959-60 period to a broad-based system legitimacy. Is the otherwise largely gifted nation destined for yet more disasters?and will the proposed Fourth Republic "rotational consociationalism" make critical, binding difference? What happens, if it does not? Clearly, the collapse of the Nigerian Second Republic, and the stillbirth of the Third Republic, and now the experimental consociationalism2 plans for a Fourth Republic, renew questions about Nigeria's ultimate political future. I. On the Limits of the Prebendal State As commentators have noted since the 1950s, Nigeria has been at a crossroads all its history and the confusion is far from abating.3 Yet it could be argued that the recent soul-searching induced by the demise of the still-born Third Republic and the subsequent earth-shaking regime crises, suggest that after a generation, Nigeria reached a turning point. This paper argues that the post-civil war military bureaucratic, yet lopsided, geoethnic locus of power may have run its course in Nigeria. It has essentially been overtaken by internal social changes in a country whose populace has grown deeply skeptical of authoritarian military dictators and civilian leaders largely drawn from one section of the country. Perhaps more decisive have been the enormous changes in the post-Cold War international arena, as unelected military regimes with narrow bases have become suspect. In many places?no less so in Africa where the second "wind of liberation," in the 1986-92 period, following the Philippines "flower revolution" and the subsequent crack-up of the authoritarian Soviet east bloc national, transformed the 1990s?military regimes are now</page><page sequence="3">3 seen as anachronistic relics from the past. From the IMF and the World Bank to the United Nations, free enterprise democratization has become the catchword. The Nigerian experience could be said to fall into a neat five-fold historical phases, as follows: (I) state formation and the colonial arrangement, 1914-1960; (ii) politics and society in the First Republic, 1966-1970; (iii) military intervention, crises and civil war 1966-1970; (iv) The Second Republic of elected officials and the collapse of the petroleum-fueled economy 1979-1983; and (v) the "permanent transition" of the army generals who have run Nigeria since 1984, initially expected to run to 1986, then to 1990; by 1996 the earliest projection runs to 1998. Each of these phases witnessed the adoption of certain developmental strategies, implying certain assumptions and a particular style of policy implementation the consequences of which form part of the continuing series of crises since the Second Republic. From a political sociological viewpoint, the amorphous and exceedingly complex nature of democracy in fragile states should be analyzed from at least three perspectives. Firstly, in terms of the relationship between state and civil society: the nature of power and the arrayed interest groups; the pattern of social stratification?the old saw about who gets what and why. The nature of the economy and of the impact of external economic factors become part of the determining equation here. Secondly, the nature and pattern of charismatic leadership, party organization, and the implications of the preferred styles of mobilization for democracy. The potential neutrality of key institutions such as the military has continued to command scholarly attention. Thirdly, in terms of the reaction by the articulate political literati, especially in cases of failure, of what went wrong and of future alternatives. But it needs to be restated that the outlines of the Nigerian system are clear enough: a prebendal system whose ethos now permeates down through the culture, Nigeria has become the creation of an elite in place since the oil era. The stakes have become much higher from a political economic standpoint. As Richard Joseph aptly analyzed in his now celebrated insight on the Nigerian case, the issue has always been one of the search for "prebends"?the parceling out of national</page><page sequence="4">4 resources to leading elites in different regions beholden to the ruler at the center.4 Thus Nigeria, with an elite segment anchored in a system of prebendalism and similar privileges, is turned into a rentier state where its most dynamic core exchanges state patronage for real production and a stake in the world market beyond their narrow base. Prebendalism essentially rests on geoethnic calculations intertwined with the constantly evolving context of class privilege. Thus, ethnicity, power and class become the central factors in understanding the functioning of Nigeria's bourgeois authoritarianism. II. Unbridled Ethnicity and its Consequences The single dominant factor in the Nigerian political experience, ethnicity, remains the pervasively perceived dilemma of inequitable geoethnic relationships?masking as it does, the reality of social class interest formation?over scarce resources, and control of the central state apparatus. The ethnic structure of the Nigerian state has long been understood as one of the most complicated on the continent. Of Africa's 800 ethno-linguistic groups, 250 or over 30 percent, are to be found in Nigeria alone. Among these are some of the largest and anthropologically most materially complex in Africa?the Hausa and the Fulani of the upper north, largely Moslem, living in politically-bounded Islamic emirate kingdoms, and who, through a series of military and religio-political events (of which the Othman dan Fodio empire-building jihads of the early 19th century were the most crucial), have melded into one cultural-ideological entity?a major uniting factor in the post-independence era; the Yoruba of the southwestern states, whose constitutional monarchical tradition and religious pluralism would place them in a disposition to substantially benefit from the British-fostered colonial economy and educational system centered in their coastal entrepot of Lagos; and the Igbo of the southeast whose pronounced egalitarianism found expression in Athenian style community democracy based on the rights of all freeborn, and on organized competitive military-laboring age-grade cohorts, a disposition again that would foster a competitive inter-clan thirst for Western education in the years ahead. Though these three groups number in the tens of millions, accounting for over 65 percent of</page><page sequence="5">5 Nigeria's near-100m. population, other large geoethnic entities, the "minorities" exist; with perhaps much more to lose otherwise, they have tended to be the main centripetal bulwark in the disintegrative competition between the "big three." These include the Bini, the Efik-Ibibio, the Ijaw-Kalabari, the Tiv-Idoma, the Gwari, each group of which numbers in the millions, larger than some independent African states. As Figure 1. shows, each group, in an accidental reality that conforms to Hegel's notion of "the cunning of history," is also geographically defined, with its own particular political culture. Despite a century of modern urban interaction, the hold of geographically defined ethnicity has proven to be an anchor of the Nigerian system. Notions of citizenship remain defined in ethnic ancestral terms. Not even in the long-term national capital of Lagos may an "outsider" be sure of successfully mounting an electoral campaign?or even to function effectively in professional or business organizations, without coethnic support, a factor that in part led to the decision to move the capital to Abuja. Figure 1 shows the outlay of the various major ethnic formations north and south. Ethnicity and Political Patterns N Hausa-Fulani Nupe Feudal social structure 70% Moslem Yoruba Bini Urhobo Constitutional kingship 50% Christian Tiv-Idoma Igbo Efik-Ibibio Ijaw Segmented clan democracies 95% Christian 50% Moslem Figure 1.</page><page sequence="6">6 This anthropomorphic reality has, as in most other multiethnic societies?Sudan, Ruanda-Burindi, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia for instance?had bloody consequences. The dread of potential "domination," both real and apparent has further shaped the politics of the Second Republic; and not even the hierarchical, more nationalist military has been immune from its overwhelming implication in times of intense conflict. It is important, in studying democratic regimes to pay as much attention to the form?as to the content of political praxis. In other words, it is not enough to understand that the constitutions might be drawn up to include the most libertarian fads of the day on human rights and parliamentary procedure, but also to appreciate the sociological underpinning of political life. The grand structures of constitutions, electoral systems and trade missions are thereby not rendered irrelevant?indeed they are powerful arbiters. Yet politics is about people, cultural entities, and the positive or negative skew of the public "mood"?cynical or upbeat, foil of exaggerated expectations or of mounting frustrations, in the familiar cliche?such as it is. This has always proven a variable to be ignored only at serious cost. Thus the Nigerian pattern has witnessed a number of outcomes: the far-from neutral divide et impera tactics of the British in a bid to disorganize nationalist forces; the rapid collapse of the nationalist center and retreat to ethnic strongholds; and the random violence that eventually led to an ethnically-colored coup d'etat, and a gruesome civil war that was seen in the typical Nigerian double-conceptualization, both as an ethnic settling of scores, and as a war of "national unity." The 1993 crisis brought to a head some of the limitations of a lopsided power balance in a multiethnic federal polity. What might have happened had the presidency been won by the Hausa-Fulani candidate, Bashir Tofa is debatable. Speculation is that, first, Babangida, then Abacha and the northern emirs might have accommodated him and his conservative National Republican Convention, NRC.5 Thus, regardless of the various constitutional and extra-constitutional ex post facto arguments advanced for the annulment, the perceived threat to the thirty-year power imbalance, certainly counts as a factor.6</page><page sequence="7">7 II. The State in Nigeria: Conservative Authoritarianism What is the character of the Nigerian state? This is important, largely because, despite its unsettled jurisprudential, if not sovereign, profile?is it a federal or unitary state, are its nationals citizens or subjects, is it a voluntary association or a coerced patchwork of sub nationalities, a mere agglomeration of ethnicities??a pattern is discernible. Understanding this is pertinent to any analysis of the future direction of the polity. Accordingly, one could argue that the Nigerian state consists of three discernible factors?its colonial origins and the legacy of a notion of the state as an alien entity whose legitimacy rested largely on its coercive and extractive rights. Given the external control and the racial-economic justification for the peculiarities of the colonial state, the society-state alienation has been such that decades after the transfer of power began (ca. 1952, with a central cabinet in Lagos), the primary identity-shaper remains the ethno-regional domain, as mediated by class and occupational variables; the state in its turn has been an "it" or a "they"?often seen as being captured by some ethnic rival or other?as opposed to the "we" of clan and ethnic group. This tendency has persisted even as the federal state has grown enormously in size. Yet the desire in an opposite direction, included in the broad ambit of the state apparatus and of policy, has also remained a powerful one. Nigerian society is indeed a paradox of continuities and discontinuities. Though the 250 geoethnic and cultural-linguistic units coexist in various stages of cooperation and conflict?recalling India?the onset of development and the gradually improving nationalist credentials of the state itself, had until 1993 served to undermine the primordial centrifugal tendencies. Yet the size of the state, and the fact that, so far, the northern states have maintained a disproportionate hold on central power, constitute some of the most crucial tension points in the system. Northern politicians and military officers have run the Nigerian state apparatus for over 90% of the entire post-independent period?a fact that once occasioned one of them, the retired general T. Y. Danjuma (though a Christian Middle Belter) to issue a call which, while rejecting the diarchy argument,</page><page sequence="8">8 nevertheless recognized the loaded implication of this fairly accidental reality for the years ahead.7 Still, the debate over how power came to be so sharply skewed in favor of the north hardly begins to abate, and has been a main issue in the past thirty years. Others would argue that this was hardly accidental, given what was even then seen as the thinly-veiled attempt by the British colonial authorities to manage their succession in I960.8 Clearly the refusal of the Willinik Commission on the Fears of Minorities in 1958 to recommend the creation of more states or the need to alter the un-federal British legacy of a single region being virtually twice the size of each of the other two regions, has never ceased to amaze, and continues to raise questions about Britain's good intentions. It certainly cost over a million lives to rectify by the time when, in 1963, 1967 and again in 1976 and even more recent times, states were created with apparent ease?despite British insistence, a mere eight years earlier, that state creation was potentially destabilizing!9 Other, perhaps more pertinent reasons could include the huge economic disparities between the far more opulent south and the north, making control of power a central redressing mechanism on the part of the north, even though the origin again lay in the British desire to keep the vast region as commercially "unspoilt" and serenely traditional as possible. Ethnic identity formation, the opportunistic mobilizational efforts of charismatic leaders and the nature of party formation, especially in the First Republic, provide better explanations of the cleavage patterns. Thus no explanation of Nigerian politics may be complete without an anatomy of the agenda-setting capabilities of the grand geoethnic leaders?Nnamdi Azikiwe among the Igbo, following the collapse of his nationalist ambitions; Ahmadu Bello, hardly bothering with a wider viewpoint but preoccupied with religious proselytizing and the unity of the relatively backward northern region; and Obafemi Awolowo, who, starting from a Yoruba sub-nationalist viewpoint, proved incapable of substantially moving beyond his secure regional base. Yet to a significant extent, especially in the Second Republic, each leader maintained a nationalist rhetoric that belied the Nigerian realpolitik. As the electoral returns of the Second Republic demonstrate, the "trap" of ethnicity was a powerful fact of political life: it would, however, begin</page><page sequence="9">9 to break down in the 1983 elections as class and interest group positions, despite the controversies leading to the military putsch, became more evident. Apart from the leadership and the crises entailed in the absence of a clear charismatic hero among the "big" three, as well as the contradictions of the formal organs of political life?the bureaucracy, the media, the state itself?yet another crucial variable relevant for an understanding of Nigerian politics is the military establishment. As various commentators have long noted, the military, which under colonial rule had been the effective force de frappe that beat down the numerous revolts and ensured the hegemony of the colonial state, was a major factor?along with the hated tax collector?in the perception that the gulf between state and society was widening.10 Following the expansion of political opportunities, the military witnessed a relatively quiescent period of neutral professionalism between 1952 and 1965. But this situation was destined, as in the rest of Africa, not to last; the overthrow of the First Republic in January 1966 marked the first of five significant interventions and as many failed attempts in three decades. It could be argued that, since the early seventies, the Nigerian military has gradually come to perceive the material perquisites and social rewards of office as preferable to the dreary discipline of the barracks. The psychological context of power, as in Latin America and the Middle East (Egypt and Syria, most notably), is such that once the exercise of untrammelled power becomes habituated, a desire for a continuation is almost inevitable; the military for better or worse, will continue to figure in the Nigerian policy arena in the future. Indeed, some legal minds already consider the military stranglehold on political life a form of internal colonialism,11 recalling, to use a far-fetched scenario, the dominance of Afrikaners in apartheid South Africa. Hence the spate of coups indicates that the military may well become transformed into a state "f?r sich" The twenty-six years?of the thirty-six?in which the military has run a unitary (as opposed to Federal) state structure, makes it an even more serious factor in any prognosis for the future. These factors were very evident in the gyrations of the Babangida transition that led to the June 12, 1993 set? back for democracy in Nigeria.</page><page sequence="10">10 HI. Prebendalism and Class: Interest Group Economics Ever since the First Republic, in seeking causal explanations for the collapse of the two democratic regimes, scholars have correctly focused attention on the nature of the political economy, dependent and comprador as it was, as well as on the ethnic-distorted pattern of class formation, the fractious inter- and intra-ethnic reality itself and on the ambitions of an increasingly corporatist military. Liberal writers would, in addition, point to the unfamiliarity with the constitutional structures imposed or borrowed, stressing instead the evolutionary nature of political learning, for instance. Would the politicians have learnt and perhaps, self-corrected themselves in the absence of repeated military interventions? Radical writers see it as but the inevitable outcome of a contradiction-ridden bourgeois set-up.12 It is perhaps possible that, using the stages-of-development approach (despite the Rostovian controversy concerning economic growth theories of the early sixties), there are cyclical "overdetermining" factors at play at different historical periods. Thus the weight of given socioeconomic and/or political factors, could lead to what Juan Linz characterizes as "unsolvable crisis."13 Such overdetermination was clearly at play in the two participatory democracies in Nigeria, 1960-1966, and 1979-1983, respectively. But clearly, a pattern of class and interest-group articulation is in process in Nigeria today. It has been argued that seven such categories are identifiable: the armed forces; the bureaucratic elite; the chiefly estate; the civilian political class; the business magnates and their surrogates; organized labor unions; the intellectual-technocratic segment, some of whom are active as policy intelligentsia, or as critical human rights activists, or perhaps as print media columnists devoted to raising consciousness. The eighth interest group, that of the peasantry and associated "popular" forces, have proven to be not sufficiently organized to affect national politics.14 These interest groups have been long in emergence, despite their general lack of self consciousness. But their linkage to the economy, their claims and orientation in more recent times, suggest greater organizational awareness?though hardly at a level where they could provide alternative mobilizational options.</page><page sequence="11">11 In both the Balewa and the Shagari republics, Nigeria operated a multiparty democratic, open economy led by the same geo-ethnic and ideologically conservative forces and manifesting almost precisely the same political tendencies, despite the passage of over a decade in between. Three differences existed however. Where the first had been nominally a neo-British Westminster model, the Second Republic functioned as a neo-American Presidential pattern. Secondly, the country was undeniably more opulent: where Nigeria had been an agrarian, poverty-stricken nation in the 1950s and '60s with a GNP per capita of under $100 and less than 50 million people, it had become, by Shagari's time, a nation tempered by war, gradually attaining a general level of incipient nationalism, with a population stretching toward 100 million, and a per capita income that hovered a little short of $1000. Though inflationary spirals tended to reduce the effective purchasing power of this ten-fold increase?owing largely to an oil largesse that poured over $50 billions into the coffers of the state between 1972 and 1983?there is little doubt that in capitalist terms, the free-wheeling Nigerian economy had undergone tremendous expansion. The state has grown even faster. Thirdly, though the Biafran civil war had settled the question of the legitimacy of the territorial integrity of the nation, the question of perceived geo-ethnic injustice still ran a strong delegitimating current, a view whose salience and urgency, to be sure, depended very much on winning and losing coalitions; often class and ethnicity tended to appear intertwined in a contradictory embrace. Beside these factors, little else changed. In a predictable replay in the Second Republic, a similar cycle of mismanagement, corruption, violence and electoral gerrymandering had culminated in an "unsolvable crisis," when the economic recession that began late in 1981 persisted, as the world oil market continued its headlong slump. A more credible regime may have had a fighting chance of finding equilibrium beyond a given crisis of legitimacy, however severe; the plaintively confounded second republic stood little chance. Two things further stood out in the Nigerian Second Republic: the emergence of a self-conscious power-elite, narrowly defined and aristocratic,15 as well as the greater degree of illicit kleptocratic accumulation by the well-connected. This process was characterized by all the</page><page sequence="12">12 socioeconomic complexities of the half-hearted import-substitution phase of industrialization of the departing military suddenly giving way to a loss of legitimacy, owing to this acquisitive ethos which Sayre Schatz has labeled "pirate capitalism," as noted above. An unsolvable crisis generally consists of an epicenter?and a range of socio-psychological contributing causes, such as the general acceptance of the regime, the degree of corruption, and the tactics of the varieties of arrayed opposition forces?loyal, disloyal and semiloyal. Under certain circumstances, any of these could in itself constitute the unsolvable crisis. Thus, much as the Balewa regime had collapsed over the inequities of the inter-ethnic power structure?we may consider ethnicity an issue which, as mentioned earlier, has not vanished at all but has, following the civil war, been tempered by the hope that a constitutionally engineered device could render ethnic domination impossible, the very hope of the diarchy theorists. On the other hand, the epicenter of the crisis in the Shagari era lies in the twin effects of the economic slump in the world market, and the minimal impact of his attempted economic and political reforms, too few, too late, after an entire term of economic mismanagement and alienation of significant sectors of the agenda-setting intellectual opinion. For instance, a fall in the per barrel price of oil from $40 to $27 between 1982 and 1983 led to a fiscal crisis for the regime, and the inability of the Federal center to fund the states as constitutionally required. The consequence was that teachers' salaries and other worker wages went unpaid?resulting in strikes, demonstrations and bitter denunciations. No less disastrously, the country's international rating in financial circles eroded even as external debts added to the considerable internal ones ($22bn. by Shagari's overthrow), reaching a high of $llbn. in 1983 from a positive reserve level of $5bn. at the time General Obasanjo handed over power in 1979. Once the treasury was practically gutted, leading Nigeria into its first major debt crisis, the Second Republic's economic decline was rapid. The private sector began massive labor layoffs as machine tools could no longer be imported, leading to a 50 percent decline in industrial productivity, and a 30 percent folding of the larger companies. Unemployment climbed over 35 percent and fresh school-leavers could no longer find any employment?even as tales of</page><page sequence="13">13 sordid financial manipulations came from the financial centers of downtown Lagos. Nor could such basic staples as rice and milk be imported to make up for the disastrous agricultural shortages that had accumulated as a result of over-dependency on oil production of the past ten years. Local production fell disastrously, leading to food shortages and reports of starvation and malnutrition. Low incomes got even worse as the top 5 percent increased its control over 40 percent of the national wealth. The evidence of the massive demoralization was such that Shagari's comment that, in the final analysis, there were only two parties in Nigeria?his ruling National Party of Nigeria and the watching armed forces?proved all too poignantly self-fulfilling. Essentially, this pattern would get far worse under the successive military regimes, with kleptocracy becoming a basic modus operandus. Particularly since 1985, the prebendal, rentier characteristics of the Nigerian state reached a scandalous rate of outright pillage by a coalition of military-bureaucratic and business elites, with traditional rulers in tow. The Babangida regime in particular, with its attempts to coopt and implicate major Nigerian public figures in a web of financial inducements?"settlements" in the local slang?may go down as one of the most corrupt administrations in modern Africa.16 Foreigners have been deeply involved in the process as well.17 Biersteker has studied the tactics of the multinational corporations to evade, through using local fronts, attempts to indigenize their management.18 And the reluctance of the hugely profitable oil companies to assume environmental responsibility in the oil-producing areas, and their opposition to the limited sanctions Nigeria was threatened with in the wake of the Saro-Wiwa hanging, exemplify the boon provided by authoritarian Nigeria to foreign interests adept at operating the prebendal system.19 IV. Addressing One Unsolvable Crisis: The Consociational Option The curious unraveling of Babangida's annulment gambit in 1993 could only play itself out in 1995. Not only was his painstakingly constructed Third Republic paper jettisoned,20 but the crisis confronting his deputy, Abacha, when he seized power, was such that a resolution had to be found. A promising direction may well have been found in the adoption, by a controversial but occasionally brave</page><page sequence="14">14 constitional conference, of the idea of "rotational presidency," in which power, over a period of 30 years, would move across six geopolitical zones. A multiparty system based on proportional representation would also witness the distribution of a number of major offices across the six zones, regardless of which zone controlled power.21 This reflects an acceptance of the much-discussed consociational model which many have long believed might best suit Nigeria's ethnically-fractious federalism. Its details reflect a degree of worthwhile originality. One could argue that, given the concatenation of crises that have prevented Nigeria from managing any period of normalcy since 1948, something fresh truly needed to be tried other than the tired models of straight-out parliamentary or presidential systems. Consociational accommodation, far more than simple majority rule, is far better suited to the African reality, and its absence has certainly been the basis of many of the crises in most African states. As Christian P. Chisolm observed two decades ago, the scope of African political thought encompass an "inherent pluralism of. . . political philosophy, the constant tension between centralization and diffusion of political power, the limitation on arbitrary use of political philosophy, and the African tendency to correlate age and wisdom within the political context."22 Such states as Zaire, Sudan, Somalia, Burundi, Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, Malawi and Cote d'lvoire, could enhance their legitimacy with some attention to consociational provisos. But the structure of the political system can only be but a first step. Far more important is the conviction of political actors, their faith in the system, their grassroots fidelity to service. Indeed, given the military taste for power, unless the political class attains a level of ideological clarity about the ends and means of democratic politics, unless a congruence exists between the social context and the political institutions of the state, and these two with the norms of minimal economic efficiency and policy implementation, democratic governance during the rotational period, will be as imperilled as its Anglo American predecessors. Beyond the political elite, there is also the phenomenon of social change. Despite its many vicissitudes, the Nigeria of 1995 is a far cry</page><page sequence="15">15 from the impoverished nation of 1960. In the unfolding social structure, the twin interplay of class polarization and ethnic identification will continue to mark the experiential reality of daily life. Yet it should be clear that, increasingly, ideological considerations would be superimposed upon microsociological structures, with decisive impacts in the political arena. The argument for a consociational resolution to Nigeria's recurrent legitimacy crises is fairly clear. The rotational presidency format, despite its seeming unwieldiness, may just provide some degree of perceived security from perpetual marginalization that has been at the heart of the country's dilemmas. It is possible to foresee a five-fold outcome, in the long run?or at least a movement in that direction, some necessarily smoother than others: (1) a measure of political stability and accommodation conducive to democratic participation; (2) a new generation habituated to the norms of electoral activity, winning, losing and awaiting future possibilities in a wide range of public offices as well as perhaps a far broader middle class than the present 20 percent;23 (3) a diversified pattern of industrialization, modest but steady economic growth and a move away from chronic dependency; (4) increasing social and income equity, and the individual sense of security and fulfillment that may thereby be engendered; (5) bureaucratic efficiency and state accountability; and (6) increasing state legitimacy at a voluntaristic level. These or modest versions of such processes would always be required for any political system to survive; democracies, generally the most vulnerable of all types of political systems, seem in the Third World context, to require them even more. Conclusion We have argued in this paper that Nigeria has for almost half a century, but certainly since its independence three and half decades ago, been weighed down with three overarching forces that define the practical realities: ethnicity, power and prebendalism. To a large extent, these have become national identity-shapers. Other factors?and there are many, ranging from patterns of class crystallization and religious irredentism, to unknown but possible military cabals waiting</page><page sequence="16">16 in the wings, not to speak of the subdued traditionalist-conservative versus modernist-liberal ideological standoff across the land?are indeed germane. But whether at the level of state institutions and the civil service, the business world, academia, and even the military, the three identity-shapers are implicated in their day-to-day functioning. Yet the enormous protests and deep cynicism on the part of the larger public indicates a grass-roots rejection of the self-serving assumptions of state elites. The broad, educated middle classes would have wanted things different, more rational. The media, led by a number of muck-raking, if sometimes deeply partisan press, constantly offer an indication of alternatives to the status quo. Nigeria is a nation then, in urgent need of reformist leadership. For all reformers, however, the most sticky issue with any proposed political system remains the question of the military and its role. A future Nigerian republic, for instance, will have to confront this dilemma, even actively reach a modus vivendi to have a chance of surviving. There is a need to dissuade the military from the all-too natural inclination to become merely a ruling clique as in Togo, Chile, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq and Syria, among others; there is still something to be said for professional neutrality, as opposed to the imperious centralization so evident since 1985. A modern third world soldiery need no longer be kept holed up in the barracks. How to integrate the military into the political system without rendering them into mere partisans, remains the greatest challenge?though there need be no doubt either, that power belongs to the people, not to one institution, however organized or "disciplined." A clue to a potential solution could be seen in the reported grievances of the military at being sidetracked in decisions affecting them, of generally being marginalized, etc. It is entirely possible that ensuring that the Defense Minister is a military man, head perhaps of the joint chiefs of staff, of ensuring that the young, often idealistic colonels oversee the administration of those key agencies that provide the fulcrum for conflict?the census bureau, the service commissions? and an ombudsman that could also seek, via quiet, anonymous surveys, the opinions and attitudes of the boys in khaki on a wide range of issues, may help end this sense of marginality.</page><page sequence="17">17 Despite the international opprobium into which it ran in 1995, the need for the military to be part of the scheme of things can hardly be gainsaid. Though it does not guarantee a bankrupt regime any longevity, the military could merely reduce the spurious frequency of bankruptcies that is so typical. In this, the Fourth Republic constitution, if only conceptually, may be the harbinger of new thinking on the future of Nigeria. Notes 1. A caveat needs to be added: the murder of four Ogoni chiefs by Saro-Wiwa's followers was in itself a most gruesome act of culpable brutality. Their pro government conservative inclinations was no justification for being targeted at a public ceremony. The issue, however, was whether the internationally connected activist was really guilty to the extent alleged, and whether this merited capital punishment. Besides, the brutality shown by military pacifiers of the region, recalled a similar repression of Tiv protesters by the Balewa regime in 1962, a factor that played a role in his overthrow in 1966. Besides, the lack of a legal option of appeal, not to speak of the speed with which the Provisional Ruling Council approved his execution, implied a predisposition on the part of the authorities. 2. Consocialism refers to the model of consensus politics first described by the Swedish political scientist, Arend Lijphardt, in his Politics in Segmented Societies (1974). It refers to the practice of getting political elites to agree to a political arrangement that protects all interest groups in the system. This often involves some degree of temporary but constitutional power-sharing, rotation and other forms of accommodation. 3. The enormous outpouring of writing since Coleman's pathbreaking Nigeria: Background to Nationalism (1958), have repeatedly stressed the theme of uncertainty over Nigeria's prospects. See for instance, Kalu Ezera, Constitutional Developments in Nigeria (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960); Richard Sklar, Nigerian Political Parties: Power In An Emergent African Nation, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1963); Frederick A. O. Schwartz, Jr., Nigeria: The Tribes, the Nation or the Race?the Politics of Independence (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1965); Toyin Falola and Julius Ihonvbere, The Rise and Fall of the Second Republic, 1979-1983 (London: Zed Press, 1985); Anthony Kirk-Greene, Nigeria Since 1970: A Political and Economic Outline (New York: Holmes &amp; Meyer, 1981); and even more lately, Tunji Olagunju, Adele Jinadu and Sam Oyovbaire, Transition To Democracy (1985-1993) (Ibadan: Safari, 1993). 4. Richard Joseph's seminal insights into the character of the Nigerian state are summarized in several writings, notably, in his Democracy and Prebendal</page><page sequence="18">18 Politics in Nigeria: The Rise and Fall of the Second Republic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). He followed up with on the larger democratic ferment in "Africa: The Rebirth of Political Freedom," Journal of Democracy. 1991. 5. Tofa offers a range of contrasting views on the annulment in a wide-ranging view in Newswatch. Feb., 21, 1994. 6. For a partisan but brilliant interpretation of these events, see B. O. Nwabueze, Nigeria '93: The Political Crisis and Solutions (Ibadan: Spectrum Books, 1994), particularly the third chapter on the "Annulment of the June 12 Presidential Election." In his view, the wavering of the winning group led by Chief Abiola?in first opposing one military faction, then supporting another to take power through the Nov. 17 coup d'etat, all in the same year?was responsible for the continuation of military rule. 7. Danjuma, former Defense Minister and Chief of Army Staff, was a key architect of the crucial anti-Ironsi coup of 1966 that in part led to the civil war; he argues that the next leadership ought for the sake of justice and future stability, come from the south, specifically Igbo, the only major group that has hitherto been unable to run the Federal state for a variety of reasons. But this was half a decade before the Abiola affair in 1993 altered the Nigerian political landscape. 8. As Schwartz writes, in a passage echoed by many in years to come, there was a pronounced "distaste of most Englishmen for the educated African with whom they had contact elsewhere in Nigeria ... (as opposed to) the British fondness for the traditional aristocracy, particularly in the North." A camaraderie developed: "The British have always been fascinated by Muslims, and Muslims on horseback in glorious dress, surrounded by elaborate ceremony like the Fulani emirs, were too much to resist. Some Northern aristocrats even learned to play an excellent game of polo, thereby making communication infinitely easier;" (Schwartz, Nigeria, p. 34). 9. In a brazen act of imperial blackmail, the anxious nationalists were informed that their new nation's independence, twice delayed, would be further delayed, if more provinces were to be created. 10. Robin Luckham, The Nigerian Military: A Sociological Study (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1971), among others. 11. For example, Nwabueze makes the association. Continued military rule, avers the constitutional lawyer and a member of hapless Interim National Government that was shoved aside for Abacha, "could aptly be described as the second colonisation of the country," in Nigeria "93, pg. 47. 12. Claude Ake, Revolutionary Pressures in Africa (London, Zed Press, 1981), for instance; Folola and Ihonbere, The Rise and Fall. 13. Juan Linz's "The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes: Crisis, Breakdown and Reequilibration," in Linz and Alfred Stepan eds., The Breakdown of Democratic Regimes (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978), discusses the causes and possible remedies in cases of the inescapable series of vunsolvable crises' confronted by democratic regimes in nations where</page><page sequence="19">19 democratic politics has become habituated. Though most African countries, particularly Nigeria, may not qualify, insights abound in his model of the distinction between loyal, semi-loyal, and neutral societal institutions, and their likely reactions in times of crises. It is essentially a matter of degree since various countries, even advanced ones, informed by differing political cultures, are wont to proffer different outcomes in any case. 14. For an attempt in mapping the contours of these groupings, see Chudi Uwazurike, "Impediments to Democracy in Nigeria," in CONPO Review, 1995. This follows earlier attempts to analyze aspects of the Nigerian political process, especially in Chudi Uwazurike, "Intellectual Critics and the Nigerian Redemocratization Process: Between Cooptation and Marginalization," in TransAfrica Forum, 1991; and "Confronting Potential Breakdown: The Nigerian Redemocratization Process in Critical Perspective," Journal of Modern African Studies, 1990. 15. See Shehu Othman, "Classes, Crises and the Coup: The Demise of Shagari's Regime," African Affairs, Vol. 83, No. 33 (1984). 16. At the level of the popular media, Tell Magazine detailed a popular case against military prebendalism in its cover story of Jan. 24, 1994: "How The Military Wrecked Nigeria." The issue has been a feature of scholarly focus for years, as detailed in the compendium in Monday Ekpo ed., Bureaucratic Corruption in Sub-Saharan Africa: Towards a Search for Causes and Consequences (Washington D.C.: University Press of America, 1979). Larry Diamond, who has made a special study of the issue as a major cause of the breakdown of Nigerian democracy, has followed up with the phenomenon under the military. See among his several writings on the theme, "The Political Economy of Corruption in Nigeria" (paper presented at the 27th Annual Meeting of the African Studies Association, Los Angeles, 1984); "Nigeria Between Dictatorship and Democracy," Current History, 1987a, and "Social Change and Dictatorship in the Oil Boom," in Larry Diamond, Nigerian in Search of Democracy (London: MacMillan, 1987b). 17. A newsweekly, The News, details one such case in a cover story headlined: "The Big Oil Swindle: How A Lebanese Family Rips Nigeria Off," (26 December, 1994). 18. Thomas Biersteker's Multinationals, the State and the Control of the Nigerian Economy (Princeton,: Princeton University Press, 1987), offers an incisive account of these strategies. 19. See Moffat Ekoriko's "How Safe Are We?," Newswatch, January 6, 1996, where he looks at what might yet become, despite its profits, "the grave yard of persons and the eco-system." 20. As elaborately constructed it was, involving the energies of scores of committees, commissions, institutions and policy advisors, parties, legislators, electoral candidates and the entire political apparatus any large developing nation could muster. It proved to be a mirage as many had suspected; see Uwazurike, "Confronting Potential Breakdown." For incisive accounts of aspects of the long transition, see Diamond, "Issue in the</page><page sequence="20">20 Constitutional Design of the Third Republic in Nigeria"; the African Guardian's cover story, "The Political Bureau: An Insider's Story," July 30, 1987; A. N. Aniagolu, The Making of the 1989 Constitution of Nigeria (Ibadan: Spectrum Books, 1993); Nwabueze, Nigeria "93: The Political Crisis and Solutions; Joseph N. Garba, Fractured History: Elite Shifts and Policy Changes In Nigeria (Princeton: Sungai Books, 1994); and Olagunji and Oyovbaire, Transition To Democracy in Nigeria, among others. 21. For a detailed assessment of the merits of this see Chudi Uwazurike, "Politics and the Search for Accommodation: The Pragmatic and Cultural Context of Rotational Consociationalism in Nigeria" (Draft Paper for the Conference on "Dilemmas of Democracy in Nigeria, University of Wisconsin, November, 1995). 22. See Christian Chisolm, The Theory and Practice of African Politics (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1979), pg. 6. 23. This particular point is important. From a demographic point of view, the Nigerian age structure is over-represented by the young and ultimately politically active. Though the life span has increased from 35 in 1960 to 50 in the 1980s, the age cohort between 0-14 represented 45% in 1960 and 48% by 1981, while those 15-64 declined from 52% to 50%. Those born in 1960 will be 40 by AD 2000, those of 1980, just 20. The future will belong to this catchment segment born between 1960 and 1980. By contrast the over-65 cohort has held steady at about 2.3% (United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, Social Development Data Handbook, 1983). These figures have not altered substantially a decade later.</page></plain_text>
