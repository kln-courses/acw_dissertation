<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARNOLD TOYNBEE; CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE By H. F. KEARNEY fT*HE recent publication of the last four volumes of Arnold Toynbee's -*- "A Study of History " x has brought to an end what purports to be an undertaking on a scale far more spectacular than Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." They have been greeted by the pro fessional historians much as the Duke of Gloucester greeted the second instalment of the "Decline and Fall"?"Another damned thick square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh? Mr. Gibbon?" This marked lack of enthusiasm must appear inexplicable to the layman. At a time when modern historians are so frequently compared unfavourably with the great historians of the past and are denounced for immersing themselves in dry-as-dust specialisms, Toynbee must seem to be the only true champion of Clio and the only one fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Carlyle, Macaulay and other giants of the past, and if academic historians fail to appreciate the grandeur of Toynbee's synthesis, their narrowness must surely rank with the ignorant arrogance of the Duke of Gloucester. If this were the case, historians would stand self-condemned, creatures so blinded by the minutiae of their own special studies that they fail to observe the laws of civilisation explained by a master-historian. Their attitude would indeed be that of a plumber, who thought he has sufficient technical skill to install pipes in a building, lacks the imagination to stand back and appreciate the architectural beauty of the same building. Nevertheless, there are reasons which lie behind what might appear to be an irrational prejudice on the part of professional historians. In the first place, the historian distinguishes himself from his fellow scholars in devoting himself to the study of the past for its own sake. Sometimes his field of study is the same as that of the philosopher or the literary critic or the architect, but his aim is a different one. The philoso pher is interested in the truth as it exists to-day and though he may study Aristotle or St. Thomas he is primarily interested in their relevance to the problems of the present : the historian on the other hand tries to put back Aristotle and St. Thomas into their own " climate of opinion " and tries to understand them as if the centuries intervening had never existed. In the same way, whereas the literary critic tries to distinguish what in the 1?Arnold Toynbee, "A Study of History," vols. VII-X. 150s. net. London : Oxford University Press. 1954. 33</page><page sequence="2">34 UNIVERSITY REVIEW corpus of Shakespeare seems valuable to our generation, the historian may try to relate his work to the world of sixteenth century England. Secondly, the task of the historian is to establish relationships in the past as precisely as the evidence will allow, or in other words, to " make sense " of the evidence which remains. This definition holds true for the limited field of the local historian as for historians who by general consent are considered great?Ranke, Hal?vy, Lecky, Maitland, Stubbs, to name some of those who have helped to illuminate the history of these islands. The range and ability of each historian vary as much as the range and ability of novelists or painters, and just as an artist paints what he sees, and feels, to be significant?and this has varied from generation to generation, from La T?ne to Salvador Dali?so a historian tries to " make sense " of what he thinks to be of significance in the historical evidence. Some historians can only " make sense " of a very limited amount of material. Others copy the methods of the great masters and " see " their particular periods through the eyes of another historian; those, for example, who have fallen under the spell of Sir Lewis Namier, who influence has extended far beyond the terms of the particular problem which he set himself in the structure of politics at the accession of George III. One thing is common to all historians, however, namely, that the necessity of dealing with all the evidence available at first hand confines them to par ticular periods and particular problems. Even the most gifted have specialised. In many fields inspiration has come from the short article rather than the large book. And even works which are considered to cover a wider field than most historians care to contemplate?Pastor's History of the Popes, Lecky's History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century, Holds worth's History of English Law?all these in fact deal with specialised subjects It is against this background that Arnold Toynbee offers his " Study of History ". The sweep of an Acton pales into insignificance with the task that Toynbee has undertaken, to bring intelligibility to the history of the civilised human race. All that historians understand by the term " history " is left far behind, though some of the specialised studies that they have produced are indeed used by Toynbee. Now in this task he deserves sympathy. No Christian can believe that history is meaningless. He believes that God entered the world at a particular point in time and that the Church of God exists in time. But the Christian " theology of history," to use Gilson's phrase, makes contact at very few points with what we understand to be the ordinary world of the historian. All we know of the past is what we can get from the evidence which remains, and, if, in the present, even the significance of our own lives eludes us, how much more presumptuous is it to find an ultimate meaning for the events of ages which have left only a few fragments of the life which it once lived. The part played by the Irish famine in the scheme</page><page sequence="3">ARNOLD TOYNBEE: CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE 35 of Providence may have been to strengthen Catholicism in England, the United States and Australia. But on the evidence available the historian could not draw such conclusions. He must confine himself to the art of the possible, namely, to understand how the Famine could occur, not why it did -?in the ultimate sense. Hence his answer is framed not in terms of Divine Providence, though he believes that to be the case, but in terms of over-population, the potato blight and the inactivity of the English government. The common world of historical evidence is remote from the world of the Christian " theology of history." The coming of the Normans to Ireland, the Statute of Kilkenny, the plantation in Ulster, the Williamite confiscation, the Act of Union, Gladstone's land legislation, the second Home Rule Bill?it is impossible to fit these mundane happenings into a general theology of history. The historian does not attempt to do so and does not think that he is neglecting his duty by not doing so. If he is a Christian he realises that he has before him only a minute part of the evidence, which it is difficult enough to make sense of, without the additional task of trying to fit his limited and often changing conclusions into a grand theological sweep. What historians call humility in the face of the evidence, Toynbee regards as complete and utter irresponsibility. For him, Bossuet in the late 17th century was the last historian in the western European tradition who did not fail in his duty. Toynbee denounces as " the late Modern Western Act of Apostasy " and as " antinomianism ", what he regards as the " unintelligibly chaotic congeries of brute facts " assembled by present day historians. His criticism of modern historians, however, falls com pletely beside the point. They are indeed much less dogmatic than their nineteenth century predecessors, and this, so far from being a defect, is a major virtue. Buckle or Comte or Marx had no doubt that they had discovered the true laws which lie behind history, whereas modern his torians, so far from removing the mystery from human history have restored it. In this, their attitude is more truly religious than Toynbee, whose attitude represents a retrogression to the over-confidence of the last century and whose scheme of history is a throwback to the enlightenment of the eighteenth century, though with the optimism which accompanied it. He is indeed a kind of H. G. Wells produced by the Oxford School of Greats. In his first six volumes Toynbee expressed the view that the unit of historical study is the " civilisation ", by which he means a type of society which is subject to change. Primitive society is not subject to change and therefore is not a legitimate object for historical study. From the study of such civilisations as have existed?and unfortunately they are few?it is possible to deduce the laws which lie behind their rise and fall. Toynbee finds the cause of change in the response made by a society to the challenge D</page><page sequence="4">36 UNIVERSITY REVIEW either of " environment " or a " dominant minority," which may include "militarists," "administrators" or "philosophers." In the face of an unprecedented challenge, a society either changes its way of life successfully or else it goes under. This is the theme of "A Study of History "?the way in which previous civilisations and our own have responded, with or without success, to the challenges, spiritual and material, which in the nature of things they have been unable to avoid. The first criticism which an historian may make of all this is that Toynbee is not primarily interested in the past for its own sake. His intention is really to discover laws which will help us to escape from what he would regard as the predicament of the modern world. He sees us as confronted with a challenge much in the same way as Christian was in Bunyan's " Pilgrim's Progress." What response to the challenge is Christian going to make? Is he going to look this way and that as if he would run, yet stand still because he cannot tell which way to go? Or will he begin to run?and run on crying " Life! Life! Eternal Life!?with his eye set on a shining light and his feet bound for a distant wicket-gate. Every civilisation except our own has broken down, but we cannot accept a fatalist solution and despair: we must try to learn from the past. Much as one may sympathise as a Christian, with this viewpoint, it can hardly be called historical. The historian is interested in the past for its own sake as a humane study and for him the cardinal error is to attempt to read the past in terms of the present. In the nineteenth century the past was seen in terms of " Progress," culminating in the present; but while we may criticise and pity the errors of Victorian optimism, it is no improvement to fall into an excess of pessimism to-day and commit the same mistake in a different kind of way. The historian does not deny that the world to-day may be in a sorry mess: St. Augustine thought so, so did Machiavelli, so did Marx. ^?ie world as a place to live in has always left something to be desired/ The philosopher and the theologian, the preacher and the publicist may well find much to criticise in contem porary manners and the historian in his spare time may play the Jeremiah. But history as such (and under this heading prehistory, pace some archaeo logists, may be included) is interested in the study of the past for its own sake; if history has any raison d'?tre at all it is here. This then is the main objection to " A Study of History "?that it is not history. This fundamental criticism of the underlying attitude of "A Study of History " may be reinforced by an examination of the generalisations which Toynbee makes about the past. A sympathetic reader of Toynbee might put the issue in this way?even if "A Study of History" as a whole is primarily an unhistorical work in the traditions of Comte and Buckle, Spengler and H. G. Wells, and even if Toynbee is primarily interested in the future of the modern world, it is still important to see how much of</page><page sequence="5">ARNOLD TOYNBEE: CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE 37 his work will stand scrutiny by historical standards. Can, for example, his generalisations be compared with those of Karl Marx? Marx, after all, was not interested in the past for its own sake and yet there can be few historians who have not been influenced, in some way, by the economic interpretation of history. The view may perhaps be held, therefore, that like Marx, Toynbee draws attention to hitherto neglected aspects of human history, and perhaps in spite of himself, his work has an historical value. This argument has a superficial attraction which will not stand examination. The value of the Marxist interpretation of history lay in the stimulus it gave to historians, working in their own fields, to take account of economic factors which they had hitherto ignored: a new dimension, so to say, was added to the historian's world. By comparison with this, Toynbee's view of history is a retrogression. The assumption which lies behind his phrase " challenge and response " is anthropomorphic. It con veys the impression that a particular society is possessed of a will of its own and a freedom of choice in a particular situation. Challenge and response may be valid in the life of each individual, but it is excessive simplification when applied to the life of a society or an institution. This emerges clearly in Toynbee's treatment of the history of the Papacy, which he uses as an example of the way in which complete victory contained the seeds of ultimate defeat. According to Toynbee the Papacy took a wrong turning under Gregory VII by attempting to fight the Emperor with his own weapons. The decision of Hildebrand in 1075 brought victory then but it contained defeat for the future when the Papacy found itself involved more and more in the world. Disaster followed disaster in the paganisation of the Vatican during the Italian Renaissance and the dis ruption of the Catholic Church through the Reformation; the indecisive but ferocious struggle inaugurated by the Counter-Reformation, the spiritual nullity of the Papacy in the eighteenth century and its active anti-liberalism in the nineteenth?all this traced back to 1075 when the Pope took the crucial decision conditioning all that followed. In short, Toynbee sees the history of the Papacy as a Greek tragedy in which excessive pride born of success leads to downfall. Now Toynbee may be entitled to take this view of Papal history? and it is a mild one by comparison with those of Protestant divines of the last century?but it can hardly be called history. The whole tone of the chapter is couched in emotional terms and recalls to the reader's mind the poetic quality of The Dynasts rather than the sober pages of the Cambridge Medieval and Modern Histories. It can scarcely be pretended that " Chal lenge and Response" in this particular instance would throw much light upon the particular situation which confronted the Papacy during the Council of Trent or Pius IX during the crucial years 1846-8. And yet it is by its power to illuminate particular historical situations that a generalisa tion must be judged. The Marxist interpretation, even a Christian must</page><page sequence="6">38 UNIVERSITY REVIEW admit, did draw attention to neglected economic factors and hence led to greater historical precision. By comparison, Toynbee's generalisation is valueless. It leaves existing historical views unchanged : in fact Toynbee is content to take over, historical generalisations, such as the " Renaissance" or "The Enlightenment" which have ben subject to sharp criticism in recent years. " Challenge and Response " is in short too vague a concept to be useful in illuminating the complexities of historical situations in the past. It is also a concept which may lead to a simple-minded misreading of the past. One of the examples which Toynbee uses to illustrate the effect which the removal of a stimulus can have upon a society is the decline of Spain. He attributes the decline of Spain to the fact that Spanish energy gave out as soon as the challenge offered by the Moors had been success fully overcome. The truth, however, would appear to be otherwise. Spain played a comparatively minor role in the medieval world precisely because the crusade against the Moors made such demands upon the energy of the Spanish people. It is when the Moors had been successfully overcome after the conquest of Granada that the Golden Age of Spain can be said to have begun, which lasted for over a century. Cortez, St. Ignatius, St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa, Cervantes?these and many others are figures of sixteenth century Spain when the Moorish challenge had long lost its full force. Toynbee notes that the final discomfiture of Spain over seas coincided with the extirpation of the Moriscoes by massacre, expulsion or forcible conversion. But here again the average historian is reluctant to approach the decline of Spain in so simpliste a fashion. The Price Rise, the long struggle first in the Netherlands and France and then in the Thirty Years' War, Spanish decline in the field of commerce, these and other factors should be taken into consideration. Even then, the decline of Spain was far from permanent, as the eighteenth century showed, and it was the Industrial Revolution rather than any decision taken by Charles V in the sixteenth century that led to the eclipse of Spain and Austria in the nineteenth. The same dramatic simplification is also applied to Irish history. Toynbee describes what he calls " the abortive Far Western civilisation " in grandiloquent terms (vol. vii, p. 322). " The prudent Celtic and Teutonic rearguards of the European barbarism held themselves in reserve and sought to beget new civilisations of their own in place of Hellenism . . . These high ambitions brought first the Western Celts and then the far Northern Teutons into conflict with the Catholic Church, since in Western Europe, there was not room for several separate civilisations." The tragedy was begun by the conflict between " the libertarianism of Ireland and the authoritarianism of Rome ' : the first act was closed by the Synod of Whitby, the second act saw the Irish reaction to the ordeal of the Scan dinavian Volkerwandering: the third act was opened by Henry IFs</page><page sequence="7">ARNOLD TOYNBEE: CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE 39 expedition to Ireland on the authority of a papal bull (p. 331). This series of challenges proved excessive in their severity and explained why this Far Western Christian civilisation was abortive. It seems that the essential feature of Toynbee's higher synthesis is to describe these centuries in terms of drama, the tension of which derives from a struggle between two cultures. The same dramatic element which simplified the complex history of the Papacy, reduces to superficial order the complexities of early Irish history and Toynbee's vague prose prevents any attempt on the part of the reader to get to grips with the evidence. For a historical account we may turn to the precise prose of F. M. Stenton (Anglo Saxon England, p. 125), in which it is pointed out that the Roman victory of 663 did not cause a general departure of Irish clergy from England and " many features of Irish Christianity such as its asceticism and its insistence on penitential discipline, profoundly affected the later develop ment of the English Church." Toynbee's whole tendency is to " write up " current text book know ledge, but to what purpose it is difficult to say. He takes over, for example, uncritically an outdated view of John Scotus Erigena, whom he describes as "the giant of the Carolingian Renaissance, whose like was not seen again in Western Christendom until the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century "?in short as a rationalist in the style of Valla. Gilson has recently pointed out the superficiality of this view, which rests upon a fundamental misunderstanding of Erigena's thought, and, for that matter, of medieval philosophy in general. Erigena may have been an intellectual giant of his time, but his like was to be seen again from the twefth century onwards. This chapter on the " abortive Far Western Christian civilisation " may be taken not unfairly as a specimen of a " Study of History "?an inflated version of current, sometimes outdated, text book knowledge. (One might also quarrel with his adjective " abortive," applied to a civilisation which produced the Book^of^KelTs, the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch. The "classical moment" in any civilisation rarely lasts long. Even without the Danish invasion Irish civilisation probably would have suffered a decline, but it had already produced superlative works of art). Toynbee's method, however, is revealed at its most bizarre in his analysis of law and freedom in history (vol. IX, p.297). One of the laws of nature he discovers is the rhythm generated by two tendencies of unequal strength. He finds a conspicuous rendering of this rhythm in the history of North America. Geography intended North America to be unified politically under some one of the national states that were at odds in the old world. History, however, was more capricious. Toynbee personifies history in an odd way "History's passing tribute," "History was evidently bent on defying," " History's anti-unitarian caprice," " History kept a watchful eye open," " Clio made sure," " History led the people of the United States," " the ultimate partition of North America was ' History's dark horse ' "?</page><page sequence="8">40 UNIVERSITY REVIEW these are the phrases used in what is clearly a most naive way of looking at history. Applied to Ireland, they would appear even more simpliste. In the last four volumes, which have just been published, the vagueness and confusion of the whole work have become, if anything, more obvious. There is a greater reliance upon the use of extended similes, which disguise the absence of proof or convincing argument, while the peculiar jargon which Toynbee has invented has become even more prominent. I quote two examples of Toynbee's style to illustrate the way in which the metaphor governs his thought, not vice versa " Every living human society, like every living individual human being is all the time emitting waves of spiritual radiation which travel outwards through space and onwards through Time till they impinge on other societies and other individuals whom they happen to strike." This extremely vague statement is then used and developed like a theme in a sonata, but what it means exactly is never made clear. Another example follows within a few pages. " If we venture, at our peril, to illuminate an obscure subject of inquiry with the borrowed light of a simile, we may perhaps not inaptly liken an integral culture to a flint that has been compacted by the age-long pressure of. enormous forces and the disintegration of a cul ture to the work of a demonic flint knapper who is master of the knack of splitting one flake after another off the core of the stone on which he is exercising his uncanny sleight of hand. In the knapping of a cul ture the outermost and most easily detachable flake is the economic side of Human Life which may be defined as the field in which Man exerts his power over Man?Human Nature. The next flake and also the next most easy to detach, is the political side of human life, which may be defined as the field in which man exerts his power over his fellow human beings. When these two superficial layers have been split off, a cultural core remains; and this core may be defined in terms of Life as the heart of a culture where the soul participates in God's creative work by grappling with his first and last adversary the self ... ! Here again Toynbee develops the metaphor and lulls the reader into a state of uncritical hypnosis. We stop enquiring what it all means and allow ourselves to be carried away. Clearly however " A Study of History " in its last four volumes moves increasingly from what we understand as history. Historical facts may bestrew its pages in plenty, but they are now used for an ultra-historical purpose more and more openly. The main change of emphasis in these volumes concerns the place of religion in Toynbee's scheme of things. He now regards " universal churches " not as a " social cancer " but as " the bread of social as well as spiritual life." He is now willing to allow a much more important r?le to religion in history. But by religion, he does not</page><page sequence="9">ARNOLD TOYNBEE: CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE 41 mean any particular religion. Those Christians who would welcome Toynbee into the Christian fold would do well to ask what he means by Christianity. All great religions for him are variations on the one theme. "The churches embodying the higher religions are diverse approximate projections on earth of one and the same civitas dei." The revelation which Christians regard as unique merges into a general background of Tammuz, Adonis, Osiris and Balder. Toynbee himself seems to look forward to some vague mixture of religions as a basis for the future. He may be entitled to do this, but it can hardly be regarded as emerging from a scientific "study of history" and the academic historian may well point to a connection between Toynbee's vague classifications of historical situations, which they insist are unique, and his vague treatment of world religions. " A Study of History " concludes with a litany, which must seem a piece of mad blasphemy to the Christian reader. It is however a suitable conclusion for a work which has used the facts of history to support an increasingly wayward thesis. For all its claim to be a scientific work " A Study of History " is no more so than H. G. Wells' " An Outline of History" (which Toynbee describes as a magnificent intellectual achievement). As the work goes on its humourless way, the prose becomes vaguer and more highly flavoured. But it was already capable of this description of the Yorkshire West Riding as early as the third volume (p. 61): " In their out ward aspect, the ' dark satanic ^nills ' seemed a fitting match for the weak, grey landscape; and at the sam? time, the tour de force of these monstrous works of man, erected in defiance of the wilderness, had all the moral incongruity of an abomination of desolation standing in the place where it ought not. In this pullutating, throbbing, squalid life in a forbidding landscape, there was something portentously natural." The style is the man, and here we are with the revivalist preacher in his pulpit, far from the historian's study.</page></plain_text>
