<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Relative Chronology of the Vedic Hynns. -By MAU- RICE BLOOMFIELD, Professor in Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. LET us say that the number of metrical stanzas in the Vedic literature, aside from variant forms of the same stanza, amounts to 20,000 more or less. The subject-matter of these stanzas varies very greatly ; there is considerable difference of style, grammar, and lexicon; the metres, though in the main the same, are handled with varying degrees of adhesion to what seem to be the metri- cal laws; the stanzas as collected into the traditional hymns of the redactors are by no means always engaged with the same theme within one and the same hymn; and a lively tradition reports a considerable number of ancient sages (rqis) as the authors of a great many of these stanzas. It is not possible that one author should have composed these stanzas by himself during his life- time, nor is it possible that a coterie or school of authors of a comparatively brief period represent both the alpha and the omega of authorship in these fields. The nature of Vedic chronology-if we may speak of any at all- precludes any attempt to fix the date of individual hymns, or the different types and styles of hymns, either by calendar or dynasty. Practically no such attempts have been made; instead, the relative age of the hymns and stanzas has called out much speculation and assumption, as well as painstaking investigation. Entire collections of hymns, single hymns, parts of hymns, and single stanzas have been characterized, with degrees of confidence varying from almost whispered suspicion to clarion-voiced con- fidence, as very early, quite early, early ; and late, quite late, very late. There has been unanimity, as, e. g., in the case of the tenth book of the RV.: this everybody describes as late. There has been the greatest possible disagreement, as, e. g., in the case of the eighth book of the RV.: this has been shown to be the earliest as well as the latest of the so-called family-books of that collection. The habits of mind which have given rise to these judgments are not hard to describe. They are based in the first instance upon an entirely justifiable impression. In the midst of the</page><page sequence="2">Vol. xxi.] Relative Chronology of the Vedic Ihymns. 43 hymnal tradition the Rig-Veda looms up as the largest, the most important collection; without doubt a large proportion of its material belongs to the earliest recorded literary efforts of the Hindus; no less certainly the period of the redaction of this material is fully as early, if not earlier, than the period of the redaction of the other collections. This is shown very clearly by those stanzas of the RV. which are reproduced with more or less variation in AV., SV., and YV. In the large majority of cases these variant readings are as good or better in RV. than in the other collections. In the large majority of cases, we say, and this ensures the RV. its position. But not in all cases: no amount of haggling will deprive the other collections of their occasional better readings. This fact cannot be brushed aside lightly : if the Sdma-Veda has, say, two dozen better readings which cannot be explained as later aesthetic, opportunist, or shrewdly learned improvements of the Sdmavedins; if these better readings are really, let us say, prehistoric, then we must assume a current of independent Slmavedic tradition, however scantily its waters may trickle. And so on with, the AV. and YV. tradition. We must not neglect to make here a sharp distinction between redaction and authorship: a collection made at a later date may, of course, include material composed at an earlier time. Within the RV. itself there has been room for the work of a second impression, scarcely less justifiable than the first. The impression that oper- ates here is that of a certain extraneousness of parts of the col- lection. By processes of paring and trimming the 1,000 hymns of the RV. with their 10,000 stanzas are reduced to a lesser number in order to get at the inner kernel, an older and more gen- uine RV. The tenth book, forming one end, and a very large one at that, contains a great deal of material, especially of the Atharvanic sort, which is undoubtedly foreign to the main theme of the RV., the worship of the forces of nature, and their anthro- pomorphic precipitates, the personal gods (Indra, Agni, etc.). But why must all such matter really be of more recent date, along with the same substance in the AV. ? The answer that is made to this question will engage us later on. The tenth book contains also a great deal of non-Atharvanic matter, among other things the wedding-charms and funeral-hymns of the Veda. We cannot well imagine Vedic Hinduism without, e. g., the little Yama-Sarhhita, as we may call it, RV. X. lo-18. Yet this has not been spared entirely the charge of relative lateness. Here is where the difference between time of redaction and time of com-</page><page sequence="3">44 M; Bloomfield, [1900. position is particularly important. We may well believe that the hymns of book X. were assembled and added to the rest at a later time, without prejudicing our belief in the extreme antiquity of some or even all its hymns. Think of it, can there have been a time in which Yama, the son of Vivasvant (Avestan Yima, the son of Vivanhvant), his heaven, and his Cerberus dogs, were so much in abeyance in the minds of the Vedic folk that they had nothing to say about them; only by a later recrudescence of these fancies were they finally embalmed into those stanzas that are on the whole the most interesting in early Vedic religion ! And again think of it, the vast stretch of magic practices, good and evil, which extend from the RV. through the ritual, the law- books, the Epic, down to the Dagakumdracarita and later, accord- ing to the same kind of assumption, also failed to obtain any literary expression at a time when the so-called family books of the RV. had been composed and gathered ! Silently, without charm or prayer, or, at best, only with scant prose formulas, we are asked to believe, were carried on all the endless practices that really reach the heart of Hindu life: medical practices, and practices which secure long life; the practices connected with the lives of kings, priests, women, village community ; marriage, birth, pupilhood, householdership; death, funeral, and worship of the Fathers. Other parts of books, single hymns, and, last but not least, groups of stanzas or single stanzas, usually at the end of hymns, are cast out, almost always under the rule of the impression that they do not fit in, either with the arrangement, or the subject- matter of that main theme of the book, the worship of Agni, Indra, Sftryn, the Aqvins, etc. At least the following caution ought to be observed: before throwing out we ought to know the reason why the redactors placed these extra materials where we find them. The redactors were reasonable men : what is to us antiquity was for them at least relatively the living present. The characterization of stanzas as ' secondary appendages,' 'meaningless rubbish,' and the like, is invariably another way of saying that our knowledge has come to an end. Even now the profounder study of many a hymn, especially in relation to the practicalities of Vedic life and worship, has vindicated a large number of so-called appendages, and shown them to be a very real part of the main body of the hymn. E. g., RV. i. 126, a hymn in praise of a generous patron of priests (ddnastuti), winds up with two frankly obscene stanzas. No greater contrast imaginable: at</page><page sequence="4">Vol. Xxi.] Relative Chronology of the Vedic Hymns. 45 first sight the conclusion is irresistible that these two odd and very strange stanzas lay about loose and were by pure accident attached to this particular hymn. When, however, we again find, at the end of RV. viii. 1, an obscene stanza (34), preceded by a ddnastuti, the organicity, so to say, of the connection becomes highly probable. We are carried into that strange med- ley of 'gift-praises,' didactic stanzas, riddles, and obscenities, known as the kuntdpa (AV. xx. 127-136; 9sfikh. 9r. xii. 14ff.; and elsewhere). Very popular as these materials obviously are, they are imbedded deeply in the liturgy of many of the great Vedic sacrifices. I have suggested recently that the bestowal of gifts upon the priests, resulting in the 'gift-praises,' was followed by all sorts of hilarities which finally bridged over the gap that there is between the truly solemn parts of these sacrifices to what for lack of a better term we may call a kind of liturgic 'sau- knzeipe.' That is, if the theory be correct, the rich gifts to the priests lead in many instances to gormandizing and drunkenness, and these again were followed-the practice is not entirely unknown in our day-by shallow witticisms, by obscene talk, and worse.1 Anyhow, the light-hearted rejection of RV. i. 126. 6, 7, and viii. 1. 34 is out of the question; on the contrary, these stanzas strengthen the rapidly growing conviction that the RV., as we have it, in common with the other Vedas, is a liturgic collection-a large mantra-pdtha, so to say, for a more primitive chain of sacrifices and practices than that which is recorded in the Brdhmanas and Sfitras. Bergaigne has shown that the appar- ently independent character, in form and subject-matter, of many final stanzas in the RV. is organic and practical, not hap-hazard and redactorial; e. g., the so-called paridhdayd-stanzas; the lengthening of final stanzas; and the conclusions in tristubh- metre of certain hymns in jagati-metre.' Cf. also my remarks on RV. x. 16. 13, 14, and vii. 103. 10, respectively, AJPh. xi. 343 ff.; JAOS. xvii. 178. When, finally, these processes have laid bare the supposed inner kernel of the RV., the latter attracts attention first of all by its monotony. The picture of ancient Hindu life that could be derived from it is of the haziest sort. Excepting that it includes the practices connected with the pressure and sacrifice of the 'See Bloomfield, The Atharva-Veda, p. 100 (G6rundriss der Indo- Arischen Philologie). 2 Journal Asiatique, 1888, vol. xiii, pp. 153-165.</page><page sequence="5">46 M. Bloomfield, [1900. soma-drink it is purely mythological; prevailingly it alludes to real life only in simile and metaphor, though, of course, the ordi- nary benefits that men crave are asked of the gods in very gen- eral terms. Inasmuch as this material is of paramount impor- tance in the greater Vedic ritual (prduta) with three fires and many priests, as laid down in the Brdhmanas and 9rduta-Sfttras, we may conveniently designate these hymns and their diction as ritualistic or hieratic. On the other hand, because the excluded parts of the RV. are in the main within the sphere of the Atharvan and the house-practices, let us designate their hymns and diction as Atharvanic or popular (demotic). Indeed the two terms hieratic and popular will serve our purpose best. At this point what is in the first place a mere impression pro- duced by the facts of external arrangement, by the fact that the hieratic and popular materials do not blend any better than oil and water, is reinforced by certain metrical and linguistic considera- tions. The chief metrical consideration is Oldenberg's theory of the anustubh. The original Atharvanic anustubh stanzas, i. e., those that do not reproduce with more or less variation the RV. stanzas that deal with the anthropomorphic nature-gods, differ from these RV. anustubhs on the one hand, and from the Epic and Buddh- istic gloka on the other. In the strictly Rig-Vedic anustublis the first pada of each hemistich regularly ends in a diiambus or second paeon (e - v a); in the Epic and Buddhistic 91oka, still more regularly, in a first epitrite or antispast (v - - i). On the other hand, each Atharvanic (and Grhya) hemistich permits these as well as all other possible feet of four syllables ( v 2 2 u): see, e. g., AV. i. 1; i. 2; i. 7; i. 8; v. 19; and xii. 4. The Athar- vanic and Grhya anustubh may be designated as the popular anustubh in distinction from the hieratic anustubh of the soma- hymns in the RV.: a hymn like RV. x. 85 (the wedding-stanzas) is, of course, in popular anustubh. But if we consider the quantitative freedom of the eight- syllable line of the Younger Avesta, there is reason to assume that the popular (freer) anustubh is by construction and chron- ology earlier than the better regulated hieratic (somic) anustubh. The theory that the development of the popular foot took place from v - v? (hieratic) through u U v u (popular), to v - - _ (Epic and Buddhistic) is on its face improbable; in the light of all Hindu metrical development the change from the regulated type v - !:U to the less free types that must be expressed by</page><page sequence="6">Vol. xxi.] Relative Chronology of the TVedic Hymns. 47 0 0 0 0 is, to say the least, very difficult. Instead, we may assume that the Aryan free octosyllabic lines, grouped into two hemistichs of sixteen syllables, developed (on slight prehistoric iambic tendencies) the iambic cadence at the end of each hemi- stich, and continued so in the popular poetry until the beginnings of the Epic and Buddhist 9loka. At the same time a more exquisite treatment at the hands of the hieratic poets developed the Rig-Vedic (somic) anustubh on a parallel line, by repeating the final cadence of each hemistich before the caesura in its middle, i. e., at the end of each pada. Linguistically and stylistically the popular hymns are found to be related more closely than the hieratic hymns to that dialect or dialects which are at the base of the Brahmanas, Stitras, and the later vehicles of literary expression in general, the classical San- skrit, of course, not excepted. Because the popular hymns favor certain phonetic habits, grammatical forms, and lexical materials of the prose parts of the Veda and the later Sanskrit literature in general, therefore the popular hymns are later. But, lo and behold, these discussions seem to have been carried on without proper regard to comparative grammar and etymology: almost all the linguistic forms that are looked upon as indications of late date are in reality as old, still more often older than the entire history of the Aryan language in India. The latest essay on this subject, that of E. V. Arnold, in this Journal, vol. xviii., 203 ff. is as con- spicuously deficient in this matter as are all its predecessors. Once, and only once, in the course of the long, elaborate, and diligent article, whose statistics will always remain of value, the author seems to have a vision of the broader canvass upon which his grammatical figures do in reality stand. It is in connection with the ' late,' classical infinitive in -trn. ' Throughout the whole Vedic period the classical form -trnm is rare, though it becomes more common in AV. It is noticeable that the form in -tun- also occurs in Latin, and is therefore presumably primitive; yet it is entirely absent from the earliest hymns of the RV. This fact must be a warning against drawing conclusions as to date from isolated phenomena, however striking they may at first sight appear' (1. c., p. 310). Very true, but why not apply the same very sound observation to the ' late' dual in -au. This ending -au appears in astalit = Goth. ahtau: it is not only a form that existed in Indo-European times, but is sufficiently old and pre- historic to have played a part in the 'glottogonic' events that</page><page sequence="7">48 M. Bloomfield, [1900. brought about the derivative ordinals, Latin octdv-us, Greek oySo -oq, whose v (F) is surely identical with the u of astau. Indeed, Professor Meringer' has shown that the dual endings -au and -a are two sarhdhi-forms of the same ending, their original distribution being -au before vowels, a before consonants, with secondary (' euphonic') loss of u. Genetically, therefore au preceded -a. Similar very obvious considerations show that the instrumental plural of a-stems in -ais and -ebhis are both pre- historic. Sk. vrkais = Avest. vehrkdis = Gr. XV'Kotq = Lith. vil- kais; and Vedic vikebhis = Avest. vehrkdebis. Originally the ending -bhis seems indeed in this class of nouns to have been sec- ondary to -dis, having been borrowed either from the conso- nantal noun-stems, or from the pronominal declensions. A momnent's reflection suffices also to establish the prehistoric char- acter of both the nominative plurals in -as and -dsas belonging to the a-stems. Of more isolated morphological cases 'late' hvayami is espe- cially instructive. If there is any form which belongs organic- ally to the 'popular' and not to 'hieratic' language it is hva- ydmi. Yet it is prehistoric,= Avest. zbayemi. That the type karati, kurzu (cf. Ved. tarute) is structurally very old is now the accepted view of comparative grammar.2 Or let us consider the 'late' stem panthdn- in relation to 'early' panthdi-. Not till the AV. do the ordinary Sk. forms paintha-nah and pdnthdnam turn up, and yet they are pre-Vedic, as is shown by Avestan pahtdnenz. The truth is that the type panthan-am is just as old as, if not older than, the type panth&amp;(i)-m. It is useless to mul- tiply the cases in which comparative grammar and etymology shows that the 'late' popular forms are in reality prehistoric: s it would be easy to show that the phonetics, morphology and lexicon of the popular language contribute just as much to the stock of common Indo-European, or commion Indo-Iranian mate- rials, as do the corresponding data of the hieratic language. The question is therefore largely one of dialect, style or subject- matter: this is the primary point of view from which the language of the popular hymns must be compared with the hieratic hymns.

Here is the bad logic: the hieratic language is certainly old; the popular language is not hieratic: therefore it is late (black is a color; red is not black; therefore red is not a color). A necessary preliminary to a more successful study of the relative chronology of the Vedic hymns is their separation into classes; at least two classes, hieratic and popular, but probably more. For example, the Sdma-hymns (pragatha) of the eighth and first books (hymns 1-50) are by no means to be compared directly with the strictly Rig-books, for subject-matter cannot help influencing style as well as choice of words and grammar. As a preacher in the pulpit may glide in and out of biblical (archaic) diction in the course of his sermon: at one moment he may use the language of Isaiah or the Psalms, at another the latest and most forceful popular speech of the day; as the poetry of a given period may range from dithyramb to doggerel, so it is with the language of the Vedic hymns. Attempts to establish the relative chronology of the Vedic hymns will necessarily always remain difficult and subjective, but the problem will be relieved of a great deal of its perplexity by deal- ing with the hymns according to their subject-matter, and by holding up each grammatical and lexical fact to the light that shines from the related languages. Within each class of hymns there is still room for observations on relative chronology. If we find a hymn devoted, say, to Indra's exploits in connection with Vrtra and the other demons, using persistently the verbs karomi, hvayarni, or the dual in -a and the instrumental in -ais, we may assign to it a relatively late period. Bat the same gram- matical phenomena, say in a medicinal charm are absolutely otiose, because they are prehistoric and have been the normal unaffected forms of the popular language from the very begin- ning of Hindu tradition.
