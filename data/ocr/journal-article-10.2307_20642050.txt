Bryer and Nancy P. VanArsdale, eds. "Who is this Gatsby anyhow?" Answering that question, voiced by one of the book s characters, is fundamental to teaching E Scott Fitzgerald s The Great Gatsby. Although there is no simple answer, classroom analysis of this classic American novel can lead to a rich exploration of the colorful yet contradictory period Fitzgerald dubbed the Jazz Age.

The first issue explores sound as a medium for interrogating identity, for improvising multiculturalism, and for approaching subjectivity as a technological extension; it includes studies of the history of sound, of silence, psychoanalysis, gesture, and the sound archive. The second issue centers, in various ways, on voice: its recording and mechanical reproduction, echo, radio, silent cinema, sound poetry, television, music theatre, spectrality. ANTIGONE: a special issue, September 2008. Marking a return to tragedy that is taking place in literary and critical theory, this issue approaches the figure and the play, Antigone, through essays on finitude, community, law, and ethics in Sophocles's play, as well as through translation and work on fiction.
