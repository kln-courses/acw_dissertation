Pricopio, Harold J. Mertz, Joseph S. Balser, and William M. Chkoreff Current Engineering and Manufacturing Services Staff General Motors Corp. ABSTRACT Side impact tests were conducted on the EUROSID and SID to assess their biofidelity compared to the response requirements of the International Standards Organization. The body regions evaluated were the head, neck, thorax, shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis. Test condi- tions and data normalization procedures are outlined in the report. Data plots are given which compare the impact response of each dummy to the ISO requirements. The EUROSID gave humanlike responses for most tests involving padded surface impacts, but its responses were not humanlike for rigid surface impacts. Overall, the EUROSID responses were more humanlike than the responses of the SID. PROPOSED REGULATION ON SIDE IMPACT PERFOR- MANCE and the introduction of the EUROSID have prompted studies of th√© biofidelity of both the EUROSID and SID. A series of tests [1 - 6]* to assess the biofidel- ity of side impact dummies has been identified by the International Standards Organization (ISO). These test conditions were selected by the experts from available data on side impacts involving human volunteers or cadav- ers. Lateral cadaver drop test results were chosen to assess the responses of the head, thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Lateral sled test results were selected to assess the neck, thorax and pelvis. Pendulum impact tests were used to specify requirements for the shoulder, thorax and pelvis responses. The conditions of the various tests, as well as the required measurements, filtering and data normalization procedures are outlined in this report and detailed in the ISO reports. The ISO reports also give the human volunteer and cadaver data upon which the impact 'Numbers in brackets designate References at end of paper. response requirements were based. The purpose of this report is to compare the impact responses of the EUROSID and SID to performance requirements of the ISO. The EUROSID and SID were subjected to all of the ISO tests conditions, except the decelerator sled test for the neck bending response and the 3 meter drop test for the pelvic response. Graphs which compare the EUROSID and SID responses to the ISO time-varying response requirements are given. Peak values compared to the ISO ranges are given in tabular form for both dummies. The dummy tests described in this report were con- ducted at the General Motors Safety Development Labo- ratory. Similar dummy tests were also conducted on one or both dummies at other research facilities. TNO - Road Vehicles Research Institute subjected the EUROSID to some of the ISO test conditions [7], Tests for the Com- mittee of Common Market Automobile Constructors (CCMC) were conducted by the Association Peugeot S.A./Renault (APR) on both the EUROSID and SID [8], Tests on both dummies were conducted by the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) [9]. Differences between the GM test results and the results of other investigators are noted. TEST PROCEDURE This section will give a brief summary of the test conditions for the head, neck, thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis of the EUROSID and the SID. A record of the required measurements and their filter classes can be found in Table A of the Appendix for the EUROSID and Table B of the Appendix for the SID. HEAD TEST PROCEDURES - Two test conditions were used to evaluate the dummy's head [1], Both tests used a quick-release mechanism to drop the dummy's head from heights of 200 mm and 1200 mm, respectively. The head was oriented at 35 degrees to the horizontal in the first test condition and at 10 degrees in the second. 671</page><page sequence="2">The impact surface was rigid in test condition 1 and was covered with a 5 mm thick rubber padding in test condtion 2. NECK TEST PROCEDURES - Two of the three lat- eral neck bending test conditions [2] were used to evalu- ate the neck of the dummies. In the first test condition, an upright rigid chair was attached sideways to the sled, and the dummy was restrained to the seat by a harness at the shoulders and the pelvis. The dummy's hip and shoul- der were placed against a vertical side wall that was rigidly attached to the seat. The midsagittal plane of the dummy was vertical and the anterior-posterior axis of the head was horizontal. See Figure 1 . The dummy was then subjected to a deceleration between 6.9 and 7.3 G and a change in velocity betwen 6.8 and 7.0 m/s. High speed film coverage was used to determine head translation and rotation. The second test condition was not conducted. The third test condition used the same conditions as the first except a deceleration pulse between 10 and 14 G and a change in velocity of 22 +/- 0.5 km/h (6.1 +/- 0.1 m/s) were used. THORAX TEST PROCEDURES - Three types of thoracic impact tests were used to evaluate the thorax of the EUROSID and SID [3]. The first test condition con- sisted of a series of whole dummy drop tests from 1 meter onto a rigid surface and 2 meters onto a padded surface consisting of a 140 x 140 x 430 mm block of open cell urethane foam, called APR padding. With its midsag- ittal plane horizontal, the dummy was suspended above two instrumented impact surfaces which measured loads at the thorax and pelvis. In the EUROSID tests, the arms were rotated forward and upward and tied to the head to prevent interaction of the arms with the impact surface. The legs and the hips of the dummy were tied with rope and the body was leveled before each drop. See Figure 2. For these drop tests the EUROSID's rubber suit was omitted to be able to better view the ribs. The SID's outer skin was worn because it was considered to be an important part of the dummy's response. The second test condition for the thoracic impacts was a series of HYGE sled tests. A seat with an instru- mented side panel was attached to an impact sled, side- ways to the direction of travel. The side panel had a thoracic and a pelvic impact surface, each instrumented with four load cells. The surface of the seat and footrest were covered with Teflon to allow the dummy to translate relative to the seat without rotating. The dummy was placed a sufficient distance away from the impact sur- face to allow the sled to be stopped before impact. The hands of the EUROSID were placed on its lap. The upper arm was at the dummy's side with the elbow slightly forward of the back rest. The knees were set 190 mm apart. Rigid impact tests were conducted at 24 km/h and 32 km/h. The padded tests, which had APR padding attached to the impact plates, were run at 32 km/h. The outer coverings of both the SID and the EUROSID were worn during these tests. The third test condition for the thorax was a series of pendulum impacts. The dummy was seated in an upright position on a flat surface, without back support. Its legs were positioned horizontally in front of the dummy. The arm on the impacted side of the EUROSID was fastened behind the head. A 23.4 kg rigid pendulum Impactor with a 150 mm diameter face was used to impact the thorax at 4.3 m/s. The center line of the impactor was centered on the rib structure. The outer coverings of both the SID and the EUROSID were worn during these tests. FIGURE 1 . Lateral Neck Bending Sled Tests [2]. 672 a. EUROSID Positioning for the 7 G Test. b.

SID Positioning for the 2 Meter Padded Drop.</page><page sequence="4">SHOULDER TEST PROCEDURE - A series of pendu- lum impacts were run to evaluate the response of the dummy's shoulder [4]. The dummy was seated upright without back support on a flat, rigid surface. A 23.4 kg rigid pendulum impactor with a 1 50 mm diameter flat face was used to strike the shoulder at 4.5 m/s. The center line of the impactor was aligned with the center of the shoulder joint. The jacket of the EUROSID was used in all tests except test number D1 1335. For the SID, all tests were run with its outer skin intact. ABDOMEN TEST PROCEDURE - To evaluate the response of the abdominal region of the dummy, a series of drop tests was performed [5]. The dummy was dropped freely from 1 and 2 meters onto a rigid armrest. The armrest protruded 3.9 cm above the surrounding surface and was instrumented with two load cells. The dummy was positioned so that the armrest was centered on its abdominal regbn. For the EUROSID, that meant center- ing the abdominal insert on the armrest, which was easily done. However, on the SID, the abdomen is not clearly defined and our judgement was to center the armrest on the region between the top edge of the iliac crest of the pelvis and the lower edge of the ribs. See Figure 3. The jacket of the EUROSID was not worn during these tests to better monitor the impact location. However, on the SID, the outer covering was worn to keep the abdominal insert in place. High speed camera coverage was used to determine abdominal penetration. PELVIS TEST PROCEDURES - Three different types of pelvic impacts were used to evaluate the response of the SID and EUROSID [6]. The first test condition con- sisted of a series of tests using a 1 7.3 kg rigid pendulum impacting the pelvis at velocities between 6 m/s and 1 0 m/s. The dummy was seated upright on a stack of pad- ding and the center line of the impactor was aligned with the dummy's H-point. A rigid spherical segment impactor face was used (see Figure 4) but was smaller than that specified by Reference 6, in order to avoid impacting the platform the dummy was seated on. The second test condition was a series of full body drop tests. These tests were run in conjunction with the 1 meter rigid and 2 meter padded thoracic drop tests. In addition, a 0.5 meter drop onto a rigid surface was con- ducted. The 3 meter drop test specified in Reference 6 was not conducted. The third test condition used to evaluate the pelvis consisted of the HYGE sled tests that were used in the thorax evaluation. The pelvic impact surfaces were rigid for the 24 km/h test, rigid for one 32 km/h test, and pad- ded for the other 32 km/h test. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS EUROSID and SID measurements required in the ISO tests are listed respectively in Tables A and B of the Appendix. The filter class, recorded peak value, normaliz- ing factors, normalized peak and the ISO requirement for each measurement are also given. Normalization proce- dures were specified for the thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis impacts [3 - 6]. In all cases, the size of the dummy was assumed to be identical to the standard subject and the stiffness ratio, Rƒ∑, is unity. For each test, the effective mass, representing the portion of the total dummy mass involved in that impact, was calcu- a.

Rear View of the Positioning for the Pelvic Pendulum Impact Tests [6], lated by the ISO procedures. Effective masses for the thorax, shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis impact tests are given in Table 1 . The mass ratio, Rm, was determined by dividing the effective mass of the standard subject by the effective mass of the dummy. The normalizing factor for each measurement was calculated from Rƒ∑ and Rm according to the procedures given in the ISO reports. The normalized peak, obtained by multiplying the measured peak value by the appropriate response ratio, corrects for the mass coupling of the test device which may be differ- ent from the mass coupling of the standard cadaver subject [10]. A variation on the APR rating scale [8] is used in this report. Normalized peak values which meet their corre- sponding ISO requirements are rated "A". Peak values within one corridor width above or below the requirement are rated "B" and all other responses are rated "C". The impact biofidelity of the EUROSID and SID for all tests conducted are compared by this scheme in Table 2. HEAD DROP TESTS - Figures 5 and 6 show the peak resultant head accelerations of the EUROSID and SID, respectively, compared to the impact response require- ments of the ISO [1 ]. The EUROSID response to the 200 mm rigid drop is within one corridor width above the response corridor. The response of the EUROSID to the 1 200 mm padded drop is farther above the response corri- dor than in the rigid drop test. The response of the SID to both drop tests lies farther above the response corridors than the EUROSID. The biofidelity score of the EUROSID head subjected to the 200 mm rigid drop test is a "B". A score of "C" is given for the EUROSID response to the 1200 mm padded drop and to the SID response to both head drop conditions It may be possible to bring the EUROSID response to the FIGURE 5.

The 1200 mm padded drop is a severe test condition with HIC values ranging from 1200 to 1500 in the APR cadaver study [1 1], Appropriate dummy response for impact severities exceeding currently accepted HIC limits may not be as important as for the lower severity impact. NECK LATERAL 7 G SLED TEST - Two lateral sled tests were conducted on the EUROSID and the SID. The results are given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Displace- ments of the upper spine (T 1 ) and head center of gravity of the EUROSID were too large compared to the ISO corridors [2].

The vertical head acceleration, however, was nearly twice as high as the ISO requirement. The maximum angles of flexion and twist were completely dissimilar from the volunteer data. Also the time of maximum head excursion occurred slightly too early with the EUROSID. The horizontal displacement of the SID upper spine and vertical displacement of the head center of gravity exceed the ISO response corridor by a wide margin. The horizontal displacement of the head center of gravity is only slightly below the requirement. Accelerations of the SID upper spine and head exceed their corresponding response corridors. The maximum angle of flexion is slightly above the ISO corridor, but the SID experienced virtually no twist. Maximum head excursion occurred well before the required time of maximum excursion. The biofidelity ratings for the EUROSID and SID necks are given in Table 2. The overall response of the EUROSID neck is slightly more humanlike than the SID, when compared to the ISO requirements for the 7 G lateral sled test. Also note that the requirement on the horizontal displacement of T1 is a shoulder response requirement which neither dummy meets. Both dummy shoulder structures are too soft compared to the human volunteer data with the SID shoulder being twice as soft as the EUROSID. NECK LATERAL 12 G SLED TEST - The EUROSID and SID were each subjected to one 1 2 G sled test. Test results are given in Table 5 for the EUROSID and Table 6 for the SID. All of the EUROSID responses, except the maximum twist angle, exceeded the ISO corridors [2] by a large margin. As in the lower level sled test, the EURO- SID experienced virtually no twist. The maximum lateral acceleration of the SID head met the ISO requirement. All other responses, except the twist angle, were far above their respective corridors. The SID experienced no head twist. Biofidelity ratings for the EUROSID and SID are given for the 12 G lateral sled test in Table 2. The responses of both necks were poor under this test condition. 676</page><page sequence="7">Table 2.

The average of these effec- tive masses is 25% lower than the 38 kg of the standard cadaver subject. Effective masses which vary signifi- cantly from the standard are an indication that the mass coupling in the dummy tests is considerably different from the mass coupling in the cadaver tests. Differences in the mass coupling are caused by improper mass distri- bution and coupling in the dummy, differences in the way the tests were conducted, or a combination of both. Inspection of the dummy thorax shows too much mass concentrated in the moveable rib structure. The large difference in the effective thoracic masses from the two tests conducted on the EUROSID indicates poor repeat- ability of the 1 meter rigid drop test. Figures 7 and 8 show the response of the EUROSID to the 1 meter drop onto a rigid surface. A considerable difference in response between the EUROSID and the cadaver can be concluded from the shape and amplitude of the impacted surface force. The peak rib deflections are also well in excess of the ISO response corridor. Table 1 gives the effective thoracic masses from the EUROSID 2 meter drops onto a padded surface. The Table 5.

Also note that the EUROSID effective masses from the repeat tests are close in value. These effective thoracic masses indicate that the APR padding used in the 2 meter drop test is able to mask the deficiencies of the EUROSID thorax and enhance test repeatability. As a result, the normalizing factors for both tests, given in Table A, are very close to 1 .0. Figure 9 shows the impact surface force versus time plot for both tests which are completely within the ISO response corridor. The peak rib deflection of the middle rib is within the ISO response corridor for both tests, as shown in Figure 10. Also, the average of the deflections of all three ribs falls within the ISO response corridor for each test. The EUROSID thorax performs well compared to the ISO requirements for the 2 meter padded drop test. The effective thoracic masses from the SID 1 meter rigid drop tests are 46.4 kg and 47.0 kg, as given in Table 1 . The average effective mass is 23% greater than the 38.0 kg effective mass of the standard cadaver subject. For the reasons given above, this indicates poor thoracic mass distribution of the dummy and/or poor duplication of the test conditions between the cadaver and dummy. The large effective masses from the SID tests yield normaliz- 678</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 7.

Normalized Peak Rib Deflection and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the EUROSID 1 m Drop onto a Rigid Surface. ing factors which are well below 1 .0, as given in Table B. Although the peak impacted surface force of the SID is too high, the general shape and duration of the impacted surface force versus time curve resemble the ISO corri- dor, as shown in Figure 1 1 . A comparison of Figures 1 1 and 7 indicates that the normalized response of the SID thorax to the 1 meter rigid drop is more biofidelic than the EUROSID. The peak rib deflection of the SID, shown in Figure 12, is also closer to the ISO response corridor than the deflections of the EUROSID, shown in Figure 8. Table 1 gives the effective thoracic masses of 53.0 kg and 55.8 kg from the SID 2 meter drops onto a padded surface. Unlike the EUROSID padded drops, the APR padding did not mask the mass coupling deficiencies of this test condition. The large effective thoracic masses yielded normalizing factors which are considerably below FIGURE 9.

Normalized Peak Rib Deflection and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the EUROSID 2 m Drop onto a Padded Surface. 1 .0, as given in Table B. The shape, amplitude and dura- tion of the normalized impact surface force plot, shown in Figure 13, match the ISO response corridor well. There is a time shift, caused by the SID arm foam, which moves both curves out of the ISO corridor. The normalized peak rib deflections, shown in Figure 14, are near the lower boundary of the response corridor. The normalized responses of the SID and EUROSID to the 2 meter padded drop are very similar. Table 2 indicates that the biofidelity of the SID to the rigid thorax drop is slightly better than the EUROSID. Both dummies meet the ISO requirements for the padded thorax drop.

Normalized Impact Surface Force and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the SID 1 m Drop onto a Rigid Surface. FIGURE 12. Normalized Peak Rib Deflection and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the SID 1 m Drop onto a Rigid Surface. Figures 15, 16 and 1 7 for the 6.8 m/s rigid wall, 8.9 m/s rigid wall, and 8.9 m/s padded wall impacts, respectively. The peak loads for the rigid wall tests are significantly above the upper boundary of the ISO response corridor. The EUROSID response to the padded wall impact lies within the ISO requirement. The effective thoracic masses, given in Table 1 , were 30.1 kg and 27.1 kg for the 6.8 m/s rigid wall impact, 29.9 kg and 33.0 kg for the 8.9 m/s rigid wall impact, and 30.7 kg for the 8.9 m/s padded wall impact. While these are low compared to the 38.0 kg effective thoracic mass of the standard subject, the normalizing factors for force, given in Table A, are reason- ably close to 1 .0. This Indicates that only small correc- tions in the dummy data are needed compared to the cadaver results. Figures 18,19 and 20 show the SID responses to the FIGURE 13. Normalized Impact Surface Force and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the SID 2 m Drop onto a Padded Surface. FIGURE 14. Normalized Peak Rib Deflection and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the SID 2 m Drop onto a Padded Surface. 6.8 m/s rigid wall, 8.9 m/s rigid wall, and 8.9 m/s padded wall sled tests, respectively. The normalized impact surface force versus time histories of the rigid wall impacts have amplitudes which are twice as high as the upper boundary of the ISO corridors. The time durations of the forces are about half of the duration of the ISO response corridors. The amplitude of the padded impact surface force is slightly too large, but the time duration is acceptable. The SID effective thoracic masses for these tests, given in Table 1 , were 36.4 kg, 36.8 kg and 35.4 kg, respectively, for the 6.8 m/s rigid impact, 8.9 m/s rigid impact, and 8.9 m/s padded impact. These show a reason- able approximation of the effective thoracic mass of the standard cadaver subject which was 38.0 kg. The biofidelity scores for the thorax sled tests are given in Table 2.

The EUROSID thorax meets the padded sled requirement and the SID nearly meets the requirement. THORAX PENDULUM IMPACTS - The ISO require- ments [3] for the pendulum impact to the thorax consist of response corridors for the pendulum acceleration and upper spine lateral acceleration time histories. The EUROSID normalized pendulum acceleration, shown in Figure 21 , and normalized upper spine lateral acceleration, shown in Figure 22, are unrepresentative of the ISO response corridors in both peak accelerations and time durations. The effective thoracic masses, given in Table 1 , were 34.3 kg and 35.6 kg, which compare reasonably well to 32.7 kg for the standard cadaver subject. The normalizing factors, shown in Table A, are very near 1 .0. FIGURE 21 . Normalized Pendulum Acceleration and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the 23.4 kg Pendulum Impact at 4.3 m/s to the EUROSID thorax FIGURE 22. Normalized Upper Spine Lateral Acceleration and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the 23.4 kg Pendulum Impact at 4.3 m/s to the EUROSID Thorax. Responses of the SID to the thorax pendulum impact are shown in Figures 23 and 24. Both the normalized pendulum and upper spine lateral accelerations show a slower initial onset, due to the SID's arm foam. The peak accelerations of both the pendulum and the upper spine are too high compared to the ISO response corridors. The effective thoracic masses for the SID subjected to the thorax pendulum impact were 34.9 kg, 33.7 kg, and 34.4 kg, as given in Table 1 . These values are less than 5% greater than the effective mass of the standard subject, indicat- ing good mass coupling for this test condition. Table B shows the normalizing factors, which are close to 1 .0. Table 2 shows the biofidelity ratings of both dummies for the thorax pendulum impact. This is a rigid impact condition and neither dummy meets the ISO impact response requirements, although both dummies have FIGURE 23.

SHOULDER PENDULUM IMPACTS - The ISO requirement for the shoulder pendulum impact consists of a response corridor on the pendulum impact force versus time plot and a requirement for the peak shoulder deflec- tion. Shoulder deflections were not recorded for these tests. The pendulum impact forces of the EUROSID and the ISO response requirement are shown in Figure 25. The EUROSID response lies almost entirely within the response corridor, with the peak force slightly above the upper boundary. Effective shoulder masses from the EUROSID tests, given in Table 1 , are 1 5.7 kg, 1 6.5 kg and 16.1 kg. The effective shoulder masses from these tests are low compared to the 20.5 kg effective mass of the standard cadaver subject. For this simple pendulum impact, it is doubtful that the difference in effective masses between the EUROSID and the standard cadaver subject can be attributed to poor test repeatability. Poor mass coupling of the EUROSID shoulder structure is more likely the reason for the low effective shoulder masses. Due to the low effective shoulder masses, the EUROSID forces need to be increased by 10 to 15% as indicated by the force normalizing factors given in Table A of the Appendix. The shoulder pendulum impact force from the SID tests are shown with the ISO response corridor in Figure 26. The SID response shows a slower initial onset, caused by the poor biofidelity of the SID arm foam, followed by a sharper rise to the peak force. Peak forces for the two shoulder impact tests conducted on the SID are well above the upper boundary of the ISO corridor. The SID shoulder does not have the biofidelity of the EUROSID shoulder, when the response of each is compared to the ISO response corridor. Effective shoulder masses of 1 7.3 kg and 17.5 kg for the SID shoulder impacts are 15% below FIGURE 25. Normalized Impact Force and ISO Response Corridor [4] for the 23 kg Pendulum Impact at 4.5 m/s to the EUROSID Shoulder. the effective mass of the standard cadaver subject. This results in a force correction of less than 10%, as indicated by the force normalizing factors given in Table B of the Appendix. Table 2 indicates that both dummies fail to meet the response requirements of the ISO. The normalized response of the EUROSID provides a better approxima- tion of the ISO corridor than does the SID. ABDOMEN DROP TESTS - The ISO response requirements for the 1 and 2 meter drops onto a rigid armrest consist of a time history corridor on the armrest force curve and ranges on the peak accelerations of the lower spine and lower rib on the impacted side [5]. Figure 27 shows the normalized armrest forces from the EURO- SID 1 meter drop compared to the ISO response corridor. The peak armrest forces for the tests conducted are near the upper boundary of the corridor. The load onset rates from the EUROSID tests are too steep, but the overall durations are within the ISO corridor. Normalized acceler- ation of the EUROSID lower spine is shown in Figure 28. The peak acceleration is well in excess of the ISO range. The peak lower rib acceleration is not given. The ISO response requirement for the lower rib acceleration was based on accelerations resulting from the cadaver ribs striking the armrest. The EUROSID ribs struck the torso plate rather than the armrest, making the ISO range an inappropriate requirement for the dummy. The peak armrest force from the EUROSID 2 meter drop is compared to the ISO corridor [5] in Figure 29. The peak force is far above the ISO corridor. Figure 30 shows the peak lower spine acceleration slightly above the ISO range. Again, the near side rib acceleration was not given since it is inappropriate for the dummy, as described above. Table 1 gives the effective abdominal masses from the abdominal drop tests conducted on the EUROSID and FIGURE 26.

The average effective abdominal masses from the EUROSID tests were 17.3 kg and 16.1 kg for the 1 and 2 meter drops, respectively. These values compare reason- ably well to the 1 6.4 kg effective mass of the standard cadaver subject. Dummy mass distribution and coupling, and test repeatability do not appear to be deficiencies of the EUROSID subjected to the abdominal drop tests. Responses of the SID to the 1 meter drop are com- pared to the ISO corridors in Figures 31 and 32 for the armrest force and lower spine acceleration, respectively. The effect of the SID arm foam is shown in the long duration of the armrest toads in Figure 31 . The peak tower spine acceleration of the SID is above the ISO require- ment for the 1 meter drop, as shown in Figure 32. The normalized near side lower rib acceleration was not given since the SID arm foam contacted the armrest. The FIGURE 29. Normalized Armrest Force and ISO Response Corridor [5] for the EUROSID 2 m Drop onto a 3.9 cm Rigid Armrest. FIGURE 30. Normalized Lower Spine Acceleration and ISO Range [5] for the Peak Normalized Acceleration for the EUROSID 2 m Drop onto a 3.9 cm Rigid Armrest. cadaver's arms did not contact the armrest, and hence comparison of the dummy response to the cadaver response is inappropriate for this measurement. Figures 33 and 34 give the armrest force and lower spine acceleration, respectively, of the SID for the 2 meter drop onto a rigid armrest. The ISO response requirements are shown in the same figures. As in the SID response to the 1 meter drop, the padding effects of the arm foam are shown in the longer duration of the armrest force. The peak tower spine accelerations are slightly below the lower limit of the ISO range. As described above, the normalized near side tower rib accel- erations are not an appropriate measure for this impact condition and are not given here. Initial tests run on the SID located the armrest in the flat region between the bottom of the arm foam and the 684</page><page sequence="15">FIGURE 31 .

These tests had very poor repeatability with effective abdominal masses varying between 8.2 and 19.1 kg. A second test series was conducted with the armrest centered between the bottom of the lower rib and the top of the pelvis casting. Table 1 gives the effective abdominal masses from the second series of tests conducted on the SID. The effec- tive masses from this series were much more repeatable with average values of 8.3 kg and 9.0 kg for the 1 and 2 meter drops, respectively. These effective masses are far too low compared to the 1 6.4 kg effective mass of the standard cadaver subject. The SID mass distribution, coupling of the abdomen and the repeatability of the abdominal drop test are shortcomings with this dummy. Biofidelity ratings for the abdominal drop tests are given for the EUROSID and SID in Table 2. Based solely FIGURE 33. Normalized Armrest Force and ISO Response Corridor [5] for the SID 2 m Drop onto a 3.9 cm Rigid Armrest. FIGURE 34. Normalized Lower Spine Acceleration and ISO Range [5] for the Peak Normalized Acceleration for the SID 2 m Drop onto a 3.9 cm Rigid Armrest. on the peak forces and accelerations, the biofidelity rating of both dummies is nearly identical. However, as described above, the EUROSID abdomen provides a more biofidelic armrest load in the 1 meter drop. The 2 meter drop appears to have bottomed-out the EUROSID abdomi- nal structure resulting in very high armrest load. This impact condition exceeds the acceptable interaction for abdominal protection as measured by the EUROSID abdominal switches. The need for biofidelity at this impact severity is probably not necessary for assessing reasonable abdominal protection systems. PELVIS PENDULUM IMPACTS - The ISO response requirement [6] for the pelvis pendulum impact consists of a corridor on a plot of the peak pendulum force versus the impact velocity. The response of the EUROSID to 685</page><page sequence="16">two pendulum velocities is shown in Figure 35. The peak pendulum forces exceed the upper limit of the corridor. Effective pelvic masses from the tests vary from 15.1 kg to 15.4 kg, as given in Table 1 . This compares well to 14.5 kg for the standard subject. The resulting normalizing factors are given in Table A. The biofidelity score for the EUROSID in the rigid pendulum impact is poor, as indi- cated in Table 2. FIGURE 35 ISO Response Corridor [6] and Normalized Peak Force vs. Impact Velocity for the EUROSID Pelvis Struck by a 1 7.3 kg Rigid Pendulum. Responses of the SID to the pelvic pendulum impact test are shown in Figure 36. The SID pelvic responses are farther above the ISO requirement than the responses of the EUROSID. Table 1 gives the effective pelvic masses from the pendulum impacts to the SID. The average effective pelvic mass from the SID tests was 16.4 kg, which is too high compared to the 14.5 kg effective mass FIGURE 36. ISO Response Corridor {6] and Normalized Peak Force vs. Impact Velocity for the SID Pelvis Struck by a 17.3 kg Rigid Pendulum. of the standard cadaver subject. The normalizing factors for the SID pelvis pendulum impacts, given in Table B, are not too far from 1 .0. Table 2 gives a poor biofidelity rating from the SID pelvis subjected to the rigid pendulum impact. PELVIS DROP TESTS - Resultant pelvic accelera- tions from the EUROSID 0.5 meter rigid, 1 meter rigid and 2 meter padded drops are shown respectively in Figures 37, 38 and 39. The ISO ranges [6] for the peak pelvic accelerations are shown in each figure. The ISO upper limit for the peak acceleration is slightly exceeded in the 0.5 meter drop. The upper limit is exceeded by a large margin in the 1 meter drop. The peak accelerations from the 2 meter padded drops lie within the ISO range. The biofidelity ratings assigned to the EUROSID pelvic drop tests are given in Table 2. These ratings indicate poor responses to the rigid drop conditions and an acceptable response to the 2 meter padded drop test. Figures 40, 41 and 42 show the SID pelvic responses to the 0.5 meter rigid, 1 meter rigid and 2 meter padded drops, respectively. The average peak accelerations for the rigid drops are slightly above their corresponding ISO ranges. The average peak acceleration of the SID padded drop lies within the ISO range. The biofidelity ratings for the SID subjected to the pelvic drop conditions are identi- cal to those of the EUROSID, as shown in Table 2. PELVIS SLED TESTS - The ISO requirements for the pelvic sled tests consist of ranges for the peak normal- ized pelvic plate force and the peak normalized lateral pelvic acceleration [6]. The responses of the EUROSID and SID are given in Table 7 for the 24 km/h rigid, 32 km/h rigid and 32 km/h padded tests. Table 7 also gives the ISO requirements. Table 2 gives the biofidelity scores for both dummies subjected to the pelvic sled tests. The peak values of both dummies exceed the required ranges by large margins in the rigid impacts resulting in "C" biofidel- ity scores. For the padded tests, the peak values of both dummies are below the required ranges and within the "B" biofidelity range. Most of the SID responses were slightly closer to requirements for all three test conditions. Table 7.

Tables 8 and 9 give the biofidelity scores for the EUROSID and SID, respectively, assigned to the results reported by these investigators. HEAD DROP TESTS - TNO conducted the head drop tests on the EUROSID [7] and APR conducted the tests on both dummies [8]. JAMA conducted only the 200 mm drop on both the EUROSID and SID heads [9]. Biofidelity scores assigned to TNO, APR and JAMA test results are given in Tables 8 and 9 for the EUROSID and SID, respec- tively. Neither dummy meets the ISO head drop require- ments, but the EUROSID response is closer to the requirements. NECK LATERAL 7 G SLED TEST - Table 8 gives a comparison of the biofidelity ratings assigned to the EUROSID responses from the 7 G lateral sled tests conducted by GM, APR [8] and JAMA [9]. TNO did not subject the EUROSID to this test condition. Overall, the response of the EUROSID meets or nearly meets the ISO requirement for the lateral acceleration of the upper spine (T1 ). An overall poor response is noted for the angle of twist and the vertical displacement of the head center of gravity with respect to T1 . The combined biofidelity scores of GM, APR and JAMA indicate that all other responses fall within one corridor width of the ISO requirement. Biofidelity ratings, given in Table 9, were assigned for the neck lateral 7 G sled tests conducted on the SID by GM, APR [8] and JAMA [9]. The APR biofidelity scores indicate a poorer performance of the SID neck compared to the GM and JAMA biofidelity scores. The overall response of the SID neck to this test condition is less biofidelic than the response of the EUROSID neck. NECK LATERAL 12 G SLED TEST - Summaries of the biofidelity ratings of the test results from the APR [8] and GM studies are given in Tables 8 and 9 for the EUROSID and SID, respectively. Neither TNO nor JAMA conducted the 12 G sled test. In general, the results obtained by APR on both dummies are closer to the ISO requirements than were the results of the GM study. Both dummy necks have a poor response to this test condition. THORAX DROP TESTS - The thorax drop tests were conducted on the EUROSID by TNO [7], APR [8] and JAMA [9]. The SID was subjected to the thorax drop tests by APR and JAMA. Data reported by APR and JAMA for the 1 meter rigid and 2 meter padded drops were filtered at channel frequency class 1000, rather than class 180 as required by the ISO. Tables 8 and 9 give the biofidelity scores assigned to the test results from GM, TNO, APR and JAMA. None of the investigators' results with either dummy meet the ISO requirements for the 1 meter rigid drop. Both the EUROSID and SID received good biofidelity scores for the 2 meter padded drop. THORAX SLED TESTS - The EUROSID was sub- jected to the rigid and padded sled tests by TNO [7] and JAMA [9], Test results reported from the TNO and JAMA studies are nearly identical to the results of the GM study, as shown in Table 8. JAMA also conducted the thorax sled tests on the SID. The JAMA results are similar to the GM results, as shown in Table 9. Neither dummy performed well in the rigid sled tests. The EURO- SID response in the padded test was within or near the ISO response requirements. THORAX PENDULUM IMPACTS - The ISO thorax pendulum tests were conducted by TNO [7] on the EURO- SID and by APR [8] and JAMA [9] on both dummies. The GM, TNO and JAMA studies were conducted with the dummies' jackets in place. The APR pendulum impacts were conducted without the EUROSID jacket and without the SID arm foam and jacket. The peak pendulum acceler- ations were nearly identical for the GM tests conducted with the EUROSID jacket and the APR tests conducted without the jacket, as shown in Figure 43. A comparison of the upper spine accelerations with and without the EUROSID jacket, in Figure 44, show a doubling of the peak acceleration when the jacket is removed. Figures 45 and 46 show the pendulum and upper spine lateral acceler- ations, respectively, for the SID tested with and without the arm foam and jacket. The presence of the SID arm foam reduces the peaks and increases the time durations of both the pendulum and upper spine accelerations. The biofidelity scores for the EUROSID and SID subjected to the thorax pendulum impact are given in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. Overall, neither dummy meets the ISO requirements for this test condition. 25-T : : ; ' Legend A ‚ñ† GM (FIR) ^ 20 ; f" ' ; ‚ñ° APRjFƒºRjJ ¬ß : ¬° ' La ! 5 is- { ' /-/t'A N i en i y : / ' N y en . m i y ' : i/ / o V/ io 20 50 &lt;0 50 TIME - (ms) FIGURE 43.

SHOULDER PENDULUM IMPACTS - Shoulder pen- dulum impact tests were conducted on the EUROSID by TNO [7], APR [8] and JAMA [9] conducted the shoulder impact tests on both the EUROSID and SID. Biofidelity ratings for the EUROSID and SID shoulders are given in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. The peak impact forces from all of the EUROSID tests lie within one corridor width above the ISO requirement. The investigators studying the shoulder response of the SID all reported peak impact forces occurring consistently above the ISO corridor. The EUROSID shoulder response is closer to meeting the ISO response corridor.

GM and APR Normalized Upper Spine Lateral Acceleration and ISO Response Corridor [3] for the 23.4 kg Pendulum Impact at 4.3 m/s to the SID Thorax (APR Data Redrawn from Reference [8]). The TNO study used only the EUROSID. APR and JAMA used both dummies, but the effective masses and normal- izing factors reported for the SID by APR were incorrect and will not be used for comparison. Test results from the TNO, APR and JAMA studies were available only at channel frequency class 600, rather than class 1 80 as prescribed by the ISO. Another difference was the arm- rest heights of 3.9 cm for the GM study and 4.1 cm for the other studies. The normalized cadaver data [6] were not influenced by armrest heights varying between 3.1 and 5.1 cm, however, the EUROSID abdominal switches detect penetration of 4.0 cm or more [13]. The TNO and GM armrest loads for the EUROSID 1 meter drops are given in Figure 47. The APR and JAMA results were similar to the TNO results. Some of the difference in peak armrest loads is attributed to the filter classes used. The armrest force may also vary depending on the precise location of the armrest within the abdominal region and the amount of armrest penetra- tion. The peak lower spine accelerations from the 1 meter drops conducted at the various test facilities were all more than one corridor width above the ISO upper limit. As a result, "C" biofidelity scores were assigned for the EUROSID 1 meter drop, as given in Table 8. Armrest loads from the TNO and GM 2 meter drops of the EUROSID are shown in Figure 48. The results from the APR and JAMA 2 meter drops are similar to the TNO results. Most of the difference in peak loads between the GM study and the others can be attributed to the different filter classes used. Peak lower spine accelera- tions reported by all investigators were above the ISO upper limit, as indicated by the biofidelity scores in Table 8. Armrest loads and lower spine accelerations of the SID 1 and 2 meter drops are strongly dependent on the position of the armrest and whether or not the arm foam and jacket are used.

The results given in References 7 and 9 do not reflect the August, 1 988 revisions to the filter class and normalizing procedure [6] for this test condition. The revised proce- dure specifies a mass ratio equal to 76 kg divided by the total body mass of the dummy. Acceleration normalizing factors of 1 .0 and 1 .01 3 are obtained for the 76 kg EURO- SID and 78 kg SID, respectively. Corrected peaks for the normalized pelvic accelerations are given and compared to the results of the GM results in Table 1 0. Neither dummy meets all of the pelvic drop requirements, as shown in Table 10.

PELVIS SLED TESTS - TNO [7, 12] conducted the lateral sled tests on the EUROSID and JAMA [9] con- ducted the tests on both dummies. FIR filtered test results were not available from TNO and JAMA. In addi- tion, the same revision to the normalization procedure as outlined for the pelvic drop tests was not reflected in the results given in References 7 and 9. Table 1 1 gives the corrected peak impact surface forces and lateral pelvic accelerations from the TNO tests compared to the corre- sponding peak values from the GM study. The original peak values measured in the JAMA study were not avail- able and could not be calculated from the information given in Reference 9. As indicated in Table 1 1 , the EURO- SID is close to meeting all the requirements for the pad- ded test. Neither dummy meets the rigid test require- ments, as shown in the biofidelity ratings in Tables 8 and 9. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A series of tests was identified by the ISO to assess the biofidelity of side impact dummies. Impact response requirements were set to measure the lateral impact performance of the head, neck, thorax, shoulder, abdomen, and pelvis. The most recent versions of the EUROSID and SID were subjected to the ISO test conditions by GM and others. In general, there was good agreement in the test results provided by all of the investigators. Tables 8 and 9 give a biofidelity rating to the EUROSID and SID, respectively, for each impact response requirement. The biofidelity ratings indicate that neither dummy meets all of the ISO impact response requirements. Overall, the impact response of the EUROSID is more biofidelic than that of the SID. Specific conclusions are given by body region below. 1 . Performance of the EUROSID head in the 200 mm rigid drop test is close to the ISO requirement and may be within the corridor if a silicone grease is applied between the skull casting and head skin. The 1200 mm padded drop is a severe test and conformance to this requirement may not be neces- sary. The SID head response was not humanlike in either test condition. 2. Neither the EUROSID nor the SID neck responds in a humanlike manner. 3. Neither dummy has a humanlike thoracic response to rigid impacts. The padding masks the deficien- cies of the dummy response sufficiently for the EUROSID to meet all and the SID to nearly meet all of the padded requirements. 4. The EUROSID shoulder response nearly meets the ISO response requirement for the shoulder pendu- lum impact. The SID shoulder exhibits no biofidelity in the shoulder pendulum impact. The neck perfor- mance requirements also place constraints on the shoulder response. The EUROSID shoulder is closer to meeting these requirements. 5. The response of both dummies to the abdominal drop tests were not consistent between the differ- ent test facilities. The results of this study indi- cate that the SID arm foam introduces a consider- able phase shift in the response data. Table 1 1 .
