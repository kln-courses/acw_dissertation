<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Douglas Carlson The Uses of Adversity: American Nature Writing in Despair * American nature writing, from its beginnings in the work of Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and Mary Austin, remained incidental and unnamed until the middle of the twentieth century. By that time, a burgeoning national interest in the natural world that had begun with the "conservation president," Theodore Roosevelt, had grown in the years of increased leisure after World War II. This interest broadened with the enormous popularity of Roger Tory Petersons field guides, which made the rudiments of field biology available to the nonscientific community. And it deepened as books such as Aldo Leopolds Sand County Almanac (1949) and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) raised public awareness of environmental issues. Over the past twenty- five years, the number of books has increased dramati- cally, most frequently as collections of first-person essays- and generally within the "belletristic" tradition, where observation and description of the natural world was the central concern, and the relationship of culture to nature was a secondary theme at the very least. With the emergence of such writers as Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, John McPhee, Wallace Stegner, and Ann Zwinger, nature writing had become, by the century's end, at least a strain of American literature, if not a genre. A wide diversity of approaches has evolved, ranging from the highly personal and postromantic to a more science-based, cause-and-effect analysis. In fact, these two extremes might often appear within the same book. Yet regardless of the author s * An essay- review of The Heart of the Sound: An Alaskan Paradise Found and Nearly Lost.

And given the dangerous- and possibly irreversible- intent of the current Bush administrations environmental decisions, nature writing of the twenty-first century will be even more threatened by doom and more concerned with justice. The title of Marybeth Hollemans The Heart of the Sound immediately discloses her approach: this is a book about her passionate and emotional connection with her landscape, the Prince William Sound on the coast of Alaska. Although Holleman deals ostensibly with the Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989, her book remains timely; as she points out, "Fifteen years after the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef, single-hulled oil tankers, many of them nearing their twenty-five-year retirement age, still traverse the waters of the Sound daily." To paraphrase Thoreau, once you understand the concept of an oil spill, it matters little which tanker ran aground where. Most news is merely gossip. This particular news/gossip is intensely personal for Holleman, made so because of her intensely personal relationship with the natural world. The reader receives the sound through the lens of her emotional states, which turn the book into a memoir rather than a study of an unnatural disaster. As she admits, "Perhaps the Sound showed me that self I was most in need of finding. Perhaps my experiences in this new place, the images I held in my heart, reflected back out into the world, throwing light on that which I needed." Her personification of the sound is revealing: "I felt Prince William Sound gripping me, and I made no move to wrestle free." Her encounter with some oystercatchers - particularly striking shorebirds - illustrates a return to a romanticism handed down from earlier nature writing: "Relate. To interact. To respond. To have relationship or connection. I wanted not just to know about oystercatchers, to identify them and know their scientific name, their habits and habitats. I wanted to experience something shared, some sense of reciprocity, of trust." The result is a close observation, a search for human traits like curiosity, then eye contact. "The oystercatchers kept advancing toward me; one looked right at me. Then another looked. Those brilliant eyes. Black-yellow- orange concentric circles. Bulls eye." Like her other descriptive passages- many of them beautifully detailed - this one concludes with how sh e feels. What is missing here from the earlier tradition in nature writing is any sense of scientific inquiry. Rather than expressing curiosity about the oystercatchers' natural behavior or providing readers with some research concerning it, Holleman reveals a more anthropomorphic position: "Then it was over, and they sauntered down the beach, a low chatter among themselves. I sat back on my heels and studied the waves. I couldn't say we communicated, or related; I couldn't say that any trust was gained. I could say that they didn't fly off or raise their voices or act agitated. That they approached. That I felt, ever so briefly, a mutual awareness without fear." One is reminded, in contrast, of Henry Bestons admonition in The Outermost House (1928):</page><page sequence="3">934 THE GEORGIA REVIEW "Animals," he wrote, "are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth." Hollemans approach to the nonhuman world qualifies her best to understand the inimical nature of the current method of evaluating disasters, as she learns when she sits in on a meeting of sociologists and economists discussing research proposals. " 'You can ask the question two ways. One, ask a person how much they would be willing to pay to have the damage not happen. Two, ask that person how much they would be willing to accept to let that damage happen. So much spent to prevent a spill, so much accepted to let a spill happen.' " Understandably, she is revolted by the response, just as she is frustrated by the work of the many scientists and researchers who came to the sound. "Restoration was defined as restitution for a loss, as returning to a previous and more desirable state, as renewing, giving back. All this counting, tagging, radio -implanting, all these projects, research, buildings - I could not fathom how they would help restore the wild." It all serves to drive her inward, to personify the oil spill, to blend it into the stories of her life. The Heart of the Sound is, in fact, Hollemans story - of her coming to the sound, of her divorce and new love, of her relationship with her son. The disaster is a constant, looming, emotional presence, but it is often used as a trope to reflect her emotional states. For example, she tells a friend, "My counselor said I was feeling smothered And when the oil spill happened, I could relate to it because the literal smothering of animals by oil mirrored the smothering I was feeling in my own life." Her field trips, which previously involved futile and frustrating attempts at cleanup, take on a different tone. Their purpose is to connect the personal with the natural, "to put myself back into the land alone, to understand what that disaster had invoked in me, feelings that resurfaced last spring as a tidal wave of events that had capsized my life." At the books end, she returns again to the sound a decade after the spill, predict- ably "to step forward and reconcile myself to what was left, even find a way to embrace it." But she finds, instead, more to grieve. The sound had been discovered by additional human beings, with their usual litter, noise, and crowding - and the attendant, inevi- table diminishment of wildlife. Holleman then asks a good question: "Why do we call things disasters only when they happen swiftly?" In essence, The Heart of the Sound is a private book, closed to other points of view and single-minded. Yet the passion with which it confronts the enemy, and its unabashed internalizing of the author s landscape, makes the book a prime example of the reappearance of the romantic tradition of nature writing, a tradition shared by a cohort of lovers of nature and defenders of the environment. However, Hollemans easy dismissal of restoration projects that involved the careful collection of data and the</page><page sequence="4">DOUGLAS CARLSON 935 establishment of benchmarks chooses to ignore the empirical sides of a many- faceted issue, relying rather on her emotions alone. Ted Levin allows a much broader view in Liquid Land , an exhaustive examination of south Florida, where the federal government established "the first park in the world based on perishable biologic resources." Levin sees nature as a product of natural and human forces, rather than a construct of the imagination, and he couldn't have chosen a better example. The preindustrial Everglades was a region characterized by flood and drought, a complex abundance of wildlife and habitats, and its own vertically chal- lenged topography (the land is so flat that topo maps have to employ five-foot contour lines rather than the usual ten to show any contour at all). The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary human intervention; during the centurys first half, pure exploitation dominated. "In 1905, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward was elected governor of Florida largely by promising to create an 'Empire of the Everglades by wringing the last drop out of that pestilence-ridden swamp.' To let all the water drain, Broward suggested blasting a hole in the bedrock limestone." Since 1948, the Army Corps of Engineers and other government agencies have engaged in a series of feckless attempts to "tame" the land. Levin's understanding of the region, its problems, and its five decades of failed solutions is clear from the outset: On a January night I stand wet to my waist in sawgrass, listening to an owls lusty pronouncements and the riotous jamming of frogs. Four inches of muck oozing over my sandaled feet, I am part of the diversity of Everglades National Park. Yet that diversity now depends on an ironic reality- a fabricated water- delivery system. Bridled and balkanized by 1,074 miles of canals, 720 miles of levees, 18 major pumping stations, and 250 control or diversion structures, the "true" Everglades has become a computer-controlled watershed almost as artificial as Disney World, two hundred miles to the north. To present this complex relationship of humans and land, he has divided the book into three sections. The first is background, a clear primer of the region necessary for a reader s understanding of what is to follow. But Levin avoids a textbook-dry voice by establishing the narrative device he will use throughout the book. In the tradition of Thoreau's "saunter" out into nature, a longtime staple of nature writing, he goes out to observe and record, then returns to reflect. But his "saint-terre," considerably less hospitable than the Concord woods, is reached by airboat, swamp buggy, airplane, or by arduous and dangerous hikes. And his wanderings aren't solitary and open-ended; he travels in the company of experts- both scientific and local - in search of pieces of the Everglades' ecological puzzle.</page><page sequence="5">936 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Liquid Land s second section, "Natural History," tells of ten of Levins quests and companions. For example, he bands bald eagles with an ornithologist and hunts frogs with a professional frogger; he studies crocodiles with a wildlife scientist, tree snails with a dedicated hobbyist, and even mosquitoes with an entomologist. His account of his search for Florida panthers, a race of the western mountain lion, is representative. By plane and swamp buggy and on foot, Levin explores Big Cypress Swamp, tracking down what he calls the most endangered mammal in South Florida. Only twenty-eight are known to live in the swamp, their principal habitat. The threat to panthers has as its source both natural and human history. The first is a species-specific problem; the second echoes the threat to all Everglades wildlife. Because panthers are so few and their habitat so diminished, inbreeding is the norm. As Levin writes, "As a group, Florida panthers have 85 percent less genetic variability than western mountain lions and a higher frequency of malformed sperm than any other subspecies of mountain lion examined. One biologist claims that if a Florida panther were a human sperm donor, he would be told he was sterile." To manage the problem, scientists are attempt- ing outbreeding: importing animals - in this case, cougars from Texas- to bolster the panthers' endangered gene pool. From a scientific point of view, however, success would be pyrrhic. Genetically, real Florida panthers would have to be destroyed for the Florida panther to be "saved." Exacerbating the biological problem is the ever-present human intrusion. The list of affronts to the landscape grows with numbing regularity in south Florida. First the swamp was logged for its cypress; its land was cleared for pasture; its snails and orchids were pirated by collectors. Then came the real estate agents, along with canals and levees and the fly-by-night land sales that have become a standard Florida joke. The worst of these, according to Levin, was "Golden Gate Estates, the world s largest subdivision. A projected community of four hundred thousand, Golden Gate Estates became one of Floridas most nefarious real estate scams. Spurious salespeople sold twenty-nine thousand lots over the telephone to out-of-state buyers who had no idea that by late June, despite 180 miles of recently dug drainage canals, they would need boats to reach their land." A jetport that would "inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park" was proposed. The proposal was defeated, but "several miles of runway that had been built in 1970 close to Corn Dance Hammock, a sacred site for Miccosukee, will serve as a training airport for commercial pilots." The Big Cypress Nature Preserve allows private investors to retain mineral rights, and hunting is permitted: "one hunting camp operates a thirty-person dorm with a front yard landing strip." Even if the panthers can be saved with modern technology and husbandry, Levin points out that there is really no place to put them. "Unfortunately, without additional land into which the population can expand, the wilds of South Florida will remain, as far as swamp lions [panthers] are concerned, much like a stocked trout stream that</page><page sequence="6">DOUGLAS CARLSON 937 periodically needs a fresh supply of hatchery fish." Elsewhere, he states the problem more simply by referencing the 2000 census. In Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, there are "four and a half million people pressed against the eastern ribs of the Everglades, all dependent upon a finite supply of fresh water." This represents an astounding increase in the ten years between censuses, as Levin observes. "Another more than 700,000 people who need to wash cars and flush toilets. If no one is willing to limit South Floridas growth, the sodden miles of sawgrass and lily will be buried by the hubris of our culture." All of this bad news is presented in clear and depressing detail. The story of the panthers is essentially that of the alligators, crocodiles, and wading birds; no species escapes the list. But Levin still finds time to step back and listen to his heart. Trying to locate panther 54 (they are all tagged and many have radiotelemetry devices), he listens to the buzzing of the radio signal. Amid all the technology and science in a place that appears to have become a giant outdoor lab experiment where water flow is measured daily and wildlife is tracked and monitored, amid all this management and control, Levin is mindful that the Everglades can t be reduced to data. The cats are right here. I stare into the palmettos and imagine the panthers alert beyond my understanding, looking, listening, smelling, taut and tense, like coiled springs, screened by palmettos, invisible to me except for the images that run through my head. A woodpecker flies by, lands on a pine, walks up the trunk, and enters a hole above the cats. The sky brightens to ivory. The lions stay frozen in place, as I ache for something more, a blood- curdling screech or palmetto leaves set in motion by the twitch of a muscle. Later, he searches on his own: "I train my binoculars to the north, looking for some- thing other than heat waves moving across the landscape. Dozens of hammocks merge into a wall of shimmering green, closing off the view. The panther doesn't have to be seen to make this landscape wild. The wild comes with knowing its out there." One of the characteristics that makes Liquid Land more than another Jeremiad is Levins open-minded approach and his ability to see beyond simple cause- and- effect to the interconnection of all human and nonhuman life. His examination of Big Sugar is a superb example. That the large-scale sugar industry is an environmental disaster is beyond question. Because sugar cane must remain dry during the natural wet season, each day a billion gallons of water are pumped out of the sugar fields and diverted from the Everglades. And each year two hundred metric tons of phosphorous from Big Sugars fertilized fields flow into the Everglades. That Big Sugar is an economic disaster is apparent from the huge government subsidies needed to prop it up. Accord- ing to James Bovard of the Cato Institute, "Paying lavish subsidies to produce sugar in Florida makes as much sense as creating a federal subsidy program to grow bananas in Massachusetts."</page><page sequence="7">938 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Yet Levin doesn't treat the issue in the usual good-savior/bad-exploiter way. The sugar industry came to Florida via a classic example of the famous butterfly wing corol- lary of chaos theory. Among the effects of Castros overthrow of the Batista regime in Cuba was the nationalization of the sugar industry. When the United States embargoed Cuban sugar in i960, Alfonso Fanjul Sr. and other exiles reestablished the industry in Florida, providing jobs for thousands of exiled workers. Environmentalists found themselves lined up with anti- Cuban sentiment that prevailed in the region, and the rhetoric took on a racial tone. Unusual battle lines were drawn, with Jesse Jackson saying, in support of sugar interests, "We should never have a showdown between people and alligators. We should always choose people." And Levin pointedly wonders why the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, famous for its environmental good works in the Amazon but also in control of U.S. Sugar, isn't targeted by environmentalists as enthusiastically as are Cubans. The reader is reminded that environmentalism and its technology are viewed with suspicion and distaste by many humans most affected by environmental change. A sugar harvester complains, "Them engineers shoulda left the Kissimmee alone in the first place, and they sure as hell can't fix it now. The government don't live here." A foreman supervising the removal of meladuca, an Australian tree that was imported to stop erosion and now infests a half million acres in South Florida, says, "Half the state legislature calls Havana home, and the other half lives in New York. What do they know?" Levin stresses throughout that people are a part of the Everglades' diversity, and most share the sentiments of the frogger who has lost his livelihood because of federal regulations: "Nobody never figured a frog out." Levin is not a slave to science and technology. He points out that the $8 bil- lion Everglades restoration project has no known outcome. "How will the success of Everglades restoration be measured: Should the Everglades look like it did circa 1900, before the marsh was drained? Or perhaps it should be the 1947 version, the year President Truman dedicated Everglades National Park. Or maybe a more recent vintage, say, the mid-1970s, the last good year for nesting wading birds. Maybe it will be different from anything it has ever been before." The problem is clear, however, and monumental: "The main objective of res- toration is to recapture trillions of gallons of freshwater currently flushed out to sea and to eventually redirect that lost water back to the ailing wetlands without flooding South Florida's corporate farms and booming cities." This huge task is only part of the solution, according to Levin. Repairing the water movements will not magically fix a system that might have already suffered irreparable harm. "Eighteen hundred miles of canals and levees have already drained half the Everglades and chopped up the other half, rendering the landscape habitable for people and vegetables but untenable for alligators, egrets, and dozens of other Everglades -dependent species; the disruption of seasonal water flows has wreaked havoc on the ecosystem's delicate balance; phos-</page><page sequence="8">DOUGLAS CARLSON 939 phorous runoff from the sugarcane fields has severely diminished water quality. And invasive species are replacing natives at a rapid pace." Surprisingly, Levin is able to inject a sense of hope, as he does on a trip to find Shingle Creek, the source of the Everglades north of Lake Okeechobee. This hope comes from the natural world itself, from the persistence of life in the gambusia, a small freshwater fish: To see Shingle Creek I drive to the outskirts of Orlando, to an Aerobic Sewage Treatment Plant on McLeod Street. Here a thin, methane-reeking tributary passes through a culvert beneath the road Contrary to other wilderness watersheds in North America, which begin in snow-capped mountains or pristine lakes, the Everglades drainage begins in the suburbs and becomes wilder the farther it travels from its inauspicious source. Gambusia, how- ever, find something to recommend the creek, they dimple the surface like raindrops. A green heron and a great egret wait with glacial patience for the fish to swim by. * Both Holleman and Levin reveal a personal connection with their landscapes; even Levins encyclopedic analysis of connections among natural and cultural forces is dot- ted with the use of metaphor rather than reason. Also, an often unspoken and more profound relationship in these books, and in most current nature writing, involves a spiritual element. In Absence and Light , John B. Campbell confronts this element directly and presents a working out of how the spirit of the land has infused the spirit of one man. The result is a collection of meditations that can be read as might any poetry collection gathered under one theme: as a whole, in related sections, or as individual pieces. The prose is careful, beautifully descriptive, and thoroughly engaging. Campbells landscape is the Klamath Basin on the California/Oregon border, a habitat famous for its remarkable abundance of migratory waterfowl that stage there in numbers up to a million. These numbers are down from what Campbell estimates to have been six million, the wetlands themselves covering less than twenty-five per- cent of the area they once did. He could easily be referring to Hollemaris or Levins book - as well as to most other nature writing - when he describes the contemporary approach to the threatened land: "When a biblical sense of a fall from grace informs our understanding of the land, absent landscapes become paradisaical Everywhere the past is characterized by abundance, the present by diminishment, so that a viable future requires some gross form of salvation." Thus, he abandons the paradise lost and the doubtful future and presents his poetic program: "I require a full and present communion with the earth. How might I realign my thinking in order to enter into the moment? ... I must realize the self as the earth and try to continue as the earth itself will."</page><page sequence="9">940 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Whereas most writers approach nature as a product of cultural and natural forces or of myth and theology, a metaphor that grows naturally from "an industrial and consumer-based culture," Campbell suggests the possibility of new metaphors- which, incidentally, reflect some very old ones. One new metaphor would include quantum theory and would glance back to the Buddhist concept of emptiness. Since subatomic particles hold no meaning in and of themselves but rather in connection with the whole, Campbell may conclude: "When I realize that nothing exists except as an intimate collaborator with others, the concepts of product and producer become conflated. ... I am not a product of the world as much as I am part and parcel of the pattern we call earth." Further, Campbell asserts that absent landscapes from our various paradises lost are real: in the genes handed down from prehistoric animals; in absent makers of geological forms such as rivers, glaciers, and volcanoes; in the "pre-original space, which informs the creation even as it is re-placed." This presence of absence, taken with the emptiness of all matter, creates a void, a state of mind wherein Campbell can "realize the self as the earth." For him, natures accommodation of all life and death is a process that he calls "an unfathomable interplay of surfaces." By surfaces, he means "texture, odor, ambient sound, and, most of all, light." The process is unfathomable because once he places himself in the void, it becomes (and here he paraphrases Lao- tzu) "utterly mysterious because its so completely known." It would be fair to say that much of the first part of Absence and Light is more ruminating-while-outdoors than actual nature writing, if not for the fact that Camp- bells subject throughout is the Klamath Basin, not the inside of his head. The bulk of the meditations share a reading of the landscape that is always mindful of the inter- connectedness of all things. He allows his readers a new way to see nature- or, as he would say, to he nature. "One can inhabit this place in spirit. . . . One can realize the impossibly Romantic notion of the individual as it is actually borne out in nature: we are each nodes in a vast and intricate web that vibrates subtly, everywhere, with every local movement." Further, he is always aware of himself as storyteller, knowing that the emptiness is limned by the individual observing the "surfaces," that no observa- tion is complete without the life and death of the observer. Beyond personification or empathy, his voice attempts to speak from the "oneness," a New Age coinage that he carefully avoids. The first of the books three sections, "Absences," contains most of the abstract material and has a slightly prefatory feel. He concludes the section with two passages that can serve as demonstration pieces for his narrative approach. The first involves a transformation through imagination, a counterpoint to the personification of nature - that is, an "animalization" of the observer: "So I imagine what draws the geese, how the sheen of water as seen from the air becomes actual habitat as we descend, feet splayed. I imagine the splash, and the feel of the pond as it brushes my belly, as it buoys me up.</page><page sequence="10">DOUGLAS CARLSON 94I Although at first attracted by abstract notions, I soon discover that the silver waters are real. They are shallow, transient, and cold." In the second key passage, Campbell has hiked to Lake Natashia, a pristine body of water in the Southern Cascades. His hiking there to bathe is pure symbol: "This morning I bathe in the purest lake in the world, laughing in its extraordinary body as I perform my ablutions. Moving heron-slow, I lie to the world with my posture. I'm a harmless snag; I'm stripped of my bark; I'm benevolent; I'm a roost. When I finally shiver, it's not because of wonder or anything profound. It's simply because of the cold." Self-conscious as these passages are, they make their point. The remainder of the book moves easily within the possibilities Campbell has set for himself, always aware of presenting his landscape as a process to his audience- sharing, showing, and enabling. Campbell's awareness of the natural world as process allows him to abandon the usually stationary eye of the speaker so as to observe the unseen, to capture nuance, to enter and exit at will. A flock of snow geese, for example, becomes a revelation of scale. He watches individuals join small flocks that mingle and cross larger flocks, sometimes forming a synchronous whole, sometimes creating massive chaos. This scale draws him and the reader into a new way of seeing, "And I'm lucky enough to be proximate to this joy, overwhelmed by animal motions, my senses swimming among dreamy shadows. Looking up, I see the sun in the geese's wings: not the sun filtered, not the sun beyond, but the innocent sun flooding the labyrinth of feathers, illuminat- ing the barbs, and the bristles on mites I know I can't see." His access to the invisible world provides another gateway: the scale can expand to the mythic, as it does in his meditation on bald eagles feeding on the carcasses of tundra swans. "The eagles carve up the carcasses with talons meant only for this. What sophisticated feeders, and what sophisticated food: swans that find these marshes over obstacles continental in scale, only to fail in the eagles' beaks. Their demise serves others so purely, as their protein cycles in the overcast skies. So is it wrong to observe these exchanges as feast days, to praise the eagles and their perfect martyrs as animal saints?" The spirit can enter the land as a personal or moral presence as well, because cul- tural history is layered with natural history into a sense of place, not as cause-and-effect or producer-and-product but as merely another presence. Past acts of shame - the war of extermination against the Modocs, the Japanese internment camps, the crimes against nature by the Bureau of Reclamation - join the otherness of petroglyphs, the intensity of Campbell's mourning over the recent deaths of his parents. These are just a few of Campbell's landscapes. And each of us, as readers, brings our own various landscapes until the place is alive with nuance and motion. Campbell's approach is most successful in his shorter meditations. When the pieces become essayistic or when he strays too far and too long from the concrete, the sense of blurred edges, lost identity, and universality fades. But, when moving spontaneously around the surfaces that delineate absence, he is able to achieve his</page><page sequence="11">942 THE GEORGIA REVIEW goal: to "realize the self as earth." Listening to the trumpeting of swans echo off the mountains, he repeatedly turns his head to the "ghost of their calls." And he finds, "in the presence of birds, a periphery where something dances almost unperceived ." Why, he continues, when I gaze straight on at a swirling assembly of white-fronted geese, do I keep refocusing on the near distance? Some sort of hatch: mosquito-like bugs, but with feathery antennae and purplish, translucent wings. Hovering in the foreground, against the rising and dipping flocks, the swarm is a miniature, magical double, an emissary emerging from the riot of life. Obscurity may be revelatory, and a joy might lie in the tension between the unknown and the known. Centers are replaced by peripheries as simple individuals segue into the complexity of their environs. One draws closer in these shorter pieces to Campbells designation, "meditations " At their best, these become meditations in the religious sense, especially in the practice of some Eastern religions. Of the books examined in this essay, Gretei Ehrlichs investigation of climate change, The Future of Ice, satisfies most because it contains and broadens the approaches of the other three. For the body, mind, and spirit she has made, in her words, both "ode and lament, a wild-time song and elegy, and a cry for help - not for me, but for the tern, the ice cap, the polar bear, and the lenga forest; for the river of weather and the ways it chooses to be born." Ehrlich speaks in many voices: storyteller, natural historian, journalist, mem- oirist, and poet. Her narration is always engaging and forthright, and her analysis has the weight of science and research. Most gratifying is an imagery that takes risks, enlarges, and clarifies. She gives necessary space to the fact of global warming, but focuses on what will be- is being - lost. Her metaphorical expression of winter allows the imagination to realize the soul of ice. Winter is "refuge and deathbed, monastery and ivory tower, cave and ghost." Its uses are liberating: "Winter is purgation. It emp- ties us out. Darkness fills the void and snow drains it with light." And its comforts are cold: "Winter is a time when we see into things We break through ice to come on more ice, one translucent door opening onto another. If blizzards bring on oblivion, their winds also whisk it away. Whats left is a swept-out room of stark beauty and clear light." Ehrlich records her search for winter and ice in six essays. Stories of three journeys - hiking to glaciers at the southern tip of Chile, canoeing down the Spanish River in Wyoming on the first open water of spring, and sailing north to the edge of polar ice- are interlaced with three meditations centered on her Wyoming homeplace in winter. Throughout the book, the correspondences among all living things frame</page><page sequence="12">DOUGLAS CARLSON 943 her arguments and shape her images. In some cases, the connection takes the form of simple lessons and insights. For example, the life of a glacier, its "accumulation and ablation," becomes the give and take of human life. Other connections are more personal and intense. With graceful candor, Ehrlich examines her deep loneliness upon a separation in Chile from her traveling companion. She finds solace when she notices Arctic terns about to begin their migration. "All that's holding me together at the moment is the thought of the terns in the middle of their molt Discarded flight feathers bump across the chop. The birds wait. Wind grooves the Weddell Sea; new flight feathers are growing." Later, she remembers the terns' departure and return as she watches one, through tears, near the end of her Arctic cruise. The promise of the cycle buoys her, as does the knowledge that each completion of the cycle is different from its beginning. And once more she opens her heart: "the terns contrails of sinew, feather, and bone are the only things carrying me." From her nonhuman others, especially her beloved dog, Sam, whose life and death figure importantly in the book, Ehrlich is continually receiving grace. For example, consider her poignant encounters with bearded seals and their mating songs on her Arctic journey: "These are watery calls of longing, a complex frequency that is wavering, fragile, doomed, eerie, and beautiful. . . . What is it that lifts the notes after they fall? Love and loss and more love- don t they always happen in the same kind of rushing slowness and arching falls?" Ehrlich and her shipmates listen via microphone and headphones, and when a friend onboard suffers a terrible loss, she connects him into the circle of all things by putting the headphones to his ear. This simple and powerful act of empathy comes from her knowledge of universal interconnectedness. "Under me, bearded seals dive deep to rake the benthic mud with long whiskers for food. At this moment I'm anything but lonely, and can no longer say T or me.' It is us,' all twenty-four of us bound together by . . . the sudden beauty coming into our eyes and ears." She finds, as she says, "what Emerson called 'the soul of the whole,' in which what is seen and the seer, what is heard and the listener, are one." The circle is a unifying presence in all the essays. A circular hike on a Chilean mountain opens the book with a conscious image that suggests all of her wanderings as a search for cycles- death and rebirth, departure and return. And the circle becomes a fact of life, yielding sadness and despair, hope and joy. Remembering dead friends, she feels that she is "being handed from ghost to ghost. Dying is a way of complet- ing a circle." Canoeing the meanders of the Spanish River, she sees the river trying to return to itself but failing - another death. But in this case, "At least we have lived and died and lived again. Every bend is a kind of death. Not death's death, but the end of the instant, and the release of the riverscape before the next one comes." The river's oxbow loops reveal the yin-yang principle binding everything together: the return and the start and the whole. "At the point where the river comes closest to meeting itself, I</page><page sequence="13">944 THE GEORGIA REVIEW can see the duck grabbing at things as if catching strands of water in its beak. He finds one, then another, and another, and pulls, until finally, the whole river comes straight and begins its long southward journey." Ehrlichs "ode and lament" contains a warning. "Cycles and circles enclose us. They are all fixed paths, closed circuits, and we have to live with what we've created within them. Beauty and pollution ride the same trails." Emerson's "soul of the whole" has its lethal downside because "Every movement in nature evokes a response." She observes this first in the mountains while watching condors. "When a condor jumps and flaps its wings, the pressurized air slams against the mountains, wiping mist off, pushing a boat- shaped shadow over our heads. Every brush of a wing has repercus- sions. A piece of ice calves, a bow wave pulls across a lake; a stone is turned and a river changes course; a dust mote rises into a cloud and comes down as snow; a tree dies and the global climate changes." A matter-of-fact recitation of environmental disasters grows from correspondences. The lament is all too familiar to environmentally aware readers, and is one connected, in this case, to chaos theory, deep ecology, and what used to be called "the web of life." As Ehrlich puts it, "Land-ocean-atmosphere-solar- galactic cycles are inextricably linked. One flap of the butterfly and everyone fries." Her summary is both elegiac and frightening, a worthy summary for the various voices of nature writing today. The sense of loss has deepened, solutions appear distant, and personal comfort is more difficult to attain: I walk ... in circle after circle and tend the twig fire of love with no pos- session, no future, only today and today, one year becoming another. I try to remember the economic lessons of the glacier, the amorous ones of the bearded seal, the terns' hope, the winter rivers beauty, and the teachings of Sam. . . . This world is all ours, belonging to each of us: swan, crane, walrus, wren, dog, muskrat, saxifrage, pine, polar bear, you, me. But too many of us have relinquished our hold on the natural world and turned toward power and the ownership of things. The personal enticements of nature remain available- whether emotional, intellectual, or spiritual. But Ehrlich makes it clear that, like the other authors considered here, she believes the time to rescue some former state of the natural world has passed. At issue now is whether our new, diminished version will survive. This is the lesson that the future of ice teaches.</page></plain_text>
