<plain_text><page sequence="1">words, it means termite mound. Although the termite mound is a spiritual area, nothing in its Bamana name proclaims that "it is a gate- way to the spiritual world." In analyzing some passages Brett-Smith constantly refers to Bazin or Dumestre to justify the meaning of a given word (which makes it erroneous from start) rather than relying on indigenous, ver- nacular explanations. She herself appears to have the command of Bamana necessary for such an exercise. I strongly disagree with many passages in which the author implies that the Bamana and Malinke associate a variety of matters with sex or sexual intercourse; she asserts, for example, that "they identify termite mounds with female sex" (p. 122) and then goes on to say that "men take their most profound oath by invoking their mother's sex." The latter state- ment is particularly problematic. A man may say, "A be ne ni n'woloba ce" (I swear by my birth mother; lit. "May it be left between my mother and myself") or "A be ne ni n'ba sin [ji] ce" ("I swear by my mother's breast[milk]"), but a mother's "sex" (vagina) is the last thing a Bamana or Malinke man would mention, even in drunkenness or madness. He would sooner die than refer to it.7 In too many instances Brett-Smith creates associations with sex through inaccurate translations or assumptions, as illustrated by the introduction to Chapter 6. Here (p. 203) "Gundow jujb ye min ye, ceya ni musoya" (Nyamanton Diarra, April 15, 1984; second interview) is given as "The root of all sacred secrets is the following: Man's penis and woman's vagina." An accurate translation would be: "The root of all sacred secrets is the following: Manhood/maleness and woman- hood/femaleness." (The original statement in Bamana, if one uses the author's English translation, would have been "Gundow jujb ye min ye, ce ceya ni muso musoya.") Further, Brett- Smith's analogy between penis and dog and her additional comments in the endnotes are not accurate (p. 210). Wulu, penis, and wulu, dog, have different tones and thus sound totally different.8 With regard to the act of sculpting, manyokolon means "detail," not "penis...wo- man's ornaments"; kulukutuma means "rough" (wood with its bark on, unprocessed), not "nude"; and walaki means "to remove the bark," not "disrobe," as is suggested on page 188. In many other instances, this book goes too far in comparing sculpting with sexuali- ty, stretching the meanings of words out of their contexts. Nevertheless Brett-Smith gives some good explanations of sexual taboos and provides invaluable insights into Bamana and Malinke male and female sexuality. Her analysis of excision (pp. 43-45) is one of the most insight- ful yet to be found in the literature. Her dis- cussion of women's involvement in carving ritual objects sheds light on the discipline of African-art studies in the Mande world. This discussion is especially important considering the fact that females not so long ago partici- pated directly in other activities that appar- ently were exclusive male.9 The book contains an excellent array of good-quality photographs, some of which give the reader a sense of the chronology of sculpting and provide visual support for the ideas being presented. However, a few errors in their presentation and analysis could have been avoided. For example, in the table of illustrations on page ix, no. 17, and the expla- nation of Figure 17 on page 96, a mask type clearly identified as White Sheep is wrongly translated as saga jigi (ram) rather than saga muso je. The author acknowledges that the mask she was carved was deliberately not endowed with power, but does not mention why it was said to be a white sheep-why not a white ram? The choice of animal is impor- tant in sacrifice. Goats and dogs figure more than sheep in Bamana and Malinke tradition- al religions; sheep are more closely related to the Islamic tradition and are therefore less powerful in terms of the energy they release. Additional problematic analyses appear on pages 244-45, for Figures 58 and 59. Figure 58 is a piece of mudcloth which Brett-Smith calls Fugan feere; she defines fugan as "a flat, rocky space in the bush where there is no veg- etation, and feere is the ample space in the cen- ter of a village. Fugan can also mean 'tied up' or 'bound' " (p. 244 n.). She should have writ- ten Fuga fere. That term refers to a flat, treeless, but not necessarily rocky area which is usual- ly covered with a species of grass called nkasan. It is a space filled with energy. There is no evidence, however, that it connotes human infertility. The author explains Fugan as "tied up" or "bound" to support the idea of infertil- ity linked to the mudcloth's designs. Yet the verb ka X fugan (to tie up X) is in no way semantically implied in Fuga fere. Figure 59 is a piece of mudcloth called Banank&amp;or bolon or Manta bolon, depending on the artist making these designs. Again, Brett- Smith's interpretation is problematic. Banan- kbrb and Manta are the names of villages, and bolon here means streets rather than vestibule, as she translates it. While Figure 59 suggests a well-populated town, and by inference fertili- ty, there is not enough semantic evidence to balance it against Figure 58.10 Another shortcoming of this book is the literal interpretation of metaphors. For exam- ple, one informant spoke of "one unripe man- go split between two people once a day" as what a family subsisted on during the peri- od of hunger (p. 6). Such a metaphor is meant to dramatize the severity of the famine, but it is not meant to be taken liter- ally. Anybody who has lived anywhere in the Beledugu knows that while mangoes are in season there are plenty of them for people to eat. Another similar metaphor refers to Bamana digging termite mounds for food (p. 124), and in her notes, the author tries to jus- tify why Bamana eat termite dirt. There is no evidence for this interpretation.11 The Making of Bamana Sculpture is an impor- tant document not only for students in African- art studies but also for scholars in the social sci- ences. There is no doubt that its author knows much about the people whose art forms and spirituality she describes from a rarely matched diversity of perspectives. Perhaps the most important achievement of the book will be to inspire Africanists to continue the debate about how they do their research. D Notes, page 102 SACRED ARTS OF HAITIAN VODOU Edited by Donald J. Cosentino UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, Los Angeles, 1995. 446 pp., 600 b/w &amp; 250 color illus- trations, notes, bibliography, glossary. $89 hard- cover, $49 softcover. Reviewed by Allen F Roberts Here it is, the book many of us have been long awaiting. The appearance of a great book is an event, and we all know the joys of becoming so engrossed that such a tome cannot be put down. Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou goes a step further, for it is both a stunning scholarly achievement and demanding in its own, high- ly unusual ways. The subject and its presenta- tion are evocative to a degree that I have rarely, if ever, experienced. Indeed, once lost in these pages, the reader is ridden. And lost one soon becomes, in the labyrinth of detail of Vodou art and praxis that is purposefully so marvelously eclectic. The shrine illustrated on the cover of Sacred Arts immediately draws us into what Arnold Rubin (1974) might have called a "synaesthet- ic totality," a collage so richly varied that the eye is obliged to linger. The palm of a plaster hand with two broken but repaired fingers is the central focus, but it is sequestered among sequined bottles, ribbon-wrapped bundles, chromolithographs and plaster figures of the Virgin and Catholic saints, crucifixes, cups, costumed dolls, gourds, bottles of rum, more wrapped and beaded things, a candlestick supported by Casper the Friendly Ghost (?), feathers, a portrait of Aristide, brightly lit can- dles, and a swirl of ever more colorful stuff. As Donald Cosentino puts it, in such "Creole melange," "taxonomies slip, roles reverse, ends become means" (p. 39), and the "'prod- ucts of culture have all gone crazy"' (p. 30, paraphrasing William Carlos Williams). Flipping through the pages, one sees more and more altars, each drawing the gaze into a maelstrom of meaning by creating a "place where the world comes to a point"-ibi sonso in Yoruba (Thompson 1993:147)-the same "sublime point" sought by Surrealists as "a spot on a mental mountain, where all the con- traries impossibly meet" (Caws 1993:38).' Such creations overcome "the tyranny of 'already"' (Konate &amp; Savane 1994:75), for as Cosentino tells us, "there is no 'was' in Haitian history" (p. 259). Their eclecticism places us "ahead of our ideas and our desires, [through] an image magnificent in its shock and its irreverence" (Simic 1993:30), allowing triumph over the stultifying "single mean- ing" of established authority (cf. Bakhtin african arts spring 1996 91 african arts . spring 1996 91</page><page sequence="2">1984:123). We are left with the fervent expec- tation that despite all the indignities suffered by Haitian people, "the creation of the world is not yet finished" (Simic 1993:30) for them, or for us either. The organization of the Sacred Arts of Vodou book follows something of this same logic: it, too, is stuffed with stuff. Remarkably though, every bit finds a place, and even Henrietta Cosentino's introductory "Note on Orthography" raises important issues. "In the rendering of a given word, which history is empowered, and which obscured? Whose pronunciation is privileged? What are the politics of nasalization? [certainly a rarely asked question, and].... Just as phonetic spelling [such as the editors have chosen] veils connections with French, it can also obscure African roots, or confuse Fon with Kongo ones. What are the politics of veil- ing?" (p. xiv). By this last, we are led to won- der, What is the editors' "politics of veiling"?2 Still, Henrietta Cosentino raises points such as these knowing full well that, like the book's glossary, they will "no doubt [bel a source of consternation to almost everyone for some reason or other" (p. xiv). One is not meant to be left indifferent by this or the rest of the book. Another challenge is the book's layout. It is now standard for exhibition books to pre- sent a parallel text in illustration captions, thus increasing the enjoyment of those who choose not to read the essays; but Sacred Arts often presents three or more parallel texts in captions for a profusion of spectacular field and object photographs, boxed commentaries (some running beneath several pages), fre- quent double-spread interleaves, background veve designs, epigrams, and other content that competes with a reader's ability to proceed through chapters in a linear fashion. Instead, "lecto-surfing" is promoted, allowing one to open and enter the volume almost anyplace. The book's own "synaesthetic totality" res- onates with that of Vodou itself, then, and "the essays...jostle one another like objects on a Vodou altar" (p. 28). Such an effect, howev- er engaging, makes the reviewer's task nigh onto impossible! Let us begin at the beginning, nonetheless. Donald Cosentino's "Imagine Heaven" intro- duces Vodou and the ways that it "affirms its spiritual powers by a continuing access to divine inspiration" (p. 26). We have been warned that "politics would not be ignored" (p. xii) as the Sacred Arts project evolved, and as we have come to expect from his previous writing, Cosentino's work here is full of fire- works. He lambastes "the egregious depravi- ty of the whole missionary enterprise" in Haiti (p. 38), for example, and asserts that despite continuing attempts to suppress the vitality of Vodou, "Catholicism does not eclipse African religion; it extends it." Indeed, "Vodou achieves the hard heaven Catholics only imagine" by its "blinding successes" in "making realness real" (pp. 31, 52, 55). He then presents the "overdetermination" of Vodou arts, "enfolding multiple sources" as colonial culture "metastasized" (pp. 30,33), in ways that sometimes seem symbolically rau- cous, if not downright cacophonous. Cosentino's greatest accomplishment in Sacred Arts is his detective work, leading to electrifying descriptions of how at Haitian Independence in 1791, the odd costumes, peculiarly secret places, and bizarre behavior of French peasant-Catholic missionaries, Freemasons, and commedia dell'arte actors were coopted into the ever-changing improv that was and still is Vodou. "Vodou cere- monies have remained intensely theatrical" (p. 41) in ways that can only be described ade- quately by an author like Cosentino, whose rare talent for startling juxtapositions plunges readers into ethos in a way impossible for more staid writers.3 His novelistic approach rips the reader from complacency. Imagine: "Pilgrims arrive at Plaine-du-Nord wearing blue suits and red scarves, or the multi-striped rad penitans. More secular visitors wear T- shirts celebrating the lascivious possibilities of Getting Naked at Panama Beach" (p. 244). Quite obviously, Cosentino is likely to have seen a single person wearing such a shirt, but the point is not the accuracy of the observation, but the accuracy of the observation. We experience the dissonance as he did, with a Surrealist's smile. By the time Cosentino shows a movie image of Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, ex- plaining that it "really" represents the god Ogou (p. 249), we have "gotten" it: in Vodou, anything can be or become everything, in a storm of multilayered meaning on the verge of busting loose. Extending these thoughts, Cosentino pon- ders why it is that the Establishment mocks and fears Vodou, concluding that "much of the terror 'voodoo' inspires among foreign and domestic outsiders stems from its polyvocality" (p. 53). The truth of Vodou won't sit down, be still, or shut up. What most bothers conservatives, of course, is just this: that Vodou is always out of control-at least their control. Cosentino's last word is his best: "Vodou produces the finest popular art in the world. The tragedy is that for all the art, beauty, music, and magic Vodou has given the world, the Haitian people have received nothing comparable in return" (p. 55). Nor are they likely to in the foreseeable future, eh Mr. Helms? Cosentino is always a hard act to follow, but Suzanne Blier's piece on the west African (or more specifically, the Fon) roots of Vodou brings the reader firmly back to earth. For Fon people of the Republic of Benin, a great vari- ety of spirits, things, persons, body parts, and occupations can be vodun, and these are listed in jarringly defined boxes beside Blier's text. All have anthropomorphic attributes (even when they are already human body parts), and each stated spirit, thing, or quality is in reality a paradigm, so that "each disease thus constitutes a different Sagbata, each lightning type is a distinct Hevioso" (p. 66), and so forth. This diffusion lends itself to what Blier finds "the primacy of assemblage" in Fon aes- thetics (p. 75), a point she has nicely elucidat- ed in earlier writing, and one I feel she could make even more strongly than she does here. Having worked in many parts of Africa over the past thirty years, I have encountered no cultures that glory in the achievements of assemblage as do Fon, Aja, Evhe, and related peoples along the coast of Benin and Togo. In other words, beyond tracing the origins of Haitian eclecticism to Benin, one must further stress how unusual this perspective (or at least the degree of its development) is to these progenitors of Haitian Vodou. Blier's final points are also her most provocative, as she reviews her recent think- ing about bocio "empowered cadavers" (p. 73). Through her earlier writing, we know bocio best as figures that are often wrapped, pegged, pierced, bedecked, and otherwise ad- dressed to protect the possessor and defeat any who would thwart his or her goals. Here she stresses that nonfigurative objects may serve the same purposes, and that these are assembled from a long list of additives to acti- vate intention. Such practices are among the eclectic elements of Haitian Vodou for which one can demonstrate or speculate direct inher- itance from Benin, and Blier suggests that they may contribute to the creation of paket Kongo, veve cosmograms, the centering de- vices called pwen (point in French), bottle trees, and other things that we have come to assume of Kongo inspiration, following the scholar- ship of Robert Farris Thompson. While there may be an element of "move-over-Bob-ism" in her assertion, Blier is correct to note that in all likelihood, ideas from Fon, Kongo, and indeed, other African peoples, contribute to the synaesthesia of Vodou (p. 87). Thompson's own contribution to Sacred Arts follows Blier's, but is not a direct response (although observations such as "Dahomean ground-circles were complicated in Haiti by the Kongo cosmogram" and rest upon "the bedrock of Central African linguistic model" [p. 102] contribute to the debate). Instead, he riffs on his lifelong passion for drums and drumming, with all the descriptive exuberance we have come to expect from him. For exam- ple, we learn that "both Rada drums in north- ern Haiti and sacred Dahomean dress call down purity on zigzag 'roads' like the edge of the sword of Gu," and "such drums seem gods incarnate" (p. 98). He ends with brief discus- sions of veve, sequins (that "translate, into visu- al creole, the ancient dotting patterns which in Kongo stood for spotted mediatory felines, civet-cat and leopard, moving between the two worlds, bush and village" [p. 1071), and magi- cal bundles that draw upon "the spiritualized minefields of Kongo" (p. 106). Thompson is as insightfully outrageous as ever, but although it is probably explained by the overlapped tim- ing of the two projects, it is nonetheless disap- pointing that he does not take this occasion to draw distinct parallels to and take the next steps beyond his magnificent "Face of the Gods" program (1993). In particular, I hope that close attention will be paid to the "revivi- fication" of the "Sacred Arts" altars (p. xvi) in their daily use by exhibition viewers, and that someone will compare these performances to those occurring during the "life" (obviously the appropriate term) of "Face." 92 african arts* spring 1996 92 african arts ? spring 1996</page><page sequence="3">Sidney Mintz and Michel-Rolph Trouillot next present "The Social History of Haitian Vodou." "Surely no other 'religion of Ne- groes' has ever received so much attention [as Vodou has over the years], nor was it ever as important to demean its content" (p. 125). Mintz contributes an anthropologist's sense of social process, as he describes how slavery was "a fundamentally individualizing experi- ence" and a trauma that demanded "drastic resocializing"-"drastic because it proceeded under the constant threat of violence and even death; resocializing because it demand- ed the learning of wholly different behavioral patterns by its subjects and victims" (pp. 125-26, original emphasis). There followed intense "culture-building" from the fund of "words, objects, songs, gestures, associations, [and] specific beliefs" brought to Haiti that would be patched together, so that certain appropriate elements were emphasized and became normative in these new circum- stances (p. 127).4 The authors then investigate the "premium on practice" (p. 131) implicit to such social assemblage, in order to better understand why it is that Vodou is so often reduced to and dismissed as "sorcery" by outside skeptics. Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique picks up some of these same threads in what is, for me, the most stimulating single piece of the Sacred Arts collection. She begins her disquisition on Vodoun (she refuses to drop the final n from "Vodou") with a poignant statement by an elderly oungan (Vodou practitioner) who knew he faced execution in the 1986 govern- ment-sponsored "Uprooting" of Vodou. "They may burn the drums they wish, destroy the temples they care to....All can and shall be replaced. It is like the wind: coming and going, ever re- newed." And saying this, the Vener- able One would extennnnd the word vodounnnnnnn, making it at once hol- low and full, light and deep....The word turned wind. VodOUN: A wind that cannot be uprooted. (p. 153, emphasis and second ellipsis in original) Beauvoir-Dominique lends special attention to the "dynamics of transformation, inner ten- sion, and the underlying constructs of action that are the essence of the present: the logic of underground realms. Subversive fumes, explosions of latency" (p. 153). She also considers the "history full of reversal" that characterizes the years of early oppression in Haiti, contributing insight to Cosentino's presentation of the importance of Freemasonry to the culture-building of early Vodou. Beauvoir-Dominique's most insightful passages concern Vodou magic, which de- pends upon "a constant process of optimiza- tion," accumulation, and transformation, through a "spirit of salvaging, [and] rebuild- ing in synthetic layers" that are "channeled" and concentrated through certain "'rulings' or protocol" (p. 166). Here she takes a step be- yond description of assemblage, to wonder how and why it works. I do not agree with all her assertions,5 but she makes a valiant and highly engaging attempt to move far beyond the obvious, as she considers conundrums such as "the internal struggle of contradicto- ry unity" (p. 176)-the oxymoronic "chang- ing continuity" also discussed by Karen McCarthy Brown (p. 223). Vodou magic "spe- cializes in the confrontation, interweaving, and overtaking of contradiction. To reconcile opposites, it begins by presenting the impos- sibility of their resolution. Thus it denounces the outrage and ferocity of incomplete com- prehension. At other times, however, it glori- fies knowledge, albeit fragmentary, or exalts specific capacities" (p. 176). We are left in awe of the oungan's courageous attempt to grasp the ungraspable. What follows is Laennec Hurbon's "Ameri- can Fantasy and Haitian Vodou," at once a use- ful and problematic piece. Hurbon reviews the history of intervention by U.S. forces in Haiti and the Caribbean, and the racist ideology that often motivated or at least accompanied these scandalous adventures. He also presents books and films that have reflected and contributed to the exoticism associated with "Voodoo" in the minds of many Americans. But his thesis is marred by exaggeration, non sequiturs, and lack of evidence, as when he nonsensically asserts that an author named John Craige "does not hesitate to salivate over his first con- tacts with the Haitian population: 'it is interest- ing,' he writes, 'I had understood that there were a great number of cannibals in Haiti'" (p. 189). He brands such statements as racist, then cannot reconcile these views with Haitian statements that (from an insider's point of view) cannibalism does exist, weakly counter- ing that these are merely "metaphorical" accounts (p. 195). By whose authority are they "only" that? Isn't this dismissive of local reality? Perhaps it is not the content of Vodou but rather what one deduces from it that may be racist. The "stereotypes" of "zombification" and other aspects of Vodou that Hurbon decries, even in the work of Zora Neale Hurston (p. 190), do need to be addressed, but one must step back farther from them than Hurbon has been able or willing to do here, to sort out what is and is not a "stereotype" and where the wild exuber- ance of Vodou (see, for example, Cosentino's "Envoi" about phallic celebration in the name of Gede, the trickster) ends, and exoticism and racism truly begin. Such a task is by no means an easy one, and in some ways it is hindered rather than advanced in some of these same pages. Hurbon's text (pp. 188-89) is accompanied by five illustrations from William Seabrook's Magic Isle and Richard Loederer's Voodoo Fire in Haiti, both from around 1930, which are bluntly captioned as "racist imagery" (by the author or the editors?) and left at that. While the texts may well be racist, it is difficult to dis- cern how these images necessarily are. They are certainly stylized after a '30s idiom, and African physiognomies and anatomy are exaggerated, in one case to the point of lewd absurdity; but so are many of the figures in the Haitian paintings and other art we are given to appreciate in these pages, witness Francois Cauvin's portrait of "Ezili/Generosite" as a large-lipped, bulging-breasted torso lactating over a spotted heart to the burst of fireworks seen through what appears to be a cloud of swimming sperm (p. 160). So it's OK for Them, but not for Us? Like American use of the "N-word," perhaps? Such duplicity gets us nowhere. One might contrast Hurbon's piece with that of Elizabeth McAlister, to see just how steep the climb can be. She begins tamely enough, with gentle musings about a bottle she purchased from a "sorcerer" during a graduate-student research project in Haiti. The bottle is fitted with two pairs of upturned open scissors, four mirrors, large magnets around the neck, and a red-white-and-black cloth covering. When she realizes that it is charged with shavings from two "zonbi" skulls, the equation shifts. "Zonbi, in Haiti, is a loaded word with many meanings and implications. Technically, a zonbi is a part of the soul that is stolen and made to work. The living-dead zombies that we think of from horror films are rare, and create a national sensation when they surface" (p. 314). Here she offers a footnote about such a case, from the popular press. One is left to wonder, as might Hurbon, whether "living-dead zom- bies" existed at all before Haitians saw them in American horror films, and then updated their imagery and praxis to match, as this book documents so many different times (e.g., Darth Vadar as the Bawon Samdi, p. 302). One is left wondering what to think of some of McAlister's further assertions about the "liv- ing grave" in her bottle (p. 312) and, indeed, about some of the art exhibited in the pages of Sacred Arts. I must admit that things like the figure of "Sisya bearing a skull" (p. 166) strike me as very nasty stuff, terrifyingly aggressive and meant to be so.6 So where are the "stereo- types"? That this question is left dangling is the most disturbing part of the entire Sacred Arts program. Fortunately, there is a great deal here that mitigates any distress over such an issue. I have only reviewed half of this huge book. (At nearly five pounds, it demands its own spe- cial ways of reading: no one-handing this one, with the other hand in a box of chocolates!) The other half is full of material to which I cannot do justice in the space remaining for this review. Some of the best moments in the entire volume are the idle chats and ardent exegeses with and by Vodou artists and prac- titioners, as recounted by Karen McCarthy Brown, Marilyn Houlberg, Tina Girouard, and Randall Morris. The indomitable mambo Mama Lola shines once again in Brown's text, positively radiat- ing wisdom and warmth. Interestingly, Mama Lola has traveled to Benin to visit Daagbo Hounon, a grand master of Vodun (p. 231); the Haiti/Benin circle closes, as Hounon has also come to visit New York. Brown also gives us a glimpse of someone nicknamed "Ti- Klou," after a nail-shaped scar on her temple, who has loved, wishes to lose, and then, hav- african arts spring 1996 93 93 african arts * spring 1996</page><page sequence="4">ing changed her mind, yearns to regain the affections of a mean man named Hubert. Through this fine case study, we are afforded the opportunity to participate vicariously in Vodou's power to transform, as it assists peo- ple to cope with circumstances beyond their ken. Did Ti-Klou get Hubert back, though? We are told that "everything is going to be all right" (p. 222), but we never find out. Marilyn Houlberg revisits the question of twins that she has studied for years now, offering us an intimately participatory view of Haitian rituals "feasting the twins" to share in their exceptional powers. Houlberg and Cosentino originated Sacred Arts with Doran Ross, who rightly attributes to her "rare sensi- bilities as a consummate accumulator" (p. x) some substantial portion of the project's suc- cess. These same sensibilities are manifest in her interview with Georges Rene, who is "mystically married" to "two Goddesses of Love," Ezili Freda and Ezili Dant6 (p. 287). The ideas and practices of Vodou come alive in this young man's words. Sequined banners, bottles, and other regalia play such important roles in Vodou that two articles are dedicated to them, one a history of sacred flags by Patrick Polk, the other a discussion of the evolution of sequined arts through the lives of a number of Haitian artists, presented by Tina Girouard. Polk demonstrates the link between Vodou banners and French military standards, and details the militaristic imagery that underlies the transformative struggles of Vodou ritual. Girouard is herself an accomplished sequin artist. Especially interesting is her presenta- tion of the iconographical changes that have occurred as Vodou banners have moved from the peristyle to "ethnic-chic" galleries. Be- tween the two chapters is an eight-page inter- leaf fairly shimmering with flags from the "Sacred Arts" exhibition. The last piece concentrating on particular art forms is dedicated to Georges Liautaud (1899-1991), the great ironsmith who revolu- tionized Haitian art with his crosses, cut-outs, and stand-up figures. Randall Morris knew Liautaud well, and presents his oeuvre with a sensitivity and grace befitting the grand old man. Liautaud made a "courageous attempt to bring into the realm of the tangible that [which was] never before visualized" (p. 389), and his sculptures of people on the verge of becoming possessed by Iwa Danbala (pp. 390-91) are extraordinarily cathartic. While sculpture cut from recycled barrels is now a fixture of Haitian tourist art, Liautaud's works were charged with spiritual presence (p. 393)-not only visually engaging, but actively so. There is much, much more to Sacred Arts, and as with any great book, there are a few minor shortcomings. Why there is no index is beyond me. Any book needs one, and a fat one like this needs one even more than that! In several cases, intriguing objects are not suffi- ciently explained in either caption or text (e.g., pp. 172-73). These are quibbles, of course, compared to the astounding achievements of the book. There remain two last, related matters to mention, not as criticism, since no book (even a five-pounder) can do and be everything every reader would wish, but as areas to be addressed down the line by writers who have been stimulated by the bounty of Sacred Arts. Assemblage is the predominant aesthetic of Vodou, as the authors describe so well, in terms of both the content and history of both particular elements and entire altar installa- tions. Aside from Cosentino's brief mention of the elements as "found objects" (p. 28)-a Surrealist reference he does not follow up; Mintz and Trouillot's discussion of culture- building; and Beauvoir-Dominique's presen- tation of the "imbricated progression" from one element to the next (p. 167); for the most part, the authors' approach to accumulation is descriptive. How does it work, though? How does it achieve its efficacy? Answers might be found by developing the analogy between Vodou and the objets trouves of Surrealism that appears but as quickly disappears several times in these pages, or by considering the deeply structured semantics of accumulation and display. One might focus upon the cat- achresis and irony at play, as meaning is stretched till it shrieks. As it does, Haitians find energy in assemblage that Yoruba sages might recognize as ase.7 Is something similar occurring in Vodou? A related question arises from Cosentino's discussion of "Vodou in the Age of Mechan- ical Reproductions" (p. 250), a title drawn to echo Walter Benjamin (1969). Although they are available in ever greater profusion, Cosentino aptly notes that "far from being peripheral, chromolithographs constitute the single most important contemporary source for the elaboration of Ogou theology" (p. 253). "Their commonness does not render them common, nor their ubiquity vulgar. Rather their availability is a sort of miracle, a proof of the divine presence encoded in the mysteries of lithography" (p. 247). Interpretation of these images may be "centripetal, pushing out new forms like a jazz riff" (p. 255), but how so? Again, the "miracle...of the divine presence encoded in the mysteries of lithog- raphy" deserves pushing farther than it has been here, perhaps by using and extending Benjamin's sense of the "aura" that inheres in art, as David Freedberg (1989) begins to do. I would suggest that aspects of the lithos are recognized as "found objects," revealing hidden truths (perhaps purposely hidden, if one gives this a political spin) and access to the Marvelous.8 Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou achieves a great deal, and as any great book does, it opens and leaves ajar many a door. If the authors' scholarship is stunning, it is because their subject matter is. Setting aside the "liv- ing-dead zombies" and other problematic issues which, as several authors note, may not be a part of Vodou proper, as it is defined by Haitians themselves, we are left with the sense of Vodou as a richly complex system of thought and praxis that helps Haitians cope with, overcome, and, indeed, deny their all- too-often hideously oppressive circum- stances. In the uplifting thoughts of the artist Andre Pierre, "Vodou allows you to walk with your head held high" in this meanest of worlds, for "the spirits of Vodou are the limbs of God" (p. xx). "Vodounnnnnnn....a wind that cannot be uprooted."

Reviewed by Brenda Danilowitz If the devil truly is in the details, then I Was Lonelyness: The Complete Graphic Works of John Muafangejo has faced that devil head on. Orde Levinson, who compiled this 427-page tome (and who is also founder of the John Muafangejo Foundation and project director of The Hope and Optimism Portfolio) has left very few stones unturned in this painstaking- ly assembled chronicle of the work of the sin- gular Namibian artist John Muafangejo, who died in 1987 just when recognition of his work was increasing. A monumental effort to cover all bases-and perhaps preempt the raising of some questions-the book represents the most complete treatment I know of the work of any African artist. The catalogue is large in format and pre- sented in a slipcase. Its striking graphic de- sign uses blow-ups of details of Muafangejo's prints as decorative elements. Extensive edi- torial notes, 6 essays, 20 pages devoted to interviews with the artist, 2 indexes of works (one of them listing incorrect or alternative titles), and a bibliography of over 500 entries accompany the 261 catalogued linocuts, woodcuts, and etchings. There is a foreword by Archbishop Desmond Tutu (himself the subject of one of Muafangejo's linocuts); as well as reproductions of the artist's various signatures; lists of works in public collec- tions, exhibitions, and awards; English trans- lations of texts that appear in the prints in the artist's native Oshikwanyama; and a note on printers and publishers. Since, apart from the two posthumous portfolios published by none other than Levinson himself, Muafan- gejo made all his own prints, this latter is a good example of the book's-or Levinson's- tendency toward overkill in the documenta- tion department. 94 african arts * spring 1996 94 african arts * spring 1996</page><page sequence="5">demonstrated. Mako must be understood within this philo- sophical grid of human relations-social and individual aspi- rations which sometimes are antagonistic and sometimes inci- dentally overlap. For example, while sexual intercourse is a dunko (translated here as "selfish pleasure"), its outcome is a mako (need) both physiological and social. What is mako for one person, group, or association can be dunko and sako for others. Following the discussions of mako, sako and dunko above, I dis- agree with the author's generalization that Bamana sculpture functions as a control mechanism or "medicine" for human fer- tility. It is erroneous to think of these "things that arrange needs" as the "gynecologist's prescriptions of the Bamana world" (pp. 33,264, n. 24). Such an assumption supposes that all Bamana are under the influence of similar prescriptions; it denies the Bamana people individuality and individual agency. There are many ritual objects that have nothing to do with fertility, and many ritual experts elect not to have children at all because of the high energy they manipulate throughout their lives. 6. See pp. 280-81, n. 102 (interview with Kojugu Cissoko, 8/9/94, Questions-3, Book 15, pp. 62-63 of transcribed tapes). The author's translation of this passage is totally accurate. 7. Even in sanankunya (joking relationship), men do not men- tion the female sex organ. Besides, it is believed that using the word vagina will soon turn a man into a destitute person because of the nyama it carries when pronounced by a man. Male descendants of slaves may give themselves license to say the word. Other nyamakala men will do so very rarely. 8. It is true that someone who cannot restrain from sexual activ- ity will be called wulu (dog), but one word is not used as an euphemism for the other. Anybody who transgresses social rules, not necessarily sexual rules, can be called a dog. 9. Although it is not so these days, female jeli (bard) have been reported to be great four-string guitar players. Equally, among the nobility and blacksmiths, girls born on some Komo celebration days were initiated at birth and took part in some of the activities until around their first menstruation and after menopause. 10. The design of Samori ni toubabou keleyorb, or "the place where Samori fought the white man" pattern (p. 333, n. 27), is more a historical than a human representation. In fact, before that war this design used to be called koro ni ngelen keleyoro, or "the place where the earth iguana and the squirrel fought." 11. There are stories, however, of people digging ant heaps for grain in years of acute famine and returning an equal amount of grain to the same anthill at harvest. I have yet to meet any- one who admits having done this, but the idea is widespread in tales about hunger. ROBERTS (Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou): Notes, from page 94 1. The sentences ending this paragraph are drawn from the con- clusion to Roberts 1996, in which the conceptually similar eclec- ticism of certain Beninese shrines to Ogun is discussed. One would think that Surrealists would have deeply appreciated the parallels between their own quest for the Marvelous and aes- thetics of the African Americas. However, when the Cuban artist Wilfredo Lam created an altar titled "La Chevelure de Falmer" for the 1947 International Exposition of Surrealism in Paris, combining Surrealist imagery with objects from New World Yoruba altars, few understood the cross-cultural com- plexity of reference. The installation was explained (or dis- missed?) as esoteric Lautreamontian juxtaposition (Galbe 1994). 2. As someone fluent in standard French, I was often perplexed by the editors' phonetic spelling of words like "kalfou" (car- refour, or "crossroads"), "pwen" (point-is the n of pwen pro- nounced as in English, or does it retain the peculiarly French twist at the end?), and "dechoukaj" ("uprooting"-is this somehow derived from decrochage?). I wish words had been presented in both forms, at least in the glossary, where etymol- ogy might have been explored. The editors' choice not to do this may increase the chances of misrepresenting descriptive phrases as stand-alone categorical nouns, for instance. Does the avoidance of standard French, thus making the phrase more exotic than it might be to many readers, as in "lwa erite (inherited spirits)" (in French, loa herites) and "Iwa achte (bought gods)" (loa achetes) (p. 131), reify a heuristic phrase, transforming it into an "insider's category" that subsequent scholars will cite? I am reminded of that central Africanist's bete noir, "Pre-Bembe Hunters," heuristically introduced by Daniel Biebuyck and now repeatedly cited as an actual ethnic and aesthetic distinction. 3. It doesn't happen often, but Cosentino's insouciance some- times does leave this reader a bit cold, as with his analogy between the clan of spirits related to the Bawon (Baron Samedi) and "the Addams family" (p. 402). 4. "Culture-building" is a phrase that I believe was coined by Robert Blauner (Caulfield 1972). It is useful for understanding the adaptive processes of people seeking to cope with life in con- temporary urban Africa, often through recycling and related activities of the informal economic sector; see Roberts 1992,1996. 5. For example, Beauvoir-Dominique asserts that "the logic of accumulation precedes that of analogy," when I would say that the logic through which one recognizes that something is "accu- mulation" functions by analogy. 6. I have been trying to think what a Tabwa person from south- eastern Zaire (the group among whom I conducted 45 months of predoctoral research in the mid-1970s) might think of such objects. Tabwa, too, have an instrumental religion, and their magic possesses all the ambiguities of Haitian magic. I have written of Tabwa magical bundles that contain human relics, such as one finds among other Bantu-speaking peoples, includ- ing their "cousins" of the Kongo congeries. Tabwa always con- sider these to be suspect as sorcery for nefarious use.

"Evil lurks in the hearts of men," as The Shadow cackled, and one must suspect that at least some of the Haitian individuals making and using these charged power points are up to no good. Others, though, may be seeking to "give fear a face," to resolve their own terrors through visual devices in ways found in certain African art (Roberts 1995:91-93). Certainly Haitians have had more than their share of terrors to confront over the centuries, which they may have sought to contextualize and master by a theater of death. Yet, opposition to Vodou by Haitian elites, local Protestants, American right-wing politi- cians, and others in part may be based on shudders similar to those Tabwa might feel, and the substance and context for such opposition are far too complex to dismiss as "simply" bigoted. I am reminded of Malinowski's call (1938/1965), still ignored by most, to produce a "total" ethnography of Africa that would include studies of missionaries, administrators, and Africans. Such a holistic perspective could be usefully applied to Haitian Vodou as well. 7.
