<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXVI, No. 4 (April, 1986) 379-81 WINSTON-DILLON'S TWO TREATISES OF PHILO* THE TWO WORKS by Philo of Alexandria with which this volume is concerned are relatively brief. Yet they articulate forcefully his profound Jewish piety, his heavy investment in Platonism, his hostility to myth and anthropomorphic religion, his theory of levels of meaning in Scripture, and his concepts of conscience, free will, and spiritual self-discipline. The two treatises, De Gigantibus and Quod Deus Sit Immutabilis (hereafter Gig. and Deus), are closely related items in Philo's multi-treatise Allegorical Commentary on the Pentateuch and together deal with Gen. 6:1-12. In a certain loose sense this important contribution to Philonic scholarship belongs to the genre of "commentary by committee." It actually consists of two commentaries on Philo's treatises, together with a set of articles dealing with related topics. Given the subtlety of Philo's thought and the rich diversity of the religious, philosophical, and cultural traditions behind him, a team approach to the study of his works can be, and here is, highly advantageous. The core of the book is a 127-page commentary on the two treatises by John Dillon and David Winston, probably the best guides in the world today into the intricate questions concerning the place of Philo to the history of ancient philos- ophy. They divided up the sections of the Philonic texts between them, wrote commentary drafts separately, examined and discussed each other's work, and then revised their efforts. The final fruit of this collaboration is a smoothly written commentary that pays particular heed to the philosophical ideas and terms in Philo's treatises and their relation to earlier and later philosophers. Winston and Dillon agree that Philo's philosophical orientation is best identified as Middle Platonist. Readers desiring to know more about the positions of these scholars may wish to consult particularly Winston's Philo of Alexandria: The Contempla- tive Life, the Giants, and Selections (1981) and Dillon's The Middle Platonists (1977). After finishing their basic commentary, Winston and Dillon shared the results with several other scholars. Valentin Nikiprowetzky was moved to respond with a 70-page commentary of his own, which prompted Winston and Dillon not only to make further revisions in their own work but also to include Nikiprowetzky's commentary in their book. Whereas Dillon and Winston's commentary focuses on philosophical ideas, Nikiprowetzky's emphasizes the treatises' internal struc- ture, which, he contends, is essentially a presentation of fourteen exegetical ques- tions and answers. Nikiprowetzky concludes by offering a general discussion of * Winston, David, and John Dillon: Two Treatises of Philo of Alexandria: A Commentary on De Gigantibus and Quod Deus Sit Immutabilis (Brown Judaic Studies, 25).

He maintains that Philo is, after all, a lucid and well organized author who uses allegory both as an apologetic device and as a tool for spiritual and philosophical discovery. Hence, despite some repetitions, the commentaries of Winston-Dillon and Nikiprowetzky really complement each other. Nikiprowetzky's tragic death in 1983 ended the career of one of the world's leading Philonists. The articles that form the rest of the introduction to the Winston-Dillon com- mentary touch on a variety of topics. Dillon writes about the formal structure of Philo's allegorical exegesis (he suggests that it resembles particularly the structure of Neoplatonic commentaries on Plato) and about Philo's teachings on the angels and on the nature of God. An essay by Winston argues well (mainly against Wolfson) that Philo credited humans with relative rather than absolute freedom of the will. David Gooding and Nikiprowetzky comment on Philo's text (Philo used the LXX; some of his Biblical quotations were changed by a third century Jew to agree with Aquila, which intriguingly attests some continued Jewish interest in Philo's corpus). John Leopold discusses Philo's knowledge of rhetorical theory, his rich vocabulary, the hellenistic tradition of using allegory to conceal the message and to inspire awe, and the main stylistic features in Gig. and Deus. Thomas Conley contributes a brief essay which argues that the meaning of topoi in ancient rhetoric and especially in Philo is multifaceted but never reducible simply to "cliches." Richard Wallis argues that Philo's statements about conscience are original mainly in representing it as a divine gift, and he finds late Stoicism close in spirit to Philo. Both Wallis and Dillon engage in some speculation about what Philo really meant but failed to say (or should have meant, if only he had been more concerned with philosophical consistency). The volume is very important for several reasons. Philosophically, it offers some important steps beyond the magisterial work of Harry Wolfson. The essays on rhetoric and the structural comments of Nikiprowetzky point toward new frontiers in applying rhetorical and literary criticism to Philo. The Winston- Dillon and Nikiprowetzky commentaries, taken together, are now the fullest analyses of these Philonic treatises that we have, although the annotated edition of A. Moses in Les Oeuvres de Philon d'Alexandrie (1963) will continue to be useful. The writers consistently demonstrate their familiarity with the history of Philonic scholarship. The book concludes with a fine bibliography and a full set of indices. On the negative side, several of the introductory essays are too brief to be more than suggestive. The price paid for team authorship is evident not only in some differences of opinion but also in the fact that certain issues are not treated: no single individual sat down and decided what had to be done to offer a compre- hensive interpretation from his or her viewpoint. The New Testament is mentioned only occasionally, although numerous images and themes in these treatises have apparent parallels there. In particular, it would have been helpful to have some</page><page sequence="3">WINSTON-DILLON'S PHILO HAY 381 comparison of Philo's statements about conscience, sin, grace, and his dualistic categorization of good and bad persons with the teachings of that other celebrated 1st century hellenistic Jew, Paul of Tarsus. All things considered, this splendid volume sets a new high standard in com- mentary on Philo's commentaries, and we can only hope that it will inspire imitation. Coe College DAVID M.
