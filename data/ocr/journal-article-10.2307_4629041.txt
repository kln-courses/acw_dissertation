<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "WADE CUP" IN THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART, ITS ORIGIN AND DECORATIONS BY RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN* OWING TO THE ACTIVE INTEREST OF THE CLEVE- land Museum, students and admirers of Near Eastern metalwork recently welcomed a new publication in this all too rarely investigated field, a monograph by D. S. Rice on an unusual inlaid footed bowl in that institution.' This * Thanks are due Dr. D. S. Rice for his permission to reproduce here a number of illustrations from his publications and for his comments on an early draft of this paper. Mr. Stuart C. Welch, Jr., kindly allowed me to reproduce his metal tray and his sketch of a motif on it. I would also like to thank the authorities of the Kabul and Teheran Museums, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Walters Art Gallery, and the Freer Gallery of Art, and the officers of the Kevorkian Foun- dation, for granting publication rights for objects in their care. I am also greatly obliged to Prof. Mario Bussagli and the Istituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente in Rome, the Heeramaneck Galleries in New York, Mr. Wilhelm Henrich, Frankfurt on Main, Mr. Ahmad Ali Kohzad, Director of the Museum of Kabul, Mr. M. T. Mostafavi, Director of Antiquities of Iran, and to Mr. K. Rabenou and Mr. E. Safani of New York, who were good enough to provide photo- graphs or to permit the publication of those taken by me. Finally, I am indebted to my wife for the photo- graphs of figures IO, 14, 23, 32, and 37, to Mr. Rostamy of the Teheran Museum for that of figure 22, to Mr. Raymond A. Schwartz of the Freer Gallery of Art for those of figures 15-I7, 2I, 24, 29, and 30, and to Miss Eleanor Morsell, who made the drawings used for text fiaures E. I-L, and S.

The following was originally started as a review of this book, but it soon became apparent that in view of its length, range, and the necessity of introducing so many unknown objects, it would have to go well beyond the normal limits of this type of writing. Inasmuch as this literary genre makes it possible, however, to point out Dr. Rice's new and valuable contributions and in addition to present ideas which are complementary to or different from his, the form of a book review has beautifully illustrated study enriches our knowl- edge because of the scholarly discussion not only of its main subject but also of other newly dis- covered or little-known pieces related to it. In including such comparative material this book surpasses in stature and usefulness the same author's Le Baptistere de Saint Louis (published in similar form in I95I) which presented analo- gous methodological problems yet did not go beyond the discussion of a single object. This new contribution to our knowledge of Islamic metalwork is therefore unusually stimulating. However, in as difficult a subject as this branch of Muslim art, and with so many of its objects, widely dispersed over four continents, there are bound to be points of further discussion. Some- times they will be based on a somewhat dif- ferent interpretation of the same sparse ma- terial, which resembles the parts of a large jigsaw puzzle of which most of the pieces are missing; quite naturally at times different ideas suggest themselves as to how these pieces should be grouped. But more often there are instances where these pieces appear in a new light, because of other so far unpublished artifacts which should also be considered. In view of the prominent position the inlaid cup in the Cleve- land Museum will assume from now on, owing to its intrinsic significance and the new monograph devoted to it, such a discussion will, it is hoped, be helpful in elucidating some of the problems connected with the flowering of Persian metal- work around the year I2oo. In any case this new survey will lay special stress on the de- to a certain degree been adopted for this article. The official designations "cup" and "Wade Cup" have been kept throughout, but the shape will be discussed on p. 366.</page><page sequence="2">328 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN velopment of the pertinent shapes and decora- tions used in the periods preceding the Wade Cup, thus supplementing Dr. Rice's publica- tion, which deals mostly with contemporary and later pieces. I. D. S. RICE'S DISCUSSION OF THE WADE CUP. To acquaint the reader with the issues in- volved we will first follow Dr. Rice's presenta- tion of the Wade Cup and of the pieces related to it and then proceed to analyze the major problems for which another interpretation will be given. At this point it should be stressed that the wide scope of such a discussion is to a not inconsiderable degree due to Dr. Rice, since in past years he has, by his various publications, greatly increased our knowledge of mediaeval Muslim metalwork. After a short introduction dealing briefly with the rise and development of inlaid metalwork in the Islamic world and pointing to the great sig- nificance of mediaeval metalwork for our knowl- edge of Muslim iconography, Dr. Rice gives in his first chapter a lengthy description of the "Wade Cup," an unsigned, almost globular stemmed vessel, ioi inches high, which was first briefly described and illustrated in the catalogue of the metal exhibition in Ann Arbor in I943 and which since then has entered the Cleveland Museum of Art as a gift from the late J. H. Wade (figs. i and 2). The two parts of the vessel, the bowl and the foot, were cast as one unit with only the bottom of the upper part being inserted separately. The piece is very richly decorated with silver inlay (now partly lost) and traced design, especially on the outer surface. The latter shows, below a border with an "animated" inscription expressing a series of good wishes, an elaborate decor of which the organizing element is provided by bands swathed around the body of the vessel. The major triangular and lozenge-shaped interstices be- tween these bands are filled with the signs of the zodiac. The bands themselves show proces- sions of animals, real and imaginary, not mixed and pursuing each other, but in most cases the same animal repeated within the same unit, although, it should be pointed out, we find also, for instance, a bearded sphinx leading a moon- faced female of the same species. The foot has a narrow band of naskhi writing ending in human heads containing a brief formula of good wishes, the whole bordered on top and bottom by tassel-like leaves pointing up and down re- spectively. The inside of the cup shows on the bottom four sphinxes, whose connected wings are interlaced with a knot-like design; these animals are revolving clockwise around a cen- tral point (text fig. A). They are surrounded by w~~~~~~ FIG. A- DESIGN OF FOUR SPHINXES IN INTERIOR OF WADE CUP. (Drawn by D. S. Rice, after The Wade Cup in the Cleveland Museum of Art.) a double row of fishes moving counterclockwise, with parts of other fishes visible along the edges. There are small figures of other animals, par- ticularly birds, between the two main rows of fishes, mostly moving in the same direction as the sphinxes. The central design is framed by I2 stalks radiating from the center, each car- rying a lemon-shaped motif with a finial. Final- ly there is a continuous frieze in Kufic along the</page><page sequence="3">THE WADE CUP 329 edge of the cup's interior; in the monograph it is said to consist only of a repetition of the single word wal-barakah, "and blessing" but curiously enough, besides one incomplete version, it con- tains also, once, the word wal-daw(l)ah, "and government" (with the letter lIm missing). In the second chapter Dr. Rice first presents his ideas about the origin of the cup's peculiar form, which he regards as the rendering of a pottery shape in metal. He then points out that the shape of the Wade Cup is not an isolated example and goes on to discuss briefly another outstanding piece, the "Vaso Vescovali" now in the British Museum, which alone of this group has a lid (fig. 9).2 Another example il- lustrated is a footed cup in the Metropolitan Museum, while a vessel in the Victoria and Albert Museum with arabesque designs is only referred to. A fifth vessel, formerly in the Peytel Collection, is much simpler, its only decoration being a historical inscription, whose visible part on the only available photograph was read by Dr. Rice (fig. 5). An interpretation of its text leads him to regard it as "probably mid- fourteenth-century work from Khorasan" (pp. I3, I6). He also discusses a second group of differently made cups whose taller pedestals have annular knops. This group comprises ves- sels in the Pinacoteca in Naples, in the Museo Nazionale in Florence, and the Walters Art Gallery, all from Persia, and then finally the "Fano Cup" in the Bibliotheque Nationale which now has a base from another piece at- tached to it. This last-named piece is attributed by Rice to Syria and the Ayyiibid period. Here this writer would like to call attention to two other stem cups which belong to the first group. On the first, of yellowish brass, in the Metro- politan Museum (No. 9I.I.542), there is an all- 2 After having been published more than a hundred years ago by M. A. Lanci, this piece has now been made the subject of an article by Ralph Pinder-Wilson on the occasion of its recent acquisition by the British Museum (An Islamic bronze bowl, British Museum Quarterly, vol. i6 [I95I], pp. 85-87). over silver-inlaid leafy design, which surrounds two staggered rows of undecorated roundels on its bowl part. On the second piece, which once belonged to the late Joseph Brummer in New York and whose present whereabouts is un- known to this writer, roundels with seated figures are set against a background with an all-over design of interlocking swastikas which is bordered on top by an inscription band with good wishes in the form of a naskhi inscription placed on arabesques.3 To judge from its rather dry design this piece, like the one just referred to, in the Metropolitan Museum, could date from the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century. These tentative dates can, however, only be verified when proper photographs are available; for the time being these pieces are mentioned here mainly to help to establish the full range of this particular group. In the monograph's second chaper it is em- phasized that the revolving sphinxes in the interior of the Wade Cup have close parallels on the large basin in the Volkerkunde Museum in Munich (text fig. B), which was made by order of Badr al-Din Lu'lu' of Mosul (I233-59), and on a tray bearing the title of the same ruler in the Victoria and Albert Museum. To establish a more precise date and provenance Dr. Rice turns, in two succeeding chapters, to an analysis of the two main decorative features of the Wade Cup. In chapter three he analyses the designs of the zodiac, hereby mainly following the in- vestigations of Willy Hartner. These symbols present themselves as the various domicilia of the seven main planets, and of the pseudo- planetary nodes of the moon's orbit, although this "mixed" system shows a few deviations from the norm, which are duly noted.

More promising appears to be an analysis of the elaborate naskhi inscription expressing good wishes below the rim, since its peculiar amalgam- ation of the letters with human figures and ani- mals is not only regarded as a clever transfor- mation of the Arabic alphabet but also as a clue to its date and, through it, to its place of origin. Here Dr. Rice's drawings of details serve a particularly useful purpose, as he was able to assemble the inscriptions from the pieces so far discussed, and in addition those on other objects of different shapes and functions. Dr. Rice starts his historical survey of these specific examples by differentiating between three varieties of this script, for which Mme. V. Kratchkovskaya's all-embracing term "figural" is probably the best. The first he designates as the "animated" naskhl, as the upper hastae are formed of human being's engaged in various activities, while some or all of the lower letters are composed of animal parts. The two ex- amples of this group, and both of them are ingenious and most appealing, are on the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63 (559 H.) in the Hermitage Museum, and the Wade Cup itself (text fig. C). In the second variety the hastae of the letters-and they can be either Kulfic or naskhl--are "human-headed." In the third variety animals appear as fillers between the letters of the naskhi writing without being fused with the script itself. In the course of his survey Dr. Rice provides readings of some inscriptions in these various forms of figural writing. They are a testimony to his ability as an epigraphist, because they prove in many instances to be real riddles, especially in the later versions, when the letters are more or less submerged in the heavy growth of figural decoration. The reading of the inscription on the Wade Cup is, by comparison, fairly easy.4 4 Dr. Rice renders this inscrip tion (text fig. C) as follows: ;.*C.JIp (e) zA)"J1, (d) 1_9 (c) JL.Y 1i (b) j-...Jt (a) JU-1 (k) s)J1.pQ1 (j) ;UtA. , (i) ;..J 1s9(h) ,-JI1 (g) Zl ,11 (f) .J (p) g*: (o) LzUj (n) kUJI, (m) 6LAsQ1. (1) "Glory and success, and government, and bliss, and soundness, and peace of mind, and mercy, and well- being, and good health, and duration, and increase, and satisfaction, and care, and continuance to its owner." This seems fully justified, except that the misspelled (o) "always" is not translated; also the writing of the seventh word (g), said to be wal-rahmah, might allow another reading. In all the other examples the letter mim is either given as a loop (in e, j, and o) or shows (in h) a thickening of the line, neither of which is found in g. Furthermore, the letter which is read as ha is higher and steeper and does not show the acute angular form which is found in the words (f) and (p). It seems to this writer more likely, therefore, that the fish held in the duck's bill does not form part of the letter, so that the word in question should be rendered as ,11 9. If we apply diacritical points to it, wal-zinah, "beauty, ornament," would be a solution, since such a reading was listed by E. Mittwoch, after a piece published by M. Lanci (E.

(After drawing by D. S. Rice.)</page><page sequence="6">332 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN Based on the analysis of these figural in- scriptions, Dr. Rice finally places the Wade Cup after the pen case in the Freer Gallery, dated I2IO (though without giving the reasons why he does so), and before the Blacas Ewer in the British Museum, dated 1232, or, as he also states, into the third decade of the thirteenth century. Since Herat was sacked by the Mongols in I222, he attributes the cup to the other great center of metalworking, Azerbaijan, or a region near the Caucasus. He does not refer to contemporary examples which would relate the Wade Cup to other pieces from this region. Instead his sup- porting evidence is (i) two close parallels for the wheel with four sphinxes on the cup's interior, which occur on the basin and tray of Badr al- Din Lu'lu' made in Mosul, and a less close parallel of four revolving lions on a stone carving from Daghestan, attributed to the late twelfth or early thirteenth century; (2) the style of the text on the cup's stem, which appears in the same manner on the sockets of northwest Persian candlesticks from the end of the century or the beginning of the next; and (3) the grayish- green tinge of the cup's alloy, which Rice no- ticed also on the later candlesticks. When evaluating this evidence, of which the first seems to be the decisive one for Dr. Rice, it should be borne in mind that it is either from a different region or, when referring to the same region, at least 50 years after the making of the Wade Cup. In either case it is from a period when the mi- gration of craftsmen as a result of the Mongol invasion had greatly changed the artistic landscape of the Near East. II. THE EARLIEST ISLAMIC INLAID METALWORK After this analysis of Rice's monograph, which indicates the wealth of information con- Berlin, I906, p. 77; Lanci's publication is, however, not available to me for a further check). Another suggestion was made by Harold W. Glidden, who reads the word as wal-rutbah, "rank, dignity." This would fit the general tenor of the inscription better than wal-zinah. tained in it, we turn now to a discussion of certain issues. We are starting with one of general nature, which is of great significance for the history of Near Eastern metalwork. It seems certain to this writer that the statement in the Introduction, that "all the early vessels pro- duced in the Near East in the first four and a half centuries of Islamic rule are either plain or decorated with traced designs only" (p. 7), can no longer be maintained. There are a few brass vessels usually designated as post-Sasanian which are inlaid with copper. Although their precise date has so far not been established, so much is certain, that they are pre-Seljuq and therefore constitute definite proof that inlay work in bronze or brass was practiced in the early centuries of Islamic Iran.5 In any case they are much older than the pen case of II48 in the Hermitage, which is called "the first example of an inlaid Islamic metal work." To this already published material can now be ad- ded another item: Several years ago this writer saw, in the little Museum of Herat, a Persian bronze ewer of a shape derived from a Sasanian prototype (fig. 36). On its body below the spout a short inscription in simple unadorned Kilfic FIG. D-SILVER INLAID INSCRIPTION ON BRONZE EWER IN THE HERAT MUSEUM (SEE PLATE FIG. 36).

D). For epigraphic reasons this inlay can be dated from the last two decades of the third to the first half of the fourth century H. (end of the ninth to the middle of the tenth century A.D.).6 6 On my visit to Herat in I95I I got, unfortunately, only a glimpse of this piece one evening, but hoped to come back to it the next day to study it more exten- sively and photograph it. The conditions of travel, however, made this impossible and two subsequent tries proved unsuccessful. Thanks to the kind help of Pere Serge de Beaurecueil, 0. P., M. Abdulghafour Rawan Farhadi, and M. Fikri Seldjouki I am now happily able to present two illustrations of this im- portant piece. As to the copy of the inscription, Pere de Beaurecueil stated in a letter: "La reproduction est parfaite." M. Fikri Seldjouki indicated by outline drawing those parts of the inscription from which the inlaid silver had fallen out. According to this same Afghan scholar, the thickness of the line is about I mm., the height of the inscription about 8 mm., and its length 49 mm. The most revealing epigraphic feature as to the date of the early unadorned Kfific is the descending rounded ligature between two letters found in two places, the rounded swelling of several lower letters and, to a very limited extent, the one 'ayn formed by two slanting lines coming to a point on the writing line, and with the top of the letter open. The earliest use of a connecting loop together with this special form of an 'ayn is on a dirham of al-Mu'tadid billah struck in Isfahan in 282 H./895 (H. Lavoix, Catalogue des monnaies musulmanes de la BibliothUque Nationale, Paris, I887-96, vol. i, No. I047, pI. 5). Dr. George C. Miles kindly informed me that he knows such a ligature on another dirham of this Abbasid caliph of 28x (mint effaced) in the collection of the American Numismatic Society, and that this feature occurs on other coins from 303 H./9I5 to 3I8 H./930. He also pointed out that it is found in the mid-fourth century H. in stone epigraphy and becomes common toward the end of that century. I have checked this information against inscriptions on tiraz fabrics made in the East. There it appears also first under al-Mu'tadid billah in 283 H./896, again under al-Muktafi billah (289-295 H./9o2-9o8), on a tiraz from Marv, then on various othertiraz cloths made in Bishapfir, Baghdad, and other unnamed places, up to atiraz of al-Muqtadir billah, dated 320 H./932. The specific swelling of the lower letters is found on a tiraz of this last-named caliph dated 3I6-3I8 H./928-930 (E. Kuhnel-L. Bel- III. THE ORIGIN OF THE SHAPE When discussing the origin of the stem cup, of which the piece in the Cleveland Museum is a distinguished example (p. i2), Dr. Rice first linger, Catalogue of dated tiraz fabrics, The Textile Museum, Washington, 1952, p. I4, No. 73.366; p. I9, No. 73.657; p. 20, No. 73.674; p. 27, No. 73.14; p. 28, No. 73.I7; p. 3I, Nos. 73.557 and 73.I9; p. 32, No. 73.368; p. 34, No. 73.369, and pls. VI, VIII, XII and XIII). This evidence shows that while this type of ligature occurred already in the eighties of the third century H., it became more common in the first three decades of the fourth century. In view of the swelling of the lower letters, a date of ca. 32o H./932 suggests itself, but there may be other tiraz fabrics which show this feature at an earlier date. There is one other approach to the problem of the date, namely, that of considering the name. It seems unlikely that this is the signature of the artisan, as it would most probably have been preceded by one of the usual fecit formulas. In view of this the name probably represents the owner. Since the name "Bakr" is not too common, there is a good chance of identifying such a person. One that fits in time would be the Dulafid Bakr b. 'Abd al-'Azlz b. Abi Dulaf al-Qasim, who died in 285 H./898 (E. de Zambaur, Manuel de genealogie et de chronologie, Hanovre, I927, p. I99). However, that family resided in Karaj in Kurdistan and one would still have to explain how this ewer came to Herat. Several possible theories suggest themselves, but it seems wiser at this point to leave this question of identification for the time being. Strictly speaking, our assumed date-end of the third or beginning of the fourth century H.-applies only to the inlaying, because this work could have been done on an earlier piece. To a certain extent this is suggested by the shape of the ewer which, owing to its " Sasanian" shape, one would have been inclined to date earlier than about A.D. goo. This question of whether this inlay work was applied to an old or a new vessel must remain in abeyance because we still do not know enough about the continuation of Sasan- ian forms in the first six centuries of the Hijrah and it will, furthermore, be necessary to examine the ewer in Herat in a thorough manner. It seems, however, significant that this piece appeared in the same town, Herat, from which we have about two and a half centuries later the first bronze vessel with silver and copper inlays carrying inscriptions which give, besides other information, the name of this very place and the date 559 H.</page><page sequence="8">334 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN points out that under the stimulation of Chinese pottery, Near Eastern ceramic craftsmen cre- ated a number of new shapes, one of which was a deep bowl "with gentle curved-in rims and a high splayed footring." The earliest of these pieces with a date so far tracked down is from the year 6oo H./12o3 (fig. 3). The Wade Cup would, according to Rice, "represent a render- ing of the same shape in metal" (p. I2) and "is unlikely to be earlier than this earliest dated pottery vessel of the shape," i.e., I203 (p. i6). As Dr. Rice is quite right in pointing out that the footed bowl seems to have gained a fairly recent popularity in metalwork at the time when the Wade Cup was made, the question of its antecedents is very important, especially since the genesis of this new type can possibly provide a clue for its date and point also to the region of its origin. Now as to the assumed dependence of the metal shape on the pottery-because it is this that "the rendering of the same shape (i.e., the shape used for pottery vessels) in metal" seems to imply-it can be stated that although there is a general resemblance between the pottery vessels referred to and others made of metal, the two betray also certain differences. This will become clear when we compare the profile of the "earliest" pottery piece, that of I203, with the Wade Cup (figs. I and 3). Not only is the outline of the pottery bowl with its more verti- cal upper part, which slightly inverts and then everts again to form the lip, different from the more unified outline of the metal vessel, but also the foot differs in both instances. In the ceramic ware we have, so to speak, a simple truncated cone, while the brass object shows a very specific curve, in which the foot flares slightly near its junction with the bowl, then contracts to flare out in a more pronounced fashion toward its lower edge. Mr. Arthur Lane has furthermore pointed out that the ceramic type is, for stylistic reasons, most likely to be earlier than I200, and he referred in particular to a fine vessel in the Victoria and Albert Museum which he dates about ii8o (fig. 4). The profile of this piece evidently differs also from that of the Wade Cup. Another aspect of the problem is the fact that although pottery vessels often imitate metal shapes, it happened only very rarely that a mediaeval Muslim metalworker copied a pottery shape, as he did, for instance, in the case of the cast brass bowl now in the Museo Civico in Bologna, which was made for an officer of Badr al-Din Lu'lu' between 123I and I259 ;7 but this piece never set a fashion and from all we know seems to have remained a unique creation. On the other hand, the footed metal bowl was a fairly popular type which in the course of time underwent an evolution of its own. It was indeed so popular that it in- fluenced potterywork, since the foot of a ce- ramic bowl in the Victoria and Albert Museum, dated 672 H./I274, with its flattened-out base (Rice, pl. XIV, a) has a typical metal shape and is in this respect different from the feet on early dated ceramic pieces (see fig. 3). Also, as Dr. Rice himself noted (p. I5), the idea of swathing the body of a globular vessel with decorative bands was imitated by a potter in 1270. The influencing, therefore, if there was any, might very well have gone in the opposite direction - that is, from metalwork to pottery, as seems to have happened in the second half of the thirteenth century.8 While Dr. Rice's hypothe- 7 We owe the discovery and apt publication of this piece to D. S. Rice (Studies in Islamic metalwork-III, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and Afican Studies, vol. 15 [I953], pp. 232-238). I think we should look for the prototype of this shape among the Raqqah pottery, where bowls of this type are common. As to the brass bowl's date, the original publication gives "between 121O and I259" (p. 238), which in Rice's Wade Cup is narrowed to "between I23I and 1259" (p. I2). 8 There are two other types of stem cups in pottery whose decoration and details of shape indicate that they must have been copied from, or at least inspired by, metal prototypes. One was in the Jacques Doucet Collection and was said to be from Raqqah (Sale Catalogue, Paris, I930, No. 90, pI. 22); the other, a dark-blue glazed cup with a single handle and an</page><page sequence="9">THE WADE CUP 335 sis of a pottery model is-in theory-not alto- gether impossible, the general and specific evi- dence makes it seem unlikely. This, in turn, naturally raises the question as to what should be regarded as the prototype of the new metal shape. There is in the Archaeological Museum in Teheran a stemmed cup found in Mazanderan which dates from the Sasanian (or possibly the E F G FIG. E-PROFILE OF VASO VESCOVALI. HEIGHT 2I7 mm. FIG.

Although the globular part is shallower than the Wade Cup and the foot higher, especially in relation to the upper part, there can be no doubt that this vessel is, so to speak, the Iranian ancestor of the piece in Cleveland. This is indicated by the general shape, the "waist" of the foot, and the compartmenting raised bands with interstitial designs. Recently another such early silver cup with a high and rather heavy foot has come to light. Its only decoration consists of narrow animal-on-arabesque frieze in relief on its upper part, has recently entered the Walters Art Gallery in Balti- more (No. 48.2075). flutings on the outside of the bowl part, but this feature is important, as it may be the prototype for the arches and gadrooning on the later footless and footed bowls (cf. text figs. H. and I and figs. 6 and i5). This new piece, which belongs to Mr. Rabenou in New York, has a Pahlavi inscription in the foot. Another possible prototype for a hemispheri- cal stem cup, even for the comple e type with a lid, is to be found in the Buddhist art of the Far East during the T'ang period, although in introducing such pieces we would have to consider not only the problem of a considerable time gap, but also of a large separating distance. The Chinese pieces have, however, so many features in common with the Iranian group, especially with the Vaso Vescovali (text fig. E), that a connection cannot be entirely disclaimed. The most important historical pieces are a set of seven bronze reliquaries in the famous Japanese Imperial Repository, the Shosoin in Nara, which as such cannot be later than the first half of the eighth century.

Their globular bowls are slightly more or less than hemispherical or about hemispherical; the lids of four pieces are crowned by a three-, five-, or seven-storied finial in pagoda form ending in a cintamani jewel, the whole top set on a base (text fig. F); in a fifth case we find on the lid only a large cintamani above two profiles (text fig. G), while the sixth and seventh carry a small single-tiered stupa with a cintamani. None of the pieces shows any decoration besides gilding and application of silver, or in one case inserts of green glass beads. Three pieces-the largest being 290 mm. high with a diameter of 75 mm.-were cast in two pieces, that is, as lid and bowl-foot units. The foot and the finial of the four others-among them the smallest piece measuring II5 X 73- were made separately and soldered on.9 In every instance the bowl's interior is rounded at the bottom and no piece has an insert as found in the Wade Cup and others of its group. Apart from this detail the main differences between the Far Eastern examples and the Vaso Vesco- vali are that the latter is by comparison broader both in its bowl part and foot, the latter is not set on a base, and the bowl and lid invert toward their juncture, while the curvature of these two parts remains the same in the Chinese pieces. In spite of these differences there is, however, something of a family resemblance between all these covered bowls. Besides the Shosoin reliquaries there is a similar, partially silvered bronze piece with an 8-tiered finial in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City.10 The Freer Gallery of Art also owns a most elaborately engraved silver-gilt 9 Shosoin gyomotsu zuroku (Illustrated catalogue of the Imperial treasures in the ShWsOin), Tokyo, Imperial Household Museum, I929, vol.

Finally a wooden and painted vessel with a 5-tiered finial was found by von Le Coq at Toyok in the Turfan region." In view of the fact that only two Sasanian examples of this general shape (although, at least now, coverless) have become known, while the Far Eastern examples are more common and furthermore have a ritual function, it seems quite likely that the shape is in Iran due to foreign influence, especially as the country bordered on Buddhist territory and had Bud- dhist inhabitants in its eastern regions. If this was so, it must have been the Far Eastern type with a shallow bowl which was copied in these two examples. What happened to the stem cup between the eighth and the twelfth centuries- that is, whether the Iranian types continued to exist or died out and had to be revived-is not known at present owing to our lack of infor- mation about early Islamic metalwork from Iran. The fact that the two Sasanian pieces with their raised bands or flutings foreshadow two later decorative schemes (see below p. 339) seems to suggest that the shape was continually used in Iran, though probably as a rarer type.'2 Be that as it may, the renewed interest in stem cups during the Middle Ages seems to have 11 A. von Le Coq, Chotscho, Berlin, I9I3, pL 6i, d. This reliquary has a scale pattern with floral design in red, green, yellow, and black on white (height 135 mm.; diam. 75 mm.) This piece demonstrates the westward movement of this shape. 12 In Basil Gray, The influence of Near Eastern metalwork on Chinese ceramics, Transactions of the Oriental Ceramic Society, vol. i8 (I940-4I), pp. 52-57, all the Western and Far Eastern examples quoted have a too-high stem to be useful in this discussion; they also do not help to elucidate the question of the origin of the second type of mediaeval Islamic stem cup (with knops) established by Dr. Rice. The (later) Far Eastern cups with a knop in the high stem are thought to have been influenced by western proto- types.</page><page sequence="11">THE WADE CUP 337 been brought about or at least stimulated by another development. The circumstances under which the stem cup was again made part of the general repertory of shapes can to a certain degree be recon- structed. If we study the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63 we find, first, that this object has basically a foot which in its general curvature is not too different from that of the Wade Cup, the major difference being that it is wider in proportion to the vessel. One could also point out that it does not flare out as much at the top as the foot of the Wade Cup does, although the difference is minimal. However, the general aspect of the foot in both instances is the same and so is the relation of foot to body. In this connection it should also be recalled that there are other buckets of this period which show varied width of the foot, while others are footless.3 When we now look at the topmost register of the bucket of II63 we find above the beginning of the word wal-dawlah (fig. I8) a globular bowl with a rather narrow splayed foot and above the central waiw a flat globular bowl without a foot. Similar shapes are found also in other places in this register and in the next. Although we do not know certainly of what material these ves- sels were made, we can nevertheless draw a few conclusions: First, at this time there existed vessels of the same form, either with a foot or without one; second, the shape of the foot is, in this period, wide, medium-sized, or narrow; and third, the introduction of a foot precedes the year 1203 and can be traced back at least to II63. Taking this clue, we will have to find globular vessels of a preceding period to which, in certain cases, at a particular moment, a foot was added. Such pieces exist among the little- known and not yet investigated Sama.nid or 13 R. Harari, Metalwork after the early Islamic period, in A survey of Persian art, ed. A. U. Pope, London and New York, 1938-39, vol. 6, pls. 1291, B, and I292, A; for such buckets with a foot, see ibid., pls. I292, B, I306, A, and I307. There are also jugs with or without a foot, cf. ibid., pls. I309, B, and I309, A, C, D. 22 Ghaznavid pieces of metalwork, or those from later periods, where we find hemispherical bowls of various sizes with a slightly drawn-in rim and slightly flattened at the bottom so as to allow them to be placed on a flat surface or on some kind of a stand.14 However, even the earliest of these pieces were probably not an original cre- ation of that period, since we have fine pieces of silver and gold of roughly the same globular shape without a foot which are probably Parthian and Bactrian.15 Nothing of that type has so far appeared among the Sasanian metal pieces, although round-bottomed vases are well known, but the type possibly existed and is probably also to be found among more lowly ceramic wares. There is also an unglazed, more or less globular bowl with a Kulfic inscription below the rim and floral decoration on the lower body, which was found in Susa and dates probably from the Umayyad period; but its rim does not turn in and it has a flat base, so it may be too much of a variant to be a link in the evolution.16 When the shape appears (or rather reappears) in spun or cast brass in the tenth-eleventh century, the pieces vary in size from very large to medium-sized bowls. Of the largest and best-preserved piece, which was found in Afghanistan and is now owned by the Kevor- kian Foundation in New York, so far only the in- terior has been illustrated before,17 so that we re- 14 For such a stand, see Survey, p1.

One might even be inclined to see in the geometric all-over design which develops from a 6-pointed star at the bowl's bottom a prefiguration of the swathing ribbons; be that as it may, we find here already the idea of crisscrossing bands and of placing the main ornamental units in the areas created by these FIG.

However, its much-worn interior shows, among other decorations, the signs of the zodiac,'8 which is yet another feature that a metal bowl of this type has in common with the Wade Cup (fig. I4).

It will also be noticed that, besides the usual I2 figures of the zodiac, there are three additional figures placed between Aries and Pisces.</page><page sequence="13">THE WADE CUP 339 geometric design with a Kific inscription and arabesques filling the interstices we find a plain gadrooned surface edged on top by a sequence of crescent-shaped arches with a hexagon substi- tuted for the 6-pointed star at the bottom (text fig. H).19 A fourth, still unpublished piece of the group, in the collection of the writer, is unepigraphic. Its outside shows, below various friezes with circular motifs and moldings, a series of high columned arches, the latter design being related to that found on the bowl of Abui Nasr Muhammad (fig. x5).20 The treatment of the exterior of a fifth bowl in the Teheran Museum is quite different from that of the pieces so far discussed (fig. 22). Here the artist who made the bowl not only created the usual globu- lar shape but also an elaborate dense deco- ration (in relief), which covers the whole surface of the object. In its horror vacui it resembles the Wade Cup. Other features in which these two pieces are related are the inscriptions containing good wishes below the rim, the delineation of areas to be decorated by bands or lines crossing 19 After Harari, op. cit., vol. 3, p. 2482, fig. 8ii, a. This bowl was formerly in the collections of Dr. F. R. Martin and Mr. Sidney Burney, then in the posses- sion of the late Joseph Brummer, and is now the property of the Kevorkian Foundation in New York. I remember having seen, many years ago, at Mr. Brum- mer's, another bowl of this hemispherical footless shape, though less important and of smaller size than the one just described; the only definite recollection I have of its interior design is that it contained fishes. A ewer-shaped lamp, formerly in the collection of M. H. R. d'Allemagne, has the same kind of gadrooning and the same double lines for the arches, indicating that this piece, though of different shape, belongs to the same group (Henry-Rend d'Allemagne, Du Khoras- san au pays des Backhtiaris, Paris, 19II, vol. 2, fig. in upper left corner on p. 5I). It should be pointed out that this piece was found in Khorasan. 20 The height of this cast bowl is io8 mm., its dia- meter 2 i6 mm. As to its interior, see below, p. 34I. There is another bowl of this series in the Teheran Museum, whose exterior is decorated in the same manner as the one just described, only that it has a larger number of friezes with circular motifs. Its interior, however, is different, having a guilloche framed by circular motifs as the main design in the center. 22* each other, bands with animals and, finally, the signs of the zodiac. There is also a definite con- nection between the Teheran piece and the Vaso Vescovali evidenced by the manner in which, in each case, the single row of round figures of the zodiac are framed and connected by thin bands forming loops between the individual units. The shape of the globular bowl without a foot continued not only into the thirteenth century, but well beyond the Mongol conquest, as shown by two bowls formerly in the Harari Collection and now in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo. The first, stifl pre-Mongol, has a more accentu- ated curvature than in earlier examples, with the base part lower and more pointed. Still it continues to have the characteristic inscription below the rim and the lower part is again gadrooned (fig. 6).21 The second is also of this general shape, but its most characteristic feature is its finial-topped cover which is fixed to the lower part by a hinge (fig. 7).22 This piece might still be called a version of the species and as such it is particularly related to the Vaso Vescovali, which has a similar cover. The character of the rich decoration and especially the lotus blossom date this covered bowl to the late thirteenth or, more likely, to the early fourteenth century. It was to this more or less hemispherical bowl that at one point in its evolution (possibly in the middle or third quarter of the twelfth centu- ry) a foot or stem was added. The connecting link between the footless and the footed types could very well be pieces on the order of a bowl which was formerly in the collection of the late Professor Herzfeld and whose present wherea- bouts is unknown; it is obvious from the draw- ing (text fig. I), which is based on a sketch made by the author many years ago, that this piece is a gadrooned bowl on the order of text figure H and figure I5, to which a foot was added which then became typical for the series.

A late (if not the last) stage in the develop- ment of the stem cup is, according to Dr. Rice, represented by the Peytel Cup, which he re- gards as being probably a mid-fourteenth- century work from Khorasan (p. i6) and as such the final terminus ante quem for the Wade (-naskhTi inscription (begirnnirnq writah ~CZ) on arabesqcue background F IG. I-STEM CuP. FORMERLY IN THE COLLECTION OF PROFESSOR ERNST HERZFELD, PRINCETON, N. J. (Drawn after a sketch of the writer.) Cup (fig. 5). He arrives at the date of this piece by assuming that "the title of sadr" borne by both the owner of the vessel and his father "probably indicates that they were religious leaders," and as they were without doubt Shi'ites he assumed "that they would fit into the milieu of Sarbadars of Sabzevar, who ruled over a large part of Khorasan from 738-88 H./I337-86" (P. I3). It can, however, be shown that the title of sadr was also borne by a purely mundane officeholder, namely a grand vizier, and that early in the thirteenth century. The main inscription on the Freer Gallery's pen case of Majd al-Mulk of 607 H./I2Io, who was the grand vizier of the Khwarizmshah 'Ala al-Din Muhammad, starts with al-sadr al-a] all; this dignitary was a sadr of Khorasan (sadr wa- nizaim Khorasan) and his father was likewise a sadr and a shahld23-all features which have a parallel on the Peytel Cup. This opens up further 23 E. Herzfeld, A bronze pen-case, Ars Islamica, vol. 3 (1936), p. 36. possibilities for the identification of a political figure in the thirteenth century, or at least prior to the middle of the fourteenth century. Such an earlier date would, in the writer's opinion, fit better the general character of the piece, since its shape is still fairly close to the Wade Cup and the Vaso Vescovali. As a matter of fact, what a post-Mongol cup, possibly of the four- teenth century, looked like is shown by a speci- men in the British Museum which indicates that the fine proportions between bowl and foot have been lost owing to the exaggerated increase of the latter and the changed profile of the former (fig. 8).24 In view of all this and before a more 24 Barrett, Op. cit., pl. 34, where it is called four- teenth century; Harari (Op. cit., p1. I357, D) calls the piece thirteenth to fourteenth century. This particular shape continued to be popular, as shown by such a stem cup in the Bibliotheque Nationale, which may be of the fourteenth or possibly fifteenth century (d'Allemagne, op. cit., vol. 2, fig. on p. go) and another late one formerly in the d'Allemagne collection (ibid., fig. on p. 65). R. Pinder-Wilson has called attention to a fourteenth-century parallel to the Vaso Vescovali, an enameled glass vessel belonging to the Kevorkian Foundation, which, on account of its annular knop in the stem, would be akin to Rice's second group (Pinder-Wilson, op. cit., p. 86; the piece is illustrated in R. Ettinghausen, The unicorn, Freer Gallery of Art Occasional Papers, vol. i, No. 3 [Washington, I950], pL. 20). Its proportions are also quite different from the earlier examples.</page><page sequence="15">THE WADE CUP 34I specific identification of the two suddir mention- ed on the Peytel Cup is possible, the early thirteenth-century attribution previously postu- lated by Max van Berchem,25 which was obvi- ously based on the character of the writing, should not be ruled out, or at least a date within the thirteenth century. IV. ANIMAL WHEELS, BIRDS, AND FISHES Dr. Rice uses, quite rightly, the three major decorative schemes, i.e., the four sphinxes, the signs of the zodiac, and the figural script, as clues to the date and the place of production of the Wade Cup. The first of these designs, the four sphinxes in the interior, is of special sig- nificance since it has close parallels in Mesopo- tamian metalwork from the court of Badr al- Din Lu'lu', a fact which weighed heavily in Dr. Rice's final determination of the region where the artist of the Wade Cup worked and, indirectly, of his period. However, the early history of the motif and its possible origin or meaning should also be investigated, as they provide important clues. After what we have said before, we should look for further leads among the decorations of the hemispherical footless bowls which this writer regards as the forerunners of the Wade Cup. It will be our aim to find further examples of revolving sphinxes or other winged animals, especially those which are surrounded by fishes, as this peculiar motif might give additional data for the understanding of the Wade Cup. Of the various stemless globular vessels to which we referred more specifically in the pre- ceding pages, the fourth is the one which pro- vides us in this instance with a clue (figs. i6 and 25 Notes d'archeologie arabe. III, Journal Asiatique, ser. Io, vol. 3 (I904), pp. 28-29 (quoted by Rice on p. 35, note iI). Van Berchem's dating is corroborated by the very similar shape of the pottery bowl of 6oo H./I203 (cf. figs. 3 and 5) and others from the early thirteenth century. I7). Here we find in the center a wheel motif consisting of a 6-armed swastika, the vertical bars of which are shaped like the heads and necks of birds, so that it seems as though the radiating spokes were, so to speak, the highly stylized wings or bodies of birds. It should also be noted that the artist inserted certain markings just above the point where these radiating spokes turn horizontally. Each of these little designs looks like the pointed head of a fish. Around this central motif single stylized birds are placed in nine roundels; all these birds are turned in the opposite direction to that in which the central wheel design is rotating. Finally, we have a border with a repetition of what seems to be a broken-down design. Here again the explanation which most readily comes to one's mind is that these are the highly con- ventionalized renditions of a series of fishes that move in the same direction as the birds in the roundels, that is, in the direction opposite to that of the central wheel motif. Obviously we have here an animal wheel and also various bird and fish designs moving in opposite directions, and if it can be shown that it is earlier than the Wade Cup it would be a forerunner of its design. The clue to its date is provided by the big-eyed, full-chested birds with broad, summarily treat- ed tail feathers and rather thin wings which, like the spandrel design of dotted circles, occur on a certain type of Persian sgraffiato pottery (text figs. J and K).26 These ceramic wares have always 26 Good examples are illustrated in M. Pezard, La ceramique archaique de l'Islam et ses origines, Paris, I920, vol. 2, pls. 19-23 and 29. For recent comments on this ware and their dates, see Arthur Lane, Early Islamic pottery, London, I947, p. 25, and E. Kiihnel, Die Kunst Persiens unter den Buyiden, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, vol. io6 (I956), p. 85. For a further clue to the dating of the brass bowl see footnote 75. After the completion of this article another charac- teristic bowl of this ware in the Bensillum collection in Cairo was published (Zak! Muhammad Hasan [Zaky M. Hassan], Atlas al-funun al-zukhruftyah wa'l- tasawir al-islamnyah [English subtitle: Atlas of Moslem decorative arts], Cairo, 1956, fig. 96). As its bird is very</page><page sequence="16">342 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN been thought to derive from engraved metalwork but they are too humble to have silver vessels as their prototypes, and bowls on the order of, or related to, the type here discussed are much more likely to have exerted this influence. Since the close connection between the designs on the FIG. J-BIRD MOTIF FOUND IN THE INTERIOR OF A BRASS BOWL. AUTHOR'S COLLECTION. FIG. K-BIRD MOTIF FOUND IN THE CENTER OF A POTTERY BOWL. (THE OUTER EDGE OF THE TAIL IS PARTLY RESTORED IN THE ORIGINAL.) ART INSTITUTE, CHICAGO. metal bowl and these pottery pieces can hardly be denied, one has to place the former slightly earlier than the generally accepted date for the latter, which is tenth to eleventh century. To understand the unusual design of the animal wheel on the metal bowl under discus- sion we will have to look at (slightly earlier) pottery, an ubiquitous and better preserved close to the Chicago example of text figure K, but better preserved, one can assume that originally the edge of the tailfeathers of the latter probably did not have indications of slight curves. working material than metalwork, or at glass vessels, to find an animal wheel, or birds and fishes, or a combination of the two, i.e., re- volving birds and fishes. This proof can be easily supplied and we are selecting a few char- acteristic examples to demonstrate this. A pottery fragment from Afrasiyab (Samarqand) in the Museum of Oriental Culture in Moscow has as its central design three highly stylized revolving birds forming a wheel pattern (fig. I9). Two other pieces were found in Nishapur: one is a glass bowl painted with several luster tones, belonging to Mr. Wilhelm Henrich; its deco- ration consists of a single large bird (not unlike the birds in the roundels of the metal bowl), which is surrounded by a circle of five fishes (fig. 26). The other, in the possession of Mr. E. Safani, is the most significant of these paral- lels; it is again a pottery bowl with two birds and two fishes, both revolving counterclockwise (fig. 27).27 There is an obvious iconographic relationship between these rotating birds and fishes and those on the cast bowl illustrated in figures i6 and I7; even a connection between 27 A very fine survival of the motif of revolving birds and fishes is to be found in a chinoiserie drawing, probably of the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Library of the Topkapu Sarayl Miuzesi in Istanbul (Hazine 2I52, fol. 70a). It will be observed that there are there two circles of birds, moving in opposite directions, and that in two circles the animals are also interlocked (fig. 37), features which are prefigured in the writer's metal bowl (figs. i6 and 17) and the Wade Cup. Drawings of this general type were attributed to Herat by Martin, Schulz, and the writer, and to western Turkestan by Kiihnel, which means in any case an east Iranian region. Even in Safavid art the choice of motifs is still governed by the old combination of birds and fishes, although the arrangement and lack of movement indicate that any understanding of the original setting has been lost. For this see, for instance, a tapestry in a private collection which has in its central medallion two pairs of confronted birds and next to them, at each side, a pair of linked fish, in oblong cartouches (Gertrude Robinson, An unknown sixteenth-century Persian carpet, Burlington Magazine, vol. 72 [I938], color pl. opp. p. I03).</page><page sequence="17">THE WADE CUP 343 this motif and the rotating sphinxes and fishes on the later Wade Cup is suggested, although this still needs further explanation, which will be presently given. To understand the next step in the develop- ment of this motif it should be pointed out that, besides revolving birds, the art of eastern Khorasan knew also other revolving animals, as shown by the early Nishapur pottery (fig. 20). Animal wheels appear also in metalwork of the second half of the twelfth century or possibly of its end. There is, for instance, a metal tray, FIG. L-CENTRAL DESIGN ON A METAL TRAY. FORMERLY COLLECTION OF M. H.-R. D'ALLEMAGNE, PARIS. formerly in the colection of M. d'Allemagne, in which four rabbits walk in a circle around a central point and this (as far as it can be made out from an earlier, poor illustration) in such a way that, owing to overlapping, only two pairs of ears had to be drawn (text fig. L).28 The same motif appears quite clearly on another Persian metal tray in the collection of Mr. Stuart C. Welch, Jr., of Cambridge, Mass. (fig. 21). Thus 28 D'Allemagne, op. cit., vol. 2, lower right fig. on p. 71. Unfortunately the author does not indicate where the piece was (said to have been) found in Persia. we have here not only the main general motif found on the Wade Cup, but also one of its unusual features, the fusing of animals. Nothing is known about where the Welch tray was found, but it includes, on the outer wall, at least one motif which is very characteristic of Khorasanian metalwork, the tri-partite vase with flower sprays. It occurs six times alternating with a roundel. The vase has an ovoid as its center section with the neck and foot drawn as triang- les, while each of the two hanging sprays carries a leaf and on the tip a budlike flower with two petals at the side (text fig. M). The inclusion of this design makes an East Iranian origin of the tray very likely. Finally and most signifi- cantly there exists also a piece with an animal wheel composed of four walking sphinxes whose wing tips interlock just as they do on the Wade Cup and the two Badr al-Din Lu'lu' brasses. It is to be found in the center of a rectangular brass tray whose corner spandrels are decorated with silver-inlaid arabesques and whose framing outlines and central dots in circular designs are inlaid with copper (figs. 31, 33 and 34). In view of the close connection with the Wade Cup and the two metal objects made by order of Badr al-Din Lu'lu', the date and region of origin of this piece, which is in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, is of great importance.29There is no specific information available as to a precise date, but pieces of this type are usually at- tributed to the second half of the twelfth century or shortly after I2oo. One can be more pre- cise about the locality. There is first the unusual shape, which has so far not been re- ported in the literature on bronze and brass vessels, but which is frequently found in Af- 29 Recently the writer has found another such rectangular tray with the same decoration (including the four sphinxes) and executed in the same technique. It was formerly in the van Gelder collection and is now owned by Miss Adrienne Minassian of New York. Both the Walters and the Minassian trays are unpublished.

And finally the sphinx itself in one form or another is well attested in Khorasanian metal- work, although designs with a single animal are probably not found there exclusively; a single winged sphinx is found on a bottle fragment in the Berlin Museum, made by 'Abd al-Razzaq al-NaysTbhrl (it is, as we shall see, significant in this connection that the sphinx occurs on this piece together with birds, on the bottom and top plates) ;31 two sphinxes in relief placed in op- posite directions, so as to indicate a circular movement around a central decoration, occur on one of the rectangular trays in the Kabul Museum (fig. 32). In view of the wheel of rabbits which we noticed on two trays (text fig. L and fig. 2I) in the position taken by sphinxes on other examples, it should be pointed out that on this Ghaznah tray the two sphinxes are sur- rounded by a frieze of walking rabbits, so that here the two animals are combined. It should also be pointed out that the center of this tray is filled with a large disc with four small leaves in the interstices of its four spokes, the whole surrounded by radiating roundish leaves. This has some bearing on the assumed original signi- ficance of this design which we shall presently take up. Finally we have the combination of three crouching (or possibly walking) sphinxes in openwork design and relief on the dome of an inlaid inkwell made by Nasir ibn As'ad NaysbhirL.32 All this seems to indicate that the 31 Sarre, Erzeugnisse islamischer Kunst, p. 9, No. 14, figs. 5 and 6; Harari, op. cit., pL.

In view of this conclusion one would have to assume that the Walters tray was made before the early I220's, when Khorasan was devastated by the Mongols. Since, owing to the use of the sovereign title "al-Malik al-Rahim," the Badr al-Din Lu'lu' basin and tray could only have been made in I233 at the earliest, it follows that this motif as used in Mosul was possibly bor- rowed from Khorasanian metalwork or, more likely, brought there by refugee artisans and is therefore hardly a clue for attributing a piece like the Wade Cup to a region bordering Mosul. In this connection it should also be pointed out that the sphinxes on the Munich basin of Lu'lu' (text fig. B) have the same interlocking wing tips and the ends of their tails turn back in the same manner as they do on the Walters object. On Lu'lu's tray in the Victoria and Albert Museum even the unusual feature of placing the sphinx wheel within an undecorated surface can now be explained by the same feature on the Walters tray and other brasses made in Khorasan. This makes it unnecessary to follow the assumption that the tray in the London museum may have been made by a non-Muslim. On the other hand, the occurrence of the rare sphinx wheel in Khorasan and then in Mosul and the "unusual" way of leaving a great deal of the background free of ornament in works from both regions supports Professor Kiihnel's theory that the metalworkers specializing in inlays were trans- planted from Herat to Mosul.33 clusions about their posture or movement can be drawn. The piece occurs in the Brummer Sale Cata- logue, part 2 (May II-I4, I949) as No. II7, but it is not illustrated. The present whereabouts of this piece is not known to the writer. 33 Kiihnel, Zwei Mosulbronzen und ihr Meister, pp. 8-9, I 5; about the same time R. Harari had come to similar conclusions (Op. Cit., p. 2496); their idea was To interpret the motif in the Wade Cup's in- terior it will not do to assume that the design of revolving birds and that of quadrupeds (cf. fig. 20) were combined to form a wheel composed of an- other winged animal; and that the result of this amalgamation, the sphinx, would, so to say, form a link between bird and beast, but still keep the traditional complement of the former, i.e., the fishes. An explanation of this sort would be too formal and superficial. The real clue lies in the reason for the persistent interest in animal wheels and in birds and fishes, both of which already occurred, as Miss Anna Roes has shown, in prehistoric times and continued to be used throughout the millennia. It is obvious that they must have had some significance. As a revolving circular motif, they were originally in all likelihood a solar symbol in which "the fish may stand for the nightly phase of the sun, for the sun sunk into the sea, whereas the bird symbolizes the sun in the sky."34 accepted by Mehmet Aga-Oglu (About a type of Islamtic incense burner, The Art Bulletin, vol. 27 [I945], p. 40). The possibility of a non-Muslim artist for the Victoria and Albert Museum tray was con- sidered by D. S. Rice in The brasses of Badr al-din Lu'lu', Bull. of the School of Oriental and African Studies, vol. I3 (I950), p. 633. 34 Anna Roes, Tierwirbel, Ipek, vol. II (I936-37), pp. 85-I05; idemt, Birds and fishes, Ex Oriente Lux, vol. Io (I945-48), pp. 465, 47I, and 472. Possibly bird and fishes just stand for the sun and water. The rabbit and rabbit wheel (cf. text fig. L and fig. 21) on the other hand, have been interpreted as lunar symbols (Roes, Tierwirbel, p. 94; W. Deonna, Atres monstrueux d organes communs, Revue Archeo- logique, 5e s6rie, vol. 3I [I930], pp. 32-33). These occur in areas as widely separated in distance and time as Pharaonic Egypt, Buddhist Central Asia, and mediaeval Europe. Miss Roes (Tierwirbel, p. 99) has referred in particular to a painting in Qyzil, where a rabbit on a moon disk is matched with a decidedly solar symbol (A. von Le Coq und E. Waldschmidt, Die buddhistische Spatantike in Mittelasien, Berlin, I928, vol. 6, fig. on p. 77). A similar parallel use is found on the rectangular tray in the Kabul Museum (fig. 32), just as a combination of lunar and solar symbols occurs on classical ceilings (Karl Lehmann,</page><page sequence="20">346 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN Let us accept this well-reasoned hypothesis for the moment, or at least the solar nature of the animal wheel (and particularly the bird wheel), since it is more difficult to bring support for the given interpretation of the surrounding fishes. Then, with this explanation in mind, one would, in accordance with generally held beliefs, be inclined to think that the Islamic versions are, as rather late examples in the long develop- ment of the symbol, purely decorative, or at best, designs whose original meaning was at the time only dimly felt. An investigation of this question has made it clear, however, that the bird wheel was still regarded as a solar symbol by the Muslims of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This can be shown in at least two ways: we find that a wheel of birds can take the place of the usual sun disk with rays in the common scheme of the seven planets;35 or a revolving wheel of birds in one case (fig. 39) is paralleled by the usual rendering of the sun in another (fig. 40), with the central motif in both cases surrounded by fishes.36 There are other such cases but these examples-the first from The dome of heaven, The Art Bulletin, vol. 27 [I945], figs. 8 and 63). The horned animals which form the center of an animal wheel on the Nishapur bowl in the Mus6e du Louvre (fig. 20) occur also in the same function (either in twos or fours) in prehistoric pottery (E. Herzfeld, Die vorgeschichtlichen Tdpfereien von Samarra, Berlin, I930, text figs. i8, 20, 2I, 23, 25-27; Roes, Tierwirbel, pp. 85-86). Two heads of such animals are applied to the spikes of a 4-armed swastika on a Sasanian seal (Paul Horn and Georg Steindorff, Sasanidische Siegel- steine, Berlin, I89I, pl. 4, No. I583). 85 On the bottom of the basin made for the Ayyuibid Sultan al-'Adil II, Abu Bakr between I238 and I240 in the Musee du Louvre (cf. D. S. Rice, Inlaid brasses from the workshop of A hmad al-Dhakf al-Mawsilf, Ars Orientalis, vol. 2 [I957], pp. 30T-302). 36 Figure 39 is the inside of a Persian inlaid brass bowl of the third quarter of the fourteenth century, in the Walters Art Gallery (No. 54. 455); for a general view of this piece see Handbook of the collection. Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, I936, fig. on p. 48, center. Figure 40 is the inside of a still unpublished Persian bowl in the Freer Gallery (No. 49. ii) from the early fourteenth century. In this piece the fishes thirteenth-century Syria and the second from fourteenth-century Iran-will suffice to demon- strate the point that at the time when the Wade Cup was made a bird wheel was not just "deco- ration" but was in diverse quarters considered a symbol of the sun. What is likewise astonishing in this connection is how faithfully the Muslim artisans kept certain details of the ancient design. If we look at the earliest example of the motif so far traced, which is to be found on a piece of pre- historic pottery from Samarra, it will be noticed that a circle of four birds holding fishes in their beaks moves around a central swastika, the whole surrounded by a circle of fishes (text fig. N).37 This is precisely the same concept found in the brass bowl illustrated in figures i6 and I7, only that a 6-armed swastika and the birds with fishes are now all joined in a single motif. The fact that the central design has become more abstract and hardly recognizable may have been the reason that the craftsman was induced to reinforce it again by inserting a second row of birds in roundels, since they are a major aspect of the motif and their existence in a second cirde was, moreover, suggested by the "Samarra design."" Finally, we find in both move in each circular row in a different direction and there is another frame of radially grouped fishes. The same arrangement is found on another such bowl in the Metropolitan Museum (No. 9I. 1. 58I). 37 The motif was discovered and first dealt with by E. Herzfeld in his study of prehistoric pottery of Samarra (op. cit., pp. I4 and I5; figs. 7 and 8, pls. 6 and 39; also idem, Iran in the ancient Near East, London-New York, I94I, p. 58 and fig. I07). Its importance as one of the oldest known and most long-lived symbols was pointed out by Miss Roes in Tierwirbel, pp. 85-86 and 94, and Birds and fishes, pp. 46I, 468, and 472. As to the date of this earliest occurrence of the motif, Miss Roes states: "Some authorities date it as early as the sixth millennium B.C., and no one seems to put it later then the fifth" (10c cit., p. 46I). 38 Such a case of reinforcement may also be present in the tray of the Kabul Museum (fig. 32), where the circular motif in the center and the two sphinxes may express the same idea.</page><page sequence="21">THE WADE CUP 347 cases the encircling line of fishes. The only basic difference between the two sets of represen- tations, separated though they are by more than five thousand years, is the fact that in the Muslim example the circles of animals revolve in two different directions while they all move FIG. N-DESIGN IN PREHISTORIC BOWL FOUND IN SAMARRA. (After Herzfeld, Iran in the ancient East.) counterclockwise in the Samarra example. The idea of a bird holding a fish in its beak is still preserved in vestigial form in the center of the Walters bowl, where the head of each fish is close to the beak of a duck (fig. 39). If it is thought that this identification of the bird-with- fish motif on the two brass bowls is farfetched and not actually warranted, one might point to an earlier and more obvious Islamic version on an object from the fourth/tenth century, made in Iraq, which is precisely the same region from which the prehistoric Samarra bowl came. It occurs on a pottery plate (belonging to Mr. K. Rabenou in New York) whose luster deco- ration includes two long-tailed birds, each with a fish in its beak and both revolving counter- clockwise (text fig. 0). Here the meaning of the design is changed, as it is combined with a seated man holding a goblet in his right hand and a flower in his left. In this study we are not concerned with what this particular decoration might represent, yet even so it is clear that here one of the design elements-the revolving birds *,,O FIG-r. O-DESIGN ON A LUSTER BOWL. TENTH CENTURY. NEW YORK, POSSESSION OF MR. KHALIL RABENOU. with captured fishes-still follows an age-old pattern. In view of the persi'stence of meaning and details 'in th'is symbol, the s'ignificance of the wheel of sphinxes should be noted, since it represents a departure from the norm. Evren before we go into a discussion of what the sphinxes stand for, 'it is obri'ous that the wheel of birds and that of sphinxes served the same decorat'ive function. This is shown not only by the earlier East Iranian examples on metal (fig. I7) and on pottery (fig. 27), where the bilrds occupy the same position as later on the sphinx- es, but also by the use of both desilgns in the work done for Badr al-Din Lu'lu'. This ruler had not only the wheel of sphinxes appliled to the center of trays and basins (text fig. B), but</page><page sequence="22">348 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN on one of his boxes now in the British Museum we find, in the same central position, a wheel composed of ducks whose necks form the same kind of knot as do the wings of the sphinxes (text fig.

It is more difficult to reconstruct the con- notations of the sphinxes so that we can grasp their meaning. Since they have obviously something to do with a traditional solar symbol whose basic meaning was still understood, their presence cannot be due to the whim of an artist or to a temporary fashion, but must have had some long-established connection with the sun. This would, of course, not preclude that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this particular animal could also have been interpreted in a new, though related, manner. If we survey the objects of Iranian art of earlier times we have to go back to the Achaemenian period, when there was indeed a close relationship between sphinxes and the sun. This is shown, for instance, by a seal on which two such standing animals support a winged sun disk with a crescent disk enclosing a crowned god between them (fig. 25).40 Rice, The brasses of Badr al-den Lu'lu', p. 629, text fig. i and pl.

No. 8I7, description in text vol. p. I03. The very similarly composed seal, No. 8i8, has, instead of the standing sphinxes addorsed, regardant birds whose heads nearly There is, of course, a tremendous time gap be- tween this seal and the Wade Cup. However, we have already found that the birds and fishes on another metal vessel go back to a design several thousand years old with no immediate close Irani- an example known to us; hence we could very well assume that in this case, too, there existed a so far not yet discovered tradition leading to the re-emergence of an ancient form and concept. While we are not concerned here with the combi- nation of sun and sphinx prior to Achaemenian times, nor with its precise meaning at that early touch the winged sun disk above them. This seal in turn is very close to a seal formerly in the E. T. Newell collection in which the birds are replaced by two confronted seated sphinxes, of which at least the cap of the right one touches the sun disk (H. H. von der Osten, Ancient oriental seals in the collection of Mr. Edward T. Newell, Chicago, I934, pl. 3, No. 457). This points not only to an association of the sphinx with the sun, but also to the fact that their place can be taken by birds, or vice versa, a fact which explains their continued association in Muslim art (see above, n. 3I). That the two sphinxes and the sun symbol belong together and are not necessarily linked to the divine figure in a crescent circle between them, is shown by a seal in the Brett collection which has only the two confronted sphinxes and the sun symbol above them (H. H. von der Osten, Ancient seals in the collection of Mrs. Agnes Baldwin Brett, Chicago, I936, p. I9, No. I33, pL. ii), or by two seals in the Biblio- th6que Nationale where there is either a tree of life or a stand between them, again with the sun symbol on top (Louis Delaporte, Catalogue des cylindres orientaux et des cachets ... de la Bibliothkque Nationale, Paris, I910, vol. I, pp. 327-328, Nos. 632 and 633; album, pl 38). The sphinxes on the two Bibliotheque Nationale seals had been described as "Lions ail6s .a tete humaine barbue..," but on inquiry Miss Porada was kind enough to inform the writer that the sphinxes on the Morgan seals are probably "bull-bodied like the bull-men of seal No. 793 [of her publication] and the earlier bull-men of the Old Babylonian period which are so frequently the adjuncts of the sun-god (H. Frankfort, Cylinder seals, London, I939, p. I7I f.). Lion-bodied sphinxes are more likely to occur in Syrian cylinders, but not as supports, just'with the winged sun-disk floating above them. The supporters of the winged sun-disk from Yazilikaya look super- ficially as if they were lion-men, but also have bulls' bodies on closer study."</page><page sequence="23">THE WADE CUP 349 period, so much is certain, that the sphinx had certain solar aspects that could have made it ac- ceptable later. Moreover, whichever way it was originally interpreted, the leonine body of the sphinx on the Wade Cup led one to associate it with the zodiacal sign which shows the sun's house in Leo (see fig. i on the left side of the globu- lar body). Since this combination of sun and lion goes back to the fourth millenium B.C., the lion has, here as always, a strong solar significance.4' The wings endow the animal, of course, with the quality of a bird, and it is thus linked physio- logically and iconographically with the original form of the animal wheel. In addition to these old solar aspects of the sphinx there is a new Islamic concept which admits of a supplemen- tary explanation. When Ibn al-BalkhT visited the province of Fars at the beginning of the twelfth century he carefully described the large monsters built into the still standing gateway of Xerxes at Persepolis; he called them represen- tations of Burdq.42 Since Muhammad's mount for his ascension has traditionally the body of an ass, mule, or, possibly, a horse,43 but not of 41 Hartner, The pseudoplanetary nodes of the moon's orbit in Hindu and Islamic iconographies, pp. I I5 and I I9. 42 Ibn al-Balkhi, The Farsnama of Ibnu 'I-Balkhi, ed.

I26, lines 19-21; idem, Description of the province of Fars, in Persia, at the beginning of the twelfth century A.D., Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, I9I2, p. 27. That the ruins of Persepolis were also frequented by other men is shown by the two sgrafitti of the Buiyid 'A.dud al-Dowleh (1. Combe ,J. Sauvaget, and G. Wiet, Repertoire chronologique d'epigraphie arabe, Le Caire, I933, vol. 4, Nos. I475 and I476) and the visits of persons who collected there stone fragments, since according to Ibn al-Balkhi and Hajjl Khallifah filed particles from these stones were used as a stiptic for wounds (Farsnarma, p. 126, and E. Blochet, I8tudes sur l'histoire religieuse de l'Iran, Revue de l'Histoire des Religions, vol. 40 [I899], p. 2I6, quoting the Jahan-nameh, in which Hajjl Khallifah also speaks of the Buraq sculpture at the site). 43 See Josef Horovitz, Muhammeds Himmelfahrt, Der Islam, vol. 9 (I9I8-I9), p. I79; Sir Thomas Arnold, Painting in Islam, Oxford, I928, p. ii8. a bull, as these large animals of Persepolis have, it was rather their human heads and wings that caused Ibn al-BalkhI to call them Buraq. In view of this, he would certainly have applied the term to sphinxes of the type we find in the Wade Cup because they, too, show a human head and wings with the body of a quadruped. This new interpretation as Buraq brings to the wheel pattern the concepts of swift flight, ascent, sky and heaven,44 all of which make it akin to the original associations of the bird design, whose place the sphinxes have taken.45 Yet in spite of the substitutions there are also many cases where the sphinx and the bird occur in close proximity in decorative schemes, as they were obviously linked together in the minds of the craftsmen.46 While it is now understandable that a mediae- val artist like the Master of the Wade Cup should substitute the sphinx for the bird in a solar symbol, one would still have to explain why such a replacement took place just then, as it is apparently not yet found in the earlier art of Nishapur.47 The reason for this is probably 44There is even a late twelfth-century association of Buraq and sun; see the description of him by Nizam1, in the "Introduction to the Iskandar-nameh": "Burak-the hastener, lightning-like, beneath him His housings, like the sun bathed in light": (The Sikandar Nama, e Bara, or Book of Alexander the Great, written in A .D. 1200, by ....... Nizdmu-'d- Din, tr. H. Wilberforce Clarke, London, i88i, p. 3I, verse IO.) The pertinent Persian expression is: setlmash chui khfirshid dar nur gharq (cf. Freer Gallery of Art, No. o8. 278, p. 528, line 2, col. 4). 45 In certain individual mystical experiences in which the mystic takes Muhammad's Mi'rej as a theme, his ascending spirit turns symbolically into a bird, thus once more showing the affinity of bird and Buraq (al-Hujwlrl, The Kashf al-mahijib..., tr. R. A. Nicholson, Leyden-London, I91I, p. 238, quoting Abfi Yazid [Bayazid] of Bistam [died 26i H./875]). 46 See above, footnotes 3I, 40, and 45. 47 For the problem of the exact time when the sphinx makes its appearance in mediaeval Iranian art it would be of great importance to have the question of the authenticity of the Buiyid textiles of Bib! Shahr-e</page><page sequence="24">350 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN twofold. Although there has always been a strong interest in Muhammad's ascension, the period just prior to the making of the Wade Cup was more preoccupied with this theme, owing to the great fervor of contemporary mystical writing and the mystical implications of the theme.0 This applied not only to the pure mystic but also to poets. Nizami, for Banfi (two of which are dated 388 H./9g8 and 393 H. /I003) settled by the textile experts, as the represen- tations on the fabrics seem to be the earliest examples (G. Wiet, Soieries persanes, Le Caire, I948, PP. 5I-54, pl. 8). If they should prove to be genuine, another in- teresting question arises. As has been shown by J. Horovitz, Tha'alibi (died in Nishapur in 429 H./IO38) was the first to produce a tradition according to which the Buraq had "a human cheek" (op. cit., p. i8o; Arnold, op. cit., p. ii8). Did Tha'alibi see representa- tions of sphinxes which he interpreted as the Buraq and then introduced in his writings, or were the con- temporary designers so stimulated by his text that they were led to identify his description with the sculptures of Persepolis, which they then reproduced? Whatever may be the answers to these questions, once the Buraq was acknowledged to have a human face, the sphinx had, of course, a special appeal to the believers. 48 "The Night Journey of Muhammad constitutes for the Sufis the Prophet's supreme mystical experience and an example which they may aspire to follow. It is therefore not without significance that Abu '1-Qasim al-Qushairli (d. 465/I074), author of the most famous and authoritative treatise on Sufism in Arabic, wrote a separate work on this theme in which he collected together several versions of the ascent (mi'raj), together with comments of the celebrated Sufis on the enigmatic references to the event which are con- tained in the Koran" (A. J. Arberry, Sufism. An account of the mystics of Islam, London, I950, Pp. 28-29). There is also the Futithat al-Makkfyah of Ibn 'Arabi, and on another religious level the Mi'raj-na-meh, which in I264 was translated into Spanish and then into French and Latin. All these various texts have been much studied in connection with the possibility of an Islamic inspiration of Dante (Miguel Asfn Palacios Islam and the Divine Comedy, tr. Harold Sunderland, London, 1926, PP. 45-51; idemt, La escatologia musul- mana en la Divina Comedia, Madrid-Granada, I943; E. Cerulli, II "Libro della Scala" e la questione delle fonti arabo-spagnole della Divina Commedia, Citta del Vaticano, I949). instance, prefaces his writing, as Sir Thomas Arnold has already pointed out, with lyrical outbursts on the theme of Muhammad's mi'raj.49 The other condition which contributed to the change in the motif was a new interest in the monuments of the Iranian past. This is notice- able not only in the close observation of ancient monuments and their accurate description by a man like Ibn al-BalkhI, but in many objects of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries which imitate particular forms and motifs of the Sasanian period.50 There are also, to a lesser degree, borrowings from art forms current during the Achaemenian dynasty and apparent- ly not used to any large extent in the following periods.51 The sphinx, which occurs rather frequently during the Seljuq period, is the outstanding example of such a dependence on art forms of the ancient Orient, as already recognized by E. Blochet, J. Horovitz, and Sir Thomas Arnold.52 It is a conjunction of these two tendencies which apparently made the substitution of the sphinx in the bird wheel possible. Our next task is to give an explanation for the number of sphinxes on the Wade Cup. In many Asiatic cosmic representations the number four suggests the four points of the compass;;3 49Arnold, op. cit., p.

Nizami was a contemporary of the Master of the Wade Cup. 50 The pioneer studies for this question were made by Sir Thomas Arnold (Survivals of Sasanian and Manichaean art, Oxford, I924) and F. Sarre (see, e.g., his Die Tradition in der iranischen Kunst, IjIe Congr6s international d'art et d'arch6ologie iraniens, M6moires, Moscou-Leningrad, I939, pp. 227-228, pL. I04).

In view of these facts, the four animals in this solar symbol are more likely to represent the cycle of the Four Seasons, the animals being joined, as together they form the year. Repre- sentations of the seasons in a cosmic setting are, of course, very natural and they occur, for instance, in late classical, Jewish, and Christian ceilings and mosaics, and in Mithraic statuary.55 This form or symbolism is, however, ever so much older than Roman and Islamic renderings, as it occurs already in the prehistoric pottery of Samarra, where the wheel is also composed of four birds or four other animals whose presence was then certainly meaningful and can be best explained as representing the seasons.56 In any case, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D. it is usually four animals that constitute the sun wheel, vide the four sphinxes on the Wade Cup, the Walters tray, the basin in Munich, and the four lions on the stone from Daghestan, while the wheel composed of three sphinxes, as we find it on the tray of Badr al-Din Lu'lu' in the Victoria and Albert Museum, goes together with that form of solar symbolism which shows a 3-faced or tripartite sun.57 If 54Herzfeld, Die vorgeschichtlichen T6pfereien von Samnarra, text figs. 9, I'-I3, i6, I8-27. 55 Lehmann, op. cit., figs. 5, I0, I2, I3, I5, i8, 42, 45, and 63.; E.

Possibly there are only aes- thetic considerations, as in some cases, especially the early ones, they all have a parallel course (text fig. N, figs. 20 and 27), while later they run, as in the Wade Cup, in opposite directions (figs. 2, I7, 37 and 40). As to the relationship between the central animal wheel and the accompanying fishes, a general trend in the development can be observed. In the early decorative arts of the Muslim period up to the Wade Cup the two have about equal importance (figs. 26 and 27), although in the writer's brass bowl (fig. I7) the sun symbol looms large in proportion to the surrounding circle of fishes, which, in the case of the Walters tray, can even be dispensed with (fig. 31). After that the central part of the symbol has a tendency to become less important, so that it appears eventually as a small unit surrounded by a large body of fishes (fig. 39). The section with the fishes starts also to include many other creatures living in or on the water, such as ducks, crabs, turtles, and so on, even to water sprites (fig. 39). This trend is already noticeable in the Wade Cup, as it contains some other water animals besides the fishes (and even some land animals which do not fit into the concept).

The fishes are then usually combined in radial or circular arrangements, the "Baptistere de Saint Louis" in the Mus'e du Louvre59 and the Walters bowl being typical fourteenth-century examples. As these vessels were often destined to hold water, the realistic aspect of such a decoration comes to the fore, as it suggests a body of water teeming with aquatic life.60 On the other hand, simpler pieces show the design reduced to a minimum (text figs.

This leaves only the question of the possible meaning of the so far unexplained design feature of the Wade Cup's interior, namely, the I2 radiating stalks. Inasmuch as the basic motif is, as we have seen, of solar nature, the most plausible explanation is that they are an adjunct of the main concept and represent the 59 Idem, Le Baptistere de Saint Louis, Paris, I95I, figs. 22 and 23 and pl. 40. 60 The combination of fishes and aquatic animals with what seems to be a solar symbol is already found in the pre-Islamic art of the Near East (see the silver fragment in the Walters Art Gallery of the fourth- fifth century, possibly from Egypt, discussed by Marvin Chauncey Ross, Notes on Byzantine gold and silversmith's work, Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, vol. i8 [1955], p. 6o, fig. 3)- rays of the sun in the same way as we find them, for instance, in a somewhat different form in the central roundel of figure 40. Decorative roundels with radiating strokes at the edge are called shamseh, from shams-sun, in Iran and the same term is applied in Iraq to starlike configurations with appended medallions, as found in architectural decoration,6' so that the solar nature of the design is apparent to the people even when the motif is not realistically rendered.

It seems pretty certain that the whole decorative scheme of the Wade Cup's interior developed from the disk which is placed at the bottom of the bowl where the foot joins it. Its 61 See E.

One may only ask whether this disk was in this form applied deliberately or not. We pose this question because when one compares the Wade Cup with the (undecorated) interior of the Metropolitan Museum stem cup No. 9I. I. 542, which belongs to the same group, and even with the much earlier Chinese vessels of a closely related shape, one becomes aware that they show a perfectly rounded bowl without break, although they, too, were cast as one unit (cf. text figs. F and G and fig. 2). By com- parison the handling of the problem in the Wade Cup looks technically inept, as the beautiful curve of the bowl's interior is awkwardly broken by the recessed area in its center. While this criticism is justified when applied to a bowl it would not be so in the case of another hemi- spherical form, namely, a dome above a building (or tent). All over Asia, as also in the classical world and then again in Christianity, a cosmic symbolism is associated with this roof form which depicts the canopy of the sky with a real opening in the center, or in which a round painting in the apex reproduces a vista into the beyond, or which has a lantern with a visionary scene above the round hole. This is the "Sun Door," or "Gate of Heaven." If it is not a hole, it provides, as just stated, a vista or symbol of the Supreme Being in heaven, which can be a celestial dragon; Jupiter, or Helios; or Christ as the Pantocrator, and so on (text fig. S).63 Should such an architectural setting have given the inspiration for the Wade Cup, we would, by f3 Lehmann, op. cit., pp. 2-27; Cammann, Cloud collar, pp. 2-4. Text figure S is made after Lehmann, oc. cit., fig. 27, and represents the central part of the decorative scheme on the stuccoed dome of Nero's Golden House, showing the central painting with Jupiter on the clouds and along the periphery the edge of the 8-cornered canopy of the sky.

This idea is perhaps not as farfetched as it sounds when one remembers that celestial bodies have been represented on domes and throne canopies in Achaemenid, Parthian, Sasanian, and even in Muslim times down to fairly recent centuries." Furthermore, certain FIG. S-CENTER OF DOME DECORATION WITH JUPITER ON CLOUDS AND "CANOPY OF THE SKY." DOMUS AUREA OF NERO, ROME.

Still, as we have stated above, we only wish to pose the problem here, this not being the place to follow up intricate clues so as to be able to decide this question. Only a systematic exploration of the place of symbolism in Islamic art, and especially that connected with cosmic forces and their possible relationship to dome decoration, can clarify this issue.69 This survey shows that the figures of the zodiac on the outside of the Wade Cup are not an iso- lated astrological element. The artist was also concerned with the sun, although its symbol is not of classical but of prehistoric origin. This cosmic 66 Lehmann, Op. Cit., p. 5, quoting L. Curtius. "I A. U. Pope, The art of carpet making, A survey of Persian art, London-New York, I938-39, vol. 6, pl. II34, and in many other places. fi8 See, for instance, A. U. Pope, The ceramic art in Islamic times. A. The history, A survey of Persian art, London-New York, I938-39, vol. 5, pl. 7I2. When one studies our text figure S one notices that one more feature has a parallel on the Wade Cup, namely, the concave edges between the stalks proper. As Professor Lehmann has shown, this detail occurs in many cosmic representations of domes or on mosaics of the late classical art indicating the "canopy of the sky," or, as he calls it, "the dome of heaven." Such an interpretation seems, however, little likely in the case of the Wade Cup, as the sphinx wheel is basically an old oriental pattern, while the concept of the canopy comes from the Roman world. The concave edges between projecting points are therefore most probably only a decorative feature by which the individual stalks are joined. 69 I intend to deal with these questions in a later study. aspect of the Wade Cup brings it closer to the Vaso Vescovali, whose strong astrological con- text seemed to have set it so far apart from the other stem cups. There is a second conclusion to be drawn. Islamic art, when it is not strictly illustrative, is generally assumed to be merely decorative, so that it is commonly thought to be enough to list the constituent elements and to describe their organization. Pieces like the Wade Cup and the above-quoted examples, which show that the solar nature of the bird and fish motif was stijl understood and appropriately used, give us pause and make us suspect that other pieces, too, probably contain more than appears on the surface. This does not mean, of course, that all decorative schemes in Muslim art had a meaning. Far from it. Even those decorations which have apparently a significant content were probably not everywhere understood as such; possibly even the artists who made these objects may not have been fully aware of symbolical implications. In many cases they may have regarded these ornaments as tradi- tional patterns which were the proper and efficacious ones for certain pieces or functions; or again certain decorative elements were brought into play by others in the scheme by way of some mental association (such as in the combination of sphinxes and birds). There are many levels of awareness and knowledge, as a society in which Siffism was widespread under- stood only too well. Actually, even when the symbolical picture was true and clear, thus making a proper understanding possible, the grasp of its meaning could soon be lost. This is demonstrated by the deterioration of the symbols which turn into mere decorations with only vague hints of the original content. It is therefore to the development of the designs on other stem cups that we are now turning. On the Vaso Vescovali a 6-pointed central star replaces the animal wheel, which means that the motif has lost its circular motion, just as its surrounding circle of fishes has been</page><page sequence="42">THE WADE CUP 355 deprived of its movement by having two fishes confront each other three times (text fig. T). This deviation is in tune with its more advanced decoration; it is, for instance, the only object of the series which does not have the usual in- scription band around the outside edge. On the other hand the fishes are entirely lacking a- FIG. T-VESCOVALI CUP. FIG. U-FLORENCE CUP. FIG. V-FANO Cup. FIGS. T-V-DESIGNS IN THE CENTERS OF THREE STEM CUPS (After drawings by D. S. Rice.) round the sphinx wheels on the two Mesopo- tamian brasses of Badr al-Din Lu'lu', as they are on the Walters tray. One can imagine that they were left out because, owing to the sub- stitution of sphinxes for birds, they were only improperly understood by some Khorasanian artists, and even less so in Mosul. A still more advanced transformation of the motif is found on the cup from northwest Persia in the Museo Nazionale im Florence which dates from the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century (text fig. U). It has only a central star with neither an animal wheel nor a circle of fishes; this corres- ponds to the iconographically simplified orna- mentation on its outer surface, although it is still good work-decoratively speaking. On the Fano Cup in the Bibliotheque Nationale, which comes from Ayyiibid Syria and is thus farthest away from the country of origin of these cups, this particular motif, the star, has taken on minute proportions and is of little significance in the purely decorative medallion scheme (text 23* fig. V). This tallies again with the main orna- mentation of the piece, which, as Rice rightly says, "is in a class apart" and is covered with a different iconographic theme on the outside. While in the preceding discussion the empha- sis was on the transformations of the combined animal wheel and the bird and fish motif, as we find it on the Wade Cup, and its final dissolution, another aspect of the decorative scheme should not, however, be overlooked. If we consider once more the design of the interior of the Wade Cup, we see that it contains, besides the central wheel motif, a series of i2 radiating elements which form an outer star design around a circle. In the Vaso Vescovali a star design has been substituted for the wheel motif, with the outer radii reduced in size but increased in number (the design is partly obscured through decomposition; in Rice's reconstruction [see text figure T] the number of these tassel-like rays is 49). In the Florence cup the last vestiges of the bird and fish design have been eliminated and instead the central star design has become richer and more complex; but we still have the radiating strokes and again in large numbers, i.e., there are 50 such radiating elements (text fig. U). Finally, on the last piece of the group, the Fano Cup, there is only a small star in the center and the rays are replaced by a series of</page><page sequence="43">RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN I4 scallops (text fig. V). Is this insistence on a central wheel or star design, and especially on the strokes radiating from a circle, a basic iconographic concept to which the artists ad- hered even when they had given up the bird and fish design ? Or is this design rather a "natural" decorative feature for the center of a bowl, possibly due to psychological necessities, and thus very satisfactory to fill a void? A definite answer to these questions can be given only after a much wider survey of this and other material has been made. But it should at least be pointed out that quite similar questions can be raised when we look at the decorations on the outside of the cups. For this our starting point is one of the Teheran bowls, which shows the figures of the zodiac in a single row, each given as a round design (fig. 22). The same single-row arrangements of roundels is found on the Vaso Vescovali (fig. 9). The Metropolitan Museum cup has the figure of the zodiac in two rows with the roundels placed in staggered positions. Staggered rows are also used for the Wade Cup, although here the individual units are no longer round but, owing to the swathing bands which organize the surface, either diamond- or triangular-shaped. However, the curved outlines of at least the lower triangular group make their form not too different in ap- pearance from a roundel. When we now proceed to look over the various other pieces which do not have figures of the zodiac we find that the Brummer Cup shows a sequence of roundels, while on the Fano Cup a series of polylobed medallions alternates with small roundels in the main register. Even the pottery cup, dated 672 H./I274, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, has roundels alternating with a motif of a different sort. While these three pieces show the roundel design in a single row, the second, still unpublished, bowl in the Metropolitan Museum to which we have drawn attention shows a series of undecorated roundels in two staggered rows. Finally, we have a third group consisting of the Baltimore, Naples, and Florence cups; here the roundels are given in three staggered rows with a parallel proliferation of the in- dividual units, which can be of different sizes and at times of slightly varying shape. This suggests clearly that there are certain basic forms to which the artists adhered over a con- siderable period and even in different countries; on the other hand, content and number could be varied. It seems particularly significant that these shapes are more permanent than the designs within them. However, such a deduction does not imply that these particular shapes and ways of organizing the surface are found ex- clusively on the cups, but rather that, of various decorative schemes, only particular ones were more or less invariably used in specific places, once they had been adopted for whatever reasons. V. FIGURAL SCRIPTS The chapter dealing with the various scripts with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic aspects is possibly the most interesting and significant in Dr. Rice's book, not only because it brings together to a much larger extent than ever before a great deal of material which is admi- rably presented in drawings, but because it also finally leads to the author's dating and in- directly provides another argument for his localization of the Wade Cup. As these various scripts are therefore shown to be important for the historical placing of the object, it seems essential to present additional information which could throw further light on it. Notwithstanding the fact that the author is justified in stating that the "animated" and "human-headed" scripts do not begin (as far as we are aware at present) before the middle of the twelfth century, that is, with the Bobrinsky bucket of II63, and are restricted to metalwork, it can now nevertheless be said that the phe- nomenon of the "figural" script as such (and its zoomorphic aspect in particular) starts at least I50 years earlier, with the first documents so far known being on pieces of pottery of the</page><page sequence="44">THE WADE CUP 357 late tenth or early eleventh century. Here we find what one might call "ornithomorphic" inscriptions, since figures of birds form integral parts of the Kiufic letters. So far there have become known comparatively few vessels which show this type of script as clearly as it appears on the example here illustrated as figure 23, but there are a good many other specimens, even from the tenth century, on which the lettering seems to be endowed with bird heads (text fig. W and fig. 24), an assumption which is now sup- FIG. W-INSCRIPTION ON POTTERY PLATE FROM NISHAPUR. ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM, TEHERAN. ported by the pieces in which the birds are quite obvious. The further history of this particular script has not yet been explored; it continued, however, at least until I2IO, as the signature of the Freer pen case is also ornithomorphic Kuific, with birds' heads on the upended final strokes of the letters yd and sin. It is hoped that the final report on the Metropolitan Museum's exca- vations in Nishapur will provide new informa- tion about this script. There is still one other related type of writing, which should be considered in this context. It exists both in Kuific and naskhi and is found on a silver and copper inlaid brass platter belonging to the Heeramaneck Galleries in New York. Here the letters are fused with the heads of real and fanciful animals, including birds, with the zoomorphic parts fixed to the lower and upper parts of the letters (figs. 28-30). In a few in- stances we find even human heads (in the case of the naskhi inscription in the interior, they are fixed at right angles to the tops of the hastae). However, these human heads play here only a minor role in comparison with the zoomorphic parts, so that the inscriptions of this piece can hardly be classed with the usual (and relatively later) human-headed variety. The two versions on the Heeramaneck platter stand thus be- tween the ornithomorphic and human-headed varieties. Zoomorphic features are one aspect of what Rice calls the animated script, but they are usually overshadowed by the more specta- cular human figures. As to the animated script on the Wade Cup itself, it should be pointed out that, in spite of its apparently unique character in the realm of Persian art, it shows, nevertheless, certain features which link it with other inscriptions. First, for instance, the initial word, al-'izz, in its over-all appearance is, if we discount its fanciful elaboration, not too far from the form that we find on the Freer pen case of 12IO. In both inscriptions we have an over-long stem for the td mvrbs7tah, and finally, the $ad in l1ithibihi is identical in both inscriptions. Even the faulty form dV'im (instead of da'iman70) is peculiar to both, quite apart from the fact that we have in both cases long lists of good wishes which are also found, for instance, on the Bobrinsky Bucket. The "human-headed" script is important for this discussion insofar as it occurs concurrently with the animated script, and appears, though in a position of minor importance, on the foot of the Wade Cup. It is felt by this writer that in the discussion of this particular script two additional pieces, undated though they are, should be considered. There is, first, the inkwell made by Nasir ibn As'ad Naysbhirl, which shows on the top of its cover, around the central decoration, the perhaps most unusual rendition of this type of script.7' In spite of the fact that 70 For the correct spelling see Sarre, Erzeugnisse islamischer Kunst, I. Metal, p. I2 (No. I7); Kiihnel, Zwei Mosulbronzen und i/r Meister, p. 6 (fourth inscription). 71 Aga-Oglu, op. cit., fig. 4.</page><page sequence="45">358 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN the published photograph is rather indistinct, it is clear that the human heads are not as stereotyped as they are on other specimens, but represent both profile and three-quarter views, with a special type of coiffure for each position. Such heads appear not only in the usual manner on top of the hastae, but in the case of the alif- ldm combination of the article a single head shown in three-quarter view terminates both letters. The heads appear also as a terminal ending of the low letters and even as an integral part of them, as for instance the rounded part of the 'ayn in wal-sa'ddah. In addition, the craftsman placed a series of three heads on a line above the letter sin. Although the human elements in the script are of major importance, there seem to be also a few animal heads in- corporated in it. Altogether the writing on this object is, in its way, as unique and original as that on the Wade Cup, but here the east Iranian origin can hardly be doubted. The other undated example is to be found in the top register of an inlaid Persian brass vase in the British Muse- um,72 which is close to certain of the polygonal ewers, of which the only dated one is from the year II82 and made by Malimutd b. Muhammad Haravi. This particular inscription-"human- headed" and "inhabited"-is of significance for our discussion inasmuch as here the letter sfn does not consist of the mere heads of birds, as on the Wade Cup and in a more degenerated form on the cup of Khalaf ibn (sic) Jfilaki in Naples and on a tray in Cleveland, but repre- sents three whole birds. In this example the td mdrbfitah, with its round part biting its straight stem, and the oblique open forms of the mim, are, however, close to the same letters on the Wade Cup. Finally, in this inscription the dragons on the top of some hastae still threaten birds, as they do on the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63 and as is proper for this kind of iconography. Here we have, obviously, an in- scription close to the Wade Cup and possibly somewhat earlier, although the difference in 72 Barrett, op. cit., pl. 8; Harari, op. cit., pi. I3I7, B. time might be minimal. Both pieces have also this in common, that they are covered with a very dense design which leaves very little undec- orated background space, and that they use a "pecking bird" as a space filler. In their horror vacui these two pieces are quite different, for instance, from the Freer pen case of 12IO, and more akin to the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63. The third variety of writing discussed by Rice is called by him "inhabited naskhi writing." According to his definition, in this script animal figures "are inserted as figures between the letters and take the place of ornamental scrolls. They constitute a background to the lettering and do not form an integral part of the script" (p. 22). They are therefore a somewhat different type of script because in the other examples either human or animal forms were fused with the letters. They are, however, an expression of the same ornamental tendency and, as Dr. Rice has rightly pointed out, the animals of this script are very often combined either with the animated or human-headed script. Since in the background of most of the illustrated examples one can still make out vestigial traces of scroll- work, and it is even sometimes plainly visible (as in Rice's figure 27), it seems, however, too strong an expression to state that the animals take the place of ornamental scrolls. Actually the inscription from Baku (Rice's figure 24) is his only example which fits his definition com- pletely, but this, being a monumental stone in- scription in a border region, may well be a special case. This combination of animals with naskhi writing also occurs occasionally on pot- tery, as for instance, on a dark-blue glazed jar in the possession of Mr. K. Rabenou of New York, in which various birds, a "harpy" and a small deer are placed between the writing (fig. 35). This piece shows that "inhabited" naskhi writing is a type of naskhi in which the scroll- work of the background is inhabited by animals, except that in certain instances the scrollwork appears in a very reduced scale. At this point one might quite properly ask:</page><page sequence="46">THE WADE CUP 359 How did this writing come about, especially as it is so unusual and, in a way, contrary to the spirit of Islam? As a tentative answer one could suggest the following: since we know now that its earliest examples occurred in Khorasan in the tenth century, we had best look for further clues in the art of that period and in that region. Here we find within the decorative schemes of Nishapur large human eyes in combination with arabesques73 or tendrils ending in human hands, in other words, anthropomorphic features ap- plied for whatever reasons to decorative schemes.7' We also find that certain stucco decorations have intimations of birds' heads,75 very much in the way in which we found them on one of the hemispherical bronze bowls. Although we have not yet come across other examples of human forms in the arts of Khora- san in the subsequent periods, the application of animal heads to objects or decorative panels is quite common in the eleventh to twelfth centuries. Bird heads appear on the sides of incense burners and lamp fixtures (fig. 38) on the handles of buckets, on the covers of jugs, or we have bottles with caprine or bovine heads, or we find bovine heads on the handles of mortars.76 It was only natural that in a civili- 73 W.

The example described in this article shows two highly stylized bird-wheel patterns (in the outside panels); they are akin to the design in the interior of the metal bowl in this writer's collection (fig.

The connection of the bird with "light" is well demon- strated by its application to various forms of lamps. I am reproducing here an Iranian polycandelon of the zation bent on imparting such zoomorphic and even anthropomorphic features to its decorative arts a tendency of this sort should eventually appear on decorative inscriptions of secular nature, primarily applied to private objects. Since from very early times on and still in the Islamic period the bird has auspicious connotations-as the sunbird, simurgh, or enemy of the chthonic snake or dragon-77 it was also natural that one of the earliest, if not the first, animal form to be applied to writing should be a bird, and even that it was then applied to the word barakah,78 which in Islamic fashion tries to vouchsafe the same kind of auspicious effect that the bird symbol was thought to have rendered in earlier civilizations. Seljuq period in the Walters Art Gallery (fig. 38). It shows complete birds and bird heads just as in the types of writing here under discussion. The convention of applying animal parts to vessels is, however, much older than the Seljuq period, although it became quite common then. The Freer Gallery of Art owns, for instance, a "Sasanian type" bronze ewer probably of the early Islamic period (No. 45.I3), the handle of which ends in an antelope head at both ends. 77 I read a paper on this subject ("Bird and snake symbolism in Islamic art") at the annual meeting of the College Art Association in Baltimore, on January 27, I949, which, however, was not published, as I am collecting further data. The topic has now been expertly treated by S. V. R. Cammann in his article in this volume (vol. 2) of Ars Orientalis (Ancient sym- bols in modern A fghanistan), where other investigations in this field are also mentioned. 78There are two interesting variations on this theme: The Metropolitan Museum owns a pottery bowl found during their excavations in Nishapur in which the word barakah (minus the final loop of the ta marbitah) is given as a repeat pattern on the rim while a bird in the same style (see particularly its wings shaped like the hastae of the writing above it) is placed in the center, as if it, too, were a form of barakah or at least its equivalent (Charles K. Wilkinson, Fashion and technique in Persian pottery, Bulletin of the Metro- politan Museum of Art, n. s., vol. 6 [I947-48], fig. on p. ioi). The second variation is to be found on a bowl in the same general style (Freer Gallery of Art, No. 56.I), in which the word barakah is inscribed in Kfifc in two confronted birds (Ettinghausen, Inter- action and integration in Islamic art, pl. IO, a).</page><page sequence="47">360 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN VI. THE OVER-ALL THEME OF THE WADE CUP'S DECORATION After this survey of the various motifs applied to the Wade Cup, a more general question should be raised, namely, what should be re- garded as their programme or purpose. An ex- amination of the categories of the decorations reveals the fact that they fall into a few groups, which are listed below, together with their probable implications or connotations: A: THE ISLAMIC ASPECT (I) In three different places, various expres- sions of blessing and good wishes for the owner of the vessel are given in Arabic-the language of the Koran and the prayers, of the educated and the central government. There are no other more specifically Islamic elements present, especially none with religious overtones, with the exception of the Buraq aspect of the sphinx- es. B: DECORATIVE FEATURES OF MAGIC ORIGIN (I) Signs of the zodiac. They have, for all their decorative purpose, still strong magic and apotropaic implications. (2) Knot forms. These appear six times in interstices of the wide bands on the outside of the vessel and as part of the finials of the i2 radiating elements of the interior. A knot is also formed by the interlaced wings of the four sphinxes. These knots are again a feature which is both decorative and magic and as such they occur in other work from Khorasan of that and preceding periods.79 Their magic character is, 79 E.g., on the pen box of 12IO (Herzfeld, op. cit., fig. i, side view of the pen box between signature and date, and fig. 5), also on the Tiflis ewer of ii82. A big knot in dark-brown slip appears as the single deco- rative unit on a large round pottery plate from Nishapur, from the tenth or early eleventh century, in the Freer Gallery of Art (No. 53.70, text fig. X). The diameter of this plate is I23/4 inches (324 mm.) and that of the central knot 53/4 inches (I46 mm.). however, clearly established since they occur on magic bowls.80 The heart-shaped version has also a close connection with the signs of the zodiac in whose proximity it here occurs. It is found in the figures of Sagittarius and Cancer, where it represents a mythological aspect sym- bolizing a dragon.8' (3) The wheel motif with winged sphinxes surrounded by a series of fishes, birds, and other animals and framed by I2 rays. The revolving motif and the combination of a winged animal, usually a bird, with fishes, and finally a wheel or star motif are again age-old. They had originally a magic purpose and are clearly of solar character. These motifs kept their basic meaning through the ages down to the Muslim FIG.

(4) Birds as space fillers in the lower and minor interstices of the swathing bands. Al- though now mainly a decorative element, they too have a submerged symbolical meaning and are of auspicious nature. C: THE PLEASANT ASPECTS OF LIFE (I) Merrymaking, such as drinking, playing the harp, tambourine, and flute, and various forms of dancing; one of the latter suggests a sword dance, but there are also other forms of the use of arms, some apparently for shooting birds, or for fighting, as entertainment or in earnest. All these elements are found in mixed fashion in the anthropomorphic parts of the animated inscription. (2) The animals on the bands, i.e., antelopes and birds, and dogs and cheetahs to chase them. They form, foremost, a decorative pattern but by being connected with the hunt evoke a most pleasant aspect of life, the excitement of track- ing down the game and chasing it with dog and cheetah. (3) Fantastic animals like sphinxes and harpies on the swathing bands and harpies and other fabulous animals as part of the animated inscription. The mediaeval onlookerprobably did not regard them as imaginary but rather as strange and fascinating, indicating man's quest of foreign countries in the service of commerce and of his acquisition of unusual knowledge while mastering all the problems of the voyage.82 Khorasan, being the main thoroughfare between the Muslim heartland and central Asia, India 82 See the Kitab 'A ja'ib al-Hind, newly translated by J. Sauvaget and posthumously published in Me- morial Jean Sauvaget, Damas, I954, vol. I, pp. I90-309; about this Arabic work see now Cesar E. Dubler, A Ite arabische Berichte fiber den Fernen Osten......... Asiatische Studien, Atudes Asiatiques, vol. 8 (I954), pp. 5I-69. and the Far East, was a natural place for the lore of such fabulous animals. The common denominator of these various themes is the hope for and the auspicious evo- cation of a pleasant, successful and long-lasting life without sickness and misfortune. This is basically expressed in the words and pictorial aspect of the long inscription on the outside, which is given in the language of the official religion. To assure this desired aim the artist did not, however, make further appeals to Allah, but to cosmic forces whose powers are invoked with the age-old symbols of the pagan substrata. There is no better way to translate this appeal from pictorial to verbal language than to have it voiced by an inscription on an object of the same general period. This is done by a verse within a short poem on a metal basin of about I400 in Berlin: oli' I V I ,. I J "I j Y "May destiny and the spheres in the(ir) course(s) affecting you never lead to mis- fortunes" (Literally: "not cease not to overtake misfortunes," or perhaps, "never bypass any remarkable fortunate happen- ing (?).)3 83 E.

Jahrhunderts im Koniglichen Museum fiur Volkerkunde zu Berlin, Jahrbuch der K6niglich PreuBischen Kunstsammlungen, vol. 25 (I904), p. 70; corrections by idem in Sarre, Erzeugnisse islamischer Kunst.

Since this particular passage (the fourth line of the poem) proved to be very difficult, the writer is greatly indebted to Professor Franz Rosenthal of Yale University for help kindly given by him. His trans- lation, based on Mittwoch's reading, is quoted above. He adds that there is a possibility that the word awabid may be intended in its positive meaning (extraordinary events), and a reading in this sense is given above as a secondary translation. His general comment is that in view of these textual difficulties the last word may not yet have been said concerning the verse, but that whatever the exact translation may be, the meaning must be as indicated. The other four verses of the poem and final sentence were translated by Mittwoch as follows:</page><page sequence="49">362 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN While a visual invocation of the spheres appears also in the iconography of other pieces, it is then, as in the poem quoted below, intermixed with other topics, usually those of the various aspects of kingship. These features are lacking in the Wade Cup, which, together with its anonymous character, indicates that it is a nonroyal piece. That an object showing such a wealth of ideas and such fine workmanship fitted the taste and pocket of the Iranian middle class is shown by the even more sumptuous Bobrinsky Bucket in the Hermitage, which was made in Herat for a merchant.84 It has often been stated that the special quality of oriental literature lies not in its originality but in the skillful manner in which well-known parts are put together and in how, through an unexpected turn or combination, new vistas of thought and imagination are opened up. This applies just as well to the fine arts, and the Wade Cup is an excellent example, with its great wealth of traditional detail com- posed in an unusual manner. For example, i. Ruhm und Gliick mogen dauern und langes Leben Dir, o Herr, erhaben an Macht. 2. Wohlergehen und ewig sich erneuerndes Gliick, um deiner Hoheit willen, der du reich bist an Verdiensten und Wohltaten. 3. Du bist derjenige, dessen Befehle die Konige gehorchen, bei dessen Herannahen sich frohe Botschaft geben die Menschen und Genien. 4 .......... 5. Und wenn Du befiehlst, gehorchen Deinem Befehle alle Existierenden im Geheimen und im Offen- baren. Und Sieg fiber die Feinde, Hoheit und reiche Wohltaten dem Besitzer. Mittwoch mentions that the text occurs (with wrong readings) also in M. Lanci, Trattato delle simboliche rappresentanze arabiche, Paris, I845-46, vol. 2, p. I46 (as this work is not available to me, I cannot state to which object Lanci's inscription is applied); finally, the first three lines are also to be found on a Persian bowl formerly in the Sarre Collection (Sarre, op. cit., p. 34, No. 72, p. 78) which indicates that this is the usual poem reflecting a common attitude. 84 R. Ettinghausen, The Bobrinski "Kettle," patron and style of Islamic bronze, Gazette des Beaux Arts, vol. 24 (I943), pp. I94, I99-200. Dr. Rice has pointed out that the outdoor and indoor activities depicted on the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63 are juxtaposed with inscriptions which incorporate the same aspects in their imagery (p. 25). In the animated inscription of the Wade Cup everything is now happily com- bined, and in the master's tour de force, outdoor and indoor activities and Arabic writing have become one integrated ensemble. In weighing all enumerated factors, one can conclude as follows: The artist managed in a skillful, spirited manner to combine and, in various places, even to interweave three themes of a Muslim's attitude to the world around him. In doing so he represented various aspects of Muslim civilization, whose religion also combines lofty ideas with primitive animistic and magic beliefs. VII. PROVENANCE AND DATE OF THE WADE CUP. It is now time to make the final deduction as to the place of production and date of the Wade Cup. It will be recalled that Rice's conclusion was northwest Persia (Azerbaijan or near the Caucasus) and the third decade of the thirteenth century. Throughout this discussion it has, however, become evident that a great deal of evidence points to East Iran and most likely to Khorasan as the place of production. Since these clues were rather dispersed throughout the preceding pages, it might be worthwhile to co- ordinate them now more systematically. A. BASIC CONSTRUCTION: (I) Casting.-At least one of the footless bowls has, on technical examination, been shown to be cast (fig. I5), but others of this group were probably also made in this way. One of them was made by an artist hailing from Sistan. These bowls are here regarded as the fore- runners of the Wade Cup, which is also cast.85 85 The technical examination which established that the writer's bowl (figs. I5-17) was made by</page><page sequence="50">THE WADE CUP 363 (2) Shape.-Two hemispherical footless bowls have been found in Afghanistan. The Peytel Cup of the same general shape but with a foot was made for a sadr of Khorasan, "almost certainly" in Khorasan. Footed bowls are repre- sented on the Bobrinsky Bucket made in Herat in II63, and this piece, too, has a foot of the same general character. B. DECORATION: (3) The bands.-Exact parallels to the swath- ing bands of the Wade Cup have so far not been found in metalwork, although they are possibly prefigured by the star designs made up of criss- crossing bands on the Kevorkian and Kabul bowls. The closest parallel so far tracked down is on a fragmentary ewer of the general type of the Tiflis ewer which came with the Sarre col- lection into the IslamischeAbteilung of the Berlin Museum.86 Simpler interlaced bands as found on the Vaso Vescovali form three roundels on the inkwell of Nasirb. Ascad Naysabiirl, and they ap- pear also on the footless bowl in Teheran (fig. 22). (4) Inscriptions.-Long lists of good wishes occur on the Bobrinsky Bucket and the Freer pen case, made for a vizier in Merv. On the Freer pen case appears the same grammatical mistake (dd'im) which occurs also on the Wade Cup. Inscriptions below the rim occur already on some of the earlier globular bowls without stem. The earliest known type of zoomorphic writ- ing occurs on pottery pieces found in Nishapur. casting was carried out by Mr. Rutherford J. Gettens of the Freer Gallery of Art in collaboration with Mr. G. A. Ellinger, Chief, Corrosion Section, and Mr. H. L. Logan, Metallurgist, both of the Department of Metallurgy, National Bureau of Standards. The writer does not feel qualified to give an opinion as to whether or not the alloys of the footless bowls, the stem cups, and of a type of northwest Persian candlesticks are identical and not to be found anywhere else. 86 Sarre, Erzeugnisse islamischer Kunst.

The earliest animated inscription is found on a bucket made in Herat. The most original form of the human-headed naskhi occurs on the inkwell of Nasir b. As'ad NaysTbhrl, and, finally, the inhabited writing is likewise found on the Herat bucket. In view of Khorasan's great, if not unique, inventiveness in the field of Muslim figural epigraphy, it seems very likely that the most original and highly developed animated inscription so far known should have been made in the same area, especially since certain basic forms of its underlying lettering are found on a piece from Khorasan, the Freer pen case, and zoomorphic and even anthropomorphic tenden- cies are endemic in the art of Khorasan. The human-headed naskhi found on the foot of the Wade Cup has parallels in similar in- scriptions on the shoulder of a ewer generally attributed to Khorasan,87 on the lower parts of two others,88 and on the foot of a fourth.89 (5) Figures of the zodiac.-They occur on one of the early large hemispherical bowls in the Kabul Museum, obviously of East Iranian origin. These zodiacal figures appear also on a fragmentary ewer in the Metropolitan Museum, which belongs to the same type as the one in Tiflis and whose Khorasanian origin is indicated by the flower vase that seems to be one of the hallmarks of metalwork of that region. (6) Knots.-They occur on the ewer in Tiflis and on the Freer pen case. They are already a feature of Nishapur pottery. (7) Birds.-They are a favorite motif in the decorative arts and writing of Khorasan. (8) Tassel-like frames, pointing up on top of a human-headed inscription and down below it, are found on a ewer of the Tiflis type.90 (g) Rotating motif and fish.-This decoration had occurred already on Nishapur pottery and 87 M.

I322.</page><page sequence="51">364 RICHARD ETTINGHAUSEN on a hemispherical bowl of an East Iranian type. (io) Sphinxes.-A wheel of four sphinxes with their wing tips interlocked occurs on a rec- tangular tray which for stylistic reasons should be assigned to Khorasan. A combination of three as a circular motif appears on the top of an inkwell made by Nasir b. As'ad NaysTiibri, two in a revolving pattern occur on a tray of a form characteristic of eastern Iran, and the single animal is found on the bottom of the fragmentary bottle by 'Abd al-Razzaq Naysa- b-iri in the Berlin Museum. While any single one of these clues probably would not in itself prove an origin in Khorasan, all together (and they comprise about every single aspect of the Wade Cup) they indicate that origin. Expressed in other words, it does not matter that some of the listed motifs occur also elsewhere and are, as for instance the knots, ubiquitous in the Muslim world. What counts is that these shapes and designs in their totality conform with the artistic language of eastern Iran and of Khorasan in particular, as we understand it at this time, and that there is no feature of the Wade Cup that seems foreign to that idiom. On the other hand, no similar large group of northwest Persian parallels dating from prior to the Mongol onslaught are known which would suggest an attribution to that region. More difficult is the question of the date. In considering it several factors which were brought out on earlier pages should be recalled: (i) The date of the oldest preserved piece of dated Kashan pottery of a related but not identical shape is not a terminus post quem. The Wade Cup can be older than I203. (2) Footed bowls appear already on the Bobrinsky Bucket of II63, which has also a foot of the same general shape. (3) The animated inscription of the Blacas Ewer of I232 is so much advanced and in a way degenerated as an inscription that it seems most unlikely that there should be a difference of only from 3 to I2 years between it and the Wade Cup, as assumed by Rice. The difference be- tween the two seems to me longer. (4) It is generally agreed that the Wade Cup is older than the Peytel Cup, which was at- tributed by Max van Berchem to the early thirteenth century. (5) If our assumption that the piece was made in Khorasan is correct, it must follow that it would be before the early I220's, because in i22i Merv and Nishapur crumbled before the onslaught of the Mongols and in i222 Herat was destroyed. However, it is difficult to judge how far back from these dates one should go. The Freer pen case is too different in its style to furnish any definite clues. The same can be said about the ewer in Tiflis of ii82, although it presents at least the same idea of braiding around areas with major figural decorations as the Wade Cup. The one-handled jug made for 'Uthman ibn Salman of Nakhchevan in II90, in the Louvre,91 shares only the motif of the lemon-shaped figure with an ovoid undecorated center, a triangular base, and a finial which occurs i2 times in the Wade Cup's interior. In common with the Bobrinsky Bucket of 1163, the Wade Cup has the animated inscription, which is, however, more advanced in the Cleve- land piece. In the lower part of the Hermitage piece there are also confrontations of animals which, in their style, are not unlike those applied to the swathing bands on the Wade Cup, al- though the latter are again more diversified and spirited.92 What is even more important is the general appearance of the two pieces. Both have not only a dense over-all ornamental scheme but one in which no units have an ac- centuated position in the manner in which medallions stand out on the Blacas Ewer, the Munich basin of Badr al-Din Lu'lu', and other Mesopotamian and Syrian metal pieces.

Even on the Freer pen case, which is also imbued with a certain horror vacui, the different sizes of the various themes and the care with which they are clearly set apart from each other reveal an intent to differentiate and grade. There are, however, too few dated pieces in existence to state just how long this dense style of the Bobrinsky Bucket prevailed. In spite of the enumerated points of inter- relationship, there are still too few compelling arguments to narrow down safely the terminal limits of the date: sometime after 1163 and before 122I. In view of the connections with thirteenth-century derivatives of the Wade Cup, the date eventually established could be closer to I22I than to II63. Our tentative conclusion is, therefore, that the piece was made sometime around I200. A more specific and yet reliable attribution will have to wait until other dated pieces from the second half of the twelfth or the early thirteenth century have been found. On the other hand, the relative date of pro- duction is less difficult to grasp. The Wade Cup as an art object was possible when there existed certain economic and intellectual conditions. There had to be large urban centers with highly accomplished metalworkers supplying the needs of an educated, well-to-do middle class. Such conditions existed in Khorasan, particularly in Herat and Nishapur. There had to be, in addition, a special concern with the heavenly bodies. This existed on two levels. There was a specific concern for astronomy, proof of which is a number of distinguished astronomers living in Khorasan in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, such as al- Khazini, Muhammad al-Kharaql, and al-Muzaf- far al-TIsL.93 A general interest in astronomy is also implied by a relatively large number of illuminated manuscripts of Sufli's Kitab suwar 93G. Sarton, Introduction to the history of science, Baltimore, I927-48, vol. 2, part I, pp. 204-205, 2I6; part 2, pp. 622-623. al-kawdkib, dating from before the Mongol Conquest.94 The other form of interest in the heavenly bodies was astrological and magical. There was a great vogue for this approach at this period from the highest to the lowest social levels. This is shown by the various signs of the zodiac applied for magic purposes to the coins,95 to many fine vessels of clay and metal,96 and also by the simple magic bowls which specifically state that they are made under propitious astrological conditions and depict them with celestial symbols.97 Earlier in the twelfth centu- ry 'Adnan al-'Aynzarb! (died 548 H./iI53) had written a treatise on the application of "the science of the celestial sphere" ('irm al-falak) to medicine98 and in 595 H./II98-99 a whole poem, NizdmI's Haft Peykar, was composed by a contemporary of the Master of the Wade Cup, which had as its basic theme the conforming of life to astrological principles.99 The historical setting explains also the aes- thetic aspect of the Cleveland vessel, especially of its decoration. The shape is dependant on the function which is here, as in many other cases, not easy to establish. The evidence of Persian 94K.

This interpretation im- mediately raises a question, because if we as- sume that the Cleveland dish once served a Khorasanian merchant as a nut bowl, how would we account for the rich, dense, and potent decoration which in its fullness seems rather exaggerated for such a purpose. When con- sidering this argument it is best to leave aside modern aesthetic considerations and to rely alone on the contemporary point of view. It is here again that Nizami's romances give us a clue. The poet's supercharged style ressembles a very rich and dense embroidery in which one unusual image follows the other. As Hellmut Ritter's masterly analysis has shown, Nizam1, 1 See, e.g., the scene of "Key Khosrow and the Minstrel" in the Shah-nameh MS. of 833 H./I429-30 in the Golestan Library in Teheran. (For the best re- production, see now B. Gray and Andr6 Godard, [ran. Persian miniatures, Imperial Library, UNESCO World Art Series, Paris, I956, p1. 6). Although this miniature is more than 200 years later than the dish in Cleveland, it can be taken for granted that the traditional use of the vessel remained the same, even though the shape had changed. 2 The term "cup" used in the recent monograph in preference to the "bowl" of the Ann Arbor catalogue of I943 (Metalwork from Islamic countries, p. I3, No. 43) implies a drinking vessel; but neither the miniatures nor the traditional shapes of Iranian drinking vessels seem to indicate such a function which is also contradicted by the covers of the Vaso Vescovali and of the enameled glass vessel of the Kevorkian Foundation (Ettinghausen, The unicorn, p1. 20). moreover, transforms each and every event by means of an endless series of optically decorative metaphors into actions of profound purpose, imbued with new significance and relationships.3 Although this poetry far surpasses the figural arts in richness of detail and variety of as- sociations, the all-over impression of the "style" in both media is similar; and, just as in the poetry, everyday events are transfigured into more meaningful happenings by the use of imaginatively worded metaphors, so are an ordinary bucket for the hammam4 and a bowl for nuts elevated by the imagery of the highest (i. e., royal) form of physical life and of cosmic power, themes which were chosen for very specific reasons. On the other hand, it should also not be forgotten that in poetry the effect of the various metaphors is too powerful, when considered by themselves and especially in a translation, since in Persian many of these verbal pictures had become clich6s; in the same manner many of the individual decorative features applied to the vessel are traditional, even stereotyped, hence were probably not as forceful in conveying their message as the motif in "archaeological isolation" implies. As already stated above (p. 362) it is rather in the way in which the different age-old symbols are indi- vidually varied and combined in novel fashion that the originality of the work of art appears. Here the Master of the Wade Dish has made a unique contribution, so much so that the various aspects of his work have influenced many other artisans and this not only in Iran, but even in far-away Syria. 3 Ritter, op. cit. 4 Ettinghausen, The Bobrinski "kettle," p. 203.</page><page sequence="54">ARS ORIENTALIS II ERRATA Page 36I, 2d paragraph, last line: Change "I400" to early fourteenth century.</page></plain_text>
