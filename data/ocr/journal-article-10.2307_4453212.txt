Gotschlich From The Rockefeller University, New York, New York The detailed study of the molecular biology of the mechanisms that pathogenic orga- nisms employ to successfully parasitize their hosts has been very productive. An impor- tant part of the microbe's armamentarium is the ability to partially or totally evade one or more of the normal defenses of the host. While it is obvious that the molecular en- tities that produce these effects have an evolutionary history, as yet little attention has been devoted to this aspect. The study of the selective conditions that have given rise to a particular pathogenic property affords important perspectives on the process of mutual adaptation of the host and the parasite. The mechanisms that microorganisms use to evade the defenses of mammalian hosts have been re- viewed extensively [1-5]. Table 1 presents an in- complete summary of both the well-established and the supposed defenses of the human or animal host. Listed as well are the presumed means of evasion that have been attributed to various orga- nisms. A few relevant examples of bacteria and of the molecules mediating the effect are given. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail the mechanisms of evasion illustrated; the reader is referred to the review articles mentioned above and the references indicated in the table. Only a few mechanisms will be highlighted-primarily to emphasize that the host-parasite relationship sets bounds for the effectiveness of the strategies of bacterial evasion. Generally there has been an understandable tendency to look intensively at one facet of host defenses, such as phagocytosis, and to cast this interaction in a form of a battle, with victors and losers decided by the outcome of the encounter. However, this anthropomorphic view causes a degree of misapprehension because it tends to overlook the evolutionary background of the process. The host-parasite relationship is more profitably described as a long-standing adapta- tion. When considering the potential mechanism a microbe might employ to counter host defenses, an important point to remember is the host range of the organism. If the range of the organism is limited to a single species or to a few very similar species, there is a strong negative selective pressure against those that are overwhelmingly virulent. These pressures include the decimation of the host species, the lower probability of the microbe find- ing its way from a dead to a live host, and-in modern times-the probability that the clone will be eliminated by antibiotic treatment. Species of bacteria that are markedly pathogenic are only those that have another habitat or reservoir. This may include the ability to become a spore, the hardiness to survive in the environment, or the presence of another host in which the organism behaves as a commensal or as a low-intensity pathogen. Even in these situations, the adaptive process favors a moderated attack so the popula- tion density of the microbe is able to reach high levels before causing the demise of the host. When considering pathogens restricted to a single host species, we are urged by this ecological point of view to reconsider the locale in the host and the circumstances that have selected for the properties of bacterial virulence. Thus, the resis- tance of pneumococci to phagocytosis is a proper- ty that was not selected as a result of the ability of the resistant organism to cause overwhelming sepsis, but rather as a result of the advantage that this property gives it in establishing itself in sub- mucosal locations and in the respiratory tract. We can view that the central concern of the single- reservoir organism is the ability to be transmitted from host to host. The organism must strike a balance in regard to its virulence such that a bac- terial density is produced that maximizes transmis- The work has been supported in part by grant no.

The cost of this balance is that in those in- stances in which the organism encounters a host whose defenses are below average serious disease ensues and this diminishes or abrogates the ability of the organism to find a new host. This situation is excellently illustrated by the meningococcus, which is commonly encountered as an inhabitant of the nasopharynx of young adults but is rarely found among children younger than age four [32].</page><page sequence="3">S780 Gotschlich Yet it is in this latter population that the frequency of systemic disease is highest. Another striking example of the dichotomy between the main reservoir, where selection is operating, and disease is given by Escherichia coli of capsular type K1. Glode et al. [33] demonstrated that nearly 80% of cases of neonatal E. coli meningitis are caused by K1 organisms and that these organisms are en- countered in r35% or more of fecal samples from normal adults. Achtman [34], in a study of meningeal isolates obtained both in the United States and in Europe, found that two serotypes (018:K1:H1 and 07:K1:H4) predominated and represented ~20O% of the strains. On studying the profiles of the outer membrane protein, plasmid populations, and metabolic markers of these strains, he found that within each of the serotypes indicated above there was marked homogeneity, with organisms that are isolated from widely dis- parate geographic areas being almost indistin- guishable. The implication of these findings is that a set of attributes that renders an organism viru- lent occurs infrequently and that once established is remarkably stable. It might be important to reconsider the anatom- ic localization at which selective forces have op- erated in evolution in another instance, i.e., the production of IgA protease. Blake et al. [35] dem- onstrated that this enzyme is active in vivo in women infected with gonococci. The assumption has been that the purpose served by this enzyme is the inactivation of surface immunoglobulin. How- ever, if so, it is curious that so few organisms have evolved or acquired by genetic interchange this seemingly useful evasion [36, 37]. It also is puzzling that the majority of the organisms that possess this enzyme also have an appreciable po- tential for invasiveness. Lastly, from the specifi- city of the enzyme for the hinge region of the IgA [36], one would guess that the enzyme would be tailor-made to abrogate some Fc-mediated func- tion, a supposition that leads us to the problem that little is known about IgA-Fc-mediated functions. With our present knowledge, in many instances it is impossible to understand the selective advan- tage afforded by certain virulence factors. For in- stance, Clostridium perfringens [38] is a common organism in the normal intestinal flora, readily achieving population densities of 109/g of feces in perfectly healthy individuals. However, the or- ganism is capable of causing fatal intoxication in individuals who, due to nutritional factors, lack trypsin in their intestinal tract. In addition, if inoculated in the presence of necrotic tissue, the organism produces collagenase, hyaluronidase, hemolysin, phospholipase C, neuraminidase, and several toxins that increase vascular permeability. It is difficult to understand the selective condi- tion(s) in which this constellation of toxins pro- vides an advantage to the organism; just because there exists in a bacterium a mechanism for neu- tralization of a defense system that we usually associate with the bloodstream or with the internal milieu, it is unlikely that such a mechanism evolved for neutralization of this defense in deep tissues but rather it is more likely that this evasion has evolved as a way of avoiding an analogous de- fense in the first layers of a mucosal surface. It should also be kept in mind that, as a rule, the toxins of gram-positive organisms are the result of lysogenization with specific bacteriophages. There- fore, it is probably more profitable to ask of what advantage the toxins are to the success of the virus. Direct inactivation of a relevant host defense system is obviously one mechanism by which to evade its effect, and an example of such a mech- anism might be the production of IgAi protease. Other examples are the toxins that kill polymor- phonuclear phagocytes outright. However, it is noteworthy that this total abrogation of a particu- lar defense mechanism-particularly one invol- ving a central defense-is utilized rather infre- quently. For instance, the action of cobra venom factor indicates that it is possible to completely inactivate the complement system in the circula- tion, yet no microbe appears to have developed such an evasive mechanism. The closest approxi- mation of functional complement inactivation in vivo is found in infected empyema fluids, in which complement activity is quite low; detectable levels of C3d fragment are present, a finding that speaks for the presence of proteolysis-most likely by a host protease [15]. A method for dealing with the recognition func- tion of antibody that is more common is the evolu- tion of antigenic heterogeneity, a means of eva- sion that is of no use to a particular clone but of clear value to the species. This strategy presents the microbe with an interesting problem; it must preserve the function of the component in ques-</page><page sequence="4">Evasion of Host Defenses S781 tion while altering it antigenically, a problem I would like to discuss in relation to pili. Antigenic heterogeneity has been observed in K88 pili, man- nose-resistant pili, and gonococcal pili [39, 40]. As a rule, antisera prepared to purified gonococcal pili of one strain cross-react r22%-3% with the pili of other strains. In gonococci the pilus sero- logic type appears almost strain specific; there is clear evidence that the pili of different strains dif- fer in primary structure. Hermodson et al. [41] have shown that the sequence of the first 29 amino acids are identical in a number of gonococcal pili. Schoolnik et al. [42] have sequenced the first 49 residues of two serologically different pili and found them to be identical to those reported pre- viously. The question poses itself, How can pili differ antigenically as much as they do and yet maintain their morphology and their ability to bind specifically to human cells? We have obtained some answers to this question by taking advantage of the fact that gonococcal pili generally contain two methionine residues, one at position 7 and the second at approximately position 97. With use of CNBr it is possible to ob- tain three fragments, CB-1, which is the N-ter- minal heptapeptide; CB-2, a peptide of 0090 amino acids; and CB-3, the carboxy-terminal pep- tide of r80 amino acids. With use of HAI assays, it can be shown that CB-2 isolated from the pili of one strain competitively inhibits the hemaggluti- nation caused by purified pili of all gonococcal strains tested, a finding that indicates that CB-2 contains the ligand-binding site. CB-3 had no in- hibitory effect on such hemagglutination. When peptide maps of CB-2 fragments isolated from two serologically unrelated strains of gonococci were compared, we found that 87?%o of the pep- tides were identical. On the other hand, a compar- ison of the CB-3 fragments indicated that only 50% of the peptides were identical. We have raised antisera in rabbits using purified CB-2 and CB-3 as immunogens. The antisera to CB-3 re- acted only with the CB-3 used for immunization and to the intact pili of that strain. The antiserum behaved very much like one prepared against in- tact pili. However, the serum raised against CB-2 reacted strongly with all purified pili tested or their CB-2 fragments.' Thus it appears that the binding function of pili is mediated by a portion of the pili subunit that is fairly constant in struc- ture and that if this subunit is separated from the variable carboxy-terminal end of the molecule the antibodies to it are highly cross-reactive. Since the binding site on the constant portion probably is exposed (or it would be unable to act as a binding site), it is surprising that the variable region masks its immunogenic potential so effectively. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon deserves further study. A picture of a different mechanism by which function can be kept constant in the vast array of serologic differences is emerging in regard to M proteins. Manjula and Fischetti [43] have shown that the amino acid sequence of several types of M protein has an important recurring feature, name- ly a seven amino acid periodicity of hydrophobic amino acids and the paucity of residues that inter- rupt the a-helix. These cause the molecule to form a-helices with a hydrophobic ridge on one side and hydrophilic groups on the other. Two such mole- cules then interact by hydrophobic interactions to form a coiled-coil structure. This structure, which has been shown to be present in M protein [44], is characteristic of tropomyosin and can be recog- nized by x-ray diffraction studies. Thus, if one postulates that the functional attribute of M pro- tein depends on its coiled-coil structure, this con- formation can be achieved with entirely different amino acid sequences that hence can have very dif- ferent antigenic characteristics. It has been proposed that borreliae, which cause relapsing fever, may exhibit the phenomenon of antigenic variation; this is based on the observa- tion that during the repeated relapses the microbe appears to be antigenically different [12]. Anti- genic variation has been studied most intensively in trypanosomes. These organisms also cause cyclical diseases, and serologically different forms are isolated from patients in relapse [45]. The vari- ation affects a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of r65,000 that is expressed in high con- centration on the surface; when variation in the glycoprotein occurs, there are major changes in the isoelectric point, amino acid composition, and N-terminal sequence. Cloned trypanosomes show this variation as well, and perhaps as many as several hundred surface antigens can be produced. The variation is incompatible with any mutation hypothesis. Rather it appears that a finite number 1 G. K. Schoolnik and E. C.

Whether antibody af- fects the rate of variation or simply selects variants has not been settled. In sum, the point of these remarks is to encour- age those interested in pathogenesis to broaden their perspective on the molecular mechanisms by which evasion of host defenses is accomplished by trying to understand the ecologic circumstances and evolutionary pressures that shaped the aspect of the host-parasite relationship under investigation.
