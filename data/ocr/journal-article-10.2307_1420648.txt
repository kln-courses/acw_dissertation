<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Edited by W. C. H. PRENTICE, Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts Signals in the Animal World. By DIETRICH BURKHARDT, WOLFGANG SCHLEIDT, and HELMUT ALTNER. With the collaboration of Helmut Albrecht, Karl Daumer, Ireniius Eibl-Eibesfeldt, Klaus Hoffmann, Werner Jacobs, Arthur A. Myrberg, Jr., Maximilian Renner, Friedrich Schaller, Hermann Sch6ne, Johann Schwartzkopff, Gernot Wendler, and Wolfgang Wickler. Translated by Kenneth Morgan. New York, McGraw-Hill, 1967. Pp. 150. $10.00. Most immediately apparent in this book are its stunningly beautiful illustrations, particularly the 32 full-page color photographs. Every one of the 32 chapters has one color photograph, one or more black-and-white photographs on another full page, and one to three small line-drawings. This wealth of illustration makes the book just as attractive as any of the so-called gift books. Furthermore, its highly readable, informative, and eminently unstuffy text almost never lags for the reader. It will certainly provide an exciting and stimulating reading experience for any scientifically oriented layman as well as for students in courses on perception, comparative psy- chology, behavioral biology, or introductory ethology. The subject of animal be- havior generally has a universal appeal, and now, with the currently expanding interest in ethological methods and findings among psychologists in this country, this book has particular relevance, for its various chapters are written by highly regarded and authoritative ethologists. The book compares sensory processes in human and infrahuman species and describes the nature of behavioral reactions to sensory information received from the environment. Particularly important in the second category is the competent coverage, in 12 chapters, of what is currently known about infrahuman animal language. Furthermore, the book is highly valuable in that it puts together a large amount of material which is not together anywhere else and treats it comprehensively. There are occasional ellipses, awkward or inappropriate terms, faulty punctuations, and mixed tenses in the text, most of them due to the process of translation. Also, there are some instances in which the words chosen by the translator have a decidedly anthropomorphic connotation that could not have been intended in the original German. These occasional flaws do provide unfortunate distractions from the book's full worth. Nevertheless they should not deter anyone from utilizing this book completely, as it deserves to be.
