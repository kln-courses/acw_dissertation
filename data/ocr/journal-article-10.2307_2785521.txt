<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPONTANEITY Adolf Meyer Johns Hopkins Hospital EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Meyer presented this paper in the form of an address as part of the program of the Mental Hygiene Division of the Illinois Conference on Public Welfare at Chicago, October, 1933, and it was published by the Program Committee of the Conference in a pamphlet entitled: 'A Contribution of Mental Hygiene to Education.' SOCIOMETRY is greatly indebted to Dr. Meyer for permission to reprint important passages from this sig- nificant contribution and thus to bring his remarks again before a scientific public. ELEMENTALISM AND HOLISM In the face of a mood that has led science to seek progress largely in the direction of elementalism, the sense for units or totalities through integration has not made equal progress. The sense for totalities has been exaggerated be- fore in philosophic and religious and animistic thinking. It had to undergo and face a deflation. Today it is at an unnecessar- ily low ebb in scientific concern, and has not as yet absorbed as much of the concept of integration as it well might. And among people who are not specifically scientific, comprehen- sive concepts are side-stepped or at least are inactive and rarely cultivated. For long periods in historically accessible time the larger units accredited with initiation and spontaneity were shaped in terms of gods or spirits; and St. Thomas Aquinas began his description of the spontaneous forces of the universe with a discussion of God and then in the second place proceeded to discuss the nature of the angels in terms of eter- nity, and only in the third place the readily accessible nature of man. The big forces among mankind figured as dynasties dei gratta and in more humanized Greece as oligarchies and tyrannies. With the rise of the individual as a real concern and not a mere chattel (i.e., chief or capital "movable belong- ing"), there came rearrangements of integration, with unit for- mation, biologically and socially regulated by heredity and 150</page><page sequence="2">SPONTANEITY 151 inheritance, or by appointment (selection) or election or usurpa- tion, with concentration of power in the hands of a despot, the dictator of modern times, or the boss or the political party; with centralization or decentralization; in short, there is a problem of the human dynamo--the centers of spontaneity and origination. In the principle of government and governed, of power, of law, of rule, or the freedom from rule in anarchy, in the principle of individualism, class rule or a variously gen- eral rule in democracy--we always find as the center the indi- vidual or group with spontaneity. Since the days of the great army, we have been too apt to think in terms of intelligence tests; but most of us have learned, I hope, to value spontaneity as especially vital in human evaluations, since we see some bright persons with high I.Q. flounder and many with low I.Q., although slower and limited, prove fully as worth while as their apparently more gifted fellows when dependability and final re- sult are considered. Similarly, in the same individuals, we see moods and attitudes of inactivity or of arousal and freedom and what we call and feel as spontaneity, as the very condition and foundation of spirits, readiness and action. I therefore feel it is worth while for us to direct our attention to this question of spontaneity, variously disciplined and balanced, which leads us to a further point, viz., that of the regulating factors in spontaneity. In these days when the teacher, the social worker, the psychiatrist are so eager to get the dependable and telling facts about a person, and when one speaks freely of instincts and hormones, of intelligence quotients, and the social setting and economics (for both consumers and producers) and earn- ings and employment and jobs, the degree and the kind of spontaneity become one of the most important items in the case--a commodity that differs widely from person to person and from time to time in most persons. By the person's spontaneity, I mean that which the per- son may be expected to rise to and to rise with on his own, asua sponte," with his 'spons" and "response" and finally "re- sponsibility." It is more than 'muscle twitch" or reflex, an incorporation and integration of wider relationships. Certainly both in our practical and our scientific habits of dealing with persons--with one's own self and with the many others--we like to express the needs and possibilities in terms of what the person has and does and what can be expressed as re- sources and possessions. The individual cannot profitably come to be largely an abstract center treated like a mathematical point, for, as a matter of fact, it is the way the personality</page><page sequence="3">152 SOCIOMETRY sums up as relatively active or inactive with its type of spon- taneity that determines the probable success or failure accord- ing to adaptation. We want to know what we may expect of a person at any moment, and in the course of time, on his or her own initiative and integrated organization; this expectation may be relatively or largely unpredictable but surely does not result from 'casual chance.' The type and the degree of emergent initiative and spon- taneity become a most vital concern, in view of the fact thatin the nature of the individual and group life there is always a setting, a past and a future, there are always the leaders and the led, and the fate of large numbers and of the various ranges of communities is usually largely dependent on a limit- ed number of individuals and the working of their spontaneities and the morale of the rest. The history of the last twenty years has been full of disciplined and undisciplined centers of spontaneity. We have to choose between spontaneity of a revo- lutionary type and spontaneity of an evolutionary type. So much of human life and nature is influenced by specific contingencies and combinations of events that much depends finally on the in- dividual's disciplined spontaneity. SCIENCE THE ADAPTATION OF DEPENDABLE METHODS AND CONCEPTS ADJUSTED TO THE TASK The whole development of psychobiological integration is a growth and differentiation of structure and functions with- in the bonds of heredity and mutation but with organization and integration of spontaneity. More than ever we realize that every mother has to face a new entity in her baby with its own and specific range of spontaneity. There shapes itself an or- ganism for action, guided by meaning functions in a plastic flow of more or less grasp and inclusion of the realities with consciousness, and subject function or personality function. What we call mind or, better, mentation is the specifically in- tegrated action itself and not merely action as the servant to an abstract self. To treat the action and integration facts as if they could be a special superentity is anthropomorphism. Each person proves to work as if with a constitutional govern- ment-, a bundle of forces to be won for cooperative action or turned off into an army, of revolt, with its energy and spon- taneity in harmony or out of harmony with itself, in more or less biographic unity, and at the same time a not altogether predictable agency for success or failure in the familial, social,</page><page sequence="4">SPONTANEITY 153 communal and national units--with a capacity or inadequacy of foresight and with biological and sociological conscience and conscientiousness as well as consciousness. It is spontaneity that I want to study and inquire into and cultivate and respect as the all important characteristic quality of a person. It is the range of spontaneity, with its range of dependability and the capacity to rise to the various ranges of occasions and demands and opportunities of life. Call it psychology or behavior-study or, as one of my pupils sug- gests, ergasiology (using ergasia as the term for mentally in- tegrated function)--organized common-sense allows us to reduce it all to terms of 'experiments of nature." Whether we study the units or the group or the part, the questions are always the same simple questions of critical inquiring common-sense: What is the fact? The conditions under which it occurs and shows? What are the factors entering and at work? How do they work? With what results? With what modifiability? This is a formula which does justice to the factors of both elementalism and integration, to hindsight as well as fore- sight, and to the spontaneity of chance and purpose, individual and social. If spontaneity is not an absolutely fixed quantity--only relatively constant--that is evidently the nature of this kind of fact and we must find the methods to do it justice. Spontaneity covers the range of performance to which the individual is able to rise in the continual status nascendi with the endless or at least ever available 'credits of time," within at least the range of expectancy of life, be it in mere waking up or in meeting any specific task or situation or op- portunity. In psychobiological study and work I should look for the capacity to see the problems and opportunities and to meet them constructively. Our intelligence tests bring out "the spontaneity in the face of a multiplicity of questions." An intelligence test of life is much more a real spon- taneity test than would be the case with any absolutely planned experiment; it is an experiment of nature with its mixture of necessity or determinism, chance and contingency with law and order of growth, and choice under the evolution of ever accum- ulating and self-maintaining experience, i.e., etymologically and factually "that which one is from having gone through" (:=ens,</page><page sequence="5">154 SOCIOMETRY peritus, ex) function and performance in changing and yet more or less balancing processes. VERBAL, CONCEPTUAL, AND FACTUAL IMPLICATIONS Somehow we cannot afford to let the case rest with a science of mere "happening." There was a time when the person's will power and en- ergy and naturalness were perhaps far too glibly spoken of and treated as if they were the function and activity of a kind of superagency in the person, a capacity more like verbal magic than reality. If we used these concepts as those do who speak of 'memory" as that which remembers, and of "volition" as that which "wills," we obviously would be indulging in mere verbal tautology. Spontaneity is not the generator, but evidence of generation. It refers to the dependencies as well as the in- dependencies of the agent's rising to performance and attain- ment. It points to a quality of the agent very much as "con- sciousness" points to a state of specific functional relatedness, and 'consensus" refers to a common intelligibility and goal--a condition to be treated as a question of fact, with a question whether it is or is not present in any case under consideration. The obligatory center is always as far as we know a living per- son or group of living persons with their spheres of varying implications and belonging and feeling and working together, and not simply a dried up abstract reduced to a mere mathematical intellectualistic point or a ghost made up in the image of our fancy. Unfortunately to speak of spontaneity sounds almost like heresy, like expecting something out of nothing. The term can readily be taken amiss as belonging to the category of free will, of spontaneous generation and the like. Even if in our childhood we were taught to hitch our wagon to a star of naifve absolutism and omnipotence of the personified infinite, we need not go from one extreme to another with equally naive blindness to facts. My thought is not of the ultimate of everything. It turns directly to the obvious fact that some things or persons have to be moved in order to move, while others show spon- taneity. The wisdom or natural sense for discrimination and creative thought shows some interesting facts in the evolution of the pertinent terms and what they draw upon of necessity in keeping with human nature. The word as such is of interest. When we see someone do things spontaneously, sua sponte, and (evidently using the</page><page sequence="6">SPONTANEITY 155 same root spons) responsibly, without extraneous suggestion or duress, but of one's own accord and nature, there is something involved which seems to have played an important role which cannot be left out of consideration--leading also to -the kindred and suggestive word and concept of 'spendere." The Greek root 'spendo" with its dominant sense of pledging oneself to an allegiance through the rites of a libation throws an interesting light on the nature of will and determination, as "pledging." There lies in this a groping in a direction inherent in the na- ture and capacity and range of integration of cause and pur- pose, an intelligible if not inevitable emergence in a balanced and disciplined spontaneity. The fundamental sense I imply in spontaneity is one of naturalness; no matter how attained, whether grown by inte- gration or by special creation and- miracle as assumed by some, it certainly is inherent in life and in personality function. The "sua sponte" points to an inclusion of voluntariness arid will, and I cannot help wondering about the hanging together of the roots and concepts inherent in the words play, pleasure, the German "pflegen" and "Pflicht," when I follow the root of "spouse" to our response and the inevitable concept of respon- sibility. There inheres in the nature of all our action combina- tions of chance, coincidence and creation by- growth and crea- tion by anticipation and purpose, by potency and will, by cause and by reason, and by knowledge, of the senses and finally also of sense--that sense which with the French expresses itself in the progression from mere connaitre to savoir--and the ken which goes closely with what one "can" and what the German includes in konnen. From "sua sponte" and its well of capaci- ty and ability we come naturally to responsibility, as we come from consciousness to conscience and from a passive material- ism to an active progressive creative spontaneity integrating both idealism and objectivity. I see in this progression of terms and concepts a fact-determined and not merely wish- determined realization of relations and potentialities and neces- sities of comprehensiveness. How can I, on the other hand, save this concept of spontaneity from any hasty charge of "vagueness" by those who fail to turn to the nature of the fact and want to limit the meaning of a word and concept, when we should sense also the direction, not only the limited but the open character of a time- binding process with its open definitions and specifications? In actual work with specific persons, there is a strong tendency to belittle what cannot be brought to a sampling and</page><page sequence="7">156 SOCIOMETRY bottling in a test tube with an experimental stab at perform- ance. Yet, thinking in terms of the extent of spontaneity inher ent in a person or human performance is perhaps more impor- tant than any show of superaccuracy in a field of so many rel- ativities and such a wealth of potential inclusiveness as is in- herent in the nature of man. Spontaneity comes closest to the verbal description of that actual functioning and resourceful- ness which the teacher and the social worker and the physician and the subject should look to and cultivate--and which we can accept as a reality, provided that in spontaneity, as in the con- cept of 'life," we eliminate mere magic. Spontaneity, responsiveness and initiative and not only imagination and sense or acquired unassimilated habit or chance, that is what we have to respect. We are not losing ourselves in metaphysics but include biological human reality, and with it a vision and idealism guided and chastened by ex- perience and a consciousness including conscience, and a spon- tineity with responsibility. Experimental psychology with its demands for mathe- matical accuracy has done much to make us neglect or under- rate what needs also other methods of demonstration, analysis and understanding and evaluation. One longs for direction of attention to what might revitalize the interests in man and bring them closer to what assures attention to the person and not largely some formulas favoring cut-and-dried or dogmatic conceptions of mechanization. A 'science of life" without full respect for life where it lives and as it lives is not true science. There is a real place for life only in a conception of the universe which does respect (i.e., consider again) its type of progress and march in time as well as in space. A view of reality that does not include and respect the multiplicity and interpenetration of re- lations in a way that holds for the individual, and also for the groups that have to pull together, is not broad and inclusive and dynamic enough for our task. A philosophy based only on the physics of the inanimate and trying to legislate a concep- tion of the whole without respect for biology and psychobiology where they operate, is not an adequate guide for man. (See H. S. Jennings, The Universe and Life. Yale Univ. Press, 1933). Whoever treats human life without respect for the in- clusiveness and creativeness of the individual and group (i.e., entities with f luatuating "fields" of implication) is not a safe leader nor a safe follower. There is no need of suspecting at once a claim of a detached "vital force," or an assumption of a tapping of ultra-biological reservoirs of knowledge. We</page><page sequence="8">SPONTANEITY 157 might rather speak of a vital and biographic organization and integration held up to us in an attitude guided by the question: "How are we to be and to , and to yield in time to the next generation?" Any fact inherent in the conception of life and of person must be alive and anything that makes claim to more than immediate significance must be sharable. Spontanei- ty is in line with the fact of a far-reaching privacy of implicit function and fancy consistent with the capacity for communica- ble function and teaming. The social fact of belonging and reci- procity is deeply rooted and related to the fact that man cannot even persist and perpetuate himself alone, and that there has to be a reasonably elastic but truly elastic linking together of groups and clearly sensed and clearly felt and clearly practiced common social principles, not merely sexual love or only pos- session and being possessed. It is naturally preferable to large numbers and groups of 'humans" to keep aloof from the complexities and to think in terms of statics, or to think of persons as lasting entities and of minds, where the more functionally trained speak of men- tation, allowing it to rise and subside geyser-fashion in a con- tinuity carried by the organism in an order and integration of function and of dynamics. The essential principle will tend to express itself in philosophies and religions and absolutistic or pragmatic special ways and yet with the more or less of a gen- eral common-sense core, in spite of the widely differing his- torical and contemporary garbs. There is bound to be much individual spontaneity, but also a growth of spontaneity that in- cludes a maturing common-sense, an appreciation of the best consensus and consideration. The most critical period of spon- taneity is no doubt that of adolescence, today in a turmoil be- cause the traditional relations of the young and the elder and the oldest and the youngest of the coexisting contemporary gen- erations are not easily grasped and adapted to mankind on an accelerated move. We must be able to sense stability in mo- tion. Even inertia is not a standstill but maintenance of the ex- isting pace; growth is not static physics and chemistry but the physics and chemistry working in lifetimes and in orderly suc- cessions. In life, there are laws of chance as much as laws of order. Passing from a philosophy of absolutism to one of relativities creates a specially difficult period. Yet relativity does not demand a sweeping negation of the absolute where one actually does deal with detachable realities, but it calls for re- spect for relations wherever and however they exist. Since the speed of average man ceased to be only 4 miles an hour, since roads and vehicles have made it possible to go from</page><page sequence="9">158 SOCIOMETRY start to destination more quickly and with fewer changes of loading than is provided by the present types of street cars and railroads, and since time and space have become a vital and not merely extraneous factor in the life of many, we have had to meet and shall have to meet new demands with new ca- pacities and comprehensions. When "the air" carries words and even pictures it becomes urgent to have a morality of "news" in words and pictures quite different from the days when questionable indulgences could be peddled among the few with limited danger of reaching those apt to be harmed. And it also becomes essential that we should teach not only eterni- ty but also the now and here, not under a logic of either-or, but of both-'and," with a "side by side" of young and old, and a capacity of leaders who also know and respect the led. In order to keep on safe and controllable ground, I like to emphasize the not particularly fashionable start from the ac- tual, immediate data ("donne'es immediates") in contrast to the reaching out for a something behind it all; I look for a middle ground between the too exclusively and naively mechanized real- ity of much of modern science (and also specifically of too im- mediate and obligatory a use of over standardized and over mechanized types of a hypothetical "unconscious"), and, on the other hand, the elasticity of the wish and uncontrolled and un- disciplined vision, intuition and revelation. I like to think of the tried and critically controlled realities and the principles of well-planned visions and projects and uses, and the concrete reports of the actual emergent attainment and performance (which seems to be the vital principle of what the Russian workers and planners call "dialectic materialism"; a vision obligatorily thought out and tried out, and progressing to the next vision to be tried out, the very antithesis to Nietzsche's eternal recurrence); not an eternal beginning at the first begin- ning (for there still are serious gaps between the successive sets of integration) but a recognition of one's being on the way, and unable ever to begin again quite at the same place, with any such smug contentment as that of the Boston lady who does not need to travel because she basks herself in the fact that she is 'already there." I am thinking--if I read it correctly, for it does not seem simply stated--of G. Mead's Philosophy of the Present or of "the ever-new" of growth and integration. Our flights of fancy come from off the earth, and they have to be brought to earth again in a practical thought of practice and of education ready to start with the ever-newly arranged mater- ial in hand, with all the sobriety of concrete experience, doing now and here at least what plain sense and a knowledge of his- tory tell us, with plenty of room for ventures; not mere venture,</page><page sequence="10">SPONTANEITY 159 but we might say earned and seasoned venture. We may summarize our preliminary general considera- tions as follows: Both science and the theory and practice of education and of social problems have occupied themselves very much with the rather theoretical problem of nature and nurture and the plasticity of the human being. I propose to suggest as of equal if not greater importance attention to the problem of spontaneity as the issue that deals directly with the use of the available capacities. It is spontaneity that concerns us vitally in practical life--that which we may expect as the person's own--with or without the help of others, and at any time, irrespective of conditions. A mere enumeration of isolated capacities does not bring that to us. We are interested in what man does 'sua sponte," as a natural rise "of his own nature'--be it in action or rest, effort or restraint, it is spontaneity as long as it is the individual's or group's own nature, as part of a course of behavior and performance in action or planning or in fancy, or contemplation of the doings of others, with action, rest, recu- peration and again action, with specific temperament, disposi- tion, inhibition or release. Respect for spontaneity and its cultivation (in harmony with what man learns from the "astronomy" of the universe and also from modern micro-physics, and from the chemical affini- ties, but biologically conditioned in us) is absolutely essential fpr actual life and especially for educator, social worker and physician. Spontaneity is not unscientific just because it may be too susceptible to misinterpretation by those biologically poorly trained. It is not just a concern of metaphysical Teason- ing and religious dogmatism, but the natural upshot of psycho- biological integration or behavior open to critical obligatory ob- servation and active planning in our work with human beings (including ourselves). It leads us far into social and political life, with the leaders and the led. It is that which we want to cultivate in its best disciplined and adjustable form. Spontaneity, if it is to constitute any smoothly running performance or adjustment, depends on a fitness and congruity of setting or environment which can never be anywhere near absolute. It requires proportion and plasticity and security of background and perspective of possibilities. It requires a cer- tain morale and stability and continuity, which today are very seriously shaken up through surrender of false props, often without corresponding readjustments in the guidance and natural conditioning of the growing person or the one facing life, and a sense of a respected career with a balance of stimulus and contentment. One is staggered by the ease with which</page><page sequence="11">160 SOCIOMETRY dictatorships can get a hold and the extent to which democracy is surrendered. This is explained only by the serious malori- entation under the pressure of ruthless propagation of patterns which are difficult to fit into the scheme of actual production and consumption and something like a code. One realizes the need of a simultaneous cultivation of culture, self-dependence and a balance of budget and its burdens, and of satisfactions from socialized life. The conditions affecting the balance of spontaneity and allegiance to the State and to law have to bring together the individual and the group in a reasonable and intel- ligible reciprocity of helpfulness. It should be obvious that adequate creative and planned attention should be given to the psychobiological needs and the balancing of the individual and group participants in the family, community, business and legal and political life. We need not only vocational advice but a morale and clearness of orientation and a place for the voca- tions; we need education of the individual and the groups, not merely as formal entities to be perpetuated but as time-bound personalities to live our span of life in our place in the pro- cession of generations. We need our contact with actuality, but also with the spontaneities laid down in the human atmos- phere. Somehow the history of language shows that there was and is a natural groping in a general direction more inclusive than is generally needed today. Does it not look as if even the root underlying the words pleasure and play (also back of pflegen, i.e., cultivate, and Pflicht or duty) and the word-com- plex including prayer had also sensed as 'precarious" too much dependence on prayer or begging for favor? And can we adequately appraise the spontaneities of art of music, of crea- tions in word and picture and drama and even the modest charade? All these possibilities reach into very complex rela- tions. We have to go seriously and actively into the business of learning to know, and to guide, and to provide for, our hum- man spontaneities. We cannot afford always to go back in re- ligion to Adam and Eve and the reiteration of their sad story, and to a seven-day creation by the Creator, or to a picture of absolute perfection which gives the appearance of insignificance to the actualities of real life. Nor can we afford in science to begin always with the atom of physics and chemistry or, to- day, with the electron and proton as the only concern of prog- ress, or with an astronomical cosmos, where our actual life is a differentiation and maturing of a biological order. We must be willing and able to rise to common-sense or a consensus of</page><page sequence="12">SPONTANEITY 161 today. We cannot leave out or just allow to drift the human capacities, attitudes and needs and achievements or blunderings as slaves of machine and of credit booms. That can easily get out of control. We cannot have blind and fitful experimenta- tion either in education or in government, in civics and in eco- nomics, in fits of despair of a real democracy or group order and dreams of revolutions. Rebellions when necessary; but de- struction? We may need reconsideration of the Constitution from time to time as demands occur, not as mere patchwork but in reply to a healthy and constructively spirited referendum; there is no need of revolution or sweeping landslides of hate and false enthusiasm born of mere remonstrance. We have to rise to new concepts of democracy recognizing that men are not all born equal but born to be fair and to be treated with fairness. We need a constitution that is not merely a bill of rights but a formulation of individual and civic code within which we can also see our obligations. We want laws for guid- ance so as to avoid compulsion and revulsions. There should be no legislation without an expose of the facts from which a demand for legislation and a goal can be accessible and clear to every citizen. We want a closer relation between civil rights and obligations and criminal law; we need a clearer knowledge of the range of consensus on property and trade and credit so that we may understand where reprehensible operations begin and must be avoided. We want legal interests to have construc- tive obligations and not largely an interest in ways of getting around the stipulations of consensus, politics with definition of obligation and pledge in contrast to the implication of feeding private interests on the res publica. It is ludicrous to be asked whether you actually have had a fire when you seek legal help to get a road to your house so as to be accessible to the fire- protection. It is humiliating to sense that politics, the occupa- tion with public interests, has come to denote largely the exploi- tation of public interests and machinery for private interests, with an apparent incapacity to agree on an organization accessi- ble and acceptable to the rank and file of adults and not a be- wildering spectacle to the adolescent. In the midst of resulting frustrations, Miss Schlotter's account of the Development of Recreation in a State School and Colony is a tremendously heartening and stimulating demonstration of the cultivation of the meaning of all that which we call spontaneity. It represents not mere wishing and dreaming and an adding together of casual items, but solid experience to be taught and fostered and ap- plied not only in an institution with its concentrated necessities. To maintain the achievement and to give it a normal setting,</page><page sequence="13">162 SOCIOMETRY the methods of education for the- rank and file must be kept free from jeopardy through injudicious blunder of public admin- istration. When economics are forced on us, the school budget is apt to be pounced upon. Yet the school system is the practical expression of the hope of an advancing civilization. We should pledge ourselves to go without luxurious and conspicuous waste before touching the none too well supported provisions for the young who have to accept also the consequences of adult social and political and economic blundering. Today we certainly have to look out for what is happen- ing when frequently untrained though well meaning boards of estimates and boards of education invade the basic understruc- ture of education for sound democracy to hand over its much needed funds to patch up the sins of mismanagement of credit and of taxation. Nothing of this kind should be tolerated until the members of these boards have themselves begun to suffer from pangs of uncertainties and even from pangs of hunger one or two days a week. There is obviously a demand for interre- lations which can be maintained only with sound foundations for spontaneity. When we want to maintain or rather to create a modern democracy, a democracy adapted to modern needs and demands and opportunities, we have to see that the chosen leaders work at least with what can be intelligible to the rank and file, who then can be expected to operate at least with the sense they were born with. Democracy and civilization do not just happen. They are products as well as states of order, and conditions that re- quire a progressive self-maintenance and self-development. In such growth, laws have to be principles of guidance and not only a privilege to enforce and to prohibit and to pun- ish. Every law must be an education and not only an arbitrary order. The sooner legislators begin to understand this, the smaller will be the number of laws and the greater their near- ness to human nature and needs and benefit. In Swiss legisla- tion every voter receives a statement of the basic data and dis- cussions, and there is a definite limitation of the number of proposals that can be submitted to the voters and thereby a self-regulating principle. Can we leave the promulgation of facts for civic organization and discussion of policies to a press that is supporting itself by the sale of advertisements? Can administration be at its best when it is drawn into the rivalry of competing parties as the spoils of the victor? With- out a basic stability even the best spontaneity is apt to</page><page sequence="14">SPONTANEITY 163 miscarry. The same holds for economics, where personal and civic budgeting is well-nigh impossible. Experimentation is a privilege. H. G. Wells speaks of the English as muddling through. What word can we use and what developments can we expect when whole social strata have the stock market as their main interest and center of their philosophy? And, instead of balanced thrift a credit system so useful within its limits, yet so apt to get out of hand, and, like the machine, apt to pass from being a tool into becoming a rul- er in insufficiently organized humanity? These become momentous history-making issues in the management of our spontaneities, which are our most distinc- tive human fate and nature. Man is a maker of tools and also a maker of history including himself. It is our historian Rob- inson that writes for us of 'Mind in the Making.' To under- stand and regulate himself, man must know himself as a ma- chine and also as a center of relative spontaneity, growth and action and imagination. The physicist is apt to show us and to force upon us either the clutches of non-humanized rule of chance and experimentation or then a divinity of astronomy too far from life. It has taken several generations to bring forth and train a small group of students of man working on the be- ginnings of a science of man and his conduct and functioning-- already, prematurely, making of themselves a new practicing profession. What we need is the humanization of science gen- erally and the influence of the regulating lawful procedure of science to digest man's human tendencies. We need balance; we need common-sense, a natural way of looking for what we can accept as common, in spite of all our individualism, and therefore respect for both individualism and social law and or- der. We need time for judgment and yet preparedness to act when the moment is at hand and decision is wanted. In the continual change and development of new conditions we need a balance of venture and consistency, and concentration and com- prehensiveness, a capacity to use history and imagination for foresight. We need a balanced resourcefulness, a balanced spontaneity, the cherished good of humanly integrated life. When the spontaneity of leaders fails, there come waves of undisci- plined spontaneity and the upshot yields the curves of dependa- bility of our civilizations. All this calls for a capacity in balancing education and medical work and economics and politics which is not every- body's capacity, but is sharable in spite of individual differ- ences. The universities bring together armies of people with</page><page sequence="15">164 SOCIOMETRY tremendous vigor but still without the experience to be derived from the lickings one gets out of mature life, especially in these days in which parents are too busy in the stock market and in costly and time-consuming competition in what Veblen called conspicuous waste, in a life running on, or eager for, wheels and aircraft, or eager for thrills of life as compensa- tion for their boredom with themselves and their contempora- ries. Shall we resign ourselves to an inability to be satisfied with a sound middle ground of steady and basic attainment and an attitude capable of accepting and cultivating reality as a mat- ter of more than forced patience and tolerance? The biologi- cal as well as sociological unit,the family, is apt to be ma- ligned and correspondingly mismanaged as a school for discon- tent and divorce, with hardly a word for its ever returning po- tentialities and the call for resuscitation in a period of change. There are no doubt inevitable contradictions in the scheme of life. In our hospitals we may be retarding the weed- ing out of the unfit and may create new cripples and what might even be called public burdens because we want to save those who are worth while. We accept this as a side product of really saving the many that need it and are needed. And we turn it to the good of human experience. Today, we arrest such diseases as paresis after the harm has gone far enough for a diagnosis. In two generations we could destroy the dis- ease if we could or would heed our knowledge, as foresight about sptrochaetes and their hosts and not as mere hindsight. In the meantime we do as well as we can and turn to the use of more experience that which is not wholly ideal. Perhaps al- cohol as a renewed problem will again give us cause for think- ing and acting creatively rather than for making a mere repu- tation in different kinds of crusading. Perhaps, a little more conscience, and keener sense of responsibility for health for oneself and for the group will do better than prohibition legis- lation. Perhaps the American Legion promises to be our army for peace rather than a school for exploitations and a "will to group power' destructive of state or democracy. Work and leisure, employment and unemployment, earn- ing and spending, credits and debts, they all have to be bal- anced and leaders are to be trained also to be led, at least by their own best judgment. They are products and problems of human spontaneity. Instead of expecting magic and revelation by magic, we are learning to use facts, the data and the lessons and experi- ments of success as well as failure; and it is here that this conference of social workers has valuable experience to enrich</page><page sequence="16">SPONTANEITY 165 our resources. The short-lived but widespread enthusiasm con- cerning technocracy showed how eagerly humanity is looking for help. If It can make itself intelligible and if the basic princi- ples are near enough to actual life, there is no danger of in- difference in these days of threat and fear of trouble. The live human being needs his balance of pleasure and seriousness, his play and work, his variety as well as order, his outlook as well as performed history whether old or in the making. He must have his joys in fancy, in contemplation and rest as well as in the satisfactions of achievement. He needs approval and evidence of security and not only the mere possibilities and promises of hope and charity. He needs his emotional ritual tradition of religions and popular customs as well as reasoned principles of intellectual and inventive progress. He needs balanced spontaneity. Free will? and will to power only? Tantrums and revolutions for the sake of attain- ment at all cost? Will is free when in reasonable harmony with sound tendencies and not making for destructive conflict. A reasonably moderate progress beginning "at home' before one wants to enforce or prohibit, and project one's hopes and one's rules on others, should go a long way to make for evolu- tion rather than revolution. The remarkable attainments in educational experiments promise to make unnecessary much unhappiness and unhappy ways of attempt at remedy. More and more remedy comes from the joy of health and less wallowing in display of patholo- gy and public thrills from exhibits of confession, and thrills from crime and misdemeanor. A great question naturally is that of the modifications of undesirable trends formed by human spontaneity. Forcible education with punishment has been so misused that the pendu- lum has swung in the direction of total non-interference. That is certainly as much an error as the Dalton and complete non- interference scheme in technical education. But the trend to- day Is one of wanting to work out the methods on ground of re- spect for spontaneity, instead of guidance merely by the mood of the trainer. Preventive management and correction of minor beginnings presuppose foreknowledge and a keen sense for order even in plasticity. We may learn to prevent in childhood the tantrums that play havoc in adolescence. What will our government do for those who labor for the improvement of resources and vision of providing also non- remunerative opportunities enriching actual life with new types of leisure? This one thing is certain. The support of the</page><page sequence="17">166 SOCIOMETRY system of education has to be kept out of the vacillations of budget and arbitrary disturbances of continuity of service. Sep- aration of ethical and religious-ritual training, as I have al- ready said, has perhaps been too radical and has left the inter- est in the vital spontaneity and attitude of the pupil, home and public too much out of consideration in the school, in the court, in the corrective agencies and in the physician's domain. More knowledge and more tact will have to make collaboration more acceptable. The conscience of today should not be adding pain to what cannot be changed but should make us forward- looking and constructive in matters of demeanor and in matters of health and of business. For this we need investigation and agencies that can bring the resources of better knowledge to those who need it. We cannot afford to indulge in extremes. Russia has gone boldly ahead. But she still has the secret police with its terror. She has "class" hatred as a dynamo. She has her hunger and restrictions of liberty mixed in with a new balance of freedom. She has a long history of hard struggles to rise from. We are in the habit of calling her a laboratory of ex- perimentation. She shows us new groupings at work; dearly paid for but active, tolerable only in a setting that would spell dire hardship to us. We, in turn, must remember that we are spoiled conquerors, still ruthlessly exploiting the spoils of a continent; we should not forget that our supposed freedom is marred by boss-and-racket ridden organizations which might seem terrible to unprejudiced or differently prejudiced onlook- ers. It would almost seem as if it took misery, a Chicago fire, or some other disaster, to give chances for progress and to make unnecessary the willful disasters of rebellion--or do we want to rise to and muster our spontaneity? Have your choice ! The remedies lie in a sense for balance which we are striving to attain. What we need is a mixture of stability and plasticity, possible where there is enough clearness and chance for under- standing and using one's understanding at home and at large, beginning at the self but also including the very real entity called the state. The state, we should remember, has to live with a sense for all that which is implied in vital spontaneity instead of serving as an ever-ready victim to be plundered, and has to maintain a government which also should not be tempted to bribe the individual by bonuses or party benefit from legislation.</page><page sequence="18">SPONTANEITY 167 Thinking and working with and for man is thinking and working with and for a set of relations and realities nearest to us. But we also need perspective. There is not a boon that cannot also become a poison. Religion means to be the great- est aid to happiness and yet it has bred the most cruel inquisi- tions and still entails endless retardation of general progress by the holding back of its own adjustments. Law has been used by tyranny and through its hopeless obstinacy has made some turn to anarchy. Education has to be balanced or it creates a hotbed of discontent and armies of discontented learned fools and parasites. Modern life demands sense for work and sense for leisure. With a growing sense for human spontaneity and its good and bad features, we need the philosophy of the now and here illuminated by history and by a cultivation of outlook and crea- tive fancy. Mead's "Philosophy of the Present' needs rewriting and further development for the many that should have it. We must learn to realize that life is history in the making and that it is the status nascendi that constitutes Mead's present, oper- ated under the guidance not of unattainable eternity, but of a vision of the passing and still active and coming generations at hand, and a use of historical time and the centuries within the reach of our knowledge and imagination. To sum up, spontaneity is a quality that we have reason to pay specific attention to in order to get out of the purely static habit of disregarding the active and forceful features of our subjects, the human individuals and groups. Scientific ob- jectivity does not imply disregard of human differences and es- pecially that difference which we call spontaneity, and among the spontaneities those that pull together play, pleasure and what one does sua sponte, as one's nature, response and re- sponsibility. In other words, we must treat man with and for that spontaneity that spells also responsibility as made up of ever recurrent and disciplined spontaneity.</page></plain_text>
