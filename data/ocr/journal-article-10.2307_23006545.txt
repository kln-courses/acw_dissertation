All archaeologists involved in the study of prehistoric and contact period peoples of Canada know that 'the broad brush' of James Wright's painting of the cultural land scape has been integral to the devel opment of Canadian archaeology, as pointed out by George MacDonald in his reminiscences in the Foreword to Painting the Past with a Broad Brush: Papers in Honour of James Valliere Wright. The incredible temporal, geographi cal, methodological and theoretical breadth of the 24 chapters in this volume is a tribute to Wright's over whelming contribution to Canadian archaeology. While the volume has been loosely organized according to geography, I would be inclined to divide these papers into five basic cat egories : 1. the contributions of specific individuals to Canadian archaeology; 2. archaeological data as a resource; 3. culture history; 4. useful methodo logical techniques or approaches; and 5. those papers dealing with theoretical arguments supported by archaeologi cal data of a particular region or site. Though James Wright would perhaps not have seen any boundaries between these arbitrary divisions, this organi zation facilitates the examination of the wide scope of the chapters in this volume. The life and work of James V. Wright is covered in the second to last chap ter in the book. Ian Dyck presents the edited transcripts of his interviews with James Wright, revealing that Wright's curiosity knew no bounds when it came to the early peoples of Canada and the progress of the discipline. In the final chapter of the book, Joyce M. Wright provides an excellent and detailed annotated bibliography of the published works of her father and the progression of his widespread meth odological and theoretical interests in Canadian archaeology. While James Wright had a profound influence on Canadian archaeology, two ethnogra phers from the early 20th century, Philip Drucker and Edward Sapir, discussed in Alan D. McMillan's chapter, influ enced interpretations of Northwest Coast archaeology of the Barkley Sound region on Vancouver Island. Several chapters of the volume pro vide excellent summaries of classes of archaeological data that will become very useful resources. William Fox adds to the work begun by James V.

The excellent photographs and descriptions of these cherts provide essential details regard ing knapping properties and the array of resulting artifacts. Carol Mason attempts to provide a chronological framework for contact period sites in central North America using design change in iconic Jesuit rings. The chap ter by Norman Clermont provides a short, useful summary and analysis of the archaeological information avail able on sunflower seeds in eastern Canada. Clermont provides a history of their use and questions why prehistoric peoples would expend so much energy to acquire and process them. While sunflower seeds appear to have been used in small quantities, C.T. Shay sug gests in his chapter that medicinal plant use among Aboriginal peoples in Mani toba was prolific despite a scarcity of archaeological data. Proceeding from an overview article by Pilon and Young, Janet Young re-evaluates the Archaic burials of the Morrison's Island 6 site in the Ottawa Valley. Pertinent informa tion and illustrations of each burial are provided. Through this re-evaluation, Young is able to provide numerous conclusions on the health, lifestyle and ritual life of these people. Local and regional culture histories are covered in a number of chapters honouring and building upon James Wright's contributions to culture his tory across Canada. In the only chapter in the book written in French, Marc Cote and Leila Inksetter re-examine ceramic evidence from Blackduck sites in northwestern Quebec. The authors suggest that the peoples of the Abitibi Temiscaming region were in fact Algonquian producers, not importers, as suggested by James Wright, of cul turally distinct Blackduck pottery. Also fascinating is Donald Clark's study of the taphonomy of the British Mountain Assemblage from the Engigstciak Site, Northern Yukon. Clark demonstrates using taphonomy that the British Moun tain Assemblage, previously thought to have been 20,000 years old, is actually only 3,000-4,000 years old. In the first chapter of the book, David Sanger re evaluates his previous study that linked the disappearance of swordfish and the people of the Late Archaic Moorehead phase, in the Gulf of Maine. Sanger con cludes that it was the replacement of the Moorehead phase Archaic people by the Susquehanna Tradition that caused the cessation of swordfishing in the Gulf, not the disappearance of the fish. In a somewhat different vein, Christian Gates St-Pierre's chapter is a review of recent archaeological work in southern Quebec. His analysis of the new archae ological evidence on the Archaic and Early Woodland periods of southern Quebec lead him to conclude that the prehistoric peoples of Quebec, Ontario and the Northeast U.S. were more closely associated than archaeologists previously thought. Charles A. Mar tijn's chapter presents ethnohistoric material concerning the contact period encounters of the Inuit and Europeans in northern Newfoundland, showing how little we actually know about the Historic Inuit occupation of the area. Instability brought about by European contact is also the focus of Frances Stewart's chapter on the Abenaki in Maine. Through detailed analysis and interpretation of almost 20,000 faunal remains, Stewart unravels the subsis tence strategies employed by Abenaki to deal with the increasing instability Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="3">PAINTING THE PAST WITH A BROAD BRUSH • I 77 brought about by this contact and the rising importance of maize agriculture in the prehistoric diet. The examina tion of cultural continuity and change is also the focus of Jean-Luc Pilon and Janet Young's presentation of burial data in the Ottawa Valley. They trace a gradual change in burial patterns over a 6,000 year period. According to Pilon and Young, the complex and somewhat 'erratic' patterns are a reflection of con tinuing changes in the attitude to death and the afterlife brought into this com munications corridor throughout these millennia. Like the previous chapters, Claude Chapdelaine explores cultural continuity. Chapdelaine produces the first regional cultural sequence for the Megantic Lake Area, southeastern Quebec and suggests that cultural con tinuity from Paleo-Indian to historic Aboriginal groups cannot be defini tively proven. Lastly, Knut Fladmark provides an overview of the archaeo logical cultures of subarctic B.C. His 'provisional' culture-historic framework compares the cultural trajectories of two river watershed groups, one occu pying a productive salmon producing drainage area and the second from a non-salmon riverine environment. hundreds of years of reoccupation at an Arctic hunting camp site. Ethno graphic analogy guides the assignment of specific artifact categories to activi ties. Gordon suggests this methodology could be useful for the exploration of all living floors. Raymond J. LeBlanc calls for more widespread use of eth nographic analogy and experimental archaeology to aid in the interpretation of what Wright called 'the sparse site syndrome' found throughout the Cana dian subarctic. Through the application of analogy from hunter gatherers, LeB lanc explains that small lithic scatters of expedient scrapers and flakes are rem nants of a larger assemblage of unpre served organic tools. In an effort to prove the utility of the Direct Historical Approach, J. Rod Vickers and Trevor R. Peck show a continuity of use of ritual objects over the last 1,000 years among the Nitsitapii or Blackfoot of the Plains . Several chapters in the volume dis cuss archaeological methodologies. Wil liam D. Finlayson, Don McQuay, Bernie Neery and Ian Williams' chapter is the most methodological and describes the use of GIS and GPS technology in the Pickering Airport surveys in southern Ontario. While GIS/GPS technologies are not new, the authors point out the usefulness of integrating them more thoroughly into basic research and anal ysis of all archaeological sites. Bryan C. Gordon's analysis presents a method ology for untangling the massive web of lithics produced by a palimpsest of Two chapters illustrate how theo retical approaches to the interpreta tion of material culture can help us to understand the people behind the artifacts. By employing the 'dwelling' concept (Ingold 1993, World Archaeology 25(2): 152-174), ethnographic analogy, and experimental archaeology, Christo pher Ellis provides an insightful study of the Paleo-Indian Crowfield and Caradoc Sites, in Ontario. Viewing these amazing lithic caches from an anthropomorphic perspective, Ellis suggests that ritual caches were meant to imbue the land scape with cultural meaning during the colonization of uninhabited lands. In another chapter, Peter Ramsden exam ines small-scale spatial patterning of material culture and house development and interprets the 'history' of two power ful households at the Benson site, a 16th century Wendat village site in southern Ontario. He uses the theory of agency to Journal Canadien d Archeologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="4">178 • DEMARKAR In summary, this festschrift is a won derful tribute to James V. Wright, and an important contribution to Canadian archaeology. While I would suggest this volume should be an essential possession of every Canadian archaeologist, I do have a couple of small criticisms. First of all, an introduction should have been written by the editors explaining how the volume was created and why certain authors were selected as contributors. Secondly, the book would benefit from better binding—the book is poorly demonstrate that small-scale decisions and actions at the household and village level can have an influence on large scale historical events. bound for its size and quickly falls apart. However, these relatively trivial deficien cies are overshadowed by the high qual ity of the archaeological work between the covers. This overview of Canadian archaeology provides a well-rounded background to the scope of both the pre-contact cultures and archaeological research in the country helping the aca demic reader to discern where their own research and the research of the authors fit into the greater mesh of North Ameri can archaeology.
