<plain_text><page sequence="1">1994 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS 213 Reflections on the goddess Tayet* A review of the monumental and textual evidence for the little-known Tayet, goddess of spinning and weaving. TAYET is known as a goddess of weaving and spinning cloth. The present account offers some reflections on her place of origin, her form, her occurrence in texts and scenes, her function, and her relations with other deities in the Egyptian pantheon.1 Neither the process of weaving nor other deities of weaving who have no connection with Tayet will be dealt with in this study. Her place of origin is very uncertain. We have two starting points for speculation: the first is derived from the name itself, T;it(t). This is considered to be the name of a weaving town in Lower Egypt,2 and is also later the name of the town of Buto.3 Thus it is possible to deduce that Buto (Dep) was the place of origin for Tayet, who personifies the royalty of the northern kingdom.4 This deduction is based on the appearance of the sign n5 in the names of both the town and the goddess, and also in the Hymns to Diadems, which localize Tayet in Lower Egypt.6 Moreover, the texts situate the eye of Horus in the weaving town of Buto, and by so doing make a connection between the eye of Horus and Tayet.7 The second point of speculation is based on the statement in the temple of Dendara that Tayet was born in Dendara8 with a green or, more likely, a turquoise skin colour.9 Even in this refer- ence, however, her connection to Lower Egypt is maintained, since it appears in the Pr-nw shrine of the temple, which is the name of a shrine at Buto. Thus, the Dendara text strengthens the Buto connection at the expense of Dendara.10 As for her complexion, it is worth noting that Tayet had no iconographic form before the first millennium. Thus, she is only mentioned in inscriptions rather than represented in scenes. The primary inscriptions which mention her are the essential funerary texts of the Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead.11 The earliest representation of Tayet known thus far is in the chapel of Osiris hq;-dt at Karnak. A scene in the east inner room depicts Tayet in female human form holding two pieces of cloth and standing among a host of Nile gods with water, flowers and *I am grateful to the Griffith Institute, whose Gardiner Travel Scholarship enabled me to complete this paper which I commenced in Egypt.

They face Osiris and Isis, with the cartouche of the later Libyan king Rudamun in front of Osiris.12 This representation in human form is striking in two basic respects. First, Tayet is one of the rare deities in the Egyptian pantheon who have purely anthropomorphic forms (e.g. Ptah, Min).13 Secondly, although she is related to one of the oldest capitals in Lower Egypt, Buto, and is frequently alluded to in the religious books, yet her physical form was first depicted only in the first millennium and then more widely in the Graeco-Roman temples; many representations of Tayet with her cloth-sign occur at Dendara, Edfu, and Kom Ombo. In Dendara she appears many times. The first instance is in the side room X, 'The Chamber of Cloth', to the east of the inner vestibule,14 in a row which includes four standing figures, the king, Shesemu, Tayet and Ihy, before three seated ones, Hathor, Harsomtus and Ihy (fig. I).15 The text describes Tayet as a mother of gods.16 The second instance is in the same room, among seven seated figures of deities preceded by young Ihy. It is worth noting that here Tayet is holding the rnh-sign and the lotus sceptre rather than her traditional cloth-sign; the text relates her to Isis.17 The third representation is in the outer doorway of 'The Chapel of the New Year Court', where Tayet with Ihy offers a mrr-garment to Hathor and Horus.18 The text links her with the goddess Shayit of Dendara. Tayet's appearance here is probably significant in terms of the funerary rebirth associations of the end of one year and the beginning of a new one. Her fourth appearance in Dendara is in the interior of the same court.19 Here, Tayet with the king, preceded by a small figure of Harsiesi, offers cloth to Isis and Harsomtus.20 In the temple of Edfu, Tayet makes two appearances. The first is in the 'Chamber of Cloth', on the inner lintel of the entrance from the corridor of the vestibule of the treasury.21 She is seated in ?1, 26 20 19 18 17 16 I 10 9 7 6 2 32 33 34 35 36 57 38 39 4 41 42 43 461 FIG. .

She holds the cnh-sign and the lotus sceptre. The second representation is in room X adjoining the sanctuary of the temple,22 where Tayet, among a host of deities, is seated holding this time the w;st-sceptre and rnh-sign. Finally, in Kom Ombo she also appears twice: once among a host of divinities in the court of the temple,23 and again in the corridor of the inner vestibule of the Birth House, accompanied by the beer-goddess Menket.24 She is carrying the word for 'linen' (sir) as an offering in what is for her a unique representation. Tayet's function should also be considered in the light of her relationship to other deities. This grew out of her prominent funerary function, which was to cover the deceased with her handmade bandages, also called ttyt. t,25 in the embalming ritual. The whole process of weaving as well as covering the dead was thought to function under her patronage. Thus, she became a goddess of funerary tasks, not only because she covered the body of the deceased and protected him against decomposition, but also because she carried him to heaven as a drt (the kite bird) in order to join the company of Re in the horizon.26 This function recurs repeatedly in religious texts from various periods,27 as well as in references such as that in the story of Sinuhe, who was guaranteed 'wrappings (made) by the hands of Tayet'.28 In the tomb of Rekhmire, it is stated that 'the bandages are in the hands of Tayet'.29 In the funerary papyrus of Nesmin, a spell cites Tayet who will provide him [the Osiris Nesmin] with a cloth from her hands'.30 These functions of fashioning of bandages and providing transport to heaven link Tayet to the goddess Isis in several ways, firstly as a drt and goddess of the dead. Both had the ability to change the location of the dead to the desired state amongst the gods by the effect of being the drt-bird. 1 Secondly, like Isis who looks after her son Horus, Tayet is considered as a mother of the dead because she covers him with her wrappings.32 Therefore, it is understandable that a connection between the two as Isis-Tayet (;st-T;it) was formed in the New Kingdom.33 This identification with Isis led to Tayet's further connection with Nephthys, who with Isis forms the paired goddesses of the dead, the drty.34 Tayet's connection with Horus is evident both in her analogy to Isis described above and in the religious context where the cloth made by Tayet is referred to as 'the woven eye of Horus' or 'clothing the dead (king) in the eye of Horus (i.e. wrappings)'.35 22 PM VI, I48-9; Rochemonteix and Chassinat, Edfou I, 127, pl. xxi.b. 23 PM vi, I82 (18-23). 24 PM VI, 199 (25-6); cf.

Thus we find one of Osiris' names is Tity,36 and the dead person who usually becomes Osiris is also Tayet.37 Moreover, this funerary function relates Tayet to the god of ointment, Shesmu, who supervises the anointing of the body during embalming, and also to Imentet, the goddess of the West.38 We can also say that by providing clothing for the king, Tayet may be considered as a protector of the monarch.3 In this way, she is associated with the uraeus goddess Wadjet, who is well known as a protecting diadem of the king. Therefore, the uraeus receives in her hymns the name of Tayet,40 who, in her turn, has the cobra sign in the different writings of her name,41 and the word wfd(t) itself is present in many elements attributed to her (e.g. green colour or green linen).42 Moreover, this is perhaps the reason for Tayet's epithet 'mistress of fear', as a likely allusion to her protective function.43 The connection with Isis, who made garments for a number of goddesses, and with her symbolic motherhood of the king, as well as the fashioning for the gods and their statues of ceremonial wrappings known as 'the great adornments',44 enabled Tayet to claim the title 'mother of the gods and mistress of goddesses', particularly in the Graeco-Roman Period,45 when her position became more evolved and multi-functional. As regards Tayet's relationship with other deities, we should give particular attention to three of them: Neith, Hathor and Hedjhotep. Neith had a long-term connection with Tayet in weaving, and Sais itself was known as a 'mansion of weaving'.46 Moreover, many prayers were addressed to Neith by the dead to guarantee the wrapping of his body in bandages made by Neith, as by Tayet herself, in Sais.47 This connection is further established by Neith's attachment to the two sisters, Isis and Nephthys, and, with Tayet, to the Horus-eye, particularly during the Graeco-Roman Period.48 In addition, the identification of Tayet as the king's mother is also applied to Neith who 'carried the King of Upper and Lower Egypt in her womb ... (and) who is nourished by Isis, nursed by Nephthys, (and) nourished by the milk of Tayet'.49 Tayet's connection to Hathor adds some further aspects to her funerary function, as one of Hathor's responsibilities towards the deceased is to offer him bread, an item which only began to be added to the offering lists during the New Kingdom.50 Tayet, in her turn, had been connected with Nepri, the god of bread and corn, from the Middle Kingdom; on a stela of the Eleventh Dynasty, the owner states 'I gave bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked. I was son of 36 Wb. v, 231,1 I, citing BD 142 (variant Cc, 1. 74); the form is also used by P. Barguet, Le livre des morts (Paris, I967), I 07; contrast T. G.

In the Book of the Dead, the deceased expects bread from Hathor and linen garments from the hand of Tayet,52 and is assumed to eat bread 'on a small rectangular cloth which Tayet herself has woven'.53 This offering of bread perpetuates their connection into the Graeco-Roman Period, when Hathor was given the name of Tayet.54 The association with Hedjhotep has another dimension. From his first appearance in the Middle Kingdom, he is connected both to Tayet and to the eye of Horus, who are together responsible for the bandages offered to the deceased in the name of Hedjhotep, considered to be the masculine homologue of Tayet.55 Consequently, he was widely regarded as Tayet's consort in Edfu and Dendara during the Graeco-Roman Period.56 One may assume that this situation brought Tayet further familial relationships. Thus, Re became her father and Nut her mother,57 and the king was engendered as a son by Tayet herself.58 Finally, one may deduce that, in the beginning, the word Tit.(t) referred interchangeably to either the goddess or the cloth, without any further distinction. Also, it is conceivable that Tayet as a goddess was not considered an imageable deity until the first millennium, when she made her first appearance in scenes. At that time her embodiment in anthropomorphic form reflected human normality, which found ready acceptance among the worshippers. Moreover, one may assume that her widespread appearance in the Graeco-Roman Period was based on many factors, such as her early connection with kingship, either direct or symbolic, and also her assimilation to Horus and Isis in this particular sphere. Her function played a very important role in assuring her continued popularity after the Pharaonic period, since the use of bandages for embalming persisted. Subsequently, she adopted other funerary roles, such as providing the bread offering and milk. This position was strengthened by her connection with most of the prominent deities in the Egyptian pantheon, whom she provided with ornamental garments. In these ways, it is clear that Tayet's relationship to the other gods evolved in a manner beyond her funerary functions. Finally, by the Graeco-Roman Period, Tayet's greater prominence appears to have led also to the creation for her of family relationships among the gods.
