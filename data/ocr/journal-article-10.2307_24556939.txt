Typically exhibited together, they evoke a wide range of twentieth-century touchstones. For instance, the sculptures—arrangements of flat, intersecting planes of painted wood or aluminum— suggest the influence of Alexander Calder or David Smith, while the works on paper include both brushy, expressionistic abstractions reminiscent of early Pollock and brusque collages of found imagery inflect ed with surrealism.

Curry's work advances a seems to sum up this complex relationship, if not the notion of the self that is inevitably fragmented but gist of Curry's overarching project. The piece's three somehow manages to remain whole, components—a small collage, a drawing, and a resin coated shard of painted cardboard leaning against the wall—form a col loquy on the modernist figure. In the collage, an upside-down cartoon of an anthropomorphic tree mimics (and partially covers) a black-and-white photograph of a figurative, tribal sculpture. The image short-circuits the traditional separation between the reductive language of cartoons and the roots of modern abstraction. As a counterpoint, the adjacent drawing— a catalog of expressive brushstrokes organized into a rough oval—could be a face (or not). Its contours are extended into three-dimensional space by the curved edge of the card board fragment on the floor nearby. Primitivism and pop culture, abstrac tion and figuration, flatness and depth all rub up against one another in a rich, allusive brew. Curry situates the human figure amid this tangle, accounting for the many ways in which it has been dis sected and remade in the modern era. In doing so, he reveals our persistent to see our- .
