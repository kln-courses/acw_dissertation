<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert K. Straus* "MY IMP WAS NOT THE TERRITORY" "P ARLY last year I was asked by a friend whether I would like -*-1 to tell the story of how I became acquainted with general semantics. This was quite a challenge. I wondered what I could put down on paper. While I have no idea how anyone else would answer the question, I would guess that a necessary prelude would have to include some event that changed that person's outlook on the world. Alfred Korzybski (a name that will occur fre- quently in this memoir) would call it one's "personal episte- mology." "Not every individual knows or realizes the importance of, or seemingly consciously cares for, epistemol- ogy; yet eveiy one unconsciously has one and acts and lives it." (Science and Sanity, p.554) * Robert K. Straus has had distinguished careers in the worlds of commerce and public service. He served as a member of the New York City Council, founded Omnibook Magazine, was one of the founders of American Heritage Magazine, and was publisher of the San Fernando Valley Sun. A former President of the Institute of General Semantics, he received the 1991 J. Talbot Winchell Award, sponsored by IGS. 26</page><page sequence="2">"My Map was not the Territory" 27 I am quite sure that I inherited my epistemology from growing up as the youngest child of a privileged and ambi- tious family. This fact unconsciously made me compete with my sister and brother in meeting the family's accepted crite- ria of "success." Without realizing it, I started to question these criteria, but kept the questions repressed in my uncon- scious. In the language of general semantics, I had started to change my abstractions from those that governed the domi- nant epistemology of my family. This frightened me. Now I think of these unconscious abstractions as the architecture of my personal epistemology. My encounters, first with Freud and then with Korzybski, helped me to uncover these unconscious assumptions and get to know them, a process psychotherapists would call "self-understanding." Maslow considered that effort to be part of "self-actualization," and Korzybski thought it part of the "extensionalization" process. I majored in history at Harvard College, graduating in 1927. The Harvard history department in the 1920s was dominated by the German approach to history - if you knew the facts, you knew THE TRUTH! Neither the teacher's nor the student's perspective mattered. At least, that is my evaluation many years later. After college, I spent three summers at the Zimmern School of International Relations in Geneva, Switzerland. The program lasted two months and was influenced by its proximity to the League of Nations. The school was headed by Sir Alfred Zimmern, an Englishman who had drafted the Covenant of the League of Nations and later became Profes- sor of International Relations at Oxford. The students came from many countries, though French, American, and English students predominated. Zimmern opened the session with the statement: "If you have come to Geneva to study current events, you had better leave. If you stay, you are going to study the reactions of students from different backgrounds to the same events."</page><page sequence="3">28 Et cetera • Spring 1997 For me, this was a revolutionary idea. It gradually dawned on me that in the study of history there was no such concept as THE TRUTH. Not only did the revealed facts change over time, but the way in which they were viewed depended on who was doing the viewing and when he or she was doing it. Years later I think of histoiy as a form of literature some- where between non-fiction and fiction. The things that hap- pen constitute Korzybski's "territory." What we perceive, varies between who is doing the perceiving and when it is taking place. At the time, of course, I was ignorant of the dis- tinction between the verbal and the silent levels, or how the structure of our language causes identification of the two lev- els. Nor had I become familiar with the extensional device of dating "truths" to remind us of their temporary nature. This experience in Geneva prepared me for general seman- tics, which changed the notion of "perceiving" to "abstract- ing" and added an invaluable tool - the structural differential - to help bring the perspective that I had once repressed now into consciousness and, to learn to compare it with that of other individuals, especially those from different cultural and epistemological backgrounds. I could go on and see how differently each of us evaluates the perspective that we have abstracted! In 1935 I had a so-called nervous breakdown after being fired from my government job in Washington. I consulted a Freudian psychoanalyst, a standard procedure at the time. His name was Dr. Philip S. Graven and he is mentioned in Korzybski's preface to the first edition of his magnum opus as having invented the word "unsane" to describe a perspective somewhere between "sanity" and "insanity." His Freudian approach via the couch, dreams, etc., did veiy little for me, though I guess he introduced me to my un- conscious and tightly repressed thoughts for the first time. He suggested that I buy a copy of Science and Sanity, first pub- lished in 1933. When I look back at this incident after the many years that have elapsed, I realize how "unsane" was my reaction to be-</page><page sequence="4">"My Map was not the T erritory " 29 ing fired. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was one of the most important New Deal organizations of the early years of FDR's first term. It was headed by General Hugh S. Johnson, a West Pointer and cavalry officer, similar to in temperament and a close friend of General Patton with whom he shared a tent in the Mexican expedition that Gen- eral Pershing commanded in 1916. 1 was his first employee and his personal assistant from the beginning of the depart- ment in June 1933. 1 had gotten to know him during the sum- mer of 1932 when I was working with FDR's speech writers, later called members of the "Brain Trust." So I was excited to have such a job in a new and promising New Deal program. One day, probably a month or so after we got organized, he asked me to find him a secretary. I thought of Frances Robinson who had worked with members of the Brain Trust and with him and he said, "See if you can get her." She jumped at the chance and he took a great shine to her. Within a week or so she got him to fire me so that she had him to herself. Later on, his wife had to be committed to a sanitarium, due to her activities. And when he died, he left a good part of his estate to "Robbie," provided she was not married. But she was married, but according to the General's son Pat, she managed to get the money anyhow. During that first summer, Pat, also a West Pointer and, like his father, a lawyer, became one of my best and lifelong friends. Eventually, I saw that my "nervous breakdown" was due to abstracting only the fact of being fired and associating it with an acute sense of failure. After becoming familiar with the notion of "consciousness of abstracting," it was quite easy to understand that I had been very naive in not extensional- izing the fact that I had hired a veiy clever and ambitious woman who stopped at nothing to get her way. Ultimately, the Supreme Court declared the NRA was unconstitutional and that was the end of the program. In 1941 1 met a charming lady named Helen Rosen and we started talking about general semantics. A result of this meet- ing was that she invited Irving Lee to come to New York City</page><page sequence="5">30 Et cetera • Spring 1997 and give a seminar to a few of her friends: Helen's husband, Dr. Sam Rosen, attended, as did Miss Parkhurst, the founder and headmistress of the Dalton School (she allowed us to use one of her classrooms). The actor Frederick March and his wife, myself and several others also attended. Sam Rosen was an M.D. who specialized in hearing prob- lems. He became world famous after he discovered the sta- pes operation in 1953. He gave general semantics some credit for helping him make this discovery and when I traveled with the Rosens to China in 1978, Sam was cariying an Irving Lee book. He said he always had it with him. Lee was a born teacher and his premature death in 1955 at the age of 46 deprived general semantics of one of its first and best teachers. I had met Stuart Chase whose The Tyranny of Words was the first book to present general semantics to a large audience. Then Hayakawa's Language in Action became a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1940 and now, 57 years later, is in its 5th edition, edited by Hayakawa's son Alan. But it was Science and Sanity that had grabbed me initially and has stayed with me ever since. During four years in the Army in World War II, I carried that thick book in my bed- ding roll, while serving in England, France, Denmark, and Germany. Slowly, thanks in particular to the employment of the structural differential device, its ideas seeped into my consciousness and have remained there, wrapped around two of its key expressions: "The map is not the territory" and "consciousness of abstracting." Korzybski and Bois Seminars Out of the Army in March 1946, I had an immediate chance to hear Korzybski himself give a seminar in New York City. His presentation did not engage me as I had hoped. To me, he seemed too authoritarian. But what he had to say helped, and eight years later I spent two weeks at a</page><page sequence="6">"My Map was not the Territory" 31 Samuel Bois seminar at the Institute of General Semantics headquarters, then located in Lime Rock, Connecticut. Sam Bois' interpretation of general semantics appealed to me. It did not appeal to my roommate, Ben Harrison, then President of the New York Society of General Semantics. Harrison thought Bois was too "mystical," perhaps because of his background as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church. This did not bother me and I got to know Bois a in a more personal way. He came to our apartment for dinner in Man- hattan and told my wife and myself the stoiy of how he was "separated" from the Church as "unsuitable" for the job of priest, an action which I compared at the time with an "hon- orable discharge" from the Army. I attended another seminar at Bard College featuring Abra- ham Maslow, but I do not recall the year. I became a member of the Institute of General Semantics and, in time, an officer of the organization. As an officer, I got mixed up in its inter- nal politics and was not too happy about what I saw as the failure of all of us, myself included, to apply general seman- tics principles to management of our own organization. Though I never got to know Maslow well, his description of a "self-actualized" person seemed to me to parallel Kor- zybski's "extensionalized person." Perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that if one manages through "conscious- ness of abstracting" to get deeper and closer to "the keel," of one's consciousness (with the aid of the structural differen- tial), the result, one hopes, is that you begin to become self- actualized or extensionalized. And also, I hope, though one never reaches "the keel," one does get "deeper" as one gets older. At least, that has been my experience. Others have rec- ognized a relation between Maslow's ideas and general se- mantics. Indeed, he delivered the Korzybski Memorial Address in 1957. "Keel," by the way, is the word used by Katherine Merseth, Director of the Harvard Project in Schooling and Children to describe the depths of our consciousness, an apt nautical analogy, I think.</page><page sequence="7">32 Et cetera • Spring 1997 The Harvard Business School In 1965 my family wanted to do something to memorialize my father at the Harvard Business School. He had been inti- mately involved with the funding and development of the Business School as an Overseer who chaired the Business School Visiting Committee. Harvard's Board of Overseers is elected by its alumni to help bring intellectual and financial support to the management of the University and its facul- ties. After the first World War, the Business School had created the "Fatigue Laboratory" to study the psychological problems of employees. This study had interested my father, the CEO of Macy's Department Store, and he was, I think, one of the first executives to employ a psychiatrist in his personnel de- partment. His friend, Walter Gifford, was the CEO of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. And later Irving Lee was hired by AT&amp;T as a consultant. Korzybski had given a seminar at Harvard in 1937 and had won the support of some faculty members of the Business School and, of course, stirred the opposition of others. Profes- sor George Lombard was one of those who was interested and Fritz Roethlisberger was another. The latter had directed the famous Hawthorne study of relay workers in the General Electric plant in Milwaukee and later headed the Harvard Business School's Human Relations courses now lumped un- der Organizational Behavior. For some years George Lom- bard was Fritz's Deputy Director. George Lombard delivered the Korzybski Memorial Address in 1986. From this history arose the idea that an appropriate way for my family to honor our father's interest in the develop- ment of the Business School would be to endow a Chair dedicated to applying general semantics principles to study- ing the process of decision-making. The Business School ac- cepted the idea and my brother Jack and I drafted a letter to Dean Fouraker describing the purpose of the Chair. A copy of that letter is appended to the end of this article.</page><page sequence="8">"My Map was not the T erritory " 33 With the letter, I added an appendix, a selection of articles to back up the letter's position. The first of these articles was Korzybski's last article, which Charlotte Read, one of his three original assistants in his early days in Chicago, com- pleted after his death. Its title is "The Role of Language in the Perceptual Processes." The paper was presented posthu- mously at a conference on perception held at the University of Texas in 1951. Charlotte Read regards this article as the best short summary of Korzybski's outlook. After the creation of the endowment in April 1973, 1 had hoped that Professor Anthony Athos would accept the Chair. He was a member of the faculty and had been very enthusi- astic. He had written an article for the Harvard Business Re- view about general semantics. Athos had made a name for himself while on the faculty of the University of Southern California, appearing on the cover of Time magazine as one of the best teachers in the country. But no such luck. For personal reasons, he declined. Then three or four other faculty members were selected after 1973 but only one of them followed the approach to the process of decision-making that our letter to the Dean had specified in the agreement to create the chair. Various excuses have been made for 23 years, all revolving around the objection of fac- ulty members to the necessary interdisciplinary approach. In 1994, Harvard Business School revised its curriculum. The new curriculum is now entitled "Learning and Leader- ship." This new approach appears to me to be more inter- disciplinary but it will take time to see whether this over- comes the faculty's traditional resistance to it. A new Dean of the Faculty named Kim Clark has been appointed. A member of the faculty for many years, he is said to have been very involved in the design of the new curriculum and reported to be interested in interdisciplinary education. And he has just asked a senior and retired member of the faculty to review the situation regarding use that has been made of the funds donated by our family.</page><page sequence="9">34 Et cetera • Spring 1997 The Interdisciplinary Nature of General Semantics General semantics is by necessity interdisciplinary since it demands the recognition of the limitations of anyone's ab- stractions and the resulting perspectives. It also advocates the thoughtful consideration of the perspectives of other people and the abstractions that underlie them. Since any resulting decision depends on what each individual abstracted, it seems obvious that we should not take anyone's opinion too seriously, especially one's own! It should not be too difficult for anyone who understands the interdisciplinary aspects of this approach to decision-making to keep the ego from get- ting attached to one's opinions. Our own map will change over time, as will the maps of others. If one understands that one's opinions are the result of what one has perceived and abstracted from "what is going on," it is easy to see that any other individual will inevitably perceive and abstract something else. So any committee that has to make a decision should benefit from the perceptions and abstractions of its members. That is why the decisions of committees could potentially be more valuable than the deci- sions of any individual member, even if the individual is said to be an "expert"! Experts, necessarily, are specialists; but managers, necessarily, are generalists who must have the ability to sort out the various perspectives of committee members and judge when a consensus has been reached and call for the vote that turns the consensus into a decision. The structural differential provides a wonderful tool to re- mind one of how differently each of us abstracts from any aspect of reality and makes a personal map of whatever is being considered. The limitations of anyone's perceptions or abstractions are clearly indicated. Members of a committee faced with an important decision need to approach the meeting conscious that what they have abstracted has resulted in their personal perspective. They must be prepared to join in a free-wheeling discussion re- garding the various perspectives that the other members</page><page sequence="10">"My Map was not the Territory" 35 have brought to the meeting. And I emphasize "perspec- tives" in the plural since the committee's job is to cooperate in reaching a consensus that becomes the decision. Bob Lovett was once asked how one learned to make good judgments. He answered: "By making bad judgments." That was a good and amusing answer to the question. The case system, which the Harvard Business School borrowed from Harvard Law School, attempts to teach from actual experi- ence, just what Mr. Lovett was describing. The Harvard Busi- ness School spends millions to keep the cases up to date. Business Schools around the world use them in their teach- ing programs. One of the great difficulties, of course, is that to get these ideas into your head through verbal communication is one thing. But will they stay there and help one out of one's next dilemma? I think your choice among the various perspec- tives that can be abstracted has to get in your "guts" with suf- ficient force to stay there and be available for the next dilemma. And that only experience that involves what we usually call "emotion" will put them there - just having them in your head (what we call intellectual) - is not enough. Korzybski would say that the organism-as-a-whole must be involved - a more elegant way of describing "in your guts." Why does the general semantics approach to decision- making call for an interdisciplinary attitude? Because it tries to teach an individual to recognize what Rachel Lauer calls the four fundamentals, P.E.D.A. : • P: We Perceive and Abstract; • E: We Evaluate. • D: We Decide. • A: We Act. P, E, D, and A vary with every individual, as stated above. When a committee must make a decision, the differences in the individual perspectives that must be resolved in order to reach a consensus require an interdisciplinary approach. If</page><page sequence="11">36 Et cetera • Spring 1997 anybody insists on the over-riding accuracy of their personal perspective we could have a deadlock. If one's perspective is loaded down by one's ego the required compromise will be hard to reach, even impossible. Each member of the commit- tee must be ready to recognize that the best decision is only reached when the individuals involved realize that each of them has something to contribute or they would not be on the committee. This, of course, is an idealized comment. Problems arise immediately if committee members have some sort of vested interest in a decision. David Straus, a first cousin once removed, calls himself a "facilitato/' and has built a successful business called Interac- tion Associates which helps all types of committees reach de- cisions. He does not claim to know anything about the material that enters into the decision - just the technique of helping the individuals to collaborate in reaching a decision instead of fighting to have their perspective dominate the perspectives of other members of the committee. I am told that there are many other facilitators in the country taking a similar approach. As far as I can make out, Harvard Business School's diffi- culties with encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to decision making is not unusual. David Straus's interest in de- cision making seems to have been influenced by his having first studied architecture and finding that it got bogged down on questions of taste. I myself served on our local museum's Board of Trustees for ten years and never heard anyone ad- mit, myself included, that they did not have impeccable taste! Then one goes back over the history of art and reads how the Impressionists had to struggle for years to get ac- cepted. They were calling for a radical change in what and how artists were painting when they abstracted from what was out there. Note also the struggle of abstract artists in this centuiy to be accepted. My daughter, Penelope More, a stu- dent of art history, says that Cezanne was the Korzybski of the art world, adding many new perspectives to the tradi-</page><page sequence="12">"My Map was not the T erritory " 37 tional idea of perspective that first originated in the 16th cen- tury. I have been told that when President Bok, after 20 years, submitted his resignation to the Harvard Corporation, the Search Committee was instructed to look for a successor in- terested in an interdisciplinary approach to education. In any event, when Neal Rudenstine accepted the job one of the first things that he did was to appoint a Provost to focus on the promotion of an interdisciplina ly relationship between the various faculties. And President Rudenstine in his report on his first two years remarked: "The purpose of thinking is action." For me, with my general semantics influenced point of view, this is a departure from the traditional curriculum which calls for stuffing information into students' memories so that they can give it back during exam time - and then, if it is not important to them, they can forget it. What one learns "in action" remains in one's consciousness far longer than what we only learn from spoken or written words, for this involves the "organism as a whole." For me, the case system, already mentioned as a principal teaching tool used at the Harvard Business School, did just that. I still remember the single question asked in my last exam at the Harvard Business School in 1931. "Discuss the problems of the Ford Motor Company when it abandoned the Model T for the Model A." We had three hours to write our answer. I had just bought a Model A so the question hit home. Dr. Rachel Lauer and Pace University Since 1985, 1 have supported Rachel Laueťs work at Pace University in New York City. Bob Redpath, whom I had known when we both served on the Board of the Institute of General Semantics, introduced me to Rachel. Her ability to translate Korzybski's ideas and Sam Bois' interpretation of them into the vernacular had made a deep impression on me. Her direction of the Thinking and Learning Center at Pace had the enthusiastic support of President Bill Sharwell</page><page sequence="13">38 Etcetera • Spring 1997 and Provost Joe Pastore. Unfortunately, when Sharwell re- signed he was succeeded by someone whose perspective did not include an interest in interdisciplinary education. In our first conversations she told me that it was at the bottom of "her list of priorities"! Dr. Lauer, I believe, has an unusual ability to make general semantics formulations accessible to people who would have trouble reading the primary literature. She headed the Psy- chology Department of the New York City School Depart- ment in the 1970s with some 500 psychologists in the city school reporting to her. Her P.E.D.A. description of the steps involved in the pro- cess of decision-making gives one a very easy way of keeping the stages of the process in one's head. The first stage seems to explain how one may perceive, at a very early age, some aspect of "reality" out there in the territory which, in time, can determine to a significant degree the individual's per- spective and career. Very recently, I have read of some re- search that suggests that Laueťs P and E stages may very often happen almost simultaneously - i.e., that a first Evaluation may take place immediately after Perception. Critical Thinking I find it encouraging that there seems to be a growing in- terest in "critical thinking" among leaders in primary and secondary education. Annual summer gatherings of many of these professionals take place at Sonoma State University in California. These meetings have been organized by Richard Paul, a professor at Sonoma State. He delivered the Kor- zybski Memorial Address in 1987. I find it puzzling that general semantics has not found greater acceptance in this field. As George Hanford, the for- mer head of the College Board, states: "Behind the Critical Thinking movement is Korzybski's work, but no one will ad- mit it."</page><page sequence="14">"My Map was not the T erritory " 39 I have noted resistance at the Harvard Business School. Some faculty members objected to an interdisciplinary ap- proach to education. I suppose this is due to the fact that their careers are based on their specialties such as marketing, advertising, finance, statistics, etc. It is undoubtedly upsetting to them to find that what one has studied in depth for years is still only part of the whole picture. The general semantics approach would automatically add "etc.," to any specialty, especially if the proposal was to study and teach the process of decision making! Perhaps this is beginning to change. Rachel Laueťs courses have just been made part of the core curriculum at Pace. The College Board is investigating critical thinking and its rele- vance to the SAT College Admission tests. A few changes in the SAT examinations have already been made. One major university seems headed in a positive direction. On July 26, 1996, President Gerhard Casper of Stanford Uni- versity addressed a letter to all alumni. It contained this para- graph: With implementation anticipated within three years, Stan- ford Introductory Studies will recast the formative first two years of college. The first year sets the tone and habit of critical thinking, and we thus will enroll each and every freshman in a small seminar taught by a tenure-track professor. Whatever discipline a student chooses to explore, the tools of thought and analysis developed in a seminar will be relevant to all pursuits of the intellect throughout life. As my friend Edward Levi once said, universities "are the custodians not only of the many cultures of man, but of the rational process itself." These remarks are encouraging. I hope that they include whatever is beneath the rational process, what Katherine Merseth calls "the keel." I have described at the beginning of this essay the happen- ing that shook up my nervous system. I imagine that others interested in general semantics could describe similar hap-</page><page sequence="15">40 Etcetera • Spring 1997 penings. Bob Lovetť s amusing comment as to how one de- velops good judgment by making bad judgments seems apt. One great gap in our educational curriculum, I believe, is lack of any insistence on the importance of self-knowledge, of getting to know our own epistemology. For this purpose I regard the structural differential an excellent tool. Only through self-knowledge can we understand the way we make decisions and, thus, how we manage our lives. After all, we make all kinds of decisions every day and even while asleep, some important, many unimportant. One obvious example is when we propose marriage to a potential spouse and that person decides to accept or reject the proposal. That, of course, is a major decision. But we make many minor decisions all day long, such as when we purchase this or that article of clothing. When I entered Harvard College, in the fall of 1923, I learned something the very first night. President A. Law- rence Lowell addressed 700 of us. "Gentlemen, if you have come here to get an education, you had better leave now. All you will know at the end of four years is how much you don't know." To me, that ties in very closely with the parab- ola at the top of the structural differential which refers to the infinite territory from which each of us can make very lim- ited abstractions. To take my own case, a very dramatic one, my wife had a high temperature when we were vacationing in Rome some thirty years ago. I had been warned that if she developed a high temperature I should get her an injection of penicillin right away. That was all I had been told. I pur- chased the penicillin and her temperature went down quickly. But I didn't know what I didn't know, and that was that the high temperature had caused complications includ- ing fibrillation of the heart, i.e. an uneven rhythm. A month or so later she developed a clot in her brain and had an em- bolism which incapacitated her at the young age of 52. Since then she has had to take prescription medicine to prevent clotting. For one so beautiful and full of life, humor, and good will, it was a terrible blow.</page><page sequence="16">"My Map was not the T erritory " 41 I met my wife after I arrived with the army in England in 1944. We have known each other for almost 53 years and celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary in 1997. Thanks to her, Korzybski, Bois, and many others, I have gained a great deal of self knowledge. Falling in love with her changed my whole outlook. My love replaced my egotistical ambitions to compete and establish my name in the marketplace of repu- tations. However, it took years of consciousness of abstract- ing to realize what had taken place, in other words, to get to the "keel" of my nervous system. Of course, I still have fur- ther depths to plumb, an ongoing process that never termi- nates until one dies. Lastly, please forgive this personal story, an account of how general semantics has helped me live my life, as true and honest an account as I can give. If I were a teacher, like Rachel Lauer, I would tell it differently. But general seman- tics has given me a glimpse, and it reflects the wisdom of President Lowell's remarks long ago concerning the impor- tance of knowing what we don't know, - in other terms, re- membering that our map always needs to be dated and that IT IS NEVER THE TERRITORY. NOTE In discussing on Page 33 the "senior and retired member of the faculty who has been asked by the new Dean to review the situation of what use has been made of the funds donated by our family," I was refer- ring to Paul Lawrence who visited me here in Santa Barbara on Octo- ber 2, 1996. He was familiar with the history of the Chair and sympathetic to its purpose. As a result of his visit, the new Dean, Kim Clark, is considering the appointment to the Chair of Professor Mi- chael Jensen. He spent a day with me on January 27, 1997 and seems to me to be interested and splendidly qualified to get the project back on track. (RKS 2/4/97) Attached: Letter that my brother Jack and I wrote to Dean Fouraker of the Harvard Business School in 1973 endowing a Chair to study the process of decision-making based on Korzybski's Science and Sanity and his interpreters.</page><page sequence="17">42 Et cetera • Spring 1997 APPENDIX Letter addressed to Dean Lawrence A. Fouraker, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University: November 1, 1973 Dear Dean Fouraker, As you know, our father, Jesse Isidor Straus, and his brothers, Percy S. and Herbert N. Straus, endowed the Isidor Straus Chair of Business His- tory at the Business School in 1927. Father was at that time Chairman of the Visiting Committee and much interested in what was still a new and fledgling type of academic institution. As President Lowell used to say when justifying its existence, "Business was the oldest of the arts, but the newest of the professions." In 1930 Father was very active in helping Dean Donham organize the Associates of The Harvard Business School, a story which has recently been retold by former Assistant Dean John C. Baker in the Harvard Busi- ness School Bulletin of November-December 1971. It is the Associates who have, over the years, provided the money for the gathering of the cases which are so basic a part of the teaching materials used in class. It was also at this time that the Fatigue Laboratory, now known as the Department of Human Relations, was developing under the direction of Elton Mayo and Lawrence J. Henderson, and F.J. Roethlisberger was em- barking on his famed studies at the Western Electric plant in Hawthorne, Illinois. Father was very interested in this research, having been, we be- lieve, among the first business executives to introduce psychiatry into a personnel department. Our family's interest in the Business School has continued down to the third and fourth generations, with at least one member serving on the Visiting Committee for twenty-seven years, and ten members having attended either the Advanced Management Program, or qualified for the MBA degree. About five years ago it first appeared that it might be possible for us to create a chair in memory of our father as he and his brothers had cre- ated a chair in memory of their father. A number of meetings were or- ganized by the late Assistant Dean John Fox and were attended by the Wallace B. Donham Professor Emeritus of Human Relations, F.J. Roeth- lisberger, and Associate and Assistant Deans George Lombard and John Whitney, at which all contributed their suggestions as to the most appro- priate area of activity. There was at least one meeting with your prede- cessor, Dean George P. Baker. In the discussions it appeared to us that a couple of paragraphs in a book review written by Professor Roethlisberger in the Harvard Business</page><page sequence="18">"My Map was not the T erritory " 43 Review of January 1948 and reprinted in 1968 in his book Man-in - Organization (1) as Chapter 4, "Human Relations 'Rare, Medium, or Well- Done/" might provide appropriate guidelines for a Jesse Isidor Straus Chair. We quote: This new integration (of various fields and techniques in the de- velopment of human relations), however, envisages a much closer relation between those who theorize and those who practice. Such a combination would be an intellectual achievement of the highest order, and also would require an apprenticeship - not only in the library but also in the hard, persistent labor of responsible practice in the handling of concrete human data. Although this integration would be ultimately of the greatest importance and utility, its devel- opment cannot be accelerated. If this integration is to be achieved at not merely a verbal level, it requires many years of patient labor at a clinical level before any significant experimental work can be done. Difficult problems of terminology, method, and theoretical formula- tions beset it from all sides. For its successful achievement, a new the- ory of action is required . It presents unquestionably the greatest intellectual challenge of the modern world . The Newton or Copernicus of this combina- tion has not yet appeared .... At the present date the field of general seman- tics seems to offer a fruitful lead to the development of this combination. In February 1937, Alfred Korzybski spent a month at the Business School. He gave a seminar in Baker Library. Elton Mayo, F.J. Roethlis- berger, Elliott Chappell, John Fox, and others attended. Apparently his ideas at least made an impression on F.J. Roethlisberger because years later he thought that they were still relevant to the mission of the school. Then, in 1951, Irving Lee, one of Korzybski's ablest followers, visited the School for three months and attended classes, focusing his attention on the School's case method of instruction. His presence renewed the interest in the Korzybski formulations. His book Customs and Crises in Communication was one of the results of the time he spent there. We think the field of general semantics does offer a fruitful lead to the development of the integration referred to by Professor Roethlisberger above, though we realize that it may not be the only approach. What is important to us is to encourage further studies of these problems of per- ception, evaluation, and communication that Korzybski pointed to in his book Science and Sanity, (2) and their relation to the problem of the inte- gration of theories of knowledge and action that Roethlisberger referred to in the quotation above. These problems, as we conceive them, are not separate, but related problems - every action is of necessity based on some theory of reality, conscious or unconscious. Korzybski's major work Science and Sanity had the subtitle of An Intro- duction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics . Throughout his</page><page sequence="19">44 Et cetera • Spring 1997 work, Korzybski uses the symbol Ä to denote the non- Aristotelian system and he called for the creation of an international non-Aristotelian library, for which his first two books, Manhood of Humanity (3) and Science and Sanity were to be the cornerstone. Korzybski was not very fond of phi- losophy, but he did admit on page 78 of Science and Sanity that "a few 'philosophers' really do important work.... This class of workers I call epistemologists, to avoid the disagreeable implications of the term 'phi- losopher/ Unfortunately, epistemological researches are most difficult owing mainly to the lack of scientific psycho-logics, general semantics, and investigations of structure and s.r. (s.r. stands for semantic reactions). We found only a very few men doing this work, which, in the main, is still little known and unapplied. It must be granted that their works do not make easy reading. They do not command headlines; nor are they aided and stimulated by public interest and help." It must be emphasized again that as long as we remain humans (which means a symbolic class of life), the rulers of symbols will rule us, and that no amount of revolution will ever change this. But what mankind has a right to ask - and the sooner the better - is that our rulers should not be so shamelessly ignorant and, therefore, pathological in their reactions. If a psychiatrical and scientific en- quiry were to be made upon our rulers, mankind would be appalled at the disclosures .... It should be mentioned perhaps, that the main epistemological principle which has led to the writing of the works of the present author was a definite inclination to abandon identification and the resulting structurally unsatisfactory el language in general use, and to produce a non-el system, which, in structure, would be similar to the world around us, ourselves and our nervous system included. This structural novelty was the foundation on which the Ā-system has been gradually built. Now for the first time we are beginning to see Korzybski's basic point of view and perhaps it will help us to understand why, ever since Science and Sanity was first published, there has been so much misunderstanding of what he was driving at. He was interested in language, to be sure, but mainly because he regarded language as hopelessly elementalistic, the structure of which had to be changed if we were to achieve a saner epis- temological point of view. He refers to the writings of Mach who he says was a deep student of epistemology and who had great influence on Loeb and Einstein. (Ernst Mach was the Austrian physicist from whose work the term "Mach 1" (the speed of sound) is derived.) Korzybski paraphrases some remarks of Mach as follows, "Not every individual knows or realizes the importance of, or seemingly consciously cares for epistemology; yet everyone unconsciously has one and acts and</page><page sequence="20">"My Map was not the T erritory " 45 lives by it. Each individual has his own special problems, the solution of which always claims the whole man, and no man is complete, unless he consciously realizes the permanent presence in his own life of some stan- dards of evaluation. Everyone has thus some epistemology. There is no way of parting with it, - nor with air, nor with water, - and live. The only problem is whether his standards of evaluation are polluted with primi- tive remains of bygone ages, in a variety of ways; or sanifíed by science and modern epistemology/' (4) In the last chapter of Science and Sanity, starting at the bottom of page 726, Korzybski attributes the great progress in the physical sciences to the revision of the epistemological assumptions which were themselves based upon the development of a new language with a new structure. But he refers to his distress over the continuation of the old Aristotelian system in our daily life as follows: Without legislating about the 'truth' or 'falsehood' of the newer mechanics, as a matter of human behavior these theories are the best indications and examples of the structure of human 'knowledge/ which I have attempted to formulate in this work as a general the- ory. The A-system was strictly interconnected with primitive-made structural assumptions or metaphysics, reflected in the structure of the older languages and in the elementalistic notions about lan- guage, 'psychology/ 'logic/ and the pre-scientific anthropomorphic astronomy, physics, and other disciplines. Of late, science has devel- oped in spite of all handicaps and persecutions, and has begun to depart structurally and semantically from the path of aristotelianism and the dark ages. Every science has had to build its own language and this fact completely condemns the A language, which, it is shocking to notice, we continue to preserve in our daily life. Should we wonder that we have shown hardly any progress at all in our purely human affairs and notions? We should wonder, rather, that we been able to survive until now - though with need- less difficulties and suffering. More wars, more revolutions, more insanity, more morons, more struggle and competition, and more unhappiness are what we are entitled to expect and predict as the out- come of this structurally and semantically impossible situation. As the organism works as-a-whole, such things as 'pure intellect' or 'pure emotions' represent structurally elementalistic fictions and scientists should realize that their professed detached scientific atti- tude is profoundly and fundamentally unjustified. All science has 'emotional' components, which play most important roles in life. If we live in a modern world, but keep the 'emotional attitudes' of primitive bygone days, then naturally we are bound to be semanti-</page><page sequence="21">46 Et cetera • Spring 1997 cally unbalanced, and cannot be adjusted to a fundamentally primi- tive 'civilization' in the midst of great technical achievements. When scientists understand that, then the layman will have a different attitude toward science. He will understand that science is not a privilege of the few, something without effect upon all and every one. He will realize that while he lives in a modern world, made so by science, structural ignorance of the fundamentals as discovered by science leaves him with primitive structural assumptions or meta- physics, which by necessity build for him a delusional world leading to semantic unbalance and ultimately to 'mental' and nervous ills. From the non-elementalistic point of view, the only escape is to re- alize that ignorance in an adult is, and must be, pathological, be- cause 'knowledge' is to be considered as a normal characteristic of human nervous tissue. A special structural and methodological brief and simplified ac- count of scientific achievements, such as I have attempted in this work, must be part of a theory of sanity . Sanity means adjustment and without the minimum of the best structural knowledge of each date concerning this world, such adjustment is impossible It is not necessary that the reader should fully understand all technical details of a theory, to be cavare (instinctive, affective, etc.) of the existence of the structural and semantic problems and to realize that some of the most competent and skilled professionals are work- ing at these theories. Such awareness has great pacifying semantic influence; it eliminates the older affective tensions which were due to identifications, absolutism, dogmatism, flights into mysticism, and other pathological disturbances. A non-aristotelian system must deal with all these structural and semantic issues. It is hoped that once a Ä-system is presented to the public, scientists and laymen will become more interested in the structural and semantic issues emphasized here, and that new and wider researches will be undertaken. History shows that such hopes are not illusory. The greatest men of science have always had wide human aims and interests. From the non-elementalistic point of view, they probably became produc- tive geniuses because of this broad human urge. From the point of view of psychiatry, it is well known that 'mental' ills involve usually anti-social affective attitudes. When we see men with distinctly anti- social tendencies, no matter how they rationalize them, they are in- variably ill in some way. A fully healthy individual is never anti- social. That science should include structural and semantic factors of sanity may be a startling notion, but only at first! In the present</page><page sequence="22">"My Map was not the T erritory " 47 analysis this turns out to be, rather unexpectedly, a necessity. But on second consideration we should rather expect it. Science and mathe- matics show the working of the "human mind' at its best. Accord- ingly, we can learn from science and mathematics how this "human mind' should work, to be at its best. Then we should make an analysis of science and mathematics from some wider structural and seman- tic point of view - the task which has been undertaken in the pre- sent work. At this early stage it is, of course, of comparatively little impor- tance to what extent this analysis turns out to be satisfactory. The main point is that it has been originated. If the present author fails, others, perhaps even because of his failure, may be stimulated to do it better. The great and vital thing is that it should be done, by some- one. In this concluding chapter of Science and Sanity, Korzybski has out- lined the relationships that he sees between the structure of language and the resulting epistemology. He claims that what he calls a non- Aristotelian system , if it could be substituted in daily life for the Aristote- lian system that is built into our daily language, would have an enor- mously "healthy" effect on human behavior. And, very modestly, Korzybski in the last paragraph says that it doesn't really matter whether his "analysis turns out to be satisfactory. The main point is that it has been originated and that if he fails, perhaps some of his followers will be stimulated to do better. "The great and vital thing is that it should be done by someone ." Although we are not too concerned about the name to be given to these studies or to the Chair, we hope the name will not be one that has already been co-opted by one of the disciplines or established schools of thought or frames of reference. Obviously the studies we have in mind would have a close bearing upon such matters as 'executive develop- ment' or 'the decision-making process' or 'interpersonal behavior7 or 'cognitive psychology7 and so on, but if possible, we should like to avoid such labels around which there have already developed a lot of accrued meanings. The difficulties of finding an appropriate label will be dis- cussed in the next pages of this letter, as well as the label that seems most suitable to us at this time - "epistemics." In discussing the proposed Chair with Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, Director Emeritus of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace and class- mate of one of us, we were referred to Allison's study of the Cuban Mis- sile Crisis (5) and the decision-making process that resulted in a peaceful solution. In looking back on what was surely one of the most momentous deci- sions ever made in American history - the embargo decision that re-</page><page sequence="23">48 Et cetera • Spring 1997 solved the Cuban Missile Crisis - President Kennedy said 'The essence of ultimate derision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, in- deed to the derider himself ... there will always be the dark and tangled stretches in the derision-making process - mysterious to those who may be the most intimately involved/' We would like the occupant of the Chair to have a high degree of awareness of "the dark and tangled stretches in the decision-making process " and be committed to exploring them in depth. We would hope that, in time, they might become less mysterious to him and his students . While, thanks to Johnson and Allison, we have used the Missile Crisis as a model of what we have in mind, we believe that any derision, whether in the public or the private sector of human activity, involves these "dark and tangled stretches/' though obviously the unraveling is more important to humans in a missile crisis than in a derision on the part of General Motors as to whether or not, for example, to go into pro- duction with the Wankel engine. But as of November 1, 1973, we believe, that study of and heightening of awareness of the process will be as hu- manly useful in one area as in the other. In fact, the place to begin may well be in the private sector, with which the Business School is primarily concerned, since making future business leaders more aware of how their whole life-experience plays a part in the way they make derisions will, we believe, make them more effective in both the private and the public sectors. In the language of 1973, "knowing who you are" (the colloquial equivalent of being aware of your epistemology as compared with the epistemologies of other people) is where any exploration of the derision- making process has to begin. We believe some humans find out earlier than others "who they are," but whether they can understand the origins and limitations of their own evaluations - of how they abstract - and compare it with the evaluations of others, may not be as quickly avail- able. Awareness of these "epistemological" problems is, in our view, very basic to any exploration of the derision-making process. Many students of Korzybski's approach today feel that it is unfortu- nate that he applied the label "general semantics" to his Non-A discipline; and that he himself had some doubt about it is revealed in his unpub- lished correspondence with Arthur Bentley. M. Kendig, Charlotte Read, and J. Samuel Bois prefer the label "applied epistemology," largely be- cause the everyday colloquial understanding of "semantics" restricts it to the "meaning of words," a complete distortion of Korzybski's focus. In a paper published in the June 1971 issue of ETC., the publication of the International Society of General Semantics, Bois spoke out on this question of terminology:</page><page sequence="24">"My Map was not the T erritory " 49 Those of us who have continued the work of Korzybski have for years been in the ridiculous situation of people who claimed that we were dealing with improved methods of communication while we were unable to give our own discipline a name that made sense to outsiders. This long and painful period of confusion has come to an end with the publication of Michel Foucaulťs book The Order of Things. (6) Foucault revives Ferrieťs notion of epistemology, but he gives it a broader meaning than we find in current literature. Instead of re- stricting it to a theory of intellectual knowledge, of which logic is the main part, he uses it to cover the general system of knowing-feeling- behaving that constitutes the dynamic background of our ostensive behav- ior This general system - properly called episteme - determines the pat- tern of how we speak, write, act, establishes rules and practices, and set up permanent institutions. It refers to what I have called in The Art of Awareness (7) our structured unconscious . In a culture at a certain date, writes Foucault, there is only one episteme; it determines the conditions that make possible any kind of knowing, whether this knowing expresses itself in a theory or is silently embodied in a practice. And so, we now have three clear-cut terms to describe what we are busy with. All three are implied in the tradition of general se- mantics. 1. Episteme or the general systems of knowing that were dominant in our culture at different times of history. The present one has emerged from previous epistemes that go back to our Judeo- Christian, Greco-Roman origins as a civilization. Each of us has his own individual version of it in what I called elsewhere our 'structured unconscious/ This can be described as the dynamic pattern of attitudes, habits, internalized values, modes of perceiv- ing and thinking by which each person relates himself to the world of things and people, observes and judges their activities, and expresses himself to himself and to the world by what he thinks, says, and does. 2. Epistemology, or the science of episteme. It obtains its information from a continuous survey of all the sciences of man, organizing their findings in a set of postulates and formulations that aims at being simple and teachable. 3. Epistemics, or the discipline derived from epistemology .... It takes Homo Sapiens as the only form of life that can influence the course of his own evolution. It has for its objective the knowledge and the practice of the skills of awareness and self-management.</page><page sequence="25">50 Et cetera • Spring 1997 In a sense, this is a new science and discipline. Or, better said, it is an attempt to translate into scientific terms the wisdom of the ages, including our own as the most advanced. Epistemics covers the whole range of man's activities in the arts, in science, in politics, in administrative work and business transactions, in person-to-person encounters, in family life, in education - wherever and whenever human beings are functioning. Bois, in an earlier article "General Semantics and the Growth Centers" had said: Episteme is what makes a Frenchman different from a German, an American different from an Englishman, a Zen monk different from a nuclear physicist, a Mormon different from a Unitarian, a poet different from an engineer, Einstein different from Galileo, or Whitehead different from Aristotle. A particular episteme may exist as a sub-system within a broader episteme. The religious episteme of Billy Graham and that of the Pope are different as subsystems, but they both belong to the overarching episteme of the Christian tradition. This, in turn, together with the non-Christian epistemes of the Jews, the Humanists, and the Unitarians, belong to the over- arching episteme of the Western culture. This culture itself will eventually have to become an epistemic sub-system of the whole planetary noosphere, as Pierre Teilhard de Chardin describes the totality of humankind. We know from personal experience that this transformation is a laborious process. All these epistemes have in common the fact that they are the product, and in a circular manner the determinant, of the activities that are specific to human beings, as different from all other forms of life, plants and animals. Men are different because they attach a meaning to whatever happens to them, whatever they do. The dis- tinctively human world is a world of happenings-meanings, in which our total functioning selves, physical, mental, purposive and emotional, are fully involved. Our human world is a network of sig- nificances in dynamic interaction. This is what Korzybski and Bent- ley meant by calling semantics, or science of significances, the discipline they were concerned with. Foucault calls it epistemology, the science of episteme, and I prefer his terminology. It covers the whole field of human activities, not only the intellectual or affective significances, but also the practices, the whole realm of reality that Pitirim A. Sorokin describes as, a) an infinitely rich ideological uni- verse of meanings unified into systems of language, science, tech- nology, etc., b) a material culture representing an incarnation and objectification of all these meanings, beginning with simple tools and ending with the most complex machinery, with buildings, vil-</page><page sequence="26">"My Map was not the T erritory " 51 lages and cities, etc., c) the totality of individuals as socio-cultural role-players, such as 'kings/ 'farmers/ 'citizens/ 'husbands/ 'wives/ as well as the totality of cultural groups, political, scientific, religious, economic, etc., and finally d) the totality of overt actions, ceremo- nies, rituals, proceedings, in which individuals and groups actualize and practice this or that set of meanings. (8) Bois was, we believe, the first person to apply the ideas of Korzybski to business management. He had organized a business consulting firm in Montreal on which he reported to the 1949 Denver Congress of General Semantics. He developed a course called Executive Methods which be- came the program of a number of management firms in New York, Chi- cago, and San Francisco that originated from his initiative. So we suggest that the Jesse Isidor Straus Professor, whoever he may be, should focus on the area which Bois describes as epistemics since there is pretty much of a consensus among the closest students of Kor- zybski that this is as good a term as any available. We are confident that this focus will be relevant to the training of business executives, whether for activity in the private or the public sector. If the Straus Chair of Epistemics is too unfamiliar a label as of 1973, perhaps the Straus Chair of "Knowledge-in-Action," "Knowledge and Action in Concrete Systems," "Integrative Knowledge-in-Action" or "In- tegrative Studies for Action" could serve the purpose. We are convinced that actions, whatever their nature, are necessarily the product of the functioning of individual epistemes, - of what they have abstracted from the total "out there" and how they evaluated what they abstracted before they acted - or, in the case of a decision reached by a committee, a mix of the products of the individual epistemes in- volved in the process by which the decision was reached. These "action products" must necessarily emerge from the total life experience (Bois's "structured unconscious") of those who participate in the decision and influence those contributing to it; they are not solely or even mainly intellectual, but are the byproduct of the epistemes of the participants in the decision-making process. We believe that such a study will in time make a significant contribu- tion to the greater human development of graduate students, whether they go to work in the private or the public sector. And if it does this for students at the Business School, it should eventually have a healthy in- fluence in the larger society. We have been deliberately vague as to detail, but specific as to the area with which we would like to see the Chair concern itself. The key paragraph in the legal agreement that we have entered into with the President and Fellows of Harvard College is paragraph 1.3, which reads,</page><page sequence="27">52 Et cetera • Spring 1997 as revised in our letter of August 6, 1973, addressed to the President and Fellows of Harvard College as follows: The first incumbent of the Professorship shall be a professor con- cerned with the process of decision-making, whether in the public or the private sector, who is on or may be assigned to the faculty of the Graduate School of Business Administration ("GSBA") of Har- vard University. On the recommendation of the Dean of the GSBA and with the approval of Harvard, the Professorship may be trans- ferred to a different faculty or may be designated as a University Professorship and administered as such. The Dean of the GSBA may, if he chooses, rotate the incumbent of the chair from time to time or even from year to year, so as to bring the benefits of differ- ent points of view to bear on the process of decision-making. The incumbents of the Professorship may focus on any aspect of human behavior (including but not limited to problems of perception, evaluation, communication, human development and human rela- tions) deemed relevant to the making of decisions. While initially suggested by the work of Adelbert Ames, J.S. Bois, Hadley Cantril, Cassius J. Keyser, Alfred Korzybski, Henri Laborit, Irving Lee, Abra- ham H. Maslow, Warren S. McCulloch, F.S.C. Northrop, Roscoe Pound, F.J. Roethlisberger, Carl Rogers, Lancelot L. Whyte, Alfred North Whitehead, G.K. Zipf, and more recently by Michel Foucault, Graham Allison and others, no single label except perhaps "epis- temics" (as used by Bois) adequately describes the work to be en- compassed by the Professorship. It is the hope of the parties that out of the work of the incumbents of the Professorship, a new basis will in time emerge for an improved and teachable approach to the integration of knowl- edge and action and thus lead to greater human awareness of the complexity of the variables involved in the making of decisions. As the paragraph in the legal agreement states, the decision as to who shall occupy the chair is left to you, and you will also decide whether in time the chair should be transferred to another faculty of the University or made a University Chair without affiliation with any particular faculty. Recognizing with Roethlisberger, that it may be some time before the Newton or Copernicus necessary to research and expound 'a new theory of action' may appear, we agree that the funds which we are making available may be used, at your discretion, for research in the field until you are ready to make an appointment. This seems to us a very appropriate way in which to honor the mem- ory of our father, Jesse Isidor Straus, '93, who throughout his life was enormously interested in what Professor Roethlisberger called "a much closer relation between those who theorize and those who practice/'</page><page sequence="28">"My Map was not the T erritory " 53 We have supplemented this letter with an appendix containing a number of articles explaining in greater detail what this is all about. Sev- eral of the articles also contain bibliographies which will be helpful. The article by Korzybski ("The Role of Language in the Perceptual Pro- cesses") was the last article written before he died and is perhaps the best brief summary of his ideas available. Jack I.
