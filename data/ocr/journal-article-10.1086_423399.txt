Patton “A  GREAT  AND  STRANGE  CORRECTION” :   INTENTIONALITY ,   LOCALITY ,  AND   EPIPHANY IN  THE   CATEGORY OF  DREAM  INCUBATION Dream incubation represents a rich nexus of  cognitive, performative, loc- ative, and theological issues in the historical study of  religion. The ancient and widespread practice of  sleeping in a special place in order to receive a god-given dream was the centerpiece of  a complex of  charged ritual el- ements practiced to the present day. Such fixed, “strong” places existed around the world (temples, shrines, or churches and their precincts; graves, caves, and mountains, for example; but the transitory sacrificial fire might also be the site of  dream incubation).1 Pilgrimage, purification, and sac- rifice produce as their telos the efficacious dream, the “sought” dream2— 1 Wendy Doniger (O’Flaherty) cites A. M. Esnoul’s treatment of  Tantraloka 15: Master and disciple shared the dream that is dreamt near the sacrificial fire during initiation. See her “Hard and Soft Reality” (Parabola 7, no. 2 [1982]: 56 and n. 6), citing Esnoul, “Les songes et leur interprétation dans l’Inde,” in Les songes et leur interprétation, Sources Orientales (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1959), 2:321. 2 See the discussion of  the “sought” dream by Serenity Young, “Buddhist Dream Experi- ence: The Role of  Interpretation, Ritual, and Gender,” in Dreams: A Reader on the Reli- gious, Cultural, and Psychological Dimensions of Dreaming, ed. Kelly Bulkeley (New York: Palgrave, 2001), pp. 9–28 and esp. p. 12. Young’s emphasis is on the larger category that comprises all forms of  conscious seeking of  a dream, noting, in Buddhist biographical nar- ratives from India and Tibet the presence of  “the various ritual means to have a dream, such as performing a specific ritual, going to sleep in a sacred place, praying for a dream, or simply concentrating the mind before going to sleep.” Young asserts, “The progression from spon- taneous dream to sought dream is a reasonable development.

The dream’s meaning frequently requires decoding or interpre- tation, in some cases by the dreamer herself, although in most traditional oneiric systems, by an expert. The significance of  the incubated dream can be highly personal and even mundane in its details about “what to do” to ameliorate the specific condition of  the dreamer. Or the dream can be “big,” transpersonal, oracular, and of  relevance to the entire community. In classical antiquity, the response to a dream visit was generally an attempt to implement the god’s advice, often accompanied by the making of  a vow or thank-offering—perhaps the erection of  a stone or stele with an account of  the incubation and its aftermath—or the dedication of  a sculpture of  the healed body part to show the world what the god had done for the suppliant in her dreams. Inseparable from the concept of  in- cubation, we might add, is the place where the dream is dreamed, as well as the place of  the dream plot itself: the theater where its hieratic action occurs, that “other place” that cannot be found on the waking map of  em- pirical transaction. In August of  1994 I traveled as a pilgrim in the Holy Land to attend the great nocturnal celebration of  Jesus’ Transfiguration on Mount Tabor. There I stood through a four-hour liturgy in Greek and Arabic in the Orthodox Christian cathedral, at the New Testament site of  the metamor- phosis of  a Nazarene rabbi into a divinely illumined prophet in conver- sation with Moses and Elijah, while Peter, John, and James watched in shock (Matt. 17:1–8; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:28–36). After the liturgy, the congregation poured outside into the walled courtyard to witness, or better, to instigate a miracle which, as I learned, happened every year on this same night. When a group of  Russian nuns from a certain women’s monastery on the shore of  the Sea of  Galilee gathered there and sang the Greek transfiguration festal hymn, “I Metamorphosis,” a broad column of light, like a cloud, was annually seen to rise up about fifty yards away, from the shoulder of  the darkened hills nearby, and fly over the church. In fact, this is exactly what took place the night I watched. There followed a heated argument well before dawn between a priest who wished to debunk the flying pillar of  light miracle as something ex- plicable through meteorology, and a group of  Greek yiayiades, most in black widow’s weeds, who angrily defended its sanctity. And after that consciously setting out to have a dream, one still has received a prophecy” (p. 12). While this may be true, the impetus for incubation (“going to sleep in a sacred place”) might, I suggest, derive more naturally from the religious power of  the place itself, rather than the quest to have religiously valuable dreams. In other words, the starting point in a given incubation tra- dition could be the belief  that the place “does” many things of  metaphysical value, including sponsor iconic dreams for those who sleep there. </page> <page sequence="3"> 196 Dream Incubation agon was spent, many wandered out of  exhaustion back into the cathe- dral—pilgrims from Jerusalem, Beit Jala, or Greece—who had not brought sleeping bags or tents. And there they fell asleep, and there began to dream. I walked through the nave of  the cathedral at around five o’clock in the morning. I saw the sleepers there, stretched along the pews, on the marble floors, curled against the columns. There was no noise, only the animated, rustling silence of  breathing, slight movement, stirring. I remember think- ing at the time how strange it was to see people sleeping in public; even in airports, one is uncomfortable witnessing the intimate and defenseless act of  sleeping; one’s gaze feels exploitative. For sleeping and dreaming have become in Western culture something one does in private, in relative isolation. I was even more struck to see them sleeping in a holy place, for European and American sanctuaries are decorous places of  the daytime, locked up like vaults at night against theft, and are by no means used for collective sleeping. Although these pilgrims did not sleep in the Mount Tabor cathedral in- tentionally to incubate dreams, Orthodox Christians go to other “marked” churches throughout the Mediterranean to this day to do just that. At Ta- bor I was able to begin to imagine what mass incubations might have looked like in the ancient world—at the shrine of  Asklepios in the great long abaton of  Epidauros, where the bearded compassionate god, per- haps in the form of  a great snake, appeared to the dreamers asleep on their klinai to prescribe remedies; or the sanctuary at Kos, where in dreams he wiped away disease with his hand; or the mysterious round building at the Asklepieion at Pergamon in Asia Minor with its wide-cut channels for purifying water to run through the healing chambers, where, accord- ing to the account of  the second-century c.e. orator and hypochondriac, Aelius Aristides of  Smyrna, the god once came in a dream to his foster father and prescribed that his (Aelius’s) bones and nerves had to be re- moved, “for the existing ones had failed.” According to the dream doctor, these defective elements could not simply be cut out and replaced. Instead, there needed to be “a certain change of  those existing, and thus there was need of  a great and strange correction.”3 The sought dream never left things status quo. What about the category of  “incubation”? Where does it come from; what does it mean; and what does it describe? With its Latin etymology, “incubation” implies the action of  lying down, and in its application, the idea of  gestating in the dark, characteristically in a small enclosed space. The Latin cubile (whence our modern “cubicle,” the beelike cell of  office workers) means “bed; nest; lair, kennel.” In modern biological incuba- tion, a period of  heat hatches new living creatures. 3 P.

A large crowd surrounded us, watching at least a hundred or more chicks dwelling beneath the heat and the bright light, developing at various stages from egg-hood to the complete glory of  fuzzy new wings, bopping into one another. Every fifteen minutes or so the farmer god would appear, remove their cover, and hydrate them all into complete confusion with a bottle mister. We could have stayed there for hours. How much more astonishing to witness a premature infant struggle to thrive in the lit artificial womb of  a neonatal incubator. In ancient dream incubation, ritual sleep hatched potent dreams that diagnosed the dreamer, initiated her in special wisdom, or served as ora- cles. As has been suggested, the simplest way to classify incubation is as a special subset of  oneiromancy, divination through dreams. In Mesopo- tamia, as Leo Oppenheim has shown, and throughout the ancient Medi- terranean, dream divination was a highly developed field of  knowledge, and dream classification a systematic undertaking.4 So too incubation, the deliberate hatching of  dreams at special places, was equally developed. Benjamin Kilborne observes, “Incubation provides us with a fine example of  a process for acquiring knowledge, assuaging suffering, and seeking divine assistance through an individual rite that relies on social practices. As it is often physical suffering that prompts the individual to use dreams to effect a cure, and as the dreamer who encounters the divinity often obeys divine counsel, there is no way of  dividing incubation into knowledge on the one hand and action on the other.”5 Although “incubation” is a term from the ancient Occidental world, it currently and problematically enjoys an expanded, almost impression- istic usage; it is taken to mean any kind of  intentional sleeping to pro- duce dreams. “Incubation” is used by religionists to describe phenomena ranging from the quest for visionary dreams (such as the one undertaken by modern Cree artist Shirley Cheechoo at Dreamer’s Rock on the White Fish Reserve in Ontario) to the therapeutic dreaming about specific unre- solved personal situations that is encouraged in some schools of  human- istic psychoanalysis. In the first usage just mentioned, Barbara Tedlock deploys the term “in- cubation” to describe an event where the subject self-consciously draws on the vision quest tradition known throughout Native American cultures, 4 A.

Barbara Tedlock (Santa Fe, N.M.: School of  American Research Press, 1992), p. 176. 5 Benjamin Kilborne, s.v. “Dreams,” in The Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. Mircea Eliade (New York: Macmillan, 1988), 4:486. </page> <page sequence="5"> 198 Dream Incubation a tradition theorized by Lee Irwin in his study of  nineteenth-century Plains peoples.6 Tedlock tells how Cheechoo and two friends prayed, burned to- bacco and sweetgrass, and slept. They awoke. “As the new day was to begin a hole in the sky appeared and started to form a circle.” A beam of light came down, surrounded them; Cheechoo recounts, “I could see the sparkles of  light around me. I knew the spirits were there. I knew I had touched another level of  existence.”7 Note that the dreamer does not dream this vision and perceive its spir- itual aperture while still asleep, but instead experiences it while awake. In keeping with much Native American epistemology, dreaming and waking vision are rightly not distinguished in this account; they are virtually the same modality of  revelation and transformation. But then “incubation” does not correspond to a similar thought complex in the ancient world. For Tedlock, the sleeping aspect of  classical incubation is not mandatory for the term’s legitimate use, whereas in antiquity there was no incuba- tion without falling asleep, for how else could one dream? In the second case mentioned above, at the other end of  the spectrum, one encounters the work of  the analyst Carl Meier, who through his study of the ancient dream incubations of  the Asklepieia, equally self-consciously pioneered the use of  deliberate sleeping to produce healing dreams in psychotherapy. In this usage of  “incubation,” Meier’s tendency overly to spiritualize the ancient cult of  Asklepios in an attempt to validate this appropriation is plain.8 Certainly cures at these shrines included recog- nizably contemporary holistic therapies such as rest, exercise, psychol- ogy, bathing, and engagement in music and drama, but also weird and wonderful measures such as the eating of  figs mixed with ashes from the god’s altar, naked marathons in freezing rain, abstinence from bathing for weeks, and bodily suspension upside down for long periods of  time. Accounts of  dream cures often included graphic directives for radical sur- gery, and an entire set of  surgical instruments was excavated at Epidauros, perhaps to enact a surgery stipulated in an incubated dream.9 Ancient in- 6 See Lee Irwin, The Dream Seekers: Native American Visionary Traditions of the Great Plains (Norman: University of  Oklahoma Press, 1994). 7 Barbara Tedlock, “Sharing and Interpreting Dreams in Amerindian Nations,” in Dream Cultures: Explorations in the Comparative History of Dreaming, ed. David Shulman and Guy G. Stroumsa (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 98. 8 See Carl Meier, Ancient Incubation and Modern Psychotherapy, trans. Monica Curtis (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1967). 9 It is true that the iatroi, the physicians who were themselves mortal disciples of  Asklep- ios, were notoriously loathe to take on hopeless cases. The god would take them himself. As one thank-offering at Epidauros, that of  Aeschines the Orator, reads, “Having despaired of the skill of  mortals, but with every hope in the divine, forsaking Athens, I was healed in three months of  a festering wound which I had had on my head for a whole year.” Thus the patients who came to the shrines of  Asklepios were desperate for miracles, and grateful for even the smallest relief, and we are not wrong in ascribing a kind of  psychological urgency to the at- mosphere of  miraculous cures that prevailed there. This by no means necessarily invalidates One Line Long </page> <page sequence="6"> History of Religions 199 cubations, no matter how elaborated their symbolic expression, usually produced highly practical dream recommendations or predictions, and this was most markedly true in the case of  dream cures for specific afflictions. The modern psychotherapeutic impulse to sublimate this ancient form of medicine is far from an organic (i.e., obvious) development. Furthermore, for Meier, the place of  sleeping to produce such thera- peutic dreams is not important, nor is the intervention of  a dreamed god per se, apart from the extent to which the therapeutic process is itself  hy- postasized (or dream symbolism is sacralized as personal revelation). In this deployment of  “incubation,” we have lost the element of  divine epiph- any, an ancient sine qua non, whereby the autonomous divine power al- lows itself  to be summoned. We might evaluate in the same light the collaborative work of  Janet Son- enberg of  the drama department at the Massachusetts Institute of  Tech- nology and psychoanalyst Robert Bosnak. Sonenberg and Bosnak have developed incubation techniques to improve dramatic consciousness and performance, as they explain in their recent Dreamwork for Actors.10 The actor sleeps as (or for) the character he portrays, often focusing on a scene with which he is having trouble. The dreams are taken as though those of  the character portrayed, not as the dreams of  the actor himself. This is a modern variant on the ancient practice of  “sleeping by proxy” in order to receive revelatory dreams for another. Awake, the actor “works” the dreams into his body, always as a dream of  his character. As a result of  the “incubation” and the dreamwork, performance becomes less styl- ized, less overly cerebral on stage; and, as Bosnak puts it, “the acting has a deeper feel.” Now, intentional dreaming is here, surely, but where is the sanctuary, the holy place of  incubation, in this method? One might argue, as Bosnak does, that the play itself  is the “place,” and this is fair enough. Dreams themselves always seem to occur in another “place.” As Lord Byron wrote in his 1816 poem “The Dream,” “Our life is two-fold: Sleep hath its own world, / A boundary between the things misnamed / Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world, / And a wide realm of  wild reality.” But then we have strayed far from the highly determined “strong” place of  classi- cal incubation, the abaton where one may not walk unbidden. Thus one might also argue that the term “incubation” in such applica- tions has become unanchored from its original semantic field of  mean- ing. Perhaps this is always the way of  religious terms and even terms of their historicity. Psychosomatic cases were highly susceptible to cure, because sufferers had every confidence that the god would heal them. However, we have no real grounds for doubt- ing that cures of  verifiable medical conditions also occurred, and internal orientation could have also played a significant role in these cases, as it does to this day. 10 Janet Sonenberg, Dreamwork for Actors (New York: Routledge, 2003). </page> <page sequence="7"> 200 Dream Incubation religious scholarship once they begin to drift and multiply; comparative study is especially susceptible. It might be useful, then, as an exercise, to return to the historical world of  incubation’s origin, to its homeland, to see what the ritual originally entailed, and whether these identifiably separate components are—or are not—indispensable to its meaning. A comparable analysis might be undertaken vis-à-vis the word “sha- man” (saman) in the history of  religion. The home of  “shaman” is the Tungus-speaking people of  Eastern Siberia of  the seventeenth century and earlier; the Russian orthodox cleric Avvakum Petrovich, deported by the czar to Siberia in 1672, was the first to use the Tungus word saman in published text. The term, in his account, is elaborated by “diviner” and “this villain of  a magician”; the saman, in response to the consultation of the Russian head of  an expedition to wage war against the Mongols, sac- rifices a live ram, screams, dances, and invokes “the demons” who possess him and ultimately predict through him, tragically incorrectly, that the expedition will be a great success.11 Through polemical accounts such as this one, a picture emerges of  the saman as a medium of  spirits and inter- preter of  otherworldly powers, while other accounts and drawings depict him as a drummer, a singer, a ventriloquist, and a trickster or shape-shifter who wears animal skins and horns and can imitate animal sounds. Tungus shamans claimed “remote” healing and harming powers as well as divi- natory powers, and the ability to “influence the weather or the availabil- ity of  game.”12 As chronicled by Jeremy Narby and Francis Huxley, Europeans in their world travels often preserved indigenous terms such as pagé, piayí, an- gaqok, and saman in their accounts to describe “special” individuals who communicated with spirits especially to heal or to divine, even when in the same breath they also used “sorcerer,” “wizard,” and “conjurer” in Spanish, French, or German. Eventually, however, Swiss anthropologist Alfred Métraux in 1944 deliberately used the Siberian shaman to describe his subjects, who were Amazonian piai far from Siberia, defining shaman as “any individual who maintains by profession and in the interest of  the community an intermittent commerce with spirits, or who is possessed by them.”13 Going further, in his 1951 phenomenological study, Shaman- 11 Avvakum Petrovich, La vie de l’Archprêtre Avaakum, ecrite par lui-même (Paris: Gal- limard, 1938), translated into French from Russian by Pierre Pascal from the 1672 Russian original, and from French to English by Jeremy Narby and Francis Huxley. 12 See the discussion in the edited collection of  primary sources on shamanism assembled by Jeremy Narby and Francis Huxley, eds., Shamans through Time: 500 Years on the Path to Knowledge (New York: Jeremy P.

Eliade’s “shaman” has far more in common with the Lurianic master Hayyim Vital of  Safed, who used ritual weeping as a technique for achieving mystical ascent,15 than she or he does with an emergency room physician. But in the se- mantic field of  the Tungus word saman, this would be entirely backward: spirit journeys are never an end in themselves. The shaman’s traditional vocation is analogous to that of  the doctor, not the mystic; only the tech- nologies of  healing differ, and those perhaps less than we might imagine. Eliade rejected as the “degeneration” of  pure ecstatic technique the use of  hallucinogens and psychotropic drugs, although in the last years of  his life he apparently changed his mind.16 The adept Maria Sabina, who intro- duced Gordon Wasson to the ecstatic cult of  mushrooms, was, because of his description in Life magazine of  his night of  visionary power and orac- ular insight, frequently called a “Mazatec shaman.”17 Yet the beleaguered Sabina later told the Mexican journalist Alvaro Estrada that “before Was- son, nobody took the mushrooms simply to find God. One had always taken them to heal the sick.”18 In other words, the element of  healing that was essential to the practice of  Tungus shamanism in its historical and religious context has been fre- quently subsumed in a much looser use of  the comparative rubric “sha- man,” which now means something like “a trafficker in spirits” and can be applied to anyone from a Nuer leopard-skin priest to a male Caucasian part-time drummer in Maine. Therefore, does the term mean much of  any- thing anymore? “Incubation” is not only a technical term in the study of  religion and dream studies; it also translates into English a cultic term or phrase in various languages, with very specific associated fields of  meaning. In an- cient Greek, for example, the term is enkomesis: sleeping in a sanctuary. In the Ancient Near East and in Greece, as noted above, incubation almost 14 Mircea Eliade, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy, trans. from the French by Willard R.

Let us consider these in- terlocked—and indispensable—elements one at a time, with attention to the ways in which each creates religious meaning. intentionality By “intentionality,” I mean that the hopeful dreamer sought out inter- action with the god for a specific reason, confusion, or affliction. One typ- ically performed a series of  ritual purifications, including fasting and animal sacrifice—and sometimes weeping—prior to the incubation. Incu- bation without preparation, as a means of  invoking the god and attracting his or her attention, would have been unthinkable—but also impossible. In light of  this, one wonders what kind of  “dreams” the sleep laboratory produces; perhaps it is no surprise they are fragmented, incoherent, or apparently “without meaning” if  they entail no preliminary ritual com- munion with the god of  the place, who is, in the end, a machine.19 Intentional preparation and orientation were mandatory in ancient dream incubation. In 2 Chronicles 1:1–13, for example, Solomon dedicates a thousand burnt offerings upon the bronze altar at the high place at Gib- eon before his ratifying divine dream in which “God appeared to So- lomon and said to him, ‘Ask what I should give you’ ” (2 Chron. 1:7).20 In the Ancient Near Eastern accounts, including the Biblical accounts, one then slept on the skin of  the sacrificed animal, most commonly that of  a sheep, a ram, or a goat. Greek carved stone reliefs of  dream healings from fourth-century b.c.e. Asklepieia frequently show the dreamer asleep on an animal skin that covers the kline (sleeping couch), with the head or legs hanging down. Interestingly, supplicatory weeping is a frequent mode of  preparation for incubation, in texts from Hittite to Egyptian to Canaanite to Israelite, so, as biblical scholar Susan Ackerman notes, “crying may be a ritual re- quired of  those seeking a dream visitation,”21 and “weeping precedes a dream theophany and serves to induce it.”22 She illustrates by way of  the Herodotean account in which the obscure Pharaoh Sethos, “threatened by the Assyrian invasion led by Sennacherib, retreated into the inner sanc- 19 For the clinically based assertion of  the fundamental, global incoherence of  dream nar- ratives, see esp.

Ishtar instructs Naram-Sin to purify himself  and his bed in order to prepare for the incubation (lines 12–13) and also to prepare by “calling out to the gods” (line 13) and “to complain to the goddesses” (line 14).25 He did these things; the incubation was successful, and the deities an- swered. Not all ancient incubations followed “the script”; in addition to the surrogate incubations on behalf  of  another already mentioned above, unintentional incubations are occasionally known in antiquity, such as the one testified to by the so-called Sphinx Stele, which describes the dream visited upon Thutmose IV as he slept between the feet of  the sacred sphinx.26 Most commonly, however, incubation is a process one enters deliberately, intentionally, on one’s own behalf, with an eye to hatching dreams of  power. locality Whereas contemporary thought tends to focus on the sleeping human as dream-maker, the fact is that traditional thought interested itself  in the dream, a supernaturally generated “place-event” where the god or holy teacher could visit: Sufi initiation by the pir often takes place in dreams,27 and Hayyim Vital, the chief  disciple of  Isaac Luria, mourned for a year after the Ari’s death because his beloved teacher did not come to him in his dreams, even though he lay down each night anticipating the contin- uance of  their relationship.28 Furthermore, the “place” that is the dream’s setting is usually radically connected to the place where the dream is dreamed. The concrete, sanc- tified site of  falling asleep (one level of  the ritual experience of  incuba- tion) is the bottom rung of  the ladder, which corresponds to the next rung, 23 Ibid. 24 Herodotus, Histories 2.141, trans.

Classical religious incubation is “all about” sleeping in a partic- ular place, a place set apart; that element of  locality is not negotiable. If I want to be healed by Asklepios, I must bring my wounded body to him at his shrine, and after I have fasted and purified myself  and made special offerings in the walled temple precinct, I must sleep in the abaton, to- gether with other sufferers and under the watchful, scripted mediation of priests, with the shared goal of  receiving a therapeutic dream from the god. The topographical element is paramount: incubation invariably takes place in a prescribed holy place, on the ground or a special cot, where the “membrane” between the mundane and sacred worlds is thin. When in Genesis 28:11 Jacob lies down to sleep “because the sun had set,” it is at a certain place, upon a particular rock, Bet-El, the House of  God, and it is there and only there that he can “watch” the angels ascending and de- scending from heaven. The incubating sleep in the special place is in turn a kind of  preparation of  the soul-space for the epiphany, much in the same way Vedic sacrifice begins with the creation of  soft grass seats for the gods to come down and sit upon the altar. Ancient dream incubation most emphatically could not happen “just anywhere.” We postmoderns may resist this idea at first, for so much of  our sense of  place has been flattened out by global communications, giving the il- lusion of  the world’s highly varied “scapes” as interchangeable backdrops for human enterprise. One summer evening in Central Square in Cam- bridge, Massachusetts, I saw an ad for AT&amp;T wireless phones. It read, “5th Avenue. Utah. Same place.” Behind the print, a beautiful man spoke on a cellular phone in front of  a great red rock formation, perhaps Arches National Monument. The fact is that Fifth Avenue and Utah are not the same place; they each have their own history and their own gods. Although we each surely carry our psychic luggage with us wherever we go, the classical idea of  incubation would dictate that we dream differently at each place we might sleep, in response to the spirit of  that place. The concept of  incubation would also imply that we tend to fare better in our deliberate dreaming at the “strong” place (locality) if  we orient ourselves to the powers of  the place before falling asleep (intentionality), and then tell the truth about the encounter (epiphany) by acknowledging it—even publicizing it—afterward. Incubated dreams did not remain “personal” for long. The place of  sacred sleep in classical incubation is never incidental. Like the omphalos at Delphi, like the great city of  Teotihuacan, like the mountain at Sinai, like the caves of  Chauvet or Dordoigne, places sought for incubation are permeable. They can be natural places where divine power is manifest, which Eliade called kratophanies, or they can be hu- manly constructed, such as the great temple at Orissa or the small stone </page> <page sequence="12"> History of Religions 205 waybil shrines of  the Maya; or they can be a combination of  both, as in places where there has been an architectural or artistic response to an anomaly of  the terrain, something strange or reminiscent that demands attention—something that, to use Australian aboriginal conceptual lan- guage, “pushes.” If  one sleeps in such places, and enters that “other” mode of  conscious- ness, one stands—and expects—a better chance of  encountering the god than when one sleeps elsewhere. This is the logic of  incubation—an in- ternal, ritual logic, but highly resilient and notably similar across reli- gious cultures. The portal of  the place opens the portal of  the dream. Incubation places are god-haunted; they are places with which the god is identified, and so is most likely to be found in sleep; thus incubated dreams are god-sent (theopempti, as Aelius Aristides said). Probably the oldest sacred place in the Mediterranean was the earth it- self. In ancient Greek religion, the earth was a goddess, the home of  the deposed Titans and the dead. The Earth was believed to engender dreams. In Euripides’ Hecuba, the heroine, the wife of  King Priam of  the Trojan War, addresses the earth at line 70, “O potnia Chthon, melanon pterugon meter oneiron” (O Lady Earth, mother of  black-winged dreams).29 Asklep- ios, as a divinized hero, had both Olympiam temple and chthonic tholos shrines at his sanctuaries, and it is clear that although he is the son of Apollo, as a dead hero he is nevertheless a great subterranean force as well. Homer’s ancient priests of  Dodona, the Sel’loi, “with feet un- washed,” sleep without covers directly on the ground in order to maintain their prophetic power and almost certainly to incubate dreams (Iliad 16.235). Hermes is the conductor of  souls as well as the hegetor oneiron. We have already noted that Jacob lies directly upon the earth, with a stone as his pillow, to receive his revelatory dream, and as Ackerman tells it, the Roman kings Latinus and Numa “both lie on the ground to incubate, even though they, as royal personages, could surely command beds.”30 As we shall see, the most common place that the practice of incubation survives in the Abrahamic traditions in the Near East and Northern Africa is at the tombs of  the saints, for the connection between dreams and death there is highly determined, as it is in so many other tra- ditions. For example, in the classical Mayan imagination, as Lawrence Sullivan describes it following the Popul Vuh, “the ‘underworld’ to which the soul is translated after death is the same primordial world-condition visited during the royal dream, vision, and hallucination.”31 29 See the discussion in Angelo Brelich, “The Place of  Dreams in the Religious World Concept of  the Greeks,” in The Dream and Human Societies, ed. G. E. von Grunebaum and Roger Callois (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of  California Press, 1966), p. 299. 30 Ackerman, p. 116. 31 Lawrence Sullivan, personal communication, June 2, 2003. </page> <page sequence="13"> 206 Dream Incubation While it can be a natural place, the site of  classical incubation is most commonly a sanctuary; like the Temple of  Solomon, this place results from a divine directive, a heavenly plan. It cannot be sublimated. In his essay “Astral Dreams in Judaism,” Moshe Idel describes what he calls “oneiric techniques” practiced by medieval kabbalists such as Abraham ibn Ezra and others, whereby through restructuring the letters of  key Bib- lical verses from the Torah, such as Exodus 25:22, in which God prom- ises to speak from between the two keruvim that guarded the ark, one could receive private angelic revelation by going to sleep and dreaming. These are unabashedly theurgic strategies, and phenomenologically they bear little difference from outright magic. Commenting on a pseudo- Maimonidean epistle of  the same genre, Idel rightly distinguishes such techniques from classic incubation in the following way: “The strong God, who presided in the Israelite sanctuary and who revealed himself only in the sacrosanct locus between the keruvim, is now replaced by weaker entities, the angels, who can be induced to go everywhere. . . . It should be stressed that the temple, fixed in place, has been replaced by the extraordinary human experience during the dream. Unlike incubatory experiences well known since ancient times (where the strength of  the locus was crucial for eliciting the divinatory dream), in the kabbalistic epistle, the place basically irrelevant.”32 He continues, “That is why I pre- fer the term ‘oneiric technique’ to ‘incubation,’ a term commonly con- nected to a sacred shrine or sanctuary.”33 In other words, as Idel notes, “incubation is often related not only to fixed places, such as temples, but also to strong gods that preside over these shrines, while the oneiric techniques as represented by the she’elat halom literature are mobile and, while addressing the supreme deity, they involve the reception of  the answers from weaker intermediary powers, such as the angels.”34 If, in the study of  Jewish mystical thought, we ad- here to Idel’s rigorous application of  the term, true incubation only occurs at the house of  a god, and elicits the dream visit of  the god himself; false incubation happens anywhere and only produces those divine wannabes, the angels. epiphany Likewise, it is not surprising that in ancient Greek and ancient Near East- ern thought, dreams come as messages from the gods; the Greek verb used, as Carl Meier points out, is episkopein: “to visit.” The person does not 32 Moshe Idel, “Astral Dreams in Judaism: Twelfth to Fourteenth Centuries,” in Shulman and Stroumsa, eds.

We are as far as possible from the world of  the French expression, “j’ai fait un rêve.”35 Without the god’s appearance (or saint’s, or pir’s, in modern dreams), the incubated dream is not efficacious, for one cannot be sure of  what to do unless one hears it directly from the horse’s mouth. Not an “insight,” not a personal change or new direction, not a “rethink- ing”: a god, who cannot only heal in dreams, but even beget children, or dictate the text of  speeches (Aelius Aristides often wrote kata; ta;Í twÅn ojneiravtwn epipnoÇaÍ, “according to the inspiration of  god-sent dreams”). In the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean, as in most incubating socie- ties, the god can always take theriomorphic form in the solicited dream and be just as powerful as in anthropomorphic form, if  not more so. The Greek healing gods Asklepios and Amphiaraios, for example, routinely took the form of  a great serpent in incubated dreams. Aelius Aristides presents in his Sacred Tales one of  the most striking accounts of  a dream epiphany, and of  the magnetic, tender shock it in- duced in the dreamer. He writes, For there was a seeming, as it were, to touch him and to perceive that he himself had come, and to be between sleep and waking, and to wish to look up and to be in anguish that he might depart too soon, and to strain the ears and to hear some things as in a dream, some as in a waking state. Hair stood straight, and there were tears of  joy, and the pride of  one’s heart was inoffensive. And what man could describe these things in words? If  any man has been initiated, he knows and understands.36 The god’s coming in the sought dream is the fulcrum of  all the ritual ori- entation that has preceded it, and all that will ensue afterward. It is an iconic encounter. It is the goal of  the dream. the rectification of categories Intentionality, locality, epiphany. Understood in its original context, incu- bation turns out to be a rather precisely constructed category. The com- parative study of  religion has come under fire for flattening out differences in religious practice and philosophy through its use of  broad categories to describe apparently universal phenomena. The history of  this practice lies 35 The notion of  dreams as the product of  the dreamer is known elsewhere, as in Indian thought, although in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, the dreamer creates an interior reality from the stuff  of  his outer reality: “there are no ponds, lotus-pools, or flowing streams there; but he emits ponds, lotus-pools, and flowing streams. For he is the Maker” (Brhadaranyaka Upan- isad 4.3.9–10, translated and discussed by Wendy Doniger [O’Flaherty] in Dreams, Illusions, and Other Realities [Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 1984], p. 16). But as Doniger points out, this ontology makes the dreamed world no less real. 36 Aelius Aristides, Sacred Tales 2.32, in Behr, trans. (n. 3 above), p. 230. </page> <page sequence="15"> 208 Dream Incubation in the strong interest in classification inherited from philosophical phe- nomenology. Many of  these terms are Western or monotheistic in their origin; so, for example, as has been elaborately developed in the past de- cades, the idea of  “scripture” might illumine the Vedas but only partially help us to understand the role of  divinatory texts in Taoism or else com- pletely confuse our study of  the Iliad and Odyssey, sung poems that for at least a thousand years were central in ancient Greek religious culture but were not codified until very late in their history, nor used by institu- tionalized hierarchies to undergird an orthodox theology. Recently, comparative study has undergone a kind of  crisis of  self- examination in which it has swung away from the imperialism of  the non- reflective use of  these categories and toward the other extreme, wherein one cannot use a single term to describe analogous or similar phenomena from different religions. Of  course this too is intellectually constrictive, for many religions share observably similar structures—such as concepts of  evil, or priesthood, or relics, or the power of  blood, or twins, or trees— and scholars of  religion need a way to think and speak about such simi- larities without repressing differences. As a middle path, Jonathan Z. Smith has recently suggested a compar- ative process he calls “the rectification of  categories.”37 Smith argues that a category may retain its validity as long as we allow data from cultures outside its origin to continue to influence, to nuance, and to qualify our usage of  that category, rather than indiscriminately shoehorning it into footwear to fit every size. In this spirit, I do not mean to suggest that terms in the history of  re- ligion cannot evolve, nor that they must slavishly reveal their genealogy in every appropriate usage or be jettisoned. Following Smith’s principle of  rectification, I believe that the category of  dream incubation is still use- ful and can still continue to be rectified, as long as we know and respect its highly specific historical context, and appreciate its profoundly cultic meaning. To reiterate, incubation meant deliberate sleeping in a holy place after ritual preparation in order to produce religiously meaningful dreams in which the god showed himself  or herself  in an efficacious way to solve the problem, heal the illness, or give the message. Must it still mean all these things? In my view, we might use the term “incubation” absent one of  the three main elements of  intentionality, lo- cality, or epiphany, but I seriously question whether two can be missing and still allow the term to be meaningful. In other words, if  I sleep non- intentionally in a generic place and a god shows up in my dream, I am 37 See Jonathan Z. Smith, “The ‘End’ of  Comparison: Redescription and Rectification,” in A Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age, ed.

But if  I sleep intentionally in a holy place and a cucumber appears, I am incubating. Especially if  I am sleeping among the Nuer, where cucumbers can sacrificially substitute for sacred cattle. modern examples of “true” or “classical” dream incubation Some modern cases of  ongoing dream incubation practice contain all three of  these original elements, as well as the “aftermath” of  publicly sharing the miracle of  the dream. In India, temple incubations exist in Bengal, and in coastal Orissa, among other places. Interestingly, these often entail origin myths “that included therapeutic temple sleep and visitations by the deity.”38 Although various kinds of  healing constitute the most com- mon goal of  Hindu temple incubations, other miracles can be sought. The dream cure involves an isolation and liberation of  the individual, a cut- ting of  the usual social moorings; this is true of  all pilgrimages, as Victor and Edith Turner have repeatedly shown. Unlike other kinds of  pilgrimage, however, incubation also requires an entry into the place of  the goddess, both topographically and theologically, and a kind of  unfettered intermin- gling of  self  with her purposes. As James Preston sensitively observes, The intriguing element is the incorporation of  the individual into the bosom of  the temple, where he returns to a womb-like environment to be healed, while the deity absorbs the pollution from his disease. The person identifies with the deity. He lives in the temple day and night, performing various tasks, assists the priests when needed, and escapes from the pressures of  caste, village commu- nity, and kin. Through identification with the deity, new life is breathed into the devotee. Thus, the miracle is not only a cure of  body but also a healing of  the torn spirits of  fragile people.39 We have, for example, attestation of  a continuous practice of  incuba- tion at Mahabalipuram in India, at the shrine of  the goddess Parvati, built in a.d. 700. Parvati gives children to barren women. Ania Teillard offers a description from the early 1960s of  an incubation rite by a barren woman at the goddess’s temple with the goal of  conception: Sita Lakshmi . . . was obliged to dedicate herself  entirely to the service of the goddess. . . . She was allowed one meal a day, and a little milk and fruit in the evening. Morning and night, she made the round of  the temple one hundred and eight times, imploring the goddess to hear her and calling her by her innu- merable names. As is customary, to avoid any mistake, at each round she put a 38 James J. Preston, “Cosmic Implosion: Miraculous Experience in Hinduism,” Anima 2, no. 2 (1986): 157. 39 Ibid. </page> <page sequence="17"> 210 Dream Incubation little pebble in a small sack hanging from a tree. This time of  preparation lasted six months. When the sixth month came to an end she was to make the round of  the tem- ple for the last time; she must not walk, but roll around it on the rocky ground. Her parents were obliged to help her for she could not do it alone. At last the decisive moment arrived. Sita Lakshmi was led by the priests into the temple. There, behind the altar, was a stone bench where the suppliant must await in holy sleep the judgement of  the goddess. . . . Lying on the hard bench, she implored the goddess with fervent prayers until the moment of  sleep. Then she had a dream: an aged priest came to her bearing a bronze tray with four coconuts, three large and one small. He offered the tray to her, casting the small coconut onto the ground, where it was broken into pieces. The priests interpreted her dream for her. She was to give birth to four chil- dren, but one of  them would die young.40 Teillard goes on to comment that the interpretation of  Sita Lakshmi’s dream proved to be entirely correct. Note that all the elements of  dream incubation known from the classi- cal world are present in this account: intentionality, including ritual preparation that also entails fasting, physical ordeal, and even weeping as a preparatory communication—in the act of  “complaining to the god- dess”—locality (sleeping in a sanctuary), dream epiphany (the sacerdotal coconuts), and a commentary upon the aftermath of  the incubation in- cluding the veracity of  the dream. In the Orissan temple of  the Mother, where therapeutic temple sleep is called dharana in Oriya, pilgrims travel long distances to the shrine, fast, pray, and expect that as a usual result the deity will visit them in a dream and cure them of  their illness. Preston describes the situation: “At the temple goddess Sarala in rural Orissa, which I studied extensively, there were always two or three people at any time undergoing a dharana cure. Typically the devotee comes to the temple, lies upon a straw mat all day and night, prays, eats only prasad (consecrated food offered to deities), drinks holy water, and bathes three times per day. The ritual is an act of purification and, if  it does not work after three days, it is extended for twenty-one days.”41 40 Ania Teillard, Spiritual Dimensions (La dimension inconnue) (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1961). This type of  incubation in India has a heritage of  many centuries, if  not millennia. Compare the seventh-century Indian account, Kadambari by Banabhatta, in which in order to conceive a son, Queen Vilasavati sleeps in the temples of  the goddess Candika and tells the resulting dreams to Brahmans for interpretation. This account is cited in David N. Lorzen, The Kapalikas and Kalamukhas: Two Lost Saivite Sects, 2d ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1991), pp. 16–17, and discussed in Young (n. 2 above), p. 22, n. 18. 41 Preston, p. 157. SHORT </page> <page sequence="18"> History of Religions 211 Preston’s research also encompassed more extreme cases, calling for more drastic measures such as longer incubations. The results of  these are interesting from both a phenomenological and a theological point of  view: In some cases serious diseases like syphylis, gonorrhea, or leprosy (considered to be ritually, as well as physically polluting), may require the individual to stay at the temple for a thousand days to be cured miraculously. As one man expressed it: “My syphylis was cured completely after a thousand days at the temple. My body is now intermingled with the Mother (the goddess). She is in my body.” The man who reported this was emotionally disturbed and appeared to be pos- sessed by the deity. This kind of  dharana cure is more extreme than most be- cause, instead of  merely dreaming about the goddess, the individual has become possessed by her.42 the consequences of incubation A thousand days! “She is in my body”! Perhaps what is described in neurophysiological literature as “difficulty distinguishing dreams from reality and vice versa”43 in the case of  brain lesions or psychosis might emerge in the semantic field of  incubation as something quite spectacu- lar, an integration of  realms of  knowing that are usually in most individ- uals distinct, even socially construed as at odds with one another. In the Ancient Near East the successful incubation was publicly signi- fied by the making of  a vow, erecting a thank-offering or inscription, or setting up a stone or a painting at the spot of  the efficacious dream. The grateful Hellenistic patient of  Asklepios dedicated ≥atra or sΩstra, thank- offerings, according to his or her wealth. These could take, among other things, the form of  a sacrificed cock (as in Socrates’ final words to Crito), a composed paean, a stele with a dream account, or a sculpted image of the healed part; cases of  god-sent relapse in the event of  tardy payment are known.44 Yet as just reported, the aftermath of  an intense or prolonged in- cubation can be a degree of  possession by or absorption into the deity; after the incubation, if  it produces the desired dream of  the god, one’s life is no longer entirely one’s own. It is as though the prolonged contact through dreams with the holy place, and thus with the god that lives there, has blurred the edges of  the distinct and socially defended personality; the god has infested the dreamer. This is understandably especially true of  healing dreams, and the worse the illness or wound, the truer it is. There can be said to be a kind of  fusion 42 Ibid. 43 M. Morris, D. Bowers, A. Chatterjee, and K. Heilman, “Amnesia following a Discrete Basal Forebrain Lesion,” Brain 115 (1992): 1834. 44 See Meier (n. 8 above), p. 66. </page> <page sequence="19"> 212 Dream Incubation of  the smaller self  with the larger, and this might even be asserted with- out psychoanalytic overtones. That fusion can be forged by gratitude alone, and it is the result of  the invasion of  the personal world of  one’s dreams by the transpersonal godhead. Later these extreme cases might stay at the healing shrine and become permanent fixtures, dream “hangers-on”; in Hellenistic Greek cultures, they were called katochoi, literally, “voluntary prisoners,” such as the no- torious and prolific Aristides, who took up residence at the Asklepieion at Pergamon intermittently for a total of  twelve years. As Preston’s ear- lier observation illumines, this condition is not a mentality that is sepa- rate from that of  a normal seeker of  dreams at a shrine. Rather, it simply represents a more extreme existential condition and behavior on the spec- trum of  incubation; that spectrum inevitably mandates identification with the god who “dreams through” and thus into the sufferer. One belongs to the goddess by dint of  having dreamed her; this is made manifest by those who remain at the incubation shrine instead of  going home. royal incubation Having established the category of  incubation, and seen that even with its classical elements, it is very much alive today, we can now begin to see how it was elaborated in ancient times, and we can trace such themes in modern practice. Royal dreams, whereby “the sacral king . . . was the principal ‘dreamer’ in the land,”45 were especially valuable for their di- vinatory power. Royal dreams were also generative dreams: in the Ther- avadan account, after participating for seven days in the midsummer festival (Asahala) in Kapilavatthu, Queen Maya bathes in scented water, distributes alms, climbs into her royal bed, and incubates a dream that in turn incubates the Buddha. She is transported to a celestial couch beneath a great tree in the Himalayas; there in that mighty place a great white el- ephant bearing a lotus flower in his trunk circumambulates her three times and gently enters her womb on the right side.46 While noting that dream incubation was frequent in medieval Buddhist Japanese shrines (and, we might add, in popular modern Japanese Shinto- ism as well, as in the sacred precinct of  the ritually unpolluted island of Itsuku-shima), Carmen Blacker has suggested the practice plausibly ex- isted in ancient Shinto, particularly at the time of  the imperial succession. In the oldest and most occulted ceremony in “the ritual sequence which marks the consecration of  the Japanese emperor,” the daijosai, which in- 45 Carmen Blacker, “The Shinza or God-Seat in the Daijo-sai—Throne, Bed, or Incuba- tion Couch?” Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 17, nos. 2–3 (1990): 194. 46 Nidana-Katha 1.50, trans. T. W. Rhys Davids from the birth narrative that introduced a version of  the Jatakas, cited in Young (n. 2 above), p. 10 and n. 13. </page> <page sequence="20"> History of Religions 213 cludes such prehistoric features as the absence of  any metal in the ritual building and the emperor’s eating from “rough earthenware vessels and oak-leaf  dishes . . . on which he offers food to the kami,” as well as the wearing of  a celestial feather robe, Blacker argues that the shinza or god- seat, believed to be a throne or a bed within the shrine, may well have been an incubation couch.47 The ceremony is first attested in the reign of the Emperor Tenmu (r. 672–87), although it may well be older. The “hatch- ing” emperor wrapped himself  in a kind of  magical coverlet, reenacting the prized state of  utsobo, “hollowness” to the divine. For the daijosai to have been efficacious, the new emperor must have lain on the shinza, closely shrouded in layers like a cocoon, and hence in darkness: he must, in other words, have gestated the “nascent soul of  his ancestors.”48 Ori- guchi Shinobu suggests that this symbolic process, in the extraordinary rite called ofusama, is deeply imbedded in Japanese culture.49 As Blacker expresses it, “spiritual power, if  it is to grow and mature, needs a period in the darkness of  a sealed vessel.” This is surely reminiscent of  classical incubation with its theme of  the retreat of  the weeping, sleeping king into the darkest, most recessed sanctuary of  the god: stripped of  imperial dis- plays of  power, the ruler must become a kind of  egg to be refertilized by the divinity, which is the source of  his hegemony, the source which alone can maintain it. In the Near East and the Mediterranean, as we have seen, rulers are fre- quent incubators of  dreams; while these dreams can have personal mean- ing, usually they have far wider import. Direction of  communal activities, especially as regards the construction of  sacred sites, the waging of  war, and questions concerning agriculture and disease, are frequent topoi of royal dreams. The king as the god’s representative on earth was obligated to dream on behalf  of  his people; in the case of  the Japanese emperor, as Blacker remarks, “He was the chief  link, through oracular dreams, with the world of  the kami and the supernatural knowledge which lay in their gift. He had only to lie down to a ‘ritual sleep’ for a kami to appear with the answer to a problem that seemed hitherto insoluble. Incubation for the emperor was therefore an important religious duty.”50 In Mesopotamia, royal dreams are usually highly stylized “message dreams” where the deity communicates with the dreamer, who is then enabled to communicate the god’s will to his people. The dreams of Pharaoh in the Joseph stories in Genesis (Gen. 41:25–36) are, as Benja- min Kilborne calls them, “symbolic dreams,” which spell out the future and 47 Blacker, pp. 179, 190. 48 Ibid., p. 191. 49 Origuchi Shinobu, “Reikon no hanashi” (On the soul in spirits), in Origuchi Shinobu zenshu (Tokyo: Chuo Koronsha, 1950), 3:260–74. 50 Blacker, p. 194. </page> <page sequence="21"> 214 Dream Incubation which can be interpreted by a “religious man in touch with the deity.”51 As a seer in touch with the god who originated the dreams, Joseph can interpret Pharaoh’s cryptic dreams; the twin dreams, though symbolically plotted, of  seven years of  plenty being devoured by seven years of  fam- ine, are warnings for the people that only Pharaoh can originate. The relationship between royalty and ritual dreaming emerges as even more complex in the past and present tradition of  the Maya, with the addition of  the enlivened, swirling realm of  death. In Momostenango, a town in the Guatemalan highlands, the K’iche’ people maintain lineage shrines, called cofrodía shrines—small stone monuments in the shape of boxes, stone effigies of  houses. Here the ordinarily imprisoned souls of the dead can cluster on special days to commune with their relatives and to be propitiated by them.52 Pregnant women are presented before the shrines so that “lineage priest-shamans can ‘sow or plant’ the soul of  the new family member into her womb from the pool of  ancestral souls.”53 These humanly built shrines are often near special spots in the natural world, springs or mountaintops, and they represent a direct material con- tinuity with the ancient Maya, as Linda Schele argues in Maya Cosmos. In the K’iche’ language, which has its roots in classical Mayan, the word for such a shrine is warabal ja, literally “sleeping house.” The modern term is derived from the glyph waybil.54 Waybil can refer to a number of important sanctuaries, including the Temple of  the Inscriptions at Tikal. “U Waybil ch’ul is the name of  a class of  little stone houses” excavated near a small L-shaped building on a terrace excavated in 1991 in the clas- sical city of  Copan in the Yucatan. U waybil ch’ul means “the sleeping 51 Kilborne (n. 4 above), p. 177. 52 Linda Schele, in David Fredel, Linda Schele, and Joy Parker, Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman’s Path (New York: William Morrow, 1993), pp. 188–89. 53 Ibid., p. 188. Schele remarks, “The idea of  souls waiting in such a locality might well strike us as something akin to Purgatory in Christianity. . . . [elsewhere in Maya Cosmos] we are given an example of  Maya people dancing to temporarily release the souls of  their ances- tors from such a place, which they liken in that context to a jail. At the time of  the Conquest, many Maya regarded the afterlife as an unpleasant sojourn in a dark, damp place like a cave.” 54 Schele elaborates, “Waybil is the participle of  way, ‘to sleep.’ A house called a waybil is a sleeping place just as warabal is ‘sleeping’ in K’iche’. Since way also means ‘transfor- mation,’ a waybil can be a dormitory or a bedroom—but it can also be a place where one dreams and transforms into the soul companion” (ibid., p. 188, n. 30). Nikolai Grube and Linda Schele built on the 1989 research of  Stephen Houston and David Stuart on “the glyphic usage of  waybil as ‘sleeping place or article’ . . . where the wayob manifested” by highlight- ing the “explicit use of  this term in reference to lineage and cofrodía shrines in modern K’iche’ communities” (ibid.). In other words, the classical Maya dream incubation sites, waybil, the places of  traffic with the world of  spirits, may well have been lineage shrines that represent the repository for ancestral souls; hence the spiritual realms of  sleep and death, and the invocation of  their denizens through dream incubation, would have been closely knit in the Mayan thought-world, and this may well have continued up to the present day. SHORT </page> <page sequence="22"> History of Religions 215 (or dreaming) place of  god.” In Yukatek, tzak means “to conjure” or “to conjure clouds.” The building portrayed ancestor cartouches “surrounded by S-shaped cloud scrolls,” either clouds in the sky or clouds of  incense smoke, “floating in the reliefs over the images of  the waybil in which the ancestors of  Copan’s royal house were conjured.”55 At Palenque, an ancient tablet refers to the replacement of  the soul of a ritual dancer (dressed as the animal companion, the way, of  a deceased king) by that very king after he has “entered into his dreaming-place,” the lineage shrine or waybil. The glyph “way,” deciphered as “companion animal spirit” by Nikolai Grube and David Stuart, derives from the words “to sleep” and “to dream.” Wayob, the animal companion spirits of  royals, often are shown dancing in the shape of  human beings floating in the air. Thus the shrine home of  the dead, of  the ancestral spirit, is called “the sleeping (or dreaming) house of  the god.” The waybil ch’ul of  the past and the warabal ja of  the present are places on earth where the divinized dead can dream and can reach the living. The divine ancestral spirit sleeps and dreams at these particular places, and the living dreamer at the same places can have access to the same spirit. This conflation of  ideas around the three themes we have identified—intentionality, locality, and epiph- any—would then be centuries old among the K’iche’. An informant at Momostenango told Garrett Cook, “This then is what I believe. It is as we say when we dream of  someone who had died. We have known him and we have a dream. Then we say that the spirit comes down visibly to our spirits in this way when we sleep, and so the two spirits converse, the living and the dead.”56 the theology of incubation: monotheistic tensions One of  the most interesting ways to study incubation is to chart its his- tory once monotheistic “ethical” theologies supersede polytheistic “the- urgic” ones in the Near East and the Mediterranean. Sanctified sleeping not only persists but is correspondingly excoriated by religious purists; this begins as early as the Hebrew prophets. There are two main reasons for this, which are interrelated. The first is that Abrahamic monotheism, beginning with ancient Judaism, always sought radically to distinguish it- self  from its pagan neighbors by condemning their practices. The warning is always sharp and clear, drawing its rhetorical strength from obviously 55 Ibid., p. 190. 56 Garrett Cook, “Quichean Folk Theology and Southern Mayan Supernaturalism,” in Symbol and Meaning beyond the Closed Corporate Community: Essays in Mesoamerican Ideas, ed.

The Sumerians believe that their gods literally eat their sacri- fices; Israelites should not. Contiguous peoples worship deities in the form of  images; Israelites should not.” The practice of  dream incubation was equally suspect, but like all of  the practices just mentioned, it continued to be practiced by the Israelites, by the early Christians, as well as in the Islamic world. This has created tension between orthodox authority and popular practice, which we see reflected in sources from ancient to mod- ern times. As we have said, incubation was at its root a form of  oneiromancy, a way of  divination through dreams. It was also, apparently, a form of  the- urgy, of  cajoling or ritualistically compelling the god to appear, grant an audience to the dreamer, and do what gods do: diagnose, heal, predict. Furthermore, incubation was and remains profoundly dependent upon the “spirit of  place.” In other words, the theology of  incubation highly local- izes the god, limiting his ability to affect human beings through dreams to special, often cultically identified, places. Finally, dream incubation offers revelation in a democratic, plurally disseminated form that is very difficult to validate or to control through religious authority. Monotheistic self-representation naturally resists and seeks to control these theological aspects of  incubation. Yet such resistance was histori- cally difficult to uphold by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim writers wish- ing to separate themselves from such premonotheistic practice, not only because incubation was such an established practice in the Near East, but also because authoritative dreams do in fact figure in all three traditions. The omnipotent God sends “big” dreams: in the Hebrew Bible, the dream of  Jacob at Bet-El, Joseph’s dreams, and those of  Pharaoh and Solomon and other kings and prophets. In the New Testament, one encounters the dreams of  Joseph concerning Mary’s conception of  Jesus by the Holy Spirit; his dream telling him to flee with her and their infant son to Egypt; the dream of  the three wise men to “go home by another way.” In Islam, the mi‘raj nameh, the “night-journey” of  the Prophet to the sev- enth heaven to converse with God, has been understood by Shi‘i and Sufi interpreters as a dream, although Sunni tradition makes it a literal jour- ney. Muhammad undergoes internal cleansing by the angel Jibril in the waters of  Zamzam, travels on the back of  al-Buraq to Jerusalem, leads prayer at the Silver Mosque, and ascends from the Rock, as-Sakhra, en- shrined in the Dome of  the Rock upon the Temple Mount. He returns be- fore the water has finished pouring out of  the glass by his bedside that he had knocked over in his haste to arise before the angel. Thus the parameters and “machinery” of  such narrated dreams had to be carefully defined by monotheistic authors.

He cannot be manip- ulated in the magicoreligious sense. As we shall see, classical incubation with all of  its components is not only apparently suppressed in the He- brew Bible, but is also problematized at ancient Christian churches and Muslim shrines despite its practice at these places and continuation to this day. Later I will suggest that there might be a middle path through the strict polarity of  these two theological interpretations of  incubation: (1) ritually “conjuring the god in sleep” as though on demand, and (2) insisting that God (or the gods) cannot be dreamed about at particular places because of  divine illimitability, that is, that the god only appears in dreams by his own volition. That path goes by the way of  mutual dreaming. survivals of incubation in monotheism The Greek notion of  physical healing through cultic dreaming flourished in the shrines of  Asklepios and Hygeia in the fifth century b.c.e.; reach- ing the height of  its popularity in the Hellenistic period, the practice continued in the Eastern Church in Cyprus and Constantinople, survived up until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Italy and Australia, and is apparently widely practiced to this day in modern Greece at the Cathedral at Tinos and elsewhere.57 In Late Antique Coptic Egypt, one finds Christian dream cures at the tomb-shrines of  saints. In the West, St. Gregory of  Tours, writing in the fifth century c.e., tells of  incubations in the Church of  St. Martin of  Tours by the saint’s burial place, and dream cures at the tomb of  Saint-Julien de Briourde in France. Shi‘i and Sufi Islam have a rich history of  incubation, initiation, and transmission of  knowledge through dreams; all of  these are part of  the larger category of  istikhara, as Toufic Fahd has shown.58 Incubation sites abound at the tombs of  marabouts throughout Lebanon and North Africa, particularly in Morocco, where dream interpretation manuals can be pur- chased everywhere telling the Muslim how to distinguish between ruya (God-sent dreams) and a ̇lam (deceitful dreams from other sources). Pe- titioners come to sleep at these tombs and dream dreams of  the saints, the 57 For example, in August 2002, Nun Aemiliane of  the Monastery of  the Elevation of  the Holy Cross in Thebes, Greece, reported to my husband, Bruce Beck, an account of  the mi- raculous dream-healing of  severe gangrene suffered by the grandfather of  a fellow monastic of  her order, Nun Mariam, a number of  years ago. The man slept in a special place within the sanctuary of  the Church of  the Holy Unmercenaries Ss. Cosmos and Damian (soldier-doctors from the period of  Roman persecution) in Trikala, about twenty minutes from Meteora in northern Greece, and was healed by them in a dream. Sr. Mariam’s grandfather visited the church, which was not his own parish, on foot every Sunday for the rest of  his life to express his gratitude to the saints. 58 Toufic Fahd, s.v. “istikhara,” in The Encyclopaedia of Islam (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1978), 4:259–60. </page> <page sequence="25"> 218 Dream Incubation friends of  God (awliya’ allah), who have special intercessory powers for those on earth.59 what is at stake? There is more to this antipathy and tension than the monotheistic insis- tence on a kind of  differentiation from its predecessors. Resistance is not only about unique identity and religious aesthetics. There are high theo- logical stakes concerning the very nature of  God in the incubation con- troversy. The monotheistic God, the God of  Abraham and Sarah, of  Jacob and Rachel, or the God of  Joseph and Mary and Jesus of  Nazareth, or the God of  Muhammad and Aisha and Fa†ima, is a God who because of  his omnipotence and omniscience can be cultically worshipped and even sup- plicated, but ought not to be cultically manipulated; the healing or the knowledge of  the future will be given if  God wills it, but not because one made him produce it in a dream. The ancient practice of  incubation fell uncomfortably into the category of  theurgy, of  compelling the god to attend, to appear, to respond. As the book of  Job makes clear, God be- haves as he pleases vis-à-vis humanity, constrained only by covenants which he himself  creates and enters freely, by self-incarnation, or by self- revelation. The orthodox monotheist does not wish to imagine a god who can be compelled to give a dream because one has slept in a particular place. But incubation is indisputably present in monotheistic scripture nonethe- less, and it is powerfully present to this day in practice, especially in non- industrialized nations. Sometimes in monotheistic scripture and written histories the ritual elements of  the phenomenon are obscured or “weak- ened” in the story to avoid the appearance of  magic. Sometimes there is outright suppression. The Genesis 28 account of  Jacob’s dream may represent such a sup- pression, wherein Jacob seems by chance to produce a mighty vision in one of  the most famous dream accounts in biblical dream literature. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of  the stones of  the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of  God were ascending and descending on it. And the Lord stood beside him, and said, “I am the Lord, the God of  Abra- ham your father and the God of  Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your offspring. . . . Know that I am with you and will keep you wher- ever you go, and will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, 59 See, among others, the work of  Sara Sviri, Benjamin Kilborne, and Toufic Fahd. </page> <page sequence="26"> History of Religions 219 “Surely the Lord is in this place—and I did not know it!” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate to heaven!” (Gen. 28:11–17) Notice that the biblical writer is careful to say that Jacob lays down to sleep at what will become Bethel, the house of  God, only because the sun had set, not because the place is a holy place that can produce dreams. Ackerman has elegantly suggested that elements of  classic incubation are present from start to finish in the Jacob’s latter account, albeit suppressed and even rearranged. “At some juncture in its transmission history,” she ar- gues, “the original cultic context of  Gen. 28.10–22 was obscured in favor of  narrative requirements. Once this happened, ritual elements properly belonging to the incubation rite were freed from their original construct. In particular, the untasted sacrifice and the skins, no longer bound by cul- tic constraints, were able to move elsewhere in the epic.”60 One might go even further than Ackerman does, however: theological concerns, not merely narrative constraints, may be the driving force of the occultation here; similarly, in the account of  Solomon’s incubation in 2 Chron. 1:7 there is no mention of  an induced dream, but rather we find the language of  epiphany by night: “God appeared to Solomon and said to him, ‘Ask what I should give you.’ ” In thanksgiving for the revelation, Joseph then sets up the stone upon which he slept as a massebâ and anoints it (Gen. 28:18: “So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of  it”). As Ackerman notes, “That is, Jacob offers a libation of  oil as a sacrifice.”61 We have al- ready noted the many parallels to this practice of  making a thank-offering in both the Greek and the ancient Near Eastern incubation accounts. After the divine dream, one sets up a stone or stone stele; as is customary, Jacob here anoints the dream-marker.62 In the Christian case, incubated dreams as new or alternative sources of revelation, unsanctioned and without scriptural authority, seemed to have become gradually perceived as threatening to established structures of orthodox interpretation. A manuscript from Coptic Egypt of  the fourth to 60 Ackerman, “The Sacrifice of  Isaac,” pp. 118–19 passim. 61 Ibid., p. 116. 62 See Ackerman (n. 21 above), pp. 116–17. Among the evidence she presents: In 1 Kings 3.15, Solomon, after his incubation at Gibeon, returns to Jerusalem and offers burnt and peace offerings; in Canaanite literature, the king Dan’il in the legend of  Aqhat (CTA 17.2.24– 38) offers food and drink to the Kotharot, the birth-goddesses “who had arrived at the court to oversee the conception of  the child promised to the king in his dream”; King Kirta, like Dan’il, is promised a child in his dream, and offers sacrifice immediately upon awakening (CTA 14.3.154–14.4.171). </page> <page sequence="27"> 220 Dream Incubation fifth centuries c.e., The Miracles of Cyrus and John, now at Duke Uni- versity, warns, “Scripture [i.e., and only Scripture] is the judge of  the dream.”63 As Guy Stroumsa cogently remarks, For a Christian dream to be religiously significant, it must come from God. But since God usually reveals himself  in the Canon of  Scripture, now closed, a true Christian dream must remain something of  an exception. Christian suspicions about dreams were enhanced by the very nature of  Christian monotheism. . . . monotheism entails a single legitimate religious authority. The idea of  a single God as well as that of  a single bishop implies a single legitimate source of truth and thus militates against the plurality of  valid dreams. The drastic limita- tion of  valid dreams was also a result of  the notion of  divine transcendence (and of  the world as God’s creation), a notion that impedes easy passage be- tween the world of  humans and the divine realm.64 At the Sunni-controlled shrines of  Medina, the same issues identified by Stroumsa in ancient Christianity are still at play. For example, prayer at the tomb of  the Prophet is strictly curtailed to prayer that is directed only to Allah himself; hajjis may not pray to the Prophet for intercessory help, nor may they sleep there and dream dreams of  the Prophet. Although the Prophet is “a mercy to the world” and “the last seal of  the prophets,” he is still in orthodox Islamic theology the vessel that received the reve- lation of  the Qur’an, and is not himself, even after death, an appropriate locus of  devotion. As we have said, the mi‘raj is understood in Sunni Islam to be a literal, physical journal to heaven, not a dream; the Sufi claim that Muhammad only dreamed the ascent is seen as degrading the truth of  the theophany and divine instruction he alone witnessed. a proposed phenomenology of dream incubation Robert Bosnak, who led a modern dream incubation in the summer of  2002 in the Paleolithic caves of  France, poses the question, “Can the spirit of place affect dreaming?” The experience of  deliberate sleeping within the deep recesses of  the caves, which produced, as he rightly noted, “differ- ent musings—and different dreams—than those of  Times Square,” causes a kind of  psychic occupation, he argues, by that energetic entity. “After a while,” he said, “our heart beats with the spirit of  the place.” If  the cave paintings are “a self-confession of  the spirit of  the bison by way of  the spirit of  the painter,” then the same might be said of  the incubation pro- cess. Bosnak wonders whether “the charged environment is dreaming 63 L. S. B.

(n. 7 above), pp. 195–96. </page> <page sequence="28"> History of Religions 221 us.”65 Thus the cave-bull, a numinous being, dreams itself  though the in- cubating sleeper, who has created in her intentional sleep a place for it to once more manifest itself, perhaps after thousands of  years of  dormancy. Perhaps the most holistic notion of  intentional dreaming in both phys- ical and metaphysical worlds can be found in the aboriginal “Dreaming” of  Australia: Alcheringa in Aranda, Bugari in LaGrange, Tjukurrpa in the western desert, and Wirrimanu in far northwestern Australia. T. G. H. Strehlow, a lifelong anthropologist of  central Australian aboriginal re- ligion, has noted that someone’s Dreaming is located, and totem expe- rience determined, in the place where the mother experiences her first symptoms of  pregnancy; in that place she often dreams of  the child’s to- tem. A central question in aboriginal culture is, “What is your Dream- ing?” According to Judith Ryan, “An Aborigine might call the place from where his or her Spirit came as Dreaming, or refer to his totem as his Dreaming. The Dreaming also explains the existence of  a social or moral imperative.”66 This link, deeply religious, is also deeply topographical. W. E. H. Stanner reports that one might typically say of  a tree, rocky out- crop, or a pool, “There is my Dreaming. My father showed me this place when I was a little boy. His father showed him. He said, ‘Your dream- ing is there; you want to look after this place; you don’t want to let it go [forget, be careless about it] it is from the first man [the Dreamtime heroes].’ ”67 The Australian aboriginal interpretation of  the incubation process might address the theological concerns of  the monotheistic canon, and get us closer to understanding what takes place during incubation. Incubation is not best understood as theurgy in its most magical sense of  performing ritual steps that compel and harness the limitless deity, that make the god “hatch dreams” in and for us. It is rather a type of  communion, a recip- rocal activity that is closer to prayer or to sacrifice, with intention and 65 Robert Bosnak, “Cultures of  Dreaming” (presidential address, Nineteenth International Conference of  the Association for the Study of  Dreams, Tufts University, Medford, Mass., June 15, 2002). 66 Judith Ryan, “Aboriginal Art Text,” in Rosemary Crumlin, Images of Religion in Aborig- inal Art (Kensington, NSW: Bay Books, 1988). 67 W.

Berndt (Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1969), p. 231. Pace the objections of  Lévi-Strauss a few years earlier, Stanner remarks in the same essay that a totemism is “always a mystical connection, expressed by symbolic devices and maintained by rules, between living persons, whether as individuals or as groups or as stocks and other existents—their ‘totems’ within an ontology of  life that in Aboriginal understanding depends for order and continuity on main- taining the identities and associations which exemplify the connection.” On p. 229 he says, “A totem is an abstract symbol for the possible membership, over all space and time, of the sets of people symbolized by it—the dead, the living, the unborn.” The totem, and its relation- ship to the person, are actually brought about by Dreaming as primordial cosmogonic activ- ity, by dreaming as contemporary activity, and as place (locality) expressed through both. </page> <page sequence="29"> 222 Dream Incubation attention on both sides. One might answer monotheistic objections by asserting that it is not wrong deliberately to seek such divinely induced dreams if  we can preserve in the quest the uncircumscribed power of  the god. It is true that in classical (and classic) dream incubation, given all his individual psychic history as backdrop, the human being offers up a stage for holy dreams. He “dreams” of  the god—he “produces” another world in the same way that the Upanisadic dreamer produces the lotus pools. But is the god less real for that, or less powerful? It is just as possible that at the same time, the goddess is dreaming herself  through the dreamer. By intentionally placing one’s sleeping, purified body at the portal, the “strong” place of  incubation where the heartbeat of  the world can be de- tected, one gives the divine the opportunity to dream itself, to realize it- self, to synthesize and actualize all that it is. “After a while our hearts beat with the spirit of  a place”—and after a while, that spirit of  place may dream itself  through our idiosyncratic night journeys. The highly re- ligiously determined place of  incubation may provide an opening—or an outlet—where, through dreams, the divine, das Heilige, can realize itself more transparently, just as Visnu, sleeping as he floats upon the infinite ocean, dreams the cosmos into existence. Although incubated dreams certainly do not “belong” to human beings any more than any other dreams do, they are far from impersonal. For our part, we are far from passive receptacles for the self-expression of  the gods through dreaming. We contribute to the incubation a delicate yet power- ful web of  experience, memory, will, fear, awe, and desire where the di- vine dream can take place. When the spirit of  place hatches dreams through mortals, it also dreams about us and for us as individuals, as a tribe, and as a race. Thus the process of  incubation, viewed through this phenomenology— or constructive historical theology—emerges neither as conjuring magic (whereby the dreamer is all powerful) nor as a kind of  slavery to the night terrors sent by a celestial despot (whereby the visiting dreamed god is all powerful), but instead as a delicate relationship, as paradoxical and sym- biotic as any other two-sided affair. For millennia, human beings have sought the gods by sleeping in special places. The gods have freely re- sponded as they chose by sending dreams whose purposes range from beneficial healing to dire warning.68 68 It will be obvious to the reader that this proposed phenomenology works without apol- ogy from the premise that the powers that animate incubated dreams may be objectively real, however culturally determined, until proven otherwise. The grounds for the philosophical validity of  this method versus, or at least in rapprochement with, an approach that assumes de facto and without question that all religious experience is socially or psychologically gen- erated, are laid out in my essay, “Juggling Torches: Why We Still Need Comparative Religion,” </page> <page sequence="30"> History of Religions 223 Mutual dreaming is not a new idea. As Wendy Doniger has remarked, it is an idea that is certainly as old as Chuang Tzu’s famous dream of  the butterfly. She reminds us that it appears in countless medieval Hindu tales, and in Alice in Wonderland (in Alice’s dream of  the Red King), and in the work of  Miguel de Unamuno: “I say that we are a dream of  God. God is dreaming us and woe to that day when he awakes! God is dreaming. It is better not to think of  that, but continue to dream that God is dreaming.”69 In a neo-Kantian intellectual world where religious and psychic expe- rience of  any type is seen as a readily decoded human construct rather than as a response to metaphysical reality, it may be necessary to empha- size the divine role in historical and contemporary dream incubation. This too might be a kind of  “rectification of  the category.” The telling of  both sides is imperative: gods and human beings are the cocreators of  dreams in the darkness of  our mutual sleep. Incubated dreams around the world spread new wings in the heat and light of  this encounter. Harvard Divinity School in A Magic Still Dwells, ed.
