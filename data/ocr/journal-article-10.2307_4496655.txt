<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recreating Hopewell. Douglas K. Charles and Jane E. Buikstra, eds. Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 2006. 657 pp. CHARLES COBB State University of New York at Binghamton Among the recent spate of Hopewell publications, this one may best fit the bill as heir-apparent to the land- mark Hopewell Archaeology: The Chillicothe Conference (Brose and Greber 1979) by virtue of its geographical and topi- cal balance. Recreating Hopewell is presented in three major sections-Hopewell in Ohio, Hopewell-Middle Woodland outside Ohio, and New Approaches to Hopewell Material Culture-followed by a concluding section with overview articles by Bruce Smith and Robert Chapman. The sheer length of the book and number of chapters (28) add up to an impressive corpus of new data and interpretations that emphasizes that Hopewellian studies are in a period of fer- ment. That a volume can provide three chapters on distinct variants of Hopewell in southwestern Michigan alone is tes- tament to how far empirical research has advanced. Despite all this, it probably will not surprise that some issues will not go away. The beginning chapters introduce the run- ning debates over the nature of the settlement systems that supported the major earthwork centers in southern Ohio, beginning with Paul Pacheco and William Dancey's well- known dispersed sedentary model advocating long-term habitations, and followed by various naysayers (e.g., Frank Cowan, Richard Yerkes), promoting variants of seasonal mo- bility. For what it is worth, the conundrum of major earth- works being erected by modest numbers of at least semi- mobile groups is not confined to southern Ohio, and it is surprising that Hopewellian archaeologists are not compar- ing notes more with colleagues in, say, the Lower Mississippi Valley where Poverty Point and Coles Creek mound com- plexes represent similar long-standing questions. Earthworks are more than just the culmination of labor, of course, and this book displays a wide array of approaches toward landscape. N'omi Greber's excellent overview of en- closures in Ohio is the perfect entree or refresher, depend- ing on your familiarity with these impressive mound sites. Some of the studies border on the experiential, including Mark Seeman and James Branch's focus on the importance of place and history in the location of earthworks, Bradley Lepper's hypothesis that the Great Hopewell Road (perhaps 90 km long and 6 m wide) linked pilgrimage centers, and Ted Sunderhaus and Jack Blosser's idea that water features at the Fort Ancient site were metaphors for the Lower World</page><page sequence="2">370 American Anthropologist * Vol. 109, No. 2 * June 2007 of the Native American cosmos. These and similar chapters emphasize the point made by the discussant, Chapman, that while North American archaeologists seem loathe to draw on phenomenology, they still employ cultural expla- nations more frequently than previous generations. I would add that Americanists seem most comfortable with cultural interpretations inspired by Native American ethnographies. This sort of generic, direct-historical approach that pulls widely from Plains and Eastern Woodlands accounts carries its own interpretive baggage and should bear more careful scrutiny than typically seen in the studies in this volume. Lepper is one of the few to sound a cautious note about the problematic aspects of analogy. Aside from earthworks, the term Hopewell evokes exotic objects and there are plenty of first-rate studies of material culture in this volume. Two chapters serve as useful illus- trations of the extremes in analytical perspectives. Richard Hughes's geochemical update on the origins of the obsid- ian imported throughout the midcontinent clearly makes the case that there was at least one additional major source (in Idaho) in addition to the well-known Yellowstone one. While this may undermine James Griffin's well-known "one shot" hypothesis (that all of the Hopewell obsidian could have been brought to Ohio in one major trading expedi- tion), it does not rule out a two-shot scenario. Robert Hall's more interpretive study of a well-known copper cutout un- derscores the ambiguities of anthropomorphic and zoomor- phic depictions in Hopewell artworks, and the multiple meanings embedded in them. His identification of a pos- sible caiman in this and another piece is a tantalizing (if less than completely convincing) hint of connections far down the Gulf Coast. The sociopolitical implications of Hopewellian exot- ica also receive their due emphasis. As Chapman observes, we are still a long way from determining how local prac- tices fostered panregional patterning as manifested by the Hopewell interaction sphere. Nevertheless, powerful chiefs qua trade middlemen have now largely been supplanted by shamanic specialists (James Brown) and alternative forms of leadership in Middle Woodland models. Scholars are ob- viously still trying to reconcile the nature of power that can account for such grandiose earthworks, extensive exchange networks, and abundance of exquisitely crafted items. At the very least, however, there does seem to be a growing consensus that positions of authority were vested more with ritual and symbolic qualities, with only tenuous reins on outright domination, rather like department chairs. In the "plus ga change" category, several chapters in- voke migration as a major reason for the appearance of Mid- dle Woodland traits. Yet the sense one gets from these read- ings is that population movement was a contingent process, not an overarching explanation. Migration apparently took place in some regions whereas in-situ developments linked to exchange occurred elsewhere. This provides a healthy balance to the complexity of interactions that likely con- stituted what we recognize as the Hopewell phenomenon. Nevertheless, detailed methodological studies by the likes of James Stoltman (ceramics) and Julie Zimmerman Holt (fau- nal remains) emphasize that precise stratigraphic research, taphonomic studies, and related work remain a cornerstone of addressing these larger questions. In his overview, Smith rightly stresses that a variety of baseline issues, ranging from chronology to artifact typologies, continue to hamper com- parisons between sites. It cannot be said that Recreating Hopewell is a tightly focused, thematic volume, nor did the editors have that in- tent. Instead, this is a wide-ranging collection of geographic regions, methodological approaches, and theoretical per- spectives. Like the Chillicothe volume before it, I suspect we will come to view the book as a horizon marker for state- of-the-art research for years to come. REFERENCE CITED Brose, D. S., and N. B.
