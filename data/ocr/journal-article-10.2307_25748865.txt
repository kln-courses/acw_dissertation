<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Phytogeny of the Human Foot; the Testi mony presented by the Configuration of the Friction Ridges. Harris Hawthorne Wilder. The recent appearance, independently and in different continents, of two papers on the phylogeny of the human foot, especially since they lead to quite different conclusions, have given me the desire to submit the question to the court of appeal presented by the configuration of the friction-ridges, and compare these markings that cover the sole of man with those of their relatives, near and more remote. One of the two papers above mentioned comes from the pen of Dr. Franz Weidenreich of the university of StraBburg, and was published in Schwalbes Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie, Bd. XXII under the title, Der MenschenfuB. A translation of a part of this is in a recent number of the American Journal of Physical Anthro pology, and is thus far the only one I have yet seen. The author does not find any close relationship between the human foot and those of the modern living Anthropoids, but definitely states that ,,the compa rative anatomical study of the foot reveals features which at times resemble those of the Anthropomorph type, at other times more those of the Cercopithecidae .... that the Hominidae must have formed very early an independent branch of primates, which must have passed by itself through Anthropomorph stage, without, however, having stood in closer relation to the recent anthropoid apes." He then states that in the structure of the foot ,,man resembles most closely the Chimpanzee". The other recent paper, by Dr. D. J. Morton, an orthopedic surgeon in New York, who, as he says at the beginning focuses the problem ?upon the somewhat conflicting views of Professor Gregory, who would derive the human foot from one of a gorilloid type", and the opinion of Mr. Gerritt S. Miller, Jr., of the United States National Museum to the effect that ?the distinctly human line branches off from the generalized primate stock at a point near that at which the line leading to the gorilla and chimpanzee originated, and at a time when the great toe had not lost its simple, divergent character".</page><page sequence="2">112 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. This author sees the cause of the variation towards the human form appearing ?to result from terrestrial use in the feet of the gorilla", the conclusion of Gregory rather than that of Miller, in deriving the foot of man from a gorilloid ancestor. ,,In regard to the characteristics of the early human foot, if all the evidence has been correctly studied, they must certainly have been of a generalized gorilloid type, with the grasp ing element well developed." As a prelude to attacking this problem from the standpoint of the configuration of the friction-ridges, one must go back to the 1904 paper of MiB Inez L. Whipple (Mrs. H. H. Wilder) which was published in Schwalbe's Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie, the same magazine that originally published Dr. Weidenreich's article. In her final conclusions MiB Whipple definitely states that ?In the line of development" leading to the Prosimians there occurred very early an almost complete substitution of the prehensile for the walking function, prehension being accomplished through the extreme opposability of the first digit. That in the line of development leading to Primates the early acquirement of prehensile power was accompanied by a reten tion of the walking function .... that in the line of development leading to the Anthropoids and man, the increased weight of the body involved an adaptation to the power to grasp larger limbs, a condition accom panied by the loss of the walking function especially of the anterior chiridium .... that the ancestral line of man diverged from that of the other Anthropoids before the reduction of the interdigital pads of the foot had been accomplished. This divergence was characterized by the early assumption of an erect position, and led to the following modi fications of the foot: (1) a shortening of the digits, (2) a loss of oppo sability of the hallux, (3) a fusion of the interdigital pads, especially the last three, (4) a reduction of the proximal pads, and (5) an extensive proximal development of the plantar surface, with a secondary pad formation over the os calcis, often designated by a secondary ridge pattern." In the body of the work Miss Whipple traces the human ancestry from Lemurs, through such forms as Midas and Lagothrix, in which the tendency is becoming more and more evident of the sprea ding of palms and soles, and that early among such lower monkeys, in which the entire palmar and plantar surfaces become wholly ridged, there may be supposed to have appeared a line of erect, walking forms, which led directly to man, avoiding the large Anthropoids of the present day. Considerable stress is given to the proximo-distal extension of the heel, involving the formation of an extensive calcar area, covering the heel, ,,often designated by a secondary ridge pattern". This is the ?Calcar pattern" of Mrs. Wilder and myself, probably the same as that figured</page><page sequence="3">The Phylogeny of the Human Foot. 113 by her in her Fig. 37, in the feet of two specimens of Cebus, perhaps near the place where branched off the line leading to man. Naturally the first attack upon this problem, the inquiry into the characteristic configuration of the friction ridges in man, and their relationship to those of the nearest related apes, would be the exami nation of a number of individual human feet to see what general form of configuration we have to deal with. After the analogy of the hand we may expect, and rightly, at the bases or each of the four lesser toes Fig. 4. Fig. 5. Fig. 6. a digital triradius, and from each of these a line running across the sole. By the location of these four triradii, and the drawing of the lines procee ding from them, the sole, or at least, the more distal part, corresponding to the area in contact with the ground, may be divided into four inter digital areas, corresponding, not to the digits, but to the inter vals between them. In lower pentadactylous mammals we find the same number of interdigital walking pads, similarly placed, and in monkeys the location of the former pads is represented by concentric whorls. Thus we would expect, in a very primitive human sole, four whorls crossing the ball of the foot, and the first four prints of this collection nearly realise this (fig. 1?4). In all, the first of the four pattern areas, beneath the wide interval between the first and second toes, and called Zeitschrift fur Morphologie und Anthropologie. Bd. XXIV. 8</page><page sequence="4">114 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. the jHallucal" or ,,Ball" pattern, realizes this expectation and shows only whorls. The second area shows a whorl in Fig. 1, but in Figs. 2 and 3 the whorl is reduced to a rather narrow loop, while in Fig. 4 this area is blank, without a trace of a pattern. The third and fourth inter digital areas in all four soles show loops instead of complete whorls, but in No. 1 the distal half of the original whorl persists, while in Nos. 2, 3, and 4, the persisting half is the proximal, the loop opening forward in all three cases. Fig. 5 displays a fourth interdigital area without a pattern, but with the second and third in the form of loops, and in Fig. 6, there is an almost complete reduction of the third also. Fig. 7 has completed the effacement of the third and fourth areas, but, on the other hand, there is a complete whorly on the second area. In Figs. 8 and 9, which are quite similar to each other, the whorl on the hallucal pattern, the first, has broken down into a loop, opening up into the interval between the first and second toes, while the only other persisting pattern is that of a broad loop over the third area. This type is almost frequent enough among the Chinese and Japanese to constitute a racial character, altough it is not unknown among other races, as in these cases, which are all European-Americans. Fig. 10. Fig. 11. Fig. 12.</page><page sequence="5">The Phylogeny of the Human Foot. 115 Fig. 10 is a slight reversion showing a modified whorl on the first area. It also shows the frequent squeezed up loop in the second area, not found on any of the other areas. In the remaining four prints (11, 12, 13, 14) the patterns are entirely effaced in the last three areas, while the hallucal pattern persists, a whorl in Fig. 11, a twin loop in Fig. 12 and a simple loop in Figs. 13 and 14. These two last are thus the most degenerate, or perhaps huma nized, in the entire collection. Fig. 15. Fig. 16. We may now express in the form of diagrams the teachings of this representative collection. Figure 15 shows the extreme human type of sole, with the almost complete effacement of the ancestral record, and the replacement by a series of parallel lines. Over the distal area, the ?ball" of the foot, these lines run obliquely across from an outer distal to an inner proximal position, and as all the forms found in mammals are as if they were the direct result of forces running across the lines, these indicate a continual friction with the ground in walking, the force directed from the side of the great toe in front obliquely towards the outer side proximally. This would be actually the direction of the bare human foot when taking a normal step forward. This goal of the human foot is seldom so nearly complete as in this diagram. More often there are remaining some indications of the earlier</page><page sequence="6">116 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. condition. A nearly extreme human type, representing the other end of the series, is shown in Diagram II (Fig. 16). Here there are four inter digital patterns, in the form of either whorls, or loops, and with a loop, representing the Hypothenar pattern, just proximal to them. The first, or hallucal, pattern is still in the form of a whorl, corresponding to its great importance in the act of stepping, as it bears the chief impact of the foot, and the chief strain of the bodily weight. From this form, the most primitive that occurs in the men of the present day, we may pass to Diagram III (Fig. 17), which is wholly theoretical, but simply completes the ancestral con dition, as indicated by the more primitive soles of the present time. In the distal half the only modi fication is that all of the patterns are given in the form fo whorls, yet each one of the five whorls rests upon actual cases already known. We must freely confess that we are not absolutely certain con cerning the primitive condition of the more proximal portion, especially that of the long calcar addition, which forms the most characteristically human modi fication of the entire foot. There was certainly once a typical Thenar pattern, but as this originally came in the hollow on the inner side of the foot, where it got little contact with external surfaces, it has de Fig 17 generated very much, even in the most primitive cases, and has never been found in the form of a complete whorl. Doubt is also felt concerning the Calcar pattern, which may never have been an independent pattern, but one portion of a much prolonged pattern, of which the rest may be seen in the hypo thenar remnants of present day men. This Diagram III may be taken, not only as the theoretical type of primitive human foot to which our most primitive actual prints lead us, but as representing the probable sort of pattern that obtained in the earlier human species, such as Homo neandertalensis or Homo heidel bergensis. Should chance ever hold for our scrutiny the prints of such men, as is still possible on the clay bottoms of caves, we may see foot prints with some such configuration. The Footprints of the little Gorilla ?John Daniel". It is with the greatest interest that we turn to the sole configuration of the great apes, especially the gorilla and chimpanzee. Fortune has recently favored us by the untimely death of ,,John Daniel", the little gorilla in the Ringling Brothers' Circus, which died in New York about</page><page sequence="7">The Phytogeny of the Human Foot. 117 April 30, 1921, at exactly the point in its peripatetic career where it could be the most completely investigated by the largest number of specialists. One of the results was the collection of a number of prints of the left foot, from which, in spite of the great difficulties in the way of getting definite results from a dead body, enough data were collected to give us comparatively complete information concerning this one member. In Figs. 18 and 19 are presented two independent interpretations of the foot in question, drawn from the set of actual prints taken from Fig. 18. Fig. 19. the body. These were by no means the complete prints that result from the usual procedure in the case of a man, where the subject is living and cooperative, and, although the attempts were many, no single one of them furnished anything like a complete picture of the conditions. An interpretation, involving a complete redrawing, was a necessity, and it is a matter of satisfaction that, with nothing to base the work upon these very incomplete prints, and without access to the original plantar skin, the two interpretations should be so nearly alike. In this interpretation we notice first the almost complete effacement of the four interdigital patterns, which, in the human foot, are often so important a feature. With this we notice, as a second characteristic, the course of the ridges over the ball, that are here in the opposite direction from those of man, being placed obliquely from an inner distal to an outer proximal position, instead of one obliquely from an outer distal</page><page sequence="8">118 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. to an inner proximal one. We note further that the disturbances, that is the loops and triradii that form the patterns, are concentrated along the outer edge of the foot. Two other gorilla soles have been published, both by Schlagin haufen, and reproduced here (Figs. 20, 21). In both we note the com plete loss of the last three interdigital patterns and the direction of the ridges of this region, obliquely from an inner distal to an outer proximal position. In both also the main disturbances lie along the outer edge, suggesting that the main contact area is situated here. There is a good Fig. 20. Fig. 21. first interdigital loop, occupying the wide space between the first and second digits, and emphasizing the opposable charcter of the first digit, which frequently experiences contact with objects placed in this interval. It is noticed that in one of the interpretations of John Daniel this first interdigital loop is definitely given, and not in the other, yet its occurrence seems rather probable after the analogy of the other two specimens. The key to all these characteristics, and the differences we find between the gorilla and man, seems to lie in the different use of the first digit. In the gorilla the opposability of this member is still retained while in man it has been given up, and the digit itself has been moved up (distally) until it is almost in line with the other toes. This has thrown the weight in man more upon the medial side of the ball, whence the retention of the hallucal pattern, which forms such a constant character. The formation of the transverse arch</page><page sequence="9">The Phylogeny of the Human Foot. 119 has crowded the interdigital areas together, the effect having been the greatest upon the second one, whence the appearance of being squeezed together, so frequently noticed. The same author publishes also five specimens of the foot of the chimpanzee (Anthropopithecus = Pan) of which the first three are reproduced here (Figs. 22, 23 and 24). All show a Thenar loop (at the base of the thumb), but are apparently without a first interdigital pattern, which ought to lie above (distal to) the Thenar, between it and the second digit. The first of the three patterns that lie at the bases of the toes in Figs. 22 and 23 might be this, but it seems more likely, that the three patterns that lie across the bases of the lesser toes in these two cases represent the second, third, and fourth interdigitals, with the first dropped out. The S-shaped figure that follows this row along the outer side proximally may be the equivalent of the two found in John Daniel, and if this be accepted it fixes the homology of the very important triradius that limits this pattern pro ximally in all four (the three chimpanzees and John Daniel). This is Schlaginhaufen's Triradius 9, and while not-employing the morpho logical plan of Miss Whipple he finds this a very reliable point upon which to base homologies. In the chimpanzee figured in Fig. 29, in the complete absence of all interdigital patterns whatever, this triradius is about the only thing we have for comparisons, and it is interesting that in nearly all of the chimpanzees, and in the gorilla, John Daniel, this triradius limits distally an extensive loop opening proximally and tibially, perhaps the equivalent of the human Calcar. Fig. 22. Fig. 23.</page><page sequence="10">120 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. For further comparisons we have three of MiB Whipple's sketches of feet of lower monkeys, an Inuus (?) and two Cebi. As these are draw ings, rather than prints, the position of the thumb is reversed from that Fig. 26. Fig. 27. of prints, yet all are those of left feet, the same as the rest. In Fig. 25, a large monkey, probably Inuus, all four of the interdigital patterns are shown with the first placed near the Thenar pattern. There is a hypo thenar, and, proximal to Triradius 9 of Schlaginhaufen is a loop which may represent the Calcar, although the loop is pointed the other way.</page><page sequence="11">The Phytogeny of the Human Foot. 121 In the first of the two Gebi (Fig. 26) the Calcar loop points in the usual way, but of the four interdigital patterns the first appears close to the Thenar, in the position it is almost always found in the human hand when a Thenar appears at all. The second is here completely wanting while the third and fourth are present, but much reduced. In the second Fig. 30. Fig. 31. Cebus (Fig. 27) there is a complete Calcar pattern, a whorl instead of a loop, with the Thenar close to it, but of all the rest of the possible patterns only a single one, the fourth interdigital, is represented. The others have vanished without a trace. Finally, in order to avail ourselves of some of the side-lights of the subject, I present from further drawings of Primate palms (Fig. 28, an Orang-utan, Fig. 29, an Inuus (probably), Fig. 30, a Cebus and Fig. 31, an Alouatta. In these there is no difficulty in recognizing the same pat tern which we have learned in the feet, with the possible exception</page><page sequence="12">122 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. of the Calcar, and in certain of these, especially in Fig. 30 (Inuus) and in Fig. 31 (Alouatta), are found suggestions of a possible derivation of this new pattern from a portion of an original hypothenar, prolonged into an S, and then dismembered. General Conclusions. It will already have been noticed, that in all studies of Friction-skin Configuration complete reliance may be put upon the condition of the patterns, the retention of their primitive condition in the form of whorls indicating a frequent contact with external surfaces during the ordinary activities of life, while the various degrees of degeneration, up to a complete effacement indicate a diminution of the amount or frequency of contact. A second principle, or perhaps a continuation of the first, is that the direction of the ridges, whether they help to form a pattern or simply cover an area, indicates the more usual direction in which the contact is applied, this being in all cases at right angles to the direction of the ridges. These two principles were first laid down by MiB Whipple (Mrs. H. H. Wilder) in her initial paper on the subject in 1904, and this has been corroborated by all subsequent study, so that we may consider it as sufficiently well established to use as a basis for theories. Using these principles as a basis it seems clear that the main differen ces between the four large Anthropoids on the one hand, and man on the other, in the configuration of the friction-ridges, may be well accounted for by the loss of the thumb function of the first digit in the former, and the changes seen in human soles are plainly just such as would be caused by lifting this digit into line with the others, and giving up all attempts to use it in an opposable manner. This is the fundamental difference in the foot in general of these two groups of primates, and that this would have been found to be the case from the testimony furnished by the friction-skin configuration alone, could have been readily deduced by a being unfamiliar with the bodily peculiarities of either group, a morphologist in the planet Mars, for instance, if he had been sent the illustrations from this paper, without further comment. This difference in the use of the first digit must have taken place a long time ago, before man had arrived at the present species, or even the present Genus, and thus all attempts to reproduce early man, with an opposable first digit are very doubtful indeed. The chimpanzee is nearer man in the matter of interdigital patterns, for these are for the most part retained in the chimpanzee, while effaced in the gorilla; yet other characters, especially the general direction of the ridges, transverse across the sole in man, and longitudinal in the great apes, show a less</page><page sequence="13">The Phytogeny of the Human Foot. 123 profound modification in the latter group. Man must have put the first toe up in line with the rest very early in his career, and must also have begun walking with all five toes in this position as soon as this change was effected, or before. For the further consideration of this problem, we still have too few data. Of the chimpanzee, from which we are endeavoring to draw sweep ing conclusions, we have, all told, scarcely half a dozen individuals, and for the gorilla we have but three separate soles; and as we are stu dying a tendency, which takes many generations to accomplish, * and constantly shows a reversion in this or that single case of a large number of details, we can get hardly more than surmise. For example, if of man we had only the first four, or the last four, of our series presented here, what conclusions could we have made concerning the tendencies or even of the habitual use of the human foot. Our scientiest from Mars would have been sadly misled.</page><page sequence="14">124 Harris Hawthorne Wilder. List of the Figures. 1?14.
