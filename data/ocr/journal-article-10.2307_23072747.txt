It argues that al-Sam'ani, through his authorship of Kitdb al-Ansdb and the wide criteria of inclu sion under the umbrella of ansdb that this biographical dictionary displayed, intended to over come the cultural divisions based on the use of different bases of identification in the society of his day and to earn the title of the mujaddid of his time. These implicit claims of al-Sam'ani, I finally argue, may have been one of the reasons behind the rivalry that pitted his younger con temporary Ibn al-jawzl against him. Sommaire Cet article examine la contribution d Abd al-Karîm al-Sam anî (b. 506/1113; d. 562/1166). Il soutient qu'al-Sam'ànï, en écrivant le Kitâb al-Ansâb et dû au larges critères d'inclusion sous le terme ansâb que ce dictionnaire biographique a affiché, avait l'intention de surmonter les divi sions culturelles émanant de l'utilisation de différentes bases d'identification dans la société de son jour et de gagner le titre du mujaddid de son temps. Finalement, je propose que ces revendi cations implicites d'al-Samanî peuvent avoir été une des causes de la rivalité que son jeune contemporain Ibn al-Jawzï a exhibé contre lui. Keywords al-Sam'äni; ansäb; Ibn al-jawzl; tajdid; mujaddid Modern scholars have had slightly different understandings of what the Shuübiyya movement exactly stood for, but the movement manifested itself for a few centuries in a literary and cultural tension between Arab Muslims and non-Arab Muslims (most particularly Persians) or at least between those whose cultural vision and interests coincided with either group, sometimes regardless of actual ethnicity. Scholars also mostly agree that the Shuübiyya controversy began to die out in the sixth/twelfth century. This timing is impor tant for the purposes of this article as it coincides with Abd al-Karim al-Sam äni's life and contribution. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011 DOI: 10.1163/187783711X588105</page><page sequence="2">166 M.

Al-Sam'änl (b. 506/1113; d. 562/1166) was, by the recognition of many of his contemporaries and later authorities, an outstanding scholar who authored, among other things, the important biographical dictionary of eastern scholars entitled Kitäb al-Ansäb. In what follows, I would like to examine the Kitäb al-Ansäb and assess al-Sam'änl's contribution in it. I will argue that al- Sam'änl was very aware of the communal divisions in the Muslim society of his day, and in his choice of title, form and coverage for his book, was consciously undertaking a monumental work of (re)conciliation that was meant to bring the community back together, and allow Muslims to bypass the differences among them that stemmed from their divergent frames of reference and bases of cultural identity and pride.1 In doing so, he was intending his work to be revolutionary, tantamount to a work of religious revival, and was setting him self to be remembered for its being so. In what follows I will examine why I believe this to have been his intent, and investigate the possible rivalry that this self-representation may have afforded him with one of his most prominent younger contemporaries as they contested their respective legacies and influ ences on the sixth/twelfth century. The high praise for al-Sam an! is attested for by his contemporary Ibn Asäkir (d. 571/1175), in Ibn Asäkir, Ta'rikh Dimashq, tahqlq, ta'llq wa-takhrlj 'All Äshür al-Janübl (Bayrüt: Dar Ihyä' al-Turäth al-'Arabi, 2001), 38:317-8; and by later authorities such as Ibn al-Athlr (d. 630/1233) in Ibn al-Athlr, al-Lubäb fi tahdhib al-ansäb, dabatahü wa-haqqaqa usülahü Abd al-Latlf ' Al-Sam'änI's approach and purpose in this respect is somewhat similar to that of Abu Ishäq al-ShlräzI (d. 476/1083) in his Tabaqät al-Fuqaba and Abd al-Wahhäb al-FärisI (d. 499/1106) in his Tarikh al-Fuqaha. As Chase Robinson has noted, each of these authors, in including in their respective books "the key jurists of all the main schools" at a time "of increasing inter-school rivalries" managed to produce what effectively served as "a work of conciliation", in Chase F.

Al-Sam'änl's rather short and critical biography in the work of the Ibn Taymiyya-influenced and thus Hanball-leaning Shäfi'l Ibn Kathlr (d. 774/ 1373) reproduces almost verbatim the critique of al-Sam'änl by his younger Hanball contemporary Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 597/1201) in the latter's al-Muntazam fi ta'rikh al-mulük wa-l-umam, a critique that will be addressed in the latter part of this article (see Ibn Kathlr, al-Bidäya wa-l-nihäya, i'tinä' wa-tawthlq Abd al-Rahmän al-Lädhiql wa-Muhammad Ghäzl Baydün [Bayrüt: Dar al-Ma'rifa, 2005], 6:771). It is though worth mentioning that not all Hanballs followed Ibn al-Jawzl's example in being critical of al-Sam'änl, for the elev enth/seventeenth century scholar Ibn al-'Imäd (d. 1089/1678-9) had nothing but praise for al-Sam'änl (in Ibn al-'Imäd, Shadharät al-dhahab fi akhbdr man dhahab, ashrafa 'alä tahqiqihl wa-kharraja ahädlthahü Abd al-Qädir Arnä'üt, haqqaqahü wa-'allaqa alayhi Mahmüd Arnä'üt [Dimashq, Bayrüt: Där Ibn Kathlr, 1986-1993], 6:257). The Nature of Kitab al-Ansab First, I will examine the Kitäb al-Ansäb and show what was really new about it so that al-Samänl may have deemed it worthy of his contemporaries' acco lades. As mentioned, al-Sam'änl's book despite its title was not a book of gene alogy per se, but rather a biographical dictionary arranged according to the nisbas or ascriptions under which the listed individuals had come to be known; these included ascriptions relating to genealogical descent, regional affiliation whether by origin or settlement, professional specialization, sectarian, legalis tic or theological identification, and even ascriptions relating to physical traits or handicaps. In the Kitäb al-Ansäb, all these ascriptions are treated equally and recognized as valid modes of identification. Al-Sam änl's Kitäb al-Ansäb therefore shares with books of genealogy a par ticular attention to the principle of nisba, but here the term is adopted in its broadest sense possible to include far more than just kinship affinities and is</page><page sequence="4">168 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 now used in that sense as an organizational tool. By incorporating every pos sible nisba (and therefore all nisab or ascriptions) under the heading of ansäb, al-Sam'änl was indicating that affinities of all kinds were valid identifiers (and similar to genealogical identifiers), thus symbolically and practically fusing the slightly distinct meanings of nasab and nisba for his reconciliatory purposes. The Kitäb al-Ansäb also shares with other books of ansäb and with biographi cal dictionaries their schematic approach: Just as books of ansäb list only the notable individuals within each clan and tribe, and biographical dictionaries list only the important individuals of an age, profession or locale, the Kitäb al-Ansäb does the same. There is no place here either for the social reject, or for the intellectually feeble minded. In his Kitäb al-Ansäb, al-Sam änl also adopts a very wide policy of inclusion, that will later become characteristic of the works of scholars like al-Safadi (d. 764/1363) and al-Dhahabl (d. 832/1429),2 as it contains entries on prom inent Muslims from a wide range of classes and periods (from the first genera tion of Muslims up to al-Sam'änl's own contemporaries), and lists these prominent Muslims alphabetically according to the various ascriptions under which each was most well know. Moreover, the derivation of all ascriptions is explained, and they are completely and properly vocalized in order to allow for correct pronunciation and to avert confusions of any kind. This feature was no doubt inspired by the sub-genre of al-mu'talif wa-l-mukhtalif,i which had begun since the third/ninth century to focus on means of differentiating between similar names (certainly those that share consonantal letters) by vocalizing unusual names to avoid mispronunciation, explaining the deriva tion of names and differentiating between different entities that shared the same name.4 Al-Sam'änl also shared wich the sub-genre of al-mu'talif wa-l-mukhtalifthe. use of the alphabetical ordering. Al-Sam'änl did not therefore invent this method of exposition, but his adoption of the alphabetical format for his Kitäb al-Ansäb is still somewhat revolutionary, since alphabetically-arranged works 2 Michael Cooperson, Classical Arabic Biography (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 17. 3 See, for example, al-WazIr ibn al-Maghribl (d. 418/1027), al-Inäs bi-ilm al-ansäb (Bür Said: Maktabat al-Thaqäfa al-Dlniyya, 2000); Ibn Makula (d. 475/1082), Raf al-irtiyäb 'an al-mu'talif wa-l-mukhtalif min al-asma wa-l-kunä wa-l-ansäb (Haydarabäd: Majlis Dä'irat al-Maarif al-'Uthmäniyya, 1381/1961); Ibn al-Qaysaräni (d. 507/1113), al-Mutalif wa-l mukbtalif taqdlm wa-fahrasat Kamäl Yüsuf al-Hüt (Bayrüt: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1991). 4 A related sub-genre, the ishtiqäq, that addresses one of these same concerns, namely the derivation of names, began to appear in the third/ninth century, but did not at first systemati cally adopt the alphabetical ordering as in Ibn Durayd al-Azdi, Kitäb al-Ishtiqdq, tahqiq wa-sharh Abd al-Saläm Muhammad Härün (Baghdad: Maktabat al-Muthannä, 1979).</page><page sequence="5">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 169 do not necessarily include everyone, but those that are included, tend to be presented on an equal footing, in the sense that the alphabetical arrangement provides somewhat of a rigid structure that does not allow anyone prominence based on their greater ancestral importance.5 Thus, whereas for example, the HäshimI, Qurashl, Mudari and other North Arabians had preceded everyone else in earlier books of ansäb, Muslims from these groups were here, at least in form, treated like everyone else.6 But, the alphabetical arrangement was by no means the innovation of al-Sam ani, and in adopting this organizational for mat he was following a trend that had begun in the third/ninth century and came to be increasingly used in biographical dictionaries of various kinds.7 It is however in the combination of the alphabetical arrangement, the all inclusive terminology and the scale of the project that al-Sam'äni's contribu tion ought to be judged and evaluated; for that is exactly what makes it singular. Prior books of nasab or ansäb, whether using the term in the singular or plural form in their titles, had exclusively dealt with Arab Muslim notables and used their genealogical descent as a basis of organization; al-Sam'äni, by using the term ansäb in the plural to refer to such a plethora of meanings, and in a book that included both Arab and non-Arab Muslims arranged alpha betically according to their various adjectival ascriptions, managed to redefine the term ansäb, widening its range of meanings thereafter to be more inclusive of non-lineal ascriptions. In doing so, al-Sam'äni offered a fresh template that could be used as a new basis for future works, and set a new standard of approach. Thus, like Ibn al-Kalbi's work before it, his compilation became the basis for later ansäb works. Ibn al-Athlr (d. 630/1233) completed his work and abridged it in his al-Lubäb fi l-ansäb, al-Suyütl (d. 911/1505) in turn edited Ibn al-Athir's abridgment and updated it in his Lubb al-lubäb, and so 5 Of course, there were sometimes some exceptions even within the otherwise rigid alpha betical organization, as some books of biography and rijäl, which adopted the alphabetical arrangement, still made concessions to those who bore the name Muhammad often advancing them over others because that was deemed auspicious. Al-Bukhärl's Ta'rikh began with the Muhammads as mentioned in Shäkir Mustafa, al-Ta'rikh al-'arabl wa-l-mu arrikhün (Bayrüt: Dar al-'Ilm li-l-Maläyin, 1983), 1:430-1, and so did al-Safadl, in his Kitäb al-Wäfi bi-l-wafayät, where he covers the Muhammads in his first volumes after treating with the biography of the Prophet Muhammad himself. But again, this is done for auspicious reasons, not because any of these Muhammads, aside from Prophet Muhammad himself, were deemed ancestrally superior to others. 6 Cooperson has noted the equalizing effect of the alphabetical arrangement in relation to Ibn Khallikän's usage of it in his Wafayät al-a ydn, in Cooperson, Classical Arabic Biography, 17. See also Ibn Khallikän's own argument for the alphabetical usage in Ibn Khallikän, Wafayät al-a'yän, 1:20. 7 See Mustafa, al-Ta'rikh al-arabi wa-l-mu arrikhün, 1:429-30. Mustafa mentions Ibn Yäsln's Ta'rikh Herat and al-Bukharis Ta'rikh rijäl al-hadith as the first examples of that trend.</page><page sequence="6">170 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 did al-Khaydarl (d. 894/1488) who, in his Kitäb al-Iktisäb, summarized it again and updated it by incorporating the additions of Ibn al-Athlr and con tent derived from other works.8 This new template did not altogether displace the older model of purely genealogical ansäb, but it provided a more inclusive competing model. Nasab, nisba and ansäb: A Subtle Lexical Shift Cemented by al-Sam äni Al-Sam änl's insistence on using the terms nasab and nisba as being both sub sumed under the plural ansäb, which he then used in its broadest sense in his title, was a culmination of a process of redefining and broadening the range of meanings of these terms that had begun before his time and became overtime increasingly evident in lexicographical works. Yet, al-Sam'änl's own usage of these terms in such a fluid manner seems to have hastened the redefinition and conflation of the terms nasab and nisba after the sixth/twelfth century to mean not only lineage-based affiliation but also non-lineage based ones. A cursory examination of the root n-s-b in Arabic dictionaries dating from the second/ eighth to the thirteenth/eighteenth centuries confirms this reading. Whereas both terms nasab and nisba are cited under the root n-s-b as mostly distinct in meaning from one another in earlier dictionaries with nasab being particularly defined as relating to kinship and the plural ansäb relating only to lineage based identifications, the terms nasab and nisba come to be increasingly treated as synonymous overtime, despite some ambiguity in the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries, with this phenomenon being most clearly evident in post-sixth/twelfth century dictionaries, when a subtle expansion of the defini tion of ansäb allows it to incorporate non-lineage based identifications along side the lineage based ones. This transformation is though subtle as it allowed for the non-lineage based affiliations to count as part of recognized ansäb, while lineage-based ansäb remained the more standard part of most defini tions. A cursory look at the evolution of this phenomenon in pre-modern Arabic dictionaries will convey the delicate but nevertheless significant change that al-Sam'änfs work helped achieve. For example, al-Khalll b. Ahmad (d. 175/786) adduces two meanings under the root n-s-b. For the term al nasab, he simply gives one meaning: al-nasab fi l-qaräbät, that is, nasab relates to kinship relations, whereas he defines al-nisba as masdar al-intisäb (the source 8 See Hajji Khalifa, Kashf al-zunün 'an asämi l-kutub wa-1-fiinün (Istanbul: Milli Egitim Basimevi, 1941), 1:179; Abu Zayd, Tabaqät al-nassäbin (Riyäd: Däral-Rushd, 1987), 115.</page><page sequence="7">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 171 of affiliation) whatever that may be.9 Ibn Durayd (d. 321/933) in his defini tion seems to give precedence to the meaning of nasab as lineage, but other wise reproduces the same distinction between nasab and nisba as al-Khalll b. Ahmad, stating: al-nasab: ma'rüf; nasabtubü, ansubuhü nasaban wa-nisbatan, wa-l-ismu l-nasabu; wa-ntasaba l-rajulu ay dhakara nasabahü!' ([The meaning of] al-nasab is known; I have identified his nasab means I identify him by nasab (lineage) and nisba (affiliation), and the noun is al-nasab. And intasaba l-rajulmeans that he mentioned his nasab (lineage)."10 Al-Azharl (d. 370/980) recycles the two definitions adduced by al-Khalll b. Ahmad (nasab relates to kinship relations/««^ is the source of affiliation), adding though at the bot tom of the entry, and perhaps as a first concession to the increasingly diverse society of his time, that al-nasab yakün bi-l-äba (nasab is through fathers), yakün ilä biläd (is to a region), yakün bi-l-sinaa (is to a trade)." However, al-Azhari is somewhat unique in this concession at this time, as his younger contemporary, Isma il b. Abbäd (d. 385/995) engages in no such contortions, reproducing once again only the traditional and somewhat distinct definitions of al-Khalll b. Ahmad.12 However, by the late fourth/early eleventh century, a clear move towards a more fluid definition of the terms is evident in the work of Isma il b. Hammäd (d. 393/1003) and even more so in that of Ibn Färis (d. 395/1004). Whereas Ismail b. Hammäd begins his definition of nasab by mentioning that it is wähid al-ansäb (one of the ansäbs, with ansäb here presumably meaning sources of ascription), he continues by stating that nisba (term traditionally understood to mean non-parental ascription) and nusba (term traditionally understood to mean a name, traditionally a lineage based one) are the same, i.e, each one constitutes a means of ascription, but Ibn Hammäd fails to define the two terms any further. However, beyond seemingly introducing this equalizing treatment between parental and non parental means of reference, the rest of Ibn Hammäd's entry under n-s-b focuses on the meaning of the term that relates to kinship/lineage and there fore means parental ascription indicating that this remained up to that point the more common understanding of the term.13 During the same period, Ibn 9 al-Farähldi, Kitäb al-'Ayn (Baghdad: al-Jumhüriyya al-'Iräqiyya, Wizärat al-Thaqäfa wa-1 I'läm/Där al-Rashid, 1980-5), 7:271-2. 10 Ibn Durayd, Kitäb Jamharat al-lugha, tahqlq Ramzi Ba'iabakk!

Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 Färis (d. 395/1004), in his entry under n-s-b, opts not to define any of the terms derived from this root but mentions that the criterion used in words of this root is ittisäl shay' bi-shay (the connection of one thing to another), a statement that in some way helped convey the existence of a trend that saw greater elasticity in the concepts derived from this root.14 Yet, this is still only one trend and not necessarily the overwhelming one, for as late as the mid fifth/eleventh century, the famous Andalusian philologist and lexicographer Ibn Sida (d. 458/1066) continued to equate nisba, nusba and nasab, defining them all as al-qaräba or parentage, and adding that it was fi l-äba khässatan (through one's fathers especially), while emphasizing the kinship-related meaning of many of the terms rooted in n-s-b.15 However, dictionaries com piled after al-Sam'ani's time, such as those of Ibn Manzur (d. 711/1311) and al-Zabldi (d. 1205/1790) seem to have more emphatically reprised the plural ity of meanings of nasab advocated in the Tahdhib. And even though the most commonly cited derivatives from the n-s-b root, as cited in either dictionary, were still related to kinship-based affiliation, the definition of the term nasab as potentially relating to region or occupation is featured earlier in the text of both entries. Moreover, al-Zabldi explicitly specifies that citing the nasab of a man means: an tadbkura l-rajula fa-taqulu: huwa fiilanu bnu fiilanin, aw tansibahü / tansubahü ila qabilatin aw baladin aw sinaatin (to mention the man and say: he is such and such son of such and such, or to ascribe him to a tribe, region or occupation), allowing therefore — in al-Sam'änl's vein — for all these types of ascriptions to pass for nasab and to equally identify any given man.16 The redefinition, and the consequent broadening of the scope of the term nasab as used by al-Sam'änl, although subtly evident in the lexicographical realm is though most clearly perceptible in later authors' writings. It definitely found echo with later authors of biographical dictionaries, who began to use the term in the same manner as al-Samanl, calling ascriptions to various enti ties as nasab. For example, al-Safadl in the introduction to his al-Wäfi bi-L wafayät tells us that a nasab or ascription is meaning-wise an idäfa (an ascription or attribution) that is idäfat shay' ilä balad aw qarya aw sinaa (ascribing something to a town or a village or a trade), but that he calls this a 14 Ibn Färis al-Qazwini, Mujam maqäyis al-lugha, tahqlq Abd al-Saläm Härün (al-Qähira: Dar Ihyä' al-Kutub al-'Arabiyya, 1946-51), 5:423-4. 15 Ibn Sida, al-Muhkam wa-l-muhit al-azam, tahqlq 'Abd al-Hamld Hindäwl (Bayrüt: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 2000), 8:529. 16 Ibn Manzür, Lisän al-arab (Büläq: al-Matba'a al-Mlriyya, 1300/1882), 2:252-3 and al-Zabldi, Täj al-arüs min jawähir al-qämüs, tahqlq Abd al- Alim al-TahäwI, muräja'at Muhammad Bahjat al-Atharl wa-'Abd al-Sattär Ahmad Farräj (al-Kuwayt: Wizärat al-Irshäd wa-l-Inbä', 1965-2001), 4:260-5, especially 261.</page><page sequence="9">M.

Al-Sam am: A Conscious Renewer? The scope and breadth of Kitäb al-Ansäb are not all that al-Sam an! wanted to be remembered for. In what follows, I would like to argue that al-Sam'änl envisaged a more enduring legacy than the mere collection of a broad based biographical dictionary of traditionists; that he was very conscious of the inclusive and conciliatory nature of his work; that he considered that function essential for the renewal of Muslim society; and that he wanted posterity to remember him because of that as the religious renewer of his time. While this may seem as a daring suggestion, a quick look at the way al-Sam'ani intro duced his work may help substantiate this claim. Preambles, although mostly conventional in form, often provide a space where an author may contextual ize and theorize his work, provide a rare glimpse into his real intentions, and therefore offer a window into his soul. It is also a space where he could address his readership more directly, and potentially influence through his presenta tion their thoughts and reactions to his project.181 would like to suggest that al-Sam'änl did just that and that his introduction, and in particular its first two and a half pages, sowed the seed for his revivalist claim. Al-Sam änl began his Kitäb al-Ansäb in a very telling way. After the usual praise given to God and prophet Muhammad, in which he emphasized the 17 al-Safadl, Das biographische Lexikon des Salähaddin Halil ibn Aibak as-Safadi, herausgege ben von Hellmut Ritter (Wiesbaden: in Kommission bei Franz Steiner, 1962), 1:22-23. 18 Aboubakr Chrai'bi notes that the muqaddima in Arabic literary works "peut se presenter, par rapport au reste du livre, comme le seul effort de theorisation engage pat l'auteur." Chrai'bi adds that, since book-writing and, as a consequence, muqaddima writing were preceded for the Arabs by a longer tradition of writing of epistolary letters for which elaborate conventions had been developed, once the Arabs began to engage in book writing and muqaddima writing, "la muqaddima reproduit formellement l'epitre; elle en reprend meme la fonction, comme une sorte de 'lettre au lecteur'" in Aboubakr Chrai'bi, "L'Emergence du genre 'Muqaddima' dans la littera ture arabe," in Entrer en matiere: les prologues, ed.

Surayj (d. 306/918) were credited as being the mujaddids or renewers of the Muslim community and faith after Muhammad, in the first/seventh, second/eighth and third/ninth centuries respectively. In the language ot the khabar, each of these renewers was recognized as such for having proclaimed and strengthened the sunna (Ar. azhara l-sunnal qawwd kull sunna) and for having weakened or defeated bad innovations (Ar. amdta, akhfd, da'af l-bid'a).19 By doing so, each had fulfilled the two related func tions that have been traditionally associated with mujaddids, and therefore recognized as "the essence of tajdid,"20 The subject of centennial renewal (tajdid) relates to the well-known hadith in which Muhammad is said to have declared that God will send to his com munity at the ras of every hundred years one who will renew for it its reli gion.21 The concept of tajdid as a means by which God allowed for the reinvigoration of his community was already well established by al-Sam'änls time.22 Suffice it to say that, after citing this khabar, and without further ado, al-Sam'änl moved on to inform his readers that ilm al-ma'ärif wa-l-ansäb was one of the most important of the sciences that God had prescribed upon the 19 al-Sam'äni, al-Ansäb, wada'a hawäshiyahü Muhammad 'Abd al-Qädir Atä (Bayrüt: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1998), 1:10. 20 On this, see the definitions of tajdidespoused by al-'Alqami and al-Häkim in al-'AzImabadi as cited in Hamid Algar, "Hie Centennial Renewer: Bediüzzaman Said Nursi and the Tradition of Tajdid?

We have created you from male and female, and have made you nations and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, the noblest of you in the sight of God, is that who is most pious." Having cited this Quranic verse, and as if its mean ing was not clear enough and its disparaging of genealogical vanity not emphatic enough, al-Sam'änl hastened to reveal the occasion of this verses revelation, referring to the speech that Muhammad had given on the day of the conquest of Mecca, when he addressed the people saying: "Now then, God all powerful and exalted has taken away from you the disgrace of thejähiliyya with its glorification of ancestors, for men are of two kinds: a pious god-fear ing one, who is valuable to God and a dissolute wretch who is insignificant in the eyes of God."23 From the reference to and elaboration on this crucial Quranic verse, it becomes evident that al-Sam'änl was reading this verse and the sunna of Muhammad as ascribing value to all pious god-fearing men regardless of their ancestry. In this context, his mention of the mujaddids!renewers is revealed to be both deliberate and suggestive as he seems to intimate that he intends to undertake in his work such a gargantuan task of communal reconciliation and cultural synthesis in support of the prophetic sunna, which he had just referred to, and therefore in line with the famous mujaddids of earlier centuries. Such a deliberate insinuation was as far as al-Sam'änl could go short of actually proclaiming himself as the next mujaddid, such action would have been anath ema as it would have reeked of self-promotion, and ignored the essential fact that the identification of mujaddids as traditionally understood up to that time entailed for the most part a large degree of communal and scholarly rec ognition. Yet, suggestions and innuendo were allowed, and al-Sam'änl was neither the first nor the last to make such suggestions and wish for the attain ment of such recognition. He was preceded in this by no less than al-Ghazäll (d. 505/1111) whose death shortly followed the end of the fifth Muslim cen tury, and who had made a similar suggestion, but a much more explicit one, in explaining his return to teaching in 499/1106, as expressed in his al Munqidh min al-daläl.1'' The fact that aside from 'Umar b.

Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 later recognized mujaddids up until al-Sam änl's time had been scholars, may have not been too far from al-Sam'änis mind as he set up to undertake this project. Al-Sam änl's reference to the ilm al-ansäb and to the aforementioned Qur anic verse was also an indication of the form that his work of reconcilia tion was going to take and to the ailment which had beset the community that he intended to redress in order, we assume, to uphold the sunna of Muhammad, continue his work and earn the honor of being the mujaddid of his own time.25 In fact, al-Sam'änl immediately proceeds to explain the form that his work of reconciliation will take by referring to the benefit of knowing ansäbl ascriptions as one of the reasons facilitating the establishment of har mony, likening this to God's intention in his creation of people speaking vari ous languages (alsina), and being of different shapes (suwar), colors (alwän), and natural dispositions (fitar), referring once more to the Qur än (Q 30:22) in support of his argument.26 Moreover, as the paragraph unfolds, it becomes also clear that what al-Sam'änl is already referring to is the widest possible definition of the term ansäb, i.e, ascriptions deriving from a tribe (qabila), a tribal division (batn), a relation of clientage (wala), a town (balda), a village (.qarya), an ancestral name (jadd) or nickname (laqab li-ba d ajdädih) a pro fessional affiliation (hirfa) or even a physical peculiarity or handicap. Having explained his intention, he continues by providing a brief summary of his project, how it came about at the urging of a friend (a generic reason cited by many authors), how he began to collect information for it and writing it in the year 550/1156, what he decided to include and exclude from it, a brief expla nation of the alphabetical arrangement that he decided to adopt for it, as well as a description of the biographical notices that it will contain. This task of setting the project ahead occupies only the first two and a half pages of al-Sam'änl's introduction to his work, yet it sets the tone for the whole work. The remaining thirty seven and a half pages of this introduction seem to be a negotiation and fine-tuning of his position on the matter of genealogies and the place they should occupy in Islamic societies. 25 It is irrelevant in this particular case whether one understands the term ras to mean begin ning or end of a century, because al-Sam'äni who was born only a few years after the beginning of the sixth Muslim century (b. 506/1113) probably assumed that his life would extend over a good part of the century, and therefore that the fruit of his work would earn the recognition of his successors who may recognize him as the renewer of the sixth century/twelfth century. Chro nology apart, the fact that he died at the relatively young age of fifty-six in 562/1166 would not have precluded him from making such assumptions in the year 550/1156, when he had first conceived of this gigantic project and set out to implement it. 26 Q 30:22 reads "And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the differ ence of your languages and colours. Herein indeed are portents for men of knowledge."</page><page sequence="13">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 177 In approaching ansäb in this manner, al-Sam'änl was not taking an anti Arab or even an anti-genealogy stand, but rather advocating a moderate pur suit of genealogical ties and their documentation, though recognizing perhaps the greater significance of such a pursuit for Arabs as opposed to other peoples. In a sub-section of his introduction entitled Fasl fi l-hathth 'aid ta'allum al-ansdb wa-ma rifatihä, he presents therefore a call for a healthy interest in genealogy, citing a few statements attributed to Muhammad or to early com panions to that effect, including ten versions of the Prophetic hadith that reads, ta'allamü min ansäbikum mä tasilü bih arhämakum (learn of your gene alogies what is sufficient to make close your ties of kinship [by behaving with goodness and affection]).27 However, al-Samäni's also includes other state ments relating to the pursuit of genealogical knowledge and attributed to Muhammad, some positive (bädhä 'ilm lä yadurr ahlah), and others less so (bädhä 'ilm Idyanfa' ivajahl lä yadurr), with a truly negative statement relating particularly to genealogical falsification (man qäl ghayr dhälik fa-'alayh la'nat Alläh).2i Finally, he concludes this section with two anecdotes that seem on the face of it to convey contradictory attitudes towards genealogical knowl edge and its investigation; he cites first an encounter between Caliph Mu'äwiya and the genealogist Daghfal in which Mu'äwiya is said to have recited verses praising ilm and criticizing jahl (presumably including genealogical knowl edge in both cases given that Mu'äwiya's interlocutor was the famous genea logist), and declaring reason and forbearance as the ornaments of those possessing knowledge and good descent. Then, al-Sam'änl follows this anec dote with a statement attributed to the famous philologist al-Asma'l in which he proclaims: "Ask for God's help against the evil of the old ladies of the neigh borhood for they know the forefathers" (Ar. ista'inü bi l-lläh min sharr 'ajd'iz al-hayy, fa-innahunna ya'rifna l-äba). Even though each of these accounts seems to present a different attitude towards genealogical knowledge, their juxtaposition at the end of this section seems to best illustrate al-Sam'änl's assessment of genealogy and its utility. The knowledge of genealogy is neither good nor bad by itself; it could be either depending on the intention and use individuals may make of it. An enlightened reasoned pursuit of genealogy is an essential part of a well-rounded general education, could be a sign of rationality, and a tool of forbearance; but knowledge about genealogy and ancestral history may also be abused by some, and could become the basis for 27 See Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon (London, Edinburgh: Williams and Norgate 1893, repr. Beirut: Librairie du Liban, 1968), 8 (Supplement): 3054-5. 28 al-Sam'äni, al-Ansäb, 1:15.</page><page sequence="14">178 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 perpetrating groundless rumors and idle talk, and probably ethnic, racial or other types of discrimination. As if to illustrate this point further, al-Samani moves on to address one of the positive pursuits of genealogical knowledge, namely the study of Prophet Muhammad's genealogy. In a sub-section of the introduction entitled "A sec tion on the Genealogy of the Messenger of God", al-Sam'änl includes various hadiths attributed to Muhammad in which Muhammad is said to have traced his own genealogy, referred to Abü Bakr to do so, or boasted of his near kin, clan, tribe and larger tribal unit (Kinäna). A sub-section follows this, "on the genealogy of Quraysh", in which genealogical falsification, certainly in rela tion to the Prophetic genealogy, is warned against and many of the genealogi cal divisions are explained. Al-Sam anl proceeds from there to a sub-section "on the Genealogy of the rest of the Arabs and their origins" in which various hadiths are used to link many of the Arabs together, identifying them to be of common ancestry (p. 21), as well as one hadith in which Muhammad identi fies the Arabs, Rum and Persians altogether as the descendants of Shem son of Noah, and collectively describes them as al-khayrfihim (p. 22), opposing them in this respect to the descendants of Japheth (the people of Gog and Magog, the Turks and Slavs) who were admonished as lä khayra fihim and the descen dants of Ham (the Copts, Berbers and Blacks), upon whom no further com ment is included. It is obvious that in including this hadith here that lumps together Arabs and Persians as descendants of a common ancestor, and bearers of goodness, al-Sam'änl was further setting the ground for his re-conciliatory project between the Arabs and their Persian cultural opponents. By including this hadith, al-Sam'änl was not necessarily ignoring the growing Turkish pres ence in the Islamic world, but rather was not presenting it here as part of his project. After all, the Arab/non-Arab cultural rivalry was primarily between Arabs and Persians, and the Turkish element had come to dominate the Mid dle East militarily but had not become an equal player on the cultural arena, as the Turks had not retained much of their nomadic indigenous culture after they settled in the Near East favoring instead and adopting for the most part the Persianate culture of the eastern part of the Near East they had come to dominate. Thus going back to the Arabs and to genealogy, as the main point of con tention between Arabs and their Persian rivals, and in consecutive sub-sections on each of Mudar, the Yemeni tribes (including Qahtän), Kahlän and Saba', Qudä'a, as well as various other tribes, al-Sam'änl lists hadtths attributed to Muhammad explaining the origins of some of these tribes and the relationship of some of them to each other (pp. 22-25), as well as the virtues (fadä'il) acquired by some of the humble tribes over far more important ones through</page><page sequence="15">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 179 their early and steady submission to Islam (p. 25). Then, as if returning to his earlier evaluation of genealogical knowledge and its pursuit, al-Sam'änl pro ceeds on to list various anecdotes in which different individuals accuse various tribes of baseness and ignobility, showing how information related to ances tors and genealogy could be used in defamatory ways (pp. 26-8). This is fol lowed by an anecdote about individuals whose ignorance in matters of genealogy extended to Muhammad, his family and the early caliphs, showing the potential horror that neglect of genealogical knowledge may engender (pp. 28-9). By including both these sets of stories, al-Sam'änl seems to weigh in once again on whether the pursuit of genealogical knowledge could be jus tified. The juxtaposition of these accounts ascertains that even though knowl edge of genealogies could be used for negative purposes, an ignorance of them could be equally damning. As if to support his point further, and justify a positive yet restrained pursuit of genealogical knowledge, al-Sam'änl lists a number of additional hadiths in which a positive knowledge of genealogies is illustrated, certainly in relation to its use in support of Muhammad's mission (e.g., p. 33), as well as a number of versions of two anecdotes in which great skill in genealogical knowledge is displayed, and the dangers of genealogical manipulation and false pretensions are illustrated. Al-Sam änl's continued insistence on dealing with ansah in genealogical terms, while in practice expanding the definition of the term, does not stem from any lack of clarity on his part, but from his realization that the term ansäb had, and was going to probably maintain for many people, a strong genealogical connotation. The wider scope of definition that al-Samänl was advocating in order to make ansäb more inclusive of cultures whose basis of identification was not genealogical in nature was not meant to displace the genealogical identification, but sit side by side with it. Ansäb in his reckoning was to retain therefore a healthy dose of genealogical identifications emanating from the Arab cultures where such a pursuit, when done in a temperate way, had a place and purpose, alongside the many non-genealogical identifications that were in usage by the non-Arabs (and increasingly by the Arabs them selves) in Muslim societies of the past, and more particularly in the Iraqi and Khurasan! Muslim societies of his day. Al-Sam anl and Ibn al-jawzl The strongly eastern context of al-Sam änl (al-Sam änl being a native of Khurasan who travelled widely but was centered for a while in Iraq) may also partially explain the relatively negative reception of his work by at least one of</page><page sequence="16">180 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 his younger contemporaries. As mentioned earlier, many of al-Sam änls con temporaries and later authorities have expressed great admiration towards al-Sam'änl and his work and greatly praised his intellectual contributions. However, al-Sam'änl's younger contemporary, Ibn al-JawzT, presents us with a dissenting voice in this regard, as he includes a rather scathing assessment of al-Sam'änl's career and work in his entry on him in his Kitdb al-Muntazarn.2'' At first glance, this harsh treatment of al-Sam'äni seems to be partially based on a Shäfi'l-Hanball inter-school rivalry between the two men, as the Hanball Ibn al-jawzl accuses the Shäfi'l al-Sam'änl of extreme fanaticism (taassub) against the followers of Ibn Hanbal. Of course, Ibn al-JawzT himself was noto riously aggressive against scholars who held opposing dogmatic views than his own, and even though many claim that he had little good to say about many people in his Muntazam, his attack against al-Sam äni is particularly notewor thy not only because he is the only one who impugns al-Sam'änl's character and scholarship, but also because the two men must have crossed paths at some point or co-existed in Baghdädl circles during Ibn al-Jawzl's earlier career.30 Ibn al-jawzl attacked al-Sam'änl, accusing him in particular of waging mali cious charges against some important Hanball teachers, including Ibn Näsir, Ibn al-jawzl's dearest mentor.31 Ibn Näsir had taken charge of the education of the young Ibn al-jawzl after the death of Ibn al-jawzl's father, and had remained strongly involved in the young man's education for close to thirty years up until his own death. He is the one who had introduced him to the madhhab ot Ibn Hanbal, himself having converted in 493/1100 or 494/1101 (i.e., in his mid-twenties) from Shäfi'ism and Ash'arism to Hanbalism, allegedly follow ing a dream he had in which the Prophet instructed him to do so.32 Ibn Näsir may have represented more than a mentor to Ibn al-jawzl, at times perhaps even serving as a father figure in the young orphans life and acting as a strong 29 See Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam ft ta'rlkh al-mulük wa-l-umam, dirasat wa-tahqlq Muhammad 'Abd al-Qädir Atä wa-Mustafä 'Abd al-Qädir Atä (Bayrüt: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1992-3), 18:103-4 and 18:178-9. 30 As already indicated, very few authors seem to pick up on Ibn al-jawzl's harsh assessment of al-Sam'änl, take it any seriously or reproduce it, and when they do, as we will see shortly, it is generally to refute it. 31 For biographical information on Ibn Näsir, see al-Qiftl (d. 624/1226), Inbäh al-ruwät anbä' al-nuhät, tahqlq Muhammad Abu 1-Fadl Ibrahim (al-Qähira: Dar al-Fikr al-Arabi /Bayrüt: Mu'assasat al-Kutub al-Thaqäfiyya, 1986), 3:222-3. 32 On the account of the conversion of Ibn Näsir to Hanbalism, see Ibn Qudäma (d. 620/1223), Kitäb al-Tawwäbin, 'uniya bi-nashrihi wa-tahqiqihl Jürj al-MakdisI [George Makdisi] (Dimashq: al-Ma'had al-faransl li-1-diräsät al-'arabiyya, 1961), 217-9; see also al-Dhahabl (d. 748/1348), Tadhkirat al-hujfaz, 4:1291.</page><page sequence="17">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 181 intellectual advisor. Ibn al-jawzl has repeatedly acknowledged his immense debt to Ibn Näsir, describing in his mashyakha the strong relationship he had with him and saying, "he is the one who took charge of teaching me hadith since the time of childhood [...] and it is from him that I have learnt most of what I know of the science of hadithP3 Moreover, in the entry on Ibn Näsir in Ibn al-'Imäd's Shadharät al-dhahab, Ibn al-jawzl is quoted praising his men tor and saying that he benefited from no one else like he benefited from him (wa-lam astafid min ahadin ka-stifadati minhu).M Ibn Näsir was incidentally also the maternal uncle of Ibn al-jawzl, and even though Ibn al-jawzl did not explicitly refer to this blood relationship to explain his attachment to his men tor, many references in his writings seem to indicate that he found affinity with his maternal kin who included many religious scholars over more than one generation much more so than with his paternal kin who had been exclu sively (but successfully) involved in commerce.35 Thus, it is natural, if al-Samänl criticized and attacked Ibn Näsir, that Ibn al-jawzl would have risen to the defence of his uncle and mentor and lashed out at al-Samänl, the source of the criticism. Merlin Swartz, who among modern scholars is the most noted expert on Ibn al-jawzl, mentions that "Ibn Näsir's reputation as a scholar rested largely on his mastery of that special branch of baditb known as al-jarh wa-l-tadil (criticism of authorities)" and that "his thorough and relentless criticism ol authorities, however, earned him censure from several of his contemporaries, the most important of whom was Sam'änI."36 One assumes that Swartz based his statement partially on Ibn al-Jawzl's own accusation of al-Sam'änl, so let us examine this accusation to uncover how Ibn al-jawzl waged his attack on al-Sam'änl and perhaps to see what else may lie behind it. Ibn al-Jawzl's attack on al-Sam änl was done both in the obituary devoted to Ibn Näsir under the year 550/1155 in his Muntazam and repeated in the obituary for al-Sam'änl erroneously included under the year 563/1167-8 in 33 Ibn al-jawzl, Mashyakhat Ibn al-Jawzi, taqdim wa-tahqiq Muhammad Mahfüz (Athinä/ Bayrüt: Dar al-Gharb al-Isläml, 1980), 129. 34 Ibn al-'Imäd, Shadharät al-dhahabfi akhbär man dhahab, ashrafa 'alä tahqlqih wa-kharraja ahädlthah 'Abd al-Qädir Arnaüt, haqqaqah wa-'allaqa alayh Mahmüd Arnä'üt (Dimashq/ Bayrüt: Dar Ibn Kathlr, 1986-1993), 6:257.

In the first entry, Ibn al-jawzl acknowledges his debt to his master and defends him against al-Sam'änl's alleged accusation that "he loved to slander people" (Ar. kän yuhibb an yaqa fi l-näs), ascertaining that all that Ibn Näsir did was perform al-jarh wa-l-tadil and that al-Sam'äni by accusing him of maliciously defaming people proves that he himself is not a good hadith transmitter. Moreover, Ibn al-jawzl ventures to explain al- Sam'änl's alleged attacks on Ibn Näsir, adding: But this can be attributed to the prejudice of al-Sam'äni against the followers of Ahmad (i.e., the Hanballs). Anyone reading his books would see for himself his distasteful prejudice. And his mal-intention certainly comes from the fact that he had not benefited from what he heard (of hadith), and never reached the rank of reporting hadith (wa-lä balagh martabat al-riwdya), and died (ukhidh) before he could ever reach his ambition (of becoming a hadith reporter). May God help us from mal-intention and prejudice.37 Ibn al-Jawzi's disparagement of al-Sam'änl does not stop at that and is much more elaborately developed in the obituary he included for him in al-Muntazam. Although obituaries don't generally dwell on the negative traits of the deceased, that of al-Sam'änl seems to focus on that alone. 1 include below a translation of that entry that may give a sense of the dismissive attitude Ibn al-jawzl had towards his older contemporary: Abd al-Karim b. Muhammad b. Mansür Abu Sad al-SarrTänl. He came to Baghdad in the year thirty-two (i.e. 532) and heard with us from the teachers. He travelled in search of hadith. He wrote a supplement (dhayl) to the History of Baghdad, after some of the supplement had already been written by Shujä al-Dhuhli and the obituaries of the teachers had been collected by Abu 1-Fadl b. Khayrün. So he [i.e., al-Sam'äni] (only) gathered those. He quenched his thirst from (studying with) our teachers, such as Abd al-Wahhäb and Muhammad b. Näsir and the rest of the teachers who are worthy of being mentioned, all the way from the time of al-Khatlb up to his own time. He was however prejudiced against the school (madhhab) of Ahmad (b. Hanbal), and excessively so. He mentioned a group of our friends and maligned them in matters for which they should not be maligned. For example, as in saying about Abd al-Qädir that he used to give his class al-mushastaka,w when the man had an eye disease, and saying about Ibn Näsir that he liked to malign people, this after having taken most of his book from him, and having supported his claim by the latter's use of hadith criticism {al-jarh wa-l-tddil). In doing so, he [i.e., al-Sam'äni] has degraded himself (azrä aid nafsih) in what he said about him (i.e., about Ibn Näsir) in the matter of 37 Ibn al-jawzl, al-Muntazam, 18:103-4. 38 This word may be a corruption in the text; I was unable to find a meaning for it in any of the lexicons I have consulted.</page><page sequence="19">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 183 hadith criticism, when he should have uttered nothing about him. Rather he should have said that he (i.e., Ibn Näsir) disparaged someone, not maligning him in any way. For what would a hadith scholar do besides hadith criticism? Anyone who considers this (kind of criticism) to be blameworthy maligning does not know the discipline. This Abu Sad [i.e., al-Sam anl] vented his anger in his book with such meaningless matters. As a result he could not publish it because of his ill intention and died before attaining his hope. If a researcher were to seek out the mistakes that are found in his book, like confused genealogies and death dates of people who are still alive, and other such mistakes, he would gather together much material. But time is much more precious than to be wasted on such mat ters. This man resorted to remarkable mashqaa,39 for he would take the elder Baghdädi man and sit with him over the "Isä river, and say so and so reported (a hadith) to me from Transoxania {min ward' al-nahr), or sit with him in the Raqqa of Baghdad, and say so and so reported to me while in Raqqa, and all such matters that cannot elude hadith scholars.40 He also made mistakes out of ignorance as when he would say in the biography of a person that he was of good posture (hasan al-qäma), when such expressions are not used by people of hadith for praise. He also said of an old woman, with whom he read some hadith, that she was from a house of hadith scholars, her father a hadith reporter, her husband a hadith reporter, and had reached the age of seventy or more, and then say that she was chaste. Such speech is not the speech of someone who knows the manner of hadith criticism. He mentioned in the biography of Ibn al-Sayfl the poet, that he was the impudent/lewd one (al-majjän) of Baghdad who is called the Bad Fix (al-hays bays), and whose sister is called He-Went-In-and-Out (dakhal wa-kharaj). No sane man would mention such things, and we do not see why we should elaborate further on such ugliness. Ibn al-Sam'äni died in his hometown, in this year (meaning 563), and the report of his death has reached us in Baghdad.41 It is evident from both these entries that Ibn al-jawzl did not mince his words, and portrayed al-Sam'änl in rather uncompromising terms: al-Sam'äni is pre sented as an ignoramus and a bad hadith scholar. He is also a man who made no real scholarly contributions, for his two most famous achievements, the authoring of al-Dhayl aid ta'rikh Baghdad and of the dictionary of hadith authorities entitled Kitdh al-Ansdb, were both mostly the work of other people 33 This is in my opinion another corruption in the text; My guess is that the original word may have been mashaqqa meaning harship/labor/great troubles and, if so, may have been meant sarcastically on the part of Ibn al-jawzl as in saying that al-Sam'äni went into incredible hardship to say stupid things and to fool his readers such as the litany of accusations that he went on to include in his listing. 40 Despite Ibn al-jawzl's allegations, there is no reason to doubt that al-Sam'äni went to Syria and therefore could have been to Raqqa in Syria. Ibn Asäkir's biography of al-Sam'äni provides plenty of evidence in this regard, in Ibn 'Asäkir, Ta'rikh Dimashq, 38:317-8. In the same entry, Ibn 'Asäkir also mentions al-Sam'äni's travels to Transoxania, although he himself was no witness to that. 41 Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Muntazam, 18:178-9.</page><page sequence="20">184 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 that al-Sam änl took credit for. Such claims are serious and are obviously intended to discredit the religious and scholarly authority of a man whom many others viewed in glowing terms. It is unlikely that all the accusations made by Ibn al-jawzl against al-Sam'äni were completely invented; yet, what is not clear is whether they were taken out of context and exaggerated in order to sully al-Sam'änl's reputation, for an examination of al-Sam'änl's entry on Ibn Näsir, at least in his Kitäb al-Ansäb, reveals no attack on Ibn al-Jawzl's mentor. Although the entry is not overly long or gushy, in it, al-Sam'äni refers to Ibn Näsir as "our teacher" (shaykhunä), calls him "the häfiz of Baghdäd in his time" (häfiz Baghdad fi 'asrih) and acknowledges his own indebtedness to him. A quick translation of the entry, as it appears in Kitäb al-Ansäb, will show that, at least in what survives of al-Sam'änl's written work, al-Sam'äni did not disparage or attack Ibn Näsir, for what he says about Ibn Näsir is not substantially different from the way Ibn al-jawzl describes his mentor in his own rnashyakha.n The entry on Ibn Näsir as it appears in Kitäb al-Ansäb reads as follows: Our teacher (shaykhuna) Abü 1-Fadl Muhammad b. Näsir b. Muhammad b. All al-Baghdädl al-hdfiz. He would write by himself (about himself): of Persian ori gin, of Salami birth and residence.43 He was the hdfiz of Baghdad during his time. He was knowledgeable about the contents and chains of transmissions of badiths. He heard/studied with Abu 1-Qäsim Ali b. Ahmad b. al-Busrl, Abü Tähir Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abi 1-Saqr al-Anbäri, Abü Muhammad Rizq Allah b. Abd al-Wahhäb al-Tamlmi, Abü 1-Husayn 'Asim b. al-Hasan al-'Asimi and others after them. I wrote much from him (katabtu 'anhu l-kathir) and studied under him (qaratu 'alayh) in Baghdad. His birth was in the 460's [in 467 or 8] (fi sanat nayyif wa sittin [immd sanat sab' or thamdninY'' wa-arba'i mi'a) and he died in Sha'bän of the year 550 in Baghdad, and was buried in Bab Harb next to the tomb of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. May God have mercy on him.45 Al-Sam änl may have indeed not always seen eye to eye with Ibn Näsir and probably occasionally criticized him, and this would have no doubt angered the latter's loyal student. And if al-Sam'änl indeed harbored any anti-Hanball feelings, the fact that Ibn Näsir had left the Shäfi'l fold to join the Hanball 42 See Ibn al-jawzl, Mashyakhat Ibn al-Jawzi, 126-9. 43 al-Saläml is a reference, in the case of Ibn Näsir and many others, to Madinat al-Saläm Baghdad, in al-Sam'änl, Kitäb al-Ansäb., 3:374. 44 The years seven or eight are specified in The Kitäb al-Ansäb ofAbd al-Karim ibn Muhammad al-Samänl, reproduced in facsimile from the manuscript in the British Museum, Add. 23355, with an introduction by D.S.

Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 185 madhhab may have bothered him and kindled further his taassub against him. Yet, all this remains somewhat theoretical for this taassub, if indeed it existed, is not really that evident in al-Sam'änl's written work, and certainly not in his most important work in which he assesses all eastern traditionists up to his time. Now, it is true that not all of al-Sam'änl's writings survived the Mongol sack of Marw and Baghdad or generally the vicissitude of later days: his al-Tahbir ft l-mujam al-kabir, only partially survives and the extant part (although including the Muhammads) has no entry on Ibn Näsir;46 his Dhayl 'aid ta'rikh Baghdad, which presumably was biographically-organized like al-Baghdädl's original, does not seem to have made it except through excerpts that survived in some later works; while other works such as Wafayät al-muta'akhkhirin min al-ruwät did not survive at all.47 Moreover, whereas al-Sam'änl's Mujam al-shuyükh did not survive, there is no entry on Ibn Näsir in his surviving al-Muntakhab min mujam shuyükh al-Samäni, which was al-Sam'änl's own abridgment of the larger mu jam.^ However, the fact that Muhammad Ibn Näsir has no entry in either al-Tahbir fi l-mu'jam al-kabir or in al-Muntakhab min mujam shuyükh al-Samäni is by itself significant, as it may have been the way al-Sam'änl dismissed Ibn Näsir's importance; but by the same token neither work could have also been the source of the criticism that Ibn al-jawzl held against al-Sam'änl. Nevertheless, it is clear that some of the works that did not survive may have included some criticism of Ibn Näsir. Indeed al-Dhahabl, in the entry on Ibn Näsir in his Tadhkirat al-huffäz, defended al-Sam'änl against the attacks that Ibn al-jawzl waged against him on account of Ibn Näsir, quoting in the process (though without indicating the exact source), the words that al-Sam'änl had allegedly used to describe Ibn Näsir. According to al-Dhahabl, al-Sam'äni had indeed said of Ibn Näsir, yuhibb an yaqa fi l-näs, but he had said so as part of an interjectory remark introduced by ghayr annah (but he) in the context of addressing one fault of Ibn Näsirs in what was otherwise an overall positive portrayal of him. Al-Dhahabi went on, in his defence of his fellow Shäfi'i, al-Sam'änl, to attack Ibn al-jawzl and his master saying that Ibn Näsir had indeed been very harsh in his taassub-motivated attacks on some teachers (Id rayba anna Ibn Näsir 46 See al-Sam'änl, al-Tahbir fl l-mujam al-kabir, tahqiq Munlra Näjl Sälim (Baghdad: Matba'at al-Irshäd, 1975). 47 EI2, s.v. "al-Sam'änl," (R. Sellheim). 48 See al-Sam'änl, al-Muntakhab min mujam sbuyükh al-Sam'äni, tahqiq Muhammad 'Uthmän (al-Qähira: Maktabat al-Thaqäfa al-Dlniyya, 2008). This muntakhab includes entries on 1,445 shaykh of the presumably close to seven thousand teachers that al-Samanl claims to have studied with or related from.</page><page sequence="22">186 M.

After all, one assumes that Kitäb al-Ansäb, al-Sam'änls magnum opus, would have been the natural vehicle for an attack on Ibn Näsir, if al-Sam'änl had really intended to seriously disparage the man. But, as I have shown, it includes no hint of negativity towards the man. So, then why did Ibn al-jawzl take al-Samänl's statement so strongly to heart and move on to have such a negative assessment of him? I would like to suggest in what follows that this assessment is perhaps only partially motivated by Ibn al-jawzl's defence of his beloved mentor or by the Shäfi'i-Hanball rivalry of the day, and that much more personal motivations may have coloured Ibn al-Jawzfs feelings towards al-Sam'änl. Some attention to Ibn al-jawzl's own career may therefore be necessary to try to better eluci date the context of his criticism. Ibn al-jawzl was born in Baghdad some time between 508/1114 and 513/1120 and died there in 597/1201.50 His life therefore spanned almost the whole of the sixth/twelfth century, and he was one of the most famous and successful Hanbali preachers and homilists operating in Baghdad during the greater part of this period.51 He was also a most prolific author, and perhaps the most prolific author in the Arab world, with upwards of 1,000 works deal ing with the full spectrum of religious and literary disciplines of his time 45 al-Dhahabi, Tadhkirat al-huffäz, 1289-90. 50 Different biographical sources list different dates of birth, the earliest listed being 508/114 and the latest being 513/1120. 51 On the art of the homily in medieval Islam as exemplified by Ibn al-Jawzi's work, see Merlin Swartz, "Arabic Rhetoric and the Art of the Homily in Medieval Islam," in Religion and Culture in Medieval Islam, ed.

Of the many works that have survived, more than thirty have been edited and made available to help us understand his thought and times.55 Throughout his extant work, as is observed by Daniel Reig with regards to Sayd, al-khätir, the personality of Ibn al-jawzl shines through as that of an individual whose main trait of character is "the need, evident everywhere, to attain wisdom and lead others to it".56 In fact, Ibn al-jawzl seems to have highly valued his role as a saviour of souls and speaks proudly in some of his writings of the thousands who attended his preaching sessions, and of the many depraved young men who heeded his admonitions and changed their ways upon hearing his sermons, and even of the many non-Muslims who 52 Ibn Taymiyya is quoted claiming that he had counted the works of Ibn al-Jawzi and found them to be more than a thousand, and later fell upon others that he had not counted before, in Ibn Rajab, al-Dbayl 'aid tabaqät al-Hanäbik, waqafa 'alä tab'ih wa-sahhahah Muhammad Hamid al-Faql (al-Qähira: al-Matba'a al-Muhammadiyya, 1952), 1:415. This is no doubt an exaggera tion on the part of Ibn Taymiyya, whereby the large round number is meant to convey the immensity of Ibn al-jawzl's achievement. The symbolism of numbers in the Islamic tradition has been addressed by Lawrence Conrad in L. Conrad, "Seven and the Tasbi'-. On the Implications of Numerical Symbolism for the Study of Medieval Islamic History," Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient 31 (1988): 42-73. 53 For a slightly outdated but still useful bibliographic study of Ibn al-Jawzi, see al-'Alwajl, Mu'allafät Ibn al-Jawzi (al-Kuwayt: Jam'iyat Ihyä' al-Turäth al-Isläml, Markaz al-Makhtütät wa-l-Turäth wa-l-Wathä'iq, 1992). Al-'Alwajl puts the number of Ibn al-Jawzi's works at 519, though modern scholars have since then uncovered a few other works unaccounted for by al-'Alwajl. 54 See the two-page long list of criticisms waged by some against him and reproduced by his fellow Hanball in Ibn Rajab, al-Dhayl 'alä tabaqät al-Hanäbila, 1:414-5. No doubt, some of these criticisms betray intra-Hanball disagreements, yet some seem to focus primarily on his character, and the quality (or lack thereof) of his work more so than the theological standpoints that he advocated. More on this further below. 55 Al-'Alwajl cites thirty works that were in print at the time when he published his bibliog raphy (al-'Alwajl, Mu allafdt Ibn al-Jawzi, 204-5), but a few others have also appeared since then, such as some of the works translated and/or edited by M.

Yazigi / Oriens39 (2011) 165-198 converted to Islam following his preaching.17 His sermons supposedly attracted large crowds, estimated by him, at times, at fifty thousand, at a hundred thou sand, and once even at three hundred thousand.58 Although, these numbers may have included a certain degree of self-congratulatory embellishment, the great popularity of Ibn al-jawzl's preaching sessions is independently con firmed by the Andalusian traveler Ibn Jubayr who attended three of Ibn al-jawzl's sermons during his visit to Baghdad in 580/1184.59 In his descrip tion, Ibn Jubayr marveled at Ibn al-jawzl's skills as a homilist, describing him as being "the wonder of all time", and his discourse as "brilliant and superb"; he also remarked on the attraction of the masses to his sessions and the visible effect that his preaching had on them. Yet, despite his great infatuation with Ibn al-jawzl's performance, his description of all three sessions conveys the emotive response of those present but fails to convey an estimate of what may have been the size of the audience in each instance.60 Nevertheless, as noted by al-Dhahabl, numbers such a hundred thousand and more are unrealistic and could not have been true as such [wa-lä rayba anna hädhä mä waqa'a), for he remarks, that if things had occurred the way Ibn al-jawzl had described, his 57 See Ibn al-jawzl, Laftat al-kabid, 37, where Ibn al-jawzl brags about his achievements, mentioning the repentance of more than one hundred thousand sinners and the conversion of two hundred dhimmis as a result of his preaching. See more such bragging in Ibn al-jawzl, al-Muntazam, 18:250. 58 See M. Swartz, "The Rules of the Popular", 232. In his al-Muntazam, Ibn al-Jawzi specifi cally mentions a number of his wa'z sessions that were very well attended, estimating his audi ence in Safar 542/1147 at ulüflä yuhsawn (,al-Muntazam, 18:55), in Muharram 568/1172 at 100,000 (,al-Muntazam, 18:199), in Muharram 569/1173 again at 100,000 and at 300,000 in Rabf al-Awwal of the same year (al-Muntazam, 18:202-3), in Shawwäl 570/1175 at 50,000 (al-Muntazam, 18:215) and again at 100,000 in Jumäda al-ülä 574/1178 (al-Muntazam, 18:249). Note though that Ibn al-jawzl often used these large round numbers, and in particular one hundred thousand, whenever he wanted to indicate a very large attendance at an event, for 100,000 is also the number he cites for the funerary cortege of al-shaykh al-ajall Abü Mansür Ibn Yüsuf (in 460/1067), while 300,000 is the number he cites for that of the more problematic Hanball figure Ibn 'Aqil (513/1119), whom Ibn al-jawzl greatly admired, though the latter number was an estimate presumably provided to him by his teacher Ibn Näsir who had been present at the event (see al-Muntazam, 16:109 and 17:182). 59 On examples of overt Jawzlan self-congratulation, see for example, al-Muntazam, 18:213, where Ibn al-Jawzi congratulates himself on finishing a complete exegesis of the Quran in his majlis al-wa'z [md araft anna waiz fassar al-qur'dn kullah ft majlis al-waz)\ and al-Muntazam, 18:214, where he brags about the crowds and the important personalities that gathered to hear him give lessons upon taking over a new madrasa and the jealousies that this engendered (wa-kän yawm mashhüd lamyura mithlah wa-dakhal alä qulüb ahl al-madhhab ghamm azim [li-annahum hasadüni]).

They both also had to contend with many other preachers who operated on the Baghdad! scene, usually of Iranian provenance, espousing Shäfi'l legal tradition and Ash'arl theology and affiliated to and funded by the Seljukid militarily establishment. These were, according to Ibn al-jawzl, the less important rivals who are summarily and individually dismissed by him in al-Muntazam and often labeled as mere qussäs (sing, qäss), and thus as sources of ignorance more so than anything else. Yet, they were rivals nevertheless as they shared the scene of action in which Ibn al-jawzl operated. Moreover, their presence points to the complex religio-political situation on the streets of Baghdad, and the strong ties that bound religion and politics in fifth/eleventh and sixth/twelfth century Baghdad.62 This is perhaps why Ibn al-jawzl valued even more his work as a waiz as he saw his role as a homilist exhorting the Hanball masses and inflaming their allegiances towards the caliphal establish ment as vital for the survival of the caliphate of Baghdad, and therefore for the upholding of the sunna that remained symbolically tied to the person of the caliph and the institution of the caliphate as a whole. And therefore, at the height of his career as he encountered success in attracting masses of support ers to his preaching sessions that were often funded or facilitated by the caliphal establishment and oftentimes attended by the caliph or his represen tatives, Ibn al-jawzl found himself propping the legitimacy of the caliphal establishment and in turn-through the caliphal endorsement and presence at some of his ivaz sessions-being supported by it. This reciprocal relationship as long as it lasted helped raise the profile of both among the masses and obvi ously gave Ibn al-jawzl a sense of self-importance that one can easily detect 61 al-Dhahabi, Siyar a'lam al-nubalä', 13:200. 62 On the mix of power, beliefs and politics on the Baghdad! scene as depicted in Ibn al-Jawzi's al-Muntazam, see Jacqueline Chabbi, "Figures de la scene Bagdadienne: Pouvoir, croyance et luttes partisanes aux V'/XIC et VT7XIF siecles d'apres la chronique bien ordonnee d'Ibn al-öawzi," in Paroles, Signes, Mytbes: Melanges Offerts ä Jamel Eddine Bencheikh, ed.

Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 through his works. 3 The reciprocal relationship between Ibn al-jawzl and the caliphal establishment also ensured for the caliph the continued support of the mostly indigenous Hanball populations of Baghdad in the face of the threat represented by the Turkish military establishment and the scholarly establishment-mostly of Iranian import and belonging to the Shäfi'l and Hanafl madhhabs-t\\ax it endorsed. So that after 549/1154 when the Seljukid hold on Baghdad became far more discreet, the caliphate under al-Muqtafl (and later on under his son al-Mustanjid) and the tight hold of the astute vizier Ibn Hubayra was able to re-establish some degree of political indepen dence and territorial control with a healthy dose of popular support, repre sented mostly by the Hanball populations of the city whose loyalty had been cultivated through the admonitions of Ibn al-jawzl and his fellow Hanball preachers.64 And even after the political fortunes of Baghdad! Hanbalism rela tively declined after 570/1174, the Hanballs remained as tolerated a madhhab as any other, but no longer treated with particular favour. Ibn al-jawzl never theless continued for a while to enjoy the support of the Treasurer Ibn Attär, and as a result remained for a while the most visibly successful Hanball preacher in the city, despite the gradual rift that set in between him and more mainstream Hanballs over some directions that he had come to advocate.65 63 See for example, al-Muntazam, 18:249, where following a number of favours that Caliph al-Mustadi' bi-lläh showed towards the Hanbalis, Ibn al-jawzl reported saying: "People began to say to me: this is because of you, for this madhhab did not gain esteem in the eyes of the ruler [i.e., the caliph] so that he became leaning towards the Hanbalis, except through hearing your words (ja'ala l-nds yaqülün Ii hädhä bi-sababika fa-innahü mä irtafaa hädhä l-madhhab 'ind al-sultän hattä mala ilä l-Hanäbila illä bi-sama kalämik). Later in the same year, he went on to brag that he had five madrasas under his control, adding "and this is something that the Hanbalis had not experienced except in my time" (wa-hädhä shay mä raähu l-Hanäbila illä ft zamänt), that he already had up until that day one hundred and thirty works to his name, and had man aged to gather in his waz sessions the caliph, the vizir, the treasurer and all the major 'ulamä' (,al-Muntazam, 18:249-50). 64 See RA. Mackay, "Patronage and Power in 6th/12th century Baghdad: the Life of the Vizier Adud al-Din Ibn al-Muzaffar," Studia Islamica 34 (1971): 27-56. 65 Ibn al-jawzl seems to have espoused views that, like Ibn Aqll's a few decades earlier, went against the dominant opinions within the Hanball madhhab of his day. For example, Ibn al-Jawzi's rather unorthodox take on the question of anthropomorphism, that is, his espousing of a metaphorical reading of the anthropomorphic descriptions of God in his Akhbär al-sifät, seems to have been the major point of contention between him and more conservative members of his madhhab (on this, see Merlin Swartz, A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism). He also seems to have been criticized for admiring Ibn Aqll and espousing some of his opinions that were deemed by some questionable or problematic (see Ibn Rajab, al-Dhayl 'aid tabaqät al-Hanäbila, 1:414). Moreover, in his refusal to defend Yazld's actions and in allowing the curs ing of Yazid he went against the opinion of Abd al-Muglth al-Hanball, one of his contempo raries, though not the most distinguished among them. On his disagreement with Abd</page><page sequence="27">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 191 Ibn al-jawzl's successful career in waz, as well as the role that his preaching played in strengthening Hanbalism and binding it to the caliphal institution in its period of frailty and need, may have given Ibn al-jawzl a slightly over inflated image of himself, perhaps perceiving himself as the saviour of the caliphate and of the sunna, and the most important Muslim figure of sixth/ twelfth-century Baghdad, if not of all of Iraq or the east. This resulted in his displaying an attitude of superiority over his contemporaries, and of contempt and disdain towards them. This attitude was remarked on by at least one later biographer who-although admiring Ibn al-jawzl's many qualities and vast knowledge-seems to have deemed his conceit ill placed and excessive. For Ibn Kathlr (d. 774/1373) does not hesitate to note this saying about Ibn al-jawzl: "He displayed pride, haughtiness in his persona, self-admiration and exalta tion beyond his rank" (käna fibi baha u&gt;a-taraffu fi nafsih, wa-i'jäb wa sumuwiv bi-nafsihi akthar min maqämih),66 adding that this was evident in his writings and in verses that he had composed and which Ibn Kathlr quoted in the biography.67 Ibn Rajab conveyed similar criticisms of Ibn al-Jawzi that point to the fact that his statements (presumably both oral and written) betray plenty of praise (here probably meaning self-praise or self-appreciation), pride and arrogance and an excess of pretensions (yüjad fi kalämihi min al-thana wa-l-taraffu wa-l-ta azurn wa-kathrat al-da awd).bi\ would like to also suggest that, due to his competitive nature and excessive pride, and perhaps also due to some degree of insecurity, Ibn al-jawzl may have also shown hostility towards those of his contemporaries who were well regarded and whom he may have deemed as potential competitors. Daniel Reig has already noted Ibn al-jawzl's combative nature,69 while Merlin Swartz has said of him that he "could be severely critical of those who differed with him or those who threat ened to steal the limelight [...] and capable of conniving to undercut oppo nents and tarnish their public persona."70 Al-Sam'änl would have definitely fallen within the category of rivals and competitors who may have threatened to steal Ibn al-jawzl's historical lime light. He hailed from Marw, a city in Khuräsän that experienced a great revival under the Seljuks and had come at least during the Seljuk period to supersede Baghdad on many levels as the thriving cultural and commercial centre in the al-Muglth, see Ibn al-jawzl, al-Radd 'aid l-muta'assib al-'anid al-mäni' min dhamm Yazid (Bayrüt: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 2005). 66 Emphasis mine. 67 Ibn Kathlr, al-Biddya wa-l-nihäya, 13:36. 68 Ibn Rajab, al-Dhayl'alä tabaqätal-Hanäbila, 1:414. 69 Ibn al-Jawzi, La Pensee Vigile, 13. 70 Swartz, A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism, 28.</page><page sequence="28">192 M.

He was universally well-regarded as a scholar and had travelled widely in his search for hadith, a matter that may have heightened Ibn al-Jawzl's inse curities given that he himself had done no travelling for the purpose of seeking of hadith and had been mostly bound to Baghdad throughout his career. There are hints in some of Ibn al-Jawzl's works which indicate that this may have been a sore point for him, as he often put down some of those who travelled widely in search of hadith or who portray themselves as having done so in their writings, as if to imply that they did so out of need or unnecessarily. In fact, in his advice to his son in Lafiat al-kabid, Ibn al-Jawzi congratulates himself on having spent all of his inheritance on buying books so that he never had to "degrade himself" in the search of ilm (mä dhulla abäka fi talab al-ilm qatt), as if to imply that the badge of honour worn by other hadith seekers was of no importance, and was merely a false claim to fame that only those financially incapable had to endure.72 Moreover, in his Talbis Iblis, Ibn al-jawzl used two of the examples he had utilized to disparage al-Sam'änl as a hadith scholar in his entry on him in the Muntazam to mock an unnamed shaykh from among the ash ab al-hadith. According to him, this shaykh came to us in Baghdad (dakhala ilaynä ilä Baghdad) and sat with a muhaddith in the Raqqa of Baghdad and then at the Nahr Isä and reported this in his writings in such a way as to fool people to think (li-yühim al-näs) that he had been to Syria and to Transoxania. Ibn al-jawzl derided this shaykh as well for constantly mentioning the reports he obtained over his various travels, as if to boast about the extent of his exertion in seeking hadith (li-yalam al-näs qadar taabih fi talab al-hadith).73 One could of course presume that Ibn al-jawzl was citing here a theoretical example that happens to parallel what he had mentioned about al-Sam'änl in the latter's obituary, but the end of that story in Talbis Iblis is quite telling. Ibn al-jawzl concluded it by saying about this shaykh that "he was not blessed and died while in the age of seeking" (fa-mä bürik lahü wa-mäta fi zamdn al-talab), implying that this was no theoretical example he was hypothetically putting forward, but that he had in mind and intended a specific individual with this description.74 The story about this shaykb is part of the section of Talbis Iblis entitled Dhikr talbis Iblis alä ashäb al-hadith, in which Ibn al-jawzl does not refrain from maligning many individuals who had been involved in hadith transmis 71 On the revival of the fortunes of Marw under the Seljuks, see EP, s.v. "Marw al-Shähidjän, (A. Yu. Yakubovskii — [C.E. Bosworth]). 72 Ibn al-jawzl, Lafiat al-kabid, 47. 73 Ibn al-Jawzi, Talbis Iblh (Bayrut: Dar al-Qalam, 1403/1982-3), 113. 74 Ibn al-Jawzi, Talbis Iblis, 113.</page><page sequence="29">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 193 sion while referring to them by name, though none of those explicitly cited were of the calibre of al-Sam'änl in fame. The fact that Ibn al-jawzl does not associate a name with this shaykh that he was criticizing is quite significant, and obviously makes the claim that this is a reference to al-Sam'änl circum stantial. However, the specific details pertaining to the shaykh that Ibn al-jawzl speaks of correspond in many ways to the biographical particulars of al-Sam'änl as Ibn al-jawzl had mentioned them elsewhere in his Muntazam. Unlike Ibn al-jawzl, al-Sam'änl was not from Baghdad but from Marw, and came into Baghdad as part of his seeking of knowledge. He did travel widely in search of hadith and died in middle age (and therefore slightly prematurely) while still fully engaged in his scholarly activities. Moreover, as mentioned, two of the main examples used by Ibn al-jawzl to criticize al-Sam'änl's scholarship are re-used here to criticize this shaykh's hadith scholarship, making it hard to believe that Ibn al-jawzl did not have al-Sam'änl in mind when penning this section of the Talbis Iblis. Since al-Muntazams coverage ends in 574/1179, before or right at the beginning of Ibn al-jawzl's progressive alienation from the Hanball school of Baghdad, estimated by scholars to have occurred "during the 570s and the 580s (from ca. 1174 to ca. 1193)",75 and in any case long before Ibn al-jawzl's fall from favour and his exile to Wäsit and house arrest there, it is fair to pre sume that when he was writing his entries in al-Muntazam in which he dispar aged al-Sam'anl, Ibn al-jawzl may not have foreseen the unfortunate turn of events that were to take place over the next two decades. He was still at the time, to use a common expression, "at the top of his game", and may have viewed the world from that vantage point, as witnessed by his excessive cover age of his own activities in the final years of his chronicle.76 Fuming at al-Sam änl for what he had said about Ibn Näsir, and believing or wanting to believe that he was superior to al-Sam'änl despite the latter's already well established reputation, Ibn al-jawzl lashed out at al-Sam'änl and attempted to discredit him on all grounds. Most importantly, it is obvious 75 Swartz, A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism, 23. 76 This excessive coverage was noted in Eric J. Hanne, Putting the Caliph in His Place: Power, Authority, and the Late Abhasid Caliphate (Madison and Teaneck: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2007), 47. Hanne provides two possible explanations for this phenomenon. According to him, it could be a means of self-preservation typical of medieval chroniclers covering events dur ing their own lifetime, as the fear of offending one of the many ruthless tyrants who may decide to exact revenge on him may have been a deterrent from dwelling too much on the political events of the day. Mackay also describes him as being "too careful of his own skin" (in P. Mackay, "Patronage and Power in 6th/12th century Baghdad": 30). However, Hanne does not discount Ibn al-jawzl's genuine preoccupation with his own "new-found prestige" (48) as a reason behind this increasing emphasis on his own activities in his chronicles coverage.</page><page sequence="30">194 M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 through reading the critique that Ibn al-jawzl made of al-Sam änl that he was very familiar with the latter's written work, the most important of which was the Kitäb al-Ansäb. If so, Ibn al-jawzl could not have missed in al-Sam'änl's introduction to this work the implicit claim of revivalism that al-Sam'änl was putting forward, and this may have particularly annoyed Ibn al-jawzl, the sell proclaimed saviour of the caliphate and of the sunna, who may have wished to make such claims of revivalism for himself Thus, familial, loyalty-based and madhhab-related factors may have been behind Ibn al-Jawzl's dislike of al-Sam'änl but personal desires of aggrandizement may have equally played a role in his attempts to totally discredit a very worthy scholarly rival as they vied for the title of revivalist ol their century in the relatively narrow confines of the sixth/twelfth century Islamic east. Conclusion Al-Sam'änl in his presentation of his Kitäb al-Ansdb, seemed to be consciously embarking on a communal reconciliatory venture and may have liked to be seen as the renewer of his own time: the man who resolved one of the pressing problems of the sixth/twelfth century. But al-Sam'änl was also conscious that few of the mujaddick of past times had openly made these claims for them selves but were generally recognized as such by their contemporaries and immediate successors. Thus a combination of tradition and false modesty did not allow him to claim the title of mujaddid for himself, but his insertion of the account about the earlier renewers in the introduction to his most important work is nevertheless quite indicative and was perhaps meant to be suggestive to all those who would approach his work. One is reminded of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's opening lines to his Confessions. There, too, the false modesty is nothing but a transparent pretence. Like Rousseau, who despite the many flaws that he did not hide in his Confessions, still saw himself better than his contemporaries and set out to write about it, al-Sam'änl may have seen his own work, in its alphabetical organization and broad criteria of inclusion, as surpassing that of his predecessors and contemporaries, and in its grand scheme and purpose superseding any of their attempts at communal reconciliation, renewal and invigoration. For even those among them who had attempted to resolve the rifts in the Muslim community, or at least to moderate the differences within it that were the result of the Arab/non-Arab cultural rivalries and both communities' differing bases of identification, had failed thus far to redefine the terms of discourse in any major way. Al-Sam'änl was going to do things differently in this work, and as such was</page><page sequence="31">M. Yazigi / Oriens 39 (2011) 165-198 195 projecting to earn the praise and honour previously associated with the afore mentioned mujaddids-, like them, he may have wanted to be seen as a com munal saviour and the work he was presenting was the tool he was using to achieve that goal. Yet, in presenting his work in such a manner, al-Sam äni was also challeng ing the potential claims of fellow contemporary medieval scholars who saw in their own work the potential salvation and renewal of their communities. Ibn al-jawzl, the most prolific author of the sixth/twelfth century, the homilist of his time, and the transformer and reformer of throngs of people, saw himself in a similar light. And even though historically more than one mujaddid has been recognized for any one century, it has rarely been the case that two indi viduals who lived in the same region and time were recognized simultaneously. Al-Sam'änl and Ibn al-jawzl were unfortunate to have operated in the gener ally same region and to have lived in the same century; thus, their rivalry, and perhaps one of the possible reasons behind Ibn al-Jawzi's inclement assessment of al-Sam'änl.
