<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton and the Apocalyptic By LELAND RYKEN I WHEN MILTON chose the story of the Fall for his epic, he at once faced the problem of portraying in human terms an action and setting which are not directly accessible to human experience. By presenting not only the fall of man but the entire celestial cycle-creation, the war in Heaven, the fall of man, and redemption-he further increased the proportion of supernatural and apocalyptic material in his narrative.' As a result, Para- dise Lost is concerned with the invisible more than any other poem in the language, and the poem is accurately described by the narrator as one which relates "invisible exploits" (V.565) and tells "Of things invisible to mortal sight" (1I1.55).2 The action of the poem is removed from ordinary human experience by its heavy reliance on supernatural agents, by the fact that the two human characters are unfallen through most of the epic,3 and by the fact that the events occur in the mythic world of prehistory, before human experience as we know it existed. Although any study of how Milton portrayed apocalyptic reality must ultimately be based on an analysis of the poem itself, a preliminary ques- tion which deserves attention is the matter of the theoretic considerations with which Milton approached his supernatural subject matter. An aware- ness of these theoretic aspects will provide a historical perspective for reading Paradise Lost and will suggest profitable critical approaches to the poem. In the discussion which follows I have attempted to reconstruct the elements of poetic theory and general philosophic outlook which Milton brought to bear on the problem of how to portray the apocalyptic in humanly comprehensible terms. The most important of these theoretic considerations is undoubtedly the theory of accommodation, but the strain of Platonism in Milton's poetic theory is also part of the background of the subject. 1 The term "apocalyptic" is used in the present discussion to refer to a realm of existence which transcends the world of ordinary human experience. I further use the word, in the sense suggested by Northrop Frye, to describe a world which is infinitely desirable and is thus at an opposite pole from the demonic world. In the present context "apocalyptic" reality would extend to Heaven and the Garden of Eden, and to the agents which move within these realms (God, the angels, and Adam and Eve). 2 All quotations from Milton have been taken from The Works of John Milton, ed. Frank Allen Patterson et al. (New York, 1931-38). 3 Milton's awareness of the difficulty of portraying perfect human beings is recorded in his plans for a drama on the topic of the Fall. In the prologue of the third draft, he has Moses tell the audience that they "cannot se Adam in the state of innocence by reason of thire sin"; see "Milton's Outlines for Tragedies," Works, XVIII, 229. 223</page><page sequence="2">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY II The so-called theory of accommodation was one of the commonplaces of medieval and Renaissance theology. While statements by individual writ- ers varied in details, the central point of the doctrine remained the same: the representation of God in Scripture has been accommodated to man's understanding by being reduced to language which human intelligence can comprehend. This method of biblical exegesis was designed to pro- vide an adequate explanation for the anthropomorphic portrayal of God in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. Although statements of the doctrine usually centered on the representation of God, the implica- tions of the theory were often extended to scriptural truth in general, with the result that spiritual truths of any kind might be said to be accommo- dated in humanly understandable terms. This principle of biblical interpretation had been stated definitively as early as Augustine. In commenting on an Old Testament passage which speaks of God's anger, Augustine explains, "The anger of God is not a disturbing emotion of His mind, but a judgment by which punishment is inflicted upon sin. His thought and reconsideration also are the unchange- able reason which changes things; for He does not, like man, repent of anything He has done.... But if Scripture were not to use such expres- sions as the above, it would not familiarly insinuate itself into the minds of all classes of men, whom it seeks access to for their good ... ; and this it could not do, did it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they lie."4 This doctrine was formulated by theologians of the Renaissance as well as the Middle Ages. An example of a Renaissance restatement of the con- cept is that by John Colet, founder of St. Paul's School, where Milton himself was later to receive his early education. Colet touches upon the subject repeatedly in his discussion of the Mosaic account of creation in his four "Letters to Radulphus." Moses describes the creation, writes Colet, "placing before the eye the arrangement of the world; which he does in this way ... that he may seem to have regard to the understand- ing of the vulgar and rude multitude whom he taught." Again, "So all things of God, when given to man, must needs lose somewhat-of their sublimity, and be put in a form more palpable and more within the grasp of man. Accordingly, the high knowledge of Moses about God and Divine things and the creation of the world, when it came to be submitted to the vulgar apprehension, savoured altogether of the humble and the rustic .... Thus, accommodating himself to their comprehension, Moses en- deavoured, by this most honest and pious poetic figure, at once to allure them and draw them on to the worship of God."15 4 The City of God, trans.

The pronouncements of Calvin are of particular interest because of his influence on the Protestant tradition in which Mil- ton wrote. In commenting on the anthropomorphism of Isaiah vi. 1-5, Calvin writes, "we may ask how Isaiah could see God who is spirit and is therefore not visible to bodily eyes. Since the minds of men are incapable of mounting to the infinite height of God, how can man apprehend God under any visible form? But we must realize that whenever God revealed himself to be seen by the fathers, he never appeared as he is in himself but as he could be understood by human minds.... Therefore Isaiah has shown a form of a kind which enabled him with his own understanding to taste the inconceivable majesty of God. This is the reason that he attri- butes a throne, a robe, and a bodily appearance to God."6 Unlike Colet, who stresses the social and intellectual incapacities of those who receive accommodated spiritual truths, Calvin places the necessity of such accom- modation in the universal human condition, without regard to distinc- tions of class or mental ability: "By this means he [i.e., God] has consider- ation upon our weakness. For if we were wholly spiritual like the angels, we should be able to see both him and his gifts. But as we are surrounded by this gross earthly body, we need symbols or mirrors, to exhibit to us the appearance of spiritual and heavenly things in a kind of earthly way."7 Calvin's formulation of the principle also evinces his Reformed theology in its emphasis on the fact that man should rest content with the represen- tation which God has given of himself and should refrain from allegorical or mystical interpretations of the Bible. God has given us, he writes, "a description, not of what he is in himself, but of what he is to us, that our knowledge of him may consist rather in a lively perception than in vain and airy speculation."8 Statements of the theory of accommodation were not limited to theolo- gians but were voiced by poets and men of letters as well. Dante makes poetic use of the concept in the Paradiso, where Beatrice explains to the poet, So Scripture stoops to your intelligence: 6 Calvin: Commentaries, trans. and ed. Joseph Haroutunian (Philadelphia, 1958), p. 120. Other statements of the theory of accommodation can be found in Calvin's comments on Gen. iii.8, Ex. iii.2, 4, and Ez. ix.3-4. All of these passages are conveniently quoted by Edward A. Dowey, Jr., The Knowledge of God in Calvin's Theology (New York, 1952), pp. 3-5. 7 Theological Treatises, trans. and ed.J. K. S. Reid (Philadelphia, 1954), p. 131. 8 Institutes of the Christian Religion, I, trans. John Allen (Philadelphia, 1930), 95. Another statement of the doctrine occurs in the same chapter, p. 99. For details on the Protestant tra- dition of literal as opposed to allegorical biblical exegesis see Frederic W. Farrar, History of Interpretation (London, 1886), and Henry Preserved Smith, Essays in Biblical Interpretation (Boston, 1921). Milton's adherence to the Protestant tradition is noted by George Newton Conklin, Biblical Criticism and Heresy in Milton (New York, 1949), p. 10. 225</page><page sequence="4">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY It talks about God's 'hand' and 'feet, intending That you should draw a different inference....9 A seventeenth-century instance is John Dryden, who, in discussing "Hero- ic Poetry and Poetic Licence," writes as follows: "For immaterial sub- stances, we are authorized by Scripture in their description: and herein the text accommodates itself to vulgar apprehension, in giving angels the likeness of beautiful young men. Thus, after the pagan divinity, has Homer drawn his gods with human faces: and thus we have notions of things above us, by describing them like other beings more within our knowledge."'10 Dryden's statement of the theory is particularly significant because of its indication of the facility with which the doctrine of accom- modation was transferred from the area of biblical exegesis to that of poet- ic theory and practice. It is also interesting to observe that Dryden's re- marks appear in an essay prefixed to his dramatic adaptation of Milton's epic, The State of Innocence. As the foregoing examples demonstrate, the concept of the accommo- dation of spiritual truth to human understanding was a commonplace to anyone familiar with current notions of scriptural interpretation in the Renaissance." Milton, a theologian in his own right, clearly shows his knowledge and acceptance of this tradition in Chapter ii of the De Doc- trina Christiana. He begins by asserting axiomatically that man is incap- able of perfect comprehension of the Deity. "When we speak of knowing God," he writes, "it must be understood with reference to the imperfect comprehension of man; for to know God as he really is, far transcends the powers of man's thoughts, much more of his perception.. ." (Works, XIV, 31). As a result of man's limited understanding, he is dependent for his conception of God on the revelation which God has given of himself: 9 Paradiso IV. 43-45; The Comedy of Dante Alighieri the Floretitine, trans. Dorothy L. Sayers (New York, 1962). 10 OJfDramatic Poesy and Other Critical Essays, I, ed. George Watson (London, 1962), 204. The persistence with which the theory of accommodation appeared in literary contexts is suggested further by the following note which Pope attached to a passage in Bk. VIII of the Iliad: "there are some Places in Scripture that in Compliance to human Understanding rep- resent the Deity as acting by Motives like those of Men." 11 The currency of the theory of accommodation in the Middle Ages and Renaissance is established more fully in several studies. C. A. Patrides, "Paradise Lost and the Theory of Accommodation," TSLL, V (i963), 58.63, quotes a total of 8 Renaissance statements of the theory and lists 5 additional sources. The same writer offers the most complete bibliography to date of Renaissance references to the theory of accommodation in Milton and the Chris- tian Tradition (Oxford, 1966), pp. 9-1o. Roland M. Frye, God, Man, and Satan (Princeton, 1960), pp. 9-13, quotes and discusses parallel passages from Aquinas, Calvin, Athanasius, and Knox. H. R. MacCallum, "Milton and Figurative Interpretation of the Bible," UTQ, XXXI (1961i62), 397-415, notes examples from Colet and Spinoza and makes significant and percep- tive comments on Milton's formulation of the doctrine. Basil Willey, The Seventeenth Cen- tury Background (London, 1942), has a chapter "On Scriptural Interpretation" (pp. 57-75), which includes a discussion of the theory of accommodation. 226</page><page sequence="5">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC "No one. . . can have right thoughts of God, with nature or reason alone as his guide, independent of the word, or message of God.... God there- fore has made as full a revelation of himself as our minds can conceive, or the weakness of our nature can bear" (XIV, 31). In Milton's view, then, the theory of accommodation is rooted in man's dependence upon divine revelation for his knowledge of spiritual truths. Man's proper response to God's revelation of himself is to receive the accommodated truth as it has been given to him and to allow his concep- tion of God to be formed by the details which he finds in Scripture. As Milton states, "Our safest way is to form in our minds such a conception of God, as shall correspond with his own delineation and representation of himself in the sacred writings. For granting that both in the literal and figurative descriptions of God, he is exhibited not as he really is, but in such a manner as may be within the scope of our comprehensions, yet we ought to entertain such a conception of him, as he, in condescending to accommodate himself to our capacities, has shown that he desires we should conceive" (XIV, 31, 33). In accepting the principle of accommodation, Milton is logically led to affirm the validity of an anthropomorphic picture of God. In regard to the outward appearance and form of God, for example, "If God be said 'to have made man in his own image, after his likeness,' Gen.i.26. and that too not only as to his soul, but also as to his outward form ... and if God habitually assign to himself the members and form of man, why should we be afraid of attributing to him what he attributes to himself, so long as what is imperfection and weakness when viewed in reference to our- selves be considered as most complete and excellent when imputed to God?" (XIV, 35). Not only human form, but human emotions and actions as well are a legitimate part of our conception of God. Thus "if after the work of six days it be said of God that 'he rested and was refreshed,' Exod. xxxi. 17. if it be said that 'he feared the wrath of the enemy,' Deut. xxxii. 27, letus believe that it is not beneath thedignityof God to ... be refreshed in that which refresheth him, or to fear in that he feareth" (XIV, 33). Along with this acceptance of a humanized conception of the Deity, Milton exhibits a distrust of the anthropomorphism which he finds in classical literature. "There is no need then," he writes, "that theologians should have recourse here to what they call anthropopathy, a figure invent- ed by the grammarians to excuse the absurdities of the poets on the subject of the heathen divinities" (XIV, 33). The apparent contradiction results from a distinction which Milton wishes to make between human qualities which are attributed to God in Scripture and human qualities which are attached to him on the basis of man's own thinking and imagination. This distinction becomes clearer in his subsequent discussion, where he states, "It is better therefore to contemplate the Deity, and to conceive of him, 227</page><page sequence="6">H:UNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY not with refere-ice to human passions, that is, after the manner of men, who are never weary of forming subtle imaginations respecting him, but after the manner of Scripture, that is, in the way wherein God has offered himself to our contemplation" (XIV, 33). The point would seem to be an elaboration of the concept, mentioned earlier, that accommodation begins with God and his revelation.'2 Man's conception of God must therefore find its limits not in his unchecked imagination (which consti- tutes "anthropopathy") but in the scriptural revelation. Milton's discussion is not without a degree of uncertainty and ambi- guity. He is unwilling to state finally whether the representation of God in human terms is a literal or a figurative picture of the Deity. " In a word," he writes, "God either is, or is not, such as he represents himself to be. If he be really such, why should we think otherwise of him? If he be not such, on what authority do we say what God has not said?" (XIV, 37). Similarly, after insisting that man must rest content with the scriptural representa- tion of God in physical terms, Milton is quick to make the distinction that "in arguing thus, we do not say that God is in fashion like unto man in all his parts and members, but that as far as we are concerned to know, he is of that form which he attributes to himself in the sacred writings" (XIV, 37). As both passages reveal, Milton was unable to decide finally on the exact nature of the accommodated image.'3 As in the case of other writers on the subject, Milton's discussion of the doctrine of accommodation displays certain characteristics which distin- guish it from other statements of the concept. In the first place, as Mac- Callum has noted, Milton's acceptance of the anthropomorphic details of accommodated spiritual truth is unusually thoroughgoing (pp. 402-403). Comparison of Milton's version of the theory with other statements is instructive on this point. On the one hand, Milton's unhesitating accept- 12 T-his part of Milton's discussion is clarified if we remember that he is here writing in the mainstream of Reformed theology and wishes to underscore the main tenet of that tradition, namely that Scripture alone is the authoritative source for religious belief. Milton's careful distinctions in the paragraph under consideration correspond to the following statement by Calvin: "For, since the human mind is unable, through its imbecility, to attain any knowledge of God without the assistance of his sacred word, all mankind, except the Jews, as they sought God without the word, must necessarily have been wandering in vanity and error."-Instituttes, I, 75. In view of Milton's denunciation of accepting non-scriptural details concerning God as truth, the thesis that he regarded himself as adding to the revelation of God in writing Par- adise Lost has received more attention than it deserves. William J. Grace, "Orthodoxy and Aesthetic Method in Paradise Lost and the Divine Comnedy," CL, 1 (1949), 173-187, asserts but (loes not document that "Milton actually believed that he wvas adding historic details to the Scripttures." 13 Denis Saurat, in Miltont: Manl and Thinker (London, 1949), p. ioo, misrepresents the statements of both Milton and David Masson when he states that, since for Milton God is com- pletely unknowable, the accommodated image is only a figure and that "This is in no way, as Masson would have it, a proof of literal belief." Masson, The Life of Miltont, VI (London, i88o), 819, correctly observes that for Milton the biblical representatiotns "may or may not be figurative expressions." 228</page><page sequence="7">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC ance of the physical details employed by biblical writers to describe God removes him from the-allegorical view of accommodation. Dante's state- ment, for example, is made in the Catholic tradition of an allegorical, four- level method of biblical exegesis. He accordingly implies that it is incum- bent on the reader of Scripture to rise from the physical vehicle of the metaphor to the spiritual mystery which lies beyond the realm of concrete details: Scripture "talks about God's 'hand' and 'feet,' intending/ That you should draw a different inference...." Milton's emphasis resists such a movement from the physical picture to a more spiritual conceptualization. According to his view, man has no need to acquire any other idea of spiri- tual truth than that which God has accommodated to him. "For it is on this very account," he asserts, "that he has lowered himself to our level, lest in our flights above the reach of human understanding, and beyond the written word of Scripture, we should be tempted to indulge in vague cogitations and subtleties" (XIV, 33). To entertain any conceptions of God other than the concrete particulars which he has given to us is to "frustrate the purposes of God instead of rendering him submissive obe- dience" (XIV, 37). It is worthy of note that for Milton the anthropomor- phic representation of God cannot be taken lightly, as it might tend to be when interpreted allegorically.14 Indeed, the physical details are true in so far as man is enabled to know. Milton's emphasis on the literal interpretation of accommodated truth also differs from statements of the theory which stress the social and edu- cational incapacity of the recipients of spiritual revelation. John Colet, as we have seen, takes the position that the Mosaic account of creation was intended for "the vulgar and rude multitude." Accordingly, he is at pains to show that Moses, with his superior wisdom and insight into spiritual matters, did not have need of the same physical particulars with which he presented his story to the uninstructed people: "so that we perceive him to have spoken, not in keeping with his own intelligence, but so as to suit the conceptions of the multitude."115 Milton's formulation makes no such distinctions between social classes and levels of intelligence. In his view, human nature without exception is incapable of a complete understand- ing of spiritual matters, "for to know God as he really is, far transcends the power of man's thoughts, much more of his perception" (XIV, 31). Milton's statement of the doctrine thus defines the limits of human under- standing and asserts the necessity for resting content in the words and images of the Bible without attempting to penetrate behind them. In 14 For some early discussions of Milton's concept of accommodation which conclude too sweepingly that Milton did not take the literal details of the anthropomorphic portrayal of God seriously see Elbert N.

Nicolson, "Milton and the Conjectura Cabbalistica," PQ, VI (1927), 1-i8. 15 Selections from "Letters to Radulphus," trans. J. H. Lupton, A Life of John Colet (Lon- don, i887), p. 251. 229</page><page sequence="8">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY this regard he is similar to Calvin, who, as we have seen, also insists that man accept the physical details of the scriptural representation of God, "that our knowledge of him may consist rather in a lively perception than in vain and airy speculations." Yet Milton's very hesitation over the ques- tion of whether the physical representation of God is literal or figurative suggests a more materialistic attitude than that of Calvin, who states plain- ly that God "never appeared as he is in himself' and that he has given "a description, not of what he is in himself' (supra, fns. 6 and 8). Even in his age, Milton's version of the theory would seem to be remarkable in its emphasis on the physical aspect of accommodation. It is well to note that Milton's statement of the principle of accommo- dation is not as simple as a cursory reading of his discussion might suggest. Although we are enjoined to rest content with an easily grasped picture of divine truth, Milton would also insist that this picture be based on the details found in Scripture. By implication, one's conception of God will be more or less complete and accurate to the extent that his knowledge of the biblical account is full and correct. Moreover, the human attributes which are given to God in Scripture must be divested of some of their usual connotations before we can form a correct picture of the Deity. When we read that God repented himself, Milton states, "let us believe that it did repent him, only taking care to remember that what is called repentance when applied to God, does not arise from inadvertency, as in men" (XIV, 33, 35). Similarly, we should not hesitate to attribute human qualities to God, "so long as what is imperfection and weakness when viewed in reference to ourselves be considered as most complete and excellent when imputed to God" (XIV, 35). The point which Milton apparently wishes to make is that although it is wrong to add allegorical meanings to physical representations of God, some kind of subtracting process is necessary in order to divest the representation of inappropriate human associations.16 With Milton's use of the theory of accommodation in the area of scrip- tural interpretation thus established, the question which remains to be answered is whether the doctrine is equally applicable to matters of poetic theory and technique. Any conclusion which we make must be made in the absence of explicit pronouncement by Milton, and since there has 16 In view of Milton's insistence that when human qualities are attributed to God they must be divested of some of their usual connotations, serious objections should arise in regard to the thesis of Malcolm Ross that "Milton, writing as a bitter anti-royalist drew heavily on the royalist literary tradition" and that "a contradiction between the symbol and the idea was inevitable." Milton's Royalism: A Study of the Conflict of Symbol and Idea in the Poems (Ithaca, 1943), p. vii. Keeping in mind Milton's stipulation that "what is imperfection and weakness when viewed in reference to ourselves be considered as most complete and excellent when imputed to God," we are free to see that Milton could without contradiction use the royalist symbol to represent true spiritual perfection, despite the fact that he was hostile to the royalist image as it existed in the political situation in Englandl. 230</page><page sequence="9">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC been virtually unanimous agreement among modern critics that Milton utilized the doctrine of accommodation in the portrayal of the apocalyp- tic portions of his epic, it is perhaps salutary to be reminded that not all critics have agreed that the principle of accommodation is legitimately employed by poets. William Wilkie, writing in the middle of the eight- eenth century, was of the opinion that in the early ages of the church God "thought fit to accomodate himself, by such a piece of condescension, to the notions and apprehensions of his creatures: but it would be indecent in any man to use the same freedom, and do that for God, which he only has a right to do for himself. The author of Paradise Lost has offended notoriously in this respect; and, tho' no encomiums are too great for him as a poet, he is justly chargeable with impiety, for presuming to represent the Divine Nature, and the mysteries of religion, according to the narrow- ness of human prejudice."'17 Modern criticism has generally been of the contrary opinion,18 and there is abundant reason to conclude that Milton consciously used the theory of accommodation in presenting the supernatural scenes in Para- dise Lost. We have already noticed that poets such as Dante and Dryden found the theory congenial to their poetic technique. Dryden, moreover, uses the doctrine in what might be called a prescriptive manner ("For immaterial substances, we are authorised by Scripture in their descrip- tion"), implying that the method of Scripture serves as a kind of model for poets. He accordingly proceeds to apply the theory to a consideration of Homer's portrayal of the gods. The idea that the biblical method is applicable to epic poetry is reiterated by Dryden elsewhere. In arguing for the appropriateness of Christian machinery, he asserts that "Christian poets have not hitherto been acquainted with their own strength. If they had searched the Old Testament as they ought, they might there have found the machines which are proper for their work."'9 There is evidence in Paradise Lost that Milton likewise looked upon the concept of accommodation as a legitimate poetic method. The locus classicus is Raphael's statement in V. 571-574: 17 Preface to Epigoniad (Edinburgh, 1757); quoted in H. T. Swedenberg, Jr., The Theory of the Epic in England, I650-I800, Univ. of Calif. Pubs. in English, XV (1944), 294. A Critical Essay on the Epigoniad defends Milton's technique on grounds which had earlier been sug- gested by Addison and with which Milton would have agreed: "Milton, as Addison observes, has an awe upon him when he makes the Almighty speak; he forgets the decorations of poetry, and intirely confines himself to expressions of Scripture and the early fathers. And must the doctrine of the Scriptures be called the narrowness of human prejudice... ?" (Swedenberg, p. 295). 18 Statements affirming that Milton looked upon the theory of accommodation as a legiti- mate poetic principle include the following: Roland Frye, p. 14; Patrides, TSLL, V, 62; Wil- ley, p. 70; James Holly Hanford, A Milton Handbook (New York, 1961), p. 205. 19 Of Dramatic Poesy .. ., ed. Watson, II, 88. 231</page><page sequence="10">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY and what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best .... Raphael concludes his account of the war in Heaven with a parallel allu- sion to the theory of accommodation: Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth At thy request, and that thou maist beware By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd What might have else to human Race bin hid .... (VI.893-896) Supplementing these statements are numerous other references to the accommodation of spiritual truth. In his account of Creation, for exam- ple, Raphael explains, Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Then time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receave. (VII.176-179) In describing the fight between Satan and Michael, Raphael again expres- ses the difficulty of finding an adequate earthly medium to convey the magnitude of the struggle: They ended parle, and both addrest for fight Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power .... (VI.296-3o1) The accommodated nature of anthropomorphic details is also suggest- ed in less obvious ways. When we are told that Satan wept "Tears such as Angels weep" (I.620), the qualifying phrase is a reminder by the narrator that the narrative exists on two planes and that the physical details are not true in exactly the ordinary way. When we read that the angels poured forth humor "such as Celestial Spirits may bleed" (VI.333), our attention is again directed to the fact that the action is being accommodated to our understanding. Adam's response to the story of the war in Heaven, expres- sing the feeling that Raphael has interpreted spiritual events which man could not with his own abilities have understood, likewise falls within the frame of reference provided by the doctrine of accommodation: 232</page><page sequence="11">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC Divine interpreter, by favour sent Down from the Empyrean to forewarne Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach.... (VII-72-75) In particular, Adam's designation of Raphael as a "divine interpreter" becomes meaningful only when we realize that the story which he has told has been translated into the language of human experience. In view of passages such as these, it would appear that the theory of accommodation constituted for Milton a basic premise underlying the portrayal of his apocalyptic vision. If this conclusion is correct, a context is provided for the apocalyptic elements in Paradise Lost and important critical implications follow. It is important to keep in mind that Milton's seventeenth-century reader would not have been surprised by the frank materialism in the description of spiritual events. The informed reader of Milton's day would not have been perplexed by the question which modern criticism finds so vexing, the question of how, if God is truly tran- scendent, he can "be expressed in finite terms, Spirit clothed in body and localized-even on a Throne in Heaven."20 For a reader acquainted with the doctrine of accommodation the answer to the question is simple: the transcendent God accommodates himself to human understanding in visible images, and it is therefore neither inconsistent nor contradictory to maintain that God is incomprehensible and at the same time to portray him in human terms. Such a demanding seventeenth-century reader as Dryden was not offended, as readers from the time of Samuel Johnson forward have been, at the mixture of spirit and matter in the account of the war in Heaven. Milton's contemporary readers were aware that Rapha- el's narrative was occurring at two levels, and that the poet could insist on the "otherness" of his story even while presenting the action in physical terms without being guilty of confusion or failure to make up his mind.21 Since Milton's poetic theory was based on the principle of accommo- dation, the reader must expect a preponderance of physical details in the apocalyptic parts of the narrative. Although the twentieth-century critic may find the theory of accommodation an unacceptable axiom from which to operate, it would seem fruitless to assail Milton for describing spiritual reality in earthly terms when that was precisely what he intended to do and what his theory bound him to. For Milton's age, at least, the theory 20 Marjorie Nicolson, John Milton: A Reader's Guide to His Poetry (New York, 1963), P. 223. The statement appears in a context of similar statements by other modern critics. 21 The charge of inconsistency on Milton's part is made by A. J. A. Waldock, Paradise Lost and Its Critics (Cambridge, Eng., 1962), pp. 109-1i1 1, and John Peter, in A Critique of Paradise Lost (New York, 1960), p. 22, asserts that "For poet and reader alike it is again chiefly a matter of indecision, of not knowing on what plane the poem's characters exist." 233</page><page sequence="12">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY provided the necessary equipment to read with sympathy and understand- ing a humanistic story about spiritual mysteries. Readers in succeeding generations who ignore the theory of accommodation run the risk of disqualifying themselves from an understanding of the poem. III The Platonic element underlying Milton's portrayal of apocalyptic reality is less pervasive and more problematical than the theory of accom- modation. The usual point of departure for discussing the Platonic aspect is the question raised by Raphael in his preface to the account of the war in Heaven. After stating the doctrine of accommodation, Raphael adds, though what if Earth Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? (V. 574-576) Raphael's suggestion that there may be an actual correspondence be- tween Heaven and Earth, "the shaddow of Heav'n," has been interpreted by most critics as a formulation of Plato's theory of Ideas.22 The prevalent view, however, has been formidably challenged by William G. Madsen, who has appealed to the typological method of biblical exegesis to ques- tion the relevance of the Platonic theory of Ideas to an interpretation of Paradise Lost.23 Taking Raphael's statement as his point of departure, Madsen argues that the material images used by Raphael to describe the war in Heaven "are typological and prophetic, not Platonic; they speak of what lies ahead, not what lies above." While Madsen's discussion adds a new dimension to our reading of Paradise Lost and supports a valid alter- nate or secondary interpretation of many passages in the poem, it seems to me that the emphasis of his typological approach is wrong. Passages in the poem make it clear that Raphael's narrative is concerned primarily with what lies above Earth in the scale of being, and that his statement about Earth as the shadow of Heaven must be understood in a Platonic context. It is important to note at the outset that Raphael's statement that Earth may be the shadow of Heaven occurs in answer to the specific problem of how to portray spiritual realities in terms which Adam can comprehend. 22 Critics who have interpreted Raphael's statement in the context of Renaissance Platonism include the following: Hanford, p. 205; Merritt Y. Hughes, John Milton: Complete Poems and Major Prose (New York, 1957), p. 315; M. M. Mahood, Poetry and Humanism (New Haven, 1950), p. 204; Irene Samuel, Plato and Milton (Ithaca, 1947), p. 145; George W. Whit- ing, Miltori's Literary Milieut (Chapel Hill, 1939), p. 31; andl Marjorie Nicolson, "The Spirit World of Milton and More," SP, XXII (1925), 451. 23 'Earth the Shadow of Heaven: Typological Symbolism in Paradise Lost," PMLA, LXXV (i (i6o), 519-526. 234</page><page sequence="13">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC The question, as raised by Raphael himself, is a matter of how to relate "To human sense th' invisible exploits/Of warring Spirits" (V.565-566), how to "unfould/The secrets of another world" (V.568-569). The imme- diate context of Raphael's statement, stressing different levels in the scale of being, thus points to a Platonic meaning, with its analogy between earthly and heavenly existence. Statements made later in the poem by Adam, Raphael, and the epic narrator likewise emphasize that the events in Heaven represent a differ- ent level of being than exists on Earth. Adam, for example, is of the opin- ion that the angel has described "Things above Earthly thought" (VII.82), things "which human knowledge could not reach" (VII.75). He tells Raphael, "Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, /Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd" (VII.70-7 1), a statement which can be interpreted only as concerned with different levels of being. When asking Raphael to move from the account of the war in Heaven to the story of the creation of the world, Adam again makes the point that Earth is lower in the scale of being than the celestial realm where the battle had transpired: "Deign to descend now lower, and relate ... / How first began this Heav'n which we behold" (VII.84,86). Both Raphael, the angelic narrator, and Milton, the epic narrator, also make it clear that the celestial parts of the narrative are concerned with a realm which lies above the earthly. Raphael states that his story is one which "surmounts the reach" of human understanding (V.571 ), and he complains of the difficulty of finding things "on Earth conspicuous, that may lift/Human imagination to such highth/Of Godlike Power" (VI. 299-301). Similarly, the acts of God, although accomplished instantaneous- ly, "to human ears/Cannot without process of speech be told,/So told as earthly notion can receave" (VII. 177-179). Milton, as epic narrator, speaks of the celestial battle as something which belongs to another world: Up Led by thee Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element .... (VII.12-i6) After relating the war in Heaven he will limit himself "Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;/Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole" (VII.22- 23). In the poem, then, there is rather clear evidence that the celestial parts of the narrative are concerned with actions which transcend human com- prehension. The repeated references to the strangeness and transcen- dence of the account must refer to a difference between two worlds, not 235</page><page sequence="14">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY between two separated points in time, for if the difference is only a tem- poral distinction, the account does not in fact deal with matter "Farr dif- fering from this World." The symbolism of the poem is thus primarily Platonic, telling of what lies above in the scale of being, and the fact that some of the events which transpire in Heaven foreshadow future events on Earth is of secondary importance. It is worthy of note in this regard that the clearest allusion to the typo- logical method in Paradise Lost, where Michael tells Adam about pro- ceeding "From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit" (XII.303), emphasizes the spiritual nature of the antitype as opposed to the physical nature of the type. Even if a typological interpretation of the battle in Heaven be allowed, the emphasis would again have to be on the opposition of spirit and body, not on the temporal opposition, for Raphael makes it clear that he will liken "spiritual to corporal forms" (V.s73). In much of the current concern with typological symbolism insufficient attention is given to the fact that the difference between a type and antitype is not a matter of time only but can also be a difference between the physical and the spiritual, between the external medium and the inner meaning. Like the theory of accommodation, typology is capable of different emphases by different writers. Since in Paradise Lost the theory of typology is said to concern the distinction between "Flesh" and "Spirit," we should per- haps question whether in every situation a type necessarily "looks forward in time, not upward through the scale of being. "24 There seems to be good evidence, then, that Raphael's statement that Earth may be "but the shaddow of Heav'n" is an allusion to the Platonic theory of Ideas, with its view of Earth as an analogue of the transcendental realm. Since the theory is voiced as part of the answer to the specific prob- lem of how to express the transcendental in humanly understandable language, it constitutes a part of the poetic theory of symbolism which Milton brought to the apocalyptic portions of his narrative. If Earth is really like Heaven, the latter can accurately be portrayed by using the images of the former. But if the doctrine of Ideas is part of Milton's poetic theory, it is also true that there is not much insistence on this fact in the poem. Unlike the concept of accommodation, the idea that Earth is a copy of the transcendental realm is not pervasive in the epic. The description in Book III of the "Kingly Palace Gate," along with the corresponding assertion by the narrator that the scene cannot be adequately limned in earthly images, is perhaps a reference to the imper- fect analogy between the archetype and its earthly copy: 24 Madsen lists this as one of the defining characteristics of the type in his essay "From Shadowy Types to Truth," in The Lyric and Dramatic Milton, ed. Joseph H. Summers (New York, 1965), p. 99. 236</page><page sequence="15">MILTON AND THE APOCALYPTIC thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. (111.507-509) In the account of Creation there are also passages which are consonant with the Platonic theory of the relationship between Earth and Heaven, as when the Creator looks upon his work and finds it good, "Answering his great Idea" (VII.557), and the Creation is said to be so perfect "That Earth now/Seemd like to Heav'n" (VII.328-329). Similarly, the epic nar- rator describes Paradise as "A Heav'n on Earth" (IV.2o8), and Satan, find- ing Earth to be a "Terrestrial Heav'n" (IX.io3), is led to exclaim, "O Earth, how like to Heav'n.. ." (IX.99). Elsewhere God states, "Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n" (VII.617), and in recounting the war in Heaven Raphael assures Adam that Heaven possesses hills, "For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n / Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale" (VI.64o-64 1). Passages such as these, suggesting an actual correspondence between Heaven and Earth, imply an underlying principle which is at least in accordance with the Platonic theory of Ideas. In most instances, however, there is no direct reference to the Platonic doctrine. It is perhaps well to note that Raphael's allusion in V.574-576 appears in a subordinate clause and is phrased as a question rather than a declaration, thereby weakening the force of the statement. Raphael's formulation of the theory is designed to act as a buttress to the doctrine of accommodation. As we have seen, Milton in the De Doctrina Christiana could not make up his mind on the question of whether the accommodated representation was literal or figu- rative. Raphael here uses the theory of Ideas to express the tentative con- clusion that the images are a literal picture of spiritual reality. The most accurate conclusion would seem to be that the Platonic theory of Ideas fitted well with Milton's doctrine of accommodation, and that he used it to supplement that doctrine rather than insisting on it as the basic princi- ple of his apocalyptic poetics. In actual poetic technique the theory that earthly objects are the imper- fect replicas of a transcendental realm would lead to much the same results as the doctrine of accommodation. On the one hand, the theory would form a philosophic justification for portraying ultimate reality by means of the tangible objects of earthly experience. But the earthly object is an imperfect copy, and a fundamental cleavage between the two worlds will always exist. The poetic narrative, while using physical objects and asser- ting the validity of the earthly analogue, might still claim that the action is "spiritual" and different from the "corporal" vehicle. The complex nature of the theory of Ideas would thus allow for a heavenly terrain filled with such earthly objects as "Hills. . . , Rocks, Waters, Woods" (VI.644- 645) without nullifying Adam's feeling that Raphael's account has, in 237</page><page sequence="16">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY some sense, presented "Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,/ Farr differing from this World" (VI I.70-7 1 ). Like the doctrine of accommoda- tion, the theory of Ideas does not lead to simple conclusions, but it does help to explain the rich diversities and paradoxes which we find in Mil- ton's epic. IV If, in conclusion, we integrate the various strands of philosophy and literary theory with which Milton approached the writing of his poem, we find that they correspond and reinforce each other to a remarkable extent. The doctrine of accommodation and the Platonic theory of Ideas both provide a foundation for a portrayal of apocalyptic reality in physi- cal, human terms. At the same time, these philosophic assumptions do not minimize a very real difference between the visible and invisible worlds, and in their various ways they maintain an insistence that the apocalyptic vision is, in important ways, inaccessible to human experience in a direct way. An awareness of the theoretic considerations underlying Milton's solution of the problems which his subject matter presented is helpful not only in establishing the assumptions with which Milton com- posed his epic and with which the reader of his generation interpreted the poem, but also in suggesting profitable critical approaches to Paradise Lost. The theoretic background establishes expectations which a study of the poem will show in their fulfillment. 238</page></plain_text>
