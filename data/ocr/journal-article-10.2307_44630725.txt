<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEXUALITY, SEMIOSIS AND BINARISM: A NARRATOLOGICAL COMMENT ON BERGREN AND ARTHUR MIEKE BAL The papers by both Arthur and Bergren, the one more explicitly than the other, deal with the (hu)man fantasy, apparently vivid in male-dominated cultures, that linguistic and semiotic competence has something to do with the sexes. This fantasy seems based on the analogy between semiosis and the reproduction of life, both seen as creations. The fantasy cannot but be rooted in a sense of the ultimate importance of semiosis in cultural life, since it makes semiosis a synonym for birthgiving, and culture for life. As such, it is also the expression of culture's own self-esteem. Focus on the differences between the sexes introduces the notion of conflict or tension. And once this notion is overvalued, we anticipate, by the psychological law that anything overrated will inevitably generate its op- posite, an overvaluation of harmony as well. Accordingly, the development of a fabula for this male fantasy invites a wish for the fantasy to be ended, and for language to lose its gender. If, indeed, language has to do with sex, because it structures a world in which sexes struggle, then it is only normal that myths are invented in order to provide that state of affairs with a beginning that is intended to authenticate and thus to justify it. The importance of both papers under dis- cussion is that they analyze in detail ancient Greek versions of such a myth, so that it becomes, once understood, understandable, hence, changeable. This is how these papers are, or can be made, critical in the sense of critical theory (Habermas 1972). In my comments, I will stress the critical import of the papers, leaving aside many other aspects. Why must myth and language have to do with sex? It is, of course, impossible to answer that fundamental question on the basis of evidence from one cultural community. It is, on the other hand, useless to speculate on generalities without studying specific utterances of the fantasy. Both papers represent an important step toward a fuller understanding of the whole problem, by presenting a thorough analysis of one, or a few related, cases. They complement each other usefully, in that Arthur's paper in- tegrates the problems within the overall structure of one small fragment which is, in its turn, the basis of Hesiod's mythology, while Bergren's, starting 117 ARETHUSA VOL. 16 (1983) 1, 2</page><page sequence="2">118 Mie ke Bal from the same instance, broadens the field of application of their findings in the study of several utterances, from several authors and genres.1 Thus, the detailed in combination with the more global account displays exactly that dialectical procedure which is the only possible way toward an under- standing of general human issues. The question howl , applied to this par- ticular fantasy, can thus be integrated into the question why ? which, as an opening toward change, is the basis of its study's relevance for modern society. The dialectical principle applies to yet another aspect of these two studies. Approaching them from the point of view of semiotic, e.g., narrato- logical theory, which is my field of study, I perceive a relation between the issues they raise and the structure of narratology itself. That revelation allows me to stress, in my comment, the fruitfulness of a dialogue between the study of specific literatures and theory - which is not, as some people fear, a unilateral "commercial" relation in which hermeneuticists or prac- tical critics borrow tools from theory, but at least as much the opposite. Therefore, I will first concentrate upon two aspects of these studies which have their correlate in narratology: time and the subject. These aspects are related to one other by the problematic position of the latter, the subject, which undermines the apparent certainty of the former, time. And this undermining is essential. For, as Arthur stresses in her analysis of gastēr , ambiguity and uncertainty are the real creative forces as well as the basic principles of semiosis. I. Time The competence men cannot appropriate is giving birth. The repro- ductive function of the female being more obvious, more spectacular than the male's, myths about a male creator are abundant. Uterus-envy, of which the concept of penis-envy is to a large extent a projection in the psycho- analytical sense, has been successfully repressed with the help of myths according to which the beginning of human life is the work of a male god. Those myths share one interesting feature: they present the appropriated power as something the male always and/or exclusively had. Bergren, in note 28, gives the example of Zeus. God the Father of Christianity, bor- rowed from the Tenakh, Gen . 2, is another clear instance. One may speculate about the reasons why this appropriation was so valued an achievement. According to most of those myths, it is the control of time, directly related to reproduction, that is so desirable. The sense of time is itself a sense of the</page><page sequence="3">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 1 19 end. Reproduction is a way to overcome the tragic feeling of contingency which is the result of mortality. It makes history, that is, continuity. The fear of the end is compensated by the obsession with beginnings. Myth is in itself an utterance of that obsession. So is historiography. There- in lies the interest of Bergren's extension of the question of origins to Herodotus' Histories . Myth and history are, there, integrated, in that, as she says, the particular illustrates the general system, and, thus, explains it. In a sense, historiography always comes close to mythology. This is not only so because, as Godley already stated in his introduction to the Loeb edition of Herodotus, "Obviously, the condition of human beliefs and opinions falls within the field of history." The relation is more congenial: both are rooted in a desire to know our origin, to describe it the way we wish to understand it. The very fact that Herodotus asserts himself as a historian by giving two competing accounts of the beginning thematizes the obsession with beginnings in general. Apropos of our present discussion, it thematizes as well the obsession with the possibility of discovering the truth of the origin in terms of subjects, that is, with the question: who began? If Herodotus starts his Histories with the question of the beginning of the opposition between east and west, problematic in terms of subject- positions, Hesiod starts his Theogony with the query into the origin of his own poetic competence. From a narratological point of view, both authors commit anachronies.2 Herodotus discusses the beginnings of the hostilities after first telling that there were wars: analepsis? Hesiod's case is carefully analyzed by Arthur: the beginning of the text represents the end. of the fabula, since the Muses are born after the establishment of Zeus' reign, the object of the fabula. The poet needs to begin with the offspring of his object, as if he were to show the confusion of his sense of time and its relation to reproduction. These anachronies, at the beginning of both texts, display the basic arbitrariness involved in this search for beginnings. Origins are called into being, they are posited, and it is exactly the narration of myth and history that constitutes the act of positing the beginning. The Muses, descending, as Arthur says, from a timeless world to the time-bound order, bring as their gift the activity which allows man to make the time-bound timeless: poetry. This paradoxical solution to the problem of beginnings thematizes a characteristic of narrative: unlike lyrical poetry and drama, narrative has to posit its beginning: 'one day,' 'once upon a time,' in order to detach the time of the fabula from the time of narration, thus starting the manipu- lation of its double time-structure which is acknowledged as the characteristic feature of the genre.</page><page sequence="4">120 Mieke Bal It is here that Arthur, quoting Pucci, invokes Derrida, and rightly so, in order to stress the general import of this paradox. Representation, which aims at the withdrawal from time, implies a "temporalizing detour of de- ferring." Thus, all semiosis, in its very intention to transcend it, is subjected to time. If men want to appropriate women's linguistic competence, it is precisely because of this paradox. It is not so much eternal life, but a har- monious solution to the conflict, that they covet. They would not give up the gastēr which symbolizes mortality, hence the insertion into history, but they would endow it with reproductive power, combine truth with fiction, history with myth. Menelaus, retroactively constructing a fiction out of Helen's allegedly true words, as both authors state, appropriates the mimetic power, but both Helen and the Muses had themselves, first, determined that possibility. He only accepts a gift offered to him by the female. In the perspective of this attitude of narrative toward time and the problem of historicity, a feature of the structure of narratology itself acquires special significance. It is perhaps not a coincidence that time is the most elaborated category of narratology. Not only has it traditionally been a favorite topic in the German Romantheorie ,4 but it is still the category to which extensive sections of books on narratology are devoted. Character- istically, Genette 's Narrative Discourse 5 largely consists of a refined analysis of time aspects: this topic takes up three out of the five chapters and those chapters are the first ones of the book. Among them, the chapter devoted to "Order" comes first, then "Duration," and finally "Frequency." And Order is the category which is thematized in the ancient texts under dis- cussion: the question of beginnings, of what came first, of narrative's un- canny split nature consisting of two time orders. But it also thematizes the reassuring ability of narrative to invert order and to start at the end to make beginnings which subsequently allow us to repress the sense of the end. That is the basic function of the anachronies at the beginning/end of Hesiod's and Herodotus' texts. And those chapters of Genette's book which deal with time problems are doubtless the most successful ones and the least con- troversial. In so far as they provoked debate, the disputants claimed that Genette's method was not scientific enough, that the results were not defini- tive. Their relevance itself, though perhaps questionable, was not doubted. Thus, those participating in the discussion displayed a thorough concern for the same preoccupations: to fix, to control time. More than in the curious phenomenon of the time-control of nar- rative itself, critics seemed interested in the possibility of controlling that control. This staggering obsession with time betrays a formalistic attitude that can only be rooted in a psychological need connected with the desire</page><page sequence="5">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 121 for semiotic power which Bergren in particular analyzes in her paper. Had both authors specifically analyzed the formal time-structure of their object- texts, using the three categories of order, duration and frequency,6 their points would have been even more convincing. The relation between the obsessions with the control of time and with the possession of semiotic power would, then, have formed a complex knot for which psychoanalytical theory alone offers an explanation. As it stands, the 'circles of order' of which Arthur, in her title, promises to analyze the poetics, remain rather unspeci- fied, since both their delimitation and their interrelations are not explicitly discussed. The scope of her paper is nevertheless wider than its title indi- cates, a difference which may be due to an (unconscious?) understating of its feminist impact. Bergren's paper, on the other hand, covers so much material that she could by no means detail the temporal analysis any further. The three categories of time cover the possible manipulations of the double temporal structure of narrative, termed differently by various scholars (e.g., récit-histoire; discours-histoire; sujet-f abula). The relation between the time sequence in the narrative and the time sequence in the fabula can display distortions in order , when one event which in the repre- sented fabula comes after the previous one, is narrated first in the text, or vice versa. Figures of order, globally divided, according to the direction of the anachrony, into analepsis and prolepsis , can be further analyzed and compared according to the temporal distance between the represented event and the moment in the chain of events interrupted by the anachrony. This distance can lead to an extension of the fabula beyond the limits of its primary line. The figures of order also cover a certain span of time, equally analyzable. The relation can be of duration - a more problematic category since one of the two reference-points, the 'time' of the narrative, is undefin- able causing the relation to depend on an approximation and not an ab- solute.7 Frequency is the category of the variations from the standard which assumes as its degree zero the singular representation, that is, numerical equivalence of events and their representation: IN/IF (one mention in the narrative of one event in the fabula).8 These three categories do, of course, overlap, but Genette's analyses of various texts, from Homer to Robbe-Grillet, give more than enough evidence of their relevance for the diachronic study of narrative styles. In my view, however, the very interest authors and scholars take in this issue is also relevant in a more critical sense. The use of formally adequate and per- cise tools is not interesting in itself, but it can clarify other, very relevant issues and provide insights which otherwise remain vague. For narratology,</page><page sequence="6">122 Mieke Bal as it stands, has a problem. That problem is behind the alleged failures in Genette's time-system, which cannot be blamed for it. It is the problem that any manipulation of time is subject-bound . If Hesiod appeals to the Muses to authenticate9 the poet's power, and to Zeus to authenticate the Muses', if Herodotus appeals to a double, contradictory subject to prove the relevance, by its very problematic character, of the authentication of the beginning, they are like fathers who are always unsure of their paternity. Which brings us back to the beginning of the present discussion. The slight flaws of the narratological theory of time are due to the basic subjectivity of both time itself and of narrative. It is, therefore, the category of the subject, signifi- cantly the least elaborated as well as the most problematic category of nar- ratology, which ultimately founds all the others. That uncanny state of affairs is repressed by those who try to separate time from the subject, be they modern critics or ancient historians and poets. IL The Subject In Bergren's paper, the uncertainty of fatherhood is suggested as the reason for the male desire exclusively to possess semiotic power. Arthur, without explicitly giving the same explanation, convincingly demonstrates at the end of her paper the exclusion of women and of the body from the agora , the realm of pure logos . This apparently successful exclusion is undermined, however, by a return of the repressed in the form of a metaphor quoted by Arthur ( Theog . 83-84) for linguistic competence - a metaphor entirely situated in the isotopy10 of corporeality. The uncertainty of father- hood is connected to the representational monopoly of the female, who can speak true or imitate the truth at will, as she can, by her use of language, make true and false fathers. In spite of the fact that the said uncertainty is beyond question, it is, however, also relative. As everybody knows, it depends on the meaning of the concept of fatherhood and on the relation between male and female. Making it absolute, hence something worth struggling against, is over- rating the position of the subject, both in language and in human interaction. Therefore, the attempt to outdo woman is both unnecessary, since hers is not so absolute a position, and doomed to failure, since, as we know from Kristeva, Derrida, and Lacan, binary thinking always leaves a residue, thus instating ambiguity. In fact, the very attempt at binary thinking dis- plays a lack of semiotic understanding. In narratology as in other theories, the position of the subject is problematic. In spite of insistence on the splitting of the subject (for an ac-</page><page sequence="7">A Narraîological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 123 count, see Culler 1981), in spite of the subject's instability and lack of con- sistency, most theories (e.g., Coward and Ellis 1977) still tend to represent it as somehow fixed, that is, identified with the human individual. The limits of its questioning are thus identical with those of the questioning of the human. This is not surprising, since the feeling of the human of his or her own unity constitutes that very unity, by the fact that it is a subjective feeling. We can not, like the Baron von Miinchausen, raise oursdves by our own hair. In my opinion, however, the notion of subject and its correlate. subjectivity , should be considered as a semiotic notion in the first place. Semiosis as a practice requires, as I will argue, subjects to support it. Hence, the human individual in his or her subjectivity is a result, more than a source, of the semiotic practice. I would therefore suggest examining the relation between language, hence narrative, and the concept of the subject, in the context in which this relation belongs: the every day use of language.11 We are used to considering language as an instrument, a tool which is supposed to allow us to grasp pre-existing essences. Discourse, then, is not consciously felt as a signifying practice. We are aware of the ideas we want to express, and we look for the appropriate signifiers to label them, without being aware of the linguistic nature of the ideas themselves. But "thought is nothing other than the power to construct representations of things and to operate on these representations. It is in essence symbolic" (Benveniste 1971:25) In other words, thought is already a combination of signifiers. Signifiers are used to mark off areas in the experiential continuum of the world. Once language (among other signifying systems) has divided up this continuum, we are inclined to consider the distinctions which thus construct entities as essential. The process is a social one. Only a group can establish ideas about how the world is supposed to be divided into entities - about "how things are." The conventions at stake help ideology into exis- tence by endowing distinctions with self-evidence. As Belsey put it: Because it is characteristic of language to be overlooked, the differences it constructs may seem to be natural, uni- versal and unalterable when in reality they may be pro- duced by a specific form of social organization. (1980:42). Thus the seeming transparency of language is the very seat of ideology. One of the most powerful instruments of ideology inherent in the supplanted view is the underlying idea that the subject is whole, autonomous and active. This idea also underlies the myth under discussion. The im- plications of the new view are therefore enormous. It not only overthrows</page><page sequence="8">124 Mieke Bal the position of the subject, but also, in doing this, it allows us to break into the system itself, to criticize it from within, and thus to assume responsi- bility for our own subjection. Paradoxically, the so-called free subject, unaware of its position, is in fact subjected, while the awareness of that subjection allows insight and active participation in the criticism of the structure of the subjectivity of our signifying practices: subject-{act)ivity. The inconsistency in the notion of subject, obvious as it is in the definitions given in dictionaries like the Petit Robert , is smoothed over by the use of a single word to "cover" hilariously diverging ideas. The Kantian definition, overtly idealistic, "être pensant, considéré comme le siège de la connaissance," is significantly situated at the end of the entire lemma which occupies half a page (a whole column) in the dictionary. The first definition is the one that insists on the subjection of the subject: "qui est dans la dé- pendance d'une autorité supérieure." Of course, such a concept will be filled in according to one's system of thought, by different sorts of sub- jection: the authority may be God, Zeus, the Father (Lacan), the State or whatever, but still the users of the notion have subjection in common. The second cluster of definitions seems less important here since its denotatum is not anthropomorphic, but should not be left out: "matière, point, question, thème" and other synonyms of "topic." Its interest lies in its semantic nature. Third comes the logical or syntactical definition: "Terme con- sidéré comme le point de départ de l'énoncé" [. . .]." Only the fourth group of definitions concerns humans. It starts with "Etre individuel, personne considérée comme le support d'une action, d'une influence" a defini- tion consonant with the opinion above, in which the subject is a position in the signifying practice of society. This last cluster, like the first, includes passive and dependent subjects such as persons subjected to an examination, or, worse, patients in the medical sense, guinea pigs and test objects. The already quoted Kantian definition closes the list. The incoherence of such a concept covers a deep and hidden co- herence, which comes to light when we juxtapose the first and the last definition. If the human subject is no more than a "siège," the Kantian Robert seems to agree with Lacan and the Post-Saussurians, for, despite its royal name, a "siège" is nothing more than a place, a locus where things happen. Subject in the sense of topic carries the idea that the briefest sum- mary of the meanings that will be retained after the actions of all the sub- jects involved have come to a stop, is the subject of a text, ready to become myth. The subject in this sense is a product of the narrative subjects as they will be defined below. The collocation of both meanings betrays the close connection between myth and narrative. This subject, the meaning of a</page><page sequence="9">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 125 text, (de)forms the subject in the human sense. The subject in the syntactical- logical sense is the starting-point of an utterance. If it is at the same time the center of the proposition - and it often is - it easily contributes to the formation of the center of the whole statement, thus leading to the determi- nation of the topic. The last cluster of definitions is interesting because of the idea that the subject is "considéré comme le support de Taction, d'une influence." This function of the subject as a position, a "support" on both sides of the semiotic process, connects the action of the literary sender to the influence on the receiver. Considering these definitions, we cannot but conclude that the very notion of subject as it functions in our society gives evidence in favor of the generalized though perhaps unconscious acceptance of the above-mentioned new view of our subjectivity as dissolved. This complexity of the concept of subject cannot be ignored or "defined-away." As J. A. Miller put it, in the specific context of linguistically oriented psychoanalysis: "Il faut garder ensemble les définitions qui font du sujet l'effet du signifiant , et du signifiant le représentant du sujet " (1966:51). Transfer of this complex notion of the subject to the study of literary objects requires a reconsideration of the semiotic, e.g., textual subject. There is a continuous line in this respect from structuralism to post-struc- turalism. For a reconsideration of this kind is possible within the narrato- logical theories as they have been elaborated in the structuralist period and as they are still being developed (see Genette 1979, Rimmon 1977, Bal 1977). On the basis of the definition of the Robert , considered as a document of the linguistic behavior of the French, the following working definition can be formulated (for an extensive argumentation, see Bal, 1983): The semiotic subject is the support of semiotic action, the starting point of its syntactic and pragmatic dimensions and the centre of its semantic dimension, which combines, produces, conveys and retains meanings according to the rules of the system in which it functions. The subject thus conceived is an agent in the first place, a role rather than an individual. Action can be executed on many different levels of semiosis. As soon as a verb can be used to describe what happens in semiosis, that verb can be attributed to a subject. For example, the action of narrating implies a narrator. If the analysis of a text aims at an account of the semiotic process, its first steps will logically be the splitting of the different subjects that act</page><page sequence="10">126 Mie ke Bal under the general heading of [author]. The basic distinction between nar- rator or voice, focalisor or subject of vision, and actor or subject of diegetic action, is such a first step. A very simple and well-known example may illustrate the relevance of this distinction. In Iliad 22.475-515, esp. 499, the distribution of subject-positions contributes to displaying the most im- portant aspect of Astyanax' misery, the description of which, already here, is exposed as still too optimistic. The narrator-position is distributed ac- cording to the principle of embedding (see Bal 1981). The overall external narrator (EN) tells that personal narrator Andromache (PN) tells that the anonymous, imaginary child (PN) tells: line 499. This structure can be formulated as: EN[PN And. [PN child]]. As for focalisation, the next line implies that Astyanax, though denied narrative power, is the focalisor of the narrated content of line 499: ENF[PNF Andr. [PF Ast. [PNF child]]]. The relevance of 499 lies, for Andromache, in this focalising position of her son. But the most meaningful feature of this passage is not so much his focalising activity as his narrative powerlessness. The asymmetry between narration and focalisation shows that one agent is not strong enough to participate fully, within this later partially falsified prolepsis, in the nar- rative semiosis. Thus Andromache, unaware of what is really about to happen, is made to betray narratively to what extent the father's death renders their son powerless. The mourning discourse indicates with pre- cision the locus of the lack which death produces - in Astyanax* narrative powerlessness. The distinguishing of these narrative positions can be used as a tool for the analysis of ideology in the text. The heuristic questions - who speaks? who focalises? who acts - bring into focus incoherences, splits, gaps in the semiotic process, that is, in the transfer of the message from source to destination, from action to influence. Such incoherences are easily naturalized, unconsciously smoothed over when we attribute an unproblematic subjectivity to a named author. There exist two narrative practices in which the instability of the semiotic subject is deeply implicated: myth and psychoanalysis. As Bergren extensively demonstrates, the source of the fascination with women is the uncanny instability of her subjectivity. Secondary and original, passive and active, she is both subject and object. The resulting desire is paradoxi- cal. Her subjection is in fact required only when men believe in the pos- sibility of her subjectivity being whole. This illusion, which reflects the male subject's sense of his own instability, can only be projected on the female as other. The myths of woman's possession of semiotic power and, hence, of the male need to steal it, the myth of the Muses and that of Helen,</page><page sequence="11">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 127 are based on the illusion of possible wholeness, of which woman, perceived in her otherness, is the incarnation. Hesiod's line in which he quotes/invents the words of the Muses, who state/are invented to state that they are the exclusive subjects of truth and fiction, that is, of all semiosis, is in itself the expression of its own quoted/invented content. If, as Arthur says following Pucci, homoion means similar (fiction) and identical (truth), the sentence itself, in its turn, stands in an iconic relation to the topic. As all iconism, it threatens the whole poetic enterprise with circularity. More than a mere icon, that is, a sign which is in its own structure partially analoguous to the structure of its content, we may consider this phrase as a mise en abîme. Mise en abîme , a term of French narratology and a device frequently used in the French modernist and post-modernist novel,12 is a specific sub-class of icons. The term in- dicates those icons which, being themselves a small, distinct unit of the text, as in the present case, an embedded discourse, have as their content some relevant and continuous aspect of the text as a whole. In this case, the ambiguous factual status of epic in general and of Hesiod's Theogony in particular, is illuminated by the sentence attributed, but by a creative poet, to the Muses. This staggering circularity of the poet's attempt to ap- propriate semiotic competence is caused by what is behind its own theme: the possession cannot be whole, since the other is needed in order for the semiotic practice to work. And consequently, the other is not whole either, nor is she "threatening." The subjectivity to be appropriated is not a stable possession. It is a floating, circulating position. The first person position is, as Benveniste stressed, defined by the second person, while the second person position only exists momentarily in the process of exchange of the two positions. This implication of the myth of the Muses and of Hesiod's particular view of it, finds its application in psychoanalytical practice. What dis- tinguishes that practice from its impossible but often dreamt of counter- part, self-analysis, is exactly the floating subjectivity. The important process of transference and countertransference, which would be impossible without the semiotic (truth and fiction) basis, are so indispensable for this very reason. In addition, psychoanalytical theory contributed to these in- sights by its stress on that other floating position, the sexual position itself, by its stress, that is, on bisexuality. Obviously, the myth of the female semiotic monopoly is also based on a related, illusory rigid division of the sexes. The undermining effect of psychoanalysis in this domain can be very fruitful. But as such it only exemplifies the impossibility of binarism in general, which is a semiotic issue.</page><page sequence="12">128 Mieke Bal III. The Semiotics of Uncertainty What the Muses teach Hesiod - or is Hesiod the teacher? - is the principle of semiosis which constitutes the difference between animal and human life, including that part of semiosis that is never completely absent but variedly distributed: poesis. The truth and pseudo-truth are undif- ferentiated in what Arthur, following Lewis, calls "representational im- purity." The term in itself expresses that nostalgic concern for purity in semiotic matters that so treacherously preoccupies scientists. It must be stressed, however, that the said "impurity" is not the opposite of purity, nor of truth, completeness, certainty or reality. It is the basic characteristic of semiosis that it makes all these irrelevant . And it may be in that irrelevance that the deepest cause of the fantasy under analysis is situated. Helen's good drug thematizes the case, while Arthur's analysis of the word gastēr exemplifies it. The ambiguity of gastēr is not explained away but, felicitously, retained and fully exploited in Arthur's paper. Thus, Arthur is able to demonstrate that its ambiguity is double-sided: the word has many meanings, and the cluster of meanings retained contains the seme/ ambiguity / itself. The relation between the two sides needs further exami- nation. This double register associates gastēr with the other ambiguous words, which provide this text with its uncanny circularity. They all have in common that their referent is incomplete without its complement: in this case the divine spirit, which allows the gastēr to fulfill its function of inserting man into history, into time, for that insertion requires a con- sciousness, which requires divine inspiration. I would like to insist, however, on a few conceptual points related to this issue: the concepts of code , " absence " and the resulting vagueness of the concept of ambiguity itself. In her discussion of the ambiguity of the Muses' reproach to the shepherd/poet, Arthur distinguishes between the geographical, the ethical and the alimentary "codes." This use of this term produces ambiguity in the critical discourse, threatening it, therefore, with circularity. For if, as might seem to be the case here, the term in use is arbitrary, the distinctions it helps to establish are not otherwise justified and hence, the stated trans- gressions of the arbitrarily designed boundaries are called into being by the same move - a procedure which we must try to avoid. Contrary to the definition of code implicit in Arthur's discussion, a code is not a semantic field (which I would rather term isotopy), but a rule which couples items from systems of expression with items from semantic systems (Eco 1976:37; 48-150). A code has no content in itself. In a looser</page><page sequence="13">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 129 use of the term, we speak of a social, ethical, alimentary, etc. code to refer to the socially acknowledged rules of behavior in those domains. This use is perhaps implied, but not systematically, in Arthur's analysis. The division of the Muses' speech into three social domains may be legitimate in itself. It needs, however, further, extra-textual evidence, in order to avoid the said circularity. Such evidence is indeed given, for example, when she mentions a transitional position conventionally attributed to shepherds. This position is semantic, and does not enhance any specific code. It is the general semiotic code as it is at work in connotation, for example, which allows the analysis of the three domains as mutually complementary. A more precise use of semiotic concepts can better illuminate Arthur's in- sights. According to Eco and to most semioticians (e.g., Barthes 1966), there is connotation when the content of an expression becomes the expression of a further content. As Eco (1976:55) expressly states, the difference be- tween denotation and connotation is not the difference between 'univocal' and 'vague' signification. The connotative principle is the possibility, based on convention, of further signification which relies on a primary one. Gastēr can only function as it does because it means belly. It is the concept of belly, as the primary content of the expression gastēr , which is in its turn the expression of the concept of physical need, a content which is in its turn the expression of the concept of mortality, and so forth. In this view, gastēr is by no means a 'floating signifier' of ambiguity. 'Ambiguity' is one of the connotative contents of the word, which is, as a signifier, not so much floating as, on the contrary, a fairly stable anchorage of a complex network of connotative meanings. That complexity is better defined as a surplus of meanings than as a lack of precision, for it is the plurality of hierarchically ordered meanings that makes the expression so powerful. Nor, in my view, is Arthur's use of the idea of "absence" or "silence" very felicitous, since it obliterates two aspects of the "representational im- purity": its unavoidability, and the resultant surplus of meaning. The idea is frequently used in the German school of Rezeptionsästhetik (Iser 1972) but there it poses the same problems. Hamon (1982) gives an interesting survey of its problematic aspects, without, of course, denying its importance for a critique of ideology. The most frequently used term for this idea is gap. Gaps are cor- related to the concept of frame. This is a concept in cognitive theory, best known in Minski's version (1975), which is more or less fashionable in literary studies. One of the more precise definitions in use can be found in Van Dijk (1977) where the term indicates a "set of propositions character- izing our conventional knowledge of some more or less autonomous</page><page sequence="14">130 Mieke Bal situation (activity, course of events, state)." In his elaboration of the con- cept for discourse analysis, Van Dijk specifies (1977:99) that "such frames include propositions determining the possible ordering of facts." Thus, the concept of frame indicates the conventional knowledge that pushes readers to ask questions about unspecified circumstances in the text, and to fill in the answers to those questions. Frames are conventional, implicit, fit to be partially actualized and they help to construct normality. They are an organizing principle. They organize our perception of fictional worlds into typical sets of properties that make us capable of naturalizing "unnatural" worlds, e.g., of reading fiction and accepting it. The concept of frame is already somewhat vague, but its counterpart, be it called gap, absence or silence (German: Lehrstelle ), is much more so. Iser (1972) uses the concept in practice mainly to indicate formal shifts, like changes in focalization, shifts between "telling" and "showing" and the like. Others describe gaps as the spots in the text in which the infor- mation is insufficient, so that the reader cannot but ask questions. In most cases, questions will later be answered. Arthur's first case, the situation in Zeus' reign and its causes, omitted in the prooemium, belongs to this cate- gory. The problem, here, is the standard of sufficiency. It is perfectly pos- sible that nobody will ásk him- or herself where the Muses come from, who their father is and how he came into power, and the like, wh^e later the in- formation, when given, will still be retroactively related to the Muses of the beginning/end - see section 2. The first use of gaps, in the Iserian way, is less problematic than the second but also inadequate. Shifts of the aforementioned kind can indeed be indicated, but why should shifts be termed gaps! The manipulation of time and the narrative subjectivity on which it depends is so congenial to narrative discourse, that any suggestion of a particular lack in the case of shifts or transitions is as useless as it is awkward. 'Shifts' is a more positive, more specific and hence more properly descriptive term, which allows further specification. 'Indeterminacy' is a third concept Arthur uses it in her discussion of gastēr. In her discussion, it is a synonym for ambiguity. It is the case to which I most strongly object. For ambiguity, as she herself shows, is a sur- plus, an openness of meaning, which allows a textual unity to fulfill its function of transition or crossroad between different isotopies. Gastēr is not an instance of ambiguity but of multiple connotation. The word has one primary meaning, and not a set of equally primary meanings, like properly ambiguous words, for example, 'bank.' It func- tions according to the connotative code, in different successive phases, in</page><page sequence="15">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 131 order to assume, as its deepest meaning, the "fragility and the ineluct- ability of all boundaries": another connotative content, that is, ambiguity. To put it strongly: gastēr unambiguously signifies ambiguity. Terming this a gap, silence or absence is obliterating how much such a word posi- tively structures the meaning of the whole text, in all its subtleties. It is, in fact, repeating, on the hermeneutic level, the tension between the poles of all binary oppositions, and its resolution in an exclusive, negative direc- tion. While 'absence,' 'silence' or 'gap' imply a lack, ambiguity and con- notation imply a surplus, a generating and structuring capacity. And where semiosis is in itself defined by the inadequacy of the sign-referent relation and the irrelevance of such requirements as completeness, reality and truth, the generating and structuring capacity of ambiguous and connotative signs is not only the more interesting, but also the only typically semiotic feature. Why not, then, stress that aspect in the concept used to describe it, and term those cases, according to their specificity, shifters, or con- notations, or ambiguous signs, or some other word which would indicate the creative power and the subject position involved? Helen's drug in Odyssey IV, as analyzed by Bergren, thematizes this aspect of semiosis. The function of the drug is to separate discourse from its referent - in other words, to make the referent irrelevant. But this referent is not just any referent: it concerns the family relations and their emotive impact. The fact that the drug is offered on the wedding/mourning evening, that is, at the moment of the consecration of the separation parents/ children, at a moment both celebrated and deplored, is not a coincidence. Taking from Helen's drug is, then, fully entering into the symbolic order, the order of separation. The analogy between Helen and the Muses lies also here: both possess and offer the other the capacity for separation: of language and referent, of mother and child, of discourse and emotion. Bergren demonstrated extensively, in the present and in an earlier paper, how Helen's drug fails in its effect because of the very ambiguity of the semiosis given by the Muses. If Menelaus manages retroactively to belie her, and hence to undo the effect of her drug, he does so in the first place because, as Bergren says, both the drug and poetry (fiction) defeat the power to control them, by undermining neat oppositions. There is yet another reason for Menelaus' success: his discourse as well as Helen's is narrative, and hence capable of inverting time structure, capable of retroaction. Narrative is capable of manipulating and controlling time. But it can do so by the force of its subjectivity. The neat category of time in nar- ratology is ultimately powerless since it is meaningful only when the temporal unities are attached to a subject: Helen starts and can be temporarily be-</page><page sequence="16">132 Mieke Bal lieved; Menelaus wins because he is last in time and his analepsis covers two moments: the event at Troy and Helen's true/false story. When Helen, as Bergren points out, is both the subject and a figure of her song, that means that she is twice subject: singing and acting, but also subject and object of focalization, subject and subjected. She resembles in her double role the poet, the male bard. Confusion, mutual reversal of the roles of male and female, bard and Muses, secondary and original, man and god, it all points to a representation of ambiguity, more than of the clear-cut appropriation by the male of a female power.13 It is in this respect perhaps interesting to reverse also Freud's ques- tion, suggestively quoted by Bergren, about the scarcity of female inven- tions. His explanation of woman's interest in weaving is so obviously a projection, since for the woman herself there is nothing to hide, that we may legitimately ask not why women invented so little, a question easy to answer, since she had no access to the world in which inventions were required, but why men were so eager to invent. The answer may be worded in Homer's and Hesiod's account of the appropriation of semiotic competence: out of a jealousy caused by the misunderstanding of a neat sex-opposition: be- cause the basic invention, reproduction, is female. One final remark on the multiple relations between theory and hermeneutics. In order to remain consistent with its own principles, modern semiotic theory cannot, and in fact, does not, claim a rigid, scientific, superior position. It is not a master, a guard and a limit to hermeneutics. Nor is it just a tool, to be used or thrown away according to the hermeneuticists' will. Hermeneutics, on the other hand, is not just evidence or illustration of theory. Nor is it the last word, falsifying any theoretical attempt at will. The relations are multiple in both directions. If, in the present comment, I argued for a hidden connection between the complex displayed in an ancient myth and the problems of today's narratology, it was on the one hand on the basis of the two discussed interpretations that the connection could be argued for at all. On the other hand, it is indeed narratology that allowed such an extension of the import of the interpretations. One of the relations between theory and hermeneutics deserves special attention. I am referring to those cases where a text under exami- nation seems to thematize an issue of modern theory. The device of self- reflexivity is an example, also called immanent poetics: the structure, goal or procedure of the poetic text itself is said to be the content of certain text- fragments. The address of the Muses is such a case. When, in her earlier,</page><page sequence="17">A Narratological Comment on Bergren and Arthur 133 quoted paper, "Helen's 'Good Drug,"' Bergren suggests that "the text changed from [. . .] Saussurian semiotics to [. . .] the operation of the sign de- scribed by Derrida" (527), she is establishing a similar connection between theory and hermeneutics. Of course, such interpretations need a careful ac- count of the precise function the theory fulfills in the critical text, an account which is often lacking. Such a lack unnecessarily provokes the reproach of circularity. Indeed, circularity there will be, whenever the text is claimed to give evidence for the theory in such a case. But that is not the claim. What is stated is, that the content of the text is, from a certain point of view, the fictional representation of the theory. Ultimately, the text, then, does not illustrate the theory, but the theory the text. Such use of semiotic theory helps to assert the actuality of ancient texts, in that it illuminates general human issues. In this view, modern theories and ancient texts are different but similarly functioning representations, never completely adequate but mutually complementary representations of the knowledge we always strive for, without ever reaching it. And that relation between the poetic discourse, its critical counterpart, and the theoretical discourse is pre- cisely what modern semiotic theory tries to teach us. Instituut voor Theoretische Literatuurwetenschap University of Utrecht NOTES 1 For another excellent account of this myth, and its treatment in Aristophanes* Thesmophori- azousae , see Zeitlin (1981 and 1982). 2 Anachronies is a term in Genette*s narratological system of time analysis. It indicates any non-equivalence between the two time structures of narrative, the time of the fabula (events) and the time of presentation. Needless to say that in this use the term is not normative. 3 Analepsis is Genette*s term for a backward-anachrony. 4 E.g., the Günther Müller Schule, whose works cover a wide range of applications of Müller*s theory of duration , which has been more systematically elaborated by Genette. Müller and his followers are often accused of 'sterile line-counting,* and rightly so; seen in context, however, their works had a pioneering function as they tried to make their analyses more or less empirical. A second mainstream was initiated by Eberhard Lämmert in the fifties, whose work covers the area of Genette*s category of order . Genette has sometimes been accused of imitating Müller and Lämmert. Such accusations, however, are based on a deep misjudgment of the enormous difference in theoretical status. Genette turns the merely intuitive ideas of the German school into a logically rigorous system which includes the category of frequency, never before taken into consideration. Of course, Genette acknowl- edges the works of his predecessors.</page><page sequence="18">134 Mieke Bal 3 Genette 's study was translated into English rather late. I use it as a representative example of narratology, because it is systematic and instrumental and because it displays exactly that fruitful interaction between theory-building and text-analysis which is the justification of the present special issue of this journal. The qualities of Genette's book are unquestion- able, but it can, of course, be criticized. Criticism is needed mainly for the two final chapters, and not so much for the chapters on time. 6 See footnotes 2 and 3. The overlapping of the three categories of time is understandable in terms of the basic subjectivity of semiosis for which I will argue in this comment. By no means does it invalidate Genette's analysis. 7 The different possibilities of duration are spelled out by Genette as follows. Starting from a relative degree zero or scenic representation, where TN (narrative time) is assumed to cover TF (fabula time) four figures of duration are possible: ellipse: TN &lt; oo TF (TN=0; TF=n) summary: TN &lt; TF slow down: TN &gt; TF diegetic pause: TN &gt; oo TF ' Figures of frequency are: nN/nF (plural singulative: plural representation of all numbers of plural events, in equal number of occurrences). mN/nF (plural representation of plural events, in unequal number). nNlF (repetition: more representations of one event). lN/nF (iteration: one representation of more events). 9 The term authentication has been elaborated in an interesting article by Doležel (1979) which is of great importance to the study of classical epic. 10 Tsotopy* is a more appropriate term than either 'code,* which I will discuss below, or semantic field/ which is still a bit vague. See for a theory of isotopy, Greimas 1966.69-101. 11 In what follows I am condensing arguments extensively discussed in Bal (1983). 12 See for a comprehensive study of this device, Dällenbach 1978. For a critical account of that study, and further possibilities, see Bal (1979). 13 Zeitlin (1981) also discusses Helen, and the parody of Euripides* Helen in Aristophanes* play, in these terms of transgression of clear-cut boundaries, speaking of the "equivalence of intertextuality and intersexuality.** She stresses the importance of the body for this mythical equivalence: "In the corporeal essence, she [Helen] functions both as the psychological subject and as the aesthetic object, and the artist needs her to substantiate his own con- ception of his art** (1981:210).
