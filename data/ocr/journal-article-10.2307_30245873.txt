<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Harris Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv ABSTRACT The city's motto "I will build you and you will be rebuilt," from Jeremiah (31:4) is confronted and even challenged in literary depictions of Tel-Aviv. The mythology prevalent in the city's creation narrative is shattered through the use of urban tropes, such as the street, prostitution, urban sprawl, and the protagonist's isolation, and even eventual suicide, in fictional texts from the 1970s onwards. This article examines texts by Ya'akov Shabtai, Binya- min Tammuz, Yehudit Katzir, and Etgar Keret in which Tel-Aviv, in failing the unique ideology of the first Jewish city, becomes the genuine urban experience for which it was intended-a city like any other. "THIS CITY DOESN'T DESERVE TO EXIST. THIS IS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING"' THE FOUNDING AND GROWTH OF TEL-AVIV REVERBERATED WITH THE ideology of Jewish national revival and the quest to build a modern Jewish city different than both the Jewish shtetl in East Europe and the cities of the Levant. The Tel-Aviv creation narrative focused positively on the construc- tive energies of urban pioneers engaged in building the first Hebrew city.2 Although criticism of Tel-Aviv, mainly from the labor Zionist estab- lishment (which preferred an agricultural ideal) existed from the very beginning of the city's construction, forbidding descriptions of the urban landscape were rarer in fiction and poetry. It was not until the 197os-late by comparison with portrayals of the city evident in Europe-that writ- ers adopted negative universal urban topoi, widespread in European and American literature, to depict Tel-Aviv. Imagery representing the urban 75</page><page sequence="2">76 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 environment as a place of alienation, decay, disillusionment, and failure, with its attendant sexual, financial, and moral corruption, has been adopted and adapted in Israeli fiction. Writers increasingly depict Tel-Aviv society as decadent and corrupt; the city is portrayed as a monster; while the flJneur protagonist is shown to be isolated and alone. The city is depicted frequently with dark, forbidding streets, and a seedy underworld dense with corruption and prostitution.3 Given the powerful Zionist rhetoric of Tel-Aviv in its foundational phase, in adopting modernist urban tropes in literary depictions of Tel- Aviv, authors were engaged in challenging the traditional Zionist narrative of Tel-Aviv, even suggesting that the city did not stand up to its reputation as a thriving metropolis or that Tel-Aviv betrayed the Zionist ideals that underlay its building. In this article, I consider four literary works that share the centrality of Tel-Aviv in the narrative and the suicide of one or more protagonists in the novel: Ya'akov Shabtai, Past Continuous (1977), Binya- min Tammuz, Requiem for Na'aman (1978, 1992), Yehudit Katzir, Closing the Sea (1990), and Etgar Keret, Kneller's Happy Campers (2000). Within these texts, the dark portrayal of Tel-Aviv indicates the real- ization of the mythological city first imagined in literary form. Tel-Aviv's success lies in its normalization and similarity to other modern cities. Lit- erary depictions of negative urban tropes challenge the city's mythological foundations but reinforce the claim that Tel-Aviv is indeed a city like any other. By emulating Western models, the real city echoes universal urban locations. Nevertheless, even in the later literature of the 1990s and zooos, it is clear that Hebrew fiction acknowledges the distinctly local characteristics ofTel-Aviv. In adopting urban literary topoi to convey Tel-Aviv, Israeli writ- ers present a new city while simultaneously reinforcing an old idea: Tel-Aviv is a hybrid between East and West, myth and reality. NOSTALGIA FOR THE LOST CITY OF TEL-AVIV Set in Tel-Aviv in the I970s, Shabtai's Past Continuous describes three dis- contented middle-aged friends (Goldman, Israel, and Caesar) and the founding generation of their parents. The novel opens with the death of Goldman's father, and the information that Goldman commits sui- cide exactly nine months later. As a result, all the events in the novel are presented in this framework of death. In a form of escapism, Past Continuous reflected the nostalgic attitude that had started in the 1930os in the longing for the "small and intimate</page><page sequence="3">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 77 neighborhood where everyone knew everyone else".4 By constructing "a monolithic and naive panoramic picture with sand dunes, white buildings, blue sea, and sky", Shabtai reinforced a myth echoing the "messianic and utopian spirit that ha[d] pervaded the entire Zionist project".' Thus Shabtai tapped into both the reality of the 197os and the idealized attitude towards Tel-Aviv's early years. Shabtai's immortalization ofTel-Aviv juxtaposes the sense of the decay- ing city of the 1970s with a nostalgia-laden perception of Tel-Aviv's foun- dational era during the protagonist Goldman's youth. Through Goldman, Shabtai presents the longing for a childhood landscape that has now been vanquished: "The empty lots and gardens and parks and little woods and virgin fields . .. had now disappeared and given way to streets lined with apartment complexes and offices and commercial and industrial areas."6 This depiction corresponds to the "Nostalgic sentimentality [that] was prevalent mainly among old-time residents, for whom the disappearing cityscapes were associated with the geography of childhood."7 The novel's popularity and canonical status derive from Shabtai's encapsulation of the labor-oriented elite's fears in a period when the decline of the political and cultural hegemony of the labor movement became increasingly manifest. The novel's nostalgic longing represented this particular moment in Tel-Aviv history and contrasted sharply with the city's previous politi- cal narrative that celebrated urban development. In 1951 a monument to commemorate Tel-Aviv's founders "told the story of Tel-Aviv as one of the transformation of a sandy wilderness into a blossoming, modern city".8 Yet, in Shabtai's novel, the anthropomorphic descriptions of the city as a "crazy creature" expanding over the "vineyards and the melon patches" distresses the character Baruch Chaim. Unable to keep up "with all the new houses and roads and factories", Baruch Chaim represents a challenge to Tel-Aviv's "build and be built" mythology-a triumphant construction narrative offi- cialized in the city's motto. Shabtai inverts this narrative in Past Continuous, suggesting that the building ofTel-Aviv had a destructive effect on the local landscape. Moreover, the story documents a sense of estrangement from the city: " [H] is pride was mixed with a feeling of distress because the city was slipping away from him and making him feel like a stranger."' This ambivalence towards the city's formation also integrates the tra- ditional topos of alienation within the urban landscape. As Goldman wit- nesses the process of deterioration and destruction in the city, he conflates the annihilation of the old landscape with the influx of a new population: "The town, which in the course of a few years had been filled with tens of thousands of new people, who in Goldman's eyes were invading outsiders</page><page sequence="4">78 ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 turned him into a stranger in his own city."'1 Georg Simmel observed the alienating effect of the thronging metropolis, where strangers lived side by side.1' However, for Goldman the strangers were newcomers and invaders: his alienation evinced a sense of loss of familiarity with "his city". By portraying a space filled with strangers as well as longing for the sands of the nostalgic past, Shabtai contests the success of building some- thing new and wholesome in Tel-Aviv, a city that would be "[S]omething clean, beautiful and healthy." It seemed wrong-"anti-Zionist"-to exchange the conditions of a European ghetto for a Middle Eastern one.12 Shabtai's novel confronts this vision of a modern city through Grandma Clara's despair. After having dragged Grandpa David from the Diaspora because of her involvement with groups promoting a "Love of Zion", she is soon disheartened to discover the discrepancy between her dreams and the reality. [A] mong the square white houses and glaring wastes of sand which got into her shoes, and sometimes even into her food, in the harsh light of the sun, in the dusty, fly-filled heat, she felt alien and deceived, and many years had to pass for this feeling to fade a little and lose its sharpness, but in the mean- time she expressed her disappointment in a stream of Yiddish and Polish and Russian curses and a flood of abuse and angry, indignant complaints.'3 In this dystopian representation of the city under construction, Tel-Aviv was an exhausting, ugly, and chaotic place. The sand in Grandma Clara's shoes, the symbol of the desert and the Orient, indicates that the city had not become the European metropolis that it was intended to be. Simulta- neously, the use of Yiddish, Polish, and Russian curses signifies Tel-Aviv's failure to escape the burdens of European ghetto life. For Goldman, the sand's reappearance is both nostalgic and a challenge to the narrative of its banishment in the emergent metropolis. Instead, the city is being consumed by the sands which cannot be held at bay. TEL-AVIV-THE MONSTER CITY Despite early appearances, the city's encroachments over nature in Baruch Chaim's depictions, and the encroachment of the sands over the city in Grandma Clara's observations, highlight the city's constant battle with the hostile landscape. Ultimately Tel-Aviv becomes a ravenous force consum- ing everything in its path, leaving destruction in its wake. This widespread</page><page sequence="5">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 79 depiction of the city as a destructive monster is a trope commonly found in Modernist art and literature. Examples include Baudelaire's images of the city as a whore in Les Fleurs du Mal, the Moloch Machine in Fritz Lang's 1927 landmark Modernist film Metropolis, and the tension of John Huston's 1950 film noir classic The AsphaltJungle.' 4 The "symbolic speech of the city as 'moloch,' 'whore,' 'labyrinth,' or 'asphalt jungle' " according to Klaus Scherpe: "tries to master the complexity of the modern metropolis in an atavistic manner, by reducing it to elementary formulas"."5 This effect is achieved by describing the city as a terrifying creature; as Raymond Wil- liams has shown, the city becomes "a destructive animal, a monster, utterly beyond the individual human scale".16 Yehudit Katzir's 1990 novella Closing the Sea about Ilana, a school teacher from Haifa who visits Tel-Aviv for the day, develops this primordial imagery in her bestial representations of the Dizengoff Center in Tel-Aviv. Ilana's emotional crisis and subsequent suicide occur following her visit to Tel-Aviv and the failure of her plans to see a childhood friend and experi- ence the promised delights of the city. Katzir belongs to a new generation of authors including Etgar Keret and Gadi Taub who describe Israel in tropes reminiscent of American literature.17 Published during the 1990s, these writers have been nicknamed the "thin language" generation for their representation of contemporary life in Israel using the vernacular. Katzir represents a trend of Americanizing Hebrew literature which, according to Miri Kubovy, includes "an increasing number of American themes, characters, landscapes, and experiences [...] usually [presented] in contrast to Israeli reality".18 Katzir denotes aspects of American consumerism in her depiction of Tel-Aviv's Dizengoff Center, Israel's first mall. The Dizengoff Center's mani- festation as a "great white beast" reveals a conception of Tel-Aviv's savage nature."9 Eventually, Ilana's awe and praise for the American style shopping mall turns to dread as she becomes alarmed and confused by the chaos: She didn't know which side of the beast she was on now, the front legs or the hind legs, but her own legs hurt, and her stomach was cramped and her head was spinning and her eyes needed to be shut.20 Ilana's hysterical breakdown is triggered by the city's dynamism and her visceral response to the shopping center's monstrosity. Katzir's use of the Dizengoff Center engages with Israelis' nuanced perceptions ofTel-Aviv's success in the 1980s and 199Os. At first, Ilana celebrates the Center's external appearance; once inside, however, Ilana's experience is one of terror and</page><page sequence="6">80 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 horror. She buys an expensive and inappropriate dress from a macabre shop assistant, and then in a moment of hysteria is unable to find the shop again when she decides to return the dress. Finally she finds the shop but is unable to return the item. A series of ghoulish scenes reinforce the mall's sinister nature. In the bathroom stall Ilana finds graffiti describing a lurid sexual act, with her name and a telephone number attached. She feels assaulted and violated by this message on the wall. There is no respite from the hor- rors of the beast. Instead of a relaxing caf6, she is consigned to the neon lit food court, and a drink that fails to quench her thirst. Concurrently, she listens to widows as they discuss their husbands' lives and deaths in grisly detail. Through this image of the Dizengoff Center that engenders panic- stricken terror in Ilana, Katzir suggests Tel-Aviv's corruption is evidenced in its materialistic consumerism and disregard for the welfare of others. Katzir's contrast between the external image of the shopping mall and the horrors found within echo Grandma Clara's disappointment in Shabtai's novel, that Tel-Aviv has failed to escape the Levant and to fulfill the promises of its founders to build a European modern city. Clara's con- tact with the flies and sand disgusts her; a sensory relationship evident in both novels. Tel-Aviv's squalid and visceral reality assaults Ilana's senses of smell, touch, sight, hearing, and taste from her very first moments in the city: The bus reached the Central Bus Station and opened its doors with a hiss of relief. Ilana got out, and the hot heavy air enveloped her in a sticky embrace, with the smells of urine and nutshells and frying oil and the shouts of fruit vendors and people selling cassettes, and noises too ornate, like the Oriental sweets she had never learned to like. At the base of the dirty green columns sat blind old men or amputees.21 The city is dirty and the air suffocating. The violent smells and the shouts of vendors over a background noise of Mizrahi music, represented by the selling of cassettes, indicate the Levantine character of the city. The image of the amputees sitting against the pillars evokes European shtetl life and Arab cities. This picture challenges the Tel-Aviv mythology in early posters, photographs, and Gutman's drawings of cool boulevards on which elegantly attired men and women promenade.22 Instead, the city now resembles the early twentieth-century Jaffa that Tel-Aviv had tried to escape.</page><page sequence="7">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 81 BUILDINGS AND DEATH: PHYSICAL DECAY Central to Shabtai's novel is the city's decay. In describing the urban land- scape, he suggests the buildings are monuments to European architecture that had once "attempted to imitate the architectural beauties and splendors of Europe, in the style of Paris or Vienna or Berlin, or even of castles and palaces". Instead, the city's putrefaction is seen in the buildings' collapse: "All these buildings no longer had any future because they were old and ill adapted to modern tastes and lifestyles ..."23 The narrative of Tel-Aviv as "the white city" with new, modern build- ings contrasts with the decay of the city-through the image of death. Death takes two forms; that of the city and that of individuals. In the first, there is the detailed representation of the city's cemeteries. Shabtai's novel and Amos Gitai's 1995 film adaptation Devarim open with the surreal hunt through the city's graveyards to find Goldman's father's funeral. Unable to meet up with the mourners at the cemetery, Israel and Casesar's return to Goldman's apartment metaphorically extends these sites of death to include the whole city. The juxtaposition of the tombstones against the city's high-rise buildings in Gitai's film symbolize "the feeling that nothing has really been achieved".24 The search through the cemeteries and among the tombstones parallels Goldman's own aimless wandering through the city. Goldman roves among the white Bauhaus buildings of Tel-Aviv lamenting the loss of his childhood world-a place of Zionist commitment to build- ing a new society, of hope and innocence. In this flJnerie, the city becomes a figurative cemetery: "This is already not my city, and she will never be. This is just rubbish [...] this city doesn't deserve to exist. This is just a misunderstanding. [.. .] This is just nothingness. This is a graveyard."25 Nathan Zach and Lev Hakak have each argued that the death of indi- viduals has permeated Israeli fiction since the 1970s. This preoccupation "with madness, suicide, murder, alienation-in sum, with the dreadful aspects of life" represents the disparity between the hopes and dreams of Zionism and the reality of the state in its early years.26 Writing about Tel- Aviv has used the suicide of individuals (along with other forms of death) to convey disillusionment with the city. Katzir's main protagonist Ilana dies after a day in Tel-Aviv, and at least 24 characters die in Shabtai's novel. Death saturates the text, as illustrated by Zipporah, Goldman's aunt. She visits the graves of the many characters who die in the course of the narrative: "Until in the end the dead enmeshed her life in so dense a web that one day, in an hour of repose, she said humor- ously to Uncle Lazar, that with so many dead people and so many visits to</page><page sequence="8">82 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 graveyards it sometimes seemed to her that she herself was already dead."27 In each of the novels explored in this article at least one central protagonist dies by suicide. In stark contrast to the optimistic, future-oriented "build and be built" ideal, both the city and the individual are doomed. The images of Tel-Aviv as a necropolis are even more menacing in literature of the 199os. In Closing the Sea Katzir even suggests that the city is killing its inhabitants by sucking the life out of them. [Ilana] tried to admire the fountain that spins and plays music, [...] but her eyes were drawn instead to the old people sitting on the hard cement benches around it. The sun hung over them in the steamy air like a round lemon drop sucking whatever sap they still had left.28 Etgar Keret extends this image in his fantastical novella Kneller's Happy Campers, published in 2000. This darker, sinister view depicts the city as an endless nightmare in which all of the characters are already dead, having committed suicide-and are now living in Tel-Aviv. Tel-Aviv is a symbolic hell and the whole city has become an inescapable place of death. Just as Katzir describes the Dizengoff Center as admirable because it is "just like in America", so too, in Keret's depiction of Tel-Aviv, the city has lost its distinct character as a Hebrew or Jewish city.29 Keret's Tel-Aviv unites specific local indicators with aspects of a universal metropolis. He compares the city to Frankfurt, thereby denying the distinctly Hebrew aspect of Tel-Aviv which early Zionist ideology had celebrated as its essen- tial feature. Haim, the main protagonist in Keret's novel, works in a pizza parlor that is part of a chain. Haim's flat-mate is a German who also works at the pizzeria. His flatmate's statement that the area reminds him of his home merely compounds the effect; Tel-Aviv seems just like Frankfurt. The definitive criticism of Tel-Aviv comes when Haim remarks that Frankfurt too must be "a hole".30 Haim and his friend Ari conclude that now that they are dead, Tel- Aviv is barely inferior to the afterworld: "This place is just like where I came from, only a bit worse."3' Keret's novella was written two decades after Shabtai's novel, which opens with an explanation of Goldman's father's death and Goldman's death nine months later narrated by Caesar. Keret depicts a similar opening: "Two days after I committed suicide", but it is now the protagonist who is narrating-there is no one else left alive to tell the story. Keret expands upon the image constructed by Shabtai, ofTel-Aviv as a cemetery.32 In this dystopia the city is no longer just a symbolic grave- yard, the last resting place of ideological dreams; it is the place after death.</page><page sequence="9">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 83 Tel-Aviv becomes the figurative punishment meted out to people who have taken their own lives. In this allegory of Tel-Aviv, Keret is suggesting that the "Hebrew City" has become a place of the living dead. TEL-AVIV AS A PLACE OF CORRUPTION The city's physical decay is also a metaphor for the decay of human beings through moral, sexual, and financial corruption. Even in the early years, literary depictions of Tel-Aviv contested the city's claims to foster Zionist ideals of national revival. S.Y. Agnon's novel Only Yesterday (1945) illustrates the disillusionment of the second Aliyah who perceived the city to be a betrayal of Zionist ideology. Agnon's anti-hero Yitzhak Kumer is unable to work the land due to competition from the cheaper and more efficient Arab laborers. Offered the opportunity to find alternative work in the city or flee to Jerusalem, Yitzhak abandons secular socialist Zionism and returns to a religious world. Benjamin Tammuz was a significant figure within the Israeli literary and cultural establishment, and he articulates the same questioning atti- tude towards the city that Agnon had demonstrated. In his novel Requiem for Na'aman (1978, republished 1992), Tammuz traces the lives of four generations of the Abramson family from the first Zionist immigrants to Palestine at the end of the late 19th century to the generations of the I96os and early 1970s. Reacting to Tel-Aviv's petit-bourgeois nature, the idealist Elyakum asks: "Think for yourselves and answer me: was it worth it to come to swamps and malaria and murders, in order to be lawyers and to work in a bank?"33 Both Agnon and Tammuz echo critical attitudes toward the bourgeois vision underlying Tel-Aviv. This criticism had already appeared in the 192os, when Tel-Aviv's increasingly petit-bourgeois character was seen as an anathema to Zionists believing in the redemptive power of rural, cooperative settlement. Though celebrated as a bourgeois city, Labor Zionism was also an important aspect of I93os and 1940s Tel-Aviv. Notably, the workers' housing represented an attempt to "implement a collective or communal ideal in the construction of residential neighborhoods".34 In the spirit of the Bauhaus school, architects designed buildings to "encourage a sense of community that would foster working-class solidarity and nurture the kind of individu- als who would grow into and participate in proletarian societies".35 Nev- ertheless, within 40 years of this construction period, Shabtai wrote about what he perceived to be the failure to realize these urban socialist ambitions.</page><page sequence="10">84 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 He relates the incidental story of Goldman's father and his friend Leviathan in Past Continuous. Horrified by Tel-Aviv's development, the two men attempt to found a new urban-collective city. They spend two years draw- ing up the charter, "which embraced all aspects of individual, family and social life; took into account all the rights and obligations of the members and all the problems and deviations which might confront them".36 However, the lack of commitment to the project results in its ultimate failure. This allegory contends that Goldman's generation abandoned their Zionist ideals (and for Shabtai this meant a socialist Zionist framework) and as a result, Tel-Aviv failed to live up to their vision of the city. A second allegorical representation of Tel-Aviv appears in Goldman's translation of Prevlova; a fantastical world. This allegory of the city as a malevolent place is found after Goldman's suicide, and consequently, Goldman's death is associated with the city's horrors. Prevlova's inhabitants are rootless hordes, challenging Tel-Aviv's self-image as a Jewish homeland that offers an alter- native and even an end to diasporic wanderings. T1he bodies in this fantasti- cal land live for a single day, but expand to hideous proportions, fed by the decadence of the city, finally dying and rotting. "The creatures that remain floating on the surface of the water are boiled by the midday sun and serve as nourishment for the approaching hordes of nomads."37 Decay is not just the state of the landscape, but the condition of the individual. As a com- ment on Tel-Aviv, Shabtai suggests through this story that each successive generation leaves behind nothing of substance or meaning. Goldman's suicide is an expression of this betrayal of values and failure to realize the urban socialist vision. The urban dwellers in post-I970 literature fill their lives in a variety of ways, through sexual pleasures, business, and consumerism, but these are shown to be corrupt forces that are inherently destructive. The centrality of the city's sexual corruption extends metaphors of Tel-Aviv's decline. Sexual depravity in the novels compromises ideological promises for a new Jewish future with its wholesome overtones. In Closing the Sea, Ilana is confronted by images of naked breasts on the magazine covers at the kiosk in the bus station or the sexual suggestions in the Dizengoff Center bathroom. On her return journey from the city a religious man sits next to her in the shared taxi, covers his knees with his coat and, while feeling Ilana's thigh, proceeds to masturbate. On arriving home Ilana undresses, wishing to wash away the physical and symbolic pollutions of Tel-Aviv. She cannot be cleansed and lying in the bath, she drowns. Licentiousness and sexual immorality indicate Tel-Aviv's corruption, according with Raymond William's view of the city as a place of waste and</page><page sequence="11">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 85 profligacy represented through promiscuity, prostitution, and pornogra- phy.38 Through Caesar, images of bizarre, sordid, or depraved pornography pervade Shabtai's novel. The many literary depictions of sex and prostitu- tion symbolize the betrayal of Tel-Aviv's Zionist ideals in two ways. Firstly, the reality cannot match the expectations of fantasy, and so in turn, the characters increasingly become sexually depraved. Secondly, the liaisons do not lead to offspring. Even when Israel's girlfriend is pregnant he rejects her and she moves to Jerusalem, suggesting Tel-Aviv cannot sustain new life. Prostitution is a universal theme of the urban environment. Richard- son, Fielding, and other eighteenth century British novelists were quick to use this image, and it was not until a century later that prostitution featured in French literature.39 In English literature, prostitution depicted a chang- ing fate for women (as with Fanny Burney's Evelina) from which they could rise and return to society, or sink into obscurity or death. It was not until the late nineteenth century, with the rise of modernism, that the prostitute became a vehicle for representing "male fantasies about female sexuality", a depiction that served "to focus male ambivalence about desire, money, class, and the body." 40 In Tel-Aviv fiction, suicide and prostitution are paralleled, becoming dominant images of the corruption of the city. Shabtai's use of prostitution reflects the demise of the puritanical and idealistic ethos that characterized the early pioneering phase of the Tel-Aviv Zionist narrative. Goldman's constant pursuit of prostitutes is frequently humiliating. In his first encounter the woman took his money but "all she let him do was embrace her a little and touch her breasts through her dress and kiss her once or twice".41 On another occasion, Goldman "once received a beating on account of a prostitute". Goldman's sexual relationship with Paula, the hostess of a nightclub, also suggests prostitution. Many of his sexual acts with Paula are conducted in public among other middle-aged men "who had come to find a little release and a little happiness in the company of the hostesses".42 Goldman's encounters with Paula are squalid and transi- tory, as is the social situation in which the hostesses operate. Goldman's experience with Paula is unfulfilling despite his hopes that such an act of sexual debauchery will fulfill his desires and his fantasies. "After it was over he was left with nothing but the sense of shame and sin, and a feeling of disappointment, because none of it bore any resemblance to the wild sexual fantasies which he cultivated in his imagination."43 As a child, Goldman saw his neighbor, the prostitute Kaminskaya- whom he lusted after, commit suicide. Her sexual promise is unattainable because he is too young at first, and then because she dies. Like the Tel-Aviv dream, she is forever out of reach. Unlike his father, he is attracted rather</page><page sequence="12">86 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 than repelled by prostitutes, indicating the moral breakdown between generations. Goldman's father violently opposes prostitution, which he considers to be moral decay. Furthermore, Goldman's ambivalent attitude contrasts with his father's attitude suggesting that the current generation is no longer morally virtuous, and has failed the founding generation of Tel-Aviv. Arguments advocating prostitution echo arguments advocating suicide in Shabtai's novel. Goldman rationalizes his reason for the former, simulta- neously giving arguments that are used for the latter: The naivete of Gold- man's argument is at once evident, yet he is using prostitution only as a way of illustrating his more important argument about the lack of culpability for suicide. The pursuit of prostitutes, like his subsequent suicide, reveals his disdain for the morality of the collective. In prostitution, sexual acts no longer have procreative properties. Therefore, the association with suicide indicates the material death of the city and of its ideals. Sexual depravity and the ambiguous moral attitudes toward it prefigure the popular concep- tions of Tel-Aviv in the I98os and 1990s as a "sin city", where transgression of moral conventions is rendered positive, signifying the city's success.44 The pursuits of sexual and financial excess in Shabtai's novel are par- alleled. Caesar feeds Goldman's sexual fantasies with his own licentious behavior. His attitude to sexual relations is merely an extension of his parents', Zena and Erwin's, coupling of sexual and financial excess. Their overindulgence of all things obscures their hatred for one another. Erwin assumes his wife forgets his adulterous betrayal because of her decadent purchases. However, her shopping expeditions barely satisfy her, and her new acquisitions often remain packed in their bags. This representation of consumerist decadence characterized Tel-Aviv throughout its history, with Dizengoff Street "associated with pleasure, entertainment, fun, and consumption".45 However, even Tel-Aviv acquired new dimensions of debauchery and dissolution with the rise of a nouveau riche middle-class in the I96os and 1970s. Tammuz's Requiem for Na'aman explores the image of hyper-con- sumption in his depiction of a generation committed to the good life made possible by an emergent affluent society that was not committed to the puritanical, pioneering ethos. In this novel, the fashionable homes of the upper classes in Tel-Aviv become monuments to consumerism. In a deeply satirical portrayal of wealth, he ridicules the compulsive acquisitions of this class, and those who could not afford full integration into this status and social connection, and therefore choose their own systems of imitation in order to compete in this hierarchy.</page><page sequence="13">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 87 In all the best houses one could find special clay pots, archaeological, bearing the signature of a Minister of Israel; he who knew the Minister personally received such potsherds as a gift; and he who was not so fortunate paid the full price, in shops in New York, when he was on a graduate trip there.46 In describing the archaeological artifacts of Israel, divorced from their religious or social context, which become objects of social status, Tammuz suggests the dislocation between a genuine interest in the history of the national homeland and its use as a status symbol. Furthermore, the items are purchased in New York. The owners have not excavated the Land of Israel to find these treasures, because they do not work the land and are removed from it physically and ideologically. Yet, his description of this social class still ties consumerism to unique aspects of local Canaanite or Palestine archaeology.47 The items belong to the Land of Israel and hence status is still measured by an ideological connection. However, in Shabtai's novel, even this final link to Zionism is severed. The artifacts mentioned in Past Continuous are African masks, or items from Asia, China, and the Far East, demonstrating the disconnection between national ideals and Tel-Aviv society. In Shabtai's novel, financial corruption in the city is also a mark of moral decay, symbolized by Max Spillman. Max lives in an unnecessarily lavish accommodation, "a five-room apartment in one of the expensive new buildings", contrasting the modest socialist housing values employed in Tel-Aviv's Bauhaus period.48 Spillman has been convicted for corrup- tion: he diluted petrol with paraffin and tampered with the indicators on the pumps; yet even after being tried, convicted, and fined, he feels no remorse because he neither believes the crime is serious or that he will be punished for it. Even his customers do not consider his actions to be "an unpardonable sin, but at the very most as an unfortunate slip which should be forgotten as soon as possible and which was no reason for upset- ting their relationship with him". Spillman represents Tel-Aviv's moral corruption: "Even the devil has run away and left them in the hands of a rabble of animals like Max Spillman and all kinds of mad dogs who called themselves Jews.""49 Tammuz similarly describes fashionable Tel-Aviv society's financial duplicity during the relatively affluent and politically stable I96os and 1970s, when traditional ideals of selfless service eroded, giving way to cynicism and the pursuit of personal gains: They "take something from the party coffer, or exert pressure on contractors and accept what are called bribes".5" The new elite behaved in fraudulent ways by letting their self-interest triumph</page><page sequence="14">88 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 over moral obligations to the collective: "People who all their lives only gave and gave and gave to the nation, to the State and to the party, why should they not enjoy a little bit for themselves in their old age, in Switzerland?" Not only do they steal for personal gain, they abandon the entire Zionist project in moving to Europe. Tammuz's equation of ideological and finan- cial corruption indicates the demise of the Zionist foundational ethos.51 Tammuz and Shabtai's representations of Tel-Aviv anticipate the cel- ebration of sin and hedonism that particularly characterizes the public dis- course of Tel-Aviv from the late I98os. Though Tel-Aviv's vibrant nightlife had informed the city's reputation since the 193os, by 1989, "The Nonstop City" had become its official slogan.52 But in Katzir's representation of I980s Tel-Aviv, Ilana's failure to enjoy her time in the city renowned for its goodtime atmosphere demonstrates the failure to access the "nonstop city" advertised by its slogan. Ilana hopes to shop for a fashionable dress that she will be able to wear later that evening for her meeting with her child- hood friend Tami. She plans to sit in a caf6 and stroll along the seashore. Coerced into buying a prohibitively expensive dress, that is unattractive and entirely unsuitable for her lifestyle, she is then unable to afford lunch in a caf6. She opts to eat unsatisfying fast food while perched on plastic chairs. The failure to satisfy her thirst is made worse by the oppressive heat, forc- ing her to acknowledge the impossibility of roaming through Tel-Aviv in order to reach the seafront as she had dreamed, and so she aborts this plan. Finally her friend fails to appear for the planned meeting and when she does arrive cannot stay; instead she drives Ilana to the Central Bus Station for her return journey to Haifa. THE TEL-AVIV FLANEUR In Shabtai's novel, the anti-hero Goldman appears always as "a man walk- ing, as if alone, in its streets".53 This depiction is part of a literary tradition in which isolated and significant objects and iconic images are used to indicate the "separated subjectivity of the observer".54 Goldman exempli- fies a pattern of isolation evident in other characters in the novel and he, like Baruch Chaim, experiences a sense of alienation in the city. Shabtai casts Goldman as the traditional Europeanffineur (the stroller). Coined by Walter Benjamin in his analysis of Baudelaire's nineteenth century poetry of Paris, and Edgar Allen Poe's story "The Man of the Crowd" (I840), this figure becomes an urban explorer wandering through the city analyzing the landscape as he promenades without purpose, resisting incorporation into</page><page sequence="15">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 89 the milieu, forever standing on the edge of a crowd, isolated and alone. Goldman's endless fldnerie (stroll) that forms the spine of Shabtai's novel, denotes the loneliness of the protagonist, even suggesting imminent death. Goldman wanders through the city in a trance and begins a dialogue with the streets. He considers Yarkon Street despicable and frightening, its associations of prostitution engendering a feeling of terror and shame. Instead of representing the wholesome new society, Shabtai represents the street as a place of decay and immorality that at once attracts and repels Goldman. He formulates theoretical arguments to justify his increasingly corrupt conduct: "The only morality acceptable to him as a non-believer did not repudiate prostitution, or adultery."" Instead of religion, which he refers to as conventional morality, he prefers to adopt "humanistic" moral- ity based on reason with no social limits. Hence Goldman can justify all behavior as he gropes at random for experiences that become unfulfilling. The only boundaries are those represented by the walls and buildings of the city. "The girls standing with their little handbags on the corners or in the doorways of the gloomy old buildings [. . .] most of which were in darkness so that they looked as if nobody lived in them and all they contained were broken bits of furniture and dust and cobwebs and evil spirits."56 These signs of moral and physical decay are at once inviting and repellent. Goldman as fldneur is tortured by the ugliness he witnesses in his soul, which is reflected back in the depictions of the city. For Goldman this negative aspect of Tel-Aviv suggests the entire city is abandoned. Tel- Aviv has become a ghost town, haunted by evil spirits assuming the form of living people, or the specter of things past. Only individuals without the ties of family or community can operate in this Tel-Aviv. The city's curse lies in its ability to feed every caprice while ensuring that city dwellers are always missing something else. There is no satisfaction in any pleasure, since any decision closes off other options. Cities intensify the human condition of missed opportunities, choices, and inaccessibility. "Every glimpsed interior, every passerby, every figure in a distant window, every row of doors, every map itself is both an invitation and a rebuff."57 The fear that something may be missed becomes the final paralyzing terror for the characters of Shabtai's novel. As a result, they grope at random, trying to fill and fulfill their lives.</page><page sequence="16">90 * ISRAEL STUDIES, VOLUME 14, NUMBER 3 DESTRUCTION OF "TEL-AVIVNESS", CREATION OF "A CITY" In Keret's recent novella, Haim thinks that life is meaningless and pointless, that "nothing matters".58 Haim eventually gains wisdom, understanding life's significance and choosing action rather than the passivity of the living dead. His previous powerlessness and obsession with questions about the purpose of remaining alive are transformed when he learns that the act of living is the answer. At the story's close Haim believes he has changed his pattern. The woman he likes (Lihah, and not Ergah, with whom he was infatuated, which had led to his suicide) is a person about whom he often thinks. This contrasts his previous "dreaming". "I don't dream about her at all, but I think about her a lot."59 Haim is transformed by choosing life, as suggested by his name. Taking Lihah's advice, he makes a conscious effort to do things differently, to try and live life by the principles that she suggests like, "doing things just slightly wrong so that you know you are living".60 Keret's novel is heir to a literary tradition that rejects the ideological tenets which first formed Tel-Aviv. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the city had been imagined in literary terms that were later conceived of in physical ways. Expressed in various ideological manifestations throughout the cen- tury, fiction continued to question Tel-Aviv's ability to fulfill the founders' visions. Even as the city abandons its heritage as "the first Hebrew city" by becoming a city like any other in Keret's novella, the sense of Tel-Aviv's ultimate success is reinforced. For, as the writers examined here have shown, by using images of the flaneur, sexual decadence, and corruption in the city, Tel-Aviv's universal aspects as a metropolis are celebrated. Although earlier visions of socialism had collapsed, the nature of Tel- Aviv as an international city just like any other; a burgeoning metropolis that fulfilled the "build and be built" philosophy underlying its construc- tion and growth is manifested in the city's very existence. Nevertheless, even at the dawn of the twenty-first century, Keret does not entirely abandon the special nature of the city either; he also highlights those aspects unique to the city's geographical locus. The sea, the streets, and even the characters reflect a modern Israeliness. The juxtaposition of celebrating and criticiz- ing these local regional markers characterizes cities like Tel-Aviv that stand in the shadows of the great metropolises such as Paris, London, or New York: "The underlying idea being that a sense of provincialism and a thirst for recognition are often two sides of the same coin."61 Keret's protagonist Haim is a synonym for the city, for in just surviving Haim and Tel-Aviv</page><page sequence="17">Decay and Death: Urban Topoi in Literary Depictions of Tel-Aviv * 91 fulfill their purpose, while Haim is also a symbol of the Tel-Aviv inhabitant whose life is on one hand modern and urban, and on the other constrained by the particular situation in Israel. Keret's novel argues that neither Haim nor Tel-Aviv is the living dead. Instead, both appear to do things "just slightly wrong" and in doing so demonstrate their existence. T-he city more than deserves to exist-it does exist! It is this literary vision of the city that balances recognizable univer- sal urban topoi and specific local identity symbols. Motifs of decay and death dominate depictions of Tel-Aviv, thereby highlighting the disparity between the early urban pioneers' dream and the modern reality, yet-as the literary imagery shows-Tel-Aviv as a modern metropolis signifies the city's ultimate success.
