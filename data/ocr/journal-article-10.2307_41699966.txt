Editor: Max Peter Baumann. VWB - Verlag für Wissenschaft und Bildung. Berlin 2012. 767 pp. ISSN 0043-8774; ISBN 978-3-86135-826-8. Contents • Max Peter Baumann: "Introduction," 9-11. Abstract : This volume brings together a collection of 33 articles which have been published within the last 1 5 years in the journal the world of music. The original articles appeared as separate contribu- tions to 45 different topical issues of the journal. These reprints reflect a variety of ethnomusicological themes, methods, perspectives and viewpoints. The contributions portray a multifaceted panorama of ethnomusicological research and interest in questions related to music history, musical instruments, genres, and styles in regional and/or national contexts as well as in the creative tension of globalization and transculturalization. Utilizing distinct approaches and addressing a range of different subjects, the authors discuss a variety of topics with reference to the development of particular music traditions - traditions that are re-constructed, imagined, revived or transformed. The contributions show a broad range of interests in music and music developments in continuity, preservation, and intangible cultural heritage. The fields of inquiry range from musical meaning to musical listening, from the dynamic flow of local to those of global processes. Musicians, artifacts, performance practices, music and gender, biographies of musicians, ritual and drama enrich the topics, most of which are based on original field research, observation, and interpretation. All of these contributions are simultaneously involved in debates of selected theoretical issues referring either to the past, present or future of particular music traditions. 7. Aspects of Music History: Archaeology , Iconography, and Transcultural Interest • Arnd Adje Both: "Aztec Music Culture," 14-28. Abstract : This paper reviews the ethnohistoric record of the Aztec music culture that flourished during the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerica, AD 1325-1521. The written sources from the early colo- nial period suggest that among the Aztecs a differentiation was made between temple music practiced by specialized priests and court music practiced by professional musicians. Moreover, information is related on the religious concepts of sound, revealing important insights into the musical knowledge of Late Postclassic Mesoamerica. In this context, also archaeological and music iconographical data is considered [s. abstract the world of music 49, 2007(2):91]. • Gerald Groemer: "The Rise of 4 Japanese Music'," 29-53. Abstract : The term "Japanese Music" ( hõgaku or Nihon ongaku) is today used both in and out of Japan to refer to what is usually treated as a body of music with definable and unique characteristics. These attributes, in turn, are generally thought to relate closely to geographical, psychological, spiritual, or other supra-historical traits of the Japanese land and people. This paper seeks to trace the emergence and growth of the idea of "Japanese music" and to demonstrate that the rise of this concept has de- pended not on eternal structures or immutable "core values" but rather on the specific historical devel- opment of Japanese economics, politics, and culture. It is this historical process that has provided both vol. 52, 2010 (1-3)</page><page sequence="3">2.

Wade: "Performing the Drone in Hindustani Classical Music: What Mughal Paintings Show Us to Hear," 54-68. Abstract This paper explores the history of the adoption of a regional performance practice in Indian music - the use of an instrument solely for the purpose of continuously sounding a drone - into the court music of the Mughal dynasty and thence into North Indian classical music as we know it today. The primary source utilized in this study is visual: miniature paintings produced in the 16th and 17th centuries for the imperial patrons Akhar and Jahangir. After some general observations on recent schol- arly thinking about the history of the drone in Indian music, information gleaned from the paintings is presented. Finally, a possible explanation is offered for the emergence of the West Asian tambür as the instrument for the continuous keeping of the drone [s. abstract the world of music 38, 1996(2):41]. • Bruno Deschênes: The Interest of Westerners in Non- Western Music," 69-79. Abstract : With the current globalization of communications and connections between today's societies, cultures are inevitably influencing each other although not to the same extent. All aspects of today's Western technologies, thoughts, politics, economics, science, arts, music, etc., are permeating many, if not most aspects of all non- Western cultures. In many parts of the world, modernity is equated with Westernization, and many traditions are "trampled" to make way for this so-called Western modernity, which sometimes is equated with some kind of universality. The same phenomenon applies to music as well. In many places, traditional forms of music are now seen by natives as archaic and antiquated. Some are actually altered to conform to the Western paradigm. Over time, these alterations might slow- ly deprive them of their traditional heritage. Nowadays, even when new forms of music are created, they are basically molded to the so-called modern, thus Western standards. Witnessing this trend, some scholars even believe that in some parts of the world, some traditional forms of music are nearly on the verge of being swept away by Westernization. The impression is that non- Western societies are being imposed a one-way form of acculturation, [s. abstract the world of music 47, 2005(3):5]. 2, Musical Instruments: Between Re-contextualization , Imagination , and Modernity • Karl Neuenfeldt: "Good Vibrations? The 'Curious' Cases of the Didjeridu in Spectacle and Therapy in Australia," 82-103. Abstract : The didjeridu dates back at least fifteen hundred years before present in northern Australia. In the last several decades, however, it has come to be used globally and nationally in contexts falling outside the parameters of local, "traditional" Aboriginal musical, socio-cultural, and spiritual practice. The contexts chosen for examination here are spectacle and therapy. I argue that Feld's formulation of a process of "schizophonia to schismogenesis" for how sounds can become distorted when split from their source can also be applied to musical instruments. What is of general interest is the interplay of the curious and the common in the rebirth, refashioning and re-contextualization of a particular musical instrument (or any musical instrument for that matter) which not only helps make music but also helps socially construct and culturally produce meaning and value for those who play it, make it and hear it. What is of a more specific interest is how didjeriduists are using the instrument in ways unforeseen even a decade ago. The didjeridďs trajectory as an instrument, icon and industry is both reflected in and shaped by indeterminant cultural appropriations which operate globally and are enacted primarily by non-Aboriginal people [s. abstract the world of music 40, 1998(2):29.]. • Toru Seyama: "The Re-contextualization of the Shakuhachi (Syakuhati) and its Music from Traditional/Classical into Modern/Popular," 104-17. Abstract : The shakuhachi , a Japanese five-holed vertical bamboo flute, is today not only used in the traditional Japanese music but also featured in various genres of music such as jazz, pop, and rock. Despite the simplicity of the instrument, the shakuhachi can create a rich and complex variety of sounds. It has also a unique historical background in which still exist many unsolved mysteries such as its origin, some religious legends, the lineages of transmission, and the process of dissemination/</page><page sequence="4">22 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) transformation. Having experienced drastic changes in the society since the Meiji Restoration more than 120 years ago, the Japanese are greatly influenced by the West and have modernized through- out the course of history. Although there are people who preserve generations-old traditions, most contemporary shakuhachi performers consider themselves to be free and not confined to restricted repertoires. With the cultural heritage on one hand and the infinite future on the other, the shakuhachi and the performers of the shakuhachi are in a stage of "re-contextualization." They are moving from traditional/classical into modern/popular, in search of the shakuhachi for tomorrow [s. abstract the world of music AO, 1998(2):69]. • Paula Conlon: "The Native American Flute: Convergence and Collaboration as Exemplified by R. Carlos Nakai," 118-31. Abstract : This article will trace the history of the Native American flute with external block, looking at its traditional function, construction, distribution, decline and rejuvenation, culminating with the multi- tiered use of the Native American flute at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Recent developments in the evolution of the Native American flute from a private courtship ritual to a more public expression of Native identity allow for an interaction of musical styles. Ute/Navajo flutist R. Carlos Nakai describes his music as "contemporary traditional," stating that he builds on the memories of his heritage, utilizing the experiences that surround him to revitalize the ancient stories. The efforts of Nakai as an emissary connecting the Native American flute to a myriad of other cultures will be examined [s. abstract the world of music 44, 2002( 1 ):6 1 ] . 3 . Musical Instruments: Beyond the Local and the Global • Rainer Polak: "A Musical Instrument Travels Around the World: Jenbe Playing in Bamako, West Africa, and Beyond," 134-70. Abstract Jenbe drum ensemble music has appeared in a variety of contexts, namely: local family and communal celebrations, state-organized folklore ensembles in West Africa, and West African percus- sion music in the industrialized countries. These contexts of jenbe playing emerged one after the other, partly developing out of one another. However, they did not supersede nor leave each other unaffected. This article studies the reciprocal effects of local, national, and international utilization of the jenbe , il- lustrated by the changes in instrument making in Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali. It argues that only the feedback of local, national, and international jenbe playing has allowed its artistic and professional vitality in urban West Africa to grow [s. abstract the world of music 42, 2000(3): 7]. • Thomas Turino: "The Mbira, Worldbeat, and the International Imagination," 171-92. Abstract : This paper addresses the processes by which a localized indigenous African tradition, the mbira , rose to prominence at the national level in Zimbabwe after the 1960s and became relatively widely diffused throughout the world after the 1970s. It is suggested that this instrument's fit with the mass media and cosmopolitan aesthetics, along with nationalism, were key to the mbira' s transforma- tion from a localist to a world tradition [s. abstract the world of music 40, 1998(2):85]. • Linda Fujie: "Japanese Taiko Drumming in International Performance: Converging Musical Ideas in the Search for Success on Stage," 193-201. Abstract : Since the 1970s groups of taiko drummers, playing various sizes of Japanese traditional drums and other instruments in a choreographed stage presentation, have toured throughout the world and enjoyed unprecedented success in countless festivals and concert halls outside of Japan. Elements of their performance that appeal to international audiences include their emphasis on an aesthetic based on samurai values, an aesthetic that stresses discipline, hard physical and mental training, group coor- dination and perfectionism. Taiko groups illustrate well the convergence of often conflicting musical values in the emergence of local groups on the international stage. What is considered locally important may lose importance before an international audience in favor of a more cliché-oriented "national" im- age [s. abstract the world of music 43, 2001(2+3):93].</page><page sequence="5">2. Contents and Abstracts • 23 4. Sounding Voices: Identity , Spirituality, and Cultural Inheritance • Gregory Barz: "Soundscapes of Disaffection and Spirituality in Tanzanian Kwaya Music," 204-28. Abstract : This article introduces a redefinition of texts and musical repertoires employed by contem- porary choirs in post-independence Tanzania (East Africa). The case studies present everyday sound- scapes, suggesting an ongoing cultural and religious exchange that has long thrived within various forms of African Christianity. Tanzanian kwayas (KiSwahili, "choirs") provide the article's primary source for what Steven Kaplan refers to as indigenous responses to Western Christianity. A primary focus of the article is on the everyday performances of kwaya communities as they confront religious discontent and alienation, and openly question authority of church governance. In addition, the ar- ticle addresses dichotomous constructions - Western vs. African, indigenous vs. non-indigenous, old vs. new, evangelical vs. mainstream - suggesting that within such relationships there is a denial of a kwaya' s contributions to everyday spirituality and a lack of understanding of the development, change, and adaptation experienced by many musical traditions within African contexts [s. abstract the world of music 47, 2005(1 ):5]. • Laura Leante: "Shaping Diasporic Sounds: Identity as Meaning in Bhangra ," 229-52. Abstract : Bhangra originated in India as a male folk dance performed in the villages of Punjab dur- ing the harvest festivities. Following the migrations of Punjabis to Britain, a new form of bhangra , characterized by the encounter between the traditional dance and mainstream Anglo-American popular music, spread through the communities of the Indian diaspora, coming to constitute one of the means for immigrants both to identify themselves as "Punjabis in England" and to reaffirm their tradition and social values. This paper investigates the musical processes through which British bhangra is shaped, the grounds on which the appropriation of mainstream pop takes place and how bhangra contributes to the construction of diasporic identity [s. abstract the world of music 46, 2004(1): 109]. • Dan Bendrups: "Easter Island Music and the Voice of Kiko Pate: A Biographical History of Sound Recording," 253-68. Abstract : This article provides a history of sound recording on Easter Island (Rapanui) through the biography of Rapanui master musician Luis Avaka "Kiko" Pate. Albums of Rapanui music began to appear internationally in the 1970s in the form of field recordings produced by outsider ethnographers and commercial recordings by amateur enthusiasts. In the following decades, Rapanui musicians de- veloped their own interests in sound recording, and many musicians are now fluent in music produc- tion processes. Throughout this history of production, Kiko Pate has played an unparalleled role in determining the ways in which perceived traditional music forms are remembered and recorded. The conceptualization of tradition has become a defining feature of Rapanui culture in the twenty-first cen- tury, and the performances and recordings of new generations of musicians owe much of their success to the earlier revitalization efforts of Kiko Pate. His role in this recording history is, however, not im- mediately apparent because all of the extant recordings featuring Kiko Pate's distinctive voice are the result of outsider research and production emphasize exotic content over performer identity. Through the medium of biography, this article reveals Kiko Pate's presence in Rapanui sound recording history and illuminates many of the factors contributing to the contemporary understanding of music and tradi- tion on Rapanui [s. abstract the world of music 49, 2007( 1 ): 1 25]. 5. Inventing Traditions: Revival , Music Festivals , and Transe ulturalization • Timothy J. Cooley: "Folk Festivals as Modern Ritual in the Polish Tatra Mountains," 270-93. Abstract In this study, I interpret a large annual folklore festival in the Tatra Mountains of Poland as a modern ritual that is similar to more traditionally recognized calendric rituals. Key to my interpreta- tion of festivals is the local history of tourism and the emergence of the tourism as the region's major industry.

Abstract Today regional traditions interrelate with musical diversity, intercultural music making, and improvisation. In an era of tourism, migration, festivals, technologically determined globalization and a world that is growing smaller, the conceptualization of culture and region is expressed through mu- sic in highly differentiated ways. The region in which music is made can be differentiated from the transcultural region, which is represented symbolically through music [s. abstract the world of music 43, 2001(2+3):9]. • Owe Ronström: "Revival Reconsidered," 314-29. Abstract'. The article attempts to overview and discuss some basic traits in the literature on musical revival. Revival of musical forms and styles is an important and wide spread phenomenon that has been studied from a large number of perspectives. Tentatively, the literature can be divided into two main parts, one object-oriented and centering around questions of authenticity, the other process-oriented and centering on revival as symbolic expressions. A large part deals with revival of traditional music. The author argues that in essence revival is a process of traditionalization that goes on in the present, to create symbolic ties to the past, for reasons in the future, and that since such processes is not confined to traditional music only, it is now necessary to study and compare also revivals of other musical genres and forms [s. abstract the world of music 38, 1996(3):5]. 6. Music , Gender, and the Individual Jonathan P. J. Stock: "Toward an Ethnomusicology of the Individual, or Biographical Writing in Eth- nomusicology," 332-46. Abstract : Ethnomusicologists have turned to biography as a result of three trends within the discipline. First, in our fieldwork we encounter and observe musical individuals, sometimes (but not always) in environments where musical individuality is a marked characteristic of the musical culture as a whole. Second, reappraisal of the politics of representation in ethnographic writing has encouraged us to docu- ment more closely the interactions of specific individuals. Finally, new notions of culture themselves place greater emphasis on individual role and agency, thus stimulating us to look at more length at the individual choices made by musicians and others. The writing of biography, nonetheless, has emphases that mark it as partially distinct from ethnographic research, most clearly in its reliance on historical data not observed first-hand by the ethnomusicologist. There may be less space in someone else's life for the participatory and experiential models proposed in recent discussions of fieldwork [s. abstract the world of music 43, 2001(1 ):5]. • Regula Burckhardt Qureshi: "In Search of Begum Akthar: Patriarchy, Poetry, and Twentieth-century Music," 347-86. Abstract'. Begum Akhtar is best known for her sophisticated mastery of Urdu poetry and light classical music in the ghazal of North India and Pakistan. Her musical legacy emerges from a set of relation- ships defined by the elasticity and rigidity of gendered identities in patriarchal, post-colonial Indian society. Situating her artistry in relation to the backdrop of historical forces that framed the course of her career, this paper foregrounds the dynamic changes that confronted a hereditary musical tradition in a fading system of feudal patronage. It also reflexively engages the myriad voices and encounters that have contributed to the evolving discourse that continues to mold Begum Akhtar's remarkable life history [s. abstract the world of music 43, 2001 ( 1 ):97]. • Beverley Diamond: "Native American Contemporary Music: The Women," 387-414.

Ritual and Drama: Observation , Interpretation, and Reconstruction • Regine Allgayer-Kaufmann: "From the Innocent to the Exploring Eye: Transcription on the Defensive," 4 1 6-3 1 . Abstract : From the very first moment on Carl Stumpf and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel started to tran- scribe the music they received from all over the world. They followed the example of musical scores in Western music. Hornbostel believed in the possibility of faithful transcriptions, yet the myth of the innocent eye was not yet exposed as such. Only in the 1950s transcription came under the crossfire of criticism when a new generation of ethnomusicologists challenged - from an anthropological point of view - the usefulness of transcriptions. They argued against ethnocentrism, which in their opinion had shown up here as sound centrism. Anyway, there are still transcribing ethnomusicologists today. In this article we scrutinize closely three examples. Obviously there are many different systems used today analogous to the contents that have become manifold. Aside from this it turns out that ethnomusicolo- gists today do not at all use their transcriptions for exploring, i.e. they do not explore with their eyes, instead, they explore with their ears and their body. The purpose of transcriptions has turned out to be mainly to communicate knowledge that was obtained by these other means. It is finally communicated by transcriptions to those, who give credit to such pictures because they do not have a possibility to experience it otherwise [s. abstract the world of music 47, 2005(2):71]. • Martina Claus-Bachmann: "Kuveni, or the Curse of a Women as a Flashpoint for Music-oriented (Re-)Constructions," 432-52. Abstract. Sadness, tears and a reviled woman's curse are the flash point for this article, which focuses on Kuveni, the legendary foremother of the Sinhalese and the Veddha minority of Sri Lanka. She is an iridescent outline: due to a lack of historically provable evidence, she can be reborn and reconstructed according to the needs and spirit of the time, or of the individual artist of a drama, dance, music, or combined performance of all these together. The article follows a musical line of Kuveni reconstruc- tions, beginning with Kuveni Asne, an orally-transmitted part of the protection ritual Kohomba Kan- kariya. The article also examines a continuation of the Kuveni motif in a postcolonial music drama by distinguished author and actor Henry Jayasena and his composers Mr. Bandara and Lylie Godridge, and engages with a composition and re-interpretation of the story by award-winning composer Diliup Gabadamudalige in a world music context. In addition to making musical observations, the article also illuminates aspects of gender in its examination of facets of the flash point figure Kuveni, and also by reflecting on the contemporary independence of women in the socially critical lyrics of a song by Carlo Fonseka [s. abstract the world of music 46, 2004(3): 15]. • Tiago de Oliveira Pinto: "Healing Process as Musical Drama: The Ebó Ceremony in the Bahian Candomblé of Brazil," 453-73. Abstract : Through music, words and ceremonial actions that communicate with a caboclo , or spiritual being, the sick person is diagnosed and treated in the framework of the ebó ritual, a part of the Afri- can-Brazilian candomblé religion. The actions, texts and toques, or rhythmic patterns, work closely together to bring the person into a trance state and to directly address the causes of his illness. Family members and friends often play a role as well in the ceremony, which frequently treats children and younger people [s. abstract the world of music 39, 1997(1 ):1 1]. 8. Meaning , Style , Genre , and Change • Margaret Kartomi: "Meaning, Style, and Change in Gamalan and Wayang Kulit Banjar Since Their Transplantation from Hindu-Buddhist Java to South Kalimantan," 476-514.</page><page sequence="8">26 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : This article examines the origins and development of a syncretic Hindu-Buddhist-Animist musical theatre form known as wayang kulit Banjar (Banj arese leather puppet shadow theatre), a com- plex combination of word, music, drama, stagecraft, movement and mystical ritual. Transplanted with its accompanying gamalan music from Java in the fourteenth century, it survives to this day among the Banjarese people of South and East Kalimantan, a mainly Malay society which adopted Islam from the sixteenth century. While Muslim influence in wayang kulit Banjar is only superficial, the story lines, puppet characters and texts preserve archaic Buddhist-Hindu-Javanese elements. Drawing on the liter- ary sources as well as fieldwork interviews and recordings of performances, the author analyses the cosmological association and meaning of elements of wayang kulit and gamalan musical style. Tran- scriptions are included of four excerpts from the author's 1993 recording of a Mahâbhârata-plot based shadow play entitled Terfitnah dalam Kejujuran ("Rumors Destroying Honesty"), led by senden da- lang Abdullah and accompanied on a gamalan Banjar [s. abstract the world of music 44, 2002(2): 1 7]. • Sonjah Stanley Niaah: "A Common Space: Dancehall, Kwaito , and the Mapping of New World Music and Performance," 515-30. Abstract : At the interstices of cultural geography and performance studies, this article continues the au- thor's earlier research and writing on Jamaica's dancehall culture, and analyzes the applicability of in- sights gained to other black performance genres, most notably South African kwaito. Through research methods including interviews and participant observation, a comparative perspective on dancehall and kwaito reveals unexplored parallels, particularly ideological and spatial ones. I therefore expand the focus beyond musical and symbolic elements by privileging the spatial category. This focus reveals striking similarities across nations and their diasporas, and how identity, ideology and history merge in the articulation of self for the disenfranchised youth in a cross-cultural context. Ultimately, this article contributes to a broader project of mapping New World performance geographies, in this instance us- ing dancehall and kwaito as its main cases [s. abstract the world of music 50, 2008(2):35]. • Sydney Hutchinson: "Becoming the Tiguera : The Female Accordionist in Dominican Merengue Típico," 531-50. Abstract : Merengue típico is unique among Dominican musical genres (and nearly so in Latin America as a whole) for being the only one in which women have been more noticeable as instrumentalists than as singers. The classic male típico figure is the tiguere , the dandified but sexually aggressive "tiger" who hustles his way through life, gaining respect by successfully making his living on the margins of capitalism. As female accordionists try to make their way in the "man's world" of típico , they de- velop a feminine counterpart to this male role: they become assertive, sensual, yet strangely respected tigueras (a Dominicanism for "tigress") who look like women but play like men. The creation of this female role points to some ambiguities in the construction of Dominican masculinity and femininity, ambiguities that have become even more noticeable through the recent appearance of cross-dressing male merengueros. This paper is based on fieldwork conducted in New York and Santiago, Dominican Republic; it also draws upon the author's own experiences as a female accordionist performing meren- gue típico to explore the ways in which this music helps both to construct and to deconstruct traditional Dominican gender roles [s. abstract the world of music 50, 2008(3):37]. 9. Listening , Hearing , and Understanding • Jean During: "Hearing and Understanding in the Islamic Gnosis," 552-62. Abstract In the Islamic culture, reflections on hearing in general as well as on listening to music or to speech developed together with Sufism, mysticism and theology. However, this specific relationship is not only limited to the comprehension and interpretation of the listening process. On the one hand the myths and significant anecdotes are also open to other interpretations, such as those of a psycho- logical or phenomenological nature. On the other hand, the philosophy of perception - notably visual and auditory - , which is open to larger theosophical perspectives, is deeply anchored in experience. Mysticism and Sufism are not speculative paths but rather theological or metaphysical interpretations of those experiences that possess a particularly intensive and special quality. Within these interpre-</page><page sequence="9">2.

Vision particularly refers to the "imaginative" world and is hardly taken into account as part of the world of the senses, since in the Islamic gnosis there is no meditation on icons, mandalas or plastic forms. Contrary to this, hearing is the other fundamental axis to Revelation; it was privileged as a kind of contemplation, particularly in relation to the Sufi practice of samã a spiritual concert [s. abstract the world of music 39, 1 997(2): 1 27]. • Carl Gombrich: "Expressions of Inexpressible Truths: Attempts at Descriptions of Mystical and Musical Experiences," 563-79. Abstract This article has two themes. The themes are related in that they both point to similarities between aspects of mystical and musical experience. First, two approaches to mystical theology are recalled: the apophatic and the cataphatic; and analogies with music are made. Second, the article explores ways in which musical and mystical experience arising from both these approaches is de- scribed. In particular the use of contradiction and oxymoron is examined in the attempts to describe such experiences. Finally a short section on neurology offers some tentative suggestions as to how we might come to understand such experiences and the linguistic expression of them. The author offers his personal view that we should welcome such neurological researches and that the mystic vision will remain intact [s. abstract the world of music 50, 2008(1 ):89.]. • Ben Brinner: "Cognitive and Interpersonal Dimensions of Listening in Javanese Gamelan Performance," 580-95. Abstract : Taking the specific case of Central Javanese gamelan , this article considers how musicians listen in performance with emphasis on the highly context-dependent and socially situated nature of seemingly individual cognitive processes. Beginning with the conditions of performance and some of the more pervasive conventions evident in Javanese gamelan performance, the discussion turns to aural filtering and the differing experiences that musicians may have depending on the parts that they play, concluding with a demonstration of the integrated nature of interpersonal and cognitive aspects. The article draws on fieldwork conducted by the author in Central Java in 1982-83 and 1993 under the auspices of Fulbright fellowships as well as on other scholars' writing [s. abstract the world of music 41, 1999 ( 1 ): 1 9]. • Christian Utz: "Listening Attentatively to Cultural Fragmentation: Tradition and Composition in Works by East Asian Composers," 596-626. Abstract : Research on encounters between traditional non- Western music and contemporary composi- tional practice tends to neglect detailed musical analysis in favor of extensive socio-cultural or political theoretical frameworks. This article is an attempt to link these two diverse branches of musical scholar- ship. At first, two examples of cross-cultural musical appropriations point at the "bouncing" quality of musical interculturality: repercussions of a drinking song of the Taiwanese aborigines Ami and of the Chinese melody Molihua ("Jasmine Flower") suggest that "authenticity" in a strict sense has until the present often played a minor role in musical creation or daily musical practice. After reflecting on the impact of the concept of "composition" for both Western and non- Western music as a precondition of contemporary musical creation, examples are introduced of relevant works by East Asian composers in between implicit and explicit references to Asian musical material. The tension between nearness and distance to traditional and contemporary idioms and the challenge to find a balance between identifica- tion and criticism towards a cultural "Self' and a cultural "Other" are crucial aspects of compositional practice for some composers in Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan. Musical works by Koo Bonu, Kim Eun-Hye, Kim Jin-Hi, Guo Wenjing, Chen Xiaoyong, Hsu Po-Yun and Takahashi Yuji successfully re- flect on essentialized concepts of culture and thus arguably can represent substantial counter-discourses to the globally dominating system of Western music - a main criterion for the definition of a contem- porary East Asian "avant-garde."

Music , Politics , Ecology, and Democracy • Svanibor Pettan: "Gypsies, Music, and Politics in the Balkans: A Case Study from Kosovo," 628-57. Abstract : The author examines the adaptability of Gypsy musicians in one of the multiethnic, politi- cally tense regions in the Balkans. This adaptability is examined with regard to instrumentation, reper- toire, and manner of performance. All adaptive strategies point to the cosmopolitan position of Gypsy musicians. Their adaptability appears to be a creative process in which improvisatory treatment of ele- ments of various origins plays an important role. The results of the comparison of musical data match those of the comparison of extra-musical ones, thus suggesting that variation as the outcome might be a prominent feature not only of Gypsy musicianship in Kosovo, but also of the Kosovo Gypsy culture [s. abstract the world of music 38, 1996(1):33]. • Chan E.

All forms of contemporary music in the world have intercultural roots, and the traffic of influence can be metaphorically referred to as the flow of water from high to low position, from center to margin, and vice versa. Korea adopted as her main intercultural partner Western music, ranging from classical to gospel, folk, pop, ballad, jazz, rock, blues, and rap. P'ansori is a story-singing art that emerged from the repertoire of the outcast kwangdae singers during the mid- Choson era and evolved into Korea's Intangible Cultural Asset No. 5 in the twentieth century - it is an intriguing matrix of societal and aesthetic crossings, contradictions, engagements, disengagements, tale, and telling. Every cross-cultural act breaks new ground, forging a new connection, a new hybrid- ity, a new aesthetics, and it would be presumptuous to define cross-cultural aesthetics in fixed terms. My performance of the Tale of Hungbo, a cross-cultural p 'ansori narrating the travails and triumphs of the Korean-American journey, sums up the key issues linking hybridity and cross-cultural aesthetics [s. abstract the world of music 45, 2003(3):91]. • Nathan Hesselink: "Taking Culture Seriously: Democratic Music and Its Transformative Potential in South Korea," 670-701. Abstract : This article outlines my personal search for a working theory of democratic music in the context of South Korean folk drumming and dance {p 'ungmut). Motivated by the call of Korean po- litical theorists and folklorists of the late twentieth century for the identification and investigation of democratic elements within traditional culture, I attempt to locate such ideals in the musical structure and performance practices of an indigenous drumming tradition. Through an extensive review of the pertinent literature, I was able to identify five general principles of musical democracy that are consis- tent with established democratic theory. My analysis hopes to highlight the ways in which we can move beyond discussions of performative art in purely aesthetic terms, revealing the socially transformative potential of the artistic realm [s. abstract the world of music 49, 2007(3):75]. • Jeff Todd Titon: "Music and Sustainability: An Ecological Viewpoint," 702-20. Abstract : Attempts to preserve music as cultural heritage put applied ethnomusicologists and public folklorists in a defensive posture of safeguarding property assets. By supporting the conservation of those assets with tourist commerce, heritage management is doomed to the paradox of constructing staged authenticities with music treated as a market commodity. Instead, best practices arise from partnerships among ethnomusicologists, folklorists and music culture insiders (community leaders, scholars, and musicians), with sustainability interventions aimed directly inside music cultures. These efforts should be guided by principles drawn from ecology, not economy; and specifically by four principles from the new conservation ecology - diversity, limits to growth, interconnectedness, and stewardship [s. abstract the world of music 5 1 , 2009(1): 119.].</page><page sequence="11">2.

Ethnomusicology is at a new point in history, marked by the growing role of mediation, advocacy, and ethnomusicologists' experiences in familiar home environments. In studying a musical system/tradition that is in some sense the ethnomusicologist's own culture, ethnomusicologists have increasingly focused on the "applied work" that they do as teachers in the academy, which reflects the growing international interest in the critical and social role played by ethnomusicology in the academy. The articles in this collection complement this literature, while illustrating the development, disciplin- ing, and/or transmission of ethnomusicology in Australia, Brazil, Germany, Greece, South Africa, and the UK, and placing these diverse ethnomusicologies in their specific historical, political, social, and / or cultural contexts. In doing so, this collection brings to the fore principles, approaches, and concepts surrounding ethnomusicology as it is disciplined and transmitted in universities and conservatories in international settings. • Aaron Corn: "Sound Exchanges: An Ethnomusicologist's Approach to Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning in Collaboration with a Remote Indigenous Australian Community," 21-50. Abstract. Ethnomusicology is a highly pragmatic discipline in Australia driven by an ethos of research engagement that seeks to deliver applied and relevant outcomes for the musicians and communities whose lives and cultures ethnomusicologists examine. In this article, I explain how this ethos has been informed by the chequered history of colonial engagements with Australia's Indigenous peoples, and how this, in turn, has shaped my own approaches to teaching collaboratively with Indigenous col- leagues. I explore how, within this context, my own thinking as an ethnomusicologist was shaped by Indigenous conceptualizations of bi-culturalism such as those theorized by educator and musician Mandawuy Yunupigu, and how this influenced my collaborations with Indigenous colleagues in teach- ing the undergraduate course Garma Fieldwork at both the University of Melbourne and the University of Sydney. I show how this contribution as an ethnomusicologist was advantageous in challenging students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to think about the nature of knowledge, and the non- textual ways of expressing it that traditionally dominate within Indigenous epistemologies. Finally, I consider what insights this experience might hold for ethnomusicology amid this broad academic context. • Alvin Petersen: "Teaching African Musics: Personal Reflections in a South African University Setting," 51-64. voL 51, 2009 (3)</page><page sequence="12">30 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : This paper places under scrutiny the processes and key issues involved in presenting African musics as an academic discipline within a South African university setting. While I draw from others who have done seminal work in this regard, such as J.H. Kwabena Nketia, this case study constitutes a body of personal reflections gained during my own attempts of teaching African musics within the various South African universities where I was employed for over more than three decades. Specific focus will be placed on the University of the North - West (Potchefstroom) where I am currently based as Senior Lecturer in African Music. While some answers are proposed in regards to practical and theoretical issues, there remain many grey areas which demand further enquiry and fall beyond the purview of this paper. • Britta Sweers: "Toward a Framework for a Pedagogically-Informed Ethnomusicology: Perspectives from a German Musikhochschule ," 65-92. Abstract : Focusing on the performance-oriented Musikhochschulen ("Universities of Music;" lit. con- servatories) as a central location of academic ethnomusicological teaching in Germany, this article analyzes possible intersections between ethnomusicology and school music pedagogy. As is argued here, the specific educational environment of the Musikhochschule provides a stimulating basis for the development of a "pedagogically informed ethnomusicology," which is based on a conscious context- oriented adaptation of the multi-layered concepts, theories, and approaches in ethnomusicology. The development of this educational concept, which could also contribute to a stronger long-term imple- mentation of the discipline, is illustrated by a focus on the transmission of (1) knowledge of different cultures, (2) theory and concepts in ethnomusicology, (3) performance skills, and (4) ethnographic fieldwork. • Samuel Araujo and José Alberto Salgado e Silva: "Musical Knowledge, Transmission, and Worldviews: Ethnomusicological Perspectives from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil," 93-1 10. Abstract : Formulating concepts and practices from an ethnomusicological viewpoint in Brazilian higher education institutions is a teaching/research experience marked by two distinct forces: first, a growing interest among certain students and scholars for music that is "traditional," "popular," and "in- formally transmitted;" and second, an enduring tension that is caused by the transmission of ethnomu- sicology in institutions where music has been taught mainly in the modus operandi of a conservatory. This essay suggests that there is room and demand for ethnomusicological work across universities, schools, and NGOs, as it offers a means for investigating the variety of local musical repertoires and practices in Brazil today. • Eleni Kallimopoulou: "Ethnomusicology and its Greek Meanings: Practices, Discourses, and Pedagogies in the University," 111-37. Abstract : This article reports on Greek ethnomusicological discourses and practices and their institu- tional articulation in Greek tertiary education. I examine how ethnomusicology constitutes a field for the confrontation and interaction between competing local disciplinary paradigms and ideologies of identity and knowledge. Further, attention to two music departments reveals a consistent tendency to construct an "ethnomusicology of Greek music" by connecting ethnomusicology with Greek music. • Simone Krüger: "The Ethnomusicologist as Pedagogue: Disciplining Ethnomusicology in the United Kingdom," 139-70. Abstract This article is about the history, disciplining, and transmission of ethnomusicology at uni- versities in the United Kingdom. The opening sections will illustrate the contexts and broader organi- zational structure of higher education in the UK, and sketch the ideological and social practices that inform the disciplining of ethnomusicology and its transmission to students at universities. The sub- sequent discussions will position ethnomusicology as an interdisciplinary field of enquiry, organized around three principal disciplinary alliances that characterize the disciplining of ethnomusicology at universities in the UK, namely musicology; anthropology; and interdisciplinary studies of popular music. The final discussions will provide a reflexive account of "knowing by doing and experiencing" while deriving a model for ethnomusicology pedagogy that represents the interdisciplinary, experien- tial, and holistic transmission of ethnomusicology in the UK today.</page><page sequence="13">2.

Savage: "Being, Transcendence, and Ontology of Music," 7-22. Abstract : John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music's relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual ef- ficacy. • Meilu Ho: "A True Self Revealed: Song and Play in Pushti Marg Liturgical Service," 23^13: Abstract : Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that perform- ing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya. • Helena Simonett: "Narrativity and Selfhood in Mayo-Yoreme Mortuary Rituals," 45-64. Abstract Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of being-enjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well. Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other indi- viduals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood - of both the individual and the community - may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso. • Deborah Kapchan: "Learning to Listen: The Sound of Sufism in France," 65-89. Abstract : How does sound encode sacred affect? And how is sacred sound, and thus sacred emotion, learned? While much has been written on spiritual belief from the point of view of narrative (Harding 2003; Woolard and Schieffelin 1994) and the body (Csordas 1994), less attention has been paid to the power of "sound" and, more importantly, listening, to shape sacred identities and create community. This article attends to the aural dimensions of sacred ritual performance focusing on the role of music, chanting as well as listening and utterance in the performance of a Sufi wadhifa , or liturgy, including the ceremony of remembrance, or dhikr. Moving respectively through the social context, the ritual form and analytical frames, I end by explicating what I refer to as a "literacy of listening" (Kapchan 2008) - that is, the acquired ability to learn other cultures (specifically religious cultures, though not exclusively these) through participating in its sound economy. • Rebecca D. Sager: "My Song is My Bond: Haitian Vodou Singing and the Transformation of Being," 91-118. Abstract Within Haitian vodou tradition, transcendent experience through singing, drumming, danc- ing, and ritual is highly valued as a nexus of human contact with the supernatural realm and spiritual power that directly affects daily living. Beyond being simply a nexus of contact, this article explores how singing serves to bond human and spirit, and enacts a covenant between spirit, human, and divine. This exploration is ethnographically grounded upon conversations with a manbo - a ritual specialist and family leader - about her spirit-derived moral philosophy of respè (respect) as well as recordings of an intimate kraze tab (breaking down the table) ritual. In one recording, a vodou spirit "mounted within" the manbo, officiates the ritual; in the second, the manbo listens back upon the recording of herself as the spirit while interpreting the meaning of the spirit's actions, songs, and speech. Working</page><page sequence="15">2. Contents and Abstracts • 33 towards a phenomenology of transcendent experience that privileges the philosophy of vodou practi- tioners in northern Haiti, I examine (1) the identifying characteristics of singing and speaking of the manbo as herself versus as the spirit; (2) the expressive and philosophical artifacts resulting from the interpersonal and "intra" personal interactions between spirits and devotees; as well as (3) the motiva- tions and potential benefits of achieving transcendence, both for individual and society. The nature of being, whether being human or being spirit, comes into greater focus through this manbo'' s insights on singing and the transformation of being. • Jean Kidula: "Transcending Time, Empowering Space: (Re)iterating a Logooli/Luyia/Kenyan Song," 119-39. Abstract Song styles, repertoire and performance practices are integral in the affirmation, alteration and transformation of being and belonging among the Logooli. A standard Logooli song Mwanamberi , technically describing childbirth, is performed at all major rites of passage and significant events. Be- ginning with this song, I argue that among the Logooli, different ceremonial rites are dominated by particular song types, styles and performance practices that demonstrate enduring indigenous beliefs as well as transformations due to contact with other religious and contemporary practices. These mu- sics embody and reiterate the place and role of an individual in the natural and supernatural. They also demonstrate Logooli perception of selfhood at local spiritual and historical as well as in the global, religious, and contemporary arena. Book Reviews (Helena Simonett, ed.) • N.

Abstract If music is regarded as a renewable biocultural resource, then the current discourse surround- ing sustainability contributes ways of thinking about music and cultural policy. Coming principally from developmental economists and conservation ecologists, sustainability provides a theoretical and practical framework for applied ethnomusicology. Cultural and musical rights and ownership, the cir- culation and conservation of music, the internal vitality of music cultures and the social organization of their music-making, music education and transmission, the roles of community scholars and practi- tioners, intangible cultural heritage, tourism, and the creative economy, preservation versus revitaliza- tion, partnerships among culture workers and community leaders, and good stewardship of musical resources, are among the issues to which the essayists in this volume address sustainability thinking. • Mark F.

Contents and Abstracts • 35 and dance scene that developed without government support or any kind of centralized direction - and the role that social capital has played in this context. Social capital is understood to consist of social networks plus the resources to be mobilized, be they economic, political, intellectual, or cultural. The necessity of trust to social capital is explored through ethnographic analysis, as are the contributions of bonding (strong ties) versus bridging (weak ties). In addition to "getting ahead," it is found that weak ties can also be used for "getting by," where mutual recognition of legitimacy amounts to the right to pay one's money at the door and "pass a good time" regardless of ethnic or racial identity. Civil society - social organization that owes its existence to neither the market nor the state - is most often associated with relationships between people and their government, providing either political advocacy or social services. It is proposed here that social capital in the dance scene fuels public cul- tural expression, an aspect of civil society often overlooked and a public good in its own right. Viewed thus, hosting a dance with live music becomes a civic activity supporting folk art forms that the United States federal government funds in modest ways and the California state government almost not at all. From the author's fieldwork experiences, suggestions are offered for how cultural advocates can work to make or keep music sustainable using strategies designed to foster social capital. Finally, social capital is offered as a useful analytical framework for ethnomusicologists, who (for the most part) have yet to take it up. • Tom Faux: "Don Roy, Fiddle Music, and Social Sustenance in Franco New England," 35-54. Abstract : Don Roy is a fiddle player of Franco- American extraction who lives, and works in southern Maine. Don learned to fiddle from older family members, and was a champion in fiddling contests throughout New England and Québec. During the 1990s he became professionally involved in the non- profit heritage industry, as a performer and a carrier of Maine French cultural tradition. During the late twentieth century, Franco- American ethnicity was being officially supported by state and non-profit in- stitutions as an important, formerly marginalized feature of Maine's cultural landscape. However, that era also witnessed the closing of the largely French-operated textile mills that had sustained French cul- ture in northern New England, and the concomitant decline of French language and religious practices in the region. The article traces Don's role as official tradition-bearer, and his subsequent cultivation of a sustainable music community in his southern Maine locality. • Lois Wilcken: '"Pay for Play': The Redistribution of Payola for Music Diversity in New York State and Its Implications for Sustainability in Music," 55-74. Abstract : This essay seeks to connect the dots between payola, media consolidation, music diversity, and sustainability in music. It begins with a brief history of payola, the practice of paying a radio station to play a specific music recording without disclosure to the public; suggests a reciprocal rela- tionship between the "new payola" and corporate media consolidation at the turn of this century; and evaluates claims and counterclaims that media consolidation is detrimental to or supportive of music diversity. The article details New York State's payola investigations of 2005-2006, which reached cash settlements with major players for redistribution to music organizations disadvantaged by payola. Finally, "Pay for Play" reflects on the efficacy of this unique approach to fostering diversity in the marketplace. Effective or not, efforts on the part of a state government to redistribute corporate profits on behalf of underrepresented music point to a concern for cultural diversity not unlike concerns for genetic and species diversity in the biological sphere. • Janet Topp Fargion: "'For My Own Research Purposes'?: Examining Ethnomusicology Field Methods for a Sustainable Music," 75-93. Abstract : Although we might describe the beginnings of ethnomusicology as springing from the work of early travel writers, missionaries and the like, it is generally accepted that the study of the world's music became a serious enterprise with the invention of sound recording technology. Though ethno- musicology has diversified far beyond straight analysis of recordings, recording has been central to the discipline, arguably providing its defining methodology, from the outset, more than one hundred years ago. The discipline's relationship with recordings has changed over time, however, as method-</page><page sequence="18">36 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) ology has shifted from armchair analysis to participant observation, and the research endeavour has moved from comparative musicology to the study of music in context. Ethnomusicology's relationship with archives has changed in parallel where deposit and use of archival materials was more the norm before the 1 950s than it is today. This paper presents thoughts from my own research with practicing ethnomusicologists exploring their relationship with their own recordings and perceptions of ethno- musicology based on existing archival recordings. It argues for a more responsible, applied discipline and investigates best practice for making recordings that can be more easily disseminated, present- ing a number of case studies and the work of the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Creative Heritage Project. • Thomas Turino: "Four Fields of Music Making and Sustainable Living," 95-1 17. Abstract : This paper introduces and summarizes a framework for thinking about music making in rela- tion to four distinct social fields: participatory performance, presentational performance, high fidelity recording, and studio audio art recording. Each field has specific benefits and constraints and fulfills different social functions. The distinct fields variably suit different types of individuals as well as dif- ferent types of social formations. The author argues that presentational performance and high fidel- ity recording fit best with the profit goals and competitive values of capitalist societies. As relatively cooperative, egalitarian spaces that are about sociality, bonding, and fun, rather than about hierarchy, competition, financial achievement, or the creation of art objects, participatory performance provides a powerful experiential model of alternative values and ways of being for people in capitalist societies. Repeated involvement with participatory performance creates a special social space for habit change necessary for developing alternative, sustainable ways of living. • Jeff Todd Titon: "Music and Sustainability: An Ecological Viewpoint," 119-37. Abstract : Attempts to preserve music as cultural heritage put applied ethnomusicologists and public folklorists in a defensive posture of safeguarding property assets. By supporting the conservation of those assets with tourist commerce, heritage management is doomed to the paradox of constructing staged authenticities with music treated as a market commodity. Instead, best practices arise from partnerships among ethnomusicologists, folklorists and music culture insiders (community leaders, scholars, and musicians), with sustainability interventions aimed directly inside music cultures. These efforts should be guided by principles drawn from ecology, not economy; and specifically by four principles from the new conservation ecology - diversity, limits to growth, interconnectedness, and stewardship.

Abstract : The term "the accordion" is used to refer to a variety of free-reed instruments with differ- ent physical and musical characteristics, relating to the geographical and cultural traits of the different peoples that play them. The accordion is also seen as a "universal" instrument imbued with unique and recognizable characteristics. This overview traces the emergence and development of the idea of the accordion, demonstrating that its rise has depended largely on the popularization of the piano ac- cordion in the twentieth century and the specific development of larger economic, social, and political patterns - the process of globalization. It is this historical process that has provided the conditions and motivating factors for the accordion to emerge, disappear, and re-surface in new contexts. • Graeme Smith: "Irish Button Accordion: From Press and Draw and Back Again," 15-36. Abstract. Irish traditional dance music players have used diatonic button accordions to play traditional dance music since the start of the twentieth century, and have developed styles with distinct social con- notations. Early players used single-row melodeons, and later, two-row instruments, in ways strongly influenced by single-row playing. A new two-row style popularized by Paddy O'Brien in the 1950s in- troduced musical innovations which were enthusiastically embraced by players, but criticized by com- mentators. In the 1970s, a stylistic reversal which developed an elaborated version of pre-war playing became popular as an explicit revision of the 1950s post-war style and its social meanings. Leading players such as Jackie Daly and Sharon Shannon have shifted the accordion away from the cultural- nationalist connotations in which it was embedded. • Sydney Hutchinson: "Becoming the Tiguera : The Female Accordionist in Dominican Merengue Típico ," 37-56. vol 50,2008 (3)</page><page sequence="20">38 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : Merengue típico is unique among Dominican musical genres (and nearly so in Latin America as a whole) for being the only one in which women have been more noticeable as instrumentalists than as singers. The classic male típico figure is the tiguere , the dandified but sexually aggressive "tiger" who hustles his way through life, gaining respect by successfully making his living on the margins of capitalism. As female accordionists try to make their way in the "man's world" of típico , they de- velop a feminine counterpart to this male role: they become assertive, sensual, yet strangely respected tigueras (a Dominicanism for "tigress") who look like women but play like men. The creation of this female role points to some ambiguities in the construction of Dominican masculinity and femininity, ambiguities that have become even more noticeable through the recent appearance of cross-dressing male merengueros . This paper is based on fieldwork conducted in New York and Santiago, Dominican Republic; it also draws upon the author's own experiences as a female accordionist performing meren- gue típico to explore the ways in which this music helps both to construct and to deconstruct traditional Dominican gender roles. • Marion S. Jacobson: "Valtaro Musette: Italians, Accordions, and a Pluralistic Vision of Ethnicity in New York City," 57-79. Abstract This article investigates the relationships between the politics of music, commerce and plu- rality with regard to Valtaro musette, a Northern Italian accordion repertoire and playing style that was popularized through the Italian cabaret culture of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s in New York City. Focusing on the efforts of two musically influential piano accordionists and nightclub owners John Brugnoli (d. 2002) and Pete Spagnoli (b. 1921), this paper identifies the repertoire, musical style, and characteristics of these songs and decades of ongoing dance-hall events that accounted for this mu- sic's commercial appeal and popularity with Northern Italian American immigrants. An overview of the differing symbolic possibilities of the accordion in urban Italian American culture at mid-century demonstrates that meaning assigned to musical instruments is often contradictory, always in flux, and subject to the positioning of interpreters. Contrary to some previous interpretations, this article sug- gests that the accordion provided an alternative to opera fan culture and a space for the articulation and affirmation of Italian ethnic experience through "continental" (European) music, as a response to the general sense of social and cultural isolation. I argue that the accordion and the Valtaro repertoire allowed change through a filtering process in which Northern Italian music and dance was legitimized by positioning itself as cosmopolitan, "continental," and European (in opposition to Southern Italian, rural, and poor). Through the creators of Valtaro musette and a second generation of players active today in New York, the accordion assumed implicit and explicit class and ethnic dimensions unique to the Northern Italian American context. • Yin Yee Kwan: "The Transformation of the Accordion in Twentieth-century China," 81-99. Abstract : China has a long history of importing foreign musical cultures. Western music, including its instruments and performance practice, became popular following its introduction in the late nineteenth century, and Chinese people have fervently committed themselves to mastering it. European musical instruments, especially the piano and the violin, had been well received in Chinese society; however, the accordion's reception and history in China differed drastically from other imported European in- struments. This paper describes the cultural role of the accordion in modern Chinese culture and soci- ety. Focusing on the piano accordion, it explores the instrument's functions and roles in the song and dance troupes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and how military accordionists established an "accordion culture" that enhanced mass movements in China from the 1950s through the 1970s. It also discusses accordion manufacture during the Mao era and considers the instrument's present role as an icon of nostalgia in the post-Mao era. I argue that the accordion's association with the working class may explain why Chinese musicians and historians downplay the significance of the instrument and ignore its role in the history of Chinese music. • Maria Sonevytsky: "The Accordion and Ethnic Whiteness: Toward a New Critical Organology," 101-18.</page><page sequence="21">2. Contents and Abstracts • 39 Abstract : Musical instruments, the musician's extra-corporeal "voice" that produces sound in time, mediate the act of sound-making between the musician and the music and therefore constitute a unique category of "things" to subject to the question: how does an inanimate object express its "social life"? Through their morphological, metaphorical, and historical contexts, musical instruments index a va- riety of socially prescribed attributes. This paper tells the story of the accordion's entanglement with "ethnic whiteness," a stereotype closely aligned with the well-publicized biography of Lawrence Welk. The paper advocates for a new critical organological approach that seriously considers the musical in- strument as an actor in the making of musical meaning. This approach is applied to two contemporary New York City-based accordionists who respond to the stereotype of "ethnic whiteness" through their musical performances and compositions, Guy Klucevsek and Rachelle Garniez.

Abstract : Kwaito is a form of electronic dance music that emerged alongside the democratization of South Africa between Mandela's release from prison in 1990 and the country's first democratic elec- tion in 1994. Kwaito is commonly understood as an expression of celebratory freedom after decades of vol. 50, 2008 (2)</page><page sequence="22">40 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) living under the oppressive apartheid regime, and as the voice of the black youth in the post-apartheid era. Set to a track consisting of looped synthesized drums, bass, and electronic samples, kwaito vocals usually consist of a few repeated phrases in isiZulu, English, or an urban vernacular that linguist Sizwe Satyo (2001) calls "ArawYo-speak." Kwaito is often accompanied by dancing and the consumption of alcohol or zol (marijuana), and is heard at all night street "bashes," at concerts, and in shebeens (pubs). This preface focuses on four main topics: kwaito' s history, kwaito's politics, the musical characteristics of kwaito , and the etymology of the word kwaito. • Sharlene Swartz: "Is Kwaito South African Hip-hop? Why the Answer Matters and Who It Matters To," 15-33. Abstract : This paper asks whether South Africa's kwaito is an indigenous form of hip-hop or an origi- nal "spectacular vernacular" and considers how the difference between kwaito and hip-hop is discur- sively constructed and performed. The provenance, politics, economics and style of kwaito provides the locations for this comparison with hip-hop. While its provenance is similar to that of hip-hop, understanding the complex politics of kwaito deepens our understanding of identity and resistance in the context of the South African racial taxonomy and political history. The economics of kwaito alerts us to both the materialism of kwaito culture and the power of economics as political act. Finally by interpreting the style or "reading" some of the cultural artifacts associated with kwaito , the ambivalent relationship between young "black" South Africans and the various dominant groups against which they rail is highlighted. • Sonjah Stanley Niaah: "A Common Space: Dancehall, Kwaito , and the Mapping of New World Music and Performance," 35-50. Abstract At the interstices of cultural geography and performance studies, this article continues the au- thor's earlier research and writing on Jamaica's dancehall culture, and analyzes the applicability of in- sights gained to other black performance genres, most notably South African kwaito. Through research methods including interviews and participant observation, a comparative perspective on dancehall and kwaito reveals unexplored parallels, particularly ideological and spatial ones. I therefore expand the focus beyond musical and symbolic elements by privileging the spatial category. This focus reveals striking similarities across nations and their diasporas, and how identity, ideology and history merge in the articulation of self for the disenfranchised youth in a cross-cultural context. Ultimately, this article contributes to a broader project of mapping New World performance geographies, in this instance us- ing dancehall and kwaito as its main cases. • Martina Viljoen: "On the Margins of Kwaito ," 5 1-73. Abstract : This article explores kwaito 's early years by focusing on South African music legend Brenda Fassie. While Fassie is not usually known as a kwaito artist, her "bubblegum" music of the 1980s was hugely influential on later kwaito musicians, and in the early 1990s Fassie recorded several tracks that arguably fall under the category of kwaito. An analysis of Fassie's life and music does not represent a clear break with earlier South African music. I attempt a more nuanced historicization of kwaito in this article, and seek to uncover continuities as well as ruptures in the post-apartheid period. • Tanja Bosch: " Kwaito on Community Radio: The Case of Bush Radio in Cape Town, South Africa," 75-89. Abstract : Through qualitative interviews in Cape Town with Bush Radio staff and participant observa- tion conducted at the station between 2002 and 2004, this article explores Bush Radio's use of kwaito music, and how it contributes towards a rhizomatic development of community. Located within a cul- tural studies framework, this article approaches kwaito as cultural text capable of generating multiple meanings. In particular, it argues that those who work at Bush Radio strategically use kwaito music to create and sustain a divided community in search of a new black identity. Furthermore, the article also addresses how kwaito is specifically constructed and contested on the airwaves of Bush Radio and by station staff. • Sizwe Satyo: "A Linguistic Study of Kwaito ," 91-102.</page><page sequence="23">2.

The connections between kwaito- speak and kwaito music are multiple. Kwaito-speak and kwaito music share similar structures and large-scale aesthetics. Or, to put it differently, both kwaito- speak and kwaito music fall under the larger category of what we can simply call " kwaito ." More obviously, but no less important, kwaito- speak is the language variety spoken by kwaito fans in South Africa. An analysis of kwaito- speak is important in understand- ing the kwaito subculture. • Gavin Steingo: "Producing Kwaito: Nkosi Sikelel' i Afrika After Apartheid. In memory of Lebo Mathosa (1977-2006)," 103-20. Abstract : This article examines kwaito group Boom Shaka's reworking of Enoch Sontonga's classic hymn, Nkosi Sikelel' i Afrika. Drawing on the work of Stephen Miles and Gary Tomlinson, I reject a hermeneutic approach to music analysis and instead analyze the creative and material processes in- volved in the production of Boom Shaka's song. The use of House tracks in the production of kwaito not only structures the harmonic and rhythmic framework of the latter, but implies a larger network of material and informational flows that make such use possible in the first place. I argue that Boom Shaka's version of Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika illustrates and assumes an openness to the past, the future, and the world outside South Africa. As such, the song exemplifies the post-apartheid "condition" and requires rigorous analysis. Book Reviews (Helena Simonett, ed.) • Bruno Netti: "Laurent Aubert.

Abstract : This paper examines, through an interdisciplinary study, the connections between language and music at an organizational level. Interactions between language and music are reflected in our perception and cognitive representations of sound structures. The author shows that there are correla- tions between linguistic and musical organization, and that specific configurations of rhythmic and melodic structures influence our perception of musical works. Excerpts taken from operatic music, and belonging to the French and English repertoire, have been selected to illustrate some of those configura- tions. It is suggested, amongst other things, that the dynamic construction operating between linguistic and musical units directly affects our perception of vocal music, while echoing fundamental structures of language and music. • Sofia Barreto and Eva Ordóñez Flores: "Dance and Music in Canarian Malagueñas ," 17-31. Abstract : The malagueñas of the Canary Islands are a variation of Spanish fandangos del sur. Malague- ñas represent a repertoire of songs danced in a particular Canarian style, which breaks away freely from its original Andalusian malagueña source. The aim of this article is to deal with the correlation between music, text and dance in malagueñas , which are mainly based on the parallelism of their structural arrangement. Thus, some of the choreographic figures are almost systematically associated with specific passages of songs, notably during introductions and interludes between stanzas. Styles of Canarian malagueñas vary according to the performance or the free dance context in which they are presented. When a malagueña is danced during a professional performance, the correlations between music, text and dance become more obvious than those which are observed during a non-professional interpretation, in a ball situation, for instance. Choreographic changes are so frequent that they happen in each musical phrase. Symmetry and stereotypical patterns, together with an exact coordination be- tween dancers and choreographic virtuosity, are very much appreciated by the audience. • Eva Ordóñez Flores: "Dance Improvisation Rules and Practice in the Cuadro Flamenco ,"33-47. Abstract. The aim of this article is to study flamenco dance components. The traditional form in which the dance appears is called the cuadro flamenco. This is minimally constituted of a dancer, a guitar- ist and a singer. The feeling of spontaneity given off by the performance is dependent on very strict codes and rules. Those rules are inherent in the dance, to such a point that, even if the choreography is pre-established or appears in a ballet form, those elements continue to be present. Each piece of the flamenco repertoire has a structural organisation, more or less flexible according to the piece which is performed, but which is prescriptive enough to be respected.

This frame, which a priori seems to be rigid, marks out the performer's choreographic interpretation.

The freedom of expression, which at first seems relatively narrow, can be expanded thanks to the mastery of technique, rules and means. • Eva Ordóñez Flores and Marc Jeannin: "Metrical and Rhythmic Interpretations in Cante Flamenco 49-62. Abstract : This article presents a study of the metrical and rhythmic interpretations in cante flamenco. Although interpretations of the copla flamenca seem chaotic, it is shown that particular metrical and rhythmical structures precisely underlie its organization. By analyzing the means used by performers, it is possible to determine the structures on which cante flamenco is based. The organization of metri- cal patterns in flamenco music suggests primary configurations between linguistic and musical accen- tuation. In this article, the authors attempt to demonstrate that specific fundamental structures govern the hierarchical system resulting from the association of linguistic and musical elements. Correlations between typical forms of coplas are made by analyzing metrical patterns from both a linguistic and a musical perspective. Furthermore, improvisation in flamenco music, which is a major characteristic of this musical style, appears to be confined to relative freedom only, since the framework in which it evolves is partly defined by deep organizational structures. Finally, it is suggested that the interpreta- tions of the cante flamenco echo fundamental patterns of Spanish poetry. • Sofia Barreto: Venezuelan Carnival Songs: Singing Calipso in El Callao," 63-71. Abstract. El Callao is a mining town located in Venezuelan Guyana, which was developed in the middle of the nineteenth century by an influx of immigrants from the Caribbean islands. Those im- migrants were attracted by a buried richness: gold. They brought their own richness: their traditions, particularly Carnival songs. The songs and dances of the El Callao Carnival are a beautiful example of the combination of many different cultural influences, concerning, among other things, musical struc- tures, rhythms, vocal styles and instrumentation. The use of different languages in those songs is one of the multiple aspects of this cultural mixture. In spite of the fact that most of those immigrants came from non-Hispanic islands, Spanish was the official and common language in El Callao, as well as in the rest of Venezuela. The only place where we still find English, as well as English and French creole, is in the texts of Carnival songs. Even when those texts are sung in Spanish, we can hear changes in the pronunciation of certain sounds like the "r" or the "o", modified in order to be close to the English or French pronunciation. These linguistic modifications and certain musical characteristics are used in order to have "a right calipso voice", such as well marked accents and good articulation, sometimes by separating every syllable of the words. The ideal mode of singing is not always easy to attain, es- pecially with people singing in a language they do not know very well. The result of that is a curious mixture of styles and pronunciations which reflects both Venezuelan and Caribbean influences, form- ing an individual new style: that of the Venezuelan calipso. • Apollinaire Anakesa and Marc Jeannin: "Rhythmic and Melodic Variations in Traditional African Music and Dance: Mongo's Bobongo Culture," 73-88. Abstract : Music is a vital expression in African people's lives, often characterizing their specific cul- tural background. Many rituals and dances are performed according to the rhythms and melodies of traditional music. In the North of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a group of Bantu peoples called Mongo, whose culture offers a rich artistic diversity, live in an area surrounded by the immense Congo River and protected by the dense equatorial forest. Amongst this ethnic group, the Ekonda people prac- tice a traditional rite named Bobongo. This ritual ceremony is particularly remarkable as it combines song with dance in the form of a spectacular show which is authentic to their culture. Dancers and sing- ers are specially trained to perform this rite, and chants and dances are accompanied by a series of ac- robatics carried out with discipline and control. The result of this mixture of artistic expression through sounds, words, rhythms, melodies and bodily gestures, cannot leave one indifferent, for it is highly emotional.

Its style incites introspection. Coupling chants with dances, it preaches a model of equilibrium. Singing, accompanied by percussion instru- ments, zithers, cries or hand clapping, is apparently developed in total freedom. Appearing simple at first, the performance becomes increasingly complex and words, music and dance fuse together. The authors examine the ritual musical and choreographic parameters of Bobongo according to an organi- zational model deriving from its performance and culture. This article attempts to define the fundamen- tal characteristics - the articulation of structures and systems - of African music and dance through reference to Mongo's Bobongo culture. It deals with the form and context of the artistic realization of these characteristics and looks at the factors that contribute to their intermingling. • Carl Gombrich: "Expressions of Inexpressible Truths: Attempts at Descriptions of Mystical and Musical Experiences," 89-105. Abstract. This article has two themes. The themes are related in that they both point to similarities between aspects of mystical and musical experience. First, two approaches to mystical theology are recalled: the apophatic and the cataphatic; and analogies with music are made. Second, the article explores ways in which musical and mystical experience arising from both these approaches is de- scribed. In particular the use of contradiction and oxymoron is examined in the attempts to describe such experiences. Finally a short section on neurology offers some tentative suggestions as to how we might come to understand such experiences and the linguistic expression of them. The author offers his personal view that we should welcome such neurological researches and that the mystic vision will remain intact. Book Reviews (Helena Simonett, ed.) • Barry Shank: "Fabian Holt.

The collection of essays in this volume moves forward from the position that music and poli- tics are always inextricably linked. The modern conceit of autonomous art fails to account for the his- torical and cultural embeddedness of music, that its creation and performance exist within overlapping spheres of economics, social status, political control, religious practice, and public reception. Music is also realized within specific spaces - each with their own semantically laden histories and uses - and that performances always have an audience, the act of listening itself contingent on appropriation, control, and the construction of meaning. Music as embodied, performative art is an essentially social entity, snared within webs of relationships between patrons, rulers, composers, performers, audiences, and technology. That the musical worlds of the East and West could be conceptualized as separate (but increasingly interacting) universes during much of the twentieth century belies their remarkably simi- lar foundations. For both ancient Greek theorists and early Confucian scholar-officials, music was the arena in which the proper balance between mankind, the state, and the broader world was checked and regulated. A concern with numbers, ratios, cosmology, and ideas related to beauty were as much pas- sions of the Pythagoreans as they were early Chinese ritual specialists. And while music and politics were comfortable bedfellows in both of these societies more than two millennia ago, in East Asia - here focusing on the Korean peninsula - such a heightened sensitivity to music's social and spiritual properties and energies maintained an explanatory power much longer than it did in the West, at least on the official governmental level. What this collection of essays will illustrate in dramatic manner is the seriousness with which music was and continues to be taken within political contexts that is frankly quite surprising to those unfamiliar with the Korean experience. • Robert C. Provine: "Music, Measurements, Pitch Survivals, and Bell Shapes in Korea," 13-30. Abstract : The young Chosõn dynasty court, in keeping with long-standing Chinese Confucian tradi- tion, needed to establish in the early fifteenth century a new set of standardized measurements (length, weight, and volume) for use in the kingdom. The measurements were all proportionately related, so that if one were fixed, all the others were also thereby determined. Following Chinese precedent, the Koreans did considerable research into the establishing of a fundamental musical pitch from which the other twelve pitches in the musical system could be determined, and the length of the pitch pipe which produced this fundamental pitch in turn constituted a basic unit of length from which the other standard measurements could be calculated. • Nam Sang-sook: "The Debate over the Distortion of Chongmyo Cheryeak ," 31-52.

Abstract : Researchers in Korean studies looking into the popular entertainment industries during the colonial period have historically focused on cultural nationalism or economic prowess. Studies of mu- sic from this period that are not primarily concerned with aspects of resistance or censorship have come out only in the last few years, and so it is only recently that the popularity of the many new forms of entertainment among Koreans at the time has come to be recognized. In this article I describe the inter- action of Koreans and Japanese in these industries from the time of their inception around the turn of the nineteenth century, and relate how politics on the one hand, and the influence of technology on the other, changed both the sound and concept of recorded Korean music until the late 1930s. In doing so, I focus on recordings of traditional music and refute the idea that the Japanese tried to indiscriminately manipulate them from the outset. • Nathan Hesselink: "Taking Culture Seriously: Democratic Music and Its Transformative Potential in South Korea," 75-106. Abstract : This article outlines my personal search for a working theory of democratic music in the context of South Korean folk drumming and dance (p 'ungmul). Motivated by the call of Korean po- litical theorists and folklorists of the late twentieth century for the identification and investigation of democratic elements within traditional culture, I attempt to locate such ideals in the musical structure and performance practices of an indigenous drumming tradition. Through an extensive review of the pertinent literature, I was able to identify five general principles of musical democracy that are consis- tent with established democratic theory. My analysis hopes to highlight the ways in which we can move beyond discussions of performative art in purely aesthetic terms, revealing the socially transformative potential of the artistic realm. • Kwon Ohsung: "The Re-formation of Traditional Folksongs in North Korea," Abstract. In this paper I address the understanding and use of folksongs in North Korea. Considerable governmental efforts and resources have been dedicated to discovering, preserving, and developing this musical legacy. At the heart of such activity lies the re-creation and/or re-formation of texts, musi- cal form, key, and rhythmic structure. I argue that such modifications have had a largely positive effect, and that such work can serve as a model for research being carried out in South Korea today.

Abstract : Five articles were first presented as papers at the meeting of the ICTM Music Archaeology Study Group (MASTG) at the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, UCLA, in April 2003 and revised and expanded for this issue. The conference was organized by Julia Sanchez, then chair of the study group. Two articles by researchers working on the prehispanic music cultures of Oaxaca were added for this topical issue. Each contributor brings a novel perspective, based on training, area of research, and experience, cre- ating illuminating discussion between ethnomusicologists, anthropological archaeologists, and musi- cians. Musical practices of the Classic Maya civilization (AD 250-900) are discussed in two papers. Matthias Stöckli, writing on the sound artifacts of Aguateca, a site of the lowland Maya region, Guate- mala, takes archaeological and organological information into account, while Julia Sanchez discusses Maya processions on the basis of the iconography of preserved murals and vase depictions. Susan Rawcliffe's paper is dedicated to the organology and acoustics of West Mexican flutes, dating from the Middle and Late Preclassic periods (1000 BC-AD 200). Examining recent finds made by archaeolo- gists at different sites, Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago resumes the rich organological history of Oaxaca from the Preclassic times onwards. In another paper, Agustín Pimentel Díaz discusses the music ico- nography of the Codex Nuttall, a Mixtee picture manuscript dating from the fourteenth century.

Olsen: "The Complementarity and Interdisciplinarity of Archaeomusicology: An Introduction to the Field and this Volume," 1 1-15. Abstract : Archaeomusicology, the study of music through archaeology, is a discipline which combines archaeology and musicology. It is the science(-ology) of music and music-related aspects of archaeo- logical cultures. In other words, it is the study of music, musical instruments, and music making from archaeological sources. This introduction to the present volume explains how the discipline of archaeo- musicology is based on the coming together of many approaches by scholars with diverse backgrounds and research strategies. In spite of this diversity, all the scholars who have contributed to this issue have at least one goal in common: to understand music and musical expressions of ancient civilizations. • Matthias Stöckli: "Playing Music as a Domestic Activity? Interpretations of the Finds of Sound-producing Artifacts at Aguateca, El Petén, Guatemala," 17-33. Abstract Recent excavations at Aguateca, a Maya Classic site in lowland Guatemala, not only un- earthed a variety of sound-producing instruments but also revealed, thanks to the specific mode certain areas of the site were abandoned by their inhabitants, the distribution patterns of those artifacts. This in turn allowed drawing and substantiating conclusions about their original users and the contexts they were used in, particularly with regard to elite women's music practices as part of their general household activities. Thus, the exceptional archaeological situation discovered at Aguateca broadens considerably our understanding of the uses and functions of this kind of artifacts which at most Mayan sites were found in circumstances rendering an analysis and interpretation which aim at more than the organological and acoustic facts, much more problematic. • Julia L.J. Sanchez: "Procession and Performance: Recreating Ritual Soundscapes among the Ancient Maya," 35^4. Abstract : Processions among the ancient Maya included music, dance, costumes, and theatrical perfor- mances and took place in public spaces. This paper relates performance and space to examine public ceremonies, exploring the limits of archaeological interpretation of such ephemeral aesthetic experi- ences. Large public ceremonies also are used to illuminate similar practices that occurred on a smaller scale in more private contexts. • Susan Rawcliffe: "Eight West Mexican Flutes in the Fowler Museum," 45-65. Abstract : The small selection of West Mexican flutes discussed in this article has a remarkable variety of body shape, scales, and distinctive timbres. Different types and timbres were surely associated with different uses. Although flute families usually share a characteristic timbre, potential playing tech- niques including the number of finger holes, and some interval similarities and pitch ranges, the actual details typically remain unique to each flute. With no fully standardized flute body shapes or mouth- pieces, there can be no fully standardized scales. Possibly, with prehispanic flutes, exact pitch is a lesser value than expressiveness. Construction details enhance the capacities for pitch bending, for the ma- nipulation of timbre through breath pressure, and perhaps for utilizing the eerie whistle tones that may emerge with very low air pressure. Expressivity may be the primary aesthetic value functioning here. • Gonzalo Sánchez Santiago: "An Introduction to the Music Cultures of Ancient Oaxaca: Sound Artifacts in the Archaeological Record," 67-79. Abstract This paper discusses the sound artifacts from archaeological excavations made in the present- day State of Oaxaca, Mexico. The finds reveal the rich diversity of ancient music cultures such as the Zapotee, Mixtee, and Mixe-Zoque. Based on the organological data, important aspects of the musical history of this cultural area can be reconstructed. • Ángel Agustín Pimentel Díaz: "Music Iconography of the Code x Nuttall ," 81-90.

Abstract : This paper reviews the ethnohistoric record of the Aztec music culture that flourished during the Late Postclassic period of Mesoamerica, AD 1325-1521. The written sources from the early colo- nial period suggest that among the Aztecs a differentiation was made between temple music practiced by specialized priests and court music practiced by professional musicians. Moreover, information is related on the religious concepts of sound, revealing important insights into the musical knowledge of Late Postclassic Mesoamerica. In this context, also archaeological and music iconographical data is considered. • Mark Howell: "Possible Prehispanic Music Survivals in the Rab 'inai Achi " 105-38. Abstract The Rab 'inai Achi is a K'iche' Maya dance-play preserved in text that may have been first performed in highland Guatemala during the Postclassic era (AD 900-1524). It is still performed in Ra- binal, Guatemala, and two valveless trumpets and a slit-drum produce the music used in its accompani- ment. These instruments are known to be prehispanic and the music played on them for this dance-play may retain prehispanic elements. To examine this possibility, music for the Rab 'inai Achi is compared to the music accompanying a dance-play introduced from Spain, the Baile de los Moros y Cristianos.

Articles • Karl Neuenfeldt: "Notes on the Engagement of Indigenous Peoples with Recording Technology and Techniques, the Recording Industry and Researchers," 7-2 1 . Abstract : The relationships between Indigenous peoples, recording technology and techniques, the recording industry and researchers have been evolving for over a century, as have concerns for key issues such as intellectual property, copyright, commercialization and cultural protocols. As technol- ogy and techniques have changed so too has the nature of the relationships, although there are also continuities. This issue of the world of music focuses on some of those changes and continuities. The articles explore, describe and analyze examples of these current relationships as Indigenous peoples in Australia, Easter Island, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Northern Europe, North America and Solomon Islands engage with - and in some instances manipulate and subvert - recording technology and techniques and the recording industry. Also surveyed are the roles of researchers involved in col- laborative projects. • Beverly Diamond: "'Allowing the Listener to Fly as They Want to': Sámi Perspectives on Indigenous CD Production in Northern Europe," 23^8. Abstract : Since the Saami cultural renaissance that began in the late 1 970s, contemporary Saami re- cording artists have found ways to reflect traditional cultural values and practices in the recording studio. Many initially deny any relationship between live and studio work. Because the tradition of yoiking in a community setting is so reliant on audience feedback, the performance of a yoik without an audience is a particular challenge. In the studio, however, Saami musicians find ways to maintain the yoik' s ability to define relationships to people, places, and animals. They also exploit the studio to layer meanings, thus extending the yoik's capacity for double entendre. This article reports on interviews with a number of producers and recording artists, including Ulla Pirtijarvi, Ursula Lansman, and Mari Boine. It focuses in particular on the studio work of Wimme Saari and Frode Fjellheim. • Àse Ottosson: "'We're Just Bush Mob': Producing Aboriginal Music and Maleness in a Central Australian Recording Studio," 49-63. Abstract : Over the last sixty years, country, rock and reggae music have become important everyday expressive forms among Aboriginal people in Central Australia. In this particular socio-musical scene, these forms of music have emerged as an almost exclusively male activity. The recording studio of the vol. 49, 2007 (1)</page><page sequence="33">2. Contents and Abstracts *51 Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association in Alice Springs likewise continues to constitute a socio-musical space dominated by Aboriginal men from diverse backgrounds. This paper explores the ways in which the musicians and studio workers assert and negotiate a diverse range of ancestral and more recent local and global forms of accumulating male respect and status as they work with each other in the professional and technological regimes of this studio. In the process they reproduce as well as rework their distinctive and shared sense of worth as Aboriginal music makers and men. • Brian Diettrich: "Across All Micronesia and Beyond: Innovation and Connections in Chuukese Popular Music and Contemporary Recordings," 65-8 1 . Abstract Today in Chuuk State, part of the Federated States of Micronesia, due to increasing access to music and digital technology, the production of popular music flourishes. Formerly, in the 1980s, popular music consisted mostly of locally made tape recordings of performances. Since the 1990s, however, Islanders have increasingly made use of computers and compact disks to access and distrib- ute the latest popular hits. The demand for popular CDs in Chuuk, usually of love songs and well-liked church songs, is not only propelled by access to technology in Chuuk, but is strongly influenced by large populations of Chuukese in Guam and Hawaii, as well as the U.S. mainland. Contemporary popu- lar music performance for Chuukese serves as a means of connecting the experiences of transnational communities across the space of the Pacific and beyond. • Karl Neuenfeldt: "'Bring the Past to Present': Recording and Reviving Rotuman Music via a Collaborative Rotuman/Fijian/Australian CD Project," 83-103. Abstract : This paper explores a recording project that led to CDs documenting Rotuman musical performances and music practice in Suva, Fiji. The project was collaboration between the Rotuman diasporic community, the Oceania Centre for the Arts and Culture at the University of the South Pacific and a music-based researcher from Australia. It uses description, analysis and ethnographies to explore the role of digital technologies; the role and evolution of music in diasporic communities in Australia and Fiji; the benefits and challenges of collaborative transnational musical research projects; and the role of music researchers as music producers. • Katelyn Barney: "Sending a Message: How Indigenous Australian Women use Contemporary Music Recording Technologies to Provide a Space for Agency, Viewpoints and Agendas," 105-24. Abstract Home studios, local small scale recording studios and the Internet provide an important space for many Indigenous Australian women performers to enact agency in deciding how their music will sound. They enjoy creative freedom and individual expression in producing recordings of their music. With reference to discourse on women and music technology, this article examines how record- ing practices provide the tools with which Indigenous Australian women performers raise awareness of political and social justice issues, which affect Indigenous Australians. Conclusions will be drawn regarding the ways recording technologies and the recording studio functions in this context as a space to create music that is sending a message of confidence, social power, control, and agency. • Dan Bendrups: "Easter Island Music and the Voice of Kiko Pate: A Biographical History of Sound Recording," 1 25-4 1 . Abstract This article provides a history of sound recording on Easter Island (Rapanui) through the biography of Rapanui master musician Luis Avaka "Kiko" Pate. Albums of Rapanui music began to appear internationally in the 1970s in the form of field recordings produced by outsider ethnographers and commercial recordings by amateur enthusiasts. In the following decades, Rapanui musicians de- veloped their own interests in sound recording, and many musicians are now fluent in music produc- tion processes. Throughout this history of production, Kiko Pate has played an unparalleled role in determining the ways in which perceived traditional music forms are remembered and recorded. The conceptualization of tradition has become a defining feature of Rapanui culture in the twenty-first cen- tury, and the performances and recordings of new generations of musicians owe much of their success to the earlier revitalization efforts of Kiko Pate. His role in this recording history is, however, not im- mediately apparent because all of the extant recordings featuring Kiko Pate's distinctive voice are the</page><page sequence="34">52 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) result of outsider research and production emphasize exotic content over performer identity.

Abstract : The music industry of the Solomon Islands exists essentially outside the transnational Anglo- phone and European music industries. Piracy of overseas and local material is rampant, and artists are often at the mercy of companies in control of all parts of the recording and distribution process. This article presents a case study exploring the role of a "grassroots" home studio in a regionally insular yet vibrantly commercial scene. It also explores ways musicians manage their careers in this environment, the impact of Chinese mercantile interests and issues of copyright. The case study is ethnographic in nature, drawing upon musicians' perspectives on the role of recording technology and the recording industry in their region. • James E. Cunningham: "The Nammys Versus the Grammys: Celebrity, Technology, and the Creation of an Indigenous Music Recording Industry in North America," 155-70. Abstract : The Native American Music Awards, N.A.M.A., was founded as a showcase for Native American "people and youth" from "the four directions." Patterned after the annual Grammy Music Awards, the organization's annual Nammy awards ceremony is a prime opportunity for contemporary Native American musicians to present themselves as a unified industry. Since its inception in 1998, approximately thirty awards have been presented annually to artists, songwriters, and producers in a wide variety of popular, traditional, and historical categories. The annual ceremonies also include the presentation of Lifetime Achievement, Humanitarian, and Hall of Fame Awards. Using the Eighth An- nual Native American Music Awards, held June 8, 2006 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, as a locus for investigation, this article explores how the Nammys incorporate celebrity and technology as an important means for the establishment of an indigenized music record- ing industry. • Jeniffer Cattermole: '"Fiji Blues?': Taveuni and Qamea Musicians' Engagements with Recording Technologies," 171-87. Abstract : This article explores and discusses indigenous Fijian's (/ taukei ) engagement with the record- ing industry and recording technologies more generally. It focuses specifically on bands from Taveuni and the neighboring island of Qamea. They are used as case studies to examine the role of recording technologies in small island cultures. There are no recording studios on either but in the past; the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation recorded bands on Taveuni using a mobile recording unit. Due to the pro- hibitive cost of journeying to recording studios, it is mainly the resort bands (funded by resort own- ers) who have been recorded, as well as some recordings made by visiting tourists and musicians. The Taveuni and Qamea musicians' experiences of being recorded, the distribution of their recordings, the negotiation of commercial arrangements between themselves and resort management and tourists are analyzed, along with the recording relationships between musicians and a music researcher.

Abstract As its title suggests, this issue appears as a follow-up to the preceding one, allowing further voices to be heard in an ongoing discussion of a multi-faceted, highly significant and essentially enor- mous field of music research. Collectively, the contributions make the point that the issues at stake are not new ones, concerning indeed such fundamental questions as what is music, whether it is actually possible to say that music evolves at all, how we might analyze and account for the global distribu- tion of musical styles and style features, and to what political ends we put such analytical claims. New answers to these enduring questions are suggested, along with fresh ways of looking back at earlier answers, and Leroi and Swire make explicit an invitation which is implicit in the other articles too, namely that there is plenty of space for ethnomusicologists to join other researchers in pushing further at the boundaries of what we know about the emergence and long history of music worldwide. To do so, we will need to become more accustomed to thinking on the larger-scale but, in doing so, we can draw on the perspectives and techniques in a growing body of new research, much of it referenced in the articles below. Accustomed collaborators in fieldwork situations, ethnomusicologists may also find research in this field is a good place to engage in team-based study and analysis with input from more than one disciplinary perspective. • Victor A. Grauer: "Echoes of Our Forgotten Ancestors: Some Points of Clarification," 9-12. vol 48, 2006 (3)</page><page sequence="36">54 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : In the interest of correcting certain misinterpretations that might have arisen from a reading of his essay, "Echoes of Our Forgotten Ancestors," the author has presented a clarification with respect to both the role of Alan Lomax and the nature of the Canlometric System he pioneered. What may not have been made sufficiently clear was, first the importance of Lomax's role in establishing the founda- tions of Cantometrics, as well as its subsequent development, and, second, the fact that many key ideas in the essay were based on Lomax's insights. The author also wants it understood that, despite some comments of his that might have been interpreted otherwise, Cantometrics is indeed in his view a valid and useful scientic methodology. • Rachel Mundy: "Musical Evolution and the Making of Hierarchy," 13-27. Abstract : In the period between the two World Wars, evolutionism played a substantial role in a series of anti-Semitic trends that permeated the formation and reception of American modern music. The ordering principle of evolutionism, when applied to the association of racial difference with musical style, resulted in the creation of a social hierarchy of high and low art music that reinforced already extant racial hierarchies. Tracing the lineage of this tradition of musical evolutionism to the present day suggests the continued entanglement of music scholars, like myself, in evolutionary questions. • Matthew Rahaim: "What Else Do We Say When We Say 'Music Evolves?'," 29^1 . Abstract Whether speaking of musical "ancestors," "development," "adaptation," or "survival," music scholars implicitly draw connections between the change in biological and musical forms over time. These connections do not amount to rigorous applications of evolutionary theory. Instead, they func- tion as metaphors used creatively to account for musical change. I see two broad systems of evolution metaphors, which I call "progressive" and "local" evolution. Progressive evolution (informed by meta- phors of development and linear motion) sees musical forms gradually improving over time. Local evolution (informed by metaphors of fitting into place) sees musical forms adapting to dynamic local conditions. Each metaphorical system carries entailments about the future, value, and proper place of music. I argue that evolution metaphors, while sometimes useful, carry political implications that can easily be made explicit. • Armand M. Leroi and Jonathan Swire: "The Recovery of the Past," 43-54. Abstract : Songs, like genes and languages, evolve. That means it should be possible to infer their history from their present geographical distributions. We outline one approach to doing so that we have developed based on the Cantometric song-style data collected by Alan Lomax between 1961 and 1994. We then discuss a recent claim that the migration of anatomically modern humans out of Africa c. 70,000 years ago has left traces in the global distribution of song-style, and argue that it is founded on a misapplication of phylogenetic theory and practise. Finally, we discuss the prospects for a new, evolutionary, science of song. • Ian Cross: "Four Issues in the Study of Music in Evolution," 55-63. Abstract : This paper responds to articles published in the world of music 48, no. 2 (2006) on the topic of music's emergence and spread around the world, addressing four issues raised there. First, the no- tion that musical style has the capacity to be conserved and transmitted over very long time-scales is assessed. It is suggested that there is a little direct support for this in the archaeological record, but only from a cultural environment quite distinct from that inhabited by the ancestors of today's Pygmies and Bushmen. Second, attention is given to the extent to which theories concerning the details of cultural process can be securely tied to the detailed scientific literature on human evolution. This is a quickly changing field, both in terms of genetic testing techniques and in terms of scientific interpretations: it may be premature to propose detailed interpretations of something as complex as musical practices at this stage. The notion that stasis appears as a norm in cultural process is the third issue examined, in the light of emerging research on cultural modeling in relation to evolution, which suggests that stasis is by no means automatic or inevitable. Finally, the response proposes that we understand "music" as a means of managing social uncertainty. If so, then the recurrence of musical features from one society to another may not show historical linkage but rather the persistence, or the continual re-emergence, of particular patterns in social interaction.</page><page sequence="37">2.

Abstract : Recent developments in the field of genetic anthropology suggest that our earliest fully "modern" ancestors originated in Africa between 1 50,000 and 200,000 years ago, and that a single band of their descendents migrated from that continent to Asia between 60,000 and 90,000 years ago, destined to populate the rest of the world. The so-called "Out-of- Africa," paradigm has opened the door to all sorts of new possibilities regarding our understanding of human history and culture. Draw- ing on experience gained during my years of involvement, with Alan Lomax, on the Cantometrics project, supplemented by extensive independent research, I attempt to demonstrate how the new ge- netic findings could lead to a general re-evaluation of the history, development, and significance of mankind's earliest music. • Bruno Netti: "Response to Victor Grauer: On the Concept of Evolution in the History of Ethnomusicology," 59-72. Abstract : This short essay responds to Grauer in the first instance by voicing agreement with his inter- est in reviving cantometrics and moving further along the lines sketched by Lomax. It reflects surprise at the relative neglect, by ethnomusicologists, of the issues raised by cantometrics after c. 1970, and goes on to associate cantometrics with its historical antecedents, the well-known work of Curt Sachs and of adherents of the American "culture area" approach to the interpretation of geographic distribu- tions. Most of the essay is devoted to comments on a movement that has become known as "evolution- ary musicology" which are directly or indirectly raised by Grauer. These involve the origins of music, the (sometimes incorrectly labeled) evolutionary approach to universal music history, and the interpre- tation of music as a biological adaptation. It is in evolutionary musicology that the influence of Lomax and cantometrics is most evident. • Jonathan P.J. Stock: "Clues from Our Present Peers?: A Response to Victor Grauer," 73-91. Abstract. This response to Victor A. Grauer's "Echoes of Our Forgotten Ancestors" draws on present- day musical data, including the singing of Pygmies from Gabon, women from the Solomon Islands, carollers from Sheffield and Pennsylvania, and the music-related interactions of mother-baby couples. Initially, I note that generalization and comparison is prevalent as a context in contemporary ethno- musicology, and distinguish the kind of demands a general account places on its individual pieces of evidence as compared to a more ethnographically focused analysis. Four further conditions are then identified, all of which need to be met for Grauer's account to be persuasive. First, Grauer needs to make a fully convincing case for what he calls the "Pygmy-Bushman style": I argue that he misses essential differences in musical practice between these peoples and misidentifies a single cluster of traits concomitant with hocketing as an unusual series of selections. Second, I sug- gest that Grauer has selected some examples to fit his theory, rather than vice versa, a problem that leads him to see signs of migration in what may rather be routine outcomes of the normative structure and performance practice of the panpipes. The third condition is concerned with the matter of musical val. 48, 2006 (2)</page><page sequence="39">2. Contents and Abstracts • 57 change, which Grauer's account essentially omits: examples are given of styles that changed radi- cally in a short period, all of which show that the acoustic surface of the music appears to be its most changeable element, and that present-day recordings may not be a reliable guide to the musical style of prehistory. The fourth condition Grauer's hypothesis demands is that hocketing was invented just once in human history; this requirement too is problematic, the same technique occurring in many mother- infant musical interactions. In sum, while the account of early human migrations presented by the "out- of-Africa" scientists may be plausible, evidence of musical transmission 70,000 years ago has yet to be located. The search for that evidence will need to look at performance practice, not just acoustics. • Peter Cooke: "Response to 'Echoes of Our Forgotten Ancestors'," 93-100. Abstract : From Victor Grauer's introductory essay it is apparent that he is embarking on an interesting and challenging research task in musical history - or perhaps one might call it musical archaeology. Archaeologists are often forced to speculate (with very little hard evidence) and only later do chance discoveries or systematic excavations produce the necessary evidence that confounds or validates their speculations. The new evidence for Grauer exists already, in the form of the massive addition to the documentation of the world's musical traditions that ethnomusicologists have contributed since he was working with Lomax on the Cantometrics project in the 1960s. There may now be few new "sites" to excavate - but there is now so much more social and cultural information on the many varied musical traditions of the world with which to help one validate the initial work of style analysis and compari- son. • Victor A. Grauer: "'Echoes of Our Forgotten Ancestors' - Author's Reply," 101-34. Abstract: This paper selects comments from the preceding three invited responses by Bruno Netti, Peter Cooke, and Jonathan Stock and replies to them one by one. The first part proposes a workable definition of music and discusses the issue of origins. This leads to a further discussion of Cantometrics as a means of general hypothesis and thoughts on evolutionary musicology and universais. Generaliza- tion is also an issue in the second part of the paper, where it is followed with comments on "emics" and "etics" and on the role of context. Materials proposed by Stock as counter-examples to my initial essay are then discussed in more detail. Turning next to Cooke's responses, I focus particularly on aspects re- lated to the bagpipes and to what I called the "breathless" style of singing. Finally, the paper concludes by arguing that the "Out-of-Africa" theory provides the simplest explanation by far of the widespread distribution of music among virtually all peoples today. Miscellanea • Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph and Martin Watt: "Musical Symbiosis in Jeanne Zaidel- Rudolph's Lifecycle," 135-50. Abstract : This article engages with the various modalities applied in the "juxtaposed" genre of written composition in a South African art music context. It explores the aesthetic and socio-cultural implica- tions of music embodying an oral-written synergy. Examples are cited as precedents of musical "sym- biosis" which seek to integrate and enrich music from diverse cultures. This study traces the germina- tion and realization of the intercultural work, Lifecycle , by Jeanne Zaidel-Rudolph, which grew out of an investigative field study into the indigenous music of the amaXhosa women, as performed by the Ngqoko singers. It outlines the challenges of the transcription process and scrutinises how the unique mode of "overtone" singing employed by the women was to inspire a new soundscape concept and a new symbiotic compositional vocabulary. The paper gives an overview of the original Xhosa songs and demonstrates how the composer of Lifecycle created a tapestry of interdependent musical genres within a fresh symbiotic whole. • Marin Marian-Bãlaça: "Ghizela/Gisela Suliteanu: An Indicative Bio-Bibliography," 151-61.

Abstract Children's expressive practices have been the object of extensive scholarly study in the dis- ciplines of folklore, anthropology, and linguistics, but the study of children and childhood in ethnomu- sicology has been somewhat more sporadic (Minks 2002). In spite of a few seminal texts by prominent scholars, ethnomusicologists have largely avoided a topic that may not have seemed sufficiently "seri- ous" in the process of institutionalizing a small and vulnerable discipline. In recent decades, music edu- cators with expertise in ethnomusicological methods have almost single-handedly carried on the tasks of exploring children's musical practices and experiences across cultural contexts. A new generation of scholars is emerging within ethnomusicology to build on this past work and push it in new directions, but some may still face challenges by advisors who dissuade them from research with children either because it is perceived as a less serious topic, or because of the necessity of obtaining approval from academic review boards - a process which can be tedious but has not caused scholars in psychology, sociology, or other fields to abandon research with children. • Kathryn Marsh: "Cycles of Appropriation in Children's Musical Play: Orality in the Age of Reproduction," 9-32. Abstract: Children's musical play is a spontaneous form of expression encompassing a range of forms which vary according to age and locality. For school-aged children in primary school playgrounds, genres of musical play include those that are part of an oral tradition, such as singing games, the sung and chanted games that are owned, performed and orally transmitted by children. In the course of oral transmission, these games are varied, often intentionally, through processes of formulaic construction. Children appropriate formulae from the adult world, drawing in particular on mediated sources for their material, but manipulating the source material as a form of resistance to and subversion of the hegemonies of the adult world. In children's dialogue with the media, cycles of appropriation emerge and similarities between the generative aesthetics of musical play and popular music can be identi- fied. In particular, the intertextual ity within these two linked performative traditions is explored. This exploration is based on a cross-cultural study of children's musical play entailing extensive periods of ethnographic fieldwork in predominantly multiethnic schools in the UK, Norway, USA, South Korea, and in urban and remote locations in Australia. • Anthony Seeger and Kate Seeger: "Beyond the Embers of the Campfìre: The Ways of Music at a Residential Summer Children's Camp, "33-65. Abstract : Nearly 1 1 million children and adults attend over 12,000 summer camps in the United States each year. Singing and other forms of music making are an important part of the camp experience. Unlike schools, camps usually encourage music making in a variety of contexts. In spite of its signifi- cance, the music of summer camps has rarely received scholarly attention. The authors review music making at Camp Killooleet, their family's residential summer camp for the past 56 years, and consider some 130 LP records made at other summer camps by Alma Mater records. We describe how chil- dren are exposed to music and how some aspects of their experience have changed while others have remained very much the same over the decades. We also describe methods we have used to create a vibrant musical experience for all campers. In order to understand and encourage the rich musical life of children, researchers must include consideration of how music is made and experienced at summer camps. • Marie Agatha Ozah: "The Iwali Child Queen Dance of Ogoja, Nigeria," 67-82. Abstract In the Bekwarra and Yala cultures, the figure of the iwali , otsichwi or ochuole represents aspects of religious as well as socio-political beliefs and activities. The child chosen to be an iwali is a symbolic representation of the embodiment of womanhood and also a custodian and transmitter of culture. The various attributes of the iwali find expression in dance, which is the principal obligation of her daily life. Through training and practice, the iwali gains full control over her instrument, her body and her art. This article focuses on the iwali, discussing how music and dance are integrated to form</page><page sequence="42">60 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) vital aspects of her life. This article in addition considers the inherent balancing of irreplaceable tradi- tions with varying degrees of change brought about by modernity. • Rita de Cácia Oenning da Silva: "Reversing the Rite: Music, Dance, and Rites of Passage among Street Children and Youth in Recife, Brazil," 83-97. Abstract : This article is based on fieldwork in marginalized neighborhoods of Recife and Olinda, Bra- zil, in 2004 and 2005. It analyzes children's artistic performances as rites of passage, seeing them as spaces where children and adolescents can test and express their competence and creativity, while at the same time creating an identity far from the common association of poverty with drug-based crimi- nality. Significantly, in these rites, children and adolescents do not only play the role of neophytes, but also that of educators, teaching each other, the local society, and regional and national actors about conditions in the impoverished communities of Brazil's Northeast. • Yee Ming To: "Shifting Identity and Disappearing Childhood in Hong Kong Children's Songs," 99-109. Abstract: In contemporary Hong Kong, the term yi goh is a genre label referring to mass-mediated children's songs. Since it emerged in the 1970s, this genre has undergone a transformation from songs with children's lyrics performed by children to songs performed by adolescents and adults with lyrics that are often inappropriate or incomprehensible to children. This article discusses the historical con- text of yi goh and its contemporary mass-mediated context. As a colonized city, Hong Kong is a place with strong ties to Britain and to China, and both cultures influence the self-image and ideology of people in Hong Kong in all aspects. Interviews with yi goh composers reveal some of the motivations and methods of production, and an analysis of the music industry reveals a merging of this formerly child-oriented genre with mass popular music. The result is a distortion and virtual disappearance of the concept of childhood from yi goh. • Roe-Min Kok: "Of Kindergarten, Cultural Nationalism, and Schumann's Album for the Young," 111-32. Abstract : As scholars of nationalism continue to unravel the complex interrelationships between cre- ative intellectual labor and political preferences, and to plumb how national identities were and con- tinue to be experienced in everyday contexts, children and the roles they play - or are assigned - in constructed national consciousness have come under close scrutiny. Since the French Revolution, for instance, children had been viewed as political capital whose education should be directed towards their future roles as citizens of the state, a concept that caught on across Europe in the early decades of the nineteenth century. This essay places children's music, specifically Schumann's Album for the Young , within the context of the controversial kindergarten movement in Vormärz Germany. Friedrich Froebel, founder of the kindergarten, believed that a German national identity could be achieved through edu- cating the young regardless of their social backgrounds. His ideas were greeted with much suspicion by Prussian authorities who imposed a ban on all kindergartens in 1851. Schumann, who leaned towards the political left, sent his daughters to a Froebelian kindergarten in Dresden between 1846 and 1848. Towards the end of their stay at the school, and in the midst of the continuing political upheavals of that revolutionary year, he composed the Album for the Young. I argue that the Album contains elements of cultural nationalism that drew upon contemporary pedagogical concepts. Book Reviews (Helena B. Simonett, ed.) • Jay Keister: "Dale A. Olsen.

Abstract : With the current globalization of communications and connections between today's societies, cultures are inevitably influencing each other although not to the same extent. All aspects of today's Western technologies, thoughts, politics, economics, science, arts, music, etc., are permeating many, if not most aspects of all non- Western cultures. In many parts of the world, modernity is equated with Westernization, and many traditions are "trampled" to make way for this so-called Western modernity, which sometimes is equated with some kind of universality The same phenomenon applies to music as well. In many places, traditional forms of music are now seen by natives as archaic and antiquated. Some are actually altered to conform to the Western paradigm. Over time, these alterations might slowly deprive them of their traditional heritage. Nowadays, even when new forms of music are cre- ated, they are basically molded to the so-called modern, thus Western standards. Witnessing this trend, some scholars even believe that in some parts of the world, some traditional forms of music are nearly on the verge of being swept away by Westernization. The impression is that non- Western societies are being imposed a one-way form of acculturation. • Steven Casano: "From Fuke Shuu to (Jdu boo : The Transnational Flow of the Shakuhachi to the West," 17-33.</page><page sequence="44">62 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : Just as Japan has been economically and technologically influential worldwide, its artistic and cultural forms have also been influential on a global level. Over the past thirty years, the shaku- hachi , a Japanese end-blown bamboo flute, has steadily grown in popularity throughout the West. In Japan, the shakuhachi developed from an instrument utilized by the Zen Buddhist priests of the Fuke Shuu (Fuke sect) in a form of meditation known as suizen (blowing Zen) to an instrument, which is presently used internationally not only for meditation, but also in movie soundtracks, contemporary compositions by Western-trained composers, and even Jazz. Since the mid-to-late 1960s, the shaku- hachi tradition has steadily grown in popularity in the Western world. This is evident with the growing number of non-Japanese recordings, Web pages, publications, compositions, local shakuhachi organi- zations, and e-mail groups. • Jay Keister: "Seeking Authentic Experience: Spirituality in Western Appropriation of Asian Music," 35-53. Abstract : Spirituality is a highly problematic topic of study, yet it is crucial to understanding how West- erners appropriate and experience music cross-culturally. A discourse of spirituality in which Western- ers construct notions of an authentic, exotic other is particularly common in the appropriation of Asian music. In their encounters with Asian music, Westerners sometimes take an approach that could be de- scribed as spiritual, but not religious, meaning that the spiritual power of music lies in the individual's direct experience with the music unrestricted by the doctrines, texts and social practices that govern musical practice in an Asian context. Although many Westerners do participate in a master-disciple relationship typical of many Asian traditions, some take what can be described as a "seeker" approach to spirituality that rejects such traditional social organization as overly "religious" and antithetical to a spiritually authentic experience of music. Spiritual experiences of Japanese music are examined in this paper, particularly music of the shakuhachi flute in which ideas of spirituality are common and explicitly expressed. • Anas Ghrab: "The Western Study of Intervals in 'Arabic Music,' from the Eighteenth Century to the Cairo Music Congress," 55-79. Abstract This article explores the history of the work done on music intervals in Arabic music by Westerners during the last three centuries. This analysis tries to unveil the theoretical precepts underly- ing their work and uncovers the assumptions it had on understanding the original literature on Arabic musical theory. Moreover, although the basic interests behind this exploration differed from one re- searcher to the others, some of the ideas put forward were extremely influential. They served to put forth strong clichés thought to be representative of the music of the Arab world. Finally, although this theoretical veil, we can discern a historical evolution which is closely linked to the historical rapport between the European and Arab cultures. • Christopher J. Miller: "Orchids (and Other Difficult Flowers) Revisited: A Reflection on Composing for Gamelan in North America, 81-1 1 1 . Abstract : The creative engagement of North American composers with Indonesian music has pro- duced a great diversity of work. Focusing primarily on new music for Javanese gamelan , and drawing largely on my own experience as a composer with a significant involvement in the performance of traditional music, this article examines the variety of approaches taken by composers and ensembles and the different relationships to tradition they imply or embody. Arguing that creative activity cannot be understood apart from the broader presence of Indonesian music, I attempt a realistic assessment of gamelan'' s existence in North America on both a philosophical and practical level. I relate the basis of my own interest in the music, and recount some of the history of the group in which I started, a group which managed to avoid the schism which generally persists between composition and traditional performance. In examining different compositional approaches, I point to the interconnectedness of instruments and musical ideas, the problems with simple imitation, and the importance of the situations in which work is created, determined largely by the musicians involved. • Christian Utz: "Beyond Cultural Representation: Recent Works for the Asian Mouth Organs Shõ and Sheng by Western Composers," 1 13-34.</page><page sequence="45">2. Contents and Abstracts • 63 Abstract : One notable effect of musical globalization is the increasing presence of Asian instruments in works by Western composers, a phenomenon that could only very rarely be observed in Western new music up to the 1980s. The international activities of Asian musicians, though sometimes triggered by Western initiative, have afforded opportunities for creative collaborations with composers looking for more precise, comprehensive and "ernie" information on these instruments - as opposed to the second- ary materials available to most Western composers in the past. This article focuses on the key question: how do these composers attempt to transform this information into new compositional concepts and how do they confront the cultural symbolism and the idiosyncrasies of the Asian instruments? Most prominently, the Japanese mouth organ shõ and, more recently, its Chinese analogue, the sheng , have proved very attractive to Western composers of different generations and origin. Examples from works by Helmut Lachenmann, Chaya Czernowin, Klaus Huber, Gerhard Stäbler, Robert H.P. Platz, John Cage, Heinz Reber, Jorge Sánchez-Chiong and Wolfgang Suppan exemplify a plurality of perspectives on these two instruments and their "cultural" significance within a Western musical discourse. Finally, two compositions by the author are introduced to illustrate how a bi-cultural instrumentation can lead to complex structural stratification aimed at aesthetic and aural ambiguity and multi-perspectivity. • Tanya Kalmanovitch: "Jazz and Karnatic Music: Intercultural Collaboration in Pedagogical Perspective," 135-60. Abstract As a uniquely intercultural music, jazz has been shaped by its joint African and European patrimony, as well as a host of local and distant musical "others." Among these, Indian classical mu- sics play a special role: an awareness of Indian music is part of the contemporary jazz consciousness, and jazz musicians have frequently looked to Indian classical music as a source of both musical and extra-musical inspiration. Karnatic music - long marginalized in India and abroad - is emerging in the twenty-first century as a site of specific aesthetic and pedagogical interest in jazz. This paper reports on an educational exchange project between the Jazz and Contemporary Music Program of the New School University (New York) and the Brhaddhvani Research and Training Centre for Musics of the World (Chennai), directed by the author in December 2003-January 2004, in collaboration with Dr. Karaikudi S.

Notes on the Modern Rise of a Method and the Postmodern Fall of an Ideology," 5-29. Abstract This article surveys samples of theoretical contributions to the discussion of problems and developments of the major and basic ethnomusicological pillar that is transcription. It also summarizes issues raised at a recent meeting of the European Seminar in Ethnomusicology. Ideas and practices that are pro- and anti-"faithful" or microscopic transcription are analyzed, and the possible pluses and minuses offered by computer programs mentioned. Yet, the major concern here revolves around the ignored aspect of ideology, and so this paper puts forward a critique which revisits and questions our view of transcription from the perspective of both its first grounds and multidirectional ultimate meanings. In the light of a postmodern critique, what was traditionally conceived and performed as open method is now tackled and discussed as covert ideology. In the end, the issue of transcription is revealed as one of the gates musicology and musicologists set up to act, unwarily but efficiently, as makers of specific politics - the politics of ethnomusicology - which is similar to other ideological and political processes. • Rytis Ambrazevičius: "The Perception and Transcription of the Scale Reconsidered: Several Lithuanian Cases7W/«w Ojamaa ," 31-53. Abstract : The adequate transcription of musical scale can be quite problematic because of the biased perception of the scale. This is demonstrated by a thorough examination of the tunings of skudučiai (Lithuanian multi-pipe whistles) and the scales of Lithuanian traditional singing. Original "emic" scales are reconstructed on the basis of acoustic measurements: they show essential differences from the scales encoded in the conventional Western staff transcriptions, i. e., not only do the scales differ in microtones, but also the pitch classifications are completely dissimilar. The use of Hornbostel's para- digm and its alternatives to visualize the specific features of scale are discussed. • Triinu Ojamaa: "Throat Rasping: Problems of Visualization," 55-69. Abstract : This article discusses a particular vocal technique of the North Siberian Nganasan, called throat rasping, in reference to the specific sounds made. Such rasping sounds are used to imitate a bird or an animal. The problems analyzed are: 1) what kind of additional information does visualization provide to that obtained by ear; and 2) what are the techniques used by the performer to produce an intended timbre. The research process included different methodologies: audio-visual analysis of a dance; interviews with indigenous performers and with a professional singer with Western music edu- cation; spectral analysis of rasping sounds (programme Multi-Speech Model 3700, Version 2.5); and an experiment where an outsider imitated an insider. Since throat rasping is a musical artifact encountered only in the circumpolar region, and because it does not concur with the European concept of music, some musicologists consider throat rasping to be just extra musical sound. Scholars of Siberian music have tried to analyze rasping, because the tradition carriers themselves perceive this phenomenon as music. Research in this field has continued for decades, but only through listening-based study. While</page><page sequence="47">2. Contents and Abstracts • 65 admitting the limited capacities of human ear, more would be expected from a computer analysis, which can expose deeper structures of the phenomenon examined. The current study, however, results in a conclusion that spectral analysis cannot actually provide any essential information in addition - it may only prove or disprove the impression already obtained. • Regine Allgayer-Kaufmann: "From the Innocent to the Exploring Eye: Transcription on the Defensive," 71-86. Abstract From the very first moment on Carl Stumpf and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel started to tran- scribe the music they received from all over the world. They followed the example of musical scores in Western music. Hornbostel believed in the possibility of faithful transcriptions, yet the myth of the innocent eye was not yet exposed as such. Only in the 1950s transcription came under the crossfire of criticism when a new generation of ethnomusicologists challenged - from an anthropological point of view - the usefulness of transcriptions. They argued against ethnocentrism, which in their opinion had shown up here as sound centrism. Anyway, there are still transcribing ethnomusicologists today. In this article we scrutinize closely three examples. Obviously there are many different systems used today analogous to the contents that have become manifold. Aside from this it turns out that ethnomusicolo- gists today do not at all use their transcriptions for exploring, i.e. they do not explore with their eyes, instead, they explore with their ears and their body. The purpose of transcriptions has turned out to be mainly to communicate knowledge that was obtained by these other means. It is finally communicated by transcriptions to those, who give credit to such pictures because they do not have a possibility to experience it otherwise. • Gerd Grupe: "Notating African Music: Issues and Concepts," 87-103. Abstract : Some 100 years ago Carl Stumpf and Erich M. von Hornbostel promoted what they called the phonographic method as the central means for studies of foreign musics. Transcriptions have been regarded as an indispensable prerequisite for any scholarly analysis of orally and aurally transmitted music ever since. In the light of claims that the visual domain might be an unnecessary or even inappro- priate way of approaching music, it may be necessary to reassess the issue of why we need to visualize the music we study. By looking at musics from sub-Saharan Africa it can be demonstrated that listening alone is not always effective and reliable in understanding music: in many cases, for instance, there is a difference between played parts and the aural impression. In order to reconstruct this relationship some sort of notation is needed. Another case in point is the exploration of the motional dimension in African music particularly in respect to 'patterned movement' (John Baily) in instrumental playing. If we, therefore, cannot do without the visual representation of sounds, which notation system is suited best to our ends? What has become of Mantle Hood's three possible solutions to this question? Are there specific traits in African musics which require special kinds of notation or is there any universally applicable system? In presenting two case studies, it will be shown that different purposes may call for different ways of representation, that more specialized systems may be more appropriate than Western staff notation in certain cases, and that a combination of notation and tablature may be advisable in order to account for specific structural aspects of some African musical idioms. • Wim van der Meer: "Visions of Hindustani Music," 105-18. Abstract : There are many visual reflections of Indian music; in dance, painting and sculpture but also through writing, transcribing, graphing and mental imaging. What is being represented remains as ob- scure as the question what music itself represents. Musicologists have long believed that transcriptions were a key to representing, analyzing and understanding music, in particular "other" music. Over the past decades computer imaging of music has taken a leap forward, showing that transcription is a very complex process of translation that not only crosses cultural but also sensory borders. • Nicolas Magriel: "Visualizing North Indian Music: Looking at Khyâl Songs," 1 19-36. Abstract ü. Short songs in dialects of Hindi are the basis for improvisation in khyâl, the principal genre of contemporary North Indian classical vocal music. Khyâl songs are not defined by written represen- tations, but are transmitted orally, committed to memory and re-created through performance. During the twentieth century several collections of khyâl songs were published for pedagogical and archival</page><page sequence="48">66 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) purposes. This development was largely catalyzed by the Independence movement and the widespread perception of a need to reclaim and consolidate India's cultural identity. Songs which had been the closely guarded property of hereditary musicians were brought into the public domain. The written word and graphic representation gave a stamp of alleged authenticity to song compositions, despite their often being carelessly transcribed, shifting the locus of musical authority. Literate Hindu musi- cians have largely replaced the hereditary, predominantly Muslim, musicians who were the custodians of Hindustani music for centuries. Together with the linguist and Hindi scholar Laiita du Perron, the author is currently working on an Arts and Humanities Research Board-funded project, transcribing and analyzing some four-hundred khvàl songs culled from classic gramophone recordings from the period 1903-75. The present paper looks at some of the cultural history of transcription in North India, and addresses some of the musical issues arising from this ongoing effort to accurately and accessibly transcribe khyâl songs. • Frank Kouwenhoven: "Transcribing Time' in Chinese Non-measured Songs," 137-62. Abstract : Music transcriptions in ethnomusicology become more and more "conceptual:" we stress schemata, recurring patterns and overall similarities in musical structures; we reduce complexities in notation, and try to connect the remaining simplified forms meaningfully with native or Western musi- cal concepts and theories. In doing so, we may dismiss many surface details that are perhaps equally (if not more) instructive. A related problem is that transcriptions are too often regarded as "end products," not as mere snapshots of dynamic and multi-faceted processes. A different picture arises if surface con- tours of musical pieces are screened in more detail, and over longer periods of time. The present article argues these points with reference to analyses of time organization in Chinese non-measured songs. Book Reviews (Tina K. Ramnarine, ed.) • Daniel Avorgbedor: "Charry, Eric.

Abstract : This article introduces a redefinition of texts and musical repertoires employed by contem- porary choirs in post-independence Tanzania (East Africa). The case studies present everyday sound- scapes, suggesting an ongoing cultural and religious exchange that has long thrived within various forms of African Christianity. Tanzanian kwayas (KiSwahili, "choirs") provide the article's primary source for what Steven Kaplan refers to as indigenous responses to Western Christianity. A primary focus of the article is on the everyday performances of kwaya communities as they confront religious discontent and alienation, and openly question authority of church governance. In addition, the ar- ticle addresses dichotomous constructions - Western vs. African, indigenous vs. non-indigenous, old vs. new, evangelical vs. mainstream - suggesting that within such relationships there is a denial of a kwaya' s contributions to everyday spirituality and a lack of understanding of the development, change, and adaptation experienced by many musical traditions within African contexts. • Carol Muller: "'Reading'the Book, Performing the Words of Izihlabelelo zamaNazaretha , 31-64. Abstract. In this paper I examine izihlabelelo zamaNazaretha , the collection of liturgy, prayers, and spiritual songs composed by South African prophet-healer Isaiah Shembe and his son, Galilee, in Kwa- Zulu Natal in the early twentieth century. The hymns exist in the community in both written and orally transmitted forms allowing for a certain tension between the two modes of transmission. I argue that this tension reflects on the nature of belief as the verbal versus written utterance: between the "Word of God" as carried by the human voice and experienced within the bounds of the body and the objecti- fied "Word" of the scriptural economy that stressed belief divorced from the body. I write a parallel narrative to my earlier work ( 1 999a), which stressed issues of political economy, musical performance, and ritual practice, to focus on the largely American Christian mission context in which Isaiah Shembe operated in the early twentieth century. • Anne K. Rasmussen: "The Arab Musical Aesthetic in Indonesian Islam," 65-89. Abstract : Islamic musical arts in Indonesia both reflect and project contemporary identity politics in the world's most populous Muslim country. The recited Qur'an is the major vehicle for Arab musical aesthetics in Indonesia. Related to this very musical, ritual performance a range of Indonesian sacred musics may be identified including Arabic-language tawashih, a popular Islamic Malay song genre, the qasidah, the Western-influenced akapela, and gamelan dakwah. As Indonesia negotiates its way through the process of democratic reform and development (pembagunan ), expressions of religious and cultural identity, whether global or local, traditional or modern are played out and performed through Islamic musical arts, or, what Indonesians refer to as "seni musik Islam." vol 47, 2005 (1)</page><page sequence="50">68 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • T.M. Scruggs: "(Re)Indigenization?: Post- Vatican II Catholic Ritual and 'Folk Masses' in Nicaragua," 91-123. Abstract This article considers the move to reconstitute the Catholic mass after the mid-1960s with the use of vernacular expression, i.e., local language and music. The concept of "indigenizing" Christian- ity is critiqued within a context where adherence to the religion is long-standing but the cultural expres- sion is reworked to "re-indigenize" the liturgy. I suggest that the turn to the vernacular within the mass, the most stylistically conservative part of Catholic worship, divides into two types: "translation" and "socially committed" masses. I analyze the two masses created in Nicaragua to illustrate the historical trajectory of post- Vatican II masses in Latin America and the problematic of "indigenizing" Catholic ritual within already established parameters of Christian worship. The article locates these masses in relation to others in Latin America to consider imperatives of regionalism and nationalism, and their relation to the process of indigenization with later global circulation. • Zoe Sherinian: "The Indigenization of Tamil Christian Music: Musical Style and Liberation Theology," 125-65. Abstract'. Historical and ethnographic analysis of the cultural exchange of religion in the context of colonialism reveals that local indigenizers have agency and the adoptive process cannot simply be attributed to cultural imposition that resulted in the destruction of the indigenous culture. Moreover, generations after adoption in the post-colonial period, it has been observed that oppressed groups can continue to re-indigenize or reform the adopted religion by drawing on local liberating cultural forms that continue to make it contextually meaningful.

Abstract The idea was to focus on developing a volume concerning women in music and music- related fields in Sri Lanka and not only to publish writings on the topic of women in music and music- related fields, but also, at the same time, to create a volume entirely of the work of female authors: either artists or academic researchers. • Martina Claus-Bachmann: "Kuveni, or the Curse of a Woman as Flash Point for Music- oriented (Re)Constructions," 15-36. Abstract : Sadness, tears and a reviled woman's curse are the flash point for this article, which focuses on Kuveni, the legendary foremother of the Sinhalese and the Veddha minority of Sri Lanka. She is an iridescent outline: due to a lack of historically provable evidence, she can be reborn and reconstructed according to the needs and spirit of the time, or of the individual artist of a drama, dance, music, or combined performance of all these together. The article follows a musical line of Kuveni reconstruc- tions, beginning with Kuveni Asne, an orally-transmitted part of the protection ritual Kohomba Kan- kariya. The article also examines a continuation of the Kuveni motif in a postcolonial music drama by distinguished author and actor Henry Jayasena and his composers Mr. Bandara and Lylie Godridge, and engages with a composition and re-interpretation of the story by award-winning composer Diliup Gabadamudalige in a world music context. In addition to making musical observations, the article also illuminates aspects of gender in its examination of facets of the flash point figure Kuveni, and also by reflecting on the contemporary independence of women in the socially critical lyrics of a song by Carlo Fonseka. • Mangalika Rajapakse: "Songs Associated with Sri Lanka's Paddy Cultivation: Music and Gender Aspects," 37^48.

The article also focuses on the roles of women in the paddy cultivation process. • Almut Jayaweera: "Vannama: A Classical Dance Form and its Musical Structure," 49- 64. Abstract : This article examines an example of a classical dance form called vannama , with particular focus on its musical structure. Through this example, the richness of Sinhalese percussion music is also examined. The Sinhalese culture in Sri Lanka has developed a rich, locally diverse and highly developed drumming tradition, which we can trace to the fifth century B. C. Drums are the main instru- ments played in traditional healing rituals and Buddhist ceremonies, as well as in performances on the modern dance stages today. Here drumming is mostly connected to dance; it transmits powerful en- ergy to the dancers, and unfolds in precise and differentiated rhythmical structures, which the dancers translate into steps and movements. Through the centuries, drums were played only by men, and the dance masters ( gurunanseje ), who pass the ability and knowledge of dance and drumming to the next generation, have also been male. But in recent decades, more and more female dancers have taken to the public stage, and also more women (considerably more than men) have studied dance and drum- ming in order to become dance teachers for public and private schools. To do that, of course, they must at least learn to musically accompany their own dance classes, and for that reason there is an increasing number of women who are drumming. All, including students from foreign countries - as the author has been for five years - must study and rehearse the canonical repertory, of which the vannamas are an important part. • Waidyawathie Rajapakse: "On the Origin of Sri Lankan Dancing: Between Spirit Beliefs and Great Tradition, Appeasement of the Gods, and Healing Methods," 65-78. Abstract : The purpose of this article is to reconstruct the legendary and historically discoverable pre- conditions of the forms of Sri Lankan dances. Though a number of books exist in Sinhala language concerning dance, information in English and other western languages is still scarce. This article seeks to address some of the questions that remain open, mainly those concerning the nature of the fusion of Buddhist, pre-Buddhist, or non-Buddhist forms of expression in Sri Lankan dancing. The study is focused mainly on the dances of the Sinhalese ethnic group which is the most populous group on the island. • Marianne Nürnberger: "Vajira: The First Professional Female Stage Dancer in the Sinhalese Style," 79-100. Abstract : This article analyzes the historical role of Vajira, the first professional female dancer of the Sinhalese style, analyzed according to her influence on the culture of Sri Lanka. Her life-work played a decisive role not only for the development of female stage dance, but also for the more recent move- ments of Sinhalese female ritualists. Here, Vajira's extraordinary career is described, and her most important ballets, tours, and awards are named. The article outlines some examples of her numerous contributions to modern dance training in some detail, and highlights her pedagogical role in the devel- opment of children's dance training techniques and children's ballet. Finally, it briefly presents Vajira's newest project for the preservation of traditional Sinhalese male up-country dance. • Sabine Grosser: "Changing Worlds: Music, Women, and Fine Arts in Postcolonial Sri Lanka: A Critical Reading of Four Sri Lankan Art Works with Female Authors Relating to the World of Music," 101-19. Abstract : In this article I outline shifting artistic concepts of culture and cultural symbols in Sri Lanka. I examine four easel paintings that relate to the world of music, painted by four female Sri Lankan art- ists. Taking these examinations as a starting point, I suggest various readings that reflect the social de- velopments and cultural discourses of the island's post-colonial era. These readings have implications for our understanding of Sri Lankan culture, artistic expression, gender, and the shifting meanings of musical instruments, symbols, and concepts.</page><page sequence="53">2.

Abstract : Worldwide, contemporary polities conveniently pay lip service to women's rights and related issues while dismissing or concealing covert forms of social control that limit their social freedom at grassroots levels. Irreconcilable, despite its outward legislation of female rights, is Sri Lanka's subver- sive control and ownership of its female populous. Thus, compliance with socially determined codes of behavior, referenced by a complicated blending of European colonial and indigenous cultures, earn Sri Lankan women membership within the respectable "chaste/virtuous" category whilst deviation, such as a choice to pursue a profession in music entertainment, merits disrespect and branding into the "im- pure/corrupt" social category. Hence negotiating freedom and commanding respect within this rigidly debilitating framework burdens many Sri Lankan women in chorus baila and Sinhala pop music. Book Reviews (Tina K.

Abstract : The term "Japanese Music" ( hõgaku or Nihon ongaku ) is today used both in and out of Japan to refer to what is usually treated as a body of music with definable and unique characteristics. These attributes, in turn, are generally thought to relate closely to geographical, psychological, spiritual, or other supra-historical traits of the Japanese land and people. This paper seeks to trace the emergence and growth of the idea of "Japanese music" and to demonstrate that the rise of this concept has de- pended not on eternal structures or immutable "core values" but rather on the specific historical devel- opment of Japanese economics, politics, and culture. It is this historical process that has provided both the conditions and the motivating force for the concept of "Japanese music" to appear and to develop into what it has today become. • Patrick Halliwell: "Groupism and Individualism in Japanese Traditional Music," 35^6. Abstract : This article considers Japanese traditional music, with emphasis on the world of koto music, in terms of the broad social themes of groupism and individualism. A distinction is made between the social organization of music-making and the act of music-making. It is shown that the former, through the ryûha-iemoîo systems, is dominated by groupism; specific incidents illustrate a strong degree of social control over musical activity (learning and performance) extending even to stylistic detail. This is a hierarchical form of groupism, in which the greatest benefits (musical freedom, recognition, power, and money) are for those at the top. The act of music-making, on the other hand, offers opportunities for individualism. The benkyô-kai ("study concert") illustrates a growing degree of freedom and indi- viduality with musical accomplishment and experience. In addition, there are structural features in the genres of jiuta-sôkyoku (instrumental timbre, idiomatic techniques of sound-production, and a com- positional technique of rhythmic/melodic offsetting) which contribute to the identity and importance of each musical part, and therefore make this a very individualistic music, even within the stylistic restraints of groupism. • Terence Lancashire: "The Kagura Dance: Variation and the Problem of Representation in Iwami Kagura ," 47-78 Abstract : Japanese folk performing arts are regional and are often identified by the place names of the areas in which they are located. Regional titles give the impression of a united tradition but on closer examination variation is observable between different exponents of the same tradition. This paper examines the kagura dance - a ritual shrine entertainment - of the Iwami area in western Shimane prefecture as performed by two kagura performing groups within the same transmission lineage. It re- veals a remarkable degree of variation in the interpretation of kagura dances, making identification of the Iwami tradition on a regional basis problematic. In terms of transmission of the dance, it is perhaps more appropriate to speak of tradition at the level of each performing group. • Henry Johnson: "To and From an Island Periphery: Tradition, Travel, and Transforming Identity in the Music of Ogasawara, Japan," 79-98. Abstract : This is a study of tradition, travel and transforming identity in the music of one of Japan's most southerly island groups, Ogasawara (also known as the Bonin Islands). Japan has several periph- eral regions, and in the southwest - about 1,000 km from the mainland (i.e., Honshû - is Ogasawara. These small islands, which have a population of about 2,500, have a relatively recent social history of around two hundred years, and, unlike most other Japanese regions, have a definite geographic and cultural context in the Pacific wfth much non-Japanese contact and settlement. Indeed, it is the eclec- tic mix of peoples, together with Ogasawara's place as a Japanese geographic and cultural periphery, which has been foregrounded in recent years in the islands' traditional music - both by islanders and other Japanese. Moreover, this music has not only occupied a position that has been negotiated in Oga- sawara's search for its own contemporary cultural identity, but has also been transformed in a national representation by several popular music performers and groups, and then re-established and re-negoti- ated in the islands' present-day perception of its traditional and quite recent past.</page><page sequence="56">74 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) With several unique music genres that are quite different from others in Japan, the folk music of Oga- sawara has captured the attention of several mainland Japanese popular musicians. While the islands' music has a small position in an immense Japanese music industry, what is particularly significant for the music researcher of place and identity are the interconnections, travel, and transformation of the music. That is, the mainland musicians have reproduced songs, which themselves have only a recent history on Ogasawara, and these have subsequently become popular for locals and tourists alike - about 30,000 tourists visit each year. It is these complex roots/routes that are explored in this article. The study looks at the ways the same music is transformed through travel for different reasons, and how an examination of borrowing, invention and transformation can help in understanding not only the place of so-called traditional music in one of Japan's peripheries today, but also how and why that place is imagined and consumed in parts of Japan that are politically very close, albeit geographically, and sometimes culturally quite distant. • Jane Alaszewska: "Edo Traditions on the 'Islands of Exile:' The Narrative Ballads of the Southern Izu Islands," 99-121. Abstract: Kudoki bushi are long narratives with dramatic plots sung to simple, strophic melodies. The genre flourished in the Edo period, performed by itinerant musicians and by local communities at the bon ancestral festival. By the late nineteenth century audiences grew tired of lengthy kudoki and the genre was eclipsed by shorter, livelier repertories. It was to my surprise that I encountered a pocket of Japan where the art of kudoki is still alive. In Aogashima, a tiny community of Pacific islanders on the edge of Tokyo Prefecture, this popular entertainment of the Edo period has been transformed into a central part of the local repertory. Focusing on kudoki , this paper explores the diffusion of mainland repertories to the Southern Izu is- lands and their assimilation into island culture. It examines kudoki performance on neighboring islands in the twentieth century, exploring divergence in the tradition as one island embraces tourism and the other retains its traditional isolation. It concludes with a look at recent attempts to revive this perfor- mance at the heart of the community. • Barbara E. Thornbury: "Cultural Policy and Private Initiative: The Performing Arts at The Japan Society, New York," 123-36. Abstract : Since its establishment in 1907, the Japan Society, New York, has developed into one of the most influential cultural organizations in the world in the areas of Japanese drama, dance, and music. The influential position that the Society has attained in the performing arts is built on a set of strategic relationships in five sectors: creative personnel; academic - as well as non-academic - specialists in the performing arts and Japanese culture; arts administrators; funding agencies; and individual audi- ence members represented by the newly-formed "Friends of the Performing Arts." Once an exponent of the "traditional" - equal - "authentic" model of Japanese culture, the Japan Society now takes the lead in presenting innovative and experimental work that forthrightly addresses issues of culture, so- ciety, and history. • Gen'ichi Tsuge: "Coercively Standardized or Not: Romanization Systems of the Japanese Language in the Music Literature," 137-43. Abstract Transliteration of the Japanese language in the Latin alphabet has been actively attempted since the mid-nineteenth century. There exist at least three major transliteration systems, not mention- ing some earlier attempts by Portuguese and Dutch. They are the so-called Hepburn system (a system devised by Anglophones) the Nippon system (based on the morphological structure of Japanese) and the kunrei system, a modified version of this latter system. The 1954 cabinet notification concerning Romanization recommends use of the kunrei system as a general rule, while at the same time allowing recourse to the Hepburn system and Nippon systems "under certain circumstances." As a result, the current coexistence of all three systems leads to some confusion. Although adoption of a unified system would make life easier, this is unlikely to happen in the near future. However, the increasingly widespread use of English has given the Hepburn system advantage over its rivals.

Abstract : "England - Last undiscovered exotic outpost of World Music" - this headline, together with the colorful costumes of the Bacup Britannia Coconut Dancers from Lancashire decorated the title page of the British folk/world music magazine Folk Roots in April 1997. In his article, "This is Eng- land," music journalist Colin Irwin went to explore the still living traditions, such as the celebration of May Day in the streets of Padstow (Cornwall) and dance performances of old-established teams like the Bampton Morris Dancers, the Abbots Bromley Horn Dancers in Staffordshire, and the above- mentioned Britannia Coconut Dancers. The latter - with their blackened faces, white skirts with red hoops, and white, feather-decorated hats - are the only, yet carefully cultivated, remnants of a tradition performed on Easter Day in the small Lancashire town of Bacup. As Irwin explained, almost apologeti- cally, the London-based magazine has been covering music traditions from all over the world, with the exception of his native region, England, despite its apparent richness of local music traditions. Folk Roots' s sensational headline might be exaggerated, but Irwin's plain observation can neverthe- less be transferred to the academic world of ethnomusicology as well. This volume thus investigates into a much neglected area of contemporary British music traditions (essentially all those that might be described as "non-Celtic"). At the same time, the articles also highlight a few of the many facets of the expression of identity in British music. The topics range from vernacular traditions in England and the articulation of British (political) identity in Northern Ireland to the music of Caribbean immigrant cultures and the general interaction of eastern (here Punjabi) traditions and western popular music in Britain. • Ian Russel: "Sacred and Secular: Identity, Style, and Performance in Two Singing Traditions from the Pennies," 1 1-40. Abstract Although English folksong scholarship led the field in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and helped to shape the modern conception of folk music, its voice in international research has largely disappeared. Arguably the narrow time-locked definition of folk song expounded by Cecil Sharp and largely adopted by his contemporaries, which was subsequently reiterated with ideological fervor by his followers, contributed to this decline. I would suggest that the mindset engendered by his key position statements precluded a dynamic inclusive understanding of vernacular English musical traditions and their subsequent development. In this paper I aim to compare two singing traditions which Sharp chose to exclude from his rubric; these traditions have not merely continued but flourished throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. Through the discussion, which focuses on their contemporary practice, the tensions of their differing world views will be explored as a contribution towards an understanding of the com- plexity of English musical identity. • Jonathan P.J.

Contents and Abstracts • 77 Abstract : English musicians speak of sessions as events of an essentially egalitarian character. While expertise is celebrated within the English tradition, sessions are viewed ideally as meeting places for the like-minded, not sites for musical domination or personal display. This case study of instrumental music making at the Wednesday night sessions of the Red House public house, Sheffield, draws per- spectives from the ethnomusicological literature on leadership in performance. After introducing the repertory and performance style of sessions, the article gives an ethnographic account of the interplay of musical authority on several levels: deference is made to particular individuals; shared experience (among regular players) of the session's customary framework provides further order; and players' musical decisions direct yet further interactions. A well-ordered performance is finally a multi-level experience that turns as much on matters of musical prestige, authority and expertise as the publicly stated notions of fellowship and equality. • Katy Radford: "Red, White, Blue, and Orange: An Exploration of Historically Bound Allegiances through Loyalist Song," 71-89. Abstract : In this article, I consider the historical processes behind an aspect of music making by staunch loyalists in Northern Ireland. The intention is to demonstrate how the Protestant sacrifice and contribution to battles and skirmishes, from the Williamite Wars to the Somme, is reflected in a canon of Orange songs. A continued exposure to this material determines and restricts what members of loy- alist communities regard as their principal musical heritage. I suggest that by engaging predominantly with this mode of music making, Ulster/Northern Ireland Protestants/unionists define and capture an essential aspect of the loyalist experience, which is an allegiance to a United Kingdom embodied and personified by her Sovereign and steeped in historically based coalitions of patronage. • Tina K. Ramnarine: "Imperial Legacies and the Politics of Musical Creativity," 91-108. Abstract : Musical performances and discourses on music have provided some of the most prominent public forums for debates centered on the politics of empire, race and nation. Caribbean communities in a postcolonial Britain have contributed to pushing against the borders of the "national" through their musical practices. Of particular interest is the way in which calypsonians have begun to describe their practice as "British folk music." This description raises a series of questions concerning the borders of Britishness/Englishness, which will be explored in this article. While "British folk music" emphasizes location, are its new performance spaces, like the Royal Opera House and the Victoria and Albert Mu- seum, signs that Caribbean musics have found a place in the national imagination. • Laura Leante: "Shaping Diasporic Sounds: Identity as Meaning in Bhangra ," 109-32. Abstract Bhangra originated in India as a male folk dance performed in the villages of Punjab dur- ing the harvest festivities. Following the migrations of Punjabis to Britain, a new form of bhangra , characterized by the encounter between the traditional dance and mainstream Anglo-American popular music, spread through the communities of the Indian diaspora, coming to constitute one of the means for immigrants both to identify themselves as "Punjabis in England" and to reaffirm their tradition and social values. This paper investigates the musical processes through which British bhangra is shaped, the grounds on which the appropriation of mainstream pop takes place and how bhangra contributes to the construction of diasporic identity.

This is an important rhetorical question, which may well serve a pragmatisti other questions. Much of today's discourse on music and its non-sonic significations are buried in obfuscation and neologism, thus blurring further any possibilities of knowing about music of our "own" and that of "others." Too bad, we can never know ourselves well enough; and too good, we can always safely talk about "others." This issue devoted to cross-cultural aesthetics represents an effort to create an additional dialectical space for clarifying the substance of and notions about musical practices, worldwide. There is no intention to limit what, which, when, how, where, who , and why of any particular musical tradition. • Lawrence Kramer: "Music, Cultural Mixture, and the Aesthetic," 1 1-22. vol. 45, 2003 (3)</page><page sequence="61">2. Contents and Abstracts • 79 Abstract : Purity, the positive experience of mixture as a prohibited or impossible absence, is the dis- tinctive property of the aesthetic qua aesthetic in that, no matter how heterogeneous the work of art may be, the aesthetic, whether in the work or the perceiver, unifies and synthesizes. This capacity for syn- thesis has most commonly been theorized for the single-medium artwork, but in practice it traditionally extends into the more problematic arena of mixed media. The aesthetic becomes genuinely liberatory only when it becomes impure, which is to say, more or less than the aesthetic - where, one might say, a windowless monad becomes a hermeneutic window. The danger of the aesthetic is not that its purity will turn us all into lotus-eaters, but that we may mistake the aesthetic formulation of our obligations and commandments for their uncontestable truth rather than the very form of their contestation. Since music has notorious magpie tendencies, snapping up stylistic valuables wherever they may be found, this process of mixture and refinement has become a basic strategy for regulating the impulse to cross- cultural boundaries. • Ian Chambers: "Some Notes on Neapolitan Song: From Local Tradition to Worldly Transit," 23-27. Abstract : The history of a place can be seen as an archive of sound, a collection of musical accents and accidents, an accumulation of historical notes, an orchestration of cultural traces. If sounds historically emerge from certain places, they are nevertheless destined to travel in a manner that easily exceeds the boundaries imposed by local identities and national boundaries. Yet localities inscribed in sound do stick out, and sometimes remain seemingly untranslatable, as shown in the Neapolitan song. Tradi- tions, in whatever language they are expressed, are invariably lived as though homogeneous, without contradictions. To suggest otherwise is to contest their authority. If we know that historically all tradi- tions are in debt to others, to the strangers and foreigners they are designed to exclude, this is not what tradition desires to tell us. Yet if tradition draws its power from narcissism, it can only survive, live on, by borrowing from the other, by reproducing itself through encounters that are not of its own making. Almamegretta's first release in 1994, "Figli di Annibale/Hannibal's Children," clarifies a grammar of hybridity, while their "sound" remains readily locatable. • Judith Lynne Hanna: "Aesthetics - Whose Notions of Appropriateness and Competency, What Are They and What Do We Know?," 29-55. Abstract : Because of the diversity of dance, there are various aesthetic criteria - notions of appropri- ateness, competency and excellence-based on individual experience, knowledge, and cultural back- ground. This article considers two fieldwork experiences, (1) a Minnesota, U.S., adult entertainment nude exotic dance case in which aesthetic judgment had criminal consequences and (2) a way of learn- ing the Kuchipudi classical Indian dance without visiting India, to raise the following questions: What are a group's aesthetics? How do we find out? Subsequent passages examine some people's cherished dance aesthetic markers to suggest the array of criteria, such as elements of content, choreography, technique, efficacy, change, hybrid dances, and stylistic schools, even within highly codified genres like classical ballet. Final thoughts turn to the problems of conducting research to discover a group's aesthetics. Approximation can occur taking these problems into account plus sensuous epistemologies, a corporeal mode of knowing, and mind/body integration of cognition, feeling, and emotion that con- stitute realities for both performers and perceivers. • Marc Benamou: "Comparing Musical Affect: Java and the West," 57-76. Abstract : Comparison across traditions obscures intracultural variation as well as the many mutual influences between cultures - that is, it ignores the heterogeneity found within cultures and the per- meability of cultural boundaries. The goal of increasing cross-cultural understanding remains one of ethnomusicology's principal raisons d'être, despite recent critiques of the practice of multiculturalism and of the concept of culture. There are three principal ways we can know what people feel when they listen to music: introspection, observation, and the language used by insiders to describe their musical experience. All of these contribute to an understanding of emotion and music, but they each have their problems. What we feel when we listen to music is very much influenced by words we have heard or overheard; even self-deceptive clichés enter into our musical education and become a part of our expe-</page><page sequence="62">80 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) riential reality. The internal structure and connotations of Javanese and Western categories differ, but there are musical features that have the same affective meaning in these two cultures, especially in the areas of tessitura and rhythmic density. • Benjamin D. Koen: "The Spiritual Aesthetic in Badakhshani Devotional Music," 77-90. Abstract : This article explores the sounds, symbols, and metaphors at the center of the maddâh aes- thetic. The ritual performance of Badakhshani devotional music relies on the creation and maintenance of a spiritual sound ideal, which resides at the nexus of performance. Maddâh is the preeminent genre of devotional music among the Isma'ilis of Tajik Badakhshan. Symbols and metaphors from the genre, local religious belief and cosmology, as well as the natural and built environments, interact to create the spiritual aesthetic necessary to achieve the goals of maddâh. Performers and listeners aim to em- body the meaning inherent in maddâh , and to carry the spiritual aesthetic from the performative, sacred space of the maddâhkhane into daily activities. • Chan E. Park: "Poetics and Politics of Korean Oral Tradition in a Cross-cultural Context," 91-103. Abstract : A discussion of cross-cultural aesthetics is instantly embedded in the discussion of geopoliti- cal strategies of cultural hybridization. All forms of contemporary music in the world have intercultural roots, and the traffic of influence can be metaphorically referred to as the flow of water from high to low position, from center to margin, and vice versa. Korea adopted as her main intercultural partner Western music, ranging from classical to gospel, folk, pop, ballad, jazz, rock, blues, and rap. P'ansori is a story-singing art that emerged from the repertoire of the outcast kwangdae singers during the mid- Choson era and evolved into Korea's Intangible Cultural Asset No. 5 in the twentieth century - it is an intriguing matrix of societal and aesthetic crossings, contradictions, engagements, disengagements, tale, and telling. Every cross-cultural act breaks new ground, forging a new connection, a new hybrid- ity, a new aesthetics, and it would be presumptuous to define cross-cultural aesthetics in fixed terms. My performance of the Tale of Hungbo, a cross-cultural p 'ansori narrating the travails and triumphs of the Korean- American journey, sums up the key issues linking hybridity and cross-cultural aesthetics. • Cheryl L. Keyes: "The Aesthetic Significance of African American Sound Culture and Its Impact on Popular Music Style and Industry," 105-29. Abstract : African American sound preferences emphasize timbres and concepts that also have roots in African performance practices, and as shown in contemporary approaches to sound and rhythm in rap. New technologies continue to shape the "aesthetic" in African American sound culture, which is informed also by the global market primarily through intercultural and intracultural borrowing. Black cultural productions overwhelmingly contributed to the making of American popular culture, from the minstrel stage to its appropriation by Tin Pan Alley songwriters. Blues was the dominant musical genre of the "race" music industry of the 1920s, and the boogie-woogie piano style represented the com- mercialization of an instrumental form of blues; it provided the musical basis for "jump blues bands." Chicago blues guitarists experimented with distortions and feedback sounds, which laid the roots for the 1 960s "psychedelic" rock scene. The transistor radio and the expansion of the recording industry provided the stimuli for the mass commodification of black popular music forms. Book Reviews (Tina K.

Abstract : Research on encounters between traditional non- Western music and contemporary composi- tional practice tends to neglect detailed musical analysis in favor of extensive socio-cultural or political theoretical frameworks. This article is an attempt to link these two diverse branches of musical scholar- ship. At first, two examples of cross-cultural musical appropriations point at the "bouncing" quality of musical intercultural ity: repercussions of a Drinking Song of the Taiwanese aborigines Ami and of the Chinese melody Molihua ("Jasmine Flower") suggest that "authenticity" in a strict sense has until the present often played a minor role in musical creation or daily musical practice.

The tension between nearness and distance to traditional and contemporary idioms and the challenge to find a balance between identifica- tion and criticism towards a cultural "Self' and a cultural "Other" are crucial aspects of compositional practice for some composers in Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan. Musical works by Koo Bonu, Kim Eun-Hye, Kim Jin-Hi, Guo Wenjing, Chen Xiaoyong, Hsu Po-Yun and Takahashi Yüji successfully re- flect on essential ized concepts of culture and thus arguably can represent substantial counter-discourses to the globally dominating system of Western music - a main criterion for the definition of a contem- porary East Asian "avant garde." • Franki S. Notosudirdjo: "Kyai Kanjeng: Islam and the Search for National Music in Indonesia," 39-52. Abstract : The article addresses the problems of national identity embedded in the musical world of the culturally diverse, developing country of Indonesia. Following the creation of Kinanthie Sandoong (1916), a piece of art music by composer and prominent nationalist leader Ki Hadjar Dewantara, the history of twentieth-century Indonesian music from the colonial era up to the present has been perme- ated with the dynamic search for a national music. With the introduction of Soeharto's New Order period in the mid-1960s, the effort to seek Indonesian national music entered a new phase of aesthetic and ideological complexity. This was especially true after the revival of Islamic culture in the late pe- riod of the New Order (1990s). In their endeavor to seek a new model of modernity based on Islamic religious values, Muslim composers came up with works that uniquely combined Western aesthetics and technology with Islamic elements. By the same token, I would argue that their music strongly re-addressed the issue of national music in Indonesia. One of the most significant endeavors to intro- duce Islamic contemporary music as a form of national music can be discerned in the music of Kyai Kanjeng , a group of experimental gamelan musicians founded by Emha Ainun Najib (b. 1953), a poet- singer, essayist and informal Muslim leader, and Djaduk Ferianto, a prominent self-taught composer with a Javanese traditional music background. I argue that the existence of Kyai Kanjeng in its capacity to achieve a synthesis between Eastern and Western music traditions is very significant for the develop- ment of a genuine art music in Indonesia. • Barbara Mittler: "Cultural Revolution Model Works and the Politics of Modernization in China: An Analysis of Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy 53-81 . Abstract The so-called model works {yangbanxi ), ten operas, four ballets, two symphonies and two piano pieces monopolized China's theatrical and musical stages for a decade. No matter whether one follows the now orthodox political interpretation contending that they were products of the ultra-leftist mind of Mao's wife Jiang Qing or whether one considers them worthy pieces of art, they are an element in Chinese cultural history that cannot be - but (for ideological reasons) often is - overlooked. Reper- cussions of the model works can be traced in China's recent rock music, in light popular music as well as in her serious music. Contrary to the common assumption that the model works were characteristic products of Cultural Revolution ideology, this paper contends that they were anything but the product of an iconoclastic and xenophobic era, as the Cultural Revolution is so often described. Instead, they are manifestations of a hybrid taste which calls for the transformation of Chinese tradition according to foreign standards, a taste which for more than a century has determined compositional practice in China. The paper takes one of the earliest and most well-known model works, the revolutionary Bei- jing opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy , as an example. It examines the use of traditional Chinese as well as European musico-dramatic elements in this piece in order to illustrate that the particular forms musical modernization took during the Cultural Revolution were in no way the exception but more of the rule for compositional practice in modern China - except for the degree of semantic over- determination to be found in the model works. • Stephen Andrew Taylor: "Ligeti, Africa and Polyrhythm," 83-94.</page><page sequence="65">2. Contents and Abstracts • 83 Abstract : Since the 1980s György Ligeti has often spoken of his admiration for African music, even contributing the foreword for Simha Arom's African Polyphony and Polyrhythm. This essay will trace some of the African connections in Ligeti's music of the past twenty years, including the Piano Etudes, Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto and Nonsense Madrigals. These connections are not apparent to the casual listener; in fact, Ligeti seems to take pains to "cover his tracks," to use abstract principles rather than surface details. Furthermore, Ligeti combines these African principles with many other influences and ideas to produce a music which is uniquely his. The article concludes by examining this "integra- tion" of the "Other" (not only African music but all sorts of music and ideas) into Ligeti's idiosyncratic style. • Ashok D. Ranade: "Traditional Musics and Composition in the Indian Context," 95-1 12. Abstract Discussion of composition, compositional processes and genre are intertwined. In the Indian context this discussion needs to take place in perspectives provided by six categories of cultural/musi- cal expression namely, primitive, folk, religious, art, popular and fusion or confluence. Each category has its own specific thrusts in matters related to composition and genre. These six categories inevitably overlap because they are constituents of a larger living tradition. Thus India offers a comprehensive conceptual map that seeks to combine composite sensibility, cultural orientation and societal concerns with narrower auditory expression, aesthetic intention and individual inspiration in musical processes. Obviously such a map proves an open invitation to cross-cultural attempts at music creation.

Abstract : This issue of the world of music brings together case studies on the topic of competitive music performance. Whether we care to acknowledge it or not, competitive practice runs through all aspects of our social lives, and musical performance is no exception. To many, however, the words "music competition" conjure up images of grueling Western classical piano matches where future livelihoods and reputations are at stake. It is true that an important aspect of music contests found throughout the globe is the accumulation of cultural capital, where prestige, honor, revenge, and enter- tainment value are the true prizes. Nevertheless, scholars who work in areas where competition is a part vol. 45, 2003 (1)</page><page sequence="67">2.

Abstract : The author discusses how organized competitions during Trinidad carnival have been used to control aesthetic expression and public behavior, and how these attempts at control are balanced by the creative impulses of participants. While today's competitions-like Calypso Monarch, Panorama (steelband), and Best Band (masquerade) can be explained in terms of such colonial or nationalist at- tempts to establish cultural hegemony; they are also characterized by artistic creativity, festivity, and resistance to authority. Examples of competition in Trinidad carnival during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are presented, as well as corroborating examples from other cultures, in order to delineate patterns of rivalry and competition that can be distinguished from colonial and nationalist politics. • Gavin Douglas: "The Sokayeti Performing Arts Competition of Burma/Myanmar: Performing the Nation," 35-54. Abstract In the years since 1993 the ruling military regime has progressively increased the amount of funding and media attention given to the traditional musical arts of Burma (Myanmar). Included in these efforts is the recent creation of an annual Sokayeti (singing, dancing, composing and performing) music competition. This annual competition runs for two-and-a-half weeks, is held in four of Yangon 's (Rangoon's) biggest venues and draws thousands of contestants and hundreds of judges from through- out the country. In addition, the competition is aggressively documented in the daily news media and is patronized daily by top members of the ruling junta. This competition serves multiple yet contradic- tory ends in its officially designated role of uplifting national prestige and integrity and preserving and safeguarding of cultural heritage and national character. This article examines the annual competition in light of the national unity agenda of the present dictatorship. It will be shown that the competition serves primarily as a vehicle for political legitimation of the present government and in so doing, si- multaneously renders significant changes to the very traditions that they attempt to preserve. • Rebecca S. Miller: " 'Me Ain 'Lie on Nobody ! ' Locality, Regionalism, and Identity at the Parang String Band Competition in Carri acou, Grenada," 55-77. Abstract Produced annually on the small Caribbean island of Carriacou, the Parang Festival show- cases traditional local music, song, and dance-forms that have been recontextualized from commu- nity based genres to staged competition performances. The climax of the festival is the string band competition, an event that reflects ongoing concerns of cultural affiliation as Carriacouans negotiate a post-colonial identity in an increasingly global world. As competing string bands combine local performance practices with regional, Hispanic-Caribbean musical styles, a tension is created around issues of authenticity and self-representation. Yet, this juxtaposition also serves as a creative statement regarding the compatibility of cultural autonomy and a move by Carriacouans towards regional affili- ation and solidarity. • Sean Williams: "Competing Against 'Tradition' in the Sundanese Performing Arts," 79-95. Abstract Since the 1960s, competitions have increasingly become a major avenue for the promotion and marketing of Sundanese culture in West Java, Indonesia, as well as for building support for the arts among young people. The chance to participate in a competition is one of the forces that drives new interest in the Sundanese performing arts. At the same time, the problems of standardization and of covert battles over artistic authority within each genre lead to concerns that the arts of the future may be attractive but empty imitations of their (reputedly more "authentic" and "traditional") twentieth- century counterparts. As the notions of what may constitute "tradition" shift along the lines of nation- alist discourse, so competitions follow suit in bending local ideology to conform to national images of past and present.</page><page sequence="68">86 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Sylvia Nannyonga-Tamusuza: "Competitions in School Festivals: A Process of Re- inventing Baakisimba Music and Dance of the Baganda (Uganda)," 97-1 18. Abstract The author discusses how competition is instrumental in the redefinition of baakisimba , a music and dance genre performed in schools, as well as music and dance festivals. School competitions promote innovative approaches to music and dance performances, and form a site for the formation of "new" baakisimba music and dance styles. Since performance exists within a particular social, politi- cal, and cultural structure, competition in performance has implications for social relations. Competi- tions also offer a stage for recreating new meanings of gender through baakisimba performance. • Ramona Holmes: "'It's a Girl Bonding Thing': Softball Set Cheers in the United States," 119-32. Abstract : There are some sports in which musical participation is an important part of team member- ship. This article examines group chants known as "set cheers," which are an integral part of women's softball team participation. Set cheers have common musical characteristics with slight differences based on region and age of players. Form, rhythm, melody and text play important parts in how set cheers build group cohesiveness. Informal oral transmission and composition of set cheers promote identity as athletes and leadership opportunities for women in softball teams. • Chris Goertzen: "Galax, Virginia's 'Old Fiddlers Convention': The Virtues and Flaws of a Giant Fiddle Contest," 133^47. Abstract : The enormous annual "convention" arranged by the Moose Lodge in Galax, Virginia, has long been the largest contest in the Southeast, despite serious flaws. Every year, hundreds of musicians hear each other both on stage and in jam sessions here. But these performers and their fans pack the venue to the bursting point. Festival gigantism is the tendency of attractive events to grow and deterio- rate, eventually reaching a stable overblown size reflecting an uneasy equilibrium between persisting virtues and cumulative unpleasantness. At Galax, minimal administration exacerbates routine annoy- ances attendant on gigantism. Avoidable scheduling problems abound. This and numerous other fac- tors have eroded the ideological stake that participants have in smaller local contests, which benefit a county scholarship fund, a volunteer fire department, etc. Why do so many musicians keep coming to Galax year after year? That they choose to negotiate the inevitable inconveniences of this convention is a vivid and annually reinforced testimony to the values associated with old-time music and bluegrass, namely doing something for yourself, communion with family and friends, and faith that a "better" past can be invoked to shape a healthier present and future. For the musicians who play at Galax, nostalgia is not just a feeling, but an emotional model made concrete on numerous fiddle contest weekends, and served especially well by the block of a full week playing and visiting at Galax. It is not just abstract, vague nostalgia, then, it is a way of life briefly but intensely enacted. Thus, both the usual problems of festival gigantism and the tropes on the drawbacks peculiar to Galax are swept aside by remarkably powerful good feelings.

Contents • Martin Boiko: "Baltic and Baits: On the History of Notions and the Question of Baltic Regionalism," 7-19. Abstract : Since their introduction in the second half of the 19th century both the term "Baltic" (Germ. Baltikum) as the designation of a region and the term "Baits" as designation of its population have experienced several changes of their meanings. The Baltic, a region that comprises Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, is neither under historical and political, nor under linguistic and denominational aspects a coherent area. Since the early 1990s, indications of the geopolitical dissolution of the region have been increasing. A parallel process is the formation of a larger Baltic Sea Region comprising the countries all around the Baltic Sea. The question whether the Baltic is a coherent region in ethnomusicologi- cal terms remains open. However, there is no lack of musical phenomena common to all three Baltic countries. vol. 44, 2002 (3)</page><page sequence="70">88 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Valdis Muktupävels: "Musical Instruments in the Baltic Region: Historiography and Traditions," 21-54. Abstract : The Baltic - a term with conventional rather than rational implications - can be used as a general frame to arrange a multitude of organological facts from historically, linguistically, and de- nominationally different musical cultures - Estonian (EE), Latvian (LV) and Lithuanian (LT). The first part of the article deals with the documentation of instrumental music, as well as the research and sig- nificant publications of the period from the 13th century until the end of the 20th century. Arranged in chronological groups, these publications mark a synchronic regional perspective and outline some sig- nificant steps in the development of organological thought. Basic functional groups of musical instru- ments and music are discussed in the second part. Thus, this article describes the instruments and the music related to the Baltic people's economic (mainly herding) activities, social events and religious practices. Further, it examines musical instruments used for contemplation and dance in their termino- logical, morphological, musical, symbolic, and historical contexts. • Daiva Vyčiniené: "Lithuanian Schwebungsdiaphonie and its South and East European Parallels," 55-77. Abstract : Polyphonic singing with the parts lying very close to each other is a universal feature of early polyphony. Such "close" singing is widespread in diverse parts of the world: the Mediterranean basin, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Nepal, Afghanistan (Nuristan), on some Melanesian, Micronesian and In- donesian islands, Ethiopia, southern Russia, etc. Lithuanian sutartinès also belong to this category of polyphony. While not rejecting the existence of universais in musical perception, comprehension and performance, and thus accepting the idea of convergence, this article attempts to find a common ethno- historical explanation of this phenomenon. It is restricted to Baltic and South and East Slavic material, but also considers instrumental polyphony. • Anu Vissel: "Estonian Herding Songs from the Perspective of Ethnic Relations," 79-105. Abstract : For the peoples living around the Baltic Sea (the Baltic Finns and the Baits) agriculture and cattle breeding have been important already for ages. The Estonian traditional songlore has two prominent groups of working songs: herding songs and harvest songs. The article begins with a short overview of the history of cattle breeding and herding in Estonia. More attention is paid to the struc- ture of herding songs (in a wider sense) and common features in the texts and melodies of Estonians and neighboring peoples. The relations between vocal and instrumental herding music and subtypes of the herding song repertoire of different ethnic groups is determined by the local structure and type of herding, the social position of herders (sex, age, status in the community), the local life style, and cultural traditions. • Arnolds Klotipš: "The Latvian Neo-folklore Movement and the Political Changes of the Late 20th Century," 107-30. Abstract : "Neo-folklore movement" is a term used in Latvia and other Baltic countries - specifically, Estonia and Lithuania - to denote the sharp and extensive rise of interest in folklore traditions during the 1 970s and 80s. The term also describes practical forms of actualizing folklore in daily life and in the expressions of amateur art that have accompanied the spiritual awakening of the people and their fight for the restoration of independence at beginning of the 1 990s. The expressions "folklore" and "folklor- ism" in the neo-folklore movement, attitudes towards the official Soviet ideologized folklorism, as well as social and political motivations and political contexts are reviewed in the article. The international folklore festival Baltica, organized annually in turn in each of the three Baltic States since 1987, is used as an example. The introduction to this article offers a review of the history of collection, research, and dissemination of folklore in Latvia. • Ingrid Rüütel: "Wedding Songs and Ceremonies of the Kihnu Island in Estonia," 131- 51. Abstract : This article concerns wedding traditions and music of the Estonian island, Kihnu, where ancient customs and songs are still living in unbroken tradition. Weddings songs belong to the Baltic-</page><page sequence="71">2. Contents and Abstracts • 89 Finnic runo-song tradition. All wedding songs in Kihnu are of the same one-line tune-type with a nar- row ambit. Their different versions and variants represent the oldest layer of runo-tunes. Weddings songs are treated in a wider ethnocultural context. Focus of attention is performing practices, spells, shouts and instrumental dance music that belong to the wedding ceremony, also spiritual and secular songs of more recent origin and current changes in the wedding tradition. The old Kihnu wedding customs are of pre-Christian origin. Although people have not followed such ancient beliefs for a long time, the symbolic meaning of these customs has been preserved. New songs and customs connected with the Kihnu weddings can be regarded as a compromise between the traditional and the contempo- rary. The whole wonder of the survival of the Kihnu culture actually lies in the fact that in the course of time, it has assimilated different elements that it changed, while maintaining itself. New phenomena and different historical strata have lived side by side, without ousting the old. Today, as traditional folk song and music together with old customs, ethnographic milieu and the traditional way of life are on the verge of disappearing, folklore ensembles have become the principal mediators between traditional and contemporary culture. One such group is Kihnumua, which has been active for more than thirty years representing different generations - the old and the young as well as children. Members of the group were invited to sing at wedding ceremonies, where they usually functioned as ceremonial sing- ers. The last traditional Kihnu wedding was held in 1995 and only time will tell whether the unique Kihnu wedding with its ancient customs and songs will live on or if it will be practiced only as enter- tainment for tourists.

Abstract This issue of the world of music is among the first published anthologies to explore Buddhist music from cross-cultural perspectives. We cultivate a cross-cultural Buddhist musicology - an ethno- musicology of Buddhism - as we undertake focused inquiries into the ways in which Buddhist ritual practitioners around the world use music to guide, signal, and accompany a range of ritual practices related to the physical body of the practitioner, and also movements of the body or representations of bodies (e.g. shadow puppets) performed in conjunction with music. Buddhist musical practices ac- company, inspire, and guide body postures and prostrations, hand gestures, and breathing rhythms, and also aim at guiding prescribed non-movement in some instances, as in disciplines of establishing stillness of the body. In addition, Buddhist ritual practitioners instrumentalize the body, for example, as they perform throat singing that makes audible the body's resonant chambers, and as they perform instruments made of skulls and bones. Because the aim of this issue is to examine Buddhist practices cross-culturally, the articles here examine the Buddhist practices of diverse cultures, including China, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. The scholarly survey article "Buddhism and the Musical Cultures of Asia: A Critical Literature Survey," which encompasses a pan-Asian scope, also presents and discusses the Buddhist musical practices of Japan, Korea, Thailand, Tibet, and elsewhere. Our focus is ethnographic, and as such the articles in this issue expand our knowledge of the world of Bud- dhist music, documenting almost completely unstudied music-cultures in Vietnam and in South Kalim- antan (Indonesia), and understudied musical rituals and practices in China, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. • Margaret Kartomi: "Meaning, Style, and Change in Gamalan and Wayang Kulit Banjar Since Their Transplantation from Hindu-Buddhist Java to South Kalimantan," 17-55. Abstract : This article examines the origins and development of a syncretic Hindu-Buddhist-Animist musical theatre form known as wayang kulit Banjar (Banjarese leather puppet shadow theatre), a com- plex combination of word, music, drama, stagecraft, movement and mystical ritual. Transplanted with its accompanying gamalan music from Java in the fourteenth century, it survives to this day among the Banjarese people of South and East Kalimantan, a mainly Malay society which adopted Islam from</page><page sequence="73">2. Contents and Abstracts • 91 the sixteenth century. While Muslim influence in wayang kulit Banjar is only superficial, the story lines, puppet characters and texts preserve archaic Buddhist-Hindu-Javanese elements. Drawing on the literary sources as well as fieldwork interviews and recordings of performances, the author analyzes the cosmological association and meaning of elements of wayang kulit and gamalan musical style. Transcriptions are included of four excerpts from the author's 1993 recording of a Mahâbhârata-plot based shadow play entitled Terfitnah dalam Kejujuran ("Rumors Destroying Honesty"), led by senden dalang Abdullah and accompanied on a gamalan Banjar. • Phong T. Nguyen: "Music and Movement in Vietnamese Buddhism," 57-71 . Abstract : Buddhism is realized by a monastic community of meditators, preachers, and chanters. In- troduced to Vietnam in the second century A. D., Buddhism evolved into these three elements only ten centuries later. They coexist, each self-absorbed in its own activities. The chanting school, called ung phu, practices liturgical ceremonies which include a complex system of rituals, chants, and dances. They are performed in over two hundred ceremonies at temples or public places on numerous occa- sions. This article will attempt to describe and analyze the process of rituals, aspects of the Buddhist chanting dancing rules, and the philosophical meaning of ceremonies. • Tsai Tsan-Huang: "Is the Wind, the Banner, or the Mind Moving? The Concept of Body in Chinese Han Buddhist Ritual Performance and Its Musical Practices," 73-92. Abstract : This paper explores various concepts of body and its role in the ritual practices in contempo- rary Chinese Han Buddhist communities, with particular emphasis on the concepts of "profane body" and "sacred body," "moving" and "unmoving," and individual and group. The physical movements of the actual body and stabilization of the ritual body are discussed, together with a possible classifica- tion of Chinese Buddhist ritual music, which attempts to show the inner relationship between musical practices and Buddhist theory. Music, as suggested in this essay, becomes not only the mediator of the ambiguity between the actual and conceptual practices, but also the medium between the profane space and sacred space. Finally, this study illustrates how an ancient term can be interpreted in different ways according to an individual's understanding of "tradition(s)." • Paul D. Greene: "Sounding the Body in Buddhist Nepal: Neku Horns, Himalayan Shamanism, and the Transmigration of the Disembodied Spirit," 93-1 14. Abstract : In rituals following a death in the Kathmandu Valley, members of the Buddhist Manandhar (Oil Presser) caste of Newars sound the neku buffalo horn, a specially venerated, even deified instru- ment. The horn is likened to a relic of the dead person through mythical and symbolic identification of the buffalo as a person's incarnation. Many practitioners believe that the neku sound is heard and rec- ognized by the dead person as he or she journeys through the murky stages of death, disembodiment, and re-integration into a new mind-body complex. It is recognized as a helpful sound heard during previous transmigrations, when neku rituals also were performed. The dead person, whose progress toward rebirth may be hindered, follows the sound to find advantageous rebirth, and the living find healing, peace, and religious merit. Its mystical familiarity transcends the usually inscrutable boundar- ies of death and rebirth, and as Manandhars contemplate it, they reconceptualize their own bodies and actualize Buddhist soteriological beliefs. • Martina Claus-Bachmann: " Jataka Narrations as Multimedial Reconstructive Embodiments of the Mental System Buddha Shakyamuni," 1 15-34. Abstract : This article aims to unify constructivistic-systemic philosophy with Buddhist conceptions of embodiment. Music is analyzed as part of the constructive potential, through which both individual psychic systems and collective, cultural ones are created and maintained. The embodiment of a single psychic system in a sequence of incarnations is constructed in the Jataka tales in two specific ways: a) in the main actors of the stories, who are different persons but in the end one and the same, and b) in the personification of special qualities - like generosity, selflessness or honesty etc. - one of which the main actor of each story embodies, as specified by the narrative. As the continuity of a cultural system is always an act of memory and depends on the memory-related activities of the participants, the ar- ticle shows how multimedial performances of Jataka tales preserve, in part, the multimedial network</page><page sequence="74">92 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) of Theravada Buddhist culture in Sri Lanka today. Music is seen as an important part of this network, and one sensory component in the physical process of transferring the embodied content of the ancient story to the contemporary audience. Description and analysis engage three very different kinds of Ja- taka performances that exemplify the rich tradition and show continuity despite musical change: a) the archaic story-teller, who accompanies himself with his rabana , declaiming the Serivavanije Jataka at a Vesak pandah ; b) the verses of the Vessantara Jataka, which are sung or performed as a scenic play at funerals or other sad occasions; and c) a recent pop/rap version of the Sirisanghabo Jataka, reinter- preted by the male pop-duo Bathiya &amp; Santush. • Paul D. Greene, Keith Howard, Terry E. Miller, Phong T. Nguyen, and Hwee-San Tan: "Buddhism and the Musical Cultures of Asia: A Critical Literature Survey," 135-75. Abstract : This article surveys over three hundred scholarly works that examine music and Buddhism, published in twelve different languages. As ethnographic and historical research broadens our knowl- edge of Buddhist musical cultures, inquiries into specific research topics bring both Buddhism and Buddhist music into sharper focus, particularly when pursued from cross-cultural perspectives. Bud- dhist musicology, in its ethnographic, folkloric, textual, historical, and musicological dimensions, has tremendous and broad-based momentum. It is a rapidly growing field with much to offer, particularly if lingering obstacles separating the many scholarly literatures on Buddhist music can be bridged.

Abstract: This issue of the world of music presents case studies of Native American music in Canada, the United States of America, and on the World Wide Web. Similar to the music of other settler-colony, Indigenous peoples worldwide (e.g. New Zealand Maori, Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Is- landers), Native American music is notable for skillfully combining introduced/imposed forms with Indigenous aesthetics, themes and instrumentation. These articles highlight the eclecticism and fluidity of Contemporary Native American music, especially in the context of notions and processes of hybrid- ity and collaborative cultural production. • Beverley Diamond: "Native American Contemporary Music: The Women," 1 1-39. Abstract : This article explores issues raised in interviews with traditional and Contemporary Native American musicians and recording artists of the 1990s. It exemplifies how they view their roles vis à vis traditional gender structures and community obligations, how they draw upon different media to communicate their messages, and how they use their work as a form of social action. Their narratives reveal a wide variety of strategies by which they negotiate the double consciousness and multiple rela- tionships of their lives, balancing historically rooted values and traditions with modern ones. I attempt to develop a feminist interpretation that is respectful of the cultural values these women expressed in their conversations with me. voL 44, 2002(1)</page><page sequence="76">94 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Christopher A. Scales: "The Politics and Aesthetics of Recording: A Comparative Canadian Case Study of Powwow and Contemporary Native American Music," 41-59. Abstract : Recording studios exist at the intersection of musical creation and commerce, a commercial institution in the business of creating aesthetic products. The intersection is further complicated when Native North Americans enter the studio to record as the studio then becomes a place of intercultural contact, a meeting ground where meaning is jointly constructed and contested. This mutual construc- tion is embedded within both typical Fourth World power relations as well as the power structure cre- ated by the studio as a corporate/creative entity. This article employs a broadly comparative approach to explore both the activity of studio recording and the structural potentials and limitations of the re- cording studio as a unique site for Native American musical creation. Borrowing Bourdieu's concept of "social fields," a "Contemporary Native music" recording session and a powwow recording session are examined through an analysis of the differing interpersonal relationships and aesthetic discourses surrounding these two processes. These two "musical fields" are distinguished and defined by the rela- tionship between musical artist and record producer regarding perceived levels of cultural knowledge, musical authenticity, and socioeconomic power. • Paula Conlon: "The Native American Flute: Convergence and Collaboration as Exemplified by R. Carlos Nakai," 61-74. Abstract : This article will trace the history of the Native American flute with external block, looking at its traditional function, construction, distribution, decline and rejuvenation, culminating with the multi- tiered use of the Native American flute at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Recent developments in the evolution of the Native American flute from a private courtship ritual to a more public expression of Native identity allow for an interaction of musical styles. Ute/Navajo flutist R. Carlos Nakai describes his music as "contemporary traditional," stating that he builds on the memories of his heritage, utilizing the experiences that surround him to revitalize the ancient stories. The efforts of Nakai as an emissary connecting the Native American flute to a myriad of other cultures will be examined. • Elaine Keillor: "Amerindians at the Rodeos and Their Music," 75-94. Abstract : After the First Peoples of North America adopted the horse in the Plains and Plateau regions, early contact written documentation and oral indigenous testimony refer to a range of songs associ- ated with horses such as Riding Songs. With the demise of the buffalo, the life style of these peoples changed drastically and they became involved in ranching and rodeo. Although the original circum- stances for singing certain kinds of songs connected with the horse were no longer available, Plains/ Plateau persons involved in ranches and rodeos continued to sing, often using Horse Dance songs and Riding Songs. They were also using forms of 'rubbaboos' which included Euro-Canadian/American folksongs of rodeo/ranching life, otherwise often called cowboy songs. These two streams of songs associated with the horse can be detected in contemporary songs of Native performers such as Bufìy Sainte-Marie, Dave Schildt, and Tim Ryan. • Annette Chrétien: " Under the Double Eagle : From Military March to Métis Miziksharing," 95-114. Abstract "Under the Double Eagle" examines the question of Métis identity through local, Métis musical performance practices. As an inherent component of Métis identity, music-making in a small Northern Ontario community, Mattawa, serves as a vehicle through which a deeper understanding of connections between music, Métis intellectual traditions and spiritual beliefs inform contemporary Métis identities. This is accomplished by tracing the path of a 19th century military march that eventu- ally found its way to this community. • Karl Neuenfeldt: " www.nativeamericanmusic.com : Marketing Recordings in an Interconnected World, 115-26.

Abstract : Based on interviews with Native American powwow musicians in southwestern Ontario, this article examines the issues around song sharing and the cultural protocol that is expected in performing music created by other musicians. It demonstrates the roles that individual musicians play in the trans- mission of this genre, highlights the expectations surrounding the transmission of powwow music, and illustrates the impact of commercial recordings and portable recording equipment on the dissemination of this music genre. This article illustrates the dynamism and vitality of this music and highlights the ways in which technology has impacted on traditional song sharing protocol. • Klisala Harrison: "The Kwagiulth Dancers: Addressing Intellectual Property Issues at Victoria's First Peoples Festivals," 137-51. Abstract : This article examines how the Kwagiulth Dancers, a Kwakwaka'wakw dance group, negoti- ate various intellectual property issues at their presentations of music and dance for the First Peoples Festival, arguably Canada's largest indigenous arts festival. In it, I discuss Kwagiulth Dancers' speech- es on traditional Kwakwaka'wakw concepts of intellectual property. In so doing, I contrast definitions and uses of intellectual property advocated by Canada's legal establishment with those endorsed by Kwagiulth Dancers. I identify ways in which some Kwagiulth Dancers think legislation on intellectual property should be changed to accommodate traditional Kwakwaka'wakw forms of ownership. As well, I consider implications of the speeches for cultural revival. Book Reviews (Jonathan Stock, ed.) • Jonathan Stock: "Whither Historical Ethnomusicology?" 153-54. • Jim Samson: "J.

Neither universalistic nor cultural-relativistic plans can, with their exaggerated expectations, provide answers for our contemporary times. In our longing for simple political formulas, such abbreviated polarities are still labeled "particularism" versus "homogenization." Samuel P. Huntington (1993) de- scribed this underlying tendency for post-modern times with his catchy phrases: 1) the thesis of mod- ernization and westernization of cultures ("the West against the Rest") or 2) the thesis of "the clash of civilizations." Only a dialogue of cultures carried out on equal footing can lead us out of both these dead ends: a dialogue that takes place within the dynamic of intercultural encounter and that principally recognizes the Other in his/her Otherness, without over-emphasizing or suppressing the Own. Music festivals, which present such a traditional diversity of different cultures, form the ideal location for transcultural encounter in practice, both in experiencing the Other as well as the Self. The goal of this volume is to investigate and reflect upon general questions related to intercultural understanding using the examples of music making, of musical performance, and of the dynamic of local and global musi- cal concepts. In particular, different musical concepts will be introduced and discussed on the basis of selected case studies. Several questions stand in the foreground of analysis: Is there some-thing like a "clash of cultures" between traditional musics of different areas?

Abstract : Today regional traditions interrelate with musical diversity, intercultural music making, and improvisation. In an era of tourism, migration, festivals, technologically determined globalization and a world that is growing smaller, the conceptualization of culture and region is expressed through music in highly differentiated ways. The region in which music is made can be differentiated from the tran- scultural region, which is represented symbolically through music. • Bernhard Hanneken: "Concepts and Contexts of the Tanz- &amp; FolkFest Rudolstadt," 31-47. Abstract : Festivals abound: Festivals on traditional and religious music, on music from Africa and Asia, festivals of vocal music and of brass bands. And then there is the Tanz&amp;FolkFest Rudolstadt in Thuringia (in the former GDR). It is a festival with an open concept - with the result that some dub it "a festival of festivals." Based on a history of (state) dance festivals that dates back to 1955, Rudolstadt rejuvenated its main cultural activities after the German reunification and changed its name from Tanz- fest to Tanz&amp;FolkFest. This article looks back at its history and thus describes an event that is quite unique in the current festival circuit. • Owe Ronström: "Concerts and Festivals: "Public Performances of Folk Music in Sweden," 49-64. Abstract : This article deals with public performances of folk music in Sweden. After a few introduc- tory remarks on events as study objects, follows a brief historical survey of some main forms or for- mats of such performances. An analytical model is then presented, which is used to explain some of the changes that has occurred in public presentations of folk music in Sweden. Then the modern folk music festival is examined, a type of event that in short time has been spread all over the world. Folk music festivals, it is argued, can be read as texts, complex as they are, full of significance, and pregnant with meaning. But they can also be seen as instruments, powerful tools for change, manipulation, for overriding old power structures and cultural borders, as well as setting up new. • Karl Neuenfeldt: "From Silence to Celebration: Indigenous Australian Performers at the Woodford Folk Festival," 65-91. Abstract : Presently in Australia there are a range of performance opportunities available to Australia's two Indigenous peoples: Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Folk festivals in particular currently provide an important outlet for their talents as musicians, storytellers, and dancers. This chapter exam- ines the Murri Program at the Woodford Folk Festival, the largest in the southern hemisphere. High- lighted are the insights of a key organizer of the Murri Programme, Walbira Watts, detailing how she negotiates and navigates the complex issues of politics, protocols, programming, and personalities. It is argued the Murri Program is and historically notable change from exclusion to inclusion and plays a positive role in ethnogenesis and the construction of Aboriginality. • Linda Fujie: "Japanese Taiko Drumming in International Performance: Converging Musical Ideas in the Search for Success on Stage," 93-01. Abstract : Since the 1970s groups of taiko drummers, playing various sizes of Japanese traditional drums and other instruments in a choreographed stage presentation, have toured throughout the world and enjoyed unprecedented success in countless festivals and concert halls outside of Japan. Elements of their performance that appeal to international audiences include their emphasis on an aesthetic based on samurai values, an aesthetic that stresses discipline, hard physical and mental training, group coor- dination and perfectionism. Taiko groups illustrate well the convergence of often conflicting musical values in the emergence of local groups on the international stage. What is considered locally important may lose importance before an international audience in favor of a more cliché-oriented "national" image.</page><page sequence="80">98 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Tran Quang Hai: "Vietnamese Music in Exile since 1975 and Musical Life in Vietnam since Perestroika," 103-12. Abstract : The exile of some millions of Vietnamese refugees after the fall of Saigon in 1975 gave birth to a new type of music outside of Vietnam. Traditional music has been in regression because of the lack of interest among youngsters. Pop music, on the other hand, is flourishing, especially in the United States, where there is a big concentration of Vietnamese emigrants. Contemporary music in the Western idiom is in its early stages. In Vietnam, pop music has come back since around 1990, with perestroika. Traditional music has also gained in popularity due to the efforts made by the Institute of Musicology (Viên Âm nhac) in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and thanks to a number of festivals organized in main cities. • Martin Boiko: "The Latvian Folk Music Movement in the 1980s and 1990s: From 'Authenticity' to ' Postfolklore ' and Onwards," 113-18. Abstract : In the 1970s a new folk music revival movement emerged in Latvia that opposed the of- ficial Soviet amateur art that was financed and controlled by the totalitarian state. 'Authenticity' was the catchword of the new movement, which soon became a factor of national identity and a latent protest movement against the Soviet regime. This article describes the relationships between the new movement and Soviet amateur art and the aesthetical and ideological contradictions within the new movement itself, as well as the development of an outstanding musician - Ilga Reizniece, leader of the popular group IJgi - as a case study. • Svanibor Pettan: "Encounter with 'The Others' from Within: The Case of Gypsy Musicians in Former Yugoslavia," 119-37. Abstract : This essay is composed of four thematic circles. The first circle provides an introduction to the issue of "Otherness" in folk music research in the territories of what was the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The second circle points to the features of "Otherness" associated with Gypsy musicians and presents some research approaches to their music and musicianship. The third circle fo- cuses on Gypsy musicians in Kosovo and presents one specific approach to the question of their musi- cal taste. The fourth circle concerns the issue of representation based on the humanitarian project Kos- ovo Roma. Gypsy musician's perception of their own music directly contradicted the values advocated by folk music researchers, thus their musicianship was often subjected to negative interpretations. It is much closer to the holistic perspective advocated by an anthropologically conceived ethnomusicology. Gaining insight into the musicianship of these "Others from within" has the potential to overcome the nationally determined scope of research in the territories of former Yugoslavia and lead to a broader look at the musical practices within the given territories. • Ursula Hemetek: "Music of Minorities between Exclusion and Ethnoboom. Intercultural Encounter in Austria," 139-52. Abstract : Austria is a country with a long multicultural tradition. There are many minority groups, most of them performing "their" traditional music as a marker of identity. In the area of public performance there are two main strategies for presenting traditional music of minorities. They are called "consum- ing multiculturalism" and "the informative strategy" in this paper. These strategies are described by using examples from the Burgenland Croats, an autochthonous minority, and from the Bosnian refugee community. • Oskár Elschek: "Folklore Festivals and Their Current Typology," 153-69.

Changing artistic and medial interests turn now to tradi- tional art and music that is based upon and expressed in the rising revival movement. The new genre had to find and develop new stage, scenic, and theatrical forms for folk music presentation.

The festival movement in Slovakia, with about 90 festivals per year, covers a large range of events aimed at presenting the "authentic," village groups, ensembles, and children plays, competitions concerning instruments, instrumental music, dance, and regional programs, national, international and other kinds of performances. Exhibitions, folk art markets, handicrafts, presentation of instrument makers and many other events supplement the festivals. They are accompanied by special publications including, apart from printed matter, records, CD collections, and videos. This article describes and analyzes the program structures of these festivals. A special and important aspect is the cooperation be- tween festival organizers and ethnomusicologists, which brings remarkable advantages for both sides, especially regarding the preparation of comprehensive programs, workshops, conferences and audio- visual documentation of festivals. • Hans-Hinrich Thedens: "'How Funny - I am at a Folk Music Event and I Don't Know a Soul Here!': Musicians and Audiences at the International Folk Music Festivals in Norway, 171-81. Abstract : Two international folk music festivals were established in Norway in the end of the 1980s, both by people from the traditional Norwegian music scene, and both with the goal to win new audi- ences for this music. Both have had remarkable success, but while many urban members of the audi- ence now enjoy both foreign and Norwegian music at the festivals, the traditional musicians have not embraced them. They do not form a large part of the audience and they are not offering the kind of stageable productions the festival programmers are looking for. As a consequence the festivals concen- trate increasingly on local audiences. • Josep Marti: "Music and Ethnicity in Barcelona," 183-92. Abstract The musical practices of a given place do not always correspond with the idea people might have about the "musical culture" of that place. That lack of correspondence produces clear contradic- tions in the ways in which reality is interpreted. Sometimes the problem resides in ideologized ethnic interpretations and sometimes in the use of conceptual categories that perhaps, in an unconscious manner, are also deeply influenced by ethnic ideologies. Huntington's thesis, for instance, serves to illustrate the easiness with which people today politically instrumentalize the idea of "culture." The musical life of every city that can be considered modern, complex and fully integrated in the global- ized world constitutes a valuable and useful field of analysis of all these ethnic narratives. This article focuses on this subject and attempts to give some critical views about such categories through the example of Barcelona. • Manfred Bartmann: "Spotlights on Festival History and Communication: Folk Legends Work on the Great Hits of Rock and Popular Music," 193-206. Abstract : Throughout the years some of the milestones of rock music have been interpreted by English, Irish and Scottish folk legends. These somehow "traditional ized" cover versions allow us to experience highly individual or regional styles of playing at first hand. Being widely known, almost evergreens, they bear the chance to drag the audience's attention away from the song as such and to focus on how the artist handles it. Secondly these examples encourage us to examine the history of folk festivals, especially how dialogue is and was created between "modernists" and traditionalists, between tradi- tional folk music and "global pop." With reference to this some mechanisms which determine group communications are considered. As far as the British Isles are concerned, folk musicians seem to have been in a dialogue with rock and popular music since the rise of these latter styles.

Abstract Including many nationalities speaking different languages and possessing their own cultural heritage, China is a place where many local traditions have flourished; they share a cultural background but are diverse nonetheless. The Uighur are the people in question here. How then to reconcile ethnic diversity and cultural unity? How can this cultural unity be recognized by all its constituent ethnic groups? This conjuncture is not new to central Chinese power. One important factor in the integration of minorities is that they become familiar with each other's cultural products, and music is probably the most portable of all. But the music of any group constitutes a strong identity component. What to do to make it more accessible? Order it, overhaul it, diffuse it and, if necessary, impose it back. In that way a national music can be constructed. Hence to sinicize Uighur music is also to make it accessible to the Han population who would incorporate it into their imaginaire and could perhaps be enticed to move to such uncongenial regions as Xinjiang or Tibet and so facilitate the migration policies of a central government eager to shift population away from the densely concentrated coastal band. • Rachel Harris: "Rees, Helen.

Abstract : Ethnomusicologists have turned to biography as a result of three trends within the discipline. First, in our fieldwork we encounter and observe musical individuals, sometimes (but not always) in environments where musical individuality is a marked characteristic of the musical culture as a whole. Second, reappraisal of the politics of representation in ethnographic writing has encouraged us to docu- ment more closely the interactions of specific individuals. Finally, new notions of culture themselves place greater emphasis on individual role and agency, thus stimulating us to look at more length at the individual choices made by musicians and others. The writing of biography, nonetheless, has emphases that mark it as partially distinct from ethnographic research, most clearly in its reliance on historical data not observed first-hand by the ethnomusicologist. There may be less space in someone else's life for the participatory and experiential models proposed in recent discussions of fieldwork. • David Harnish: "A Hermeneutical Arc in the Life of Balinese Musician, I Made Lebah," 21-41. Abstract. This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics. vol. 43, 2001 (1)</page><page sequence="84">102 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Helen Rees: "He Yi'an's Ninety Musical Years: Biography, History, and Experience in Southwest China," 43-67. Abstract He Yi'an (1908-93) was a major figure in the Dongjing music tradition of Lijiang, a remote, mountainous county in southwest China's Yunnan Province. This amateur ritual music tradition flour- ished before the Communist victory of 1949, continuing for several years thereafter as a purely secular instrumental genre. Revived in its secular format in the late 1970s, since 1988 the music has been spec- tacularly popular in concerts to entertain foreign and domestic tourists. He Yi'an was a leading light in the maintenance and transmission of the ritual music tradition before 1 949, and a prominent player in its commercial transformation forty years later. His negotiation of the complex and conflicting mean- ings attached to these different contexts speaks to an intricate intertwining of personal experience with social history; and his life story illustrates the importance of outstanding individuals in the maintenance and development of regional music traditions. • Joseph S.C. Lam: "Writing Music Biographies of Historical East Asian Musicians: The Case of Jiang Kui (A.D. 1155-1221)," 69-95. Abstract : Ethnomusicologists are now paying attention to music biographies as a means to understand musicians, their music, and their cultural environment. Among numerous Chinese biographies, those of Jiang Kui (A. D. 1 155-1221), the famed poet-composer-calligrapher-scholar of the Southern Song dy- nasty of China (1 127-1279) are particularly significant. They not only tell the creative life of a unique Chinese musician who played a seminal role in Chinese music history and culture, but also provide data and questions for the writing of music biographies and histories. In this paper, I present biographi- cal data of Jiang Kui and samples of his known biographies - autobiographical, socialist, literary, and musical - to describe a unique Chinese musician and his creative works, pinpoint distinctive features of traditional Chinese music culture, demonstrate the need for biographical understandings of histori- cal East Asian musicians, and illustrate the issues in writing contemporary music biographies. • Regula Burckhardt Qureshi: "In Search of Begum Akhtar: Patriarchy, Poetry, and Twentieth-Century Indian Music," 97-137. Abstract : Begum Akhtar is best known for her sophisticated mastery of Urdu poetry and light classical music in th eghazal of North India and Pakistan. Her musical legacy emerges from a set of relationships defined by the elasticity and rigidity of gendered identities in patriarchal, post-colonial Indian society. Situating her artistry in relation to the backdrop of historical forces that framed the course of her career, this paper foregrounds the dynamic changes that confronted a hereditary musical tradition in a fading system of feudal patronage. It also reflexively engages the myriad voices and encounters that have con- tributed to the evolving discourse that continues to mold Begum Akhtar 's remarkable life history. • Amelia Maciszewski: "Stories About Selves: Selected North Indian Women's Musical (Auto)Biographies," 139-172. Abstract This article highlights the lives and music of six professional women musicians whose train- ing and performance practice reflect the Hindustani music idiom of North India. I examine numer- ous issues faced by these women in the context of their personal histories. These include limitations imposed on the women; choices available to them; the ongoing crafting of their respective identities through each one's positioning, as well as negotiation of her self, body, and emotions through dis- course, an essential part of which is music. I locate my work in the movement away from Western- centered ethnography, in which a scholar omnisciently reports "objective" information. I choose in- stead, through my effort to build a dialogic relationship, to highlight individuals' narratives as vividly as possible, allowing their voices to articulate their own agency, creativity, and difference. My analysis of how musicians, particularly women, have used this space to construct and, when they feel necessary, reinvent their subjectivity clearly relates to the role of the expressive arts as a practice of the reproduc- tion of (gendered) consciousness. By providing a conduit for these women to tell their stories through words, music, and visual images, thereby transmitting their cultural knowledge, I demonstrate my be- lief that documenting women's oral narratives of their own realities is an act of advocacy.</page><page sequence="85">2.

Rainer Polak (Bayreuth) studies the reciprocal effects of the jenbe drum in Mali; Kevin Dawe (Belfast) deals with roots music in Crete and in contrast to ways with the world at large; Deborah Wong's essay (Riv- erside, CA) addresses the Japanese tradition of taiko drumming as an Asian American practice inflected by transnational discourses of orientalism and colonialism; J. Lawrence Witzleben (Hong Kong) ques- tions musical genres and inter-genre relationships with reference to Chinese music and Hong Kong identity; Colin Huehns (London) shows how the Qinpai school of erhu playing arose as a response to a particular set of political, musical and social conditions as generated in post- 1949 Communist China; finally Max Peter Baumann (Bamberg) discusses aspects of local and global representation of tradi- tional musical instruments in the transcultural discourse. • Rainer Polak: "A Musical Instrument Travels Around the World: Jenbe Playing in Bamako, West Africa, and Beyond," 7^16. Abstract : Jenbe drum ensemble music has appeared in a variety of contexts, namely: local family and communal celebrations, state-organized folklore ensembles in West Africa, and West African percus- sion music in the industrialized countries. These contexts of jenbe playing emerged one after the other, partly developing out of one another. However, they did not supersede nor leave each other unaffected. This article studies the reciprocal effects of local, national, and international utilization of the jenbe , il- lustrated by the changes in instrument making in Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali. It argues that only the feedback of local, national, and international jenbe playing has allowed its artistic and professional vitality in urban West Africa to grow. • Kevin Dawe: "Roots Music in the Global Village: Cretan Ways of Dealing with the World at Large," 47-66. vol. 42, 2000 (3)</page><page sequence="86">104 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : This article discusses the role of local music industry within the changing physical, social and cultural landscape of Crete. Conducted over a ten-year period, my fieldwork was at its most in- tense during 1990, 1991, 1994, 1996, and 2000, and it is these years of research that I refer to in my discussion. These research trips enabled me to collect a range of information that has proven useful when considering globalization processes at work in Crete, and within the Cretan music scene. Infor- mal music making, the presence of music at festive occasions, and talk and debate about music are still important in Cretan life. However, as I hope to show in this article, the impact and development of a local music industry along with a range of other phenomena has progressively and significantly altered the contexts in which Cretan music is heard, performed, talked of and thought about. Today, more than ever, the music industry and the media (from record producers to poster designers) are responsible for shaping a vision of "traditional music" in Crete. During a period of enormous social and economic change on the island, the music industry has continued to underline and perhaps exploit connections between Cretan music and village life. Moreover, musicians and musical entrepreneurs continue to adapt their activities to the changing and globalizing marketplace whilst tapping into a nostalgic vision of "tradition" where stock sounds, metaphors and images are used to make powerful statements about Cretanness, roots, authenticity and difference within the Cretan world at large. • Deborah Wong: " Taiko and the Asian/American Body: Drums, Rising Sun, and the Question of Gender," 67-78. Abstract : This essay addresses the Japanese tradition of taiko drumming as an Asian American practice inflected by transnational discourses of orientalism and colonialism. I argue that the potential in taiko for slippage between the Asian and the Asian American body is both problematic and on-going, and that the body of the taiko player is gendered and racialized in complex ways. Through a consideration of a scene in the film "Rising Sun" (1993), I address a key cinematic misrepresentation of taiko and its impact on the North American taiko community. I contrast imperialist American tropes that feminize Japan with the predominance of Japanese American and Asian American women who play taiko in the U.S., and I suggest that taiko has become a means for Asian American women to recuperate racist and sexist narratives in a deeply personal and physical manner that implicates the very definition of the Asian American woman's body. I argue that the sensual sounded body has moved through a series of historical constructions and emerges asserting new Asian American presences, recasting issues of cultural authenticity in the process. • J. Lawrence Witzleben: "Musical Systems and Inter-genre Relationships in Hong Kong," 79-92. Abstract In any community, village, or city, the network of musical styles, genres, and performers constitute a "musical system." In a metropolis such as Hong Kong, there are also various interlinked subsystems which can be interpreted according to various parameters such as ethnicity (Chinese, other Asian, European), type of music (classical, folk, popular), or livelihood (professional, semi-profession- al, amateur). The present article focuses on the subsystem of Chinese music in Hong Kong, including its local, regional, national, and transnational elements, indigenous Cantonese culture and intracultural transplants from elsewhere in China, performance contexts, and networks of performers. By thinking about what Bruno Netti has called the "total music" of a community, we can gain new perspectives on its component parts and their relationship to each other and to the whole. By examining inter-genre relationships in a given locale, we can also approach a fuller understanding of Chinese music: despite its practical advantages, the genre-based approach typically used in scholarship and teaching can ob- scure the dynamic interplay of instrumental, vocal, theatrical, and religious traditions within a regional (Cantonese) or local (Hong Kong) music subculture. These themes in turn may contribute to our un- derstanding of music in other multi-ethnic or multi-dialect societies and in other large and complex urban centers. • Colin Huehns: "The Shaanxi Qinpai Erhu Tradition: Re-invention and Re-invigoration of a Folk Tradition," 93-19.</page><page sequence="87">2. Contents and Abstracts • 105 Abstract : This paper outlines the main distinguishing features of the Qinpai school of erhu playing of the Chinese province of Shaanxi, shows how this style of erhu playing arose as a response to a par- ticular set of political, musical and social conditions as generated in post- 1949 Communist China, and discusses how these conditions and the music they have produced are related to a process of "global- ization" or "Westernization;" in other words: to what extent is the Qinpai erhu music intrinsically na- tive, that is the music of the Chinese Province of Shaanxi, and to what extent is it a product of outside influences. The author is himself a member of the Qinpai erhu school and has spent four years at the Xi'an Music College of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province as an erhu pupil of Jin Wei, the leading exponent of the Qinpai school of erhu playing. • Max Peter Baumann: "The Local and the Global: Traditional Musical Instruments and Modernization," 121^4. Abstract : Today regional traditions have an interactive relationship with musical multilingualism and intercultural music-making, and improvisation. In our age of tourism, migration, the growing closer of the world and of technologically determined globalization, the conceptualization of culture and region are musically realized in highly individual and differentiated ways. The region in which music is made is thereby to be differentiated from the (trans)region that is presented symbolically through music. For a long time now, musical identity no longer refers simply one-dimensionally to a single region. In the area of music, increasing multipolar orientations create a continuous deconstruction of concepts of culture and identity. The local and the region, the national and the global have become interconnected in the cultural process of tradition to a "giocai" network.

Abstract : Spirit possession and shamanist practices have sometimes been mystified in scholarly rep- resentations, whether intentionally or not, as comprising self-contained or closed symbolic systems. These systems then are commonly portrayed as operating largely in archaic, recessed places, removed from dialecticism with, or influences from, the goings-on of other more visible worlds. Indeed, spans of time, place, and memory themselves can mediate perceptions of spiritual authenticity. Such spans as well might in varied ways enhance the desire to comprehend or even emulate a Spirit Other. Spirit- related practices, though, are not merely geographically and ideologically distant. Such practices have flourished in San Francisco and colonial Virginia as well as on Reservations, in Antananarivo (Mada- gascar) and Marseille, in West African villages as well as in Accra and New York. Not only have spirit practices long been prevalent in "Western," urban, even metropolitan settings, the global as well has reached into those corners of the world often thought to be the primary sanctuaries of these practices. • Daniel Avorgbedor: " Dee Hoo ! Sonic Articulations in Healing and Exorcism Practices of the Anlo-Ewe," 9-24. Abstract : The Anlo-Ewe frequently employ the "hidden" and manifest properties of a variety of sound forms in their ritual performances that seek to restore balance or health in individual biophysiologies or in an entire village community. It is within these contexts of ritual performances that the Anlo-Ewe ritual experts and participants exhibit their extended notions and skills about sound. Evidence from healing and exorcism practices show a wide range of sound types that vary in meaning and affect, ac- cording to their specific contexts of employment. This essay explores a selection of these unique sound types along their acoustic traits, instruments and means of production, contexts, and the general local conceptual framework guiding the production and use of these sounds. A central focus is to explain the supra-human properties of sound that are thought to be capable of engaging the "hidden" forces in order to effect physical and spiritual well-being in individuals and communities. This investigation of sound forms will elucidate also the conception and articulation of sound as an extension of the general aesthetic domain of musical activities, and how musical meaning is constituted variously, from culture to culture, and from one context to another within the same culture. • Judith Becker: "Listening Selves and Spirit Possession," 25-50. Abstract : This essay explores the idea that certain senses of personhood or styles of subjectivity pre- clude the experience of spirit possession, while certain others may encourage it. Notably, the Cartesian "self," the rational, self-controlled, disengaged self tends to hold in contempt those who practice spirit possession, with its surrender of control and lack of ironic distance. Conversely, those who tend to have strong emotional reactions to musical stimuli and those who do not maintain "aesthetic distance" or an ironic stance toward experience, are more likely to be involved in spirit possession ceremonies. The listening subject in a spirit possession ceremony is ever alert to musical signals that indicate the presence of divine beings and the possibility of personal transformation. Drawing upon materials from evangelicals in colonial Virginia and contemporary U. S. Pentecostals, the author contrasts the non- ironic, engaged selves who may be involved with experiences of transcendent unity with holy beings and the Cartesian selves whose sense of an appropriate style of selfhood centers more on self-control vol. 42, 2000 (2)</page><page sequence="89">2. Contents and Abstracts • 107 and "rationality." These two American styles of self are then compared with trancers and those who do not trance among the Bugis peoples in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Bugis believe that one's vital spirit, sumange ', may diminish if one's bodily integrity is penetrated. Spirit possession is felt to be a kind of invasion of the body by outside forces. One group of transvestite priests, called bissu, is able to transcend this cultural injunction and allow the penetration of spirit possession and to flirt with a sec- ond penetration, i. e. self-stabbing. The special powers of the bissu that permit transgression of cultural norms of sensible behavior also allow them to be the intermediaries between the world of humankind and the spirits of the upper realm. The author concludes that more than one style of selfhood may be available even within societies with a preferred, hegemonic style of self, and that only the listening self-susceptible to the transport of musically-driven holy narratives, will accept spirit possession. • Ron Emoff: "Clinton, Bush, and Hussein in Madagascar," 51-73. Abstract : In the Tamatave region on the east coast of Madagascar, musical performance commonly is a powerful medium for bringing spirits of ancient Malagasy royalty into the present ceremonial moment. Newer spirits from yet distant places sometimes take visceral shape alongside these royal Malagasy spirit personalities. Thus varying epochs become conflated one into the other. Musical performance not only mediates the political, the historical, the memorable among Malagasy in spirit-related ceremo- nies - it is an expressive embodiment of these realms of experience. Through music-dependent perfor- mance Malagasy can recall their pasts while imagining and commenting upon the present. • Barley Norton: "Vietnamese Mediumship Rituals: The Musical Construction of the Spirits," 75-97. Abstract : In this article, I examine the role of music during Vietnamese mediumship rituals, len dong. After providing a brief introduction to len dong and the music performed during rituals, chau van , I ad- dress the importance of music for possession through a discussion of len dong putatively without mu- sic. This is followed by a more detailed investigation into how the aural invocation of the spirits relates to possession experiences and how chau van facilitates bodily engagement with the spirits by creating a sense of ritual time, animating possession and inciting dance. In the final sections of the article I argue that music plays a vital role in the construction of the spirits through various imaginings that relate to place, gender and ethnicity. I also consider how these imaginings relate to nationalist discourse on "eth- nic minority" groups in Vietnam. I will argue that chau van does more than simply "identify" posses- sion (see Rouget 1980). Rather, chau van is constitutive of spiritual presence: music enables mediums to assume new identities and to engage with places and people beyond their local worlds. • Katherine J. Hagedorn: "Bringing Down the Santo : An Analysis of Possession Performance in Afro-Cuban Santería, " 99-1 13. Abstract This article offers a performative analysis of oricha possession performance in Afro-Cuban santería. Although the article stems from ten years of fieldwork, it focuses on a particular instance of oricha possession that occurred at a toque de santo (public ritual drumming ceremony) in July 1997. In santería , the possession of a religious devotee by an oricha , or deity, is an important and powerful event because it is a clearly visible manifestation of the convergence between humanness and divine potential. In this piece, I examine the relationship between "appropriate" and "inappropriate" behavior at a toque de santo , which leads to a related discussion of some of the criteria for determining "real" versus "folkloric" possession performances. • Marina Roseman: "The Canned Sardine Spirit Takes the Mie," 1 15-36. Abstract : The Temiars of peninsular Malaysia have long lived at the nexus of the local and the global, responding to interactions ranging from those with pre-colonial Malay lowland court cultures, to the British colonialists, to the Japanese Occupation during World War II and its postcolonial aftermath. In this article, I suggest that Temiar spirit mediums are mediators and song ceremonies are sites for me- diating social change. Songs, received during dreams from the animated spirits of entities with whom Temiars have interacted during daily life, encapsulate and reproduce both the continuity of a cosmolog- ical system and incorporate the radical social, environmental, and political changes that Temiars have undergone from pre-colonial times through to the present global economy. From songs received from</page><page sequence="90">108 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) fresh river fish spirits to those from canned sardines, I trace a trajectory of musical and religious vitality amidst environmental devastation and social reorganization in the Malaysian rainforest. Through their musical and spiritual practices, I suggest, Temiars craft their dance of survival as they grapple with displacement and stake their place in the nation-state.

Enchanting Powers: Music in the World's Religions " 137-45. Abstract : Rev. Johnson's singing his religion raised questions for me concerning whether religious sys- tems of belief are dependent on music to communicate their history. Further questions arise when mu- sic and religion are conceptualized within a coextensive moment: how, for example, do Islam and Bud- dhism conceptualize music? Whose Islam and whose Buddhism? And whose idea of music? Whose idea of religion? Where does the secular start and the sacred end? Questions such as these loom large when reading the articles in Lawrence E. Sullivan's edited volume, Enchanting Powers. It is a sub- stantial attempt to bring together a body of theoretical, historical, ethnographic, and experiential data with the purpose of expanding access to the common ground shared by ethnomusicology and the study of world religions, and as such represents a significant marker for any future efforts to study music in the world's religions. • Eric Charry: "Michelle Kisliuk.

Abstract: In music education, concepts that turn away from a fixed canon and object-related referral to an "opus," instead focusing on the students as subjects, offer possible connections with ethnomusi- cological reflections. In particular, the "experience-related music education" of Nykins is regarded as a basic model upon which an ethnomusicological-anthropological approach can be built. This model is based upon the musical-cultural world of youth - it refers to the experiences of the students, to their participation in the instructional processes, and to making connections with real life. • Martina Claus-Bachmann: "Cultural Identity and Educational Possibilities in Humanistic Studies," 13-24. Abstract : Based on current observations made in classrooms, this article attempts to theoretically clas- sify the more recent interpretations of the concepts "culture" and "cultural identity," thus developing a new cognitive framework that could be applied to the didactics and methods of music instruction in general education schools in Germany In this, music, as a form of cultural expression, is considered a part of a "Grenzmarkenvorrat" (supply of identity-borderline markers), that is, as something that marks the identity of youth. Points of orientation include the cultural systems in which youths prefer to move and not the bourgeois culture of dominance that determines teaching curricula and teacher education. An example of pragmatic action in everyday school life is provided by a multimedia project produced by a working group of students on the topic of cultural identity. • Ansgar Jerrentrup: "Gothic - Forms and Backgrounds," 25-50. Abstract: Within music-oriented youth subcultures, the Gothics and Darks represent an extraordinary phenomenon. This is shown not only in their external behavior in scene-related gatheirings, but also in their music, particularly in Dark Wave and the "dark" and secretive messages that are to be transmit- ted through it. • Friedrich Neumann: "The Roots of Hip hop: Origins, Characteristics and Creative Processes," 51-63. Abstract : Originating in the United States, rap music first began to spread throughout Europe in the ear- ly 1 990s and eventually became an important musical means for young people to express their feelings. The over-thirty generation, however, viewed the music with condescension, feeling that such repetitive rhythms and restricted use of harmony formed an inferior kind of popular music. This article examines the significant structural and content-related features of hip hop, contrasting them in the context of the musical value systems of Europe and Africa. voL 42, 2000 (I)</page><page sequence="92">110 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Ansgar Jerrentrup: "Techno Music: Its Special Characteristics and Didactic Perspectives," 65-82.

Abstract : The history of heavy metal reaches back to the 1960s. An independent cultural practice de- veloped in the 1970s and experienced its height during the 1980s, declining in popularity in the course of the following decade. Today the heavy metal scene in Germany is a multifaceted cultural landscape in which a diversity of styles that developed over three decades coexists side by side, more or less peacefully. In spite of their many differences, most fans feel themselves to be members of one family because all heavy metal styles are based on the same basic musical patterns, the values supporting their culture have remained predominantly the same and the music's negative image has unified the fans in their indignation. • Stefanie Rhein: "Being a Fan is More than That" - Fan-Specific Involvement with Music," 95-109. Abstract : In the research project introduced here, being a teenie fan is understood as membership in a youth culture that defines itself through musical taste, specific approaches to popular music, the ap- propriation of specific competencies regarding, and knowledge of, a favorite kind of music and hav- ing these at one's disposal. Using some central results of a survey of 217 teenie fans and non-fans in Germany on a multimedia computer, it can be shown that teenie fandom means active music-related behavior that is carried out in the social text of a fan group or fan community. Through this, common prejudices against fans can be contradicted, for example, that they are passive daydreamers who lack an identity, have little social contact and who are more interested in particular stars than in the music itself. • Gunther Diehl: . . .the fleeting association in a flash of inspiration. . . ' : On the Dimension of Aesthetic Intensity in Music-Related Expressive Forms of Youth Culture," 11-24. Abstract. A double thesis forms the starting point of this article. The first is that youths carry out their membership in subcultural scenes by individually active participation in lifestyles and expressive forms. The construction of reality in this context - independent from the specific stylistic genre - is always aesthetically determined. This fact is discussed here with fundamental cultural-philosophical thoughts on intensity as a category of aesthetic experience. That is, intensity is regarded as a state of suspense between direct emotional arousal and the intentionally heightened consciousness of this process, referring to the work of Ludger Heidbrink. The second thesis involves the concept of "at- mosphere" (within an ecological aesthetic of nature) as stressed by Gemot Böhme, which seems par- ticularly helpful for an explanatory approach to the phenomenon of the music of youth. The thoughts expressed here lead to a plea for a dialogue-oriented ethic of respect that is virtually dependent upon the double poles of emotional affect and intellectual consciousness. • Susanne Binas: "Youth Subcultures are Dead!? - On the Cultural Logic of the "Generation Z" and the Consequences for Music Educational Concepts, 125-36. Abstract'. Against the background of academic involvement with phenomena of popular music among youth and experiences made by the author in continuing education for music teachers, the changes, problems and limits of teaching about popular music in the school are addressed. In this process, our attention focuses on problems that result from the fact that popular music, as a cultural practice of teenagers, is a subtle method of socialization for adolescents. As a result, when current forms of popu- lar music are made the object of instructional activity, they can also create distances and thus lead to (unwanted) cultural disagreements in the classroom.

Abstract. Within the youth subculture of "gothic," elements of occultism, the romantic transfiguration of the Middle Ages and a preference for the morbid and fantastic horror stories are mixed together into a fascinating blend. The predominant color is black, as the expression of a melancholic and gloomy feeling towards life. In gothic music as well, gloom is represented through a mixture of styles, includ- ing gothic metal, medieval music and Celtic music. In a school in Germany, we developed a major theatrical project that dealt with a circle of themes revolving around death, expulsion and destruction. Poems and modern dance were selected as the means of expression. Book Reviews (Jonathan Stock, ed.) • Timothy Rice: "Steven M. Friedson. Dancing Prophets: Musical Experience in Tumbuka Healing.

Abstract : All of the papers address festival contexts to some extent, and papers by Brennan, Cohen, Cooley, and Titon center upon them. The paradigmatic example of the United States' Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife looms large, not only as the main focus of Jeff Titon's paper, but also in Stokes' concluding insights on tourism as pilgrimage. My own essay is on Cajun and zydeco music and dance in California, in which festivals play a relatively minor role. Nonetheless, it makes use of the Smithsonian Festival as a model for thinking about the roles of "visitors" and "participants." Although his field research took place far from the U.S., Timothy Cooley was similarly influenced by writings on the Smithsonian Festival in thinking about the relationships among organizers, participants, and tour- ists at a mountain festival in Poland. • Vicki L. Brennan: "Chamber Music in the Barn: Tourism, Nostalgia, and the Reproduction of Social Class," 11-29. Abstract : This paper considers the narrative strategies used by tourists attending a chamber music festival held on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. Such tourists use nostalgia to construct notions of "country folk," "classical music," and "life on the farm," constructions formed by political, cultural, and class struggles that may be found in many regions of the United States. By looking at the distinc- tions made between urban and rural places, people and things, I show how nostalgia and narrative work together with idealized visions of farm life to distinguish people, to put one group in their place while asserting the superiority of another, and to reinforce and maintain class distinctions. • Timothy J. Cooley: "Folk Festival as Modern Ritual in the Polish Tatra Mountains," 31-55. Abstract In this study, I interpret a large annual folklore festival in the Tatra Mountains of Poland as a modern ritual that is similar to more traditionally recognized calendric rituals. Key to my interpreta- tion of festivals is the local history of tourism and the emergence of the tourism as the region's major industry. I show how individuals from indigenous families of the Tatra region use tourist festivals to symbolically and ritually create, preserve, and represent their unique identity in the face of a changing world. • Mark F. DeWitt: Heritage, Tradition, and Travel: Louisiana French Culture Placed on a California Dance Floor," 57-83. Abstract. In the last ten to fifteen years what began as music-making and dance by a small enclave of Louisiana Creole immigrants nostalgic for their former homes has led to a disproportionate profusion of Cajun and zydeco dance music in urban northern California. Clifford's "traveling cultures" meta- phor provides a point of departure for viewing this phenomenon, the work both of immigrants and of cultural outsiders. Musical and dance practices contribute to "a sense of place" for all. In terms of "heritage" and "tradition" as Kirshenblatt-Gimblett has refined them, the scene for Louisiana French music and dance in California fulfills its heritage roles as reminder of the past for immigrants and "vir- tual tourism" for others, and it breaks through these roles when manifesting a new tradition. • Judith Cohen: "Constructing a Spanish Jewish Festival: Music and the Appropriation of Tradition," 85-113. Abstract : Over the past decades, a phenomenon of "discovering" hidden or "Crypto" Jewish communi- ties in Spain and Portugal has developed. While in a few cases, this has resulted in newly functioning Jewish groups, it has also led to the formation of imagined Jewish communities, celebrated by tourist itineraries and festivals, in others. The use of music as an appropriation and an identity marker in two imagined Iberian Jewish communities in Spain, and their festivals, is the main focus of this paper. It touches as well on some general issues: the anthropology of tourism, appropriation, authenticity, rep- resentation, and ownership. Underlying these issues is the ongoing question of whether considering representations such as those described here a cultural expression in their own right, is really respectful to the cultural practitioners themselves.

First, it seems helpful to take a brief look at recent developments in scholarly approaches to tourism's impact on both traditional arts and perceptions of authenticity and of history. One scholarly trend reflects a growing aversion to any anthropological statement which resembles a value judgment: changes, even outright inventions are not negative; they are transformations, or new cultural expressions. A different approach, much less apparent in anthropology and its related disciplines, deplores anything identifiable as a falsification of known facts, refusing it any new creative status. Thus, harnessing and reshaping memory may be seen in neutral, implicitly positive, terms by one group of scholars, and as reprehensible by another. • Jeff Todd Titon: "The Real Thing': Tourism, Authenticity and Pilgrimage among the Old Regular Baptists at the 1997 Smithsonian Folklife Festival," 115-39. Abstract'. In 1997 six Old Regular Baptists from southeast Kentucky demonstrated their traditional lined-out hymnody at the Smithsonian's Festival of American Folklife. The group's appearance there, timed to coincide with the release of an album on Smithsonian Folkways, was successful because they shared a common purpose with the festival organizers: they were "the real thing" and the power of their singing created a human community where before there only was an idea of one. Upon returning home, a member of their group wrote out their trip in response to a request from a member of her church. She framed their experiences in terms of travel, tourism, and pilgrimage. The Smithsonian Festival has been the focus of a small but growing critical literature from which this essay draws its discussions of authenticity, authority, reflexivity, folklore, and festival policy and administration. • Martin Stokes: "Music, Travel and Tourism: An Afterword," 141-55. Abstract : Discussing the articles in this special issue with reference to the more general literature on tourism and travel, the article presents tourism ethnomusicology as a challenging and complex field of study, indicating some of its breadth and diversity, and some of the possible directions in which it could go. It argues throughout for more nuanced ethnographic research, such as has emerged over the last de- cade in the anthropology of tourism, taking into account at least some of the motivations of actors and agents in tourist encounters and exchanges, and the specificities of music as a form of social engage- ment. The article focuses in particular on issues surrounding authenticity and representation, locality, nostalgia, work, leisure, the payment of musicians, and tourism as secular pilgrimage.

Abstract. Comparative analysis has always been a characteristic method in anthropological and ethno- musicological studies of Southeast Asia and Indonesia. One of the practical problems with this, how- ever, is the uneven distribution or simple lack of data for some of the cultures involved - in our case substantial recordings of dance, music and theatre. Although large areas of Indonesia remain uncov- ered, recordings are increasingly released outside the usual repertory of Central Javanese and Balinese gamelan or related court genres. These releases roughly can be divided in two categories. Best known is probably the ethnographical approach in which various genres of a particular group are presented in the form of a musical monograph. The second is a more thematic approach which disregards geo- graphical divisions and often provides surprising links that possibly function as an eye opener. • Nancy Wills: " Casta : I am Gypsy.

Since the rediscovery of traditional customs around 1900, "folk music" can be understood in the context of a preservation ideology as a reaction to the alleged weakening and dying out of old folk traditions. This was the period when the idea of Heimatschutz (protection of homeland) was born throughout Europe. Since the dawning of the modern period, with all its technical changes, many people have experienced certain disorientation. This confusion has also often been combined with the fear of losing regional identity. About one hundred years ago, it became clear that as a result of the increasing urbanization of the rural ways of life, traditional folk clothing was disappearing, all kinds of work done by hand were dying out, and "old" folk music was receiving little or no attention. A coun- termovement began that became particularly strong and longlasting in Bavaria. In a "restorative" man- ner, interest groups began to develop the idea of maintaining the "old" and the "good old times" with the intent of taking care of them, of cultivating them and of resurrecting them; the "old and beautiful values" would be preserved through associations and organizations. vol 41, 1999(2)</page><page sequence="97">2. Contents and Abstracts • 115 • Manfred Seifert: "Functionality and Aesthetic: On the Structural Principles of Traditional Folk Music and Their Transformation in the Bavarian 'Cultivation Movement'," 13-39. Abstract : Today in Bavaria, what is understood to be "traditional folk music" no longer has much in common with the popular music-making practices that prevailed among large segments of the popula- tion until the beginning of the 20th century. Since that time, earlier music-making styles have fallen to a large extent under the influence of the "cultivation" movement {Pflege). The current strict orientation toward Kunstmusik (art music) in folk music practice can be traced to the influence of this movement. In addition, the general social conditions of amateur music-making have been completely transformed. Examination of earlier times reveals a quite different logic of musical performance practice, which was consistently expressed in the repertoire, in the production of music and in the own forms of transmis- sion. Using a broad cultural-sociological approach, this article investigates these differences by de- scribing popular music practice mainly in the 1 8th and 1 9th centuries, with the intention of confronting Volksmusikpflege practices in the 20th century. • Franz Schötz: "'Cultivated' and 'Non-cultivated' Folk Music: On Music-making Among Traditional Dance Musicians in Bavaria," 41-61. Abstract : By orienting itself towards an academic-aesthetic sound ideal and thereby almost fully ignor- ing the music's original functions, the Bavarian folk music cultivation movement ( Volksmusikpflege ) has created, over the course of decades, a totally transformed sound in contrast to the original models. In the mid-1980s the own "Wilden im eigenen Land" (savages in one's own country) were discovered in the form of traditional village music ensembles. Such bands were based on strong family traditions which, until recent decades, dominated in Bavarian music-making. Using the example of a meter- shifting dance, the author investigates, with the help of detailed transcriptions, what distinguishes such traditional groups from the newer folk music (in this case, particularly brass music) cultivation groups. The traditional form of music-making, with its almost forgotten vitality, must simply be judged by its own standards. This does not mean uniform ensemble playing but rather it is the result of a unique mu- sicality acquired over many years that each individual musician brings to the ensemble. • Carsten Lenk: "'Cultivated' Folk Music - More Invention than Discovery? Appropriation and Mediation of Songs in East Bavaria," 63-97. Abstract. Folk music cultivation was long excluded as a field of study for music and song research because, as "simply folklorism," it did not seem worthy of special attention. In this article, I examine Volksmusikpflege in its working procedures and self-understanding, using a concrete case from East Bavaria. In doing so, it becomes clear that both written sources and the Bavarian Broadcasting Sta- tion have played an important role in Oberpfalz (East Bavaria) folk music cultivation since the end of Second World War. The concept of "folk song" that underlies this movement can be traced to Josef Pommer. Those active in folk music cultivation place singing and music-making against a larger social- critical background. In spite of all their emphasis on tradition, changes in stylistic elements and forms of interactions can also be recognized from about 1970 in the cultivation movement. • Heike Frey: "Traditional Urban Entertainment in Bavaria: The Volkssänger as Exemplified by Bally Prell," 99-122. Abstract : This article outlines the development of Munich Volkssänger from the middle of the 19th century to the late 1970s, portraying in the second section a particular artist of the post-war period. Volkssänger as entertainers in Munich experienced their heyday from approximately 1 880 to the 1 920s. This form of entertainment was not unsimilar to varieté (variety shows) but was strongly marked by regional characteristics; thematically, it took its topics from everyday life. One program typically in- cluded couplet songs, ensemble numbers, humoristic solo performances, one-act sketches and paro- dies. After the First World War, the mass media of movies, radio and later television changed the habits of audience reception, leading to the decline or else transformation of these forms of entertainment. Bally Prell (1922-1982), who had a beautiful tenor voice, was sensationally successful in 1953 as the "Beauty Queen of Schneizlreuth." Until her death, she was mainly identified with this song and this role and she was considered the inheritor of the Munich Volkssänger tradition. Her repertoire consisted,</page><page sequence="98">116 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) however, also of opera and operetta music, chansons and Lieder. To the present no monographic work on this singer has appeared; the biographical sketch laid out here is based upon interviews with her colleagues, friends, relatives and other witnesses of the time. • Josef Focht: "Denominational Roots of Swabian Amateur Music-making," 123-36. Abstract : Music composed and performed in Bavarian Swabia is strongly marked by its various de- nominational roots. This article reveals the underlying divergent developments between the time of the Reformation until around 1 800, using the examples of the Protestant Imperial cities of Memmingen and Kempten as well as the Catholic Ottobeuren and Kempten Abbeys. From 1 800 the Catholic and Protestant traditions begin to become more similar, and yet since then the Catholic components of the musical practice have been more strongly promoted both by state cultural policies as well as by the folk music cultivation movement ( Volksmusikpflege ) of the 20th century. • Johann Wax: "On Current Urban Dance Life in and Around Regensburg," 137-58. Abstract : Folk culture was first discovered and thematicized in central Europe from the beginning of the 19th century. This resulted in folk culture being idealized, stylized as a counterculture but above all, folk culture was isolated. Folk dance for example was no longer regarded as a part of everyday life but rather rose to the level of Kulturgut (cultural asset). This has been the case to the present. Reading the relevant literature on folk dance, one easily gains the impression that the described dance forms are still at their height of popularity because, other than folk dance, no other dance styles are mentioned. But actually, folk dance plays only a marginal role in German modern society. The constantly heard fear that it could completely disappear is not justified at the moment; this fear is perhaps explainable through the special history of Heimatpflege (cultivation of local traditions) and its mentality. • Armin Griebel: "The Discovery of Franconian Folk Song," 159-67. Abstract: During the 20th century, a pan-Franconian consciousness has formed within its three Bavar- ian districts (Upper, Middle and Lower Franconia), a consciousness that also includes the idea of a common folk music and an own Franconian folk song. Above all, Ditfurth's publication Fränkische Volkslieder from 1855 marked the conception of the Franconian folk song. The ideal image that he outlined through his selection of songs is corrected by the original song transcriptions of the same song collector. Since Volksliedpflege (folk song cultivation) cannot accept the present situation, with its living song tradition, as being worthy of "cultivation," two contrary alternatives emerge: the use of the Ditfurth songs as timeless, valid expressions of the Franconian folk song and/or the new creation of songs that, through choice of topic and use of dialect, can become bearers of identificatory values regarding Heimat (home, or local region).

Once nore, vari- ous authors confront the phenomenon of culturally specific hearing and listening from the perspectives of different cultural traditions. In this, they are making a connection with the fundamental idea of our earlier thematic volume on "Cultural Concepts of Hearing and Listening" (vol. 2/1997). Within the global dynamic of today, "hearing" the peculiarities and particularities of other cultural contexts is an indispensable prerequisite for future intercultural understanding. Intercultural understanding as- sumes the perception of difference and thus holds open the future. Hearing is in this sense a metaphor as well which fundamentally takes in and includes the Other and simultaneously implicates criticism on visual primacy.

Gay, Jr.: "Hearing is Seeing: Listening for New York Rock Musicians," 9-17. Abstract : This study shows that listening for local rock musicians in New York City depends upon more than just sound. It emerges as a rudimentary and paramount feature of their interactions with fel- low musicians that draws broadly upon a shared repertoire of communication modes, patterns, and ref- erents. Among these components, various sensorimotor activities associated with performance, espe- cially guitar performance, appear significant. Within the context of rehearsals, musicians listen in part to compose and refine their music. Here the guitar serves as a principal medium for communicating and developing musical ideas, dependent on both visual and aural modes. In this way, these rock musicians draw upon multiple modalities in listening to give meaning to the experience of musical sound. • Ben Brinner: "Cognitive and Interpersonal Dimensions of Listening in Javanese Gamelan Performance," 19-35. Abstract Taking the specific case of Central Javanese gamelan , this article considers how musicians listen in performance with emphasis on the highly context-dependent and socially situated nature of seemingly individual cognitive processes. Beginning with the conditions of performance and some of the more pervasive conventions evident in Javanese gamelan performance, the discussion turns to aural filtering and the differing experiences that musicians may have depending on the parts that they play, concluding with a demonstration of the integrated nature of interpersonal and cognitive aspects. The article draws on fieldwork conducted by the author in Central Java in 1982-83 and 1993 under the auspices of Fulbright fellowships as well as on other scholars' writing. • Gage Averill: "Bell Tones and Ringing Chords: Sense and Sensation in Barbershop Harmony," 37-51. Abstract : One of the principal goals of barbershop style harmony is the production of "ringing" chords ("bell tones," "expanded sound"), a harmonic phenomenon resulting from just intonation, a preference for dominant seventh chords, closely voiced chords ("close harmony"), and finely honed hearing/listening faculties, among other factors. This article explores the aesthetics of barbershop sing- ing and aspects of the listening experience, especially expanded sound, and relates them to ideology and worldview, gender relations, class and racial identities, and nostalgia in an attempt to understand how tones and acoustic sensation function at a symbolic level (the connection between sensation and sense). • Raúl R. Romero: "Aesthetics of Sound and Listening in the Andes: The Case of the Mantaro Valley," 53-58. Abstract : Peoples and cultures ascribe to the same acoustic sounds different social-related qualities, sentimental references and aesthetic values. In the central Peruvian Andes, for example, people per- ceive and value the sounds of the saxophone and clarinet in a different way from those living in other parts of the Andes. This article briefly describes how both instruments became popularized in the region during the present century and displaced older pre-Hispanic and colonial instruments. It also attempts to explain the social conditions which make possible the acceptance of "new" over "older" and local sounds. • Tim Becker &amp; Raphael Woebs: "'Back to the Future': Hearing, Rituality, and Techno," 59-71.

Contents and Abstracts • 119 Abstract : This briefly poses, but does not attempt to answer, the question of how Africans listen to the performance of instrumental music. Several statements from African musicians stress the importance of verbal texts in the content of the instrumental patterns and suggest that they may well listen in a dif- ferent way from the way Europeans do. Two recorded musical performances of Baganda and Basoga villagers are cited to show how readily a participating audience reacts to changes in musical patterning by changing the texts they sing. A short discussion of the music of hocketing trumpet ensembles further underlines the conceptual importance of verbal texts that form the kernel of such performances. • Rafael José de Menezes Bastos: "Apùap World Hearing: On the Kamayurá Phono- Auditory System and the Anthropological Concept of Culture," 85-96. Abstract : The Kamayurá are Tupian-Guarani and inhabit the Xingu Indian Park in Brazil. Living in two villages, they total 450 persons. This paper studies their phono-auditory system, showing its ecological and socio-cultural importance. The system is characterized by high potency, economy and agility, its categories having a basically monolexemical constitution, directly related to the relevance of the sound domain for the Kamayurá. Their verbs " anup " (hear) and " cak " (see) are ordered accordingly to a pat- tern called "axionomy," being degrees of a scale of values. This "world hearing" - extremely wide- spread in lowland South America - is contrasted with our visual gnosiology (world view), both being understood in terms of Mauss' notion of "body technique." Reflexion is made on the current debate on nature and culture in the lowlands and on theory of culture. • Max Peter Baumann: "Listening to Nature, Noise, and Music," 97-1 1 1 . Abstract : Creative listening is based on mental processes in the context of cultural differentiation. In terms of the synaesthetic relationship of the senses, human beings hear the background sounds of life in a corrective way, interpreting the sounds of nature and noises of technology based on their listening habits and traditions and placing them on a continuum between being like music and being a nuisance. With their culturally delimited habits, humans project themselves into sounds: from the cosmic breath and harmony of the spheres to the Big Bang, from noises in the uterus and music of the artificial world to the music of motorcycles. Listening structures, orders, creates, forms, compares, understands and misunderstands, interprets. It is not the world that makes our auditory contents but rather our experien- tial knowledge that creates the world and how we hear noise, nature, and music.

Articles • Svanibor Pettan: "Preface," 5-8. Abstract : The editorial concept of this volume is based on the idea of presenting Croatian musical cul- ture, including the phenomena being researched and the research itself. All the articles are related in various ways to (Croatian) folk music, which was widely recognized - until recently - in Croatia as the main subject of its own ethnomusicology. The authors, however, consider their scholarly realms as be- ing historical musicology (Ennio Stipčevic), ethnomusicology (Naila Ceribašic, Grozdana Maroševič), ethnochoreology (Tvrtko Zebec), and systematic musicology (Nikša Gligo). Stipcevic contextualizes the earliest notations of folk music in Croatia from the famous 16th-century poem by Petar Hektorovič; Ceribašic re-examines the "public sector activity" of many Croatian ethnomusicologists, that is, work related to folklore festivals, in the light of the controversies surrounding them; Maroševič describes the history of ethnomusicology in Croatia with emphasis on the concept of so-called folklore music; Zebec demonstrates that priests (in contrast to the common stereotype) in fact can play a positive and active role within the realm of a dance practice; and Gligo examines the national idiom based on folklore in a famous Croatian art music composition. The variety of their approaches is representative of the variety of music and music research in Croatia. The annotated bibliography prepared by Zdravko Blažekovič, which considers sources written by both Croatian and non-Croatian scholars in languages intelligible to a wide readership, provides easy access into music and music research in Croatia as a whole. • Ennio Stipcevic: "The Presence of the Past.

Contents and Abstracts • 121 folk music as faithfully as possible, others wanted to intervene as authors. In the church, under the influence of the Reformation and later the Counter-Reformation, tendencies emerged to single out the components of folk music that could be used for missionary and pastoral work. In the Baroque period transcriptions of Croatian folk music were no longer engrossed in the need for precision and faithful- ness. The Enlightenment could no longer reconcile the principles of faithfulness with its own ideology. So even today the "myth of otherness" is sometimes still paradoxically and a-historically present in attitudes toward the oldest notations of folk music and especially towards the folk history of "small nations" like Croatia. • Naila Ceribašic: "Folklore Festivals in Croatia: Contemporary Controversies," 25-49. Abstract : This article outlines and discusses the main controversies surrounding the contemporary festivals of Croatia. It starts with the basic aesthetic concept of autochthony and its critique contained in the discussions on folklore and folklorism and considers the points of disagreement and agree- ment between the scholarly and expert discourses of Croatian ethnomusicology. Finally phenomena are indicated which hint at a new paradigm of the public practice of folk art. The author argues that concepts such as tradition, heritage, autochthony and authenticity cannot be explained as the remnants of the past in the present. These are contemporary concepts and practices that rest upon the idea of the remnants of the past in the present. Therefore, the central controversy of today is Croatian folklore festivals lies not in what is being performed but who should be the permitted bearers and sanctioned connoisseurs of tradition. • Grozdana Maroševič: "The Encounter Between Folklore Studies and Anthropology in Croatian Ethnomusicology," 51-81. Abstract: The article provides an historical overview of the orientations and scopes of ethnomusicolo- gy in Croatia observed in the context of cultural, social and political circumstances. The central section of the article considers the creation of the so-called folkloristic paradigm of Croatian ethnomusicology, which was laid down in the mid-1970s under the influence of contextual (performative) folklore stud- ies. Furthermore, the result of applying this paradigm to research during the 1980s is evaluated. The implementation and gradual expansion of an ethnomusicology conceived in terms of folklore studies by means of broadening its concept of music from strictly folklore to any kind of music is presented in reference to the most recent undertakings of ethnomusicologists in Croatia. • Tvrtko Zebec: "Glagolitic Priests as Leaders of Chain-Round Dances on the Island of Krk," 83-97. Abstract : In this article, field research into dance events on the Island of Krk is augmented with the study of that island's history and identity, as well as the relations between the church and the people and social relations as a whole. The diachronic dimension of this research clearly reveals the rea- sons underlying the strict respect of the traditional social order among the population. The Glagolitic priests - their large numbers and high standing among the people - the ecclesiastical organization of life and the power of the church and its hierarchy have all played an important role in this social order. The island origins of the priests and the existing social norms did not hamper them from emphasizing their standing and position in society through dance as a particularly powerful non-verbal means of communication, while at the same time meeting their individual needs to express their feeling through movement - and not merely through words delivered from the pulpit. • Nikša Gligo: "Why Do We Like Symphonic Kolo? National Coloring and Its Articulation Through Folklore-based Idioms," 99-1 1 1 . Abstract : The main problem of adherents of the so-called "ideology of national orientation" is the relationship between the folkloristic and the artistic. In the piece entitled Symphonic Kolo, written during the height of that ideology, the composer Jakov Gotovac (1895-1982) does not use quotations from folklore, and this article investigates how he tried to resolve the folklore-art relationship. Goto- vac chose his material without any particular ethnomusicological interest, but simply according to his instinct. His compositional techniques comprise the processes of variation rather than of development. The elaboration of variational treatments are shown in some examples of his use of the basic cell, E-</page><page sequence="104">122 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) D-F-E-(D). This treatment also corresponds very well with endless transformations of the same in the kolo dance, as in the perpetually repetitive process of folk music. But the piece is, of course, not end- less; the composer's artistic instinct interrupts this process at the right moment. This is evidently an artistic creation of folk-like material without an identifiable source. • Zdravko Blažecovic: "A Bibliography of Writings on Music and Music Research in Croatia Published in Languages Other than Croatian," 1 13-79. Abstract : The present bibliographical selection aims to highlight easily available publications and to provide an introductory view to the music culture and music scholarship of Croatia. Although its fo- cus is on works dealing with Croatian topics, it also lists a selection of works produced by Croatian scholars examining other topics as well. Summaries accompanying the bibliographic entries which, when read individually, give the basic idea of particular works and together provide a brief overview of music research in Croatia. The bibliography is organized in six large categories, reflecting the clas- sification used by RILM Abstracts of Music Literature , in which a large number of abstracts for pub- lications issued in the 1980s and 1990s also originated. The categories are: (1) reference and research materials/state of music research; (2) general historical works; (3) works on individual musicians; (4) ethnomusicological works; (5) instruments; and (6) religious music.

Cooley: "Review Symposium: Shadows in the Field: New Perspectives for Fieldwork in Ethnomusicology , ed. by Gregory F. Barz and Timothy J. Cooley," 181-200. Abstract : The essays in Shadows in the Field address one of the key facets of ethnomusicological re- search, providing a stimulating set of reflections on fieldwork as experienced in a number of different settings. In reflection of the diversity of the book itself, a set of four responses has been commissioned. As will be apparent, responses involve a higher degree of personal reflection than standard reviews, and in place of the provision of a summary-evaluation of the book as a whole, each respondent has been encouraged to concentrate on only one or two fieldwork issues as developed inside or outside the pages of Shadows in the Field. Finally, the editors of the collection provide their own reflections upon the themes raised in these four responses. The essays in Shadows in the Field are: (1.) Casting Shadows in the Field : An Introduction, Timothy J. Cooley; (2.) (Un)doing Fieldwork: Sharing Songs, Sharing Lives, Michelle Kisliuk; (3.) Confronting the Field (Note) In and Out of the Field: Music, Voices, Text, and Experiences in Dialogue, Gregory F. Barz; (4.)

Abstract : The emphasis in this issue of the world of music is on how musical instruments help make musical, socio-cultural and political meaning, rather than how they are defined and conceptualized. The instruments are "old" in the sense of being part of pre-existing traditions and the contexts are "new" in the sense of being outside of "traditional" practices. The making of meaning with instru- ments has been characterized as: "offering] a special kind of materials memory, in its dual capacity of a physical body and its embodied acoustic identity. As a cultural product and also a tool to articulate cultural meaning through repeated sound, an instrument becomes a privileged site for retaining cultural memory" (Qureshi 1 997). While this characterization is useful as far as it goes, instruments are also be- ing used for re-building or re-inventing cultural memory. As such, they can help evoke and symbolize changes in "situated experience" such as the "construction of place" (Martin Stokes 1993). They can become a pivotal part of identity narratives and essential to experiencing and knowing sense through sound (Steven Feld 1996). • Raymond Ammann: "How Kanak is Kaneka Music? The Use of Traditional Percussion Instruments in the Modern Music of the Melanesians in New Caledonia," 9-17. Abstract : Kaneka is the contemporary and highly popular music of the young Melanesians in New Caledonia. The musicians say kaneka is the sound of their ancestors; their grandfathers on the other hand say there are not enough traditional elements in kaneka. Most of the traditional music of New Caledonia has been forgotten, and there is only a limited number of musical expressions from which the young musicians can take their ideas. The most evident link between kaneka and their grandfathers' music is the use of traditional percussion instruments. However, how percussion instruments accompa- vol. 40, 1998 (2)</page><page sequence="106">124 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) ny traditional singing and how they accompany kaneka music can show important differences. Perhaps the typical Melanesian element in kaneka lies not in the music itself but in the way the musicians treat kaneka as a cultural and political movement. • Karl Neuenfeldt: "Good Vibrations? The 'Curious' Cases of the Didjeridu in Spectacle and Therapy in Australia," 29-5 1 . Abstract The didjeridu dates back at least fifteen hundred years before present in northern Australia. In the last several decades, however, it has come to be used globally and nationally in contexts falling outside the parameters of local, "traditional" Aboriginal musical, socio-cultural, and spiritual practice. The contexts chosen for examination here are spectacle and therapy. I argue that Feld's formulation of a process of "schizophonia to schismogenesis" for how sounds can become distorted when split from their source can also be applied to musical instruments. What is of general interest is the interplay of the curious and the common in the rebirth, refashioning and re-contextual ization of a particular musical instrument (or any musical instrument for that matter) which not only helps make music but also helps socially construct and culturally produce meaning and value for those who play it, make it and hear it. What is of a more specific interest is how didjeriduisis are using the instrument in ways unforeseen even a decade ago. The didjeridu's trajectory as an instrument, icon and industry is both reflected in and shaped by indeterminant cultural appropriations which operate globally and are enacted primarily by non-Aboriginal people. • Don Niles: "The Conchshell Band as Preserver of German and Papua New Guinean Lutheran Traditions," 53-68. Abstract : Missionaries entering Papua New Guinea at the end of the nineteenth century expected their congregations to learn to sing European hymns properly. However, the results were often less than desired. German Lutherans greatly improved such singing through the innovative use of a traditional instrument, the conchshell trumpet, in ensemble. Today, amidst a phenomenal transformation to a hym- nody based on Papua New Guinea music, the conchshell band preserves German Lutheran hymnody. • Toru Seyama: "The Re-contextualization of the Shakuhachi ( Syakuhati ) and its Music from Traditional/Classical Into Modern/Popular," 69-83. Abstract The shakuhachi , a Japanese five-holed vertical bamboo flute, is today not only used in the traditional Japanese music but also featured in various genres of music such as jazz, pop, and rock. De- spite the simplicity of the instrument, the shakuhachi can create a rich and complex variety of sounds. It has also a unique historical background in which still exist many unsolved mysteries such as its origin, some religious legends, the lineages of transmission, and the process of dissemination/transformation. Having experienced drastic changes in the society since the Meiji Restoration more than 120 years ago, the Japanese are greatly influenced by the West and have modernized throughout the course of history. Although there are people who preserve generations-old traditions, most contemporary shakuhachi performers consider themselves to be free and not confined to restricted repertoires. With the cultural heritage on one hand and the infinite future on the other, the shakuhachi and the performers of the shakuhachi are in a stage of "re-contextualization." They are moving from traditional/classical into modern/popular, in search of the shakuhachi for tomorrow. • Thomas Turino: "The Mbira , Worldbeat, and the International Imagination," 85-106. Abstract This paper addresses the processes by which a localized indigenous African tradition, the mbira , rose to prominence at the national level in Zimbabwe after the 1 960s and became relatively widely diffused throughout the world after the 1970s. It is suggested that this instrument's fit with the mass media and cosmopolitan aesthetics, along with nationalism, were key to the mbira' s transforma- tion from a localist to a world tradition.

A Comparison of the Turning Points in History around the Years 1900 and 2000," 7-16. Abstract : Awaiting a turning point in history or the fear of changing times may find varying expres- sions through rituals (cf. Freud 1913, and Soeffner 1992). Both in everyday life as well as in the arts, a particularly critical turning point is circumvented through a kind of science fiction of the present. In addition, conservatism is emphasized to confront the impending future by insisting on an earlier, tradi- tional Weltanschauung in the society. Finally, a historical turning point is evaded through the return to ancient, archaic or else foreign or non-European rituals in the hope of finding a new future by means of a backward-looking orientation. The relevance of rituals to the present as forms of reaction to and anticipation of turning points in history and changing epochs will be examined by comparing Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps (1913) and forms of ritual music theater of the post-modern age in the 1 970s on the basis of its staging. In this context, the thesis is essential that on the one hand turning points announce themselves, according to Hans Blumenberg (1966), as clusters and accelerations of processes, as failed revolutions and changes that are heralded long before the definite "turn." On the other hand, retreat out of abrupt change will only take place if the post-modern age, which is itself a symptom of crisis due to change, is extinguished and worked through. Comparison of the two changes of epochs shows at the fin de siècle of the last century a larger proportion of projections for the future, while the present turn towards the year 2000 is characterized by a stronger orientation toward archaic rituals and tradition. • Hans-Peter Köpping: "Ritual Transgression between Primitivism and Surrealism: Tauromachia and the Ethnographic Imagination," 17-35. Abstract : From the turn of the century, European artists have taken "tribal art" pieces, in particular African sculptures, as inspiration to revolutionize those stylistic conventions that they perceived as obsolete. The whole movement of "primitivism" focused on the exotic forms of tribal art, which were taken out of their context of creation and usage as well as meaning and imputed with values consid- ered lacking in Western civilization. Exotic art production was perceived as being close to the origins of human creativity and a direct expression of emotive and psychic states. Pieces which were usually used in their indigenous context in religion and ritual were now re-interpreted according to European aesthetic needs. In 1937, however, Michel Leiris, who followed most of the European artistic innova- tions, approached the corrida of Spain, one of the surviving "primitive" mass spectacles of Europe, in an anthropological spirit. While imbuing it with his own notions of eroticism, he developed in his Tauromachia a genuinely innovative theory of ritual which found strong resonance in the ideas of other members of the surrealist movement around the unorthodox "college de sociologie," such as Georges Bataille and Roger Caillois. All three concentrated on the idea of ritual as transgressive mode in rela- tion to the normative social order. Through his analysis of the corrida as a transgressive ritual that in his opinion combines notions of death and the erotic, Leiris also developed a particular notion of the aesthetic as being inherently and necessarily connected to the presence of a "blemish," a transgressive rupture, an idea which, as this essay argues, has affinities with the artistic understanding of Picasso as expressed in a number of productions which culminate in the "Guernica" of the same year (1937). The essay closes with a tentative connection between the European search for re-invigorating artistic expressions through a return to the "imagined primitive" and Leiris' attempt at ethnographic work that puts the researcher's self into focus. • Gabriele Brandstetter: "Ritual as Scene and Discourse: Art and Science Around 1900 as Exemplified by Le Sacre du printemps ," 37-59.

In this constellation, in reference to the ritual as cultural pattern - indeed both equally as scene and as discourse - , a reflection reveals itself which achieves its representation in the choreography of Le Sacre du printemps. At the same time, this reflection marks a break with the traditional constitution of space and conception of the body of classical ballet. • Martin Zenck: "Ritual or Imaginary Ethnography in Stravinsky's Le Sacre du printemps 61-78. Abstract : In earlier interpretations of Le Sacre du Printemps , Stravinsky research has one-sidedly char- acterized the ritual in terms of the subject of the scenario by Nikolai Roerich and the choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky, the latter of which has been recently reconstructed by Millicent Hodson. The fol- lowing essay assumes that Stravinsky expressly distanced himself from a conception for the ballet that referred to plot and subject in order to abstractly execute the ritual in the music itself. Sacre' s time structure was created in such a way that the contradictions of liminal periodicity and excessive illud tempus ("that [closed off] time") as structurally characteristic of the ritual are mirrored by Stravinsky in a correspondingly artificial way. If in deliberating this latter point the choreography of Nijinsky is brought into consideration, then only in order to illuminate the shift of emphasis of this essay from self-sacrifice to the murder of the Chosen One. Contrary to many interpretations, Stravinsky did not archaically revive ritual in the Sacre of 1913. Further, in his criticism of the sacrificial practice of ritual we see conspicuous parallels to Freud's analysis of totemism that was formulated in the same year as Stravinsky composed this ballet. • Kay-Uwe Kirchert: "Between Worlds: Reflections on Ritual in the Music of Giacinto Scelsi," 79-100. Abstract : The manner by which Scelsi applies ritual to his compositions lies in the reduction or concen- tration of musical means of expression. Scelsi 's improvised approach to music lends his compositions or settings an authenticity which seems, through their reduction, to exist in a cultural no man's land. In doing so, he takes on a certain mediative function between cultures, a function which removes itself from standardized criteria of evaluation. In addition to Scelsi, this article also cites concrete examples from the visual arts and from literature that offer comparable approaches which, within their respective genres, also create new perspectives with known or generally applicable magnitudes of reference. • Gerhard Neumann: "Iphigenia: Sacrifice and Ritual in Drama," 101-17. Abstract : Using the example of the Iphigenia myth, two theses are presented here referring to the ritual sacrifice and its cultural function: the thesis of the origin of Greek tragedy from the sacrificial ritual and the complementary thesis of the Occidental tragedy as organ of a casuistic of sacrifice and its function in the development of culture. The myth of Tantalus and one of its most important derivatives, the story of Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia, play a key role in European culture. In Iphigenia's story, the mo- tives of the victim and of Anagnorisis converge, thus of a social taming of surplus anarchic violence on the one hand and of an extraction of nomologie knowledge on the other. In the development of material from both "Iphigenias" of Euripides to Goethe's Iphigenia in Tauris , the metamorphosis of human to animal sacrifice in symbolic action, and thus in language as medium of communication, follows: as a way from archaic ritual sacrifice to a utopia of humane understanding. • Tobias Fichte: . don't you think this could become a new kind of cantata?' Rituality, Authenticity and Stage-Setting in Mendelssohn's Walpurgisnacht , 119-34. Abstract : Assuming a potential analogy between art and ritual, or between art and the interpretation of ritual as a Gesamtkunstwerk , the question arises as to what degree boundaries or transitions between aesthetic presentation, staging, and identification with ritual can be determined in art. This topic could be discussed in terms of reception-aesthetics, with the question of the participation of an implicit or exclusive audience in ritual or in art. On the other hand, the perspective of this question can also be developed, as in this article, in terms of production-aesthetics, using the model of a musical composi- tion based on a preexisting literary text. In Goethe's and Mendelssohn's "texts," not only their cultic- religious rituality will be investigated, but also the problem of how far beyond the cultic subject the</page><page sequence="110">128 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) immanent formative principles of ritual in terms of music are effective. Although in his early ballad "Die erste Walpurgisnacht" (The First Walpurgis Night) of 1799 Goethe distinguished the "pagan" Walpurgis night from the "classical" and "romantic" in both stages of Faust, in his own way Men- delssohn related these three forms of ritual directly to one another within one work. • Tony Langlois: "The Gnawa of Oujda: Music at the Margins in Morocco," 135-56. Abstract : This paper describes some of my fieldwork encounters with the Gnawa, a group of ethnic minority musicians living in Oujda, north-eastern Morocco, where I conducted research in 1994. I recount how I met the group and some impressions of the places where they lived and worked. After discussing the structure and nature of the musical events through which they interacted with the rest of the population, I describe their instruments and comment upon their repertoire. The economic and political circumstances in which the Gnawa appear to live are considered, and I offer an explanation as to why women comprise the greater part of their audience. Returning to the performance itself, I observe its most dramatic high point, a gestured self-mutilation, which both raises the level of excite- ment of the event and serves to reinforce the belief in the Gnawa's supernatural powers. Finally, the relationships between Gnawi music, local saintly figures, and color are discussed. I conclude that the group's precarious economic and social niche depends upon their manipulation of their "otherness," the maintenance of secrecy surrounding their practices, and the need of local women for the catharsis their rites allowed.

Abstract : Wedding songs maintain traditional musical and poetic forms while also belonging to a per- manent process of renewal and adaptation that has continued over centuries. The actual forms they take on in individual cultures, regions and ethnic areas are constructed in highly differentiated ways and depend on the current condition of the wedding tradition itself. Looking at the central European region, a gradient can be distinguished in the wedding song repertoire: in the direction of Eastern Europe, it is more extensive, towards the west; the repertoire is considerably more limited. Functional differen- tiation determines the richness of wedding songs, which are also influenced by religious differences within the central European region. • Janet Sturman: "Movement Analysis as a Tool for Understanding Identity: Retentions, Borrowings, and Transformations in Native American Waila ," 51-69. Abstract : This article explores the role of body movement in defining musical style and group affilia- tion in situations in which music helps define identity. Two musical styles of popular dance music in the American Southwest, Native American waila and Mexican American norteño music are compared and contrasted. These styles share roots and many performance practices but have developed to serve and represent different groups of people. Body movement, for performers as well as for the dancers who respond to the music, is one of the clues to meaningful differences between these styles. Attention to movement also offers insights into how waila musicians in particular are changing to reach wider con- stituencies. The author draws on several years of fieldwork, involving firsthand observation of musical performances and many interviews with participants, and on work by Baily, Blacking, and Van Zile, among others, regarding movement analysis in musical performance. • Andreas Michel: "Changes in Central European Concepts of Folk Musical Instruments: Industrially Produced Zithers without Fingerboards," 71-90. Abstract: Since about 1 885 zithers without fingerboards have been distributed in Germany, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries around the world by the musical instrument industry. Particu- larly until 1940, such zithers were sold in extraordinarily large numbers under the names of "guitar zither," "autoharp," "violin zither," "mandolinette zither," "pianochordia," etc. These instruments, de- signed for the amateur musician who could not read notation, were to serve a new form of folk music and had a concept of distribution and reception that had been worked out on a commercial basis. This acted within the area between the contrasting poles of transmitted middle-class forms of musical didac- tics and recent forms of folk music practice. • Yang Mu: "On Musical Instruments of the Li Poeple of Hainan (China)," 91-112.

However, the musical culture of the Li remains a little studied subject. This article is an attempt to help fill this gap. It focuses on the indigenous musical instruments of the Li. I first depict the major types of instruments, then examine their traditional social and symbolic functions, and finally discuss an issue of identity in light of current changes involving these instruments and their functions.

Hindustani and Karnatak performers began interacting primarily through the intermediation of brothers Uday and Ravi Shankar. The former, through his fa- mous dance Company in the 1930s, brought such musicians together and into contact with other Asian traditions (e.g., Southeast Asian) influenced by India. From the 1940s Ravi Shankar prominently in- corporated Karnatak ragas , talas, and improvisational techniques into his strongly rooted Hindustani sitar tradition. The Shankars' international concert tours laid the groundwork for subsequent world music fusions.

Abstract : The article approaches the acoustical environmental problem that in large cities is ever- present on all street corners, evoking lively sounds. These are the many "imposed musical events" which often make people victims of involuntary hearing. And still, from the time one "comes into the world" one is accompanied by noise. Noise and sounds mean being here on earth, life, enjoyment of life, hearing the fiesta of life, forgetting oneself and exuberance. On the other hand, involuntary subjec- tion to musical events in the private and public spheres also creates inner tensions and conflicts of large proportions, as witnessed in correspondence to a Barcelona newspaper. • John Chernoff: "'Hearing' in West African Idioms," 19-25.

Abstract : In the electronic age "hearing and seeing" relates to the transcultural dynamic of modern times. A general change in listening behavior can be observed. These changes are historically rooted on the one hand in Western notated music and on the other in the more recent globalized recording in- dustry and the visualization of music that has resulted from the electronic media. Still, in intercultural comparison made by interviews of Malaysian and Californian students, different attitudes of hearing and listening can be determined. • Wim van Zanten: "Inner and Outer Voices: Listening and Hearing in West-Java," 41^9. Abstract : In West Java listening is differentiated: On the one hand listening belongs to the "outer voice" (lahir) as manifestation of music, on the other hand music, dance, and theater are the outer manifesta- tions of inner life, the "inner voice" ( batin ) of a societal and cosmic order. • John Baily: "Afghan Perceptions of Birdsongs," 51-59. Abstract : Bird songs are understood as a kind of language in which the birds praise Allah.

Abstract. The thematization of the perception of traditional music ( kugak ) and Western music {yangak ) in Korea is taken up by this article. If traditional music is full of perfect virtue (in) or life energy (ki), then it is the basis for perceiving Western music connected to a rational-aesthetic construct. New com- positions evolve out of the syncretism of kugak and yangak , compositions which raise for once new questions of perception to its listeners. • Amy Catlin: "Puzzling the Text: Thought-Songs, Secret Languages, and Archaic Tones in Hmong Music," 69-8 1 .

Abstract : The postmodern, multicultural society confronts contemporary youth with a diversity of hearing situations. Analyses, using empirical data on attitudes, inform about the listening behavior of teenagers in Austria, particularly with regard to rock and pop music. Music is heard individually and in groups. An increasingly individual selection of that which is heard marks the personal and also dif- ferentiated musical behavior of youths, also in reference to their groupings according to age, interests, and ethnic self-understanding. • Ursula Hemetek: " Šunen , Šunen, Romalen (Listen, Listen, Roma): Reception of Lovari Songs - A Cultural Misunderstanding?" 97-110. Abstract'. How difficult communication between minority Roma musicians and the majority of Aus- trian audiences examines this article using Lovari Songs which, in the context of performance for Roma themselves have a totally different significance as for a German-speaking Austrian audience. In the intercultural process between understanding and misunderstanding, both musical behavior and the repertoire of the Roma as well as the listening behavior of the non-Roma modify themselves in creative ways. • Jürgen Eisner: "Listening to Arabic Music," 1 1 1-26. Abstract. How difficult it is to approach the musical context of another culture in order to enculturate an adequate ability to hear is shown through his article. Western listeners must involve themselves in- tensively with the musical parameters of Arabic musical concepts such as melodic form, tonal norms and rhythmic structures in order to free themselves from Eurocentric listening and to acquire a cultur- ally adequate, comprehending level of hearing. • Jean During: "Hearing and Understanding in the Islamic Gnosis," 127-37. Abstract : In the Islamic culture, reflections on hearing in general as well as on listening to music or to speech developed together with Sufism, mysticism and theology. However, this specific relationship is not only limited to the comprehension and interpretation of the listening process. On the one hand the myths and significant anecdotes are also open to other interpretations, such as those of a psychologi- cal or phenomenological nature. On the other hand, the philosophy of perception - notably visual and auditory - , which is open to larger theosophical perspectives, is deeply anchored in experience. Mys- ticism and Sufism are not speculative paths but rather theological or metaphysical interpretations of those experiences that possess a particularly intensive and special quality. Within these interpretations, experiences that are witnessed through vision and listening occupy an important position in mysti- cism, in gnosis and in the esoteric sciences. Vision particularly refers to the "imaginative" world and is hardly taken into account as part of the world of the senses, since in the Islamic gnosis there is no meditation on icons, mandalas or plastic forms. Contrary to this, hearing is the other fundamental axis to Revelation; it was privileged as a kind of contemplation, particularly in relation to the Sufi practice of samã a spiritual concert.

Abstract: Through their specific examples, the articles of this volume can provide only a small glimpse into the numerous possible healing and therapy concepts that use music or music-related actions. Through their own world-view constructs, each society defines differently what health and illness are. Thus concepts of therapy have developed which are accordingly diverse. Since early times, music as a tool for healing or for therapy has played a more or less important role in many societies. Among mythic-magical conceptions, shamanistic practices and ideas of cosmological or religious healing and harmony, the wide spectrum varies between conceptions that either attribute a healing effect to the physical sound energy of music itself or conceptions by which the healing power of a mediator/healer first becomes effective through the vehicle of music. • Tiago de Oliveira Pinto: "The Healing Process as Musical Drama: Remarks on the Ebó Ceremony in Bahian Candomblé (Brazil)," 1 1-33.

Periodic enactments of the ritual allow people to create and recreate their community, their identity and their links to the past. The meanings embedded in the mesa are articulated in performance, providing an important arena for understanding the way in which past and present meet, how illness is perceived, and how social conflicts within the community are negotiated and resolved. • Patricia Moffitt Cook: "Sacred Music Therapy in North India," 61-83. Abstract : This article identifies and examines "sacred music therapy" among Hindu village healers in North India. Descriptions of Hindu village life and of two healers and their health care facilities are interwoven, followed by a description of a complete healing session. Each stage of the therapeutic pro- cess is described, analyzed within its cultural context, and then discussed in transcultural terms. In con- clusion a comparison is made between "sacred music therapy" in North India and contemporary West- ern music-centered therapy, focusing on the disappearance of the sacred and spiritual aspects of healing in the latter. Hindu village healers, who employ music, in addition to other traditional healers, warrant investigation before they disappear. This article is an attempt to stimulate further dialogue and research in North Indian traditional music therapy as well as other indigenous music healing traditions. • Takefusa Sasamori: "Therapeutic Rituals Performed by Itako (Japanese Blind Female Shamans)," 85-96.

Abstract : In music therapy, the sound experience is understood as an archaic element beyond culture. The method of analytically oriented music therapy works with free improvisation in the creation of treatment in teamwork between therapist and patient. The process of therapy involves understanding these products and working out the problematic of the relationship. A qualitative method for describing and comprehending these interactive musical works was developed through the concept of "resonator function" {Resonanzkörperfunktion). This concept refers to the ability of all participants to perceive meaning that is affective and characteristic of relationships. To reconstruct motives, the treatment pro- cess will be presented in a case study, and the necessity for research on this kind of primary experience that results from action will be elucidated. • Dorit Amir: "Understanding The Role of Folksongs in Jewish-Israeli Culture: Implications for Music Therapy," 1 1 1-27. Abstract Since the earliest times in history, different cultures throughout the world have used songs as a healing force. To understand the role of Israeli folk songs in music therapy, we need to examine Jewish cultural roots. In the Jewish culture, singing has always been the main means for connecting with the depths of the soul. In modern Hebrew culture, Israeli folk songs play a crucial role in creating a spiritual bond between the people and the country, thus strengthening national as well as self-identity. Shirei zikaron , or memorial songs, form a part of this song repertoire. These songs are broadcasted on Israeli radio during the nation's memorial days and when national tragedies occur, thus creating both a special atmosphere of sadness and a sense of national unity.

Abstract : Revival of folk culture, whether seen as a continuous process or as the goal of sporadic, orga- nized movements, has played an important role in European cultural life for the past two centuries and more. Intertwined with nostalgia for a simpler past and rebellion against a fast-changing, complicated present, the propagation of presumably ancient folk music and dance has been supported by European intellectuals since the times of Herder and Rousseau. Their direct linkage of folk culture with "the old" and with "the good" in small-scale societies served in the 19th century to support nationalistic sentiments, a trend that can still be witnessed today. At the same time, "revived" folk music and dance began to receive structural support from organized groups that set down specific criteria for evaluating their art, thus forcing a conservative, regressive pattern on a cultural form that had always changed and developed. As the images of what constituted "the old" or "authentic" became more stereotyped and clichéd, counter-reactions arose (as in the 1960s in Western Europe) that attempted to blend folk culture into that of the mainstream. On the whole, however, such efforts simply emphasized the artifi- ciality of this process vol. 38, 1996 (3)</page><page sequence="118">136 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Owe Ronström: "Revival Reconsidered," 5-20. Abstract : The article attempts to overview and discuss some basic traits in the literature on musical revival. Revival of musical forms and styles is an important and wide spread phenomenon that has been studied from a large number of perspectives. Tentatively, the literature can be divided into two main parts, one object-oriented and centering around questions of authenticity, the other process-oriented and centering on revival as symbolic expressions. A large part deals with revival of traditional music. The author argues that in essence revival is a process of traditionalization that goes on in the present, to create symbolic ties to the past, for reasons in the future, and that since such processes is not con- fined to traditional music only, it is now necessary to study and compare also revivals of other musical genres and forms. • Marianne Bröcker: "Folk Dance Revival in Germany," 21-36. Abstract : This paper provides a short survey of the development of folk dancing in Germany during the 20th century and describes the current folk dance situation in western Germany. Very different kinds of dance activities and events have resulted from the political and cultural history of our country during the past century. In addition, the long-lasting continuity of several organizations that were founded to preserve and cultivate traditions of former times and their activities over the past twenty years are of particular interest because of the gradual modifications of interest in dancing and the shift in direction towards a kind of multicultural dance movement. • Jadranka Važanová-Horáková: "Transformation of Folk Music Traditions in the Villages around Bratislava, Slovakia," 37-50. Abstract : Despite their location near the capital of Slovakia, some former villages in the present sub- urbs of Bratislava have preserved to the present various folk music traditions. These traditions are on the verge of disappearing, as their original carriers grow old and die, but are also being revived and interpreted in a transformed way by folk ensembles. This paper focuses on how this transformation has come about in terms of the changes in context, singing occasions, musical structure, repertory and performance. • Oskár Elschek: "Research on Stylistic Areas of Slovak Instrumental Folk Music," 5 1-69. Abstract : Though closely related to vocal forms, instrumental folk music in Slovakia possesses its own, specific characteristics and functional, social and socio-psychological relations. This paper addresses musical identification and stylistic characterization through the acoustical analysis of aerophones and chordophones, and by raising questions that consider socially, historically and culturally related fac- tors. The concept of Tonigkeit proves useful to characterize the sound styles of instrumental folk music, complemented by the concept "sound theory" to approach the musical-structural parameter. • Max Peter Baumann: "Folk Music Revival: Concepts between Regression and Emancipation," 71-86. Abstract The musical behavior of folklore groups towards their environment is marked by conflicting models. On the one hand such groups tend in a historicizing way to try to revive the past using the most "authentic" forms possible (concept of cultivating the original "old"). At the same time, involvement with the modern is a transcendence of old concepts in that the local is syncretically blended together with new ideas (concept of fusioning the "old" and "new"). The dynamic of tradition lies precisely in the musical relationship between local and global perspectives, regression and emancipation, and be- tween retrospection and future outlooks.

Abstract: The focus of this volume is the ethnomusicological exploration of sources for the study of performance practice in historical traditions. For two of the authors (Stillman and Spiller), the sources are recordings as well as recent field research. For the other two authors (Lam and Wade) the sources are primarily historical - musical notations and a tradition of musical scholarship on the one hand and miniature paintings on the other hand. The geographical areas of the essays span the Pacific Rim - Hawaii, Indonesia (specifically West Java), China, and India. The periods considered cover many cen- turies: the 1 2th- 1 3th centuries, the 1 6th- 1 7th centuries, and the 19th century to the present. In each case, however, our understanding is deepened of music as performed today in these areas. • Amy Ku'uleialoha Stillman: "Sound Evidence: Conceptual Stability, Social Maintenance, and Changing Performance Practices in Modern Hawaiian Hula Songs," 5-21.

Musical sounds materialize the practices through which they are produced. By interrogating practices in time, and ways in which those practices are maintained and conceptual- ized over time, I demonstrate the clarity that sound evidence can offer to historical interpretation of multiple temporalities in musical repertoire, concepts, and practices. In the case of modern Hawaiian hula songs, changes in practices do not necessarily correspond with changes in conceptualizations, and vice versa. Findings are based on aural analysis of commercial recordings that date from 1905, field recordings from the 1920s and 1930s, oral testimony, and documentary evidence of song classifica- tions. • Henry Spiller: "Continuity in Sundanese Dance Drumming: Clues from the 1893 Chicago Exposition," 23-40. Abstract : Even a casual observer of modern Sundanese dance is struck by the dose correspondence between the dancer's movements and the sounds of the kendang (a set of barrel-shaped drums). The kendang player provides each dance gesture with an audible component. In modern dance forms, the dance/drum relationship takes the form of a repertory of stereotypical movement patterns, each with a specific corresponding drum pattern. It is generally thought that the dose correspondence between dance movements and kendang patterns is an essential and ancient characteristic of Sundanese dance; many village dance traditions (usually acknowledged as ancient) exhibit analogous movement/sound relationships. Contemporary Sundanese dance, however, is a purely 20th-century product. Inspired by changing social and political contexts, prominent choreographers created new genres and works based not only on traditional Sundanese material but on materials gathered elsewhere as well; their work forms the nucleus of modern Sundanese dance. The paucity of reliable information about Sundanese music before 1900 makes it difficult to ascertain the Sundanese models with which these choreogra- phers began; it cannot be taken for granted that the paradigms of modern choreography predate these choreographers. Some remarkable wax cylinder recordings made in 1893 by B.I. Gilman in the Java village theatre at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago shed some serendipitous light on the issue. Gilman's notes and spoken comments while recording Sundanese musicians accompanying a dance performance enable the researcher to map specific kendang patterns to specific character types; comparison of these kendang patterns to modern patterns for similar situations demonstrates a 100- year continuity in several specific aspects of Sundanese dance drumming. • Bonnie C. Wade: "Performing the Drone in Hindustani Classical Music: What Mughal Paintings Show Us to Hear," 41-67. Abstract. This paper explores the history of the adoption of a regional performance practice in Indian music - the use of an instrument solely for the purpose of continuously sounding a drone - into the court music of the Mughal dynasty and thence into North Indian classical music as we know it today. The primary source utilized in this study is visual: miniature paintings produced in the 16th and 17th centuries for the imperial patrons Akhar and Jahangir. After some general observations on recent schol- arly thinking about the history of the drone in Indian music, information gleaned from the paintings is presented. Finally, a possible explanation is offered for the emergence of the West Asian tambür as the instrument for the continuous keeping of the drone. • Joseph S.C. Lam: "Transnational Understanding of Historical Music: State Sacrificial Music from the Southern Song, China (A. D. 1 127-1279)," 69-83. Abstract : Traditional Chinese music historians and performers reconstruct historical music interpre- tively, a practice that is quite different from modern and positivist pursuit of authentic sounds and per- formance practices. By providing an indigenous means to understand Chinese historical music, and by suggesting a solution to the fondamental problems of imagining and hearing historical music which is not minutely described in documents, the Chinese practice appears as viable and necessary.

It is with plea- sure that we take this occasion to warmly congratulate him in the name of the International Institute for Traditional Music, the Romani P. E.N. Center and our readers and authors. In his various capacities as an inspired musician, a cultural philosopher, manager and wise advisor, Lord Menuhin has repeat- edly and energetically stood up for the important concerns of small minorities, just as he also stands convincingly for democratic issues in the context of the diversity and plurality of the cultures of the world. His ceaseless commitment to the richness of different concepts of reality, to the values of other cultures and to the recognition of alternative traditions in music, philosophy, literature and art reveals the true greatness of his own intercultural thinking and behavior. As a propagator of direct dialogue between cultures, he is especially dedicated to "lending a voice to the voiceless." Of special concern to him are the voices of the Roma and Sinti, to whom he refers repeatedly in his public statements and in his autobiographical reminiscences, and for whose rights and recognition he fights in the community of nations. Five articles illuminate from various perspectives the dynamic topic of Roma identity and the role of Gypsy music and the Gypsy musician in the societies of yesterday and today. Within a range both of ethnic and cultural as well as of regional, national and international oppositions, a common background is revealed in all articles: the historically difficult road of intercultural encounter within the environment of prejudice, stereotypes and clichés, though at the same time the countless hopes for an enriched future of living together. This future would consist of breaking through borders and founding the true multicultural society of tomorrow, a society which - in contrast to all lessons of exclusivity - must always reflect - in a cognitive, theoretical sense - on the Other together with the constitutive Own, and vice versa. • Rudolf M. Brandl: "The 'Yiftoi' and the Music of Greece: Role and Function," 7-32. Abstract : Professional folk music of the Balkans is unthinkable without the contributions made by Romany and Sinti musicians. In Albania and Greece these musicians are called "Yiftoi" (from eyiftoi = "Egyptian"). Under the Ottomans, they succeeded the Spaniol Jews as professional urban musicians in musical function, repertoire and style, and performance practice. Due to the Yiftoi and to the musical reforms they supported the traditional music of Albania and Greece has survived, remaining a living musical heritage. Besides the shadow theater karagöz , it is first and foremost in the two instrumental ensembles koumpaneia (Greek )lsaze (Albanian) (clarinet, violin, lute, and drum) on the one hand, and the davul-zurna ensemble (drum and oboe) on the other, where Romany and Sinti musicians play an active role. Descriptions of their music and dance forms can be found as early as the 1 9th century in travelogues describing the court of Ali Pascha in Ioannina. • Svanibor Pettan: "Gypsies, Music, and Politics in the Balkans: A Case Study from Kosovo," 33-61. Abstract. The author examines the adaptability of Gypsy musicians in one of the multiethnic, politi- cally tense regions in the Balkans. This adaptability is examined with regard to instrumentation, reper- toire, and manner of performance. All adaptive strategies point to the cosmopolitan position of Gypsy musicians. Their adaptability appears to be a creative process in which improvisatory treatment of ele- ments of various origins plays an important role. The results of the comparison of musical data match those of the comparison of extra-musical ones, thus suggesting that variation as the outcome might be a prominent feature not only of Gypsy musicianship in Kosovo, but also of the Kosovo Gypsy culture. • Carol Silverman: "Music and Power: Gender and Performance among Roma (Gypsies) of Skopje, Macedonia," 63-76. Abstract : Based on research from 1990-1994 in Shuto Orizari, a Rom neighborhood of Skopje, Mace- donia, this paper analyzes the role of music and other performance arts such as dance, food, and cos- tume in creating cultural and political identities. Music and dance are shown to be gendered forms of power in two realms: within the Romani community at family rituals such as weddings and circumci- sions, and in Rom/non-Rom interactions such as political gatherings and folk festivals. The relation- ship between economics, politics, and the expressive domain is emphasized.</page><page sequence="123">2. Contents and Abstracts • 141 • Katalin Kovalcsik: "Roma or Boyash Identity?

The third part highlights the stylistic groups of the folk music of a selected subgroup, the Ard'elans.

Abstract : This article deals with the construct of the Gypsy reflection in the mirror of the classical European musical tradition. Since the 15th century an idealizing and romanticizing tendency has con- trasted against the history of persecution and expulsion of the Roma. This tendency is reflected above all in the female Gypsy stereotypes of Preciosa (Cervantes), Mignon (Goethe), Esmeralda (Hugo) and Carmen (Merimée) in Singspiele and operas. The European "Gypsy mode" in instrumental music began with the compositional adaptation of verbunkos. Liszt and Brahms paved the way for a new ro- mantic kind of pseudo-Gypsy music. Albéniz, Granados, de Falla, Ravel, Halffter, Rodrigo and many others broadened the range with Andalusian or impressionistic Gypsy genres.

Abstract : This paper explores what I call the acoustic intuition of musicians of "whispered inanga a genre of music performed in Burundi. At the center of whispered inanga is a complicated auditory illusion, whose mechanics are revealed only through intense acoustic analysis. Nevertheless, both mu- sicians and well-exposed listeners appear to have an intuitive understanding of the operating of this illusion. This understanding is demonstrated by means of metaphor, as used by musicians and listeners to discuss performance technique, perception of the music, and traditions associated with the genre. The paper examines two kinds of metaphors: spontaneous metaphors, which occur in the midst of con- versation and are keenly insightful on single aspects of the genre or its performance; and conceptual metaphors, which reveal through particular linguistic construction the basic competitive nature on which the inanga illusion is based. The paper ends with a discussion of a prominent legend of recent history which captures the inanga illusion in narrative form. • Gordon E. Smith: "Ernest Gagnon's Chansons populaires du Canada: Processes of 'Writing Culture'," 36-65. Abstract : The author proposes links between Gagnon's historic 19th-century French Canadian folk- song collection Chansons populaires du Canada and postmodern notions of' "writing culture." Smith advances the idea that Gagnon was indeed doing ethnography in the Chansons populaires and explores the collection through an examination of its historical context; fieldwork and transcriptions; structural aspects; and Gagnon's plainchant-folksong hypothesis, with its linkage of a musical system (modality) and morality Throughout the article suggestions for resonances between historical and current vantage points are engaged - resonances that might suggest other readings and reinterpretations of the text's dominant voices. Considered as a study of music in/as culture, Gagnon's work may well be added to the history of ethnomusicological thought, which is recognized now more than ever for the important lessons it has to teach us. • Asiya I. Muhambetova: "The Traditional Musical Culture of Kazakhs in the Social Context of the 20th Century," 66-83. Abstract: The orally transmitted music of Kazakh professional singers and instrumentalists was rooted in pastoral life. Music performance was combined with socially meaningful intercourse, and the sta- tus of the musician as the chosen representative of the spirits and the incarnation of universal prin- ciples was very high. The paper examines the grave transformations which occurred from the 1920s on, above all as a result of the disastrous collectivization, also of urbanization and Westernization in Kazakh society and their influence on traditional culture and discusses the state patronage with its ideological impacts on traditional music making. While the traditional Kazakh singer and instrumen- talist in the rural/pastoral context was facing his increasing marginalization as a professional artist, the new Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments with its "leap" to polyphony became considered the official symbol for progress in a socialist society. From the 1960s on, a new attitude towards the preservation and development of traditional Kazakh culture has led to new performance contexts and vol. 37, 1995 (3)</page><page sequence="125">2.

Abstract : When I was first approached about reviewing some recent recordings of Bulgarian music, I conducted a quick survey of the pertinent literature found in three major ethnomusicology publications {the world of music , Yearbook for Traditional Music , and Ethnomusicology ) between 1988 and 1995. Much to my surprise, not a single review of a Bulgarian music recording emerged, despite the deluge of releases hitting the American marketplace since 1987, when Marcel Cellier 's Le mystère des voix bulgares series began to gain international renown (see discography enclosed). This article aims to par- tially correct this oversight, by interpreting three recently released compact discs within the context of the dizzying variety of Bulgarian music now facing the prospective consumer at the local record store. Although these three CDs focus primarily on village styles characteristic of the early 20th century, rather than on the professional musicianship of the state folk ensembles germane to the socialist era, they represent compilations of Bulgarian instrumental and vocal traditions initially recorded or col- lected largely between 1954 and 1979 and then released concurrently with the mystère craze. • Sean Williams: " Betawi and Sundanese Music of the North Coast of Java: topeng Betawi, tanjidor, ajeng.

Abstract : John Blacking is widely regarded as one of the major voices in ethnomusicology during the 1970s and 1980s. His influential reputation was largely based on his books, "Venda Children's Songs" (1967), "How Musical is Man?" (1973) and "A Commonsense View of All Music" (1987), and many articles published in a wide assortment of academic journals. John liked to theorize, and to "meta- theorize". His writings contain a wealth of stimulating ideas, even if not all these are substantiable (Byron 1994:17-8). He believed that music is so central and crucial to human life that it was high time we started trying to understand its significance in the broadest terms. He loved to challenge accepted dogma and turn other people's ideas on their heads. His importance was in exciting people, in catalyz- ing them, and enabling them to carry out research that he suggested or otherwise sparked off. • John Baily: "Music and the Body," 11-30. Abstract : This paper describes a project conducted with John Blacking in 1973-74 on the inter-rela- tionships between instrument morphology, human movement, and music structure for the 14-stringed Herati dutâr, a new form of long-necked lute in western Afghanistan. The research combined Black- ing's interest in the relationship between a musical instrument and the human body with Baily's train- ing in human movement and sensori-motor co-ordination. The results showed how the structural and operational characteristics of the human sensori-motor system may become embedded in musical structures. • Gerd Baumann: "Music and Dance: The Royal Road to Affective Culture?," 3 1-42 Abstract : In order to go beyond a study of music as reflecting "other" social facts, John Blacking paid sustained attention to the contribution of music and dance to affective culture. By this term he described that dimension inherent in all social action which mobilizes and validates decision-making on non-purposive grounds. Using data collected among the Miri of the Nuba Mountains (Sudan), the article traces the affective aspects of several genres. Thus, the informal "moonlight dances" of village youth are seen as a stylized form of the process of courtship itself, and the rain-making dance which forms the high-point of the Miri ritual year, is understood, "pace" Durkheim, as an occasion of ritual communion. In evaluating John Blacking's approach to music and dance as the chief media of affec- tive culture, it seems appropriate to draw a clear distinction between folk reifications of the "power" of vol. 37, 1995 (2)</page><page sequence="127">2.

Abstract : Throughout Blackings writing, music and dance have been presented as species-specific behaviors which are part of the human biogrammar. He often argued that they were primary modeling systems of communication and that they preceded speech in human history. This paper presents the theories proposed by Blacking on the topic of dance, biological evolution, and cultural development. This theoretical framework is then used to analyze a group of dances among the Tiwi of Northern Australia, which can be labeled "kinship dances" in the sense that they are best understood as a set of non-verbal communications about kinship. It shows how, among the Tiwi, reality was transcended by the performers' ability to move and dance through the three parallel worlds of the Unborn, the Living, and Dead and how the kinship dances played a role in shaping relationships; imagining reality as well as reflecting it. • Ankica Petrovič: "Perception of Ganga" 60-71 . Abstract: In her paper the author discusses the impact that working with Blacking had on the inter- pretation of research she had already undertaken as a Yugoslav ethnomusicologist on the vocal genre ganga. This brought about her conversion from the orthodox ethnomusicology of Eastern Europe to a more revolutionary way of interpreting traditional music. Her further fieldwork, following up some of Blackings suggestions, constitutes a classic example of discovering the articulateness and richness of the folk view. Changes in the symbolic meanings of ganga and some other forms of traditional music in the present civil war are also described. • Suzel Ana Reily: "Political Implications of Musical Performance," 72-102. Abstract : This paper addresses John Blacking's preoccupation with the political implications of mu- sical performance with reference to a popular Catholic polyphonic tradition of southeastern Brazil. For Blacking all musical performance is inherently political, since it involves coordinated interaction among people, providing them with a means of perceiving themselves in relation to others. I discuss the use of different performance practices for the same tradition during three different historical phases. By taking this comparative approach I show that the appropriation of different polyphonic styles is linked to the participants' understandings of the relationships affecting their lives at different moments.

Articles • Uri Sharvit: "Jewish Musical Culture - Fast and Present," 3-17. Abstract. We are now aware that studies of any musical culture, including the Jewish one, must be renewed by considering the various processes of change taking place within those cultures, processes that themselves become integral parts of those cultures. In addition, the researcher must acquire de- tailed knowledge of the deeper meaning underlying the entire acoustic repertory of the group under study. Such knowledge can he reached through a systematic study of the socio-cultural situation of the group. Therefore, the Jewish people must be studied through a diachronic as well as a synchronic investigation of their socio-musical circles. In dealing with Jewish liturgical services, I have found that a certain musical phenomenon amongst the Jewish Yemenite groups, namely singing in parallel fifths and fourths, is not only an aesthetic value that elevates the music but also a socio-cultural tool that contributes to the coherence of the society. Also contributing to cohesiveness is the fact that any liturgical piece can be sung by Jewish cantors in a "simple" version or in an "elevated" one, the latter being considered by the members of the community as a direct contribution to the social success of the whole liturgical event. • Mark Slobin: "Ten Paradoxes and Four Dilemmas of Studying Jewish Music," 1 8-23.

Contents and Abstracts • 147 Abstract This article sets forth and discusses a paradox related to the study of Jewish music: while scholars acknowledge the diverse styles of Jewish musical expression, mythologies of a single, un- changing tradition persist within the Jewish community at large. Following a discussion of the history of this paradox and its dose relationship to the situation in other fields of Jewish studies past and pres- ent, the article explores several important issues related to the study of Jewish music. Examples drawn from scholarship on the Hasidic, the Syrian-Jewish, and the broader Sephardic musical traditions are used to illuminate the close but conflicted relationship between scholarly and popular views of the same subject. The conclusion suggests that while Jewish music derives from the diverse styles of dif- ferent times and places, it at the same time symbolizes a common heritage conceived as anchored in the past, giving rise to the mythologies of continuity that challenge scholarly findings. • Edwin Seroussi: "Reconstructing Sephardi Music in the 20th Century: Isaac Levy and his Chants Judeo-Espagnols 39-58. Abstract : The traditional music of the Sephardi Jews, the descendants of the Spanish Jews who settled in the rims of the Mediterranean after their expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, had under- gone in the 20th century a process of reconstruction, which includes recollection (i.e. recordings of the musical legacy of individual culture-bearers), re-transcription (i.e. production of musical notations from these recordings by members of the recorded culture), re-presentation (i.e. staged performances by professional artists on behalf of general audiences) of traditional music and re-location (perfor- mance outside its original geographical and social context). This reconstruction occurred at the initia- tive of individuals who manipulated traditional Sephardi music and were responsible for the ideologies behind the creation of its new meanings. The focus of this study is Sephardi journalist, singer, and music collector Isaac Levy (1919-1977). Levy's activities included the documentation and publication of Sephardi music in Israel, the commission of arrangements of this music by professional compos- ers which were then interpreted by him or by other artists and the promotion of these arrangements through the media. His work had an incommensurable effect on the shaping of Sephardi music in the second half of the 20th century. This article is devoted to his most influential collection: Chants judeo- espagnols. • Eliyahu Schleifer: "Current Trends of Liturgical Music in the Ashkenazi Synagogue," 59-72. Abstract : The Ashkenazim - the Jews of Western and Eastern Europe whose ancestors settled around the River Rhine during the early Middle Ages - share an old tradition of synagogue chants. Many of them emigrated from Germany to the Eastern European countries, where they united with the local Jews and formed new communities that absorbed the Ashkenazi tradition. Thus two distinct Ashkenazi cultures were developed in Eastern and Western Europe. During the last fifty years, the Ashkenazi sacred music has undergone important changes which were caused by the demographic upheaval that followed the Holocaust, by the establishment of the State of Israel and by modern ideological develop- ments. The destruction of the Jewish communities of Western Europe brought on a major decline of the Western Ashkenazi tradition of synagogue chants and it is now almost extinct. The establishment of the State of Israel influenced the modern synagogues to change their Hebrew pronunciation and to introduce a new "Mediterranean" style in their music. The ordination of women as cantors in the Re- form and Conservative movements has caused some changes in the music as well. The liturgical music of the Ashkenazi synagogues developed to high standards and great virtuosity during the second half of the 19th century and continued so until the 1960s. Since then, however, a major tendency towards popularization has been felt in all of the denominations of the Ashkenazi Jews: Orthodox, Conserva- tive and Reform. Even Hasidic music has been influenced by pop music. This common trend has raised debates among liturgical scholars, cantors, and musicians. While some deplore the deterioration, others see it as a positive trend, making the synagogue more viable for future generations.</page><page sequence="130">148 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Book Reviews (Habib Hassan Tourna, ed.) • Cathy Brigham: "Edward Larkey.

Abstract : In an examination of changing patterns of music and dance behavior in a valley region of east Transylvania, Romania, a number of over-arching social factors are discernible concerning: (1) vari- ability in the extent and effectiveness of external administrative intrusion in local mimetic expression during the communist and post-communist periods; (2) the selective nature of group memory and con- sequent acceptance of "invented tradition" to accommodate changing tastes and preferences; (3) social status and self-image of villagers, and inter- and intra-group relations within villages and between dif- ferent village communities. The essay bears witness to the value of long-term field observation and the uneven though ongoing process of interaction between centers, peripheries, and peripheral centers. • Risto Pekka Pennanen: "All-Comprehending, United, and Divine. The Myth of ilahiya Hymns in Sarajevo," 49-67. Abstract : The article is a study on the myth of Sufi music related by Seid Strik, a respected member of the Nakšibendi order. In the 1980s, after the rebirth of public religious life of Sufi groups he was re- garded as the most important authority of ilahija or Islamic religious hymns in Sarajevo. These hymns are performed in Serbo-Croatian, Turkish or Arabic without any melodic instrumental accompaniment. Drums are used occasionally. Many of these hymns originate from Anatolia. Strik tells about different kinds of ilahije and their functions. He compares ilahije with Bosnian sevdalinka love songs, church music and Western art music and relates a myth the starting point of which is the elementary contradis- tinction of sacred and profane. The structure of the myth is finally analyzed with the "semiotic square" of A.J. Greimas. • Frank J. Korom: "The Transformation of Language to Rhythm: The Hosay Drum of Trinidad," 68-85. Abstract This paper begins with the notion of speech surrogates in the study of music by suggesting the alternate "song surrogate" for forms of non-verbal music that have replaced spoken, chanted or sung communication. The specific example used is the Hosay drums (tassa) of Trinidad. On the island, as East Indian residents began favoring English as their common tongue, the song genre marcee waned in ritual usage. Simultaneously, the mournful narratives of the marcee were "translated" into drum melodies. My contention is that the tassa rhythms used to replace the song genre grew in importance as the genre fell into disuse. • Hiromi Lorraine Sakata: "The Sacred and the Profane: Qawwâlï Represented in the Performances ofNusrat Fateh Ali Khan," 86-99. Abstract : Qawwâlï is the musical expression of Sufi poetry in South Asia, a form of devotion that conveys mystic, religious songs in a manner that is intended to make the listeners more receptive to understanding the message of the songs. This traditional, spiritual genre has undergone a dramatic transformation that now allows its presentation as a secular, concert genre as well as a popular, com- mercial genre both inside and outside of Pakistan. This article explains how such a traditional spiritual genre manages to retain its spiritual identity even in the secular-popular spheres. All the examples in the article are based on performances ofNusrat Fateh Ali Khan of Pakistan.</page><page sequence="132">150 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Book Reviews • Raúl R.

In the wake of Africa's transition to independence and nationalism following World War II came a musical shift from acoustic to electric guitars plus a surge in the recording industry. Musicians met these challenges, redefining their identity, and creating a synthesis of older genres and new ideas. A vol. 36, 1994 (2)</page><page sequence="133">2. Contents and Abstracts • 151 retrospective of guitar research indicates that the acoustic guitar was more wide-spread at an earlier time in West Africa than occurred in East and Central Africa. The acoustic two-finger picking "palm wine" style and its vocabulary of rhythmic-melodic formulae were diffused primarily by Kru mariners and other migrant laborers of West Africa early in this century. Electric guitar bands, which emerged in the late 1940s, some rooted in local acoustic guitar bands, have played a prominent role. With over 60 years of recordings now available, guitar music offers rich comparative material for study. • Eric Charry: "The Grand Mande Guitar Tradition of the Western Sahel and Savannah," 21-61. Abstract Mande guitarists are active players in an unbroken and still-vibrant tradition that goes back to the 13th-century founding of the Mande, or Mali, empire. That tradition is primarily guarded by jelis, hereditary professional verbal/musical artisans. The acoustic guitar was first picked up in the 1 920s or 1 930s by jelis who began an Africanization process by adapting their balafon (xylophone), nkoni (lute), and kora (harp) repertories and playing styles to it. The rise of modern Mande music and of the electric guitar began with the independence of Guinea in 1958 when the new government launched a sweep- ing modernization policy in which European musical instruments (including electric guitars) were handed out, musicians were made civil servants, and a network of regional and national orchestras was established. Mali soon followed suit. Jelis used the electric guitar as the main vehicle for transferring their local repertories to these new urban electric groups. The process of traditional musicians {jelis) embracing, Africanizing, and integrating the guitar into their music culture, and then using it to move their music into the international arena of popular dance music is the focus of this article. • Kazadi wa Mukuna: "The Changing Role of the Guitar in the Urban Music of Zaire," 62-72.

During the embryonic stage of this urban musical expression, the acoustic guitar s primary role was to provide accompaniment to troubadour-like singers with the chord progression (tonic-subdominant-dominant [dominant seventh]-tonic). With the improvement of its ability to produce percussive sounds, the role of the guitar was expanded to include participation in the rhythmic tapestry of the music by which eth- nically derived dances are accompanied. • Ernest D. Brown: "The Guitar and the Mbira: Resilience, Assimilation, and Pan- Africanism in Zimbabwean Music," 73-117. Abstract In the 20th century, the guitar and mbira have been the most important musical instruments in Zimbabwe, and they symbolize a dichotomy of values, culture, and consciousness - urban-rural, European- African, and modern-traditional. This dichotomy has become an important part of the social experience of Africans in Zimbabwe, and its resolution is a recurrent theme in Zimbabwean music his- tory. At certain times, the resolution of this dichotomy has been expressed musically by a preference for one instrument over the other, while at other times elements of mbira or guitar music have been blended with each other, creating a continuum of musical choices between the extremes. In addition, the resolution of this dichotomy in particular periods has been strongly influenced by the interaction of three cultural tendencies - resilience, assimilation, and pan-Africanism. For example, because of pres- sures to assimilate, Africans began to abandon the mbira for acoustic guitars in the 1940s, although the guitar style that developed showed the resilience of traditional African music because it was influenced by mbira music. In the 1950s, under the pan-Africanist influences, guitar styles from Zaire, South Africa, and Afro-America began to replace the mò/ra-influenced guitar styles which were too rural to express the aspirations of an African population undergoing rapid urbanization. Mbira music went into a severe decline. The new guitar styles, which were at first acoustic and later electric, were undeniably urban, modern, and associated with rising social aspirations, but they were derived from other African or African-American cultures. As such these styles offered Africans an urban, modern alternative to assimilated European music and to m6/ra-influenced music. These complex cultural interactions con- tinue to shape the development of guitar and mbira music today.</page><page sequence="134">152 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Nollene Davies: "The Guitar in Zulu Maskanda Tradition," 1 1 8-37. Abstract : Maskanda is a genre of music played predominantly by Zulu males. Acoustic instruments such as the guitar, concertina and violin are commonly used to perform this music which is played largely for self-enjoyment. In a group situation electric guitars, drums, acoustic instruments and oc- casionally a keyboard are used and dancers who add backing vocals are also included. The introduc- tion of electric instruments into maskanda music and thus the formation of maskanda groups occurred relatively late in comparison to other popular genres of music in South Africa. Solo performance on an acoustic instrument, primarily the guitar, is still the preferred medium for maskanda musicians today. However, those musicians who aspire to making recordings are forced to form a group since the record- ing industry does not record solo maskanda artists. Many changes have taken place in the maskanda tradition as it has developed over the years in response to a changing social environment. A factor which remains constant throughout this development is that the music continues to reflect the influence of older Zulu musics, which tends to set it apart from other popular South African instrumental styles. • Cynthia Schmidt: "An Interview with John Collins on Cultural Policy, Folklore and the Recording Industry in Ghana," 138-47. Abstract : In this interview of April, 1 994, John Collins discusses recent developments in Ghanaian cul- tural policy with Cynthia Schmidt. Collins, who resides in Ghana, is an ethnomusicologist, a musician, and a prolific author of several books on popular music including "West African Pop Roots." He started the first independent recording studio in Ghana called Bokoor Studios. In 1993 he was appointed as a member of the newly formed Ghana Copyright Commission. One of that Commission's recent deci- sions was to declare that the Ghanaian song "Yaa Amponsah" is now public domain. "Yaa Amponsah" was one of the first commercial recordings of West African guitar music (1928) and can be heard on the recent CD by Paul Simon called Rhythm of the Saints (1990).

Abstract : According to a catalogue published by Zonophone in 1929, by that year the British gramo- phone Company had produced over 420 records in the category of "West African Records by Native Artists." These recordings featured over 40 named recording artists performing vocal and instrumental music in twenty languages, including Yoruba, Hausa, Kru, English, and Latin. The re-mastering and re-edition of these onto compact disks by the Heritage label of England allows the general listener to hear several dozen tracks of Zonophone recordings by West African musicians.

Articles • Catherine J. Ellis: "Introduction. Powerful Songs: Their Placement in Aboriginal Thought," 3-20. Abstract The experiences embodied in the papers in this volume highlight the need to re-evaluate the discipline of ethnomusicology, and perhaps to redefine our guiding principles. There is a growing awareness among a number of Australian researchers of the levels of knowledge and insight that the original inhabitants of this land possess about living in its physical and spiritual environment. Ethno- musicologists involved in Australian studies may hold a unique position in their discipline because they work in traditions in which music is the central fixed medium through which the culture is main- tained. Research into Aboriginal music leads the scholar into the deep and mystical realms of the sacred and often secret rituals of an ancient, yet living tradition. The more the researcher is exposed to these profound spheres of Aboriginal thought, epitomized in the Dreaming and controlled by the gerontocra- cy, the more complicated are the ethical problems that must be resolved. The appropriate maintenance of the power latent in these songs is a central concern of performers and researchers alike. All the pa- pers in this volume deal in some way with the great difficulties inherent in this living or, alternatively, archival preservation in the modern world, or indeed with whether it should occur at all. • Arthur Lampton and Guy Tunstill: "Aboriginal Music Students' Views on Aboriginal Music Research," 21^0. Abstract All students at CASM, in Adelaide, are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people and repre- sent a wide variety of regions in Aboriginal Australia. Virtually all, however, are at some remove from their traditional background and the three-year course at CASM represents their first direct contact with traditional Aboriginal music on an extended teacher-student basis. Despite this gap most students are aware of the dilemma traditional music faces. They believe that research on traditional music should be controlled by, and be designed to benefit, the community to which the music belongs; yet it is rec- ognized that communities wishing to establish supportive research will, for the immediate future, be dependent on outsiders with technology. There was a distinction made between Aboriginal outsiders (with respect to the target community) and non-Aboriginal outsiders, concerning their respective re- search roles. Out of the diversity of views recorded, the clearest common ground is found in the idea that research can potentially be an affirming activity for cultural traditions under stress, and that a greater understanding of musical differences across cultural divisions is an effective way of improving race relations.

Abstracts : The following three papers look beneath the surface interactions of groups of musicians in the Northern Territory and in the extensively white-settled areas of northern New South Wales to the political forces that control those interactions and to the resultant responsibilities placed on the researcher. The fact that science itself is one of those forces is explored in Udo Will's paper.

She also observes how recordings and research are being used by Bundjalung today. Ste- phen Wild concentrates his paper on changes that occurred with empowerment of Aboriginal people in Australia during the period 1972-1975 under a left-wing Australian government after more than two decades of conservative government. This political process has affected relationships between researchers and Aboriginal people, and although the impact of this may lead to impoverishment of our understanding and our documentation of whole repertoires, it is an acceptable part of the cost of re-empowering Aboriginal people to control their own lives. Udo Will covers a similar theme from the perspective of a non-Australian researcher who has not carried out fieldwork in Australia (although he has in several other cultures). He argues that science as we know it does not operate within a value-free space, and its findings may have little relevance to Aboriginal thought. The tenets of science, and its presumed search for "truth" enables it to remain without any effective control from society. The dan- gerous aspects of science stem not from methodology, but from attempts to find, reconstruct or even invent a scientific basis for certain political and ideological ideas in order to legitimize them. • Margaret Gummow: "The Power of the Past in the Present: Singers and Songs from Northern New South Wales, 42-50. Abstract This paper discusses some of the issues and purposes behind my research in the Bundjalung area in northern New South Wales (NSW) and southern Queensland. From 1985 to 1989 I visited Bundjalung people almost every year. In many ways research in this area is different from other areas of Australia due to the long history of European contact. Any musicological study in south-eastern Australia must take into consideration the problems Aboriginal people are facing when trying to make details of their past relevant today. This is one of the major underlying issues I encountered during the early stages of my research. In the Bundjalung area and generally throughout south-eastern Australia it is apparent that today "the memories of old people, anthropological writings, archaeological remains, documentary records, are all ransacked to give authenticity to competing constructions" of Aboriginal- ly (Beckett 1988). • Stephen Wild: "Reflections on Field Research in Aboriginal Australia: Central Australia and Arnhem Land," 51-58. Abstract : Ethnomusicologists who have worked among Australian Aborigines both before and after about 1975 are especially aware of a shift in Aboriginal attitudes toward researchers. The nationality of the researcher matters not in this context, although researchers who have recently come from abroad to work in Australia are often surprised, if not shocked, by the constraints imposed on their research. Prior to about 1975 (the precise year varies from region to region) Aboriginal people seemed little concerned about what researchers did with recordings, field notes, photographs and the like, and after about 1975 researchers have been increasingly questioned about the proposed uses of the research materials and about what guarantees the Aboriginal people have against improper uses. • Udo Will: "Tradition versus Science!? Reflections on Interactions and Responsibilities," 59-81. Abstract In present day Australia the controls on Aboriginal research have been largely implemented through governmental laws and regulations: anyone who intends to do research on Aboriginal subjects has to seek permission from the respective Aboriginal Land Council and the community concerned before taking up the project as well as before publication and distribution of the research results. How- ever, as well intended as the implementation might be, the actual practice is not without difficulties and problems. At the core of these problems is the fact that Aborigines have been given means of control not in terms of their own culture but in terms of the Western legal System (i. e. administrative regula- tions and laws). In the present context this means that those Aborigines who are the most familiar with the Western system (through their education, language capabilities, etc.) will exert the control, and they are, most likely, not those best versed in their own culture: not the owners of the tradition but the "mediators" of the Western culture become guardians of the tradition.</page><page sequence="137">2. Contents and Abstracts • 155 Changes of Perspective as a Result of Conceptual Interaction between Singers and Researchers , 66-103. Abstracts : These papers show different degrees of change of perception of researchers about research in the course of interactive contact with performers, and to some extent they also demonstrate changes in perceptions of the performers. The first two papers are experiences of interactions from northern Australia, where culture contact occurred well before the coming of white people. The third comes from northern South Australia, an area protected from outside intrusion for many years after the Eng- lish first "discovered" Australia, thanks to the remoteness of the area, and the severity of the desert environment which continues to be inhospitable. • Allan Marett: " Wangga : Socially Powerful Songs?" 67-81. Abstract The ontological status of song-giving spirits in northern Australia is inextricably linked to the position that wangga hold in an Aboriginal Universe, and allows them to be performed with no reli- gious restrictions concerning who may witness the performance. Wangga , because they function to join people together and establish commonalities of experience, can become powerful vehicles for recon- ciliation and healing of interactions between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. He discusses how wangga have helped him in his own struggle to come to terms with the devastations brought by European imperialism on the Aboriginal people with whom he has worked. • Jill Stubington: "Yolngu manikay at Yirrkala: The Construction of a Research Field," 82-92. Abstract. The paper details the ways in which research at Yirrkala, northern Australia, has developed and the new ways in which Yolngu at Yirrkala are asserting their interest in it and publishing about it. Some local Yolngu initiatives are examined. These suggest that future Balanda ("non-Aboriginal") research into Yolngu music will have to acknowledge and make more explicit the reflexivity of the eth- nographic process and accommodate Yolngu interest in the design, process, and results. • Bill Mungie, Guy Tunstill and Catherine J. Ellis: "Coming Together as One," 93-103. Abstract Mungie, Tunstill and Ellis spent time together in Central Australia discussing the role of researchers as understood by the traditional knowledgeable song-owners (of whom Mungie is one). These singers request that work continue on teaching non-Aboriginal people about the importance of songs of the tjukurpa ("Dreaming", "Law"), and about the deep knowledge of the singers. The old people stressed that outside researchers must not allow younger Aboriginal people, who are not learn- ing their songs now, to disrupt the close interaction between singers and researchers that has existed in the past, but researchers themselves must always keep the singers informed of their work and observe the new regulations of the modern administrative structures.

Abstract Theoretical studies of processes of musical change have been aimed at subsuming under a covering model the bewildering array of variables involved in any cultural contact. Adelaida Reyes- Schramm ( 1 986, 1 989, and 1 990) has restated the need to consider the specificity of processes, as in the extreme case of the study of the role music plays in the resettlement of communities of forced migrants. So far such studies have dealt with the web of interactions of the whole displaced ethnic group with the receiving society. The paper concentrates on broad implications of the involuntary displacement of a professional musician. The paper will attempt to coalesce the models of change mentioned above with two groups of studies in the fields of sociology and social psychology - sociological models of migrant and refugee movements, and studies of the phenomenon of ethnic identity according to George de Vos and George Devereux. • Richard Widdess: "The Geography of raga in Ancient India," 35-50. Abstract : Classical musicians in South Asia often ascribe the origins of their music to the highest and oldest tradition of ritual music, the Sãmaveda, the "Veda of Chants." Musicologists, on the other hand, have sometimes assumed that classical Indian music and its rãgas derive at least in part from "folk" music and even from the music of the so-called "tribal" or "aboriginal" groups (ãdivãsí) that survive in isolated areas of the sub-continent. One of the most distinguished of modern Indian musicologists, the late B.C. Deva (1974), also believed that the classical tradition resulted from a fusion of many musical strands, reflecting the geographical extent, the social diversity, and the historical depth of South Asian culture. He suggested that temple and other religious music traditions constitute one among many channels between classical and non-classical musics, and recognized that musical styles, structures and instruments have flowed in both directions through such channels. To what extent such roots lie in the music of the Veda or of the Vedda remains a matter for conjecture. vol. 35, 1993 (3)</page><page sequence="139">2.

Abstract : Ethnomusicological studies of cultural groups have long shown the importance of music as an emblem that maintains and reinforces group solidarity. Issues related to the assertion of "cultural identity" and the uses of music in negotiating relationships within multi-cultural contexts have assumed a prominent role in examinations of contemporary musical life. This essay deals with the role of music in the religious and social lives of the Shakers of Sabbathday Lake, Maine, an American sect, as a pow- erful instrument of spiritual expression and social integration. This role has changed significantly in recent decades as the Shakers have been threatened with extinction. As the remnants of an 1 8th-century experiment in Utopian living, contemporary Shakers have had to fight for their continued existence. In this process - one undergone by innumerable cultural minorities around the world today - music serves simultaneously as a means of promoting a sense of belonging to the group, as distinguished from the outside world, and as a tool to promote mutual understanding with that same world. • Vesa Kurkela: "Deregulation of Popular Music in the European Post-Communist Countries: Business, Identity, and Cultural Collage," 80-106. Abstract : Today all the post-communist countries in Europe are facing a rapid deregulation process of musical life. The public broadcasting and record companies owned by the state have lost their mo- nopoly, and several commercial radio stations and record companies have mushroomed in the eastern metropolises. Furthermore, the musical life connected to concerts, festivals, and various institutions around them has also been deregulated. Earlier the state controlled everything in music production, but it also paid for almost everything. Today there is greater freedom to organize concerts and festivals, but, accordingly, the sponsors must be found on the free market. Due to the bad economic situation, public support for cultural activities is much smaller than earlier and is probably decreasing all the time. The new situation raises several questions pertinent to the present theoretical discussion in eth- nomusicology, media studies, and cultural studies in general. The main subject here is to analyze how the deregulation process changes music production at different local levels, from community feasts to phonogram business, and broadcasting.

Abstract : The fact that ethnomusicologists are now increasingly devoting their attention to a phe- nomenon rather inadequately labeled "world beat" or "world music" indicates perhaps not so much a shift of study object, but the rising concern over the discipline's own theoretical and methodological premises. The emergence of world beat in the early 1980s coincides with a growing uneasiness in the social sciences and humanities about our institutional practice and the conventional modes and politics of representation in anthropology, ethnomusicology, folklore, comparative literature, and other fields. In earlier phases of "culture contact," as the phrase went, ethnomusicologists as a rule were unanimous in rejecting musical change induced by Western domination as a mere anomaly that, apart from being aesthetically unpalatable, did not require a rethinking of the discipline's implicit a prioris. By contrast, most ethnomusicologists now seem to be prepared not only to admit that colonization, conquest, and exploitation are "immoral acts" that can be "shown to result in interesting music, but many also engage in some sort of critical self-reflection on some of our most taken-for-granted theoretical assumptions and analytical procedures. • Reebee Garofalo: "Whose World, What Beat: The Transnational Music Industry, Identity, and Cultural Imperialism," 16-32. Abstract While there may be cause for cautious optimism in this celebration of difference, it is impor- tant not to get swept away in the notion that multiculturalism per se suggests significantly more than the most bourgeois democratization of power. It must be understood that, in the reconfigurations of the global political and cultural economy, international capital itself is now multicultural. As capital becomes more accustomed to accommodating a broader range of cultural forms, as it surely must, the new diversity of global culture must not be allowed to paper over hierarchizations of race and ethnicity, let alone the age-old inequities associated with gender and class. • Jocelyne Guilbault: "On Redefining the 'Local' Through World Music," 33^7. Abstract Since the early 1980s, much literature in the social sciences has sought to explain the pro- cesses involved in the restructuring and transformation of the political and economic world order. Within this framework, many critics have emphasized the globalization of culture and, correspond- ingly, the cultural industries and new technologies involved in the process of change. What interests me, as an ethnomusicologist who has been involved mainly with the study of local communities, is how the status of the "local" has been transformed within contemporary societies, but also why and for whom it has become vitally important to redefine it today. In this paper, 1 will use the phenomenon of "world music" as a case in point to assess the primacy of this question in the ongoing politics of popular musical culture. • Deborah Pacini Hernandez: "A View from the South: Spanish Caribbean Perspectives on World Beat," 48-69.

One of the most prominent musical indicators of these new conditions is the phenomenon known as "world beat" in the United States, and "world music" in Europe, which is both a reflection and an agent of processes of musi- cal and cultural interaction between widely disparate regions of the world. World beat is not a musi- cal genre, but rather a marketing term describing the products of musical cross-fertilization between north - the U.S. and Western Europe, and south - primarily Africa and the Caribbean Basin, which began appearing on the popular music land-scape in the early 1980s. • Paul Austerlitz: "Local and International Trends in Dominican Merengue ," 70-89. Abstract : Some portend the "grey-out" of local expressive culture, as internationally-diffused popular culture emanating from industrialized countries growingly dominates throughout the world. Others argue that local expressive forms are flourishing. James Clifford proposes that both views are valid and that the whole story of contemporary culture can only be told by considering both trends. In fact, the interaction of cultural emergence and homogenization, of local and international trends, is central to the trajectory of many contemporary popular expressive forms. This paper considers the interaction of these two metanarratives in the history of the Dominican popular music, merengue. • Larry N. Crook: "Black Consciousness, Samba Reggae , and the Re-Africanization of Bahian Carnival Music in Brazil," 90-108. Abstract : On May 13, 1988, Brazil commemorated the centenary of the abolition of slavery with of- ficial celebrations held throughout the country. However, not all Brazilians were in a celebratory mood as organizations involved in Brazil's new black consciousness movement opted to counter the official celebrations with demonstrations and marches to expose the "farce of abolition" in light of the racial inequalities and discriminations which Brazil's non-white population continued to face. In Salvador da Bahia, center of Afro-Brazilian culture, the city's black carnival groups spearheaded the demonstra- tions and counter-marches which led the local government to cancel its official abolition celebrations. As cultural counterpoint to the more militant black political organizations such as the "Movimento Negro Unificado" (Unified Black Movement, MNU), black carnival groups - blocos afro - had be- come a dominant force in Salvador's cultural and political life during the 1980s. By 1988, they were well aware of their collective political importance and were, arguably, the most dynamic and socially dedicated cultural organizations in Brazil's black consciousness movement. • Janet Topp Fargion: "The Role of Women in Taarab in Zanzibar: an Historical Examination of a Process of 'Africanization," 109-25. Abstract : Taarab is a style of music played for entertainment at weddings and other festive occasions all along the Swahili coast (a vast area running along the east coast of Africa from northern Mozam- bique to southern Somalia, including the adjacent Islands of Pemba, Zanzibar, Mafia and the archipela- gos of Lamu and Comoro). Taarab contains all the features of a typical "Indian Ocean" music, com- bining influences from Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, India and the West with local musical practices. This music plays such an important part in the lives of all Zanzibaris that it has come to form part of the characterization of the island itself. Along with Zanzibar being described as "the island of cloves," it has also been described as "the island of taarab. "In this paper I intend to use this musical tradition of taarab as a case study to highlight two points: (a) that although taarab music was a direct importation of Egyptian music by the Arab upper-class, it has become "Africanized;" and (b) that this "Africaniza- tion" has been largely brought about as result of the position of women in society and their activities within the cultural realm of taarab.

Abstract: The four contributions contained in this volume deal with the dichotomy between the meth- odological concepts of "emics" and "etics" from various perspectives. While the former refers to a typological differentiation which attempts to analyze and understand above all the configurations of meaning from a culturally inherent perspective, the latter emphasizes the predominantly cross-cultural aspect of external analysis. The discussion taken up anew in anthropology by Kenneth L. Pike, Marvin Harris and Thomas N. Headland in their book Emics and Etics : The Insider/Outsider Debate (1990) has been carried over into the field of ethnomusicology The first article by Frank Alvarez-Pereyre and Simha Arom summarizes the polar positions of Pike and Harris and discusses in particular the quest for emics in the framework of criteria of "minimal units" and the relevant factors in a culture that determine its "strictly musical continuum:" What is musically relevant for a given community? This question is answered with a preference for Pike's categories of emics and etics because the authors feel that the theoretical continuum is enriched through the dialectical relationship between formal analysis and cultural judgment. Using the paradigm of "listening," Max Peter Baumann investigates the emic- etic process in terms of its complementary linking. Transcultural "false listening," corrective listening, as well as the "emic" subjectivity of "inward listening," demonstrate the dialogic interdependence of</page><page sequence="143">2.

In the third contribution, Marcia Herndon examines her own identity "as an approximately half-breed Eastern Cherokee Indian" and comes to the conclusion that, from the scholarly as well as personal viewpoint, no one can be a total insider or a total outsider. In rethinking the usage of emics and etics, it would therefore be better to be ready to develop farther-reaching multi-dimensional models. The final article by Gerald Florian Messner is devoted as well to meta-reflection about the perspective of the investiga- tor. According to him, the insider-outsider debate still reflects a thoroughly Western way of thinking. Messner advocates an integrative concept of insider and outsider of two categories that complement each other. This "creative circle" applies likewise to all these articles, a circle which, in the words of Francisco Varela, circumscribes a fractal wherever one begins and which always reflects only a part of that which one does: this is to describe. • Frank Alvarez-Pereyre and Simha Arom: "Ethnomusicology and the Emic/Etic Issue," 7-33. Abstract Gerald F. Murray (1990) considers the term "emics" as applying in either of two situations: "The informants provide the categories and/or say they agree with our analysis." We believe a clear distinction should be made between this kind of judgment and reference to cultural data surrounding the music. This is not because there is a fundamental difference between the former and latter, but also (and primarily) because we feel the distinction between such categories enriches Pike's theoretical con- tinuum. In the light of this distinction, we would say that, while the "judgment of acceptability" Murray wants to obtain from the members of a culture is a part of emics (insofar as the student of the culture calls it forth), internal cultural data open onto an entirely new dimension which, whether we like it or not, exists independently of any research activity, i. e., the "cognitive universe" of group under study. • Max Peter Baumann: "Listening as an Emic/Etic Process in the Context of Observation and Inquiry," 34-62. Abstract : The terms "emic" and "etic" mutually determine each other through their complementary system of reference. The differentiated use of the terms in literature indicates that a simple consensus over their application is scarcely possible. The operable emic-etic definition according to James Lett (1990) illuminates the complementary character of the conceptual make-up. The emic construction aims to research the "folk system," that is the conceptual systematization of data, facts, and events de- veloped by the ethnic group itself as the "insider view," while the etic construction takes as its goal the development of an "outsider view" as a conceptual tool for analytical purposes which in intercultural comparisons can provide information concerning the status of potential "universais" in the theory of culture. Bruno Netti (1983) has summarized the difference between emic and etic as "two sides of a coin," and suggests that emic and etic viewpoints might better be labeled "the people's and the anthro- pologist's analyses. • Marcia Herndon: "Insiders, Outsiders: Knowing our Limits, Limiting our Knowing," 63-80. Abstract : I speak as myself; neither insider nor outsider, neither fully emic nor fully etic. As I began my Eastern Cherokee field work, 1 was at home in the area, knew of my mixed-blood status with Cherokee coming from both sides of my family, had a smattering of Cherokee words and phrases, and had some degree of enculturation into Cherokee life from childhood. I was not a total insider, either genetically or culturally. Although I had access, and that access was deepened by others' past experience with my relatives, I never became, nor could I ever become, a total insider. As a college-trained scholar, steeped in the ways of interpretation of behavior created by Europeans and Euro-Americans - I certainly could not hope to acquire enough knowledge or Cherokee ways of thinking to be able to overcome my formal education, nor did I really want to do so. • Gerald Florian Messner: Ethnomusicological Research, Another 'Performance' in the International Year of Indigenous Peoples?" 81-95.

This is of course simply not so. The process of scientific investigation is also a performance, governed by cultural rules as is any other. In the case of ethnomusicology and anthropol- ogy this performance is undertaken in order to investigate an alien performance, one which is powered by different cult/ural processes. The performance of investigation and research is structured and con- trolled by cult/ural attitudes and viewpoints which synchronize perfectly with the operational closure of the cult/ural system within which they unfold, and which at the same time provides the motivation for their existence. These two performances that of the investigation and that which is its subject, take place within different continua of thought. Book Reviews • Josef Kuckertz: "Lewis Powell.

Contents and Abstracts *163 Abstract : The psychology of music, focusing on such issues as music perception, and the cognitive development and representation of musical knowledge, primarily sought universais in human behavior with respect to music and music learning. Ethnomusicology, related more closely to the humanistic disciplines of musicology and anthropology, asked many of the same questions, but (at least since the 1 960s) seemed to focus more on the diversity of human musical experience and the role of specific, often highly complex, social and cultural contexts. Furthermore, the methods of psychologists, who collected data through controlled experiments, and used predominantly American subjects, seemed at odds with those of ethnomusicologists in the (non-American) field, who elicited information in "real- life" situations, as they co-existed and often collaborated with informants. Recent developments in the field of cognitive psychology and ethnomusicology, however, have begun to address these differences and there are signs of change. The papers presented here, each in its own way, thus seek to answer the following questions: How have the two fields changed in recent years, so that they no longer seem at odds with one another, and, what precisely do they share now? • Elizabeth Tolbert: "Theories of Meaning and Music Cognition: An Ethnomusicological Approach," 7-2 1 . Abstract. This paper discusses theories of meaning and their relationship to music cognition from an ethnomusicological point of view. In contrast to the other contributors to this issue, 1 do not present an empirical case study; rather, 1 address theoretical problems that are informed by both empirical and theoretical studies in a variety of disciplines. I hope to suggest avenues for further research by address- ing the following questions: What are some of the cognitive processes theorized to be involved in the formation of meaning, and could these be applied to musical meaning? How can a theory of meaning, and by extension, musical meaning, incorporate data from ethnomusicology on the one hand, and neu- robiology and psychology, on the other, from the lowest levels to the highest levels of cognition? To answer these questions, I integrate and juxtapose recent work in music cognition, philosophy, linguis- tics, and anthropology to create a new perspective on the problem of musical meaning. • Jeanne Bamberger and Evan Ziporyn: "Getting It Wrong," 22-56. Abstract'. Certainly there is a need for a common vocabulary: if we wish to talk about music to one another, we need to define our terms. But in the service of clarity and fending off what we fear might be our students' confusions, we try to iron out existing inconsistencies. Mounting rules, we treat them not only as descriptions but as explanations and accountings: normative musical behavior and its ex- ceptions that we call "the curriculum." Going backwards, we use our analytic stories to re-invent lived experience in the image of our learned assumptions and notations - those distillations from the past we have almost come to believe in. But the analytic stories we tell rarely succeed because it is in the nature of language and of notations to break-up and to reify. Still, recognizing that what we can say is always partial, a selection, and that these selections differ from those we select in action (be it performing or listening), we continue to learn through our efforts to match our analyses with what remains unsaid in musical experience - the seemingly seamless meld, all-at-once, successions of moments that create meanings we make as they disappear in time. • John Baily and Peter Driver: "Spatio-Motor Thinking in Playing Folk Blues Guitar," 57-71. Abstract : In this paper we make a start in looking at a variety of guitar styles in order to see how this instrument type is utilized in a number of different musics. While further evidence is required to flesh out our claims about the importance of the spatio-motor mode of thinking in folk blues guitar playing, it seems from our point of view that this manner of playing the guitar uses a strong spatial representa- tion, where the characteristics of the style are strongly conditioned by the parameter of action. It re- inforces the point that studies of musical cognition need to take human movement, and the control of movement, into account. Spatio-motor thinking is intrinsic to all kinds of music. • James Kippen: "Tabla Drumming and the Human-Computer Interaction," 72-98. Abstract : Perhaps the human subject and the musical object cannot (or should not) be separated either notionally or practically. Otto Laske (1991) has also remarked on the "Cartesian split" between music</page><page sequence="146">164 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) as "text" and music as "knowledge" and/or "action," and has argued for "a closer collaboration of the two sides of the methodological (and ideological) divide." In our view, the key to understanding human musical cognition seems to lie with a more pragmatic study of performance as realized by individuals. Ultimately, we may be looking for those cognitive areas where musical, linguistic, and motor gram- mars intersect for clues as to the nature of human musical thought. • Kathryn Vaughn: "Experimental Ethnomusicology: A Perceptual Basis for Jairazbhoy's Circle of That," 99-119. Abstract The work presented here is part of ongoing research concerned with the perceived interaction of the unique timbre of the tambura, a long-necked Indian lute used as a drone instrument, with me- lodic fragments used in North Indian rag performance. One goal of this study is to understand the role of the tambura drone, and the interaction of the drone with melody as part of a figure-ground problem in musical pattern recognition. This involves both the acoustical and perceptual realms. An investiga- tion of the responses of trained listeners to the interaction of the sound of the tambura with 1 0 of the important scale types (thãts) used in the performance of rag serves as a basis from which to explore questions of music perception in actual musical contexts. • Lyle Davidson and Bruce Torff: "Situated Cognition in Music," 120-39. Abstract : A cognitive science based on context and culture questions the isolation of cognitive psychol- ogy from ethnomusicological work. The emerging view of cognition as situated action makes cognitive work an integral part of ethnomusicology. This view enables ethnomusicologists to move toward an integrated view of musical practice which looks at the three critical levels of musical forces: the culture that organizes and gives meaning to cognition; the localized contexts of support for activity which as- sist and guide individual functioning; and cognition as it is seen in the individual.

Articles • Richard Keeling: "The Sources of Indian Music: an Introduction and Overview," 3-21. Abstract : The Plains-derived singing of the modern powwow has emerged as a musical lingua franca among urban Indians and others all over North America, in some cases competing with (and possibly threatening the existence of) older local styles. Other, more abrupt transformations have occurred as well, so that today's Indian music includes styles which are influenced by gospel, by country and western music, and even by rock and roll. The purist may question whether these new forms should be regarded as "spiritual" or even "traditional," but even from this brief history it is clear that Indian mu- sic and culture have been changing and adapting to new circumstances for literally thousands of years, and that we can hardly disqualify these new Indian musics on that score. Clearly, we should be even more careful about imposing preconceived ideas of the sacred, or too narrowly defining the power or spiritual support that modern Indian people derive from their music. • Linda J. Goodman: "Aspects of Spiritual and Political Power in Chiefs Songs of the Makah Indians," 23^42. Abstract : The pattern of song usage and ownership which exists in a number of Northwest Coast tribes is quite different than those which exist for tribes in most of the rest of North America. Among the Makah Indians of Washington State, songs reinforce the placement of individuals and families in the hierarchical structure of the society. Though social position is basically established at birth, songs provide a mnemonic device for connecting the song owner with his/her particular spirit power which, ideally, validates rights to use and ownership of particular songs. • Thomas F. Johnston: "The Socio-Mythic Contexts of Music in Tlingit Shamanism and Potlatch Ceremonials," 43-71 . Abstract This is a study of pre-contact Tlingit Indian shamanism and shamanistic use of music and dance, together with a consideration of shamanistic trait survival in contemporary Tlingit potlatch ceremonials. The fieldwork was carried out in Hoonah, Angoon, Sitka, Haines and Yakutat during 1975-80. In Tlingit mythology, the heroics of clan ancestors led to lasting covenants with the the spirit world. This in turn led to taboos, the breaking of taboos, and evolving beliefs concerning the spiritual penalties for taboo violation. An initiated Tlingit on a spiritual quest through time and space may have met spirit helpers and other forms of life only half human, enduring dangerous close encounters and perhaps perishing because of broken covenants. • Nicole Beaudry: "The Language of Dreams: Songs of the Dene Indians (Canada)," 72- 90.

We will then consider the contemporary drum dance songs and prayer songs, directly related to a "prophet" movement typical of this area. A look at the northern Slavey prophet movement offers some clues as to the transformation of a drum-less dance tradition into the actual drum dance. To this end, we will follow the progres- sion, from traditional to contemporary contexts, of the acquisition and use of spiritual power, of the social recognition of power that calls for marks of respect, of thankfulness, and of obedience to rules voL 34, 1992 (2)</page><page sequence="148">166 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) and obligations on the part of every group member.

Abstract: The purpose of this essay is to look at aspects of Western musical culture in ways that are perhaps not customary to its own society, and incidentally to provide, by implication, a critique of typical ethnomusicological approach and method. Ethnomusicology has traditionally concentrated on non-Western musics and cultures, and to a degree on segments of Western society which do not iden- tify with the so-called classical or "art" music of the concert hall.

Hughes: "' Esashi Oiwake ' and the Beginnings of Modern Japanese Folk Song," 35-56. Abstract: In tracing the birth of the modern "folksong world" in Japan, it soon becomes apparent that one particular song, " Esashi Oiwake, " played a leading role. In this paper we shall examine its history and characteristics in some detail and discuss its influence on subsequent folk song transmission, per- formance practice, and values. The question of influences aside, " Esashi Oiwake" exemplifies so many of the 20th-century trends in this sphere that it is the ideal subject for a case study of the modernization of Japanese folk song. • Gerhard Kubik: "Embairé Xylophone Music of Samusiri Babalanda (Uganda 1968)," 57-84. Abstract: Through my study and practice of amadinda and akadinda with Evaristo Muyinda and my contact with royal musicians at the lubiri (king's enclosure), I was persuaded to assume that southern Uganda - or at least Buganda - was an area where rigid composition techniques and some form of standardization dominated the scene, providing a relatively narrow margin for stylistic and organiza- tional variation from group to group. While this was perhaps true to a certain extent among disciples of Mr. Muyinda, I gradually discovered the relatively wide margin of stylistic variation among performers from the eastern bank of the Nile River: Busoga. • Ruth Davis: "The Effects of Notation on Performance Practice in Tunisian Art Music," 85-114. Abstract: This paper describes how the Tunisian art music repertory, the ma'lüf, was converted from an oral into a written tradition during the 20th century, using Western staff notation. The notation was introduced, not merely in order to document the repertory, but rather to provide the basis for a new type of performance practice inspired by Western aesthetic ideals. The organization responsible for these innovations was the RashTdiyya Institute, founded in Tunis in 1934 as the nation's official guardian of the ma 'lüf. Over the following decade and a half, the RashTdiyya ensemble was responsible for tran- scribing almost the entire repertory of the ma '/«/known to the sheikhs of Tunis into standard Western notation with slight adaptations of the accidentals to accommodate the characteristic neutral intervals of Arab music. These transcriptions provided the original models for successive layers of prescriptive notations, each reflecting individual aspects of interpretation, which were used by the ensemble in teaching and performance. After Tunisian independence in 1956, a version of the RashTdiyya's tran- scriptions was published by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in a series of nine volumes, edited by Sãlah al Mahdl, called Al-turãth al-mûsïqï al-tünisi (The Tunisian Musical Heritage).

Articles • Bruno Netti: "Preface," 3-5. Abstract : The Western tradition of music scholarship - from which the field of ethnomusicology de- rived - began by concentrating on the understanding of musical works as conceived and formulated in notation by composers. To a large extent, historical musicology has retained this emphasis. For long, ethnomusicologists too worked on the assumption that their principal task was the identification of units of musical thought that had consistency and stability - songs, rãga-s , maqãmãt, pieces. Studies of variability such as the comparison of versions of a folk song or of the differing stanzas of one song variant, or the performances of rãga, dastgãh, and maqãm, ordinarily had as their central purpose the identification of the nature of the song or modal entity. Studies of the variability itself, of performance practice and improvisation, remained on the outskirts. Improvisation was linked with oral tradition, and it was sometimes assumed that all music not notated must be in some way improvised. In the 1930s, works outlining these aspects of music and pointing to their significance for scholarship began to ap- pear; Robert Haas's Auffiihrungspraxis der Musik { 1931) and Ernst Ferand's Die Improvisation in der Musik (1938) were landmarks. There emerged, slowly, a body of literature providing theoretical and substantive thought on these processes, sometimes linking them to the nature of aural tradition. • Ali Jihad Racy: "Creativity and Ambience: An Ecstatic Feedback Model from Arab Music," 7-28. Abstract: This article investigates one musician's articulation about creativity, a concept that Western thinkers have generally associated with newness and value, and addressed in three related areas: the agent, or the creative person; the creative process; and the created object. Defining creativity in broad and flexible terms, and recognizing it as a complex phenomenon with cultural, contextual and personal dimensions, this article studies an Arab artist's assessment of his creativity in relation to traditional Arab musical practices and in comparison with a 19th-century European composer's assessment of his own creative work. vol. 33,1991 (3)</page><page sequence="151">2. Contents and Abstracts • 169 • Gregory E. Smith: 'in Quest of a New Perspective on Improvised Jazz: A View from the Balkans," 29-52. Abstract: If formulaic composition is understood as a process of substitution - of creating new phrases on the model of a few basic patterns, rather than repeating a stock of memorized clichés - it can be seen not as something rigid and unimaginative, as it is sometimes characterized, but as a creative pro- cess that differs in distinctive ways from written composition. To fully appreciate the results of such a process requires new sets of assumptions. Much work remains to be done in defining the aesthetic principles that will lead us to a better understanding of music composed in performance. From the model of Milman Parry (1971) and Albert B. Lord's research (1960), the nature of the immediate task is clear: a broader range of compositions needs to be transcribed and analyzed in order to discover the patterns of constraint that shape the composer's choice of language; the patterns of response to those constraints need to be defined and classified; and the circumstances in which players learn and practice their art needs to be more carefully scrutinized. • Margaret J. Kartomi: "Musical Improvisations by Children at Play," 53-65. Abstract: Are the spontaneous utterances of children and the play songs roughly comparable to what adult musicians in Western countries call improvisation and composition, respectively? If so, what do we mean by these terms? And what do they tell us about the creativity of children? I first asked ques- tions such as these in 1969 during a field trip to study and record the music of the children in a shift- ing Pitjantjara settlement which was situated near Yalata on the edge of the Nullarbor Plain in south Australia. • Leo Treitler: "Medieval Improvisation," 66-91. Abstract: The co-existence and interaction of written and unwritten traditions is a premise for the un- derstanding of medieval music cultures. Categorical differences between the music of "written" and "unwritten" traditions are no more characteristic of the greater part of the Middle Ages than are differ- ences between "composed" and "improvised" music. We take advantage of this continuity, in fact, to learn about improvisatory traditions from what has been written down. Even in the late Middle Ages composing, performing, and improvising could all be thought of as a single act. A music master of the 1 3th century writing a handbook instructing performers in the invention at sight of counterpoints to be sung along with chant melodies that were written down states his purpose as teaching how "to compose and perform discant through improvisation."

Abstract: The paper reflects the ongoing discussion in the field of music and gender, especially in context of its definition between feminist theory and a gender-balanced view. The contribution leads to a broader understanding of gender issues in our field and should be understood as an impulse to further discussion. To escape both the new prejudices and the old limits of male-oriented research I am suggesting that we think about the gendered structures of society that sustain and surround musical performance. We must consider the musicians, yes - but also their audiences, both active and passive; the silent ones, the ones who dance, the ones who make "noise," the ones who are paid and praised as well as the ones who take up their own authority to sing out who they are, whether or not they are recognized for it. • Cynthia Tse Kimberlin: "What Am I To Be?

It is very fitting for the tree to be the primary religio-aesthetic theme of the carving on the instruments of a gamelan : its im- age is on the Kayonan the dalang uses as a vehicle for the Gods to enter his body during performance, just as gamelan music serves as the vehicle upon which the Gods descend to the middle world and re- ascend to the upper world during ritual. In both cases, the imagery of the tree of life in the upper world provides a most appropriate environment in the middle world to welcome and receive the Gods. As an aural mandala, gamelan music is an icon of the continuous cosmic process of birth, life, death, and rebirth symbolized by the tree. Explored as a metaphor, gamelan music, with its composite male and female elements, can be seen to continuously recreate the tree: the gongs are the roots of the tree; the kajar, its multi-petaled lotus flower, the kendang, its rhythmic lotus leaves, the pokok instruments, its trunk; the melody and rhythm instruments, its large and small branches; and its bronze bars and gongs are its "flowers" and "leaves." • Roderic C. Knight: "Music Out of Africa: Mande Jaliya in Paris," 52-69. Abstract : Paris is home for all of these musicians, and to see their records in the stores and chart their concert appearances on the European circuit is to believe that this is what African music outside of Africa is all about. But there is more to the picture than record sales, concert appearances, and other features of the music world that catch the attention of the popular press. In this article I look in more detail at what it means to be an African musician in Paris, focusing on the Mande people who do indeed dominate the scene in several ways. It is clear that one must travel not only in Africa, but out of Africa as well to see and hear first-hand the full range of Mande music styles. • Tiago de Oliveira Pinto: "'Making Ritual Drama:' Dance, Music, and Representation in Brazilian Candomblé and Umbanda ," 70-88. Abstract : Every religion needs a way of dramatizing its fundamental spiritual, philosophical, and cul- tural principles which have often been handed down in writing or by word of mouth over hundreds of years. This is necessary if the deeper sense demanded of a religion is to continue to be fulfilled and the religion itself is to continue to exist as a holistic system within a process of social develop- ment. This applies particularly to what has become known as the Afro-Brazilian religions candomblé, candomblé-de-caboclo and umbanda. The various patterns of dramatization existing in these religions and the means of expression employed will be illustrated by examples and in relation to their present religious context.

Abstract : From both sides of the ethnomusicological fence - that divide which marks off insiders and outsiders to the discipline - comes the question: what do refugees or the refugee experience have to do with music? It is a question that calls forth old ghosts (what is ethnomusicology? what does it study?) and gives birth to yet more questions, among them: how do traditions survive - if they do - conditions of dislocation as extreme as those which refugees undergo? Are refugees a demographic category for purposes of ethnomusicological study? Is there anything to be gained from studying music in the con- text of the refugee experience? These questions underlie the papers in this volume. They are questions that will more directly engage this particular contribution (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Ingrid T. Monson: "Forced Migration, Asymmetrical Power Relations and African- American Music: Reformulation of Cultural Meaning and Musical Form," 22-A1 . Abstract. I argue that forced African migration to North America and resettlement conditions under the terms of chattel slavery form the most essential social context affecting the development of African- American cultural life. The historical background of African-American music is briefly examined from the vantage point of the effect of forced migration on the terms of African and European-American mu- sical interaction. The consequences of these terms of interaction, which differ from those of any other immigrant group, are visible throughout American history (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Sue De San Zheng: "Music and Migration: Chinese American Traditional Music in New York," 48-67. Abstract : Chinese American musical life can be examined from many angles. The factors that have shaped and influenced the patterns of Chinese American musical activities can be subjected to different interpretations. Although an approach that combines several perspectives is always likely to be closer to reality, I will for present purposes, focus on the thesis that the diverse experiences of migrants - voluntary and involuntary - are key factors affecting musical choice in resettlement; that those experi- ences of voluntary and involuntary migration played a significant role in fostering different attitudes toward the performance of Chinese traditional music and traditional opera among the Chinese Ameri- can musicians (incl.

Abstract : The examples of preservation over large spans of time and place, and with no continuous in-context practice, support Alan Merriam's assertion that "music is considered to be one of the most stable elements of culture" (1964). Such preservation is accomplished through the process of compart- mentalization, defined by Merriam as a situation in which "people tend to absorb and use two culture systems which are kept separate from one another." But Merriam has assumed that compartmentaliza- tion "may be due to incompatibility of the two music systems." In the case of the Karaites' radical displacement the musical heritage has been carefully insulated precisely against the penetration of any elements of compatible systems which could easily dilute it, like Rabbanite liturgy or Egyptian music (incl.

Abstract : In this paper, change in modern north Indian music performance is examined from the per- spective of one of its most outstanding phenomena, the sitãr. An instrument that appeared in the 1 8th century, rapidly captured the popular imagination and swept to unprecedented dominance during the 19th and 20th centuries, the sitãr practically embodies north India's changing musical tastes. Here a general overview ignores a great many details but surveys the most outstanding and mainstream chang- es in the instrument, its music and its performance context in reference to specific times and locations (incl.

Abstract : By closely examining two " Ãlhã " performances by singers representative of different re- gional traditions, one more traditional and the other more modern, we have seen how much a shared epic tradition can vary in contemporary performance. The extent to which performance styles are tied to regions and types of audiences was dramatically illustrated by two parallel occurrences which took place during the 1983 recitation season. Because it was the 800th anniversary of the historic battle between King Prithviraj and the Chandels of Mahoba, cultural organizers in Bundelkhand had invited " Ãlhã " singers from all over the Hindi area (incl.

Abstract : Bhangra beat, rock bhangra and house bhangra are styles of a re-invented traditional genre, rather than new genres in their own right. Within the space of scarcely more than ten years, bhangra as a folk genre was reinvented in the new style of popular bhangra beat ; this aesthetic shift relied upon the fusion of a public, of musicians, and of producers drawn, in different proportions, from the subconti- nent and from the urban communities migrating from east Africa. The interaction with Afro-Caribbean and Anglo-American styles of popular music, facilitated by the more heterogeneous settlement patters of the English Midlands, gave rise to further aesthetic shifts toward rock bhangra and house bhangra. The emergence of bhangra music as a focal point for an incipient "British Asian" youth culture finally coincided with political aspirations toward a sense of ethnic unity across traditional divides. Bhangra music remains likely, over the next decade, to dominate the south Asian music market and industry in Britain; its entry into the youth culture and popular music market of Britain at large, nonetheless, will continue to face obstacles hard to overcome (incl.

Abstract: Three main conclusions may be drawn: (1) Throughout Oceania, not just the future special- ist but all performers are expected to be competent and to this end engage in formal learning. (2) Most accounts of informal music learning in Oceania refer to children. Adolescents are the main recipients of instruction, and adult learning is accomplished largely by rehearsal. (3) Not just religious music but any music which for whatever reason is judged important is subject to formal learning in Oceania, ei- ther by instruction or by rehearsal. Common contexts for both instruction and rehearsal are ritual and ceremony, festivals, contests, and new composition (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Richard M. Moyle: "The Polynesian Nose Flute," 29-48. Abstract : (The pre-contact close association of the Polynesian nose flute ( kofe , 'ofe, hohe, or ohe) with personal entertainment rendered it vulnerable to European musical instruments - particularly the guitar and ukulele - having the same primary function. The historical evidence suggests that the rise in popular- ity of the one was matched by a decline of the other. The additional uses of the flute - courting, awakening sleeping royalty, accompanying song and dance - were co-casualties of missionary and other forms of European influence. It is probably no coincidence that the last competent players in an unbroken tradition of performance practice - in Tonga and Niue - were or are all elderly persons, virtually ignored by those around them, and sustained by little more than nostalgia. Time will determine whether the Hawaiian flute can create for itself an enduring and meaningful cultural niche among even more intense forms of the same outside influences which led to its earlier decline (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Gerald Florian Messner: "The Shark-Calling Ceremony in Paruai, New Ireland, Papua New Guinea," 49-83. Abstract: The aim of this study is not to provide a detailed account of the whole shark-calling cer- emony in Paruai, but, rather, an understanding of its admirably beautiful songs. The songs, on the other hand, do not start to exist when the shark-caller begins to sing but are a most important and indispens- able function of this magico-religious performance of existence within the Malanggan-cult[ure]. For this reason, major aspects of this religious fishing ceremony, although not explicitly musical, have to be discussed here. In spite of the fact that the ceremony sometimes differs remarkably from area to area, from village to village, from clan to clan and sub-clan to sub-clan, the major core structure remains the same and has been carefully and vividly portrayed by Glenys Koehnke.

I, therefore, will complement her ritualistic details of the tradition of Paruai, which differ significantly from Koehnke 's account of Kontu. I will add only details which have not yet been recorded and reported by others and which will provide a more com- prehensive understanding of this unique and genuine tradition (incl.

Abstract : The systematic way Melanesians choose an anti-clockwise direction when they make cir- cling movements, in daily life as much as in formalized ritual or dance (whether they are aware of it or not), is a fact that has also been under the noses of observers - ethnographers, missionaries, traders and administrators (not forgetting the occasional ethnomusicologist) - for 150 years. And yet, while it may seem such an obvious, consistent Melanesian customary habit after one's attention has been drawn to it, the fact of it has been commented upon so rarely - and continues to be ignored - that I must confess it took me six years before I had the gumption to ask for a local Melanesian explanation, in 1977 - six long years after my first fieldwork in the archipelago!

Abstract. The question is: Can legal measures contribute to the raising of financial means for the safe- guarding of traditional music? Can such measures provide funds for the preservation of traditional music - for the archivation and documentation or even for the revitalization of traditional music? The international debate on the protection of traditional music is not based on such trivial considerations as I am presenting here, but on rather lofty ideas, whose importance I certainly don't want to underes- timate. Thus, a very recent draft of a "Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Folklore" which was submitted to a Committee of Experts convened by UNESCO in April 1989, stresses the principles that should govern future action in this field. This UNESCO document underlines the importance of folk- lore "as an integral part of cultural heritage and living culture," recognizes "the extreme fragility of traditional forms of folklore" and stresses "the danger which it faces from external factors" (UNESCO 1989: Annex III).</page><page sequence="160">178 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) the world of music 31,1 989 (3) / die welt der musik / le monde de la musique. Film and Video in Ethnomusicology. Editor: Max Peter Baumann; Assistant Editor: Ulrich Wegner. Review Editor: Habib Hassan Tourna. Florian Noetzel Verlag. Wilhelmshaven 1989. 132 pp. ISSN 0043-8774. Articles • John Baily: "Filmmaking as Musical Ethnography," 3-20. Abstract : The fact that ethnomusicologists largely ignored the implications of Mantle Hood's fiat is partly explained by factors Hood himself identified: lack of qualified personnel and the expense of working with 1 6mm film, at that time the most readily available visual medium for documentary work. They may have been put off by the rather grand technical level Hood took for granted, such as advo- cating the use of two or three cameras simultaneously - "I suppose one camera is better than none at all" (Feld 1976). Perhaps more important has been the confusion and lack of understanding about the nature of film communication - matters discussed by Feld - and the lack of academic respectability consequently afforded the "ethnomusicologist-filmmaker" by other ethnomusicologists. In anthropol- ogy this problem has to some extent been overcome with the development of the sub-discipline of visual anthropology, where the value of filmmaking is taken for granted and is not at issue. However, an unfortunate side-effect of this has been the marginalization of filmmaking within anthropology (Hughes-Freeland 1989). In contrast, one would wish to see the use of film in ethnomusicology become a matter of central concern to ethnomusicologists (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Oskar Elschek: "Film and Video in Ethnomusicological Research," 21-37. Abstract Audio-visual documentation in ethnomusicology must be considered in a wider context of research. Such documentation is only one element of the larger ethnomusicological and film-related concept. It depends on the following areas, which we must take into account: (1 ) Field work methodol- ogy in general; (2) Film theory or audio-visual media theory; (3) Ethnographical film and anthropol- ogy of visual communication; (4) Audio-visual techniques and technologies. These aspects can help to develop a concept of using audiovisual media in ethnomusicology (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Artur Simon: "The Eye of the Camera. On the Documentation and Interpretation of Music Cultures by Audiovisual Media," 38-55. Abstract : Films about the playing of musical instruments can serve as a valuable document for an internal analysis of musical process. It is not surprising that this kind of analysis was first developed in African musicology. Internal analysis starts with the inner process of a musical performance, for example the playing technique of an instrument or the movements of hand clappers or dancers. The external analyzer tries to transcribe the totality of the musical event as he/she hears it in his/her head- phone. After this one tries to find out the inner structure of this sequence, often not aware of the total event. In contrast, the internal analysis starts with the inner structure of a musical performance, i.e. with its different parts and how single elements are played, and after this, these elements are composed to a total picture (incl.

Abstract : I am a professional filmmaker and have been running an independent film production com- pany in Tokyo for over eighteen years. For the past twelve years, my company has been producing music-related films and videos. In this article, I would like to discuss some of our experiences in filming traditional music, focusing particularly upon the relationship between ethnomusicologist and professional filmmaker in this process. Recognizing the impact of film and video on the public, ethno- musicologists have become increasingly involved in filmmaking and sometimes find themselves turn- ing to professionals for help in the filming and editing processes. I would like to describe some of the problems that can arise in creating audio-visual works, specifically when an ethnomusicologist works with a professional production group, and to make some suggestions for avoiding those problems (incl.

Multipart Singing in Three East Florinese Villages Fifty Years Later: A Preliminary investigation, 3-51. Abstract : The admirable musical culture of East Flores is still present in actual performance. Jaap Kunst's investigations can still be seen today as a valuable source for information on fieldwork meth- ods used in the 1930s as well as an overall account on musical activities and genres although he missed out sociocultural details of music making. This particular presentation of a preliminary documentation of some aspects of the vocal multipart tradition in three East Florinese villages are the result of a pains- taking interaction with aspects of a living cultural whole (a paradox in itself). I am fully aware, that my (our) methodological approach, still affected by Euro-American positivism and objectivism, mainly discloses our processing of a music which means so much to those who perform and perceive it as a vital activity of their cultural life. The indigenous world of appreciation, perception, and meaning of it, still remains inaccessible to our ethnomusicological methods (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Tullia Magrini: "Group Dimension in Traditional Music," 52-79. Abstract The acknowledgement of a group dimension in musical events of traditional cultures is not uncommon in recent ethnomusicological literature. For example, John Blacking's statement (1973) that music is a product of the behavior of human groups, irrespective of their degree of organization, points to the importance of the group dimension in musical activity. From this perspective, I will deal here with a group-oriented study of the sonorous activity in some cultures dominated by oral transmis- sion (also referring to Bion's psychoanalytic group theory, 1961-81), assuming that this approach may provide fresh insights into the musical phenomena involved (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé ). • Max Peter Baumann: "The Musical Performing Group: Musical Norms, Tradition, and Identity," 80-13. Abstract : The musical group is primarily to be defined as an assembly of two or more acting individu- als who play their own music or the music of others on the basis of certain concepts about music. The elements of these actions are: to perform (produce/create), to consume (receive/listen), to distribute (transmit/mediate), and/or to evaluate (criticize/analyze) music. By the dominance of individual activi- ties within a musical group, we can simultaneously differentiate between these aspects of performing, consuming, transmitting, and evaluating behavior which are linked to specific musical values, norms, and identity constructs (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Christian Kaden: "Cultural Diversity: A Challenge to the World of Music," 1 14-42. Abstract Are musical cultures, as found in modern industrial nations, formed manifold indeed? Wouldn't it be a more suitable characterization of them to concentrate on their mass reproduction of commercial norms and standard values? Why should "range and diversity" be considered positive val- ues anyway? How much diversity can a culture take without disintegrating into a world full of dispari- ties, into a complete cultural patchwork? And by what criteria would one actually measure diversity? Are the musical forms of expression that exist together within one culture all of an equal value, all equally worthy of preservation? What, in modern times, is the state of affairs in respect to the inheri- tance of ancient, archaic musical forms - indeed, of "older music" in general? Can it be integrated into contemporary forms of musical expression even if only with little prospect of success? Must it remain a natural monument, an exotic ornament? (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé ).

Abstract : Various factors have contributed to the surge of the home-made banjo industry: (a) the dis- appearance of factory-made banjos from shops since the 1 960s, partly due to changing fashions and partly a result of the general economic decline of wide areas of this region. During the 1970s and mid- 1980s, the major cities underwent an identical experience: acoustic guitars and banjos had totally dis- appeared from the market, and even guitar strings were unobtainable. Furthermore, the increasingly ex- pensive guitars with electric amplification are beyond the means of most present-day musicians (unless a powerful sponsoring organization backs them), let alone for township and village youngsters who age from ten to sixteen years. On the other hand, the operation of the mass media continues to ensure that youngsters of this age group in particular are heavily exposed to current musical trends in the region, as well as to the "international" pop music scene. To snatch a share of a musical world otherwise beyond their reach has always been an irresistible urge of the poor township boy; the home-made string instru- ment is both a symptom and an available solution (incl.

This paper presents the translation of a conversation with Joseph Shabalala, leader of the world renowned South African isicathamiya choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Few such interviews with outstanding African musicians have as yet been published and even fewer studies have addressed the theoretical problems involved in the use of individual African performers' oral testimony as sources of life stories and biographies. The publication of this conversation represents a first step towards a fuller appreciation of this outstanding musician's work, and at the same time forms part of a wider project to recapture and evaluate the live experiences and creative output of such remarkable talents vol.31, 1989(1)</page><page sequence="164">182 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) in South Africa's black musical history as Reuben Caluza, Solomon Linda, Enoch Mzobe, and many others (incl.

Abstract : The effects of apartheid ideology have had lasting and devastating implications for Indian South African cultures. Aside from the recurring moods despair and the restriction on cultural ex- change on an international scale, physical constraints on cultural forces have been disastrous. Com- munities have been split up and members dispersed over a twenty-five kilometer radius. People who had previously been within walking or bussing distances were now completely out of touch with one another. Groups of musicians who had been playing together regularly were broken up and developing systems of patrons were interrupted. Although categorized arbitrarily as an amorphous homogeneous group political and bureaucratic expedience, Indian South Africans represent a dynamic collection of well-defined groups, many of whom vacillate quite comfortably between indo-centric and euro-centric environments. Many are also dedicated and patriotic South Africans wishing to seek solutions to the present political impasse, despite the abysmal repression they have suffered in the country of their birth (incl.

Abstract : The repertoires of the great black singers of the 1940s and 1950s reflected both their indig- enous roots and their urban experience. Traditional Nguni and Sotho melodies were flanked by popular American blues and jazz numbers, as well as some of the "formula" songs of mbaqanga and mbube. The narrative element in black music-making has always been central. While the traditional songs told stories of heroes and customs, many of their own compositions expressed new ideologies regarding gender. They sang of changing values and relationships; of their new-found sexual freedom and their disregard for old-style respectability and submission to men. The uncrowned queen of Sophiatown jazz was the beautiful Dolly Rathebe, an orphan whose musical background came from singing in So- phiatown churches, weddings and funerals where shebeen queens, prostitutes, murderers, and thieves united to mourn and sing together. But success brought her, as it did many of the black female idols, into frequent contact with the endemic violence of township society. Today, however, she is one of the few older women who still has a viable career and is revered by the stars of the new generation. Another "great" from the Sophiatown era, was veteran jazz singer Thandi Mpambane Klaasen. She too was considered a sex symbol and role model. Of course the best known of Johannesburg's black singers was Miriam Makeba, whose first employment was a domestic servant. Makeba experienced her share of the humiliation of being black in a white racist society; despite she had won considerable acclaim from white audiences. The spirit of Sophiatown has survived, and many of its women, from the shebeen to the beauty queens and performers, have formed the backbone of a new generation of black women who are ready to take their place in post-apartheid South Africa (incl.

Abstract : In this article I shall focus on one aspect of this early history, although I shall argue that this aspect comprises one of the primary modes of representing the music of the Other to European audi- ences completely unfamiliar with the sounds of other musics, much less the panoply of music's cultural roles as reported by each new ethnographic discoverer. My specific focus is the visual representation of non-European music, the images that were virtually never absent from missionary accounts of music and music-making. These images assumed a number of distinctive forms, which, in turn, conveyed meaning in different ways. Musicians appeared in the act of performance, tucked in the far corner of a ritual performance depicted in an engraving, or as staged characters modeling some sort of iconic costume. Both the human and non-human sides of music-making appear in these images. Etchings, sketches, invented orthographies, seemingly incidental marginalia - all served as the images of non- Western music that became increasingly familiar to those Europeans who read and whose world-view was shaped by published books and pamphlets (incl.

One of the problems most discussed in every sector of musical iconography relates to the reasons for the continuity of representation of an iconic theme, of a pictorial or plastic motif, or of a particular "object" (whether it is a musical instrument, a manner or occasion of making music, an atti- tude linked to musical practice, etc.). In fact, in the specific sphere of representation of musical charac- ter there is reflected a general question of iconography tout court: the persistence in time of a pictorial element can be explained by the equally unaltered "vitality" of the fragment of reality of which it is the faithful reflection; but at the same time it can be observed that it is the cultural "fortune" of a figurative form that acts as the cause of its repetition, by the various means of copying, citation, remake, tribute to tradition, etc. To the problem of temporal continuity one can add the problem of diffusion in geo- graphical space: here again it may be that where one representation is similar to others their common origin is to be found outside pictorial tradition in the strict sense; or there is the problem of ascertain- ing the possible transference, the "exportation" of the formal image from one work to another (incl.

It entails questions about the nature of intellectual objectivation and about our social and aesthetical preconditions. To solve them one will have to go back to the origins of historicism and ethnographic interest in the 1 8th and 1 9th centuries and in particular to Rezeptionsgeschichte , the study of the recep- tion of music by critics, writers, and artists. It was the interest in these problems which prompted a few Italian colleagues and me to organize in spring 1988 a Conference on "Northern Mediterranean Folk Music in the Visual Arts." The material which I collected for my own contribution to the occasion - pictorial and literary sources from 1780 to 1835 - turned out to be vast and divided itself into a major part, Germanic sources ranging from the Storm and Stress period to Classicism to Romanticism, and a minor part, material clustered around Léopold Robert, a painter from the French part of Switzerland and an exponent of French classicism. He is the theme of this essay (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumě). • David Wateerhouse: "Woodcut Prints by Suzuki Harunobu as a Source for the History of Japanese Dance," 85-107. Abstract : Old Japanese woodcuts of dance can be grouped broadly into four categories: (1) prints de- picting historical dances; (2) prints of festival dances whether religious or secular; (3) prints of theatre dance, especially kabuki dance; and (4) prints showing private entertainment dance. Examples in this article are taken from the work of Suzuki Harunobu (1725-70), the first great artist of the full color woodcut in Japan. Many of the themes of later 18th and earlier 19th century figure prints are treated already in his art; and later artists often followed his lead consciously or unconsciously. In turn, he himself drew on pictorial resources available to him in the black-and-white picture books of his prede- cessors, as well as on earlier woodcuts using only two color blocks. Such use of earlier models, which are often difficult to pin-point today, was common in ukiyoe (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumě). Book Reviews • Hans Oesch: "Richard Moyle.

Abstract: The music-making referred to here is that of a minority group, driven off the lands it once possessed and dispersed to various corners of the land where it survives in a form of "urban clusters." Though the census carried out by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics in 1980 regis- tered 2,479 rural residents, it is necessary to consider the continuous trend among the fishermen and their families to move into cities, in order to look for better living conditions. From this population group with a particular tendency to migrate, I was able to observe 30 musical nuclea and of a perma- nent corps of about 100 musicians, a significant fact considering that the Caiçara musical heritage has been considerably compromised by urbanization. But, despite the disruption that has been thrust upon the coastal communities, we have observed that they have been able to retain a common identity that guarantees the preservation of their cultural heritage. In their musical practices and languages, the Caiçaras have maintained habits that allow us to typify their speech and music. The latter is preserved and transmitted to youngsters through the family that functions as a "musical preservation unit." (incl.

Abstract : The dramatic play bumba-meu-boi, the brincadeira ("play," "amusement") of bumba-meu- boi as it is called by the participants, traditionally celebrates the life, death, and resurrection of the bull. Dating from the last decades of the eighteenth century, the event, originally linked to cattle breeding in the northeastern region of Brazil, has expanded throughout the country, achieving considerable aes- thetic and social significance. The word bumba, from the Congolese, means to beat or to strike. When the bull, the main character of the play, draws back or moves forward in its dance, it is accompanied by a beat on the zabumba (bass drum). Bumba-meu-boi, then means "Zabumba-my-buH" or "Strike! Charge, my bull!" Dance, theater, music, poetry, and other oral and visual displays, glorify and praise the powerful image of the bull. Luis da Câmara Cascudo classifies bumba-meu-boi as an instrument of social criticism used by the underprivileged social classes against the prevailing system (incl.

A good mestre de capueira has to know how to sing, play an instrument, and command a roda. He has to know how to "equip" a roda, lead a jogo , begin, carry on, and end. All capueiristas belonged to an order, since capueira became an extention of candomblé. Ogum, the war deity of the Afro-Bahian religious candomblé belief system, is the protector of capueiras. This connection is so clear that the so called "Angola cry" which all capoeira mestres use throughout the roda performances, is nothing but Ogum's "war scream:" liéééé ... which manifests itself during the candomblé ceremony through the tongue of the possessed medium (incl.

Index and bibliography comprise almost the entire period of Ivan Vandor's edi- torship. When Ivan Vandor gave a new concept to the Journal in 1977, focus-sing "on aspects of the musical traditions of the world," he simultaneously began to place an ethnomusicological approach in the foreground, step by step.Within the last eleven years, 240 articles were published on selected topics - from a descriptive as well as from a theoretical point of view. Most of the issues of the journal focused on special topics which were devoted to particular regions of the world: "The Arab World" (1978/1), "Latin America" (1982/2), "Japan" (1983/1), "China" (1985/1), and "Korea" (1985/2). Mu- sic and religion was a theme centered on in issues about "Sacred Music I/II (1982/3; 1984/3) and "Islam" (1986/3). Four specific issues concentrated on miscellaneous topics, i.e., "Orient-Occident Encounters" (1978/2), "Masks I/II" (1980/1 ; 1981/3), and "Children's Music and Musical Instruments" (1987/3). Over and above eight issues dealing with a wide variety of different subjects, a forum was created for scholars to debate on theoretical concepts of "Universais I/II (1977/1; 1984/2), "Symbol- ism in Music" (1979/3), "Aesthetics" (1983/3), "Mechanism of Change" (1986/1), and "Musicology/ vol. 30, 1988(1)</page><page sequence="169">2.

Abstract: The present topic requires a few remarks on terminology before we can proceed to discuss the actual field data." Categories in English such as "music," "dance," "games," and even ubiquitous words such as "children," which are believed to have a universal meaning, do not necessarily have lin- ear equivalents in the languages of the area concerned. We have to clarify, therefore, (1) whether any terms in the Eastern Angolan languages are comparable in their semantic field to the English notions mentioned, and how they are delineated; (2) in which manner people of different ages are categorized and whether there is a concept comparable to "child" as understood in Western languages; (3) to what extent it is possible then to speak of "children's music and musical instruments" as categories in their own right and "to underline affinities, and, in particular, divergences with the adults' repertoire,... as well as the possible relationship of the music to children's games."

The first of these is the concern of the school-children alone ( 1 st-9th school grades) and takes place out of doors without the presence of any adults; the second part is carried through by each class in their respective classrooms and under the direction or supervision of the teachers. Out of doors, the school-children take part voluntarily and are not organized in any way; in the classrooms, participation in the orga- nized entertainment activities is compulsory. Until school begins at 8 o'clock, the pupils rove about while it is still dark, either alone or in small groups, these not being decided upon until just one day before the Schulsilvester begins. This "roving about in the streets" as a New Year's Eve delight of the children of Zurich caught the attention of David von Moos as far back as 1775 already (incl.

Some of the children's musical instruments and musical playthings feature a pure ethnic affiliation while others have penetrated on different paths directly from the international instrumental fund or are made on the model of the latter. The children - mainly those who live in villages - make their instruments and playthings themselves because the nature surrounding them offers the necessary materials which are nonexistent in town or are present only to a very limited extent (incl.

Observations on earlier, largely archaeological data have been provided elsewhere (e.g. Chon 1957, Lee 1974, Song 1984 and 1985). The two major indicators of Chinese in- fluence are organological and stylistic. The first is easy to describe, the second simple enough on the surface but rather more complex and obscure underneath (incl.

Abstract: Within Oriental music, the question of intervals is the chief preoccupation of all theoreti- cians; intervals are the very substance of modes which, in their turn, determine the whole ethos and aesthetics of music. Moreover, it is the intervals that constitute music as an object of scientific thought. It is, therefore, understandable that such major importance be given to the study of musical intervals by Islamic scholars, inheritors of the scientific thought of the Greeks. In India the situation is roughly simi- lar. On the other hand, one way of defining Islamic tradition, to which the Persian, Turkish, and Arabian Orient are connected, is by means of its relationship to the transcendental which, more than any other question, has preoccupied theosophists and spirituals from the very beginning. These conceptions are common to all "people of the Book" (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) and stand in particular con- trast to those of India and Greece (incl.

Within a few years of its introduction in the 1970s, cassette production has become a major music industry challenging all existing music-media. The spectacular growth of the Egyptian cassette industry raises many questions. This article will briefly examine the rise of the Egyptian cassette industry within the context of pre-existent music media, the characteristics of Egyptian cassette companies and their commercial strategies, the economic and legal framework within which the Egyptian cassette industry operates, and the processes of cassette produc- tion. A few observations will also be offered on the music recorded on cassettes and responses to it, as well as some aspects of the relationships between the cassette industry, live performance, and other music media (incl.

The theme of the song which recurs or is hinted at in the refrain is death and the vanity of worldly riches, for mortality is the fate of all. And so, runs the song, one must trust in the providence of God, who watches over all, even lowly chickens as they scratch a living among the withered banana leaves or goats tethered in the open field where predators lurk. This song was found in the repertory of the various musical ensembles of the court of Buganda, formerly the largest and most powerful of the Bantu kingdom states in the inter-lacustrine area of east-central Africa (incl.

I claim that it does not matter so much which particular works or genres of music are taught, but rather what attitude towards music is being conveyed to children and young people; because what matters is their perspective in regard to music even making them aware of how their perspective may influence their appreciation and judgment. • Tiago de Oliveira Pinto: "'Art is Universal.'

Art music alone (musica de arte) can become the general musical heritage of the whole of the mankind. Such an art form, therefore, which in this way, through the artistic individuality of the composer, once more becomes collective music but at another level, ultimately harbors within itself, then - according to Villa-Lobos - the power to serve mankind as a binding instrument of peace. • IMC/CIM/IMR, 117-120.</page><page sequence="173">2.

Abstract : And since the term is relative, might the "ologies" also include the non-exotic? I guess so. Then what is the difference between musicology and ethnomusicology? Well... there's a difference ... history! That's it! Historical musicology! Do you mean that historical method is not used by ethno- musicology? That's what I mean. Well, most of the time, it's not. Sometimes it's not.... The German term "Vergleichende Musikwissenschaft'" was rather freely translated "comparative musicology." Jaap Kunst changed it to "ethnomusicology." Does musicology employ comparative method? Certainly! Then, as Professor Harrison put it, all musicology, in fact, is ethnomusicology. • John Rahn: "Ethnomusicological Approaches to Western Art Music: A Native Reflection," 9-17. Abstract : Ethnomusicologists think and behave basically as observers; they do not participate in the sense that composers, performers, and theorists participate in their music-cultural process. The music theorist, say, studies music in order to participate in its recreation and indigenous conceptualization; the ethnomusicologist participates in order to study. It's very humanly important and satisfying to be an active participant, to be an authentic member of a society or culture. Might this help explain ethno- musicologists' preoccupation with defining their discipline? Like the composer, the ethnomusicologist is attracted to music that is not his, or not yet his. Yet, contrary to its original impulse, ethnomusicology focusses on the typical and unexceptional within the alien music culture. At least for one ethnomusi- cologist, "our area of concentration is music that is accepted by an entire society as its own, and we reserve a lesser role for the personal, the idiosyncratic, the exceptional.... We are most interested in what is typical of a culture (Netti 1983). (incl. Kurzfassung/ Résumé). • Stephen Blum: "On the Disciplines and Arts of Music," 19-32. Abstract : "General musicology" is understood here as a heterogeneous field of inquiry, sustained by dialogue among scholars and musicians in all parts of the world and by frequent comparisons of the- ories, methods, and findings. We cannot expect agreement on criteria for identifying "music" and "musicians," and we must acknowledge that methods will differ according to the interests of scholars working in various regions. In the late 20th century, no single statement of the scope, method, and aims of musicology will prove acceptable to practitioners and observers of the discipline the world over. Divergent though they often appear, the concerns and procedures of musicologists are connected in so many ways that we may speak both of "general musicology" and "regional musicologies" and of sev- eral specialized disciplines of fields, each cultivated by scholars who maintain relatively close contact with one another (incl.

In fact, ethnomusicology has already developed the study of uses and functions of ethnic mu- sic in its own field of investigation to a considerable degree. The sociology of music has to contribute to this study in art music in order to help music history, the social history of music and, indirectly, eth- nomusicology to better understand and grasp their object from this point of view. At the present state of research, ethnomusicology and the sociology of music can help each other in this field, ethnomusicol- ogy bringing first of all a richer articulation of numerous functions it discovers in ethnic music on the vol. 29, 1987 (1)</page><page sequence="174">192 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) factual level and the sociology of music a deeper insight into various uses and functions of both art and ethnic music as they can be viewed from the sociological standpoint (inch Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Benjamin Suchoff: "Ethnomusicological Roots of Béla Bartók's Musical Language," 43-65.

Abstract : There is no such thing as multicultural music, unless one is speaking of repertoires or styles representing the fusion of two or more music cultures or idioms. So, an individual music culture, or style, would have to serve as a reference and provide a repertoire for instruction. It is assumed that the musical development "of an individual cannot exist without a cultural tradition through which it may be expressed" (Blacking 1 97 1 : 1 9). There is no question that such a list of between-culture universais may be far from the mark. The identification of "generic" competences such as these, however, might encourage musicians in training to be aware of ( 1 ) what, from a global perspective, they know how to do well, (2) a range of possibilities open to them, and (3) an awareness of music systems other people embrace (incl.

Pacholczyk: "Music and Islam in Indonesia," 3-12. Abstract : The subject of Islamic influence in music in Indonesia is among the least studied among both Indonesian and Western scholars, as their attention was primarily directed toward the gamelan traditions of Java and Bali. To my knowledge, no serious study has been done on that subject to date. We know of some musical instruments that appeared in Indonesia together with the advent of Islam and that they are used in a variety of ensembles. The wooden shawm, traditionally associated with Is- lamic culture, is found in many parts of Indonesia. As saronen it is the principal and the only melodic instrument in the ensembles gamelan seronen or gamelan tetet in East Java and in Madurese gamelan kerrabhan and as selompret in gamelan reyog of East Java (Crawford 1980). A similar instrument, called tarompet is a part of gěndang pěnca ensemble in Sunda (West Java) accompanying the dance pěnca (Harrell 1980). In Sumatra the shawm is named sarunai or sarune. Other Near Eastern instru- ments used in a variety of ensembles in Sumatra are gambus - a seven string plucked lute, rabana - a frame drum, and bangsi - a six-or seven-hole flute (Hood 1980). Another example is the rebab, a two or three string spike lute. Some authors consider it of Arabo-Persian origin (Heins 1980), others point to its existence in a historical Javanese gamelan munggang under the name gending, suggesting that the instrument itself predates the advent of Islam and that only the name is of Arab origin (Hood 1970).

Abstract : As in other Muslim countries, Islam in Minangkabau bans music in the mosques, apart from simple, unaccompanied chants of the Qur 'ãn which neither offer sensual pleasure nor obscure the meaning of the texts. However, several forms of devotional group music-making outside the mosques have been transplanted and developed over the centuries. The only instruments allowed are double- headed drums, frame drums (tambourines), brass trays and a lute which are mostly played by the musicians in accompaniment to their own singing. It is widely believed that these musical forms were transplanted long ago from Muslim India or the Middle East, mainly by local or foreign missionaries who used them to disseminate Islam throughout West Sumatra. The most popular forms are indang and salwat dulang (Minangkabau: salawek dulang, salawek talam), but dikir, malaud ( dabuik ), gambus (name of the pear-shaped lute,) are also found (incl.

Abstract I describe various situations in Afghanistan which involve both musical and religious ele- ments and discuss the Afghan perception and interpretation of these situations, and come to the con- clusion that Islam is so integral to the lives of the Afghans, that virtually every activity is tinged with religious meaning; musical activities provide no exceptions. Religiously praiseworthy as well as un- praiseworthy behavior is permeated with religious symbols, meaning, and interpretation. On the other hand, no matter how musical a performance may be in the abstract, it is not considered music if the in- tent is religious. For example, in speaking of religious recitation which is often sung to melodic modes, there is the Islamic belief "that, in sharp contrast to Western assumptions, melody and vocal artistry do not necessarily involve music" (Nelson 1985).

Abstract The Alevi believe that putting on the cloak of outward piety, engaging in daily prayer, mak- ing the pilgrimage to Mecca are merely external pretenses. A more intimate and immediate experience of God can be attained through ritual remembrance (dhikr) and the use of music and dance as aids to spiritual catharsis. The orthodox clergy, however, were incensed by such practices, finding the use of music blasphemous, especially in the context of religious activities. And so the story of the 18th cen- tury poet Dertli who was reprimanded for his musical preoccupations by the kadi of Beypazan who ordered: "Go, smash your saz and throw it out! You are forbidden to play it because it contains the devil!" (Borrel 1947). (incl.

Abstract Iqra'{" read!," "recite!") - this request is the beginning of the first verse of Sura 19 of the Qur aw.Together with the following verses, it probably represents the first of the divine revelations received by the prophet Muhammad (Paret 1980). In this first revelation, the prophet was not charged to follow the course of the hariîf, the solitary seeker after God in seclusion, but to proclaim aloud the message of the revelations, and to work towards a rapid propagation of the true faith among his con- temporaries. The texts of his revelations formed a completely new category of literary expression. They were of divine origin and embodied the word of a single, almighty God. They were neither to be compared with the texts of the pre-Islamic poets nor to be placed on the same level as the prophecies of the heathen soothsayers 0 kuhhan ), although they couched these prophecies into rhymed prose (saj0), as Muhammad did reciting his first revelations. The divine nature of the revelations turned each testimony into an untouchable document (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Lois Lamyã' Al Färüql: "The Mawlid," 79-89. Abstract The mawlid is a celebratory event and genre to be found in Muslim lands from the Atlantic coast of Africa all the way to Indonesia and the southern islands of the Philippines. Many spellings and pronunciations have been given to the title of this religious literary form and its various embel- lishments: mevlit, mevlut, maulud, malid, milad, molid, and mulid being but a partial listing. That term has carried many different meanings. Derived from the Arabic root verb wulida ("to be born") mawlid means "the event of birth" or "the place of birth." In these literal senses, it applies to any birth. More specifically, however, it has denoted the birth, the birthday or the birthplace of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad. With this meaning, it is also rendered as mawlid al-nabl i. e. "Birthday of the Prophet." The honor and respect accorded to Muhammad as the spiritual and temporal model for human behav- ior gave rise to a third use of the term mawlid. It became the designation for annual celebrations of the Prophet's birthday. By derivation, mawlid sometimes also names similar celebrations honoring other respected religious leaders. The celebrations honoring the Prophet are enhanced by the retell- ing of events from his life as well as recitations praising his qualities and deeds. These narrative and poetic recitations, also called mawlids, involve solo chants and hymn singing. In some communities the mawlid also incorporates examples of instrumental accompaniment, body movements and/or gala</page><page sequence="177">2. Contents and Abstracts • 195 processions. Mawlid therefore is a term which means: (1) the event or place of a birth; (2) the birth, birthplace or birthday of the Prophet; (3) the celebratory event connected with the Prophet's birth or other important occasions; and (4) the aesthetic forms or genres which enhance such celebrations. It is its use as celebratory event and as aesthetic form that the mawlid will be defined and described here (incl. Kurzfassung/Rěsumé). Book Reviews • Josef Kuckertz: "Charles Capwell.

From this point of view, the similarity of their approach is striking. This similarity, however, is a superficial one. The theses and commentaries of each of the authors, separated by an interval of twenty years, are concerned with two somewhat distinct areas: musical anthropology in one case and ethnomusicology in the other (incl.

Abstract : One feature that has often been allied to modernization is the emergence of entertainers who present folk music packaged for tourists, the media, or an urban society in which the tendency towards vocational specialism has removed much music from communal activities. In Korea this is apparent in the distinction between two strata of folk songs - t 'osok and t 'ongsok - that has at its root acknowledgement of such professional entertainers. T'osok refers to local customs, and includes songs developed and used by the rural populace to accompany labor, entertainment, and rituals. In usage it is often slightly derogatory and suggests allegiance to a lifestyle considered outmoded. T' ongsok refers to songs that are popular and, by extension, widespread, given as entertainment for people to listen to. The terms t 'osok and t 'ongsok have only been adopted by scholars in the last twenty years: from the 1 940s, the related term hyangt'o minyo was applied to local songs; in 1965, ch'ang minyo was first used to denote songs that followed the highly specialized vocal style characteristic of p 'ansori (epic storytell- ing through song), thus covering songs promoted before a paying audience. T'osok and t 'ongsok must therefore post-date 1965, but prior to this they had wide usage in China, where they shared equivalent denotation but were applied mainly to folk stories and popular literature. And, despite their recent introduction to Korea, two similar categories have been historically maintained in the conception of Korean people. This is evident in local terminology for bands: as an all-embracing term, nongak is the name for their music, but other terms such as p 'an 'gut and maegut are used to signify extremes of en- tertainment and ritual orientation (incl.

Abstract : The expression of grief in connection with the loss of life is subjected to culturally prescribed controls and distinctions. Certain religious precepts advocate man's acceptance of destiny and God's will. The Islamic book al-Hadïth expressed disdain toward al-walwalah or "wailing," at funerals, con- sidering it incompatible with true faith. The authoritative book also presented statements against fe- male dirge singers as well as against singing altogether, particularly as a vocation. This may be one of several reasons why, in Lebanon today, funeral singing, a secular art form going back to pre-Islamic Arabia, is atypical of the Sunnites, or orthodox Muslims, most of whom inhabit the coastal cities (incl.

Articles • John Blacking: "Identifying Processes of Musical Change," 3-14. Abstract : Musical change, like all aspects of cultural change, is neither subject to laws nor the in- evitable consequence of happenings. Musical and cultural changes are not caused by culture contact, population movements, or changes in technology and in means and modes of production: they are the results of decisions made by individuals about music-making and music or about social and cultural practice, on the basis of their experiences of music and social life and their attitudes to them in different social contexts (incl.

Abstract : Over the last fifteen years my research work in Northeast Brazil has given me the opportunity to focus my attention on musical change and continuity in the area of traditional Afro-Bahian religious music. While candomblé (the generic designation of popular religion combining African, Amerindian vol. 28, 1986 (1)</page><page sequence="180">198 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) and Catholic belief systems and practices) is found throughout the state of Bahia, the main dogmatic forces of the traditional candomblé centers are found in and around the city of Salvador, the capital of the state. The regional, strongly African-related religious groups ("nations" is the native category) known as the Gêge-Nagôs and the Congo-Angola live side by side with the Caboclos whose religious cultural systems belong, by and large, to local, native traditions. In addition, the Umbanda cult groups which represent genuine expressions of national popular religions have multiplied considerably in the city since the early 1960s and have been seen as a direct threat to the continuity of the regional groups. Already in the early 1970's I noticed that recent stylistic changes in the music of the Caboclo cult and the constant elaboration of the repertory of the Umbanda groups illustrate the cultural integration of the northeastern area, that is, the effective penetration of national values into a strong regional and urban cultural setting. I also hypothesize that the Caboclo and Umbanda cults were becoming a group- identity symbol acceptable to the majority of Afro-Brazilians in the city of Salvador because the nature of their expressions tended to fill the gap between the traditional regional candomblé and the national cult current (incl.

Hymn-singing, on the other hand, was both allowed and encouraged. The impact upon indigenous music was profound. The present paper examines mis- sionary reasons for such prohibitions, assesses the results, and uses them as the basis of a typology of adjustive response which ought also to hold good for areas other than Oceania (incl.

Abstract : This paper focusses on theoretical questions as well as on case studies taken from the con- temporary cultural panorama in Africa south of the Sahara. It illustrates those "mechanisms" at work which cause some traditions to change as a whole, others in part, and still others very little up to a cer- tain point in history, at which an abrupt, even unexpected, change follows. It also attempts to examine why some traits in music change rapidly under certain conditions, while others preserve a remarkable stability over long periods of time (incl.

Abstract : The literature of ethnomusicology in the last fifteen years has been importantly concerned with change as a significant factor in the comprehension of the musical world. Conventional history has played a part in this literature, but the most prevalent area of interest has been the study of change in the interaction of cultures and segments of cultures, and in particular, in the confrontation between Western and other societies as reflected in musical sound, behavior, and ideas. The interface and pos- sible contrast between the (supposedly) objective view of an outside observer and the perception of the culture's insider has had a major role in recent developments in musical ethnography and analysis, but largely in synchronic studies. The "emic-etic" contrast has not, however, been a principal issue in the study of change. This article seeks to contribute to the understanding of the two sides of the ethno- musicological coin, attempting to summarize what is known (or suspected) about the nature of music history and change in Blackfoot Indian culture, and comparing this with what appears, on the basis of an admittedly small amount of evidence, to be the Blackfoot culture's own perception of music history and the patterns of musical change. It is based substantially on field work carried out on the Blackfoot Indian Reservation in Montana, 1965 to 1985, also on the large quantity of ethnographic work by George Bird Grinnell, Walter McClintock, James Willard Schultz, and above all, Clark Wissler, in the period between 1895 and 1910; and the considerable amount of recorded music and accompanying documentation from the same period and all ensuing decades. We proceed in four sections: origins, sources, history, and change (incl.

At the occasion of the International Youth Year in 1985, the Institute has edited, with special support of UNESCO through the International Music Council, "Music of the Globe," a series of music cassettes with samples of 16 different music traditions, accompanied by illustrated brochures. • Anon.: "Illème Tribune de Musique de l'Amerique Latine et des Caraïbes (TRIM ALCA)," 120-21. • Calendrier/Calendar 1986, 122-25. • IMC/CIM/IMR, 127-30.</page><page sequence="182">200 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) the world of music 27, 1 985 (3) / die welt der musik / le monde de la musique.

Articles • J.H. Kwabena Nketia: "Integrating Objectivity and Experience in Ethnomusicological Studies," 3-22. Abstract : There is a need for a holistic approach to the study of music that takes into account not only the traditional preoccupation of comparative musicologists - scales, modes, tuning systems and their measurements, melodic and rhythmic analysis, polyphony and organology, but also the systematic study of the processes involved in music making. These processes are of two types: musical or artis- tic processes that generate and shape musical events and the socio-cultural processes involved in or generated by music making. The experiential and behavioral aspects of music have, therefore, come to be given as much attention as the formal aspects, for it is now recognized that music is an aspect of culture or a people's way of life, and therefore "enters into specific relationships" with other aspects of culture. Hence what was described rather vaguely as "the anthropological or ethnological branch of musical science" merely because it was to deal with non-Western or so-called extra- European materi- als or the music of societies then studied by anthropologists has developed as an approach to the study of any music, leading to the understanding that the frame of reference of the ethnomusicologist is not just music as an aural or psycho-physical phenomenon, but also music as a socio-cultural phenomenon (incl.

Abstract : Those of us who study the musical traditions of Indonesia cannot help but be aware of the rapid growth of the cassette recording industry throughout much of the country over the last fifteen years. Much of what is available can be classified as "popular" music: pop Barat (Western pop) and pop Indonesia (Indonesian pop). Yet it is rare in a cassette store not to find a substantial section devoted to traditional musical and dramatic forms of the local population. For the most part, these recordings do not represent efforts at preservation or documentation, but rather efforts at turning profits. The ex- tensive offerings of traditional recordings indicate clearly the continued popularity of traditional genres and, I would argue, help these genres find legitimacy in contemporary Indonesia (incl. Kurzfassung/ Résumé). • Lois Ibsen Al Faruqi: "The Suite in Islamic History and Culture," 46-66. Abstract : This paper falls into two major sections. The first of these provides a summary of the materi- als available which pertain to the historical development in Islamic culture of the suite or compound musical form. It deals with materials drawn from literary and theoretical sources written between the 10th and 15th centuries. These writings provide what information we have about the development of that form and give evidence of a very early interest in it by the Muslim peoples from Moorish Spain all the way to Central Asia and the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The second part of the essay considers the place of the suite in Islamic culture in order to account for its relevance over such a vast geographic expanse and for so many centuries of time. For this purpose, correspondences between the visual arabesque and the musical suite will be explored. Although the paper will concentrate on what we can learn about the suite of musical theory and practice during an earlier period, the ideas discussed in the second part of this paper, and substantiated by the historical materials of the first part, have a wide geographic and time significance.

The suite has been known by different names (waslah, fasi, nubah, sanah, etc.) at different times and in different regions; it has had different component parts, instrumentation, and performance styles. Nevertheless, many of the basic characteristics have remained constant. It is those which shall be emphasized in the following presentation (incl.

Abstract : The musical heritage that awaited the Arabs on their arrival in 711 therefore included the Byzantine and the Jewish rites and Romanized Celt-Iberian influences based on the sensibility of the ancient East - in other words, oriental, Greek and native secular and religious traditions. There has been much conjecture over the underlying modal and occasionally pre-modal patterns found in flamen- co. Taken to a logical conclusion the boldest and most attractive of the theories hints at a codification of music in the days of Tartessos. More modestly, the Dorian mode, so frequent in the Mediterranean and coinciding with the hijãz, one of the Arab melodic structures called maqãmãt , may conceivably have originated in Andalusia before being systematized by the Greeks. The resemblance, or reminis- cences, noticed between flamenco and Indian music on the other hand, argue romantically in favor of direct transmission through the gypsies. But as there are 72 scales in Indian music, the fact that one of them happens to be based on the Dorian mode may of course be another coincidence. In any event, the rudiments of the Persian, Indian, and Chinese musical schools were all taught at Córdoba under the Umayyad dynasties (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé).

Provine: "Korean Music in Historical Perspective," 3-15. Abstract : While there are plenty of historical materials available, the range of musical subject matter they cover is rather limited. If one surveys the living genres of traditional Korean music and attempts to investigate their individual histories, only a very few genres prove to be susceptible to productive his- torical investigation. There is, for example, an abundance of sources for court music, but virtually noth- ing for Buddhist music. Few studies of Korean music history based on Korean sources have appeared in western languages. As a result, western scholars attempting to place Korean music in a regional perspective have been compelled to make deductions based on apparent musical flow among the better- studied cultures of mainland Asia and Japan, their data coming from non-Korean (especially Chinese and Japanese) sources. This approach, it turns out, produces a number of unfortunate conclusions such as the misguided view that most Korean music is an imitation of that of its neighbors; in fact, very little of it is. In the present essay, I will examine briefly the nature of musical sources for each major period of Korean history, noting their strengths and weaknesses (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Hahn Man-young: "The Origin of Korean Music," 16-31. Abstract : Music is very closely correlated to both language and religion. To this effect, a saying of King Kasil (early 6th century A.D.) of the Kaya kingdom is very meaningful: "Every country has its own language and dialects, so how can one expect music to be the same everywhere?" Up to now, such reli- gions as shamanism, Buddhism and Confucianism have dominated the spiritual and social life patterns of the Koreans, together with Christianity in the 20th century. Of these religions, shamanism has the oldest roots in the Korean mentality. Therefore, this paper will deal with historical research on Korean musical traits associated with shaman rituals (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Hwang Byung-ki: "Some Notes on Korean Music and Aspects of its Aesthetics," 32^18.

Aak was primarily employed by the king both for ceremonial purposes, in which case it was called cheryeak, and for performances at royal banquets and other similar functions, in which case it was called yonryeak. It was also used in royal processions and in military-type functions, in which case it was called kunryeak (incl.

Abstract : Korea's material and spiritual culture has been deeply rooted in Buddhism, since its introduc- tion in the late 4th century A. D. The major role of Buddhism as that of an educational and protective medium throughout the historical kingdoms and dynasties of Korea, and the religion was mainly sup- ported by aristocrats in the early stage of its propagation. However, through the gradual assimilation of the indigenous shamanistic cult, even the most matter-of-fact man in Korea who professed no religion at all now became Buddhist, even if only unconsciously. The Buddhist attitude to life and its sense of values unconsciously permeated deeply in the average Koreans' mind. Mahayana, the principal sect of Korean Buddhism, became integrated into people's everyday life, and the practice of the Buddhist per- forming ritual arts was thoroughly institutionalized. The ritual performing arts have played a vital role in intensifying the religious experience in the various Buddhist rites. Mystic expressions through aural and visual media had indeed been one of the characteristics commonly found in the countries whose belief system was based on the Mahayana Buddhism (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Song Bang-song: "Present State of Research on Korean Traditional Music," 63-77. Abstract : The study of Korean traditional music has been carried on by Korean musicologists from two standpoints: from a diachronic point of view, i.e. as historico-musicological research, and from a synchronic standpoint, i.e. as an ethnomusicological study. The domain of Korean musicology there- fore is usually divided into two main fields: historico-musicology and ethnomusicology. The first field deals with the study of Korean music history, while the second field comprises the study of folk music and music culture in contemporary Korean society. Our survey must then be confined to what Korean musicologists have accomplished both in the fields of Korean historico-musicology and ethnomusicol- ogy (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë).

Thrasher: "The Role of Music in Chinese Culture," 3-18. Abstract : Chinese music is not a single unified tradition. Even the casual observer is struck by the ap- parent contradictions in aesthetic between the qin zither repertoire and that of the suona oboe (as heard in the Peking opera), or between the chamber music traditions and the outdoor processionals. These musics, in fact, belong to different social strata and address the needs of diverse functions. In spite of the neutralizing effects of the Confucian institution, these traditions have tie in common. Therefore, in determining the role of music in Chinese life, we must accommodate these various traditions by first considering the key factors of social stratification, function, and regional preference (incl. Kurzfas- sung/Résumé). • Marjory Bong-Ray Liu: "Aesthetic Principles in Chinese Music," 19-32. Abstract. Chinese music is generally described in terms of its individual musical characteristics per- taining to the elements of pitch, time, and timbre, or to their organization as melody, rhythm and tex- ture. Stylistic qualities are also mentioned, such as fluidity of heterophonic progression and clarity of separate parts within a sparsely interwoven musical texture. Yet there is little reference to fundamental principles, or operative rules, that provide an adequate schema for interpreting such characteristics aesthetically The purpose of this work, therefore, is to suggest a paradigm for studying Chinese music on the basis of aesthetic principles, in order to link theory and practice by indicating the way in which the aesthetic process is translated into the aesthetic product. The problem, however, is ultimately that of ascertaining just how aesthetic values are expressed in Chinese music, and of determining in turn how much they influence Chinese musical style (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumě). • Kenneth J. DeWoskin: "Philosophers on Music in Early China," 33^17. Abstract : During the two eras, the Zhou dynasty classical age of philosophy and the first period of imperial unity under the Han, the core of China's philosophy traditions was developed and refined. Later, under the influence of Buddhist thought, these traditions were challenged and transformed. Dur- ing the medieval age (Six Dynasties) and the great middle dynasties, the Tang and Song, influence of Buddhism grew, bringing about a greater diversity of thought and practice. Especially during the Tang, new instruments were imported at a great pace; foreign orchestras and music were prized. During the Song, new lyric forms emerged blending foreign and native influences. Song thought represented a mature amalgam of foreign and native philosophical traditions. Music again came to the forefront of philosophical debate, related to problems of self-cultivation, inner experience, and the accommodation of self to society. From a vigorous stream of empirical thinking during the Song came sustained studies of the acoustical properties of sound, the mathematics of the 1 2 pitches (shi 'erlii), the true measure- ments and properties of archaic bells and chimes, and the technologies of bell casting and tuning, stone carving and idiophones suspension (incl.

Abstract : In a few exceptional cases, certain performers such as Liu Tien-hua (on er-hu ) and Liang Tsai-ping (on zheng ) have been able to develop a given genre beyond its folk and regional identity to achieve a personal, artistic style. The acknowledgement of this highest level of master artist is usually associated with contributions of new techniques and repertory, as well as dissemination activity: teach- ing, performances, publications. These dual aspects of regional characterization and artistic personifi- cation are nowhere more evident in the current state of Chinese music performance than in the music of zheng. Thus the solo style of the sixteen-stringed zheng is an ideal medium to illustrate and further investigate the perspectives on notation and performance conventions. Not only does zheng- music rep- resent a major repertory and widespread practice, but crucial to this inquiry, is the existence of a variety of notations with corresponding performance examples. The performance examples by different zheng masters, which I transcribed into Western staff notation for analysis purpose, provide a contrast of dif- ferent regional styles and comparison with various notational sources (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Han Kuo-huang: "Titles and Program Notes in Chinese Musical Repertoires," 68-77. Abstract : Many Chinese musicians and writers simply like to interpret musical compositions from a literary point of view. From ancient qin compositions to modern revolutionary piano works, from poetic titles to socialist names, from the habit of describing the meaning of a piece to the insistence of interpreting its class nature, it is clear that the Chinese attitude toward program music is a traditional one which has come a long way. While the desire to know the meaning of a given piece and the practice of writing program notes are not exclusively Chinese, the emphasis on the former and the love of the literary connotation of the latter are certainly unique to Chinese culture. The love of titles, generally poetic or at least meaningful in the literary sense, has little parallel (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Trän Van Khê: "Chinese Music and Musical Traditions of Eastern Asia," 78-90. Abstract : Throughout history, Chinese music influenced the music of other Far Eastern countries or received from the latter certain elements of their musical language. The migration of musical instru- ments, the same source of musical theory, the relationship between musical languages and the close relationship between the art music of China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia and Vietnam throughout history justify the union of these countries in a large musical family. While maintaining their own personali- ties in both the field of popular music linked to daily events and gestures and in that of music with an art tradition which has been indexed and codified, these countries have similarities which confirm the extensive inter-influence between the musical tradition of China and that of Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Mongolia (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé ). • Yang Ling: "Music and Dance Performance with China's Oldest Musical Instruments - A Report from the People's Republic of China," 91-95. Abstract : In September and October 1983, a performance of ancient music and dance based on the Chu culture was staged in Beijing by the Hubei Provincial Song and Dance Ensemble. It attracted much attention in the capital's art circles as it marked a new stage in carrying on the tradition of an- cient Chinese music and dance. This music is performed on a set of bronze chime bells, a set of stone and jade percussion plaques, drums, flutes, pan-pipes and several kinds of zithers, with chime bells as the principal musical instrument. This is the largest orchestra specializing in ancient music in China. It consists of over 40 members and more than one hundred instruments, including the tao xun, an egg- shaped earthen flute used some 6,000 years ago and a pair of tao xiang qiu, spheric earthen flutes of the Neolithic Age discovered at Jingshan County in central China's Hubei province. The ancient orchestra was recreated in imitation of the musical instruments unearthed in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng, a minor state within Chu's sphere of influence. These instruments are arranged according to their different functions, featuring the set of bronze chime bells and the set of stone and jade percussion plaques (incl.

Articles • Marius Schneider: "The Birth of the Symbol in Music," 3-21. Abstract : The study of the mythology of ancient civilizations shows that the symbol and the creative process are closely connected. The Brahman tradition, for example, speaks of a primordial sound (the brähman), which is the first sacrifice and is interpreted as the first creating act. This primordial sound sacrifice, which is located in the element akasha and is inaudible, reveals itself only after the birth of the element air. Thus the first cosmic symbol arises with the sacrifice of the first breath of life. In our world the element air is the first reality in which the creating rhythm can reveal itself by pronouncing itself. This brahman passing through the air to transmit to it the first perceptible rhythm is "the best possible formulation," the transcendent, inaudible rhythm appears through the air (becomes audible) in order to create the primordial world. The Kena Upanishad says: "Although the brahman is found beyond time it is, nevertheless, the place of origin of all the beings in the world." (incl.

Contents and Abstracts • 207 with sacred texts in Sanskrit, translated or transliterated into Chinese and pronounced differently by the populations of the countries of Eastern Asia; Hinayana (little vehicle) or Theravada with sacred texts in "Pali" not translated, a school which spread to Sri Lanka, Thailand, Kampuchea, Laos and Burma; Lamaism in Tibet with liturgical music and a vocal technique of recitation which were highly organized. In this article we shall try to cover the different styles of Buddhist music in the countries of Eastern Asia, the Mahayana countries, define common characteristics and underline the main musi- cal differences. The term "Buddhist music" does not here mean music inspired or influenced by the Buddhist religion. It indicates an essentially vocal, ritual and liturgical music accompanied only by rhythmical religious instruments and rarely by instruments used for secular music, recitation of sacred texts or chants of praise heard in Buddhist temples and homes or during Buddhist ceremonies (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Lawrence E. Sullivan: "Sacred Music and Sacred Time," 33-52. Abstract In this article we shall consider the relationship of sacred music to several kinds of time: cosmogonie, cosmological, cultural, and eschatological. In light of the following comments about the connective and transmissive nature of sacred music, these categories cannot be absolute or exclusive. The nature of symbols precludes their exhaustive analysis into rigidly separated categories, for they fulfill the function of linking levels of existence and meaning to one another through their economic multivalence. For example, songs associated with time lines characteristic of human culture (e.g., ini- tiation) refer also to the age when Culture Heroes founded initiation rites. Feasts associated with the seasonal periods of the dry season often make symbolic allusion to that "eternal dry season" during the primordium when the sun shone in an unbroken daytime. That epoch may have ended in conflagration. A dream-song may transport one's soul into another time (that of the primordial period or of post- mortem existence) but may also play a central role in initiation or in healing. As a further example of the links made between different time lines, we may cite the case of the Waiwai (Venezuela) song of the moon now associated with the cosmologie lunar-monthly cycles. However, it originally "belonged" to that mythic era when the moon copulated with his sister. In this article we will choose examples from the cultures of native South America to illustrate the relationship of sacred music to the experience of time (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Andreas Gutzwiller: "The Shakuhachi of the Fuke-Sect: Instrument of Zen," 53-65. Abstract : Of all the Japanese musical instruments still played today the shakuhachi-ft ute has perhaps the strangest history of all, making it into something of an outsider in this regard. Introduced into Japan from China in the 7th century, soon forgotten, perhaps arriving once again in the 1 3th century, the shakuhachi for long had a special place and only in the 19th century came to associate with other instruments. But the shakuhachi is not only an outsider in historical terms: it is also an instrument of outsiders, and even its music, which has developed over long periods in social isolation, has taken on curious, eccentric features: an eccentric among instruments and an instrument of eccentrics. How far back the link between the shakuhachi and Buddhism goes is unclear, as is the exact nature of this link. There is little information as to whether such a connection already existed in China, before the instru- ment was brought to Japan (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé).

Kwabena Nketia: "Universal Perspectives in Ethnomusicology," 3-24. Abstract : Since the concept of a cultural universal allows for the universe of any aspect of culture to be defined in terms of what is intrinsic to it in human cultures, it can be usefully applied to the cross- cultural study of music, for as a mode of expression, music is found in every known culture. While some of its features are culture specific, others have a distribution across cultures. The study of indi- vidual musical traditions can, therefore, be approached from within in terms of their specific artistic and socio-cultural usages and norms as well as from a wider universal perspective in respect of what they share or do not share with other traditions. On the general level any aspect of music as "language," an object of aesthetic interest, or music as culture can also be examined cross-culturally in respect of recurring features as well as the nature and type of variants and invariants, and what these tell us about processes of integration and differentiation in music (incl.

Abstract Methodologically, the existence or non-existence of universais is susceptible to empirical research, followed by confirmation or rejection. When scholar A maintains that phenomenon x occurs throughout the whole of a given field y, his/her findings can be confirmed or disproved by scholars B, C and C acting independently. The phenomenon in question is either universal or it is not. Since all normal human beings are known to communicate by means of speech, speech is a universal within the field of human communication. New Guinea Highlanders communicate across mountain valleys by "yodeling;" the habitants of North Wales do not. Therefore, "yodeling" is not a universal within either the same field or within the restricted field of communication by human inhabitants of a mountainous terrain. At a different level, within the field of speech self (i. e., a part of the field of human communica- tion), the universality or non-universality of a particular phoneme can be established by empirical re- search, granted the possibility of defining a "phoneme" in the first place (incl. Kurzfassung/Rèsumë). • George List: "Concerning the Concept of the Universal and Music," 40-49. Abstract : In most discussions of universais in music two problems, both of definition seem to be ig- nored. Before discussing universais do we not need to define the term "music?" Some societies have no specific term for music. They may, for example, have a term for song but no separate term for melody. There is often less differentiation of the elements of an event.

Therefore in many cases our definition of music must be that of the outsider, of the scholar, not of the members of the culture themselves. Definition are difficult even for the outsider. We think of the melody of song as music but speech also has melody. Both song and speech display pitch patterns. In fact song and speech are merely end points on a continuum and at times it is difficult to establish their boundaries. And what about instrumental music? Does the African talking drum speak or make music? In the same region of Colombia the musical bow may be used to play melodies with discrete pitches or to imitate by glides and other effects the sounds of animals. Is or is not the latter music?

Abstract : About 28,000 years before the present, the first known musical instrument of hominid manu- facture was deposited in a cave in France. For the next 18,000 years, humans developed musical in- struments from whatever organic materials were available in their respective ecological niches and according to their respective technologies; during this time they developed unique systems of musical expression as different from each other as their spoken languages and world views were different. Wherever contact was possible, sovereign cultures have exchanged aspects of their musical traditions in varying degree, but they have done so sufficiently to create the illusion of commonality that has inspired a quest to find the Grail of musical universais. With the advent of global communication and phonographic technology, we supposedly had the means for pursuing this quest. After the past hundred years of comparative studies, an ineluctable truth is manifest: there are no absolute universais of music. There may be some universal neurological responses to musical stimuli, but this possibility remains largely hypothetical and untested among all the world's cultures. At the present, the only universal seems to be that all peoples have some type of musical behavior (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Ellen Koskoff: "Thoughts on Universals in Music," 66-87. Abstract. In a rebuttal to ideas presented at a Society for Ethnomusicology panel discussion in 1970, George List, in proposing a "Non-Universality of Music Perspectives," finally laments: "We have probably been talking and writing to ourselves." Intrigued by his statement, and putting aside, for the moment, the frustration couched within it, I set out for this article to test List's somewhat off-handed hypothesis. Could we possibly learn something about universais in music if we stopped, briefly, talk- ing to ourselves and talked, instead, with others? For the purpose of this investigation, I interviewed a group of world renowned performers of western music, all of whom teach at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY. I hoped simply to find out what their ideas were concerning universais in mu- sic, and to what degree they might share their ideas with each other or with ethnomusicologists. Could a different approach to universais be developed that would allow major differences as well as similari- ties to be examined, perhaps within the context of individual cognitive systems? First, precisely what do ethnomusicologists say when talking to themselves about universais? (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Judith Lynne Hanna: "Towards Discovering the Universais of Dance," 88-103. Abstract : On the basis of a worldwide survey of behavior generally called dance, the universais appear to be the common attributes or underlying principles of culturally diverse phenomena. Dance has 1 ) purpose, from the dancer's perspective which is usually shared by the audience members of the danc- er's culture, 2) intentional rhythm, 3) culturally patterned sequences, 4) use of extraordinary nonverbal movement with inherent and aesthetic value, 5) manifestation through the body instrument in time, space, and with effort, 6) an interactive dynamic process, and 7) transformational potential. As scholars learn more about the dance cultures of the world, this empirical generalization of apparently shared features may need revision. A brief discussion toward taxonomy for comparative dance research fol- lows. All methods involve comparison, although it is not always explicit. Comparative research helps to enlighten a specific case, explain behavior within and between cultures, and extend generalizations (incl.

Kwabena Nketia: "The Aesthetic Dimension in Ethnomusicological Studies," 3-28. Abstract : The need for ethnomusicological approaches to the study of the aesthetic dimension of mu- sic has long been recognized, for aesthetic principles, ideas, values and behavior are developed in the context of society and culture and are related not only to the types of music that each society or social group cultivates, but also to its value system, concept of reality, and the fundamental needs or goals it seeks to fulfill through music. Hence the principle now widely accepted in ethnomusicology that each music must be studied in terms of itself and in the context of its society and culture applies as much to the study of style as to the aesthetic dimension of music. This relativist position does not of course imply that aesthetic principles are everywhere totally exclusive, for to assume this would be to deny the basic human factors that make limited intercultural musical experiences possible. The capacity to perceive, feel and respond emotionally, spiritually and intellectually to music is by no means confined to those societies that verbalize the aesthetic dimension of their music or make it a subject of philo- sophical enquiry. It is widely shared, and thus makes it possible, when cultivated, for the non-members of a musical tradition to gain some access to that tradition. Moreover as Mantle Hood suggested almost two decades ago, "the potential for a universal aesthetic" for particular musical pieces in the world of music "exists" or can at least be postulated in the light of intercultural musical experiences in our con- temporary world (1965).

Abstract : The love of Western art music drove the early ethnomusicologists into an attitude of exoti- cism. Many of us have marveled at the neglect, until recently, of the world's urban popular musics by ethnomusicologists.

For reason, at least in part, those kinds of non- Western music that exhibited real or imagined relationships to Western music were neglected. I include here the now well-known acculturated phenomena, or musics which by chance approximate Western- like sounds. The early scholars, and many later ones, tried to draw sharp lines between the ours-not- ours categories. And so, for many decades, a vast proportion of the extant music in the third world 20th century was ignored. As we know, only recently have various popular and urban musical phenomena received attention (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Yang Ling: "China Recovers Her Past in Folk Song - A Report," 44-50. Abstract As in most countries, Chinese folk songs range over a wide array of topics - work, love, legends, the habits of birds and animals, the beauty of landscape, social customs, and ritual. The Musi- cians' Association estimates that as many as 120,000 folk songs remain to be collected. Eventually, the Association expects to publish a comprehensive 30-volume collection of songs, including works repre- senting all of China's provinces, cities, and autonomous regions (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Simha Arom: "The Constituting Features of Central African Rhythmic Systems: A Tentative Typology," 51-67. Abstract : When one speaks of African music, one often refers to the "infinite variety" of its rhythmic and its "improvisational" aspect. But, a deep examination of the musical practice of a traditional soci- ety reveals that the rhythmic system, far from being infinite, is, quite to the contrary, perfectly finite. It constitutes, in act, a closed corpus of polyrhythmic formulas - that is, the combination of several superimposed rhythmic figures - adapted to diverse social circumstances. These formulae are distinc- tive in that they are in opposition, the ones to the others, through their function, their denomination and the musical material which is operating in them. Such corpora, which are very limited, possess barely a dozen formulae. The Aka pygmies, for example, whose music is proverbially rich, have at their dis- posal a total of no more than seven polyrhythmic combinations (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé ). • Manuel Danneman: "Autochthonous Musical Culture in Chile," 68-77. Abstract : At present, we witness the increasing popularity of commercial, mass-oriented music for which two main reasons can be seen: the gradual loss of cultural identity among the members of au- tochthonous groups, either due to feelings of shame at being what they are or a gradual psycho-cultural transition towards a modern hybridization of a usually urban nature; or simply the belief from their part, from having so often heard and experienced it, that the day of the Indian is over. In addition, there is also the relentless advance of non-Catholic Christian religions throughout the entire country, whose emissaries and promoters - far more intolerantly and severely than the Spanish missionaries of four hundred years ago - forbid the practice of pre-Hispanic indigenous musical traditions, as well as His- panic Chilean hybridizations of Catholic origin (incl.

Abstract : What can be legitimately claimed is that the attitude of aestheticism or "art for art's sake" is appropriate to some socio-economic conditions and not others. But aesthetics as such does not in- volve commitment to any such attitude. What is true is that aesthetics concerns itself with behavior that requires leisure. But leisure in the required sense is not a life of idleness. It is not even a life with a lot of free time. It is no more than freely disposable energy that can be given to the production and appreciation of contemplatable aspects of phenomena, and almost all lives have enough such energy for aesthetics to be of universal applicability. In fact, the objection that aesthetics as such is devoted to the specific concerns of privileged and productively marginal minorities seems to be a mere mask for the wish to harness all such spare energy for ideological purposes, and belongs to the lunatic fringe of revolutionary rhetoric. There are, of course, aesthetic theories, such as that of T. W. Adorno, which would restrict the proper concern of aesthetics to something that is possible to a leisured class, but they are specific theories and by no means representative of a necessary tendency within aesthetics as a whole (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Ivan Supičič: "Aethetics of Music - Particularity and Universality," 16-25. Abstract: The new orientation of contemporary aesthetics of music consist, among other aspects, in the fact that its inspiration is for the most part artistic and that it is interested in the object of art as such. This orientation is basically correct; although it need not, must not even, rule out the complementary interest in the objects of art from philosophical, sociological and cultural perspectives. Precisely, the subject of the aesthetics of music is the exploration of musical works as a result of a determined world of thought and feeling, and of a certain mentality and concept in given intellectual, emotional and spiritual contexts as is determined in historical and cultural conditions. The abandonment of normative claims has been an important step in the process of "demythologization" of contemporary aesthetics of music and in the attempt of finds its own scientific rationale (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Doris Stockmann: "Universals in Aesthetic Valuation of Music?, "2 6^15. Abstract : Do we really know what "aesthetic" means in different contexts? There are some open ques- tions, I think, for instance concerning the borderlines between aesthetics and non-aesthetical behav- ior, not only in respect to music. What do we know about it? And how could we distinguish between different aesthetical "feelings" or "sensations" related to the same object, e.g. a special song heard in different situations? Or what about the possible differences in history? What does aesthetic mean in this or that period, culture, or particular context?

One should suppose, I think that these kinds of communicative in- teraction within groups generate other types of aesthetical experience, than e. g. auto-communication, or the different kinds of non-ceremonial performance which actualize artifacts, produced intentionally and shaped consciously, for attracting a passive audience and helping listeners to come across sensual enjoyment, and self-enjoyment. Concerning aesthetic valuation (which comprises of positive as well as negative components) we are used to thinking mainly of formal qualities (value or Gestalt), and less of functional qualities (value of function, duty, utilization). But even the word function (akin to Sanskrit bhiikte = 'he enjoys') tells us, that aesthetical aspects are involved also on this level (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumê). • Nils L. Wallin: "Pitch Perception as Expression for Exogene and Endogene Coordinated Oscillations," 46-64. Abstract : This paper deals with music mainly on an infrastructural level. The study is part of an ongo- ing attempt to look at music, musical creativity and music perception from a biological point of view; that means from a realm in which both phylogeny and ontogeny of man have their roots. By means of paradigms and models belonging to neuroscience and to the current theories of in-deterministic, evolv- ing systems, of emergent importance not only for the sciences but also for the humanities, it might be possible to establish and describe functional relationships between musical micro- and macro-levels. In the latter we find the questions and problems regarding aesthetics and aesthetic values in music. Both the idea of a musical morphogenesis and the statement that music can be regarded as a coordi- nator of exogenic and endogenic human forces (what has its prescientific and scientific equivalents and prototypes in several old cultures) are touching this hierarchical relation between micro-level and macro-level. They mirror as well the common view in today's science that functions and structures are complementary by determining each other - which makes a morphogenesis as suggested possible, because functions here also means environment. From aspects like these I thus believe that the problem dealt with in this paper on a general but basic level has a far reaching significance for discussions on music aesthetics (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumě). • Judith Becker: "'Aesthetics' in Late 20th Century Scholarship," 65-80. Abstract It may be possible to salvage the term "aesthetic" as a cross-cultural phenomenon if we take one of three possible alternative approaches. One, we can broaden the term to subsume the related concepts of value and meaning while simultaneously establishing a frame within which to compare aesthetics cross-culturally. Secondly, we can broaden the term to subsume related concepts such as value and meaning and resist the temptation to make cross-cultural comparisons, focusing rather on detailed "thick" (Geertz, 1973) particularistic descriptions. Thirdly, we can work toward discover- ing what may be the universal, psychological responses of satisfaction or joy felt by perceivers upon hearing or producing musical events. These three approaches, which can be applied to any scholarly endeavor, have often been pitted against each other, their partisans enlivening scholarly debate and professional meetings; the first, a type of structural approach, the second a more literary, rhetorical approach, and the third a universalist, psychological approach. If we can grant the validity, the inter- dependence and intertwined relationship of all three, I would like to explore here one way to reclaim the term aesthetics within the first approach and suggest another way within the third, universalistic approach. The methodology outlined in this article was originally developed in relation to the second, the richly descriptive graphy essays based on thorough knowledge of the language involved and a long period of fieldwork. This kind of data can then be looked at cross-culturally for comparative studies (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). Book and Recording Reviews, 81-92 (also in German and French).

Abstract : This paper is an attempt to present new evidence for the possibility of interchange of musi- cal elements between the Islamic and Christian worlds. It is an attempt to establish the relationship between the Arabic Andalusian nawba tradition of Medieval Spain and the secular music of Christian Europe at that time in one of the very important aspects of music, the musical form. No, I have not found Arabic medieval manuscripts. I have decided to proceed a different way. It has been pointed out by Mantle Hood that the study of contemporary musical traditions can provide the insight into the traditions of the past. Here I will test the feasibility of this thesis by comparing the forms of one of the musical genres of Morocco, that of the nawba tradition with the secular, particularly that of the troubadours and the trouvères, notated in numerous manuscripts in medieval Christian Europe (incl.

Abstract : There was no systematic collecting of folk songs until the end of the 18th century, and there was also no contact between folk and art music. Two things have to be taken into consideration here. First, that musical creativity as developing in the Croatian and in the Slovenian areas, either was the output of composers of Slovenian or Croatian origin, or it was, in its spirit and style, oriented towards the West-European musical sphere and had at no time any contact with folk music, which was widely spread and which played an important role in the life of simple folk. It also has to be pointed out that the Serbian and the Macedonian areas, in which folk music was flourishing in its variety, were, because of the Turkish occupation, cut off from Western culture. In these two areas no traces of art music dur- ing the period in question can be found. Regarding art music, the Eastern (Serbian and Macedonian) and the Western (Croatian and Serbian) areas were two mutually different worlds. What they had in common, however, in the overall musical sense was the fact that folk music lived in both of them - but conditioned by the specific features of the geographic and ethnic region and therefore in mutual com- parison, different (incl.

But it is evident that they pro- vide a bridge between the two cultures: and in so doing they support the idea that in the same way that one speaks of Indo-European languages or of Mediterranean musics, there clearly exists a circumpolar musical civilization (incl.

Abstract : A question interesting from the point of view of cognitive psychology is whether the syn- tactic structures of rãgas are conscious or unconscious with the musicians. According to the so-called symbolist school, mental functions are based on language, while their opponents, the conceptualists, would base thinking on abstract structures, one manifestation of which is language. If a cognitive structure is conscious, it may be argued that language is its "carrier," that is, support the symbolist position. Apparently to evade this counter argument, some conceptualists have gone so far as to pro- pose that cognitive structures are unconscious, in which case they cannot be verbalized. According to Lévi-Strauss (1958), the study of cognitive systems proceeds from conscious contents (here rãgas to their unconscious structures, while Piaget ( 1 97 1 ) stresses that "cognitive structures do not belong to the subject's consciousness but to his operational behavior " I have presented the above syntactic structures and their transformation laws to one of Maitra's foremost disciples, Buddhadev Das Gupta, and his comments seem to support the conceptualist claim (incl.

On the 21st day of the 6th month of the year 756 A. D. this large storehouse was dedicated by the Empress Dowager Komyo in honor of the 49the day (the 7 times 7th day) of the death of the Emperor Shomu. Into the Shosoin were placed most of the household materials of the imperial home along with a catalogue. The storehouse was on the grounds of the Todaiji temple in Nara which occasionally used materials from the Shosoin as well as placed some of its own possessions into storage. The largest additions to the collection were made in 950 A. D. By some miracle the Shosoin was relatively untouched by the next thousand years of historical strife and destruction. In 1 833 its contents were removed in order to repair the building and among them were found some 55 musical instruments plus 171 masks and various dance accessories. In 1872 a systematic study of this unique collection was begun (incl. Kurzfassung/ Résumé ). • Eta Harich-Schneider: "Dances and Songs of the Japanese Shinto Cult," 16-29. Abstract : Ainu lore, language and customs are now eagerly studied by Japanese and Western ethnolo- gists. Ainu religious concepts are autochthonal. They have no relation to Japanese Shinto but rather point to Korean and north Asian origin. Shinto, on the other hand, shares many legends and custom with the inhabitants of the Southeast Asian archipelago. As for China, the Imperial annals take rather late notice of the Japanese islands and their inhabitants, the Wa. The Wei Chih (c. 298 A. D.) and the Hou Han Shu (c. 443 A. D.) mention the obituary customs of the Wa and their love of dance, song and pantomime. According to Japanese mythology, shinto music stems from the time of the gods when there was no earth and sea. In the Kojiki (Report of Ancient Matters), the reader is confronted by a rath- er clumsy young couple of undefined essence, Isanagi and Isanami. They take their orders from some- thing above them, invisible and equally undefined, an oracle.

It is not astonishing that the aesthetics of the jo-ha-kyü should be more marked in the the- atre of the noh than in the musical genres imported from China, such as the gagaku. In the light of the phenomena of Zen and Shintoism, the precise characteristics of the music of the noh appear to be due partially to the relationships which this aesthetic forms of Zen: the double musical and spiritual func- tion of the kakegoe cries and the posteriorization of the vowels which corresponds with the search for a feeling of internal peacefulness; and, on the other hand, the relationship with Shintoism and autochtho- nous thought; the principle of jo-ha-kyü governing a kind of temporal architecture inspired by a feeling of becoming (naru) which in a way constitutes the fundamental concept of time for the Japanese. The very convergence of these spiritual elements reinforces the hypotheses of a confluence of the aesthetic and spiritual aims in the noh (incl.

Abstract : It may be said that the noh, which is on the one hand a synthesis of all the arts of drama, music, singing, and dancing which were its historical antecedents, is also, in terms of its libretti, an eminently literary art. Some of these libretti (yõkyoku), especially those written by Zeami, can, quite independently of their dramatic quality, be counted among the masterpieces of Japanese poetry. Long neglected by noh enthusiasts, who were only interested in interpreting them, they have in recent years been printed in carefully prepared editions (incl.

Abstract : Today a musician of a traditional instrument, such as the koto, shamisen, shakuhachi, or the court orchestra (gagaku), may perform a newly-composed contemporary piece dressed in western clothing. However, a performance of a classical piece in casual dress will, in all likelihood, offend the traditional audience. In conclusion, we may say that in traditional Japanese society and even today, the concept of "performance" bears after all a strong tendency towards ceremonialism. Therefore, puri- fication, the observance of proprieties, proper order, and proper raiment have special significance. A traditional music performance clearly conveys then not only musical elements, but also social values and mores as well (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Joyce R. Malm: "The World of Japanese Classical Dance," 70-79. Abstract "What is Japanese dance like?" This question, which one sometimes hears, implies that there is only one kind of Japanese dance. It is not true. There are folk and classical art dance forms. And in the case of the latter, styles differ during different historical periods and even within the same time period, just as in the West. Is there a distinct difference between Japanese classical and folk dance? 2. Which forms comprise the world of Japanese classical dance in contemporary times? 3. How did the classical dance develop over the centuries? 4. How do the dance styles resemble and/or differ from each other? 5. And, for which reasons and in which ways have the classical dances been preserved? To answer these questions and to begin to understand the world of Japanese classical dance, one needs a historical, cultural, philosophical, and aesthetic frame of reference (incl.

Abstract : For Japanese, the idea of "originality" has a somewhat different meaning from that of the Westerners. To start with, Japan introduces something from a foreign country, be it a technique or a style, essentially as an imitation. But once introduced, it soon undergoes a process of transition an adaptation to Japanese taste and ideas. So out of the original imitation something actually Japanese evolves. Of course, this special characteristic also applies to Japanese music (incl. Kurzfassung/ Ré- sumé). Book and Recording Reviews, 91-116 (also in German and French).

Articles • Marius Schneider: "On Gregorian Chant and the Human Voice," 3-22. Abstract : In contrast to the ancient theory of the primacy and union of word and sound, Christian mu- sical doctrine has made a clear distinction between the movement of word and that of sound. When discussing music it gives no importance to the "creative power" of sound, but limits itself to speaking about the moralitas artis musicae, that is, how the song, either practically or aesthetically can augment devotion. This explains how the austere style of the ars psallendi, which has absolutely no aesthetic intent, was almost the only sector of Gregorian chant in whose theory there remained traces of the ideas that the anima naturaliter Christiana had developed from ancient times about the value of the words as they are chanted in psalms. Since psalmody is the oldest form of Gregorian chant, it seems legitimate to deduce that the ideology of the psalms corresponds to what Gregorian chant meant in early times: the sacrifice of individualism the singer makes when he sings in the choir (that is, the sacrifice of his vital breath) in order to open the way for the Holy Spirit, to perform good works, and to live the Christian life (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Wayne Howard: "Music and Accentuation in Vedic Literature," 23-34. Abstract : The Vedas are preserved and conveyed, from teacher to pupil, through the medium of music. Because of the close attention paid in the transmission process to meticulous detail, it appears likely that performances of present-day reciters and chanters echo musical practices prevalent during the Vedic era. Therefore the testimonials of living Vaidikas (Vedic scholars) are of incalculable worth not only to the scholar of ancient Indian music but also to music historians and others seeking to compre- hend the development of monophonie traditions in both East and West. The Vedic oral traditions are the world's oldest and can in theory be traced back, in an unbroken line, to protohistoric India (incl.

Music of everyday life, zafan, is performed by both men and women; it possesses a distinctive musical system and is often improvised. Zafan styles also vary according to the geographical and ethnic heritage of a musician. Ethiopian sacred music, zëmâ , is performed by highly trained male musicians; it possesses a separate modal system, and, with few exceptions, stresses continuity over time rather than innovation. Zëmâ , is associated with the Ethiopian Christian Church, and despite subtle regional differences, is considered to transcend the various ethnic identities incorporated within Church membership (incl. Kurzfassung/ Résumé). • Jean During: "Revelation and Spiritual Audition in Islam," 68-84. Abstract: Tradition has it that God created all beings with one word (kon, Bel). Then He ordered all to return to Him, tracing the predestined path of creatures according to two axes, that of descent (nozuli) and that of rising again (so 'udi). If there is a divine word, it exists in order to be heard, and at the basis of all audition, there is the fact that in order to understand it, the subject should leave aside for a mo- ment his Me so that he can put himself in the place of the one who speaks. In doing this he puts himself at the disposition of the other, becomes the other, submits to his will. Ob-audire, "to listen," becomes in Latin synonymous with submission, obedience , seen from this aspect, this is why the Word, which comes from the "World of the decree" ('ãlam al amr) has the value of law, and is prescriptive; and the response of the subject will be submission (taslim, mosalmãn, he who has submitted). But the divine message also contains a word of wisdom which applies to the perception and which calls for an active meditation which should bring the human spirit in close contact with its divine source (incl. Kurzfas- sung/Résumé). • Ter Ellingson: "Indian Influences in Tibetan Music," 85-93. Abstract : To explore the question of Indian influences in Tibetan music, we have to abandon certain preconceptions of what is and what is not "Indian." Tibetan music does not include the sitars and sa- rangis of Indian classical music; it does include ensembles of trumpets, oboes, cymbals, and drums, as do the Indian court and temple ceremonial music traditions. Tibetan music does not feature the elabo- rate rhythmic improvisations of tabla and mrdarigam; it does feature the rhythmic-structural leadership of cymbals, as did the ensembles of Bharata's Nãtyasãstra, and as do the Kathakali theatre ensembles of today. Tibetan music did not experience the changes brought to Indian music by Muslim courts and culture; it did retain elements of Buddhist musical theory and practice that have all but disappeared from their Indian homeland. Since the two cultures have gone increasingly divergent ways since their closest contact a thousand years ago, the solution to our problem must be a search for roots in the past which will reveal as much about Indian as about Tibetan music (incl.

Abstract : That the traditional musical expressions of Latin America emanate from their tri-ethnic cul- tural origin is a truism of limited usefulness. Along with social scientists who have long recognized the essentially mestizo or creole nature of folk and popular culture of Latin America, ethnomusicologists' attention has begun to focus, in recent years, on the numerous and varying levels of syncretism that ac- count for the existence of certain unique musical features, repertories, instruments, practices, functions and values. While it is appropriate to attempt to ascertain Latin American folk music derivations from Amerindian, European and African sources, the specific place of a given musical culture (defined by whatever recognized criteria) within the continuum of acculturation warrants a more immediate and earnest inquiry in view of a more accurate and faithful understanding of the true nature and complexity of the musical culture in question (incl.

Abstract Summarizing we can state that the indigenous groups of Venezuela which have been stud- ied to date, have different music, with one, two or more different styles. They use a large variety of (non-tempered) scales. The rhythm is free, especially in canticles and recitations, and their songs and instrumental pieces vary infinitely. Apart from individual differences of the groups, it is impossible to detect exclusive features in each group. I would say that there are as many types of music as different languages. All these groups preserve their essential traits, accepting more or less the acculturation, pro- moted by the representatives of various religions, and the "gold searchers" (or money searchers) who establish a kind of exchange and commerce with low value products or install industries for which the indigenous serve as cheap labor (incl.

Abstract : When one speaks of the pre-Columbian Andean musical instruments the first picture which comes to mind is that of the Inca Empire and its conquest by the Spaniards. However, very important civilizations, possessing a high degree of cultural evolution, were developed well before that empire on the Pacific coast of Peru as well as in the central and southern Andes. Custodians of undeniable expertise in the instrumental field, they produced a certain number of instruments still used today in the Cordillera but which have disappeared completely from the coast, their region of origin. What hap- pened in the interval of time and what was the itinerary followed by these instruments and their owners in the course of history? (incl.

These influences can be ob- served in several fields - in religion, language, folk traditions, culinary art, jewelry, but also especially in the field of music ( candomblé , xangôs or macumbas ), dance ( batuque , tango, samba, jongo, coco ) and musical instruments ( berimbau , tambor , etc.). Transformations were made. New contributions made additions. But in a general way, the African presence still persists in the daily life of the Brazilian people and is easily perceived (incl.

Abstract : The relationship of the masks of upper Central America to the northern neighbor of Mexico is worthy of study. The gathering of account books of the various morerias is of primary importance in tracing the diffusion of masks throughout the region. Regional variations of masks for one particular dance, such as the Moros y Cristianos, need to be carefully examined. The actual carving of the wood masks need to be carefully chronicled. Yet, no matter how much data is gathered in the future about the role of masks in the dance-dramas, one aspect will remain constant. Esteban Xolop of Rabinal stated it very well when he commented: "Each baile is part of a community religious art." Masks will only be clearly understood when seen as an integral part of such an art (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Max Peter Baumann: "Music of the Indios in Bolivia's Andean Highlands (Survey)," 80-98. Abstract Among the important characteristics of Indio music is the fact that the original music instru- ments such as pan-pipes (sikus), notched flutes (various types of quenas) and duct flutes (a great num- ber of pinkillos) play almost without exception in "choral" formation. The music groups of the Indios (tropa) in contrast to the city groups of mestizos (conjunto), do not present different sorts of music instruments playing together; that is, sikus, quenas, pinkillos and charangos will not be mixed in an ensemble. A tropa among the Indios consists of six, twelve, fourteen or up to thirty and more musi- cians. Although in most cases there is no direct ruling on the number of players, since the different large instruments of the same type can be played by more than one person, in view of the instruments tuned in three or four different registers, there may often be twice or four times the number of players. Hence, a tropa very often consists of six or twelve players (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Linda L. O'Brien: "Marimbas of Guatemala: The African Connection," 99-104. Abstract : The African origin of the Guatemalan marimba is a theory that has been widely accepted for some time, although its exact provenance has not yet been discovered. It is based on the total lack of archaeological evidence for its existence among the pre-Columbian Maya, and on the similarity of its construction to that of the xylophones of Central Africa. In the tiny, remote village of San Marcos La Laguna in Guatemala, I was fortunate to be able to record marimba music which still retains a number of features of African musical style (incl.

Articles • Narayana Menon: "The Language of Music," 3-34. Abstract : Fact is that the last three hundred years of history have been a Western dominated one. Euro- pean music, in this context, began to be considered by the West as the norm of all music. Also, during the period of colonization, the colonial powers took their cultures to their colonies in Africa and Asia and planted them there, often clearing up the "weeds" of indigenous cultures and traditions. Many Af- rican and Asian countries have suffered badly from this cultural colonization as they were not strong enough to withstand the forces set in motion by the colonial powers. The upright piano in an English medium school became the symbol of musical education for them. Some of these countries, after in- dependence, are trying hard to find their lost bearings and rehabilitate their traditions. There were, of course, some countries like India and Indonesia who had musical traditions not only robust to with- stand such incursions, but even resilient enough to welcome them (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Paolo Ansaloni: "The Acoustic Dynamics of Bridges of Bowed Instruments (An Outline of Comparative Instrument-Making," 35-56. Abstract : The brief outline that I am going to sketch out of the subject of the acoustic dynamics of bridges of bowed instruments arises from a number of observations I arrived at while restoring an Indian sarangi. The sarangi, which originated in the late Middle Ages, is a bowed instrument that is still widespread in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nepal. The body of the instrument is carved out of a single piece of wood. Over its belly parchment is stretched, which provides a good resonance top, and on the parchment a bone bridge is set. A leather belt, fastened on both sides of the instrument, sup- ports the bridge, thus preventing it from breaking the skin. Three main gut strings are stretched across the bridge; they are usually tuned to G2, D2, G1. Having studied the sarangi under Master Hanuman Prasad Mishra, I have become personally aware of the rich timbre qualities of this instrument, as well as of its "openness" to all sorts of sliding effects. I am now certain that although it may look very old, the sarangi is an extremely refined instrument which betrays deep understanding of the acoustic laws and of all the techniques which are fundamental in the art of professional instrument-making (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Judith Lynne Hanna: "Is Dance Music? Resemblances and Relationships," 57-71. Abstract : For purposes of cross-cultural comparisons, I conceptualize dance as human behavior com- posed - from the dancer's perspective as 1) purposeful, 2) intentionally rhythmical, and 3) culturally patterned sequences of 4a) non-verbal body movements 4b) other than ordinary motor activities, 4c) the motion having inherent and aesthetic value. Elsewhere I elaborate this conceptualization and its implications. Like dance, we can define music as 1 ) purposeful, 2) intentionally rhythmical, and 3) cul- turally patterned sequences of 4a) non-verbal body movements (4b) other than ordinary motor activi- ties. However, the divergence comes with the last part of the conceptualization of dance: (4c) motion having inherent and aesthetic value. Accepting that movement in music usually attains some degree of independent aesthetic value, sound is, however, the primary value and product of music. Physical body movement is not an end in itself as in dance. Rather, in music, physical body movement is a means to an end. Tactile movement does not occur separately from sound, while in dance, sound may be a by- product of movement (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Jeran During: "Music, Poetry, and the Visual Arts in Persia," 72-88. vol. 24, 1982(1)</page><page sequence="205">2. Contents and Abstracts • 223 Abstract In a preceding article, we had suggested in what way the traditional arts of Iran, and especial- ly the music, were the expression of a metaphysics of the imaginai, which grows out of a mystic theol- ogy in which a privileged place was provided for the beautiful vision, for the resurrection of the subtle body. We intend to take up again here the question of the unity of expression in the traditional arts, by regarding them no longer from above, from a philosophical point of view but, rather, from below, at the level of the forms and structures. The field which particularly interests us is that of Persian music which, as always when it is a question of music, is cautiously excluded from an inclusive approach to Iranian art as a whole, without realization of the fact that for the Orientals its place in the culture is far more important than that of the plastic arts or architecture (incl.

Articles • John Emigh: "Masking and Playing: Observations on Masked Performance in New Guinea," 5-25. Abstract : Appearing as hybrids of the animate and inanimate worlds, masks are particularly effective as "transitional objects" in the performance events that cluster around "liminar occasions. In the West, the mask has been devalued and is generally regarded as a cosmetic disguise, rarely used on the stage and often deprecated in the metaphors of everyday speech. People are accused of "masking" their in- tentions or feelings, or of "hiding behind a mask." Actors are praised for their abilities to reveal the feelings of the individual character "behind the social mask." The tendency is to speak of the mask as an impediment to expression, protecting and hiding the individual, corrupting understanding, and dis- figuring truth. In New Guinea, though, as in many other areas of the non-Western world, the tendency is to regard the mask as an instrument of revelation, giving form to the ineffable and providing a nexus between the individual and those communally defined forces that shape his sense of human possibili- ties. Commonly, this is accomplished by linking the mask to an ancestral presence, thereby bringing the past into the present and minimizing the break in continuity (incl.

They are most often the figuration of dead ancestors which is present in the masks in some way. Most often the masks are made and exhibited in a privileged relationship at the house of the men, in the faint light of which the most significant actions are carried out. The construction of the masks is not reserved for a group or class of artists. Their fabrication is the action of that man who, according to his place in the society and in the kinship network, is capable at the moment of a specific ritual, to make a mask (incl.

Abstract : A heterogeneous group speaking various dialects of the Yoruba language has variations in their cultural patterns. One of these variations is in their religion. All Yoruba peoples recognize a com- mon High God (Olorun, Oluwa or Olodumare), and a few deities such as Ogun, associated with war; Eshu, the trickster; Orunmila connected with Ifa divination; and Osanyin deity of medicine. These are other deities are associated with specific localities and ethnic groups. The masking rituals which form part of the yearly ceremonies are by and large identified with specific groups. Among the Oyo Yoruba, and Yoruba groups which have in the past come under the political domination or cultural influence of Oyo and later, Ibadan Empire, there are masquerades which are connected with the veneration of the ancestors. On both sides of the Nigeria/Benin Republic border, there are Gelede masquerades as well as Oyo type ancestral masquerades. Agemo, Agbo and Ekine are three of the masquerades among the Ijebu Yoruba group (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Nicole Revel Macdonald: "Masks in Kalimantan Timur," 52-57. Abstract : The term to designate "mask" in Kalimantan is hadoq or udoq. The beautiful masks are at- tracting the good protective Spirits of the Rice as well as chasing away all kinds of pests and threats. To make the masks dance is to fertilize the Earth as well as human beings. They help by their beauty the whole of nature to be fruitful: the fields to grow abundant rice and the mothers to bear children, for they give pleasure and transmit energy to nature. In the same manner, the Kayan people make their masks dance and they have a great variety of them: furthermore, they play in daily life a small bamboo xylophone (utan ok) in the fields to please the Spirit of the Rice. In the Modang music for the accompa- niment of the hadoq dance, two gongs ( gung ) are sounding on the opposite sides of the village borders, one upstream, the other downstream as they proceed from the forest to converge on the central area of the village where the ritual is to be held (incl.

Abstract : Native tribes of North America have used masks as ritual disguises, as aids in the identifica- tion with supernaturais. Surviving impersonations are distinctive, spectacular, and meaningful, be they individual or collective. The purposes, forms, and materials depend largely on the natural environment. Theriomorphic masks reflect the wildlife of earth, sky, and sea. Anthropomorphic masks visualize dei- ties in charge of weather control and of human wellbeing. Masks fusing animal and human features combine the powers of several supernaturais (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). Book Reviews, 69-75 (also in German and French). • Josef Kuckertz: "Thomas Marcotty.

The writing of music history has relied primarily on other written sources. Some of these sources, like those of the Greeks, tell much about music; some, like those of Asia and the West, include bodies of music notation. Included in the writing of any history of music must be consideration of other kinds of sources, like the findings of archeology, ethnology, iconography, cultural geography and so forth. All these sources have to be evaluated and re-interpreted in the light of actual performance practice still in usage today. All musical performance, from gamelan munggang to electronic music, contains a residue of past musical practices. - If I am right, much of the history of Western music needs rewriting - from the radiance of antiquity to the present (incl.

There seems to be a shift of focus from investigations into "meaning" in music viewed in terms of the musical experience to considerations of "meaning" in terms of general culture, whereas these should be complementary and not mutually exclusive. We are constantly reminded: (a) That "mu- sic has no separate existence" (in spite of its institutionalization and the complex organization that sup- ports it in some societies); (b) that music is a part of culture or a functioning part of culture and derives its "meaning" from culture; (c) that "no music has its own terms: its terms are those of its society;" (d) that "music sound" has no meaning apart from "music behavior;" (e) that "music confirms what is already present in society and culture and adds nothing new except patterns of sound." Considerations such as these have led to the emergence of at least four different approaches as ethnomusicologists search for a meaningful application of the concept of culture to the study of music: 1. the cultural theme approach; 2. the causal relations approach; 3. the contextual approach; and 4. the cultural factor approach (incl. Kurzfassimg/Résumé). • Simha Arom: "New Perspectives for the Description of Orally Transmitted Music," 40-62. Abstract. Regardless of its social role, however, each and every ethnic music depends on a systematics of its own; in the same way as a language, it has its grammar, and, as such, is governed by rules based on a theory which, truly enough, is most frequently implicit. Because of this double nature of the musi- cal phenomenon in this kind of society, one can make out two different, not to say contrary, approaches: the first one consists in studying music essentially as a social fact, the second one as a formal system. Each approach means a choice - which generally depends on the research worker's training and on his conscious or unconscious motivations - this choice meaning, in its turn, that a priority will be given to one aspect rather than to the other (incl.

Abstract : The S 52 is an electronic musical instrument with a particular type of keyboard, easy to utilize, which is built according to the theories presented by Alain Daniélou in his book Musical Se- mantics (1978). The instrument has been realized by two electronic experts, Claude Cellier and Andre Kudelski, in the technical department of the Kudelski works in Lausanne where the famous Nagra tape-recorders are built. Based on observations on the psycho-physiological effect of intervals corre- sponding to precise numerical factors, this instrument presents new possibilities for the study of extra- European music. But it also offers a sound material extremely diversified and precise to the modern composer, since it permits completely new sound effects and expressive structures. It is also a basic instrument indispensable for musical therapeutics. Musical structures utilizing particular groups of intervals, which can for the first time be realized on this instrument, have a powerful psycho-physio- logical effect. The instrument offers a range of eight octaves each of which is divided in 54 intervals (incl.

Abstract : As for a conclusion I confess to some embarrassment that the question for the methods of eth- nomusicology that were supposed to have been applied to Western art music is always posed by a West- erner. The time has come for an Easterner or an African to be asked to give us an analysis of Western music in an Eastern or African way. What methods would they use to learn to know Bach's Forty-eight or Stravinsky's Rite or Reger's Canons and Fugues? Would these simply be the vocabulary and meth- odology of Western pedagogy and speech study or would new approaches - new, that is, for the West- ern music enquirer - be developed, approaches that came from the mind and soul of the non-Western musician? In short, they should ask questions of Western music the way the West is asking questions of the Orient and Africa. The problem is who is doing the applying? (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé).

The saints and spirits each have their own tunes and a given melody (with or without a sung text) is said both to attract the spirit and to indicate its presence. Thus, the performance of a par- ticular tune may be used to summon the saint or spirit who "owns" that melody; if the music then sends one of the participants into trance that is taken as proof that the spirit has responded to the summons. In other cases the spirit may first possess a devotee, and then express (through the dancer's mouth) its desire for the appropriate tune. The trance state is hastened by various ceremonial accouterments de- manded by the spirit (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Shui-Cheng Cheng: "The 'Anti-Music' Theory of the School of Mozi," 14-19. Abstract : Modi (circa 500^16 B.C.), creator of the school of Mozi is violently hostile to the aris- tocratic class and to so-called "well-born" men who without contributing to production, depend on others. Different from Confucianism, the school of Mozi puts the emphasis on the utilitarian aspect of things and regards music from the viewpoint of its practical usefulness to the people. The anti-music reasoning of Mozi is naturally open to criticism; not being a musician nor a connoisseur of music, he presents only the negative sides of music and of its bad usage while neglecting its positive aspects. However, his argumentation against the bad usage of music by the aristocratic class of his time is not without value if one takes the circumstances of the time in which he lived into consideration (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Noémi and Avner Bahat: "Some Notes on Traditional Scriptural Reading Hand Movements as a Source to the Dance of the Yemenite Jews," 20-25. Abstract : When singing from the Diwan (paraliturgical book of devotional poems), the Yemenite men accompany their singing with spontaneous hand movements related to the contents of the poem as well as to its poetical and musical meter, adding hand-clapping and clicking of the fingers in a free but styl- ized way. The dancing of the male Yemenite Jews is based exclusively on the singing of the Shira part of the Diwan poems which is the central musical event at any social or ceremonial gathering (shira = literally "singing"). The texts, written in the Middle Ages and later, were copied by hand while the music and the dance were transmitted orally from father to son. Hence, the dance is linked with the poem and the written text is the basis of all body movement. Since movement is so closely connected with text in the performance of the Diwan, it is logical to assume that those same movements have their source in the manual signs which are used as mnemotechnical aids in the reading of the scriptures (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Pierre Arozarena: "Notes on Some Mossi Drums of Upper Volta," 26-34. Abstract : The fabrication of a "sacred drum" is exceptional in the life of a griot and consequently car- ries with it greatest importance. But why is he so persevering and why are so many precautions taken? On this point, opinions are unanimous: any deterioration of the object has the value of a message, usu- ally of bad omen. If a drum membrane is torn, this can signify the dissatisfaction of the spirits of the ancestors (Yab 'ramba), the announcement of the death or illness of a member of the family or even a risk of being poisoned (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé ). • Byong Won Lee: "Korean Court Music and Dance," 35-5 1 . Abstract : Although there were numerous small changes as they were passed down through the centu- ries, Korean court music traditions experienced less change in many aspects than comparable traditions of other East Asian countries. Thus Korean court music has special historical significance in the study of the emergence and development of East Asian court traditions since it preserves such long forgotten Chinese musics as yayueh (lit. "elegant music") of the Yuan Dynasty ( 1 260-1 368) and tz 'u of the Sung Dynasty (960-1279). Notwithstanding its significance, Korean court music has often been misrepre- sented as a byproduct of neighboring countries. This brief introduction seeks to outline the essence of the performing art traditions of the Korean court through discussion of the aesthetics of court music and dance, the historical development and contemporary practice of aak (court ritual music of Chinese origin), hyangak (court banquet music of Korean origin), tangak (Chinese court banquet music in Ko-</page><page sequence="210">228 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) rea), court banquet dances of hyangak and tangak repertoires, and the role of court music institutions and musicians (incl.

Abstract-. As in the case of historiography in general, musical historiography is the product of the European scientific or scholarly spirit; consequently, it is more or less natural that the concept of "the history of music" was for a long time identical with that of the history of European music. Although the first histories of music devoted important chapters to the musics of a few non-European peoples, all of that only served to show an inherent belief whose basis may be summed up in the following way: the great antique musical cultures such as the Egyptian, the Chinese or the Indian, acted as a prelude without continuity to the history of European music with the exception of the Greco-Roman music and theory, from which the rich vegetation of European music took root and flourished. This attitude, incidentally erroneous and typically Eurocentric, persisted up to the turn of the century - from the 19th to the 20th - when a more realistic and open approach, fostered by the new branch of musicology, "comparative musicology," set out to place musical historiography on more just and solid foundations. The first grandiose result of these efforts was the historical part of the Encyclopédie de la Musique et Dictionnaire du Conservatoire by Albert Lavignac ( 1913-3 1 ), a unique enterprise of its kind to create a truly first universal history of music (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • J. H. Kwabena Nketia: "Africa in the World of Music," 19-28. Abstract. It is envisaged that a history of music in Africa would provide a number of profiles which would relate Africa to the wider world while focusing on the general historical trends evident from the study of the music of different groups, and observations that relate to musical usages that are either partially within or completely outside it. It would begin by establishing the common identity of the mu- sical cultures of Africa with particular reference to contextual organization, performance organization, modes of expression and performance practice, instrumental resources, form and structure, and general vol. 22, 1980 (3)</page><page sequence="211">2.

This would be followed by a discus- sion on the historical background, with particular reference to the general socio-political and cultural history of the main regions: the Sahara, Sudanic area, East Horn, Eastern Africa, Central Africa, South- ern Africa, and Malagasy. Attention would be drawn to the distribution patterns of music in these areas and the modes of interaction that may have given rise to them. Expositions of music history in different epochs would follow and would deal with: 1. Music and pre-history in Africa; 2. Music in the Early Iron Age (up to the 10th century A.D.); 3. Music in the Islamic era (A.D. 725-1400, 1700-1800); 4. Music in the later Iron Age (from 15th to mid 19th century); 5. Music in the colonial era and after; 6. Contemporary trends. In addition to the foregoing, special case studies would be provided in order to deal with music outside the mainstream: The music of Ethiopian Church; The music of Bushman and Pygmy societies. The history would then conclude with extensions of African music in the Americas and the Caribbean (incl. Kurzfassung/Rèsumë). • Trän Van Khê: "For a Universal History of Music. What is lacking in Present-Day 'Histories of Music,'" 29^5. Abstract : Obviously, the principal periods of the history of music differ from one country to another. Certain countries have written documents (European countries, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, etc.). Others have only information transmitted orally from one generation to the next, as in the countries of Africa. It is difficult to conceive the editing in the near future of a veritable universal history of music. But it is possible to sketch for each continent a general picture with the "cultural areas," and cultural exchanges or the migrations of instruments from each cultural area or between cultural areas which will be easier to determine (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Mervyn McLean: "Approaches to History in Oceania," 46-55. Abstract : Earlier I pointed out that the cultures of Oceania are predominantly tribal and until recently were non-literate. Because of this their music history, except insofar as it is enshrined in a recoverable oral tradition or can be deduced from musical instruments, is undocumented. There are no manuscripts with which to work; and contact with Europeans is mostly too recent for any systematic body of written observation to have accumulated, much less in the necessary time depth for any "history" to be possible which would meet the requirements of conventional scholarly standards. Moreover, because ethnomu- sicology is a relatively young discipline - dominated even now by attention to musics elsewhere than in Oceania - relevant professional studies are few. For these reasons, I believe that approaches to music history in Oceania must, by and large, begin in field, with the study of music as currently practiced and any but tentative conclusions about the history of music styles or behaviors postponed until a sufficient body of material has accumulated (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Luis Heitor Correa de Azevedo: "Preliminary Study on the Project of Preparing a Universal History of Music and on the Role of the Music of Latin America and the Caribbean in this History, "56-65. Abstract : In the Americas the situation is entirely different. Here the music consists essentially in a pro- longation of European musical heritage. In terms of descent and culture large sections of the population remain close to Europe and it is therefore not surprising that both folk and art music conform to the rules of composition which govern European music. Here and there the Indio heritage makes itself felt through performances which may be profoundly original but remain in the sphere of folk music. Every- where, with of course strong concentration in certain regions, one also finds African descendants who faithfully retain their ancestral culture and music. These Indio and African islets have their counterpart in a fundamentally national music tradition in which the spirit of the music embodies traits peculiar to Indios or Africans respectively, even though the musical idiom and the instruments used are European in character. The methodology of dealing with Latin American music within the framework of this project is diametrically opposed to that which will be used in connection with the music of other parts of the world. In fact, each section of the universal history of music must have its own methodology; that used for Europe will certainly not be suitable for Asia, nor can the one for Asia serve the music of Africa (incl.

Abstract : Historically, it is that music which was first developed in the Arab Peninsula in pre-Islamic times, continued to develop during the Islamic era and had its schools and centers in Mecca and Me- dinah (632-850 A.D.: Ancient classical music tradition); in Baghdad and Cordoba (820-1258 and 1492): Revival of the ancient classical music tradition); and thereafter had its centers scattered all over the Middle East and North Africa from the 13th century up to our modern times. Empirically, it is the music listened to, performed and enjoyed by those who call it Arabian, namely the Arabs themselves and their neighbors the Turks, the Iranians, the religious and ethnic minorities living with the Arabs as well as the Ethiopians and African people bordering Arab countries in West and North Africa. Arabs are not only those living in the Arab Peninsula, i.e. Saudi Arabia, but all those who live in an Arab state, speak Arabic and carry out an Arabian culture. Arabian culture itself is based on the Arabic language, Islam and tradition. Musicologically, it is the music characterized by its tonal system, rhythmic-tem- poral organization, its modal structure, its musical instruments, its composed and improvised forms - instrumental as well as vocal - and through the social occasions on which it is performed, from which sophisticated and less sophisticated categories of sacred, secular and entertainment forms result (incl.

Musical language is by its very nature the most abstract form of language, one which can be expressed in terms which are almost entirely mathematical. Consequently, music can also be for us, as the Greeks, Arabs and Hindus felt it to be, a means of understanding the functioning of our thought as well as of our emotional sensitivity, a sort of link between number, material and thought.

In fact, the magical values of certain musical forms, the way in which they can be used to provoke states of trance, free man from the agitations of conscious mental activity and create the climate in which mystical ex- perience becomes a real possibility, all of this justifies the primordial importance attributed to music among the other sciences in many civilizations (incl.

Abstract : One may well wonder whether a subject such as the role of music in the education of man is not somewhat marginal in an epoch such as our own, when even the value of music itself is sometimes questioned and when its psychological significance at very profound levels is far from being always granted. If we look back into the past, however, and into the history of different civilizations, we can easily realize that the greatest importance was officially given to the role of music as well as to the unifying experience which it must have represented. It is only in the modern period and in our time that one tends to separate the diverse aspects of the artistic function and experience in studying them isolated from each other, according to different methods belonging to different disciplines, and that one has come to consider sometimes the arts and music more as an essentially useless aesthetic luxury, as the American philosopher George Santayana has put it, than in its unity and as a whole, as a powerful symbolic means of communication between individuals, men and divinities, or as an important me- dium for intuitive knowledge, or even revelation, or still again, according to the fascinating theories of Erich Neumann's "Art and Time" (1966), as a reflection of the contents of the underlying archetypal world which regulate the great historical and socio-cultural changes (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Jánoš Kárpáti: "Non-European influences on Occidental Music (A Historical Survey)," 20-37. Abstract : The European art music, based on Christian liturgy, is not the continuation of Greek and Latin music but, indeed, of Hebrew and Syrian music and that of Asia Minor. We cannot go into great detail here, and it suffices to mention the Byzantine, Coptic, Ethiopian and Mozarabic Christian chants. These remarks are not uniquely applicable to the musical traditions of the periphery of Europe: in fact - as Higini Anglès emphasizes it in Latin Chant before St. Gregory (1954) - the Orient has exercised a decisive influence on the development of Ambrosian chant itself. Furthermore, we find ourselves here in the presence of an influence which seems to have been uninterrupted even when we take into account nothing more than the interdictions of the Church Fathers regarding "excessive chro- maticism of an Oriental type" in the chant (incl.

Abstract The process of deformation of musical identities has been going on in the world through cul- tural export and import between rich and poor countries. Deformation of musical identities is a dire or indirect result of cultural colonialism. There is an active cultural colonialism which powerful countries export their culture and impose it at all levels and in different ways on weak countries; and there is passive cultural colonialism in which weak countries import foreign cultures of powerful countries. In both active and passive cultural colonialism, economic and psychological factors play major roles in carrying out the process of cultural "distortion," whereby the passive cultural colonialism is doubtless suicidal. Whose duty is it to control the process of destructive change? (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Avner Bahat: "The Musical Traditions of the Oriental Jews: Orient and Occident," 46- 58. Abstract : It is commonly accepted, both within the Jewish community and outside it, to refer respec- tively to the Oriental and Occidental communities as Sephardic and Ashkenazic (Sef arad and Ashkenaz are the Old Hebrew names for Spain and Germany respectively). The distinction between these two traditions stems from a historical split in the Jewish Diaspora, but became particularly acute in recent centuries with the rise of the Ottoman Empire. It was then that two completely separate centers of rab- binical training were established - in Istanbul for the Sephardim and in Eastern Europe for the Ashke-</page><page sequence="214">232 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) nazim. In Israel, this separation is institutionalized only in the Rabbinate; efforts are made elsewhere to overcome the historical rift, which constitutes a danger to the nation's unity. Still, an examination of Jewish cultural traditions unearths an even richer pluralism within each of these two main streams. It is the aim of this article to explore the many musical traditions of Oriental Jews (incl. Kurzfassung/ Résumé ). Book Reviews • Laurent Aubert: "Nikhil Gosh.

Abstract : If one thinks of the thousands of occasions on which, in all corners of the world, the use of masks is closely linked to a ritual, a ceremony or form of theatre in all of which music always plays an essential role, one will understand better our desire to illustrate some important aspects of what has come to be the context of music. It goes without saying, of course, that the more familiar these aspects are, the better one is able to perceive the event which (attends as an organic whole, whether it be the Chinese opera or the dances of the American Indians, Melanesian ceremonies or Javanese theatre. So it is this purpose in mind - to contribute to a better understanding of the musical picture from a cul- tural point of view that the present issue of this journal is on this occasion devoted to masks, whereas we may turn our attention in the future to other aspects of the musical context (also in German and French). • Soedarsono: "Masks in Javanese Dance-Dramas," 5-22. Abstract : Speaking about masks in Javanese dance-dramas stimulates me to trace the functions of the masks in the past, with the hope that it may clarify hidden meaning of their roles in their aesthetic uses.

Abstract : Numerous folk dances of South American traditional cultures frequently call for mask wear- ers who represent specific characters in the performance of dramas, plays or festivals. This form of disguise acts as a symbolic representation of the essential attributes attached to the various dramatis personae in a particular performance. The fundamental uses and functions of masks associated with social and religious life do not differ markedly from those of other traditional cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania or North America. What creates the uniqueness of many South American masked dances is the array of strongly divergent influences whose combination often epitomizes the very ethnohistorical development of a given community or group. This brief account only intends to provide some repre- sentative examples of the uses and functions of masks in some selected folk dances and festivals. The fairly complex relationship between belief systems (often involving totemism) and the aesthetic con- sideration in the making of masks, between mythical world views, social orders and the wide range of meanings of masked dances, is deliberately omitted in this overview (incl.

Abstract The two most ancient forms using masks in Japan are the choreographic forms of the gigaku and the bugaku which doubtless had their origins in Western Asia (India, Assyria, Babylon) and which were transmitted to Japan by China and Korea. Korean musicians, around the 6th century, introduced the gigaku to Japan, very probably in its original form which it had before being altered and refined in the Tang period. As for the bugaku, which came to Japan only around the 8th century, it probably had already the more elaborate form which the Imperial Court of the Tangs had given it. Furthermore, the Japanese acquired the habit of designating by the name of bugaku an ensemble of choreographic forms of diverse origins, classified in two categories according to their sources and their date of entry in Ja- pan. Thus, one calls sa no mai (dances of the left) those dance forms coming from China and danced without masks and those coming from Western Asia or the Southeast, which are danced with masks. On the other hand, one groups together in the u no mai (dances of the right) dance forms with masks originating in Korea and Northeast China. And the last Japanese form with masks is the nõ theatre, which was developed in the 1 3th century from folkloristic divertissements and achieved a fixed form in the 14th century, under the impulsion of Kannami and his son, Zeami. It was at this time that the nõ masks acquired their definitive form. It was not until the 1 7th century that we see emerge a non-masked theatre, the kabuki, developed from an intermediate form: the marionette theatre Qõruri) which acted as a transition between a play with masks and playing with un-covered face. However, even in the kabuki, one can find again in the heavy make-up of the principal actors a sort of substitute for the mask (incl.

This custom, widespread in the ensemble of Alpine areas of Central Europe presents striking similarities with the saturnalia of the Romans as well as with certain festivals of the German, Scandinavian and Celtic worlds. In spite of their anarchic and pagan appearances, these festivals ( Roitschäggätä of Lötschental, Nüsseier of Schwytz, Klause (masked yodelers of Appenzell), bell-ringers, etc.) were tolerated and even given patronage by the medieval Christian Church. The "Festival of Fools" ( Nar- rentanz), a veritable collective delirium parodying the liturgy and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or the "Festival of the Donkey," well known through novel of Fauvel at the beginning of the 14th century. The carnival, a phase of expansion "psychic outburst," often begins the day after Candlemas, festival of light and purification by fire, and it continues until Mardi Gras ( Güdelsystig ); it is then offset by the forty days of fasting and contrition of Lent, from Ash Wednesday to the night before Easter. In some other regions, the masked festivals take place around the winter solstice, the moment of transition in the annual cycle (incl.

The symbolic facial designs are the result of a thousand years of a kind of collective, computerized artistic physiognomy, so that the patterns of the five facial areas (in addition to body costuming) reveal the nature of the stage character. We can say that the per- sonality and significant traits are imprinted onto the character's face and can be read almost as a label. As an old Chinese proverb reminds us: "Whatever you do, good or evil, the deed is written onto your face, and the judgment of the people will live with you forever" (incl.

While the monks gathered inside the sanctuary recite the texts of office, others of them, dressed in sumptuous costumes and wear- ing masks ( 'bag), march into the courtyard of the monastery to reveal spatially and publicly, in the form of ballets, the presence of the divinities of whom they are supporters; all of this for the edification and good of the faithful.

Abstract : Like the tribal groups in other Southeast Asian nations, the Malaysian indigenous peoples have used the natural materials of their environments to create distinctive forms of musical instru- ments such as gourd and cane mouth organs, mouth and nose blown flutes, wooden xylophones, and bamboo stamping tubes. The knobbed gong culture so characteristic of Southeast Asia also permeates the jungles. Though only one or two gongs may be used in a tribal ensemble and they might be played for rhythm rather than for pitch, they are treasured family possessions and are treated with admirable respect. Malaysian tribal music is functional; no art for art's sake. One function of particular interest to persons from the so-called civilized world is its use in spiritualism. A shaman without music is one without power and, while urban peoples elsewhere in the world may find some help from concert music as well as from psychiatrists, modern persons must admire and perhaps even be a little jealous of the mental curative efficiency of a skilled village bomor. As the text of Malaysian shaman songs and those of rural narrators appear in translations one can also begin to appreciate the poetical and literary talents that are maintained by Malaysia's jungle peoples (incl.

Instead, they prefer to credit some individual or institution with giving them a start in the music world. From a social and economic point of view this is, in fact, a logical position to take, since the process of becoming a mu- sician involves a great deal more than the simple acquisition of technique and repertory. An aspiring musician must learn the proper social behavior for a variety of performance situations. More important, any musician who wants the satisfaction of performing with and for other people must gain the rec- ognition of both audiences and fellow performers. Finally, particularly in the case of professionals, a musician must learn to deal with patrons and spectators in special ways if he expects any financial gain from performance. We will examine these and other elements of music education in Morocco by trac- ing three well-trodden paths towards becoming a musician: 1 . the inspiration of a saint; 2. apprentice- ship to a master musician; and 3. formal instruction in a conservatory or other government-sponsored institution (incl.

Sufyana Kalam or Sufyana Musiqi considered by the Kashmiris as their classical music oc- cupies the most prominent place among Kashmiri genres. Although it is often performed on secular occasions, Sufyana is a religious music, and it principally functions as music for ritual at Sufi meet- ings - mehfils. Sufism, or Islamic mysticism, is well established in Kashmir.

From the beginning Sufyana was associated with Sufism and enjoyed the generous support of courts. It was thus music of the elite. It seemed to flourish particularly during the reign of Sultan Zainul Abidin (1420-1470), the period considered the Golden Age of Kashmiri culture. In the last two centuries the political and eco- nomic instability of Kashmir had a detrimental effect on Sufyana, and today, in spite of the attempts to revitalize it on the part of cultural organization such as radio and the Academy of Arts, Culture and Language, it seems to be in a state of decline. The performances of Sufyana during Sufi meetings and secular concerts are not frequent, and the number of master performers is drastically diminishing. Now the only place where Sufyana is regularly performed is Radio Kashmir, Srinagar. Sufyana is a choral music and is performed by a group of four to seven musicians. Each musician functions as both singer and instrumentalist. There are four instruments used in Sufyana: santur, setar, saz-e-kashmiri and dokra. The main instrument is santur (incl.

Abstract : The life of the lãamt (association of the musicians of a village) and particularly the assign- ment of tasks and roles are strictly controlled. From the moment a man becomes a member (his name is then entered into a notebook) he must attend scrupulously to the communal activities; without pos- sibly falling down on the job and under pain of being fined. The fines are made principally because of absences from communal activities (meals, music, and dance, chiefly). There are also fines of money which sometimes constitute quite a large amount and this is placed in the account of the association itself. Collective music does not mean, of course, that everyone does the same things at the same times; one must distinguish at least three principal roles which are associated or combined: dance, song (which itself consists of a verse and a melody and which is successively intoned by a soloist and by alternating choirs of men and women), drum beating (which consists of several groups: fixed groups based on the principle of no limitation to the number of instruments and soloist groups, which consist of two or three performers). The drum soloists need to have certain virtuosity. Furthermore, the music forms are conceived in such a way that it is impossible to acquire the mechanisms of playing in practic- ing the music alone. The different parts are combined and interwoven, and the playing consists of a se- ries of rhythmic transformations which are introduced by one player against another part. As we see the collective practice thus conceived moves into a collective apprenticeship (incl.

Abstract : The recent past has witnessed an ever growing number of endeavors designed to take stock of contemporary musical life. These efforts cover different fields, such as the institutions devoted to music education and musical performances; the audience of musical performances; amateur musical activities; the musical repertoire of radio and television; the place of folk music in a process of social change triggered by economic, technical and other factors; changes in the musical behavior of young people; the place of music in the leisure-time budget of the population; the percentage of money spent on music out of private, national, regional and community funds, etc. A preliminary, bibliographical survey of relevant studies and reports has recently been prepared and published for the purposes of a study session to be held by the European regional group of the International Music Council. This ad- mittedly incomplete survey, covering several European countries, goes to show that the most diverse disciplines are involved in these efforts and that contributions to an inventory of contemporary musical life in industrialized countries are prompted by varied motives (incl.

In the Occident, the performer is an indispensable intermediary in transmitting a message from a creative musician, called a composer to a listener or a public, which receives it in silence, with- out any participation. In Asia, the performer was in most cases at the same time a creator. And when creation takes place at the same time as the performance one calls it improvisation. It may be said that very often the performer in Asia was an improviser. Even if he simply played a piece composed by his predecessors, he added to it a little something of his own. The performer was not transmitting a mes- sage but was expressing himself; he was speaking to a listener who answered him with sighs, shaking of the head, exclamations or one who even took part in the musical performance as we can observe it in the a dao songs and the traditional theatre of Vietnam, when the listener is holding the applause drum, the trong chau. The stereotype formulas of rhythms were to be used quite wittingly by a participating listener, a well-informed connoisseur, who punctuated the musical phrases and expressed his satisfac- tion or his disapproval. The musical performance thus became a creation or a re-creation in which, to a greater or lesser degree, the public was associated (incl.

Abstract : Music and dance were such an integral part of Venda traditional education from birth to marriage, that it was impossible for any person to escape the experience of performance. Not all herd boys played the three-holed transverse flute (îshitiringo), though many tried their hand at duets on the ocarina (tshipotoliyo), and soli on the tshihwana or derìde musical bows, but all had a repertoire of children's songs (Blacking 1967), knew several of the songs that accompanied formally told stories on winter evenings and all participated in play-dances (dzhombo). Girls, too, shared the story-songs, the play-dances and many of the children's songs, as well as having some of their own. Playing the lugube musical bow was a common marker of girlish identity, especially around the onset of puberty, at the same time as some youths took up playing the mbila tshipai (incl.

But, on the other hand, it is not indispensable and, in particular cases in which no musical instruments would be available, a religious ceremony could be easily performed without any music.

Moreover, the good quality of a musical performance, although appreciated, the more so that it is thought to be better pleasing to the divinities, is not essential: for religious purposes, it is quite enough for a musical performance to be correct (incl.

Abstract : We have to understand the role of music in Afghan society in terms of an underlying puritani- cal condemnation. However, music also has its positive values, as "food for the soul," as a reviver of the spirit, as an agent for exciting people, and in certain circumstances the moral prohibition on music is suspended. Thus music is considered an indispensable adjunct to festive occasions, notably wed- ding celebrations, the springtime country fairs and religious holidays ('eid-s). The prejudice against music per se is paralleled by a prejudice against musicians, particularly the kesbi-s, who are regarded in a vague sense as "bad people," who lie, cheat, who make excessive demands for money, who do not care about religion, whose wives are prostitutes and whose sons are dancing boys. Their behavior is regarded as deviating from the expressed ideals of Muslim society. Much less prejudice is directed against shauqi-s. The significance of the kesbi (professional )/shauqi (enthusiast) distinction lies in the fact that it is an important determinant and indicator of the musician's status. The data we shall be dis- cussing derive from male musicians in Herat, the third largest city in Afghanistan, with a population of about 125,000 (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • J. H. Kwabena Nketia: "The Performing Musicians in a Changing Society," 65-74. Abstract : In traditional society musical leadership may be sharply differentiated from organizational leadership. The latter kind of leader may or may not be an active performer or a person who plays an important musical role. Those who assume musical leadership however always assume important roles as cantor or as leading instrumentalist. The latter invariably plays the most complex parts in a musical performance and is regarded as a master musician. Often he plays his part in full knowledge of the oth- er parts, and can help other players out when necessary. The task of a lead performer - whether cantor or instrumentalist - is not merely to reproduce what he knows, but to present it creatively, to develop its communicative potential through the limited improvisations or variations that he introduces or through the verbal texts he creates. His relationship to the music he performs is, therefore, a very direct one, for as a creative performer, he does not just interpret the musical ideas of others but uses the piece - the composition - as a medium for projecting his own ideas and feelings, or his response to the context or environment in which he performs, as well as the sentiments of individuals, the community or those of the divinities with which men interact. It is from such performing musicians that others learn the art either through observation during performance or personal instruction or guidance given informally when this is requested. In general, the performing musician acquires his training in traditional society informally even where he undergoes a period of attachment to such a master musician, for in traditional society learning to perform is not merely a matter of acquiring technical competence. It is also a matter of developing attitudes and learning the body of traditions in terms of which music is made and inter- preted (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Byong Won Lee: "Evolution of the Role and Status of Korean Professional Female Entertainers ( Kisaeng )," 75-84. Abstract : Korean women called kisaeng were one of three classes of professional entertainers, com- parable to Chinese chi-nu, Japanese geisha, Indian deva dasi, and Arabic quina. Until recently, ethno- musicological studies have slighted the importance of the social role and status of those who perform music. The ojective of this article is to clarify developments in the role and status of kisaeng throughout the major socio-political changes in Korea. Sources on the kisaeng up to the end of the Koryo Dynasty (918 to 1392) are scant, partly because the Confucian scholars of the Yi Dynasty (1392 to 1910), who compiled and edited the documents we have, were reluctant to include subjects such as those concern- ing the kisaeng. However, we know that Koryo Dynasty kisaeng danced and sang at court banquets</page><page sequence="221">2. Contents and Abstracts • 239 and country-wide festivals to instrumental music performed by male court musicians. For the study of the historical peculiarities of kisaeng it is imperative to understand the socio-political circumstances that may have affected them. With Buddhism as the Koryo Dynasty's ideological foundation, women of the ruling classes had relatively free social mobility and access to political affairs through husband, lover, or son in high posts. Many of the concubines of Koryo kings were chosen from the kisaeng and given noble title and rank, thereby elevating their status from the lowest social caste to the highest (incl.

Our Central European culture badly needs a general musical sensitizing - more than ever. One will come to recognize this in its full significance only in a few centuries, when the crisis of the "religion of science" begins to fade out and a time comes in which the musicality of man - the response of all rhythms in man and their harmonization through music is interwoven in the whole culture. Musical spirits must adjust themselves for a long time to come to the fact that they are in the truest sense "in the underground:" that they hold the life-preserving currents under the surface of the river (incl.

From historical chronicles to lyric poetry and from epics to certain literary works - all are sung, everything is put to music in order be better or more easily memorized and thus passed down to posterity. Kurdish music is, then, principally folk mu- sic and "anonymous." The circumstances of its origins and development are, in fact, very diverse and difficult to establish with accuracy. Originally, purely vocal, a song was often composed by a woman wishing to express her feelings of sadness or, more rarely, of joy. It might also break forth in the course of the poetic contests the young men and women indulged in on their return along mountain paths or at other gatherings of young people: nocturnal meetings in the village square, New Year's celebrations, marriage ceremonies, which might last from three days to three weeks. Or, then again, a song might be created from the blow of tragic events. Once the song is created, an instrumental accompaniment is added to it and it achieves anonymity through the intermediary of the dengbëj (bards) who disseminate it and popularize it in the course of their traveling from village to village, from encampment to encamp- ment (incl.

For lack of such a tool of research, it is impossible to uncover all that lies behind the music - the rules, the musical grammar, so to speak, and the syntax of the ensemble as well as of each musician during the performance of a piece. A useful tool is the analytical procedure of "re-recording" in combination of the "play-back" technique (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Dane L. Harwood: "Contributions from Psychology to Musical Universais," 48-64. Abstract : The study of human behavior offers some suggestions as to where to search for universais. However, we are not yet in a position to answer in detail or with great accuracy how to search, even if we knew all the "wheres." The paradox of a universal is that it is at the same time patently obvi- ous to us yet infuriatingly elusive. I hasten to add that the richness of music lies most certainly in the complexity and depth of symbolic meaning which musical behavior communicates. In some traditions, this communication is represented as an infinite variety of structure. In other traditions, musical mean- ing is represented by the complexity of interpersonal relationships between performers and listeners. My point is that context provides much of the meaning of musical performance: because contextual constraints change from culture to culture, structural or functional analyses of music fail to identify universais. It is not to a particular musical structure or function we should turn, but rather to the way in which human beings learn structures and functions. The process, not the content, of music-making is what communities have in common. Our common humanity lies in our ability to communicate sym- bolically (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumë). • Philip D. Schuyler: "Rwais and Ahwash: Opposing Tendencies in Moroccan Berber Music and Society," 65-80. Abstract : Among the 7as/*//H7-speaking Berbers (Ishlhin) of south-western Morocco, the performance of music is both a favorite form of entertainment and a socially significant act. For convenience, these forms can be classified into four categories: 1. village music, a variety of styles performed by amateur musicians; 2. professional music, performed by small, itinerant groups of musicians known as rwais; 3. the chanting of the Qur 'an and other religious texts, by scholars known as tolba; and 4. the music of the Gnawa, a black religious brotherhood. The latter two categories will not concern us here, because they are, essentially, foreign styles borrowed from Arabic and sub-Saharan African traditions respectively. Both village and professional music, on the other hand, are outgrowths of the indigenous culture. Vil- lage music itself can be divided into a number of genres and styles too numerous to examine in the present work. The epitome of village music, however, is the ahwash (lit.: dance), which is found in one form or another all over the High Atlas und Sus. In general, the ahwash is sung and danced by two large antiphonal choruses, accompanied by an ensemble of frame drums ( tallunt , pl.: tilluna; cf. the Arabic bendir). The performance emphasizes successively improvised poetry, choral song, dance, and</page><page sequence="223">2. Contents and Abstracts *241 drumming. The rwais (sing.: rais) perform in small groups of up to a dozen musicians. The rwais travel and perform throughout northern Morocco and Europe as well. Their music is distinguished from the ahwash, and, indeed, from all other genres of Moroccan music, by the use of the rebab, a monochord fiddle, and the lotar, a four-stringed lute (incl.

Abstract : The etymological meaning of the word ch 'in is "to restrain" or "to prohibit;" this means that in playing this instrument, the emotions of the musician should be well controlled and the ugly states of mind such as impure thoughts, inimicality and animosity eliminated. This principle of "restraint" or "restriction" in relation to the atmosphere in performing the zither is as applicable to the listeners as to the musicians. Since long ago the literal meaning, through extension of the term ch 'in has become in China a synonym of the musical instrument (incl.

( 1 ) to be a court dancer one no longer needed to be of noble birth or a palace servant; (2) the Javanese court dance tradition continues despite the decline of the kraton way of life.

Abstract : In the following article I would like to discuss some aspects of symbolism found in Asian musical instruments, focusing on materials and zoomorphism. Ancient Chinese classified their musical instruments into eight categories according to the primary material used for construction. This system is called pa yin ("the eight [sources] of sound"), and consists of the following seven materials: metal, earth (or clay), skin, silk (threads), wood, gourd, and bamboo. This system is thought probably to be the oldest extant classification of musical instruments. This ancient system is actually too simple to be applied to later (and more elaborate) musical instruments, yet it reveals implicitly the profound sym- bolic relationship between material and instrument, and possibly the sound produced (incl. Kurzfas- sung/Résumé). • Alain Daniélou: "Symbolism in the Musical Theories of the Orient," 24-37. Abstract : The invention of string instruments has made possible practical and precise study of the relationships of frequencies which form the musical substance since lengths of strings are in inverse relation to the frequencies. It therefore became possible to analyze easily the relationships of tones in numerical terms and to establish a connection between the musical tones and the geometric symbols of the yantra and, furthermore, between the relationships of numbers, sound perceptions and psychologi- cal elements associated with them. This makes it possible to relate emotional factors to the numeri- cal formulas which, in turn, opens up astonishing horizons on the nature of sensation and thought in accordance with the cosmological conceptions. A complete theory results on the expressive value of numerical relationships, their link with diverse "states of the soul" - that is, with the 9 rasa (gaiety, tenderness, fear, disgust, eroticism, astonishment, heroism, anger, calm). Music thus becomes a sort of key to the nature of the world, since we find in numerical expressions referring to the structure of what is created - energy-space-time - and to its developments within the form (harmony, beauty) and within perception (sensation, thought, life). Musical observations have certainly played an important role in the definition of certain symbols (incl. Kurzfassung/Résumé). • Maria Rika Maniates: "Musical Symbolism, 38-55. Abstract Covert symbolism, especially the esoteric kind, poses a set of problems. Here the investigator tries to penetrate a secret world in which the enigma often foils attempts to discover incontrovertible contexts. Many these problematic cases involve devices with a purely musical meaning. Thus unless one can ferret out extra-musical contexts for interpreting triple canons as symbols of the Trinity, the issue will remain in doubt. Symbolic reading becomes even more complicated when we encounter a kind of symbolism buried in details of an apparently innocuous character. In this regard, the current spate of studies on number symbolism is fraught with dangers. The problem is that purely musical contexts seem highly hypothetical, and the penchant of scholars to vaunt their own gematric virtuosity strains the credibility factor. The only solution, it seems to me, is to study in greater depth the history of the non-musical evolution of this phenomenon in order to discover some relevant contexts outside the music (incl.

Sholem writes: "Such a common denomi- nator can, perhaps, be discovered in certain unchanging fundamental ideas concerning God, creation</page><page sequence="225">2. Contents and Abstracts • 243 and the part played by man in the universe. Two such ideas are namely the attributes of God and the symbolic meaning of the Torah." Indeed, through the mystical interpretation of the Torah, the mystic might find the way of mystical cognition of God and His revelation. Isaac Arama (d. 1494) says that the secret of music was delivered to Israel together with the Torah, while Ibn Sahula (13th c.) claims that the knowledge of the secret song leads to knowledge of the secret of the Torah. These statements indicate the close interrelationships of music and certain basic kabbalistic concepts; and the musical topics are so interwoven with the multitude of kabbalistic symbols that it is frequently difficult to dis- tinguish them. Therefore, we have to penetrate the hidden worlds sought by the mystic and to seize the scattered musical references in them, in order to understand the mystical symbolism assigned to this art (incl.

But because the story of the creation had to be retold and its variegated complex and subtle phe- nomena interpreted through the stories of the gods and the goddesses, heroes and heroines, the dance became necessary. In the process it evolved symbols powerful enough to convey the truths through movement. These symbols took various forms: poetry, singing, music, color, movement, images, sto- ries and its expression through body. The soul through the body expresses its desire to merge with the supersoul and join the cosmic dance of Lord Shiva. The exquisite Sanskrit verse epitomizes the uni- verse in Lord Shiva's dance.

Abstract : In sum, the synthetic, unitary, and dream-like contexts in which the Mapuche cultural con- figuration is given indicates that its music - basic means of non-verbal transcendent communication - cannot be an isolated expression. It denies that Mapuche music may have an autonomous nature, dis- connected from the cultural matrix to which it belongs. Indeed, we have that music is fused with the cultural whole, sharing the main features of its dominant patterns. World-view, myth and dreams, ritual performance, medical functions clarify and explain the symbolic extra-musical connotations of musi- cal practice. Dualism appears to be the basic clue. And musical language is able to communicate and project not only the basic cultural shapes - forms, structures and patterns - but also their inner mean- ings related to the integral ritual experience and its spiritual, emotional, mystical, and poetical contents. The kultrún is the symbolic microcosmos which best represents these musical and cultural correlations and, thus, the essence of Mapuche ritual art and creativity (incl.

Abstract : For the masters of Zen, intellectual reasoning and representational images are incapable of giving us a true knowledge of Emptiness, to which one can gain access only by intuition, for example, of a lapse of time as short as a spark lasts. The term katsu means, furthermore, literally "to be deprived of a word to express the state of sünyatär in which the ego, totally bereft of its individuality, succeeds in identifying with the Absolute and reaches a stage at which there is no longer either servitude or lib- eration from concrete things. For, one could not grasp the nature of the sünyatä with the aid of words or images, which make of it a human concept derived from our experience and subject to the limits of our conceptual understanding. For this reason one should try to attain the sünyatä by the direct "way" of cries and not by that of intelligible language or symbolic associations. We should mention in passing that the notion of sünyatä expresses something positive which the English words "vacuity" or "empti- ness" translate badly and evoke, rather, a certain negative nihilism (incl.

In the years 1974-1976 three of these Musiculturas were devoted to Orient-Occident encounters, a theme automatically involving discussions on dance, theatre, philosophy, religion etc. (also in German and French). • Anon.: "Preface," 7-14 (also in German and French). Abstract Among the most original and fruitful of the various Musicultura undertaking is the series of three East- West encounters summarized in the present report. The idea was first proposed and outlined by the eminent Dutch composer Ton de Leeuw, who had studied ethnomusicology with Jaap Kunst and who for many years had had a profound interest in the musics of non- Western cultures. His basic prem- ises were that the musics of the different cultures have much to offer to musicians and music lovers in today's world, that knowledge and enjoyment of these musics need not be limited to a small number of specialists, and that the optimal way of East- West musical exchange is not necessarily through formal congresses, lectures and courses but rather through informal meetings of musicians from all parts of the world (also in German and French). • Everett Helm: "About this Report," 15-18 (also in German and French). Abstract This report is on the one hand a record, documenting in broad outline the three East- West encounters. On the other hand, it is a kind of non-scholastic introduction to some non-European mu- sics - ten, to be exact. It contains information and points of view that can be useful to those readers in both East and West who are interested in the musics of the different cultures but who are not specialists. Indeed one of the most pertinent questions occupying scholars of all cultures has to do precisely with the relationships, cross-influences and acculturation among musics of various Eastern cultures and regions - often widely separated geographically (also in German and French). • Ton de Leeuw: "Questions, Ideas, and Expectations: Premises and Aims of an East- West Encounter," 19-33. Abstract In addition to economic and political realities there are a number of other matters which are important to us. One of them has to do with the world of our musical experience. Today the listener is confronted with unfamiliar musical idioms of other cultures much sooner than in the past. Two factors are involved: a) our conditioning, that is, the way perception and patterns of expectation are deter- vol. 20, 1978 (2)</page><page sequence="227">2.

China • Tsun-Yuen Lui: "Introduction to the Traditional Music of China," 36-39 ( Abstract : The following is a very condensed history of Chinese music and its function. In early times, music was the natural expression of people's personalities the reflection of their lives. Later, music was intertwined with political and social life, as is indicated in the old Chinese books still preserved, which refer to the influence of music on people's lives. The Book of Changes, for example, written during the Chou dynasty (1 122-256 B.C.), emphasizes that music can reform manners and customs; the Book of Rites mentions the harmonizing influence of music in bringing together statesmen and rulers, old and young, father and son. The Book of Music claims that music has its source in virtue and that it leads to social reform, while Confucius claimed that music leads to social harmony (incl. Zusammenfassung/ Resumé). • Wen-Chung Chou: "A Visit to Modern China," 40^44. Abstract : The sayings of Mao on the Cultural Revolution were of course the corner-stone of the new musical creativity - sayings such as that the past shall serve the present and the West shall serve China, through a process of selectivity. In fact, Cultural Revolution is the first step towards establishing a new society, and popularization of the arts must be achieved before musicians can concentrate higher stan- dards. This is why the Peking Opera is the point of departure for revolutionary music, having been in the past the most popular form of music; but there are also changes to suit the precepts of the Cultural Revolution (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • W. L. Idema: "Some Basic Characteristics of Traditional Chinese Society," 45^47. Abstract : We know that court musicians collected music from the people, and then adapted it so that it could be taught to the people as a proper expression of the right feelings, since regulation was consid- ered to be the essence of civilization. This meant however that the attitude of true Confucianists was unfavorable towards new music, since only the old music of the sages could serve as a model. Popular music was unacceptable. Confucian ceremonies contained music and dance, but this cult-music never became popular. Other non-state cults, such as Buddhism and Taoism, were musically of much greater importance (Zusammenfassung/Resumé). Vietnam • Trän Van Khê: "Vietnamese Culture and Music," 48-52. Abstract'. In Vietnamese art both Chinese and Indian influences can be distinguished - for example in the use of onomatopoeia as a method of teaching drum-playing and in the use of modal concepts. The assimilation of Chinese and Indian elements is apparent as well in traditional painting, architecture, script, theatre, etc. Vietnamese instruments include the monochord (dôc huyên), the same instrument that is known in China as i hien gin, in Japan as ichigenkin, in India as gopiyantra and in Cambo- dia as sadiou. Among the other instruments are the four-stringed lute (ty bà), which is similar to the Chinese pipa and the Japanese biwa, a brass drum used to frighten away bears and the dàn-day, a three-stringed lute, that according to legend is capable of curing diseases and brings happiness to the people. It is used in North Vietnam to accompany professional female singers (incl.

Abstract : Very important in the category of ritual music is chong-myo-ak, or royal ancestral music, commemorating the founders of the Yi dynasty. T'ang-ak is the Korean counterpart to Japanese togaku, i.e. music imported from T'ang China. It is quite easy to distinguish this music during the earlier pe- riod, but by the middle of the Yi dynasty the distinction becomes much more difficult. During this time a strong feeling of nationalism was guiding Korean music, and even court music adopted elements of folk music. The third category of court music is hyang-ak, "native" music considered to have origi- nated in Korea. This is roughly equivalent to komo-gaku in the gagaku repertoire. The relationship of these two suggests the possibility that one originated in Korea and was later brought to Japan. In chung-ak the stands instrument is the kayakeum. The tension of the strings is very loose compared with the koto, and this allows for great rhythmic variety and an elaborate left hand technique (incl. Zusam- menfassung/Resumé). • Isang Yun: "The Contemporary Composer and Traditional Music," 57-60. Abstract In spite of all the differences, there is a common factor in Chinese, Japanese and Korean mu- sic: it is based on the individual note, which is independent of melodic context, and which has a com- pletely different character from that of a single tone in a piece of European music. Whereas in Western music only a complete group of notes arranged either melodically or harmonically has any importance, it is the individual note, the nucleus, which is the focus of attention in the music of Eastern Asia (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resume). Japan • F. Vos: "Background to Japanese Culture," 61-63. Abstract : Japanese social and cultural patterns are very distinctive. In comparison to Western concepts, the individual is of little importance. The total denial of the "ego" by Buddhism prepared the way for feudalism which was reinforced by the influence of Confucianism. Duty is considered to be more im- portant than personal happiness. This may lead at times to an inner conflict between giri (duty towards society and family) and ninjô (personal feelings); in theatre this is a beloved theme, often leading to suicide by the person whose ninjô had assumed control over him. To show "character" in the Western sense is considered bad (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resume). • William Malm: "Japanese Music: A Brief Survey," 64-68. Abstract : In early times Japanese music was influenced by religion (Buddhism became the official religion in the 6th century) and by foreign culture - the China of the T'ang dynasty. In fact the domi- nant style of early gagaku music - the large court ensemble - came from China and it was then called T'ang music. Instruments used in gagaku ensembles include the sho (mouth organ, hichiriki (oboe), biwa (plucked lute), koto (zither), drums and gongs. The instruments can be heard as separate auditory entities in terms of timbre (the "chamber music ideal") in contrast to the "thicker" sounds of Western symphony orchestras or the 1940 jazz sound. Although the repertoire of gagaku music has remained the same for the last 1000 years, notations do not give the complete picture of how gagaku music must have been played (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resume). • Willem Adriaansz: "Music and Tradition of the Edo Period," 69-75. Abstract : Gagaku consisted of a mixture of professional musicians and court aristocracy, each hav- ing its own function, while noh theatre was confined to professionals. During the Edo period (1600- 1 860s), too, music was the concern of professionals, who were limited to a very specific group and most of whom were blind. They were organized as a guild, which, as well as protecting its members, also concerned itself with their standards, dividing them into ranks, the highest of which was called kengyô. Their pupils were children of both the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. The teacher/pupil rela- tionship was comparable to that of the Indian guru, where concern for the general welfare of the pupil is of the utmost importance and where the pupil himself seeks to emulate his mentor in every way.

The Philippines • José Maceda: "Introduction to Philippine Music," 78-81. Abstract : The Portuguese were in Southeast Asia before the Spaniards and there are geographical "pockets" which even today reflect a certain Portuguese influence. When the Spaniards came, how- ever, they brought and imposed their culture which has remained a dominant influence. They favored an intelligentsia of Filipinos who had studied in Spain. In the early 17th century, Gregorian chant and portable organs were taught by the friars. Later on, conservatories were founded in Manila. The result is that the Philippines were exposed during three centuries to a Western culture that produced changes in manners, behavior, philosophy, and in many facets of life. As in Latin America, one music looks towards the West and another derives from indigenous sources. This latter music is of special interest and is known to only a small fraction of the population (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • José Maceda: "The Music of the Flat Gongs," 82-85. Abstract : This music is played during rituals or as part of a ceremony to honor a rich man. It can go on all night long, with one group of players following the other. There may be several groups playing at the same time. This is the very opposite of court or concert music: it is entirely free and participation is open to all - rich and poor. In this "primitive" music there is a great sophistication. But to appreci- ate it, we have to get away from our usual ways of thinking and reacting. The occasions on which the groups perform include weddings, holidays, peace treaties, etc. Music on gongs is part of every feast (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). Indonesia • Ernst Heins: "An Introduction to Javanese Culture and Music," 86-88. Abstract : There is no evidence of gamelan orchestras prior to 1600, although the instrument itself ex- isted before that time. Various bamboo instruments were cultivated in all parts of the island. The first tape was of Western Javanese classical singing - a recording made in 1970. The classical gamelan Degung of West Java was cultivated by the nobility in former times. Today there are hundreds of these groups - in schools, universities, prisons, and elsewhere (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • Bernhard Suryabrata: "Lecture-demonstration of Javanese Music," 89-92. Abstract : Indonesia has several conservatories and music academies, some of which include traditional Indonesian music in their curricula. The National University, however, is the only institution in which Western music is not taught at all. In their research of indigenous musics, the students work from the ar- chives of former palaces; or they may gather unwritten information from elderly performers or keepers of instruments who were associated with palaces where old traditions were cultivated. The discovery of the past is very exciting but very difficult. Nobody, in fact, knows very much about Javanese music of the past. One can differentiate two main strands: that of Bali and Southern Java on the one hand end the general Indonesian on the other. Most are of the opinion today that influence of China and India has been less important than was formerly thought. But even in the 20th century, the character of Indone- sian music has undergone great changes. A hiatus with the past was created in 1910 when practitioners of traditional music were put out of work by the Sultan. In 1926, traditional music began being revived (incl.

Abstract : In his introductory remarks, the author said that the formal structure of "Gending" is of less interest in the given context than the way in which a Western composer uses an Eastern orchestra. He stated that as early as 1 954 he had discussed with Jaap Kunst the possibilities of using stylistic features of the gamelan in his own works. The results, as expressed in "Gending," had therefore taken a con- siderable time to mature. It was futile for a Western composer to imitate the Javanese tradition; rather he had utilized the music of Java in his own way - as a Western composer who intends to remain just that (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumě). • Frans Haryadi: "Modern Music in Java," 100-102. Abstract : The importance of traditional music is recognized by such organizations as the Jakarta Art Council, who consider it to be not a museum piece but living art. A major problem, however, is the fact that young musicians who cultivate traditional music are unable to use it in creating a new music. Mu- sic education is at fault here, since those institutions which teach the performance of traditional music do not teach composition as well (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumě). • Michael Hannan: "Eastern Music and the Australian Composer," 103-05. Abstract. In music, the search for an Australian identity presents problems. It would be logical to use native material, but the music of the aborigines is so simple as to be little value. Attempts to incorpo- rate aboriginal music into art music sounded "corny." Until recently music was strongly under British influence and tended to be conservative. In the 1960's a new phase begins, as composers look for of incorporating Asian elements into their music (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumě).

A number of eminent experts and musicians representing the related Arabic classical traditions also took part (also in German and French). Iran • Hormoz Farhat: "Form and Style in Persian Music," 109-18. Abstract : Like other musics of the Near East, traditional Persian music is monophonie, modal, essen- tially tetrachordal, based on diverse intervals and using a relatively narrow tonal range of two octaves that can be somewhat extended. But during a period of some four centuries (i.e. from the 16th century to recent times) the "scholarly," theoretical aspects of music suffered serious neglect. With the excep- tion of certain periods, the Islamic attitude towards music was never positive. But the Shiite religion was opposed to musical activity of any kind - actually purged music from the daily life of urban resi- dents (in rural areas, the effects were less severe).

India • Sumati Mutakar: "Form and Style in North Indian Music," 121-28. Abstract : Within a recognized and recognizable framework of a raga, the artist is given ample free- dom to express his personal style. Different artists will introduce subtle differences and shadings - for example in the ways in which they perform shakes, oscillations, and embellishments (, gamakas ) which are employed not as ends in themselves but as a means of forming phrases and of proceeding from one note to the next. Rãgas are thus identifiable, but they are subject to constant variation; within limita- tions, there is great flexibility. Also, subtle differences can be noted in the performance of rãgas from one region to another (Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • Rebecca Stewart: "North Indian Rhythm," 129-32. Abstract. The major social and political upheaval in primarily Northwestern India during the late 17th and 1 8th centuries opened the way for the intrusion of new ideas and instruments into a classical musi- cal tradition which had become highly structured. The prototypical tablã ("invented" in Delhi in the middle of the 1 8th century) was, with the sitar, one of the two most successful of the many contempo- rary attempts at instrumental cross-breeding. To explain the tablas chameleon-like ability to assume the repertoires and roles of the three main drum types which preceded it, one has to analyze the tablã s physical properties. The tablã is a hand-played, tuned pair of drums, both with complex heads, one of which, the metal or clay bãyãn, is of the naqqara type, the second of which, the wooden dãhinã, is a truncated version of the higher pitched half of the pakhãvaj. Due to its structure, the tablã alone, of all four drum types, is capable of showing great variety of timbre (as the pakhãvaj ), subtle variation in pitch (as the dholak), and great contrast, dynamics, and speed (as the naqqara) (incl. Zusammenfas- sung/Resumé). • Wim van der Meer: "The Influence of Social Change in Indian Music," 133-35. Abstract : The relationship between social change and the development of Indian music raises complex questions, since many things have changed radically over the years. When traditional music was per- formed largely in the courts of local rulers and under the sponsorship of rich landowners, one could presuppose an "elite" audience that understood and appreciated the refinements and basic principles of that music. Today, such knowledge can be assumed to exist only in small groups of music lovers. Dur- ing the early years of colonization the British left a great deal of power in the hands of the local princes. But after the mid- 19th century and the "Indian Mutiny" there was considerable pressure towards West- ernization. N the other hand, the rulers adopted Western culture and sent their children abroad to be educated; native art was neglected (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • Ranganayaki Ayyangar: "Composition in South Indian Music," 136-39. Abstract. Most South Indian concerts begin with a varnam - a composition in parts. The first part is sung to a text and constitutes a kind of introduction without improvisation; the second part, based chiefly on solfeggio syllables, has one line of text that is used as a refrain. It is not necessary to under- stand the text but it is desirable. The varnam can be sung in a single tempo throughout, but generally two tempi, slow and fast, appear in the first part, and a third, "in between" tempo in the second part. In a typical concert, a group of kritis (songs) follows. Here the text is of great importance; South Indian audiences (and musicians) do not generally approve of text mutilation resulting from splitting up words and the like (incl.

The theory can be learned in three weeks by reading and listening and through a study of rãga. The student must then devote three years to technical exercises (not composi- tions) and to learning the different kinds of ornaments.

Abstract : Rhythm is usually thought of in connection with drumming, but in Indian music it involves more - namely, the complete system of tãlãs, which might be loosely defined as a rhythmic frame- work. When music is performed, someone always keeps the tãlã by means of established hand gestures that include clapping, finger counting, and turning up the palm of the hand. At one time there were some 1 28 different tãlãs , but these have later been reduced to 7 main types, each with 5 different variet- ies (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé).

Abstract : The most important musical events in the 20th century were the first congress on Arab music which took place in Cairo in 1932, the second congress held in Baghdad in 1964, followed by the third congress 1969 in Morocco. The Inter-Arab Academy was founded in 1970 in Baghdad. It can be said that great steps have been taken in most of the Arab countries in the field of preserving the musical heritage and furthering the continuity of tradition. Most of the states have also been exposed to other civilizations, to broaden their horizons as much in the field of teaching as in that of musical culture in general. Symphony orchestras have been formed in Cairo, Tunis and Baghdad in order to make the rep- ertoire of Occidental music better known, and it would be valuable if the Western countries would act in the same way in regard to the non-European musics in order to bring the different cultures together to achieve a better mutual understanding (incl.

It is this ornamentation which delays the denouement of the melodic line through the use of an on-the-spot selection by the impro- vising artist from the limitless number of possible motifs and numerous ornamentation processes. To comprehend the varieties of ornamentation found in an Arabian musical improvisation is therefore to comprehend that music itself. In turn, to comprehend Arabian musical improvisations is to understand the structure of an arabesque in sound, and thereby provide a key to understanding all the aesthetic products which contribute to the rich legacy of the Arab peoples (incl.

Moroccan Andalusian music (al- 'ala al-andalusia) is part of one of the longest continuous traditions of art music in the world. As the name implies, the tradition came to Morocco from southern Spain, where Muslim courts flourished for seven centuries in Cordova, Sevilla, and Granada. The be- ginnings of Andalusian music can be traced to the early 9th century A. D., with the arrival of Ziryab, a freed Persian slave, at the court of Abderrahmane II, in Cordova. At that time, it was common practice for Moorish sultans to import musicians from the East. Ziryab, however, founded a conservatory in Cordova, to spread and perpetuate his musical ideas, and from that point, Arabic music in the Western Islamic world began to take an independent direction (incl.

Abstract Between 1904, roughly when wide-scale commercial recording began in Egypt, and 1932 thousands of different Arabic cylinders and 78 rpm discs were released. Before World War I the busi- ness of disc recording in the Arab World was dominated by three major companies. The first was the British Gramophone, which recorded many celebrities such as the Egyptian singer Shaykh Yüsuf al- Manyalãw (d. 1911). The second was the German company Odeon, which recorded the singer and actor Shayk Salãmah HijãzT (d. 1917) and many other pre- World War I Arab artists. The third was the Lebanese Baidaphon. This company conducted business in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, Tu- nisia, and Morocco. The introduction of the L. P. disc around 1948 opened other new avenues for Ara- bian music. Each of the technological mass media influenced Arabian music differently in the course of the 20th century (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé). • Christian Poche: "Zikr and Musicology," 59-73. Abstract Limited in the past strictly to the field of Orientalists or Islamic specialists, musicology has since uncovered and investigated in less than a decade the mystical procedure universally adopted by Islam in the ceremony called zikr. And in this revelation of a musical phenomenon much new light has been thrown on the subject. The zikr is a collective mystical ceremony whose aim is to bring the faithful into union with God; the ceremony is accomplished through the use of various psycho-phys- iological techniques and through the use of recitations, songs and instrumental music (incl.

Increasing the recognition of and respect for one's own traditional music contributes impor- tantly to realizing the aim of revitalizing an Arabian sense of identity. For the spiritual tradition of any nation, its culture, literature and arts are the major elements that form the nation itself. It is tradition which continues to be a basic element in holding a nation together, and in case of a physical loss of home, it is tradition which characterizes the national identity of any people. This matter is becoming clearer to many Arabs in their contemporary history, especially to those who, through occupation by forces of other cultures experienced the dangers of losing national identity. As a reaction to occupation, many Arabs clung more and more closely to the traditional arts, literature, myths, songs, music and even clothing, in order to stress their national identity. And we must not consider this as an act hostile to the arts and culture of the foreign occupiers; it is merely an emphasizing of one's own identity (incl.

But the same geo-political conditions which thus favored this unity of civilization also presented a factor of diversity to the extent that the ethnics introduced by conquests or determined by environment preserved, for some of them, their specific, individual patrimony up to this day. And if the geographic division applied sometimes arbitrarily in the colonial period did not basically modify this double- facet of cultural unity-diversity of historic Syria, it has nevertheless accentuated the differentiation of the musical heritage to the point that people have come to speak of "Syrian" and "Lebanese" music as if it were a matter of two artistic expressions ut- terly foreign to each other (incl.

For the great majority of the Arabian masses who are consumers of the technical media, which have played a dominating role in their culture for half a century, a piece can scarcely be considered as music if it does not evoke verses of poetry or unless it restricts itself to a refrain between two couplets. Music is purely an intermediary, not a work in itself. And, in the heart of a Muslim civilization, which respects other religions only as far as their Books of Revelation are concerned, purely instrumental music may be regarded as a cult without Holy Scripture, a seditious, anti-literary cabala (incl.

Abstract : Arabian culture itself is based on Arabic language, Islam and tradition. Thus, Islamic music in the Arab world belongs to Arabian musical culture and not vice versa. For the empirical definition of Arabian music we may mention the following five characteristics which help in defining the music: (1.) Tonal system with its characteristic intervallic structure of a major whole tone (± 204 Cents), a minor whole tone (± 1 80 Cents), a mean second (± 1 50 Cents), a minor second (± 1 00 Cents) and the augmented second (± 300 Cents). (2.) Rhythmical-temporal structures with their rich formulae (wazn). (3.) Building structural elements of composed and improvised forms, instrumental as well as vocal. (4.) Its instruments: üd, qanun, darabukka, nay, etc. (5.) Social occasions on which music is performed, and thus the categories art, folk, sacred and entertainment music (incl. Zusammenfassung/Resumé).

Abstract : It is well known that more than anywhere else in the Americas, Brazil has preserved a system and practice of essentially African religious beliefs. The ritual of the Nagôs or Kétous and of the Djèd- jés or Gêgês has best maintained its African character. The Gêgê-Nagô culture is the one which, espe- cially in Bahia, has strongly influenced the ritual of other groups or "nations," such as the Congo-Ango- la and the Caboclos (of mixed races). From the musical point of view, the repertoires which accompany the ceremonial ritual of these groups have been considered up to now as belonging to the styles of West African traditional religious music. Although the musical style of candomblé (in Bahia this word is used to denote, in general, most of the Afro-Brazilian cults) may be easily related to the Nagô or Gêge religious music of Dahomey and Nigeria, the Brazilian repertoires, in all probability, have been devised on the spot, for they reveal certain aspects which are foreign to the African tradition. The hypothesis of "African Retention" proposed by the American anthropologist Melville Herskovits and supported by the Brazilians Nina Rodrigues and Arthur Ramos and the Frenchmen Roger Bastide and Pierre Verger, among many others, should be re-examined, at any rate from the musical point of view. • Jean During: "The 'Imaginai' Dimension and Art of Iran," 24-34; (French transi., 35- 44). Abstract Art is the harmonious result of the union of sensible form and the idea or truth. Beauty is the manifestation of truth and truth ( Haqq ) is one of the names of the essence of God, whose innumer- able attributes are ordered in two categories: beauty (Jamal) and majesty ( jalal ), or, in other terms, sweetness and rigorousness; the first being the level of the theophanies. The highest theophany is consequently, for certain mystics that of beauty as the hadis of the Prophet bear witness of: "God is beautiful and He loves beauty," or, again, the supreme mystical experience: "I have contemplated my Lord in the most beautiful of guises." This is amply sufficient to legitimize the esthetic path, as much from the theological and metaphysical point of view as from the point of view of the initiation. There remains, then, the problem of understanding how the relations between the sensible art and the divine are organized and expressed or, to put it differently, what the true symbolic dimension of art really is. It is only after postulating some general principles that it will be possible to envisage the case of music and more especially the music of Iran. • Ernst Emsheimer: "On the Symbolism of the Lapp Magic Drum," 45-53; (French transi., 54-61 . Abstract. The drum magic of the Lapp magicians is a thing of the past. In the 1 7th and 1 8th centuries, the Christian missionaries devoted themselves to ridding the Lapps completely of heathenism. Under the threat of severe penalties drum magic was forbidden, and the Lapps were forced to give over to the authorities their cult implement of ancient heritage. In that time they were burned by the hundreds as being instruments and deceptive tools of the devil. Often, the Lapps sought to keep the drums from be- ing seized by the civil and church authorities in order to make further use of their magic qualities. They hid them in inaccessible places high in the mountains, in rocky ravines or also, as a last sacrifice to the old gods and spirits, in holy cult centers which were not known to the Christian authorities. Thanks to the broadmindedness of a few more reasonable priests and laymen, a limited number of the drums were vol. 19, 1977 (3-4)</page><page sequence="236">254 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) saved from destruction. Gradually, they came to be placed in museums and today represent there the magic-religious artifacts and cultural, historic documents of unique importance. • Trän Van Khê: "Present and Future Preservation and Presentation of Traditional Music and Dance," 62-75; (French Transi., 76-86). Abstract : Some types of music are doomed in the near future because of worldwide political and so- ciological change. Our aim is not to preserve at all cost a music or dance that no longer corresponds to a people's real need of self-expression. However, it is always a good idea to preserve in the archives the relics of an ancient culture, so that they may always serve as a worthwhile source of comparison or even as inspiration for new creative work. In addition to such "passive preservation," renewed efforts must be made for the active preservation of any tradition of such artistic value that it belongs to man- kind's cultural heritage. In such cases, preservation must be strengthened by teaching and presentation. Preservation must not be confused with conservatism and young people should be encouraged not only to study traditional music, but also to create in the traditional style. It is to hoped that the preservation of traditions will remain one of the major concerns of the cultural policies of nations and international organizations. • Kurt Reinhard: "On the Problem of Content and Form in Music," 87-96; (French transi, 97-103). Abstract Quite obviously, tone-painting can evoke definite associations, but, fundamentally, it is a matter of more or less imitating with noises or sound productions environmental happenings on mu- sical instruments, naturally, in a meaningful composition. In the case of program music, one can al- ways, or at least often, confirm that it is completely faithful to its subject, but one seldom or never asks whether this program would have been recognizable as such from the music alone; that is, if the listener did not know the program in advance. In this case, then, the expected effect is, so to speak, "pre-programmed." The fact, in addition, that specific instruments made automatically recognizable the intended functions of music because they always carried out these functions traditionally, is also no proof for the mutual dependency of content and form. • Manuel Dannemann R.: "The Musical Traditions of the Indigenous Peoples of Chili," 104-13; (French transi., 114-20). Abstract : When I use the expression, "the indigenous peoples of Chile," I allude to the ethnic groups of pre-Colombian origins who inhabit the territory of this country today and who have substantially con- served the autochthonous forms of culture and society; they have incorporated these in systems such as those of parentage, of work, of religion or in disarticulated forms - as the last vestiges of the wisdom of peoples of a very ancient culture. In the first as well as the second case, one can find aboriginal Chil- ean musical traditions. We shall thus be able to evaluate them in this article. The ethnic groups which present the characteristics mentioned above are the following: the Andean, Atacamenian, Mapuche, Huilliche and Alacalufe and the people of Easter Island. • Habib Hassan Tourna: "The Fidjri, a Major Vocal Form of the Bahrain Pearl-Divers," 121-27; (French transi., 128-33). Abstract : Fidjri, a musical term for all "sea musics" ( Funun al Bahr) includes a very rich repertoire. Although it is the most original, unique and characteristic musical genre in Bahrain and the pearl-div- er's one par excellence, it is not the only musical genre to be found there. Besides the "sea-musics" one can find other forms, characterized also by their different rhythmic structures: 1 . the saut, a song form heard also in other parts of the Arabian Gulf and reminiscent of the saut of the 7th and 8th centuries of Medina and Mecca. A singer, accompanying himself on the short-necked ü d, is joined by a group of singers and a drummer playing the mirwas, the two-headed small cylindrical drum. 2. The laiwah and tanburah music. The first term indicates the music performed by two surnay (oboe-like instrument) players and a group of different drums, while the second term refers to the music played by a tanburah (lyre) and drums of various shapes. 3. The djirbeh, music for a bagpipe and a group of different drums. 4. The adid, music performed at marriages and healing ceremonies {zar) and performed by an ensem- ble of women. 5. The daqq-il-habb, singing and dancing performed during the harvest. 6. The ardah,</page><page sequence="237">2. Contents and Abstracts • 255 war dance and singing. The fidjri is mainly vocal and it involves dance movements. It is performed only by men, the pearl-divers, and the voices are accompanied by clapping, drumming, small cymbals and empty water jars, the use of which we shall presently explain. • Claude V. Patisca: "Current Trends in Historical Musicology," 134-43; (French transi., 144-52). Abstract. Charles Seeger has been the most eloquent pleader for a unified musicology and for the ap- plication of systematic method developed in the study of non-Western music to contemporary music of the West, not only art music but the total musical scene in all levels of the culture. "The sooner Western music-historians take off their blindness of Europophilism - as practically all other Western historians have done - and go to work upon the history of non- Western music (and their own popular and folk musics, which are now ethnomusicological data) and the ethnomusicologists (hopefully, anthropologi- cal as well as musicological, and some of them non- Westerners) summon the courage to go to work upon the ethnomusicology of the music of the West, dealing with it as a whole - its professional as well as its popular and folk idioms - the better it will be for all concerned." • Yehudi Menuhin: "Music in the Education of Children," 153-59; (French transi., 160- 65). Abstract: Teaching children the diversity of other cultures, encouraging them to look at the uniqueness of cultures, then of individuals, then of their very selves and their particular environment: this is the humane way, this is the enlightened way; this is the contrary way, contrary to all we have been doing. It is a pity that it has taken us so long to realize how dependent we are one upon the other. It is a pity that hitherto we could hate and kill and murder as much as we wanted to, provided we were willing to run the risk of being murdered in our turn, for it did not spell the doom of mankind but today our only salvation lies in understanding each other. It's not the gun, it's the camera; it's not the use of the body for slave labor, as in so many countries still is the case, it is the understanding of the body so that it may fulfill its tasks with elegance and health, lightness, and economy.

Cosenza, Italy: 1977. 187 pp. Articles • Bruno Netti: "On the Question of Universais," 2-7; (French transi., 8-13). Abstract In a certain sense, the history of ethnomusicology is one of tension between the conviction that each culture has its own music, distinct from all others, derived from its own history, value struc- ture, and types of social relationships, and, on the other hand, the search for musical universais. To attempt to define music is to recognize both its diversity and its unity. Even the early scholars in our field were obviously aware of this tension, as when an A.J. Ellis concentrates his work on exhibiting the non-universality of the Western European scale system, and a Hornbostel hypothesizes about the descending tendencies of the melodies of tribal cultures. The tension between the two views of music is exhibited elsewhere in the history of scholarship. The search for a single "origin" of music typi- fied some of the early interest in non- Western musical cultures by Western students, but this search is still very much with us, having moved from psychology and sociology to musicology and then on to linguistics. Attempts to create unified theories that view all musical cultures equally (exhibited for example in the works of Charles Seeger); theoretical and analytical systems that make it possible to deal with a variety of all imaginable musical phenomena (as illustrated by many works of Mieczys- law Kolinski); the flavor of many articles dealing with the anthropology of music in a given specific culture, but yet hypothesizing the extension of theory from this culture to others; all of these events of scholarship indicate that many ethnomusicologists, while spending much of their time studying and emphasizing the variety of musical phenomena in the world, still may have as their ultimate aim the definition of music in terms of those of its characteristics which are universal. • John Blacking: "Can Musical Universais be Heard?," 14-22; (French transi., 23-29). Abstract : There is much research to be done before we can begin to speak if musical universais, or near-universals, or even be assured of the sharing of musical experience within circumscribed regions. The most important musical universal of all, the possibility that man is a musical animal, may be the one that is at present least in evidence, because of a variety of circumstances and taboos that have sup- pressed the innate talents of millions of people. That is what concerns me most, because I believe that music-making is a special activity that has had, and could continue to have, important consequences for the full development of human potential. • Frank Harrison: "Universals in Music: Towards a Methodology of Comparative Research," 30-36; (French transi., 37-42). Abstract : In the light of the discussion, the subject of possible universais in music may logically be resolved into at least six different and related areas: (1) structure; (2) use; (3) function; (4) structure- comprehension; (5) structure-referent perception; and (6) structure-plus-occasion meaning. • Gertrude Prokosch Kurat: "Universals in Dance," 43-52; (French transi., 53-62). Abstract The prime function of dance is transfiguration, identification of the ego with other creatures of the visible and invisible world. Dancers effect transformation by mime of revered animals, of other human beings, of supernaturais. They reach for the spirit world in healing trance or euphoria. They ac- complish their aims by means of the universal tool, the human body, moving according to basic physi- cal principles, in space and time. Thus they manipulate the same tool for all techniques, for traditional, regional folkdances and for ubiquitous modern art dances. • Mantle Hood: "Universal Attributes of Music," 63-69; (French transi., 70-75). vol. 19, 1977(1-2)</page><page sequence="239">2. Contents and Abstracts • 257 Abstract : Suppose we turn to a different kind of universal in music by making the assumption that every culture has some type of vocal music. So far as I am aware this is a generality-end of the spoke that has no exceptions. But another aspect of the generality-end of the spoke might seem to offer dif- ficulty: we cannot assume that every culture has instrumental music. However, simply because a few tribes may not have been supplied by nature with the raw materials from which to fashion musical instruments, we should be taking a too-restricted stance if we were to eliminate all instrumental music, therefore, from consideration in our quest. To be quite sure that my point is clear: let us be content in defining "universais in music" as those attributes of music that approach worldwide distribution. An example comes immediately to mind: some kind of modal practice, consciously preserved or not, is found almost everywhere. In other words, let us accept "universality" in the sense of "high probability of occurrence." • Trän Van Khê: "Is the Pentatonic Universal? A Few Reflections on Pentatonism," 76-84; (French transi., 85-91). Abstract : There is not a sole pentatonic, a sole 5-note scale applicable to any or all traditions but, rather, a large number of pentatonic systems which vary according to ethnic origins, geographic regions and musical traditions. On the common basis of the pentatonic structure of the scale, each people, accord- ing to its own genius, has contributed new elements to enrich the musical language and to give an original note to its own tradition. • Jean-Jacques Nattiez: "Under What Conditions Can One Speak of the Universais of Music?," 92-105; (French transi., 106-16). Abstract It is on the basis of an inventory of rules that one can construct families, and finally determine what they all have in common, but it is also on the basis of hypothetically universal processes that we can seek hie et nunc their manifestation in a particular situation. Non one seems to want to orient musi- cological research exclusively towards the search of universais. If anyone might attempt to, his efforts would be doomed to failure: the relative and the universal cannot be conceived independently of each other, singly. And it is by the daily effort of describing musical phenomena and behaviors in all cultures that one will be able to understand how music is a characteristic trait of the human species and why, next to a "faculty of language," there also exists, inscribed in the biological destiny of mankind, and no less basically, a "faculty of music." • Alan Lomax: "Universals in Song," 117-30; (French transi., 131-41). Abstract : These remarks on the universais of song represent findings from the analysis of 4,000 songs from 400 societies from the main zones of human culture. The study focuses on singing and orchestras only in their accompanying function. Singing, the source and model of music-making, is viewed an act, a kind of behavior, and human song is ultimately a social act, aim and whose result is cultural. Sing- ing is also one kind of vocalizing, the product of the throat and lungs, very closely akin to speech, like crying and laughing and groaning. Like them, its prime purpose is communication. Singing is thus a special sort of vocalizing with a special communicative role to play. Cantometrics takes all singing as its province and examines its whole cultural range in order to see how the properties of singing vary with and thus reflect the differences in other cultural behavior.

Kwabena Nketia: "The Place of Traditional Music and Dance in Contemporary African Society," 5-15. Abstract: The distinction between "traditional" and "non-traditional" has become an important one in many parts of the world undergoing rapid transformation, for there is a growing consciousness of the need for maintaining some balance between modernization or the currents of contemporary culture on the one hand, and on the other, the pre-industrial way of life and the cultural forms that characterize it. In Africa the duality of traditional and non-traditional pervades the whole of social and cultural life. For example there are traditional and non-traditional religions, traditional and non-traditional forms of education, traditional and modern African literature, traditional African music and "contemporary" African music. • P.S. Ofei: "Training of Teachers of Traditional Music," 16-20. Abstract: In a traditional setting the recruitment and training of musicians is a natural process and is always done within the norms of each society. As music is traditionally practiced and absorbed in the community as an integral part of social life, the problem of musical activities in the classroom becom- ing "artificial" and therefore unrelated to experience in the society cannot be overlooked. Attempts are, however, being made to help the student teacher make music "live" in the classroom by encouraging spontaneity, creativeness including improvisation, and fostering the virtues of oral tradition, including the development of good ears and good musical memory. • Laz E. N. Ekwueme: "Towards Preserving and Presenting African Music: A Theory of Notation and Transcription," 20-26. Abstract: Education in the performance of the music by the traditional method as well as in our schools and colleges must be continued or initiated - as the case may be. Dissemination of the music by mass media already plays a significant role in our new societal life. If we add these new methods of preser- vation and presentation to our established oral tradition through the performance of the music as here advocated, we should have no problem in preserving our musical cultural heritage or in presenting the same to others and to posterity. vol. 18, 1976 (4)</page><page sequence="241">2. Contents and Abstracts • 259 • Akin Euba: "Aspects of the Preservation and Presentation of Music in Nigeria," 27^2. Abstract: African music will make little impact on world culture until Africans are able to take control of the media of dissemination. Too much is being beamed in to Africa (particularly from the Western world) and too little is being beamed out in return. In Nigeria, media resources have developed at a considerable pace, but these resources are not fully used to serve music in all its different categories and have so far tended to favor the popular types. The universities have an important role to play in the preservation and presentation of music, particularly in those areas of music which commercial agen- cies, at least for the time being, find unprofitable. To further the promotion of African compositions, the Ife Press is also considering plans to start a periodical catalogue of works by Africans. • Aba Hayford: "Traditional Music and Dance in the Visual Media (TV and Film)," 43^48. Abstract: An expressive art with which film for both the cinema and TV has fused in creating its own syncretic art is music. Dance of course has a very special role to play in film making and in TV produc- tions when required. But the use of music in film and TV has been developed to such an extent that within the total art complex of a film both for the cinema and for TV, music has become a phenomenon that by itself can keep viewers spellbound for split seconds or for longer periods glued to their seats. Music in film, whether traditional or contemporary, is sound that is playing an integral part within the unit of the story or theme of a film. Thus music in film and television has become a specialized field of study and with it, new questions arise that can be resolved only as more films are made with new contexts that require varied usage of music to convey new meanings that can excite new areas of as- sociations in the viewer. • Atta Annan Mensah: "Updating Traditions in Music-Preservative Devices," 49-55. Abstract: Traditional music in Africa is predominantly music of rural communities following specific patterns of life and beliefs, and unless it can be ensured that this rural life, its belief systems and life patterns will remain as they have been, it cannot be certain that there will be continuing active sources to serve as living models of the traditional music we seek to preserve. The pace of life in Africa holds this threat and if this continues, the agencies of promotion and patronage would eventually be working in a sterile atmosphere and would have to seek new goals to justify their operations in this field. Since the preservation of complete life styles lies outside the scope of composers, performers, teachers of music or musicologists, those concerned with music should face this issue from a musical angle and examine additional measures of guarantee for the preservation of African traditional music. • Gustav Oware Twerefoo: "Instructional Materials in Traditional Music for the Classroom," 55-57. Abstract: The failure of music education in schools because of lack of instructional materials does not lie on the traditional musicians but lies on the failure of the music educator to utilize the philosophy backing the teaching techniques of the traditional music teachers. It is also a problem of education, a problem that was inherited from the past colonial rulers. It is a problem for the African to identify himself and to understand his own cultural environment. • M. Opoku: "Presentation of Traditional Music and Dance in the Theatre," 58-67. Abstract: The preservation of traditional music and dance is bound up with presentation. Their pur- pose should be to keep alive in the contemporary man a burning awareness that music and dance are vital to him; and also to encourage creativity, development and further exploration of existing forms in response to social demands. To derive the greatest benefit from such presentations, calls for an effort to acquire as much background knowledge of the way of life of the social, ethnic or institutional unit. This process calls for emotional, intellectual and aesthetic education. It also involves an understanding of the function of music and dance as vehicles for calling groups and institutions together; why and when they are performed and what they mean in terms of communication, response and emotional, intellectual or religious stimulation. • Bulletin of the International Music Council (UNESCO) 4/1976 , p. 1-38 (Supplement in English, German, and French).</page><page sequence="242">260 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) the world of music 18, 1 976 (3) / die welt der musik / le monde de la musique.

Abstract : Les traditions orales des peuples de tous les continents comprennent des récits sur l'origine de la musique ou, plus particulièrement, sur l'origine de genres musicaux et d'instruments de musique spécifiques. D'une façon schématique on peut classer ces récits en trois groupes selon qu'ils attribuent l'origine des instruments au monde surnaturel, au monde animal ou au monde humain. Etant donné le caractère mythique de beaucoup de ces récits - les événements relatés se passent dans un «temps mythique» où les frontières entre êtres surnaturels, animaux et hommes ne sont pas encore définitive- ment tracées. Si certaines sociétés attribuent l'origine de la musique à une divinité et la transmis- sion des instruments de musique (de même que d'autres biens culturels) à un héros civilisateur, pour d'autres sociétés, la musique sous toutes ses formes et avec tous ses instruments est une invention exclusivement humaine. Ailleurs, des récits mentionnant différentes origines, souvent pour un même type d'instrument, coexistent: c'est le cas chez les Sénoufo d'Afrique occidentale. • Abraham A. Schwadron: "Music Education and Non- Western Traditions," 25-30. Abstract : The ultimate general educational goal is an enlightened global awareness; the dividend, hu- manistic empathy. The task of the music educator is to realize the particular uniquenesses of music (in relation to social studies, for example) in meeting this goal through the development of musical percept and concept. (No claims are made here for music education as a solution to sociocultural problems of the economically or minority disadvantaged, the ill-fed, or the politically oppressed, whatever priori- ties can be designated to such matters). • Trän Van Khê: "Un exemple d'enquête et de recherche d'ethnomusicologie en République démocratique du Viêt-Nam," 31-35 (in French only).

Mais les recherches sur les chants populaires ont toujours été effectuées d'après les methodes en usage en ethnomusicologie. II ne nous est pas possible de citer, dans le cadre de ce petit article, toutes les recherches couvrant une grande partie des chants de travail, chants alternés, chants de fête, chants de divertissement, chants de théâtre populaire des peuples Kinh d'origine mongole et des peuples minoritaires du Viet-Nam.

Abstract : The songs and instrumental pieces and dances of the Nawals were powerful and effective in working magic and manipulating the forces of nature and the thoughts of men. So is their music con- sidered to be effective today: the songs for rain bring downpours even during drought, courting songs influence a reluctant miss in favor of her suitor, a shaman's chant casts and breaks spells, calls the spirits of the dead to the service of the singer, defends one against harm from evil spirits. Through the aid of music the wind and rain are controlled, agricultural and human fertility are assured, and illness is cured. At the beginning of life the newborn child is assured of a favorable destiny by the musical offerings made to the sun at this time and through the traditional music the shaman is carried up to the zenith of the sky where he can communicate with the gods in the name of his people. The performance of the old music is a centralizing and unifying event for the Tzutuhils of today, who, like many others, are threatened with the disappearance of the old customs under pressure from the modern, technologi- vol. 18, 1976 (3)</page><page sequence="243">2.

Through its performance they achieve a harmony with the cosmos: the center of the earth is brought into unison with the extremes of space when the acts of living men are one with those of the Nawals at the ends of the earth, and the present moment is united with the primordial cycle of time, the era of the Nawals. • Salah El Mahdi: "Les formes improvisées de la musique arabe," 42-45 (in French only). Abstract : Avec l'extension de la religion musulmane, commencée au Vie siècle, la musique arabe, qui, comme toutes les musiques de l'Orient, était basée sur l'improvisation, n'a cessé de se développer grace aux contacts avec les civilisations les plus proches, celles notamment de la Perse et de Byzance dont les musiques se fondaient sur la tradition orale et plus précisément sur l'improvisation selon des normes précises. A cette époque, une des premières formes de chant improvisé au proche-Orient était adhan ou l'appel à la prière, inauguré par Bilal l'Ethiopien, compagnon du Prophète Mohamed, qui se rendit célèbre par la qualité de sa voix. Cette forme est restée psalmodiée jusqu'à nos jours dans un mode persan appele isbahan. • I Made Bandem: "Barong Dance," 45-52. Abstract : In the early stages of Balinese society the life of the people revolved around nature. The rhythm and rhythmical movements of surrounding nature greatly influenced the rhythm of their lives. This undoubtedly affected their dances, which were devoted mostly to the imitation of natural move- ment, such as that of the waves, trees blown by the wind, movements of animals, and so forth. Such movements are recognizably preserved in the dances today. For example, ngeraja singa is an imitation of a lion wiggling his neck; gelatik nuwut papah is an imitation of the jumping movements of a paddy bird, used when a certain character in the dance picks up an umbrella from each side of the stage; and kidang rebut muring represents a nervous deer pestered by flies.

Abstract : Although Westerners are beginning to acquaint themselves with the traditional music of Ja- pan through gramophone records and the increasingly frequent tours of Europe undertaken by Japanese artists, they still find it difficult to enter into a world of music so different from the one their ears are accustomed to. The questions put to me by the students and the audiences I have had the opportunity of speaking to on this subject show that they try in vain to grasp the characteristics of this form of musical expression by referring to their own system, derived as it is from a concept of aesthetics which has little in common with that of the Japan of olden times. Therefore I think it may be useful to throw some light on the principal aspects of the aesthetic which governs the organization of Japanese traditional music. • Trän Van Kêh: "Some Principles of Aesthetics in the Musical Tradition of Vietnam," 11-16 (French and German transi., 41-43; 57-59). Abstract : It would be difficult to find any writings on aesthetics in the musical tradition of Vietnam. The only works likely to give us some information on this subject are monographs on a particular musi- cal genre, collections of pieces of music, methods teaching the art of singing, and documents in which music-loving literati have only stated generalities. • Alain Daniélou: "Aesthetics and Indian Music," 17-22 (French and German transi., 44^6; 60-62). Abstract. A sense of the beautiful is not included in the Indian theory of the rasa-s (the nine kinds of emotion: love, mirth, pity, anger, courage, fear, disgust, wonder, and tranquility). Because of its com- pletely different approach to the values of form and expression, however, Indian music may be able to contribute elements that will be useful in framing a definition of what aesthetics can be. We are here in the presence of an art in which the pursuit of vocal quality, richness of timbre and fullness of sound appears to be of no interest. This is because the purport of this music is not to sound beautiful but rather to suggest beauty, to shape and to create it. It evokes the splendor of the seasons and of the hours of day and night, the depth of man's feelings and the power of his emotions. It opens for us the door to the heavenly worlds, but it remains like truth that is niranjana, i.e. "unadorned." It is not beautiful in itself. It is not the door of paradise that is beautiful, but what one sees through it. The harmonies of forms, colors and sounds seem beautiful to us only because they call up a higher reality. This leads us on to the problem of understanding whether the concept of aesthetics is not a mental blockage, a refusal to see, behind the form, that state of perfection which a certain harmony may suggest to us and where being, perception and joy (sat-cit-ananda) form an indivisible whole. • John Blacking: "The Value of Musical Experience in Venda Society," 23-28 (French and German transi., 46^9; 63-66). Abstract The heartbeat of Venda is most powerfully represented by the steady, stately beat of the big bass drum ( ngoma ), which is a symbol of ritual power and political unity in the music of tshikona and domba. Tshikona is the Venda national dance. It is the epitome of the beautiful and the valuable in Ven- da music, and few Bavenda are slow to express their appreciation of tshikona. Tshikona, they say, "is the time when people rush to the scene of the dance and leave their pots to boil over;" tshikona "makes sick people feel better, and old men throw away their sticks and dance;" tshikona "brings peace to the countryside."

Abstract. The lama who, during his meditation, enters into contact with higher levels of existence, draws the texts for new ceremonies and sometimes also a new arrangement of the pre-established melodic and rhythmic patterns on which the ritual music is mainly based, from what is called the "heavenly storehouse," which is thought of as an endless reservoir for the representation of forms and considered in its turn only as a creation of the mind. But the world of forms has no intrinsic value, and it is said that the forms themselves are no more real than human beings; it is precisely the most profound and complete recognition of this fact which makes it possible to obtain liberation from the circle of causes and effects, in other words from the cycle of reincarnation. • Habib Hassan Tourna: "Relations between Aesthetics and Improvisation in Arab Music," 33-36 (French and German transi., 51-52; 68-69).

Abstract Is the psychology of music, as we know it today, fully applicable to the study of any and all musical traditions? And, if it is not, as we shall see, what are the prospects for a broadened psychology of music, one that would be compatible with the extreme variety of musical traditions, past and pres- ent, that constitute the world of music? These questions can be sharpened by looking at the parallel development of the psychology of music and Western psychology. • Robert Kaufmann: "The Psychology of Music Making in an African Society: the Shona," 9-14 (French and German transi., 36-39; 50-53). Abstract. In non- Western societies, and particularly in Africa, the tendency towards abstractness is not as prevalent as in the West, and cultural understanding is not a part of our heritage. Hence, the human aspects of music making take on special significance. However, most of the studies on the human un- derstanding of music making in Africa have concentrated on the social rather than the psychological as- pects. We are frequently told about religious rituals, appropriate work activities, textual considerations of music making and the general social system, but we rarely hear about psychological considerations: vol. 18, 1976(1)</page><page sequence="246">264 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) the nature of perception, the relationship of ecstasy and music making, the learning processes in music, or musical personality studies. • Ruby Ornstein Ludwig: " Wayang Wong , the Javanese Classical Theater," 15-22 (French and German transi., 39^1; 54-57). Abstract : Wayang wong is the classical theater of Central Java. It is a court creation - an elaborate, sumptuous, and highly stylized form of "total theater," comprising a narrator, actor-dancers, and a gamelan, or orchestra. It is, however, preeminently a dance drama, and to its audiences a successful performance means splendid dancing. The plots are drawn from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and represent only fragments of these elaborate epics. Whereas the stories differ considerably amongst themselves, most of the scenes in a particular play are drawn from a collection of standard scenes, such as the royal council, the hero with his comic attendants, and various battles. • Marie-Thérèse Dominé-Datta: "Himalaya: The Epics of Kumaon," 23-29 (French and German transi., 42^4; 57-60). Abstract : It is in fact the hurkiya, the shaman, who upholds all the religious, the cosmogonical and the Puranic traditions; it is he who recites the beliefs and the stories associated with the numerous spirits and local deities and retells the history and the legends of Kumaon that have been transmitted by the astonishing memories of generations of hurkiyas. These historical narrations form one cycle which tells of the origin and foundation of the kingdom of the Katyuris and of its history and decline (7th to 14th cent.), and another cycle about the heroes who lived during the Chand dynasty (14th to 1 8th cent.). Although full of miraculous happenings and poetic enthusiasm, these narrations may nevertheless be termed epics because they tell of the exploits of historical personages, even though these exploits are sometimes adventures involving love and magic.

Abstract : A technical problem to which the field should be addressing itself is the idea of music as a process. Our orientation, obviously a convenient one, has been towards music as an artifact. We think of a repertory of music as consisting of a group of pieces, of songs, or genres. But we have paid relatively little attention to the relationship among these components. We know very little about the way in which music is composed, learnt, changed, and transmitted. We think of a musical tradition as consisting essentially of a stable body of sound, and become disturbed when we find that it changes. But we should perhaps take also the opposite point of view, regarding change as the constant and the compositions and performances themselves only as convenient stopping-off points for the artist and the investigator. This is one of the major problems that face us in our intellectual approaches to the field, and it is a problem which probably affects all ethnomusicologists, whether they are working in an isolated tribal group in South America or in the urban centers of India or Japan. • Alain Daniélou: "The Psychology of Improvisation in the Music of North India," 16-22 (French and German transi., 40-42; 55-58). Abstract There is a rhythmic consciousness just as there is a modal consciousness. As soon as an individual identifies himself with a rhythmic structure he finds himself in a sort of closed circle he cannot get out of. Any alteration of the rhythm produces a powerful psychological shock which is frequently utilized in curing diseases. But the kind of rhythm that has such an effect consists of a long period. There is no rhythm of three, four or six beats, such elements being only subdivisions within the rhythmic period. We have much to learn from the rhythmic structures of Indian music and its long phrases which form an absolutely rigid framework within which all the variations, the suspenses and the whims of improvisation are possible, just as they are possible in terms of melody in a rãga, en- abling the artist to express himself and to make a deep impression on the state of soul, the psychology of his audience. • James T. Koetting: "The Effects of Urbanization: The Music of the Kasena People of Ghana," 23-31 (French and German transi., 43-46; 58-61). Abstract : Music plays a vital role in the lives of many people in Ghana. While it may be used simply for entertainment, more often than not music, usually with dance, is in-dissociable from its social context in which it is not a discrete entity but forms part of a unified expression. Hunters, fishermen or farmers may use music in special ceremonies to ensure success in their respective ventures or to celebrate their satisfactory completion. Or music may play a role in the work itself - not so much to entertain as to coordinate the communal labor. It may be used to induce a trance or to call forth a spirit at a cult gath- ering. Certain music may be keyed to or symbolize specific acts in a state ceremony. At birth, puberty, marriage or death ceremonies, particular music may be required which would be performed at no other time. These and similar situations exist throughout Ghana, but, while the social contexts are analogous, the music used in each may, of course, vary greatly from place to place.

Abstract The majority of Noh plays were written in the second half of the 14th century. Two great masters in particular came to the fore: Kannami (1333-1384) and his son Zeami (1363-1443). The lat- ter discarded the popular and realistic style of his father in favor of a more aristocratic refinement, and in doing so he was undoubtedly encouraged by his patron Yoshimitsu, the third head of the Ashikaga government, who was first and foremost a man of politics but also an aesthete and a patron of the arts. It was Zeami who fixed the form of the Noh, and it is important to point out that he was both a creative artist and a theorist. He left a repertoire of over two hundred Noh plays and twenty-one theoretical and aesthetic treatises. After Zeami we may mention Motomasa ( 1 394-1432), Zeami 's son, and Nobumitsu (1435-1516), who added a new dimension to the art by creating plays that were more spectacular and more dramatic. • René Sieffert: "The Literary Sources of the Noh," 13-1 8 (French and German transi., 37-39; 50-53). Abstract : In this "Treatise on the Writing of Noh Plays" ( Nôsaku-sho ), Zeami says that when one wish- es to write a Noh play it is essential to choose a character suited to the execution of singing and danc- ing, "for singing and dancing are the substance of our art." He goes on to list a number of historical or legendary figures: the poets Narihira and Kuronushi, prince Genji, the hero of the famous 1 lth-century novel, the poetesses Ise and Komachi, the courtesans Giô, Ginyô and Shizuka, and the monk-musicians Jinen-Koji, Tôgan-Koji and Seigan-Koji. But he soon adds the following: "One can also write plays in which one introduces unknown characters, men or women, young or old, who are to be presented as possessing an accomplished style in everything concerning dancing and singing. . . One may also write an altogether new play that has no literary source but is associated with a place which is to be extolled, in the manner of the poets, or which was the scene of an event in older times. Such a play may make a good effect on the public, but it can be created only by the genius of an established master." • F. M. Kuamochi: "Interview with the Noh Actor Umewaka Manzaburo," 19-25 (French and German transi., 40^42; 53-56). Abstract : It is hard to say whether the Noh theatre can really be made intelligible. This is chiefly bound up with the problem of language. The texts declaimed in the Noh are in a language that has scarcely anything in common with the spoken and written Japanese of today. And so, as far as the comprehen- sion of the texts is concerned, there is no great difference between a foreign and a Japanese audience. A person, who understands it, understands it; someone who doesn't, doesn't! But I think that we who are at home or abroad, ought to find ways and means of - well, educating the public would be going too far perhaps - but we could say ways and means of creating an understanding. I have heard that an educated European said he had seen the Noh and found it boring. Of course there are also Japanese who find it boring. When we were in Zurich in Switzerland giving performances, a man with his wife, mother and mother-in-law, i.e. four people, came especially from Berlin to see our Noh. On the follow- ing day I saw him in the street; he came over and told us that he had never been so deeply impressed in all his life. Perhaps this experience was due to his particular sensibility. In any case we felt that it had been worth-while and deeply rewarding going abroad to give performances. vol. 17, 1975 (3)</page><page sequence="249">2. Contents and Abstracts • 267 • Carl Wolz: "Dance in the Noh Theatre," 26-32 (French and German transi., 43^5; 56-59). Abstract : The genres of performing arts most often given as sources of noh are kagura, bugaku, saru- gaku, dengaku, ennen, and furyu. From kagura came the ceremony and etiquette of Shintoism includ- ing the carrying of a fan and the use of the instrumental ensemble of flute and drums called hayashi. From bugaku, noh drew one of its basic structural concepts: jo-ha-kyu, or introduction, development, and conclusion. Sarugaku was comprised of a variety of entertainments such as acrobatics, magic tricks, humorous skits, and dances with recitation called kuse-mai. Dengaku, or "field music," began as elements of rice cultivation festivities that were refined into pure entertainments. Dengaku and sarugaku were mutually influential and became similar dramatic forms. Ennen were dances with song performed by Buddhist priests at New Year's banquets. Furyu is described by some as popular songs and dances of the Ashikaga Period, and by others as a ceremonial dramatic form related to Ennen. From these diverse elements, Kannami and Zeami, and others, created a synthesis with stylistic unity that became what we know today as Noh. • Bulletin of the International Music Council (UNESCO) 3/1975 , p. 1 -24 (Supplement in English, German, and French). the world of music 17, 1 975 (2) / die welt der musik / le monde de la musique.

Abstract : The notations do not have a prescriptive character, in other words, they do not precisely indicate all the details of the musical performance and therefore do not form a "text" to be realized, as is the case with the European musical notation. On the contrary, what we have here are notations whose chief function is mnemonic, and this also explains its few descriptive aspects. This essentially mnemonic function is clearly demonstrated in the teaching of music in the monasteries. For example, at the monastery of Nechung, which is now at Dharamsala in North India and whose Superior functioned as the State Oracle, a copy of the musical notations of the repertoire of the long trumpets is given to the novices while they are learning this repertoire. They thus use the notation as an aid to the memory. But once they have learnt the pieces in question the notation is taken away from them and burnt. Only a single copy of the notations is kept as a document belonging to the monastic tradition. At the great monastery of Pepung in ICham, a region in Eastern Tibet, cheironomic techniques based on the musical notation were used for teaching purposes. The master drew signs in the air corresponding to this nota- tion, and the pupils had to interpret them correctly when playing their instruments. • Roderic Knight: "The Jali, Professional Musician of West Africa," 8-13 (French and German transi., 33-35; 48-50). Abstract : The jali š or griot's role as an oral historian and genealogist is exemplified by the several ver- sions of the epic of Sunjata, Mali's first emperor, and other historical narratives that are frequently told by jali-s and have been written down by researchers. Within these epics, and especially in the story of Sunjata, we find many examples of the jalís prominent role as counselor, diplomat, master of ceremo- nies, praiser, and entertainer. It is apparent from all accounts that the jali in these times commanded a high degree of respect. Music provided the vehicle for many of his activities, but instrumental music always took a subordinate role to the voice. vol. 17, 1975 (2)</page><page sequence="250">268 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Habib Hassan Tourna: "Interview with the Iraqi Od Virtuoso Munir Bashir," 14-18 (French and German transi., 36-37; 51-53). Abstract : The problems concerning the preservation of traditional music are innumerable and cannot be solved solely by concert activities. However, I do feel that such activities contribute to the preser- vation of this music. I believe that the problem of preservation is closely tied to that of diffusion. The greater the number of people acquainted with and interested in our traditional music, the greater will be the support received by the expounders of this tradition. The moral and psychological value of such support is of immense importance to an oriental artist, for thus he can see that, in spite of the present- day pressures, which tend to take him away from the practice of traditional music, what he believes in and does accordingly is praised. Such praise, I believe, will encourage other musicians to follow the same path, a fact that may well create a general situation in which traditional music can be more easily preserved than it is today and perhaps can even develop with renewed vigor. • Ming-Yueh Liang: "Neo-Taoist Implications in a Melody for the Chinese Seven-Stringed Zither," 19-28 (French and German transi., 38^12; 53-57). Abstract : Although first embraced by Confucian ideology, the noble simplicity, the discipline and the meditational serenity of the ch 'in lent themselves well to Taoist and Buddhist practices, and some monks and recluses were known for their excellent playing. The ch 'in is an instrument for personal, intimate communication and enjoyment rather than for a large audience. Po Ya was considered a great ch 'in player, and his friend Chung Ch'i a great listener. When Chung Ch'i died Po Ya, in an outburst of grief, broke his ch 'in in two and never played again. The ch 'in is furthermore closely associated with a nature symbolism in which the pine tree, the plum tree in blossom, and the crane play an important part. These birds were said to have a fondness for ch 'in music and could be trained to dance. An anecdote about Shih-kuang, a Chou dynasty music master, tells of how twenty-eight cranes flew towards him when he once started to play the ch 'in. As he continued his performance the birds formed a line, and after playing the third time the birds began to sing. Recording Reviews • Ivan Vandor: "John Levy.

Each of these books contains the texts of several hundred songs, and these are regarded by professional musicians as the main body of classi- cal Burmese music.

Hindu cosmological theory insists on the fact that matter and life arise from an energy which is differentiated according to numeric codes. Only the prime numbers play a part and have a "personal- ity." 1 is not susceptible of form and cannot be multiplied. 2 creates dimension and the possibility of space and time. Two points are needed for the existence of a distance. 3 creates the possibility of the manifestation of energy, of motion, and therefore of matter. 5 makes life, sensation and thought pos- sible. 5 is the number of Shiva, the life principle, whose symbol is the phallus. A close observation of the ratios of numbers is comparatively easy in music, but less direct in spoken language. We may nevertheless assume that the complexes of harmonics which we perceive as vowels, and which have never been analyzed from this point of view, will inevitably reflect the characteristics implied by their expressive value. According to the rule of non-verbal counting, which limits to five the number of ele- ments we can recognize without counting them one by one, a phenomenon which affects all our direct perceptions, all the ratios of the sounds we can analyze, recognize and reproduce are limited to the factors 2, 3, 5 and their multiples. • Ivan Vandor: "The Gandi : A Musical Instrument of Buddhist India Recently Identified in a Tibetan Monastery," 24-27 (French and German transi., 49-50; 70-71). Abstract : The gandi, which the monks of Gyütö Monastery call gendi, although they spell it ga-ndi, is a wooden board, narrower at its central part, which can be made in three different sizes. The length of the different parts, the thickness and the breadth are pre-established. The three versions of the instrument differ only in length and not in thickness or breadth, these being always the same. When measured in accordance with the Tibetan tradition, these lengths correspond respectively to 1 80, 84 and 24 digits, the unit of length being based not on the length but on the breadth of a finger. The longest instrument is used in the big monasteries, the middle-sized one in the smaller monasteries, and the smallest one is used by monks who have withdrawn from the monastery for a more or less extended period of medita- tion. The breadth of the board has to be six digits, the thickness two digits, the breadth of the bevel- edged part also has to be two digits, and the narrow part, which should be cylindrical and has no fixed diameter, has to have a length of twelve digits. The two ends should not be blunt but, as was explained to me, should form a point "rather like the mouth of a frog." The instrument is struck with a kind of wooden beater in the shape of a figure of eight. Its shape resembles the dorje ( rdo-rje ). The signaling and magic function of the gandi has a parallel in the use of the conch-shells. According to tradition its use was introduced by Buddha himself. • Terry Bech: "Nepal: the Gaine Caste of Beggar-Musicians," 28-35 (French and German transi., 51-54; 72-75). Abstract. The Gaine live in rural communities principally in Western Nepal, and their total population is under 3,000. They are part of a traditional Hindu village society where they stand near the bottom rung in terms of economic, ritual, and political status. The Gaine accompany their songs with a bowed short lute of North Indian provenance, the sarangi, and their song-texts contain mythological, histori- cal, or current news references. The origin of the Gaine's creative ability is traced back to the time when the gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Maheswar created the four major Hindu castes in their 36 differ-</page><page sequence="252">270 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) ent forms, but the form of the Gaine caste was difficult to create since none of the eternal sages knew how to sing the celestial music of the Gaine caste. The sages got together and decided to play a trick on the gods with one sage masquerading as a Gaine. The gods called the sage's bluff and in the process told the sage the song he should sing, calling it Avorima, which means the great knowledge of Brahma (ground of the universe), Atman (the individual soul), and creation. The further meaning of Avorima is that there are ten rooms that the Gaine assumes to constitute man. Five of the rooms house the intellect and cognition; the other five rooms house the organs and senses. Only when all ten rooms are open does the Gaine believe himself to be able to write, see, hear, walk, move around, sing and laugh. The Adam's apple is the owner of the doors to these rooms.

Each and every one of them bears wit- ness to an intimate connection between music (the actual substance of the music as well as the means used to articulate it, i.e. the human voice and the instruments), speech, and function, to which should be added another element that is almost always inseparable from the preceding ones, namely that of bodily expression, or dancing. If one of these factors were omitted the meaning of the whole would be lost, and one would be left with something incomplete, insignificant (in the proper sense of the word), dreary and boring. "Music?"; Sacred?" In most of the languages of Central Africa there are no semantic equivalents of these two concepts. Music marks out the major events in a way of life that is infinitely meaningful, and accordingly we could speak of "functional music," but without attaching any deroga- tory implications to the expression because the music is indeed much more than this, it is music as an agent. In the domain we have been considering here, music is seen to be both a pre-eminent means of communication and the communication itself, on which man relies in order to remain in contact with the supernatural forces. vol. 16, 1974 (4)</page><page sequence="253">2. Contents and Abstracts • 271 • Alain Daniélou: "Religious Music in the Countries of the Orient," 20-35 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract. At all levels ranging from elementary magic practices right up to the highest summit of mystical experience, music plays a fundamental and essential part in the discovery of the supernatural world and in the ritual observances of all religions. The sense of hearing is the most abstract of all our senses, the sense through which we perceive elementary relationships between vibrations analogous to those which give birth to the world. According to Hindu cosmology, the manifestation of the Universe proceeds from a primordial sound ( nada ), which is regarded as the first vibration to be set in motion in the ether. It is by sound, by the Word, that the divine thought becomes rhythm, then matter, then life, and it is through knowledge of sounds that we are able to comprehend the basic structures of matter and thought. Many of the techniques of yoga aim at discovering the path from the vital rhythms back towards this fundamental harmony, towards this primordial sound through which the creator manifests himself in the created. In all religions we find this notion of the word as creator, of the stage represented by a form of vibration which lies between conception (thought) and realization (the perceptible world). This first expression of the desire to create is not God, but it represents the ultimate point where man can come near to knowledge and experience of the divine. Reports , 36^3; Information , 44-50.

Abstract : As the present article is concerned with some aspects of Spanish music, the present con- tinuation of which is termed contemporary, it automatically becomes necessary to go into details that are less well-known, but without aiming at a comprehensive presentation which would require a vo- luminous tome. We should not forget that the first third of this century had just come to an end when Collet and Salazar published their investigations, while today we are at the beginning of the last third. Disregarding the significant contributions on the subject that have been made during the recent past, there is only one book that has been written in the meantime which commands our attention in that it combines a critical approach with comprehensive references to the general cultural background, and can therefore be regarded as a major achievement. I refer to Federico Sopeña's Historia de la música española contempornea , which was published in 1958. vol. 16, 1974 (3)</page><page sequence="254">272 • the world of music 53 , 2011 (1-3) • Juan Orrego-Salas: "Today's Latin-American Composers and Their Problems," 22-29 35 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The sudden revival of interest in folklore which took place in the Latin-American countries in the early twenties led necessarily to an anti-folklore movement as well. This movement was sup- ported by all those forces which saw in folklore an attack on the form and content of art music, the essence of which had nothing in common with the indigenous traditions of the New World. This kind of internationalist awareness, however, did not gain in scope and importance until the beginning of the second half of this century. Both in this and in the immediately preceding period the Latin-American composer was continually faced with the necessity of questioning his own identity. • Tomas Marco: "Traditionalism in Contemporary Spanish Music," 30^47 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract After a whole century of steady decline (this being a fair description of the 19th century), Spanish music gave birth to a third tradition, which is still in force today and is regarded by some as the only possible one, namely the national school. Based on the theories of Felipe Pedrell and the pio- neering works of composers like Pablo Sarasate, the national Spanish school developed by drawing on the resources of popular songs and rhythms, but not simply in order to adapt them to the structures of art music but to transform them. Subsequently there arose a number of composers capable of writ- ing works which had not been equaled in greatness and content since the 16th century: Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, Joaquín Turina and above all Manuel de Falla. It is advisable to make a careful assessment of the nationalism of this period, for in the meantime it has become a stronghold of conser- vatism and an obstruction to progress in Spanish music. At the time, however, the new music came as a bombshell to the indifferent and hostile cultural environment. Reports , 54; Information , 55-60. Book Reviews • Habib Hassan Tourna: "Salah el Mahdi.

Abstract : Music therapy works on the reaction that music provokes in mind, body and emotions. As a form of non-verbal communication music affects man at different levels: as a sensuous non-intellectual experience usually produced by the color of the sounds (or timbre); as an emotional experience through psychological musical elements such as relaxation, intensity, silence, anticipation, repetition and oth- ers; as an intellectual experience of form and structure which gives meaning to the communication and makes it memorable. These three aspects of a musical experience may culminate in a spiritual or aesthetic experience related to the personality and the needs of the listener or of the performer. I believe that my own experience as a performer has given me a deep insight into the understanding of communi- cation through music and of the analysis of the therapeutic processes involved. These processes begin with the emergence of a sound. In my case this sound is produced on a cello string which vibrates. • Edith Lecourt: "The Psycho-Musical Techniques," 17-33 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : During the period of World War II a certain amount of "experimental" research was done, chiefly in the USA, on the unique power exerted by music on people, and over the past ten years or so the countries of Europe have also joined the endeavors to objectify the intuitions and empirical prac- tices of music therapy. We now find ourselves confronted with a vast subject which has bearings on teaching, art, medicine and psychology and therefore arouses an interest, and even an enthusiasm, in regard to an undertaking which can be pursued only by a team made up of representatives of the vari- ous disciplines concerned. In France, under the term "techniques psycho-musicales," research has been developed into the various applications of music, such as music therapy in the proper sense of the term (carried out in the framework of psychiatric treatment), forms of expression that can be associated with music (pictorial, physical or verbal expression), and psycho-musical relaxation, the latter being some- times the first step toward anesthesia (as applied in stomatology, surgery and gynecology). We should also mention the problem of psycho-prophylaxis, which music is particularly well suited to deal with. • Jack Bornoff: "Music, Musicians, and Communication: An Interview with Luciano Berio with the Participation of Vittorio Ottolenghi," 34-51 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : As a musician, I (Luciano Berio) do not believe in promoting music in general as a com- modity, but rather in promoting ideas about music. And there are as many ideas about music as there are social and cultural situations. The Italian situation is different from the French, or the French from the German, etc. Analyzing the road to success requires different instruments in different countries.... Saint-Saëns in France was more "successful" than Schönberg. Richard Strauss in Germany was more successful than Mahler, Webern and Berg in Vienna and Bartok in Hungary and in the United States. Puccini and Mascagni in Italy were more successful than Debussy. But the fact is that the idea of suc- cess has little to do with the measure and content of the "successful" work itself. This is why I feel a certain resistance in accepting unquestionably the word success: it is typical of our mass-media age. There are many different types of success as there are many different ways of approaching music. Within the frame of mind of the mass-media, success means the composer who sells most records, whose photo appears most frequently in the newspapers. But, ideas about music can represent most vividly a cultural process in a subtle, one might say ironically in a "silent" way. Reports, 52-57; Information , 58-67.

Editors: John Evarts and Christian Poche; Assistant Editor: Wilfried Sczepan. B. Schott's Söhne. Mainz 1974. 81 pp. Articles • John Evarts and Christian Poche: "Foreword," 3-5 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : This issue is devoted to the Days of Non-European Music, the third of its kind, organized by the IICMSD and held in the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, from the 1st to the 12th of October, 1973. The purpose of this event was to enable a European audience to make direct contact with another musical culture and so to comprehend a different outlook on life which is usually communicated to the European only in the form of a pale reflection, and also to give a number of talented artists an op- portunity of obtaining recognition at home and abroad. Rudolf Heinemann, who was in charge of the organization, was careful to select soloists and ensembles of which the majority were making their first appearance not only in the West but also on the platform of a concert hall: the Shomyo, a ceremony of the Japanese Shingon sect involving the recitation of Buddhist sutras and hymns; the Korean Court Orchestra presenting the a-ak repertoire of ritual music for the ancestors; an ensemble of Ghanaian drummers; the Indian soloist Lakshmi Shankar (voice) and Ram Narayan ( sarangi ); the Syrian Kurdish musician Mohammed Ali Tedjo ( tanbura ) and Said Youssef ( busoq ); and the famous Iraqi üd player Munir Bashir. • Alain Daniélou: "Days of Non-European Music in West Berlin," 7-14 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract In the countries concerned, which are often called the "underdeveloped countries," the gov- ernments have been traumatized by the attitude of Westerners to their "traditional culture," a term which can easily be taken to signify backwardness and a lack of adaptation to the modern world. They therefore make great efforts to put themselves on an equal footing with the "developed countries" and are inclined to see in the encouragement given to their own traditions a disguised colonialism designed to keep them in their "Middle Ages" so as to be in a better position to exploit them. The current dis- tinction between "traditional music" and "contemporary music" clearly implies this discrimination since contemporary music is thought of only in its western form. The term "folklore," which is used indiscriminately - especially in the Soviet Union - for all art music differing from that of the West, af- fords a pretext for compulsory harmonization and puerile transcriptions of the most beautiful forms of music handed down by oral tradition which destroy their whole value but are nevertheless proclaimed as a mark of progress. • Wolfgang Bürde: "Non-European Music: Reflections of a Critic," 15-27 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The abundance of musical forms, of ways of making music, and of types of expression which at first appear strange and exotic, is received today with a sense of anticipation that is all the stronger owing to the disappointments and frustrations which both the connoisseur and the amateur feel in re- gard to the normal run of concerts in Europe. The frequently cited division of contemporary musical life into pop music and avant-garde music on the one side and traditional music on the other, is so well- vol. 16, 1974(1)</page><page sequence="257">2. Contents and Abstracts • 275 known a phenomenon that it is matched in point of notoriety by the products of this division, which always give us a nasty surprise by being so dreary, boring or simply absurd. European musical life is in a very difficult stage of transition to new forms of music and new forms of concert which may one day answer the musical needs of the people better than the traditional ones. If the new outlook on life of the young generation succeeds in humanizing the life of the working man, in gradually getting rid of the opposition between life at the factory and leisure activities in a sensible way, in making work an integral part of life and in giving life a new function in terms of a meaningful process incorporating work and reflection, then music too will cease to be a pure leisure activity. • Habib Hassab Tourna: "The Arabian Musician Today," 28-37 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Munir Bashir was virtually unknown until 1954 when he toured several countries in the Near East. In 1961 he decided to continue his training and went to Budapest to study "music." His teachers were Kodály, Farkas and Szabolcsi. After his return to the East he was called "The Emir of the Od." He made several gramophone records, played at the Baalbek Festival, and then performed on several occasions in Europe and America. He now holds the position of Consultant on Musical Matters at the Ministry of Information in his native city of Baghdad. Reports , 38^3; Information , 44-52.

A deep-seated superiority complex still prevails, and it comes to light again and again in the writings of specialists. In a recent issue of an international musical journal the following passage appeared: "The Western period of tonality clearly surpasses all other musical cultures by the mere fact of being the only musical culture which has raised music to the rank of an au- tonomous art." Apart from the fact that the idol which is here being worshipped, namely "autonomous art," originated in the 1 9th century and therefore may not have been so worthy of veneration in other ages, in other words, apart from this uncritically accepted axiom, the author seems unable to imagine that a great Arabian wcZ-lutanist, an eminent Persian singer, a first-rate Indian sitar player or a fine Japa- nese koto player can create genuine art. • Dale A. Craig: "Whither Chinese Traditional Music?," 21^40 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The Music Department at Chung Chi College in the Chinese University of Hong Kong has pioneered in creating a regular discipline of Asian and Chinese music alongside the established pro- gram in Western music. Students in the Department are required to take several Chinese music courses and may even concentrate on this area of study if they wish. The Hong Kong Archives of Chinese Music, housed in the University's new Music Centre, contains a large collection of scores, books, journals, disc and tape recordings, films, musical instruments, and electronic equipment for transferal and playback of recordings. Now that most prerecorded materials in Hong Kong have been secured, the Archives staff will expand its activities in 1973-1974 to include field work. The research projects in which the staff of the Archives - the author, Cheung Sai-Bung, and Tong Kin-Woon - are engaged at present are ( 1 ) developing a comprehensive method for transcribing ch 'in tablature into staff nota- tion; (2) tracing connections between T'ang Dynasty music and Togaku; (3) collecting into one volume teaching pieces for ch 'in; and (4) a general study of Peking Opera. There are a number of outstanding scholars devoting their energies to clarifying some of the many questions with which this field abounds and bringing new music to light to replenish the diminishing repertoire. Two who have done remark- able work recently are Rulan Chao Pian of Harvard University and Laurence Picken of Cambridge University, but there are many others, including Martin Gimm in Cologne, Shigeo Kishibe in Japan, and Yang In-Liu of Peking.

Contents and Abstracts • 277 Articles • Alain Daniélou: "Non-European Music and World Culture," 3-20 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The appreciation of the forms of a new musical language presents a significant psychological phenomenon. The possibilities of expression of the various systems are very different from one an- other; they appeal to other regions of our sensibility and cause other cerebral mechanisms to intervene. These mechanisms correspond to kinds of mental compartments that are separated from one another. The same is true for languages. When we open the compartment that speaks French, it should not communicate with those that speak English and German. If there is a leak from one compartment to another our phrases become muddled. For music, we must create a new compartment for each musical language. Until this has been done we shall not understand the meaning of what we hear or judge ac- cording to the standards of our own language. • Mubin Sheppard: "Ma yong - The Malay Dance Drama," 21-33 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : When Peter Floris, the English traveler, visited Patani in 1612 he was invited to attend a banquet given by the Malay Queen of Patani in honor of the visit of the Sultan of Pahang. The Queen later entertained her guests with singing and dancing and with what Floris described as a "commedye," in which, he took the trouble to mention, all the performers were women. He added that they were dressed in strange costumes and that the play was "very pleasant to behold." This is, 1 believe, the ear- liest record of a performance of the Malay dance drama called "Ma'yong." It must have been a well- established form of Malay court entertainment in 1612, and it continued to be the favorite diversion of Malay rulers and nobles in Patani, Kelantan, and Kedah until the beginning of the 20th century. • Akin Euba: "Evaluation and Propagation of African Traditional Music," 34-51 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : As African societies become more and more technological. African traditional music may become less utilitarian and increasingly contemplative. It is also likely, however, that the new music will not necessarily replace the music we now regard as traditional, and that both forms will coexist. Because it is ethnic in nature, the enjoyment of African music has hitherto been intra-ethnic. The time has now come for all its treasures to be shared. This can be done by taking full advantage of modern communication techniques which, mostly developed in Western countries, should be suitably adapted to fit African circumstances.

French and German transi.). Abstract : Compared with the new music theatre of the early years of this century, that which came after the Second World War may be said to have gone through a rather barren period. This applies equally to all Western European countries, not to mention those of Eastern Europe. The Fascism of the thir- ties and forties halted the formation of any progressive development not only in Germany, Spain and Italy but in all other countries as well. It forced all the leading composers, performers and teachers to emigrate, and in their struggle to earn a living they often had to let their artistic ambitions take second place. What they left behind was a scene of desolation. America outstripped Europe, although the op- portunities then available in the New World were far more limited than those which Europe could have offered. All the same, what could then be done was done in the United States. As late as 1958 Germany still had to import gramophone records of works by Schönberg, Berg and Webern, to mention only a few composers. • Hans W. Heinsheimer: "Opera in the USA Today," 16-28 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Operatic life in the USA, as it has developed during the short span of time since the last world war, reflects the most exciting, interesting and far-reaching cultural revolution that has happened here since, after the first war, the symphony orchestra became the musical, cultural and social vogue in America. • Boris Yarustovsky: "Aspects of Operatic Theatre in the USSR," 29^4 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : While striving to discover new things, the majority of Soviet opera composers do not neglect tradition, for they know that it is only that which has been worn down by stereotyped usage that be- comes antiquated, that it is the cliché devoid of aesthetic life that becomes banal. In art there is noth- ing "contemporary" and nothing "museum-like," although some short-sighted critics would have us believe that this is the case. In art there is only that which is alive and that which is dead; that which is being renewed and is stable, and that which is transient and changeable. An opera will not be a contem- porary opera simply by virtue of the fact that its plot is based on a play by Beckett or Ionesco or that the electronic and stereophonic effects are functioning well in the auditorium. The composer cannot afford not to take into account the influence on society of his operatic composition against the background of contemporary life. But in order to do this he needs subjects which stir his contemporaries, he must em- ploy genres, modes of thought, feeling and vocal intonation which, when raised to a high aesthetic level worthy of the professional, as of course they must be, speak directly to a modern audience. In regard to the aesthetics of opera, the works of Soviet composers have much in common with those of composers in the other socialist countries, where a flourishing activity is also going on in the field of opera.

Abstract : In the West silence is a negative concept, an embarrassment to be avoided. In some oriental philosophies, indeed in Christian mysticism, silence is a positive and felicitous state in itself. I would like to regain that state in order that a few sounds could intrude on it and be heard with pristine bril- liance. In our classes we have been trying to employ some yogic relaxing exercises as a preparation to the listening and creating experience. Little by little the muscles and the mind are relaxed to a point where the whole body becomes an ear. This may take some hours but at the conclusion, students have told me, they have heard music as never before. . . • Michel Philippot: "Reflections of a Composition Teacher and Radio Man," 2 1 - 35(incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The problems of musical composition which seemed very important to us when we were in our early twenties are now completely out of date. To realize this is to be taught a good lesson in modesty. The young people of today have their own problems which are quite different to those we had when we were young, and this helps us to become aware of a certain relativity. Also, by keeping in contact with young people we acquire a better understanding of the problems they are faced with and the things which inspire them, and this enables us to take a fresher and more youthful approach to our own problems. • Gardner Read: "Self-indulgent Notational Aberrations," 36-49 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Music notation is the symbolic language of musical thought. It is the visible manifestation of the various elements that comprise organized musical expression - a specific act of direction by the composer giving tangible form to the interrelated properties of music we designate as pitch, duration, tempo, intensity, and timbre. In other words, notation is the detailed guide by which the creator in- structs the performer in what to play or sing, when, and in what manner. As a written language notation depends upon visual symbols to define aural phenomena, just as an alphabet serves as the functional basis for both spoken and written word. vol. 15, 1973 (1)</page><page sequence="262">280 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Reports , 50-64; Information , 65-71.

It is difficult for them to assert themselves in the prevailing repertoire, but it is even more dif- ficult for them to obtain a second performance after the premiere. It is self-evident that, unlike the other professional groups, they cannot earn a living by the work they do. The composers have therefore no reason to be content with the present-day musical life of Western Europe.

Here we come to what is, in a sense, the fundamental difficulty of American musical life: the system of private patronage. In sharp contrast to most European countries, the USA has only just begun, in the last few years, to accept the idea of public subsidy for the arts. The stumbling-block has always been the fear that government sup- port for artistic activity would bring government interference with it. Concomitant with this has been the private patrons' unwillingness to let control of the character of artistic presentations out of their hands. Understandably enough, private patrons will only pay the piper if they are allowed to call the tune, and it is this factor that has maintained the conservative stranglehold on programming in so many musical centers, and has restricted artistically admirable ensembles to the social function of mere toys for the rich and privileged few. • Yuri Korev: "USSR: Achieving Lenin's Ideas in Music," 32-47 (incl.

Contents and Abstracts • 281 Abstract : There is one of Lenin's thoughts which should be borne in mind, namely that the chief task of the new society is to make everything accessible to everyone, the whole wealth of culture and art created by mankind during the course of their existence. It is this very idea which underlies our state cultural program. It was formulated and adopted at the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party held in the memorable year of 1919, in the heat of civil war, of the struggle against the attempted in- tervention of the Entente powers. • Akimishi Takeda: "Japan: Shõmyõ or Schubert," 48-57 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The closed world of "Western music," which arose as a center particularly in Europe in the 1 9th century and, as viewed by some people, continued to occupy this position into the first half of the 20th century, is in my opinion on the decline. As far as the non-European observer can judge, this means that with the spread of "Western music" to all parts of the earth this center has lost its absolute authority and cohesive force. But this does not mean that the collapse of this closed world implies the rise of a "world music." The peoples of the world have all preserved their own specific traditional cultures and attitudes to music, and when Western music, like a mighty torrent, flooded the other civi- lizations, very different forms of "encounter" or "collision" took place according to the characteristic properties of the respective culture.

His position in the musical hierarchy; his function, ideal and actual; his qualifications, or the lack of them - all have come under close scrutiny, not only by the creators and purveyors of music, but by the critics themselves. Stravin- sky dismissed the entire profession under the label of "reviewer," or the more contemptuous epithet, Brother Criticus. He did, however, hark back to some undefined golden age: "Some people have earned the right (to write criticism) by knowledge and skill, but they are not the present - and yesterday's present, and, in fact, the perennial - crop of reviewers."

Abstract : There is not only one type of music criticism, but a great variety of widely differing types. There are no established standards or criteria that could tell us what it is and what it is not. Music criticism ranges from musicological analysis, which is more at home in specialized journals, to the most highly subjective opinion telling us how a particular critic has experienced the piece of music in question. This type of literary activity is precariously situated on the border line between scientific and literary writing, and there are many factors which may determine the particular bias of the individual author. To write about music is difficult enough, but to translate it into the language of concepts is sheer impossible. If we speak the meta-language of musicological terminology we enter the domain of scientific analysis, which in the usual sense of the word has nothing to do with criticism. A study of music and musicology does prepare the critic for his profession, equip him with the knowledge he needs, develop his taste and enable him to compare styles of composition and performance, but in addition to this the critic must possess a good all-round knowledge of cultural matters in general, of philosophy, and sociology. • Fred K. Prieberg: "The Critic is Superfluous Today," 39-52 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract'. The distinguished American music critic Winthrop Sargeant, who writes for "The New York- er" and is one of the last masters of musical criticism in the old style, recently bade farewell to his readers. Before embarking on that stretch of retirement which commonly results in the publication of "revealing" memoirs, he gave the public a last sample of the art of saying unpleasant and unpalatable things "with elegance." Sargeant's statement is cast in a tone that combines sarcasm with melancholy: "Music criticism is a parasitic occupation. If you live, like Bernard Shaw, at a time when you can intro- duce a Wagner to your readers, you can become a great critic. But if you cannot crusade for a contem- porary composer, I don't think you can get much out of music criticism. Reports , Information , 53-68 (incl. French and German transi.).

Abstract : How can we maintain the varied musical styles, mostly non-urban, which help to make this planet an agreeable place to live? Musicians, particularly those with administrative functions, can ef- fectively oppose the contemporary gray-out of cultures. If this gray-out continues unchecked, it will wipe out man's principal achievement - his varied life styles and communication systems - and will impose upon our world one or several standardized cultures. One can already sense the oppressive dull- ness and the psychic distress of those areas where centralized music industries, exploiting the star sys- tem and controlling the communication system, have put the local musician out of work and silenced folk song, tribal ritual, local popular festivities and regional culture. It is ironic to note that during this century when folklorists and musicologists were studying the varied traditions of the peoples of the earth, their rate of disappearance accelerated. • Alain Daniélou: "Craftsmanship and Industry," 18-30 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : If we wish to avoid losing the precious heritage, the immense variety of sound techniques which the countries of the Orient have preserved for us, we must approach them with respect and reconsider our methods. For, the difficulties of explaining the structures and content of the musical languages of the Orient with the use of the terminology of European musicology, the nonsense result- ing from the various systems of notation which have been used, and which are as inadequate for the essentially fluid musical forms as the systems which people have attempted to create to notate dance movements, the imprecision caused by the introduction of Western solfège in notating the music of the Orient - all of this has only brought about a general misunderstanding and disastrous results. This fact should lead us to revise our methods and to study the diverse forms of musical language, beginning with its interior essence, with the meaning of the music and not with arbitrary "facts" defined in terms of a musicological science which is interested only in the external aspects as seen through the perspec- tive of a particular culture. • Narayana Menon: "India's Place among Music Cultures," 31^49 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The Indian tradition has to be understood in the context of Indian life and thought. Its present theory and practice are the logical development of a consistent process, a process which has been dis- tinctive and which is an integral part of Indian history and culture. To listen to Indian music and judge it in terms of Western music or some other system will mean missing the point and reaching absurd conclusions. It will be like judging Beethoven or Brahms or Tchaikovsky in terms of rãga (the basis of Indian melody) and tãla (the basis of Indian rhythm). Questions of style, of interpretation, of finer and subtler points of execution cannot be discussed in any recognizable international terms. Aesthetics and attitudes can. Music is not an international language. All this talk of music being an international language is a facile over-simplification. Of course it is true of areas like Europe or Southern India or Northern India or West Asia - areas which have a common musical system but different spoken lan- guages. But I have heard a great deal of Egyptian, Javanese, Japanese, Persian, Arabic, Indonesian, Chinese music - not to mention the various national styles of Europe - and I doubt if these constitute an international language.

Abstract : Latin America, or rather Ibero-America, is something less than a continent and something more than a culture. The process of its discovery has still not been completed. Communications are often unreliable. Its self-confidence has been shaken. Its idea of the outside world is characterized by self-alienation. Its own world is largely influenced by magic. The notions entertained in other countries about Latin America are usually distorted and erroneous. In spite of this, its music is also appreciated in other parts of the world, even music (from Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Panama) that could be regarded as exhibiting a predominantly European influence. • Hans-Peter Reinecke: "Mass Media and Musical Culture," 30^45 (incl.

Abstract : If we take a careful look at the various statements that have been made about the so-called mass media and their effects on music, we find that at least three general, basic attitudes can be distin- guished. The first is largely negative, the second is more or less neutral, and the third reflects a greater or lesser degree of euphoria, or at least a good measure of optimism. Those in favor of total rejection complain about the cheapening effect produced by the mass consumption of electric transmission and reproduction media and habitually interpret this development as being due to an undisguised profit- making policy on the part of the industries concerned.

Abstract : In the United States music education in television has too often become characterized by an instructor teaching children to sing, by performers discussing and demonstrating musical instruments, or by a university professor talking about musical literature. I believe that music education in television should and does consist of much more than this. In fact, I seriously question the so-called educational values of such programs. The entire concept should encompass a wider age range and a greater variety of music and approaches. Since I believe in the broadest possible definition of music education in tele- vision, I will speak in general of music in television. • Manfred Grater: "The Future of Music Lies in TV," 20-31 (incl.

Manfred Grater (Head of the Music Department of the 3rd TV Programme, Cologne): If anything in the way of a decline in musical life is setting in anywhere, then it is certainly not due to the mass media, i.e. television, the wireless and the gramophone record, but rather to the awful standard of the performances given by provincial opera companies and orches- tras. • Hansjörg Pauli: "Music - Heard and Seen," 7&gt;2-Al (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The question as to how music ought to be presented on television is brought up at more or less regular intervals and discussed with sustained enthusiasm, not to say fervor, by the few whom it concerns. It is always brought up whenever a national broadcasting corporation or a major production group declares its intention to "set a new trend" in music, and those who discuss it, i. e. the producers, a few tireless critics and on rare occasions the viewers, base what they have to say on the assumption that it is desirable for music to be given a place on television. I wish to begin my reflections on the subject of the TV concert by querying this very assumption: why, when all is said and done, should music be broadcast on television? For, to put it bluntly, television is becoming more important and music less important all the time. Reports , Information , 48-60 (incl. French and German transi.).

French and German transi.). Abstract : To examine the connections between music and dance in the Orient and Africa is to raise anew the problem of their reciprocal meaning. In cultures that are vitalized by a continual communi- cation with the masses, music and dancing usher the individual into an existence in which, for some hours, he partakes of the riches of the community. Art gives birth here to a new man, a sacred man dif- ferent to the being who has been secularized by everyday life. Music comes into the process only as a generator of rhythms. From Japan to the Congo, rhythm is the soul of the dance. In Bali, for example, the music produced by an impressive array of unusual instruments represents merely a colorful and ornamental epiphenomenon. Furthermore, the exotic choreographers know how to adapt the rhythmic technique and expression to the physical make-up of the respective ethnic group. • Brigitte Schiffer: "Debussy &amp; Räga - Grieg &amp; Tãla," 18-25 (incl.

Abstract : In the encounter between East and West it is that new parameters of time and concepts are now involved, and what has happened is that not only the Beatles, Hippies and pop artists, but also Cage, Stockhausen and indeed the young generation in the West as a whole are deriving inspiration from Eastern tuition and wisdom. It will suffice to remark in passing that many of them once sat at Ravi Shankar's feet in order to be initiated by the guru into the secrets of Indian music and musical practice. And Ravi Shankar, the undisputed master, virtuoso and artist, has now written a "Concerto for Sitar and Orchestra" for the London Symphony Orchestra. • Fivos Anoyanakis: "Heritage of Antiquity in Greek Music Today," 26-41 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The oldest folk-music instruments in use today, that is, those which are associated with modern Greek folk melodies and dances, also have their origins in Byzantium and ancient Greece. The pear-shaped, three-stringed bowed lyre (the rebec portrayed in Gothic cathedrals such as Chartres, Canterbury, etc.) that is played in Northern Greece and on many of the islands was already known in Byzantium in the 9th century. It is mentioned for the first time in an oration addressed to the Caliph Al-Mu'tamid (870-893) by the musical theorist Ibn Khordadhbeh. According to recent musicological research, on some islands where the inhabitants have remained particularly faithful to tradition, the tuning of the lyre is the same as that of the antique lyre during the pre-classical and classical periods. The pipiza , a kind of archaic oboe with a very high and penetrating sound which, with the daouli (big drum), forms the typical instrumental ensemble heard at village fairs and festivities, is in fact the an- cient aulos , for which, as the classical writers tell us, the cane growing on the borders of Lake Copais furnished the best double reeds. Until 1931, when the lake was drained, pipiza players used to cut the cane on its banks to make the double reeds which were considered to be the most durable and to give the best tone. The instruments of the lute family, such as the lute itself and the tambouras (also known as bouzouki or baglamas), which are so widely used today by folk musicians, were also known in the vol. 13, 1971 (3)</page><page sequence="269">2.

French and German transi.). Abstract : When considering the situation of music in our time we should begin by asking ourselves whether the conventional method of musical education helps to develop or is more likely to suppress the natural musical talents of the students. When I started music lessons at the age of 7 or 8, 1 was im- mediately confronted with written music. I had to learn to read music before I came into contact with music itself. The common result of this method is that children play mechanically what they read, without grasping it, and when they are requested to sing what they have played, they are unable to do so because they have been taught to read notes and not to make music. • Grigory Schneerson (USSR): "Aims of the Moscow IMC Congress," 50-54 (incl.

Thorough consideration will also be given to questions concern- ing the development of musical culture in non-European countries, in countries which have recently thrown off the yoke of colonialism and are now entering the family of independent nations. As is well known, many countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America possess a high and ancient national musical culture. Before them a path is now emerging toward the creation of a many-faceted professional art that will reflect the essence of their age, their progressive humanist ideas. We know of the existence in the West of various points of view concerning the problem of the interrelations between the cultures of European countries and those of the "developing world."

Abstract Twenty years ago the FIM representatives were able to point out that owing to the increasing use of records and other recording devices the musicians who were rich in any case were becoming richer still through their activities on behalf of the record industry, and that the poor musicians were becoming even poorer because they were losing their jobs due to the utilization of gramophone records. In every country all that remains nowadays are the small groups of recording musicians who earn very well indeed, and the larger groups who do not make any recordings but earn a good living all the same. Exceptions apart, the so-called poor musicians have withdrawn from the profession. This situation in particular has not made it any easier for young people to choose the profession of a performing musi- cian. Anyone who would give honest advice to the father of a young musical enthusiast is bound to explain to him that his son will only have a chance of making an adequate living if he develops his abilities through hard work and endurance to the point of reaching an above-average standard on his instrument. There is no place for mediocrity in the musical profession. • Igor B. Maslowski: "Modern Music - A Deficit Undertaking for the Record Industry," 33^3 (incl. French and German transi.).

What general manager would not like to be told that his company is courageous, that it is working in the interests of culture. It is in fact from this point of view that one should, in some cases, look upon avantgardě releases, and if such a release succeeds in awakening an interest in music among young people who have previously been fans of the variety show alone, the company will have achieved one of its declared aims.

French and German transi.). Abstract : The relationship between music and technology has always been a close one, and down to the late eighteenth century musicians in Europe were well aware of this fact. The same cannot be said of the following generations, which henceforth were increasingly imbued by Rousseau's idea of a "natu- ral" music. I would be digressing far beyond the limits of this article if I were to attempt to give even an idea of the strangely tortuous paths which have led to the prevailing Western concept of music; this concept is a mixture of ideas which - anchored more dogmatically than logically - might be briefly characterized by the view that, on the one hand, music is of natural origin and therefore generally and directly comprehensible, and that it cannot distance itself from this very origin with impunity; on the other hand, that music possesses a higher value, the more labor a composer has invested in his works. It is only a step from this to the concept that natural is the same as "good," and invested labor the same as "moral." This step has been taken, and has made Western aesthetics the curious motley of dogma and nonsense that still largely determines our current opinions about music. The mechanical bowing, plucking and striking of strings and skins is not more beautiful, but better - because closer to nature - than the electronically produced sound. • Josef Tal: "Music, Hieroglyphics, and Technical Lingo," 18-28 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Over the last 25 years or so composers of electronic music have developed, as a byproduct, a musicographical activity which right from the beginning placed theory before practice. Because of this no truly creative relation between empiricism and theory has so far ever really come about. The result is that new hypotheses are continually being put forward, mostly in the form of ideological declarations. The fact that the instruments of electronic music breathe the spirit of measuring technology has given pride of place to number as an operator in the discussion on today's music. This has led to a curious sentimentality which stands precisely in inverse proportion to the meaning of number. This time a cor- rection of objective errors is of no avail, for the error lies much deeper, namely in the domain of the misunderstood concept of "technology" We live in a technological age and therefore feel ourselves, as creative musicians, urged to account for our work in technological terms. Technology, however, was originally an artifice; only later was it narrowed down so as to serve only a useful purpose. Technology is far more than a practical means of carrying out a process. In the words of Max Eyth: "Technology is everything that gives human will a bodily form." • Jon H. Appleton: "Electronic Music and the Composer's Future," 29^10 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The proliferation of musical styles during the past quarter-century has forced traditionally oriented composers, performers, theorists and musicologists to re-examine the relevance of their own work. The listener has not been troubled by the availability of new musical experiences; he has no ob- ligation to assimilate the totality of his musical culture. This relaxed approach to musical development which allows him to sample at will results, more often than not, in acceptance and understanding of new musical ideas. Musicians are not allowed the luxury of such casual acquaintance and usually feel impelled to form an immediate opinion, a state of affairs which has resulted in a rejection of new musi- cal ideas even before they can be communicated to the wider public audience. On the other hand, the musician who fears making any critical assessment leaves listeners who may seek guidance without vol. 13, 1971 (1)</page><page sequence="272">290 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) any critical standards. We are constantly confronted with the "chaos" occurring in the arts today, but it is absurd to sense this as a threat within our own culture. This "chaos" can be ordered by re-evaluating our own relation to the artistic products of our society. A revolution has not occurred in the arts as much as it has in our own attitudes. In this period of change we should feel elation at the approach of a new order of civilization. Information , 41-52 (incl. French and German transi.).

In the Gramophone, Sir Comp- ton MacKenzie was utterly gloomy, and the London Times said it was quite premature. In the U. S., CBS went it alone and was followed a year or two later by Decca/London in Europe. I don't suppose it was easy for either management to make the decision; but, once made, it literally changed the face of the record. Artistically, technically, and physically it was a different product, one that would have to be packaged, promoted, and marketed in a different way.

French and German transi.). Abstract : Since the introduction of television and owing to its continually increasing popularity, people in many countries have been worrying about the fate of radio and its place in the communication com- plex. We read reports from various quarters which inform us that this or that broadcasting institution has adopted a revision of the structure of its programs. While some people advocate a conversion of the centrally directed stations, which are in most cases state-controlled and therefore broadcast to the whole country, into regional stations in order to achieve greater diversity, in other countries, especially those in which commercial broadcasting exists, insistent demands are made to give each station a spe- cific image that could satisfy the expectations of a particular group of listeners. Considerations of the kind which are being entertained in England, France, Germany, Australia, Japan and Italy are inspired by credulity toward statistics which has its origin in the U. S.A. and is guided solely by the wishes of the public. These superficial data are scarcely concerned at all with the actual attitudes of the public, i.e. one takes into account the switching on of a receiver but not the patterns of behavior when listen- ing, in other words, the question "how does one listen to the radio?" • David Armstrong: "The Harassed TV Composer," 37^4 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract. The most usual reason producers have for commissioning "specially written" music for a television play or documentary is because they hope to sell the production overseas. For a production which won't be seen outside of the home market they generally have recourse to the record library, where they can always find something that will more or less fit the mood needed. This course would probably be followed for all productions but for the fact that, when it comes to overseas sales, the use of records generally presents a lot of difficulties in the shape of "mechanical" rights; so, if worldwide distribution is envisaged, the producer usually considers it less complicated to have special music writ- ten and recorded, thereby vesting control of the mechanical rights in the organization he serves. This, in itself, is a sad commentary on the position of the composer in our society. Perhaps one day those who control television expenditure will realize that there is a world of difference between music which more or less fits the mood, and music which is designed to fit exactly and aid the "digestion" of the production.

Mediocrity leans on it, talent brings it up to date, and genius recreates it. But inescapably continuity is the essence of the idea. And there's the rub: countries with long histories will have evolved musical traditions to go with them, but where does a country like Australia get it from? And what will its source be? • Jean-Claude Eloy: "Improvisation: Refuge, Utopia or Necessity?," 6-21 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : It appears that in modern Western music the notion of improvisation has of late been evoked more often than that (only yesterday so widespread!) of chance or aleatorism. But is this a genuine change of notion, a tangible conceptual mutation, or is it not rather the new disguise borrowed by the same phenomenon, culminating in the substitution of one terminology by another without, however, altering its meaning? • Habib Hassan Tourna: " Maqãm , a Form of Improvisation," 22-31 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The maqãm represents a unique improvisatory process in the art music of a large part of the world. Geographically this region includes the countries of North Africa, the Near East and Central Asia, in other words a territory which for more than a thousand years has been dominated and influ- enced by the Arabs and their culture. In this vast area three principal spheres of musical culture can be distinguished, namely the Turkish, the Persian and the Arabian, in which the maqãm is widely cultivat- ed. In Turkey this musical form is called makam , in Azerbaijan mugam , in Uzbekistan shash-maqom , in Iran dastgãh , and in the Arab world maqãm. This phenomenon can surely be most aptly illustrated and determined by a description of its latent structural elements, the underlying principle of which is common to the three musical cultures mentioned above. • Massimo Mila and Fred K. Prieberg: "Bartók - Webern: 25 Years Later," 32^8 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The first years, even the first months after the war were for music a time of enthusiasm, sur- prises and - wonders. Although it seemed as if the war had brought everything to a standstill, music had continued to live in the dark. New forces had matured. The musical world had fallen into a neo- classical sleep on that sinister evening, the autumn of 1939, and after a night that lasted five years had an expressionistic awakening on the uncertain and hopeful dawn which was the spring of 1945. Every- thing had changed in the world of music, also in the village "between Denges and Denezy" to which a soldier comes "home" on "fourteen days' leave." Music itself, or more exactly the acoustic reality, the world of sounds and noises, had been enriched by the war with new and frightening phenomena of which the composers were reminded.

Abstract : I know too that the sound of the downward sweep on the sitar' s sympathetic strings at the start of a North Indian recital brings tears of excitement and anticipation to my eyes, as did the sound of the orchestra tuning up on the platform when I was a boy; that I am enraptured now just as regularly (and perhaps in rather the same way) by eastern music as I was then by western: By the tunes, the rhythm, the textures, the shapes, or the age-old, proven philosophy (necessarily filtered by Westerners) behind it all? I still can't tell, so I suppose I am just as far as ever from understanding. But love...? That's another matter. • Anon.: "Stockhausen's Plea for Intuition - An Interview," 6-12 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Question: The definition of what we have so far called music requires a new formulation, especially with regard to your own music. Do you agree? Stockhausen: Most certainly. At the Music Academy I was still taught that one spoke of music as a rational product, but hardly ever of its intuitive sources. It is true that one spoke, with averted glance, about intuition, but no one ever really knew what was meant. So it was that my practical training in all musical disciplines remained completely rational. The same applies to the procedures that I employed during the first ten years of my own compositional activity. I was continually aware of the thought processes in the domain of musical elements. I pon- dered again and again on the supraconscious. From work to work I have tried to make decisions that do not follow any general musical logic. A change then became evident in the first pieces in which I created space and time for those who play intuitively at the moment of performance: Space and time, wherein the intuitive, not only the rationalizable, takes place. This has nothing to do with irrationality or romanticism, or with stages of the unconscious. What is meant is that, in the moment of composing and playing, thought is placed in an entirely new way in the service of a higher inspiration. • Alain Daniélou: "Magic and Pop Music," 13-18 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract We would be inclined, for instance, to think that the music of the zikr practiced by the Ira- nian dervishes is only a repetitive and primitive form of rhythm and melody. Nevertheless it is in this climate that the remarkable and exquisite Persian mystical poetry has flourished, probably the most profound, the most refined and the richest poetry that has ever existed. Against this context the music which today serves as a "background" to the Hippie world should not be underestimated; it represents the faltering articulation of the first real musical revolution since the Italian "Camerata." I am con- vinced that the funeral march that concludes the musical "Hair" already represents one of the very important creations in contemporary musical art: The return to music which is emotionally conceived vol. 12, 1970 (2)</page><page sequence="276">294 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) and susceptible to associations with magic, the meaning of which we have lost, except in certain folk- lore forms, since the Dionysian age, is a sign of a profound revolution which will have repercussions in many domains apart from that of music. • Lubomir Doruzka: "Protest through Popular Music," 19-31 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The new protesting minority sub-culture established itself in the middle of the fifties as rock and roll. To recognize its power and viability was even more difficult than such recognition at the time of the advent of jazz. First of all, it appeared at a time when the pop music business machine was far more developed. This, immediately, was put to the service of the new music so that it appeared to be merely a new fashion manipulated from above. Second, the roots of this music were city adaptations of the original rural folk music, often bearing considerable traces of commercial distortions. This, for many musicologists, completely deprived it of any authenticity. And third, it brought a new kind of musical-physiological appeal, differing not only from European Art music, but also from the relatively established criteria of jazz, so that its musical values and possibilities took some time to be recognized. The first impact of the new wave had the character of a generation manifesto against all generally ac- cepted criteria and conventions. • Tim Souster: "Rock, Beat, Pop - Avantgarde," 32^3 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract In addition to the normal recording technique of the artificial balancing of disparate ele- ments, there became incorporated the multiple super-imposition of tracks, extreme filtering, backward tapes and the exploitation of the spatial effects made available by stereophony. Continuing the devel- opment of these innovations, Jimi Hendrix in his LP "Electric Ladyland" has produced some of the most sophisticated, travaillé and, indeed, resourceful pop on record. His musicality has empowered him to achieve an amazingly successful blend of his distinctively passionate vocal and instrumental style with radical instrumental and electronic noise-improvisation passages very reminiscent of the AMM improvisation group. "The inclusiveness of rock," writes Berio, "is connected with the absence of a predetermined structure." This is not strictly true. An enormous proportion of conventional pop records retain the predetermined structures popular songs have always had. Even otherwise extreme groups like the Who never diverge from the music-hall norm in their simple verse-refrain songs. More experimental groups such as Cream, the Grateful Dead, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Nice are still dependent on blues form insofar as they show a tendency, even after long improvisatory flights, to pay lip-service to a peroratory restatement of the theme. In this kind of pop one often feels a tension, an inner contradiction between the music's electric momentum and the restraining formal influence of its historical antecedents. • Hans Emsheimer: "Splendor and Misery of the American Musical," 44-57 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The American musical, on and off Broadway, is alive, and looks forward, lives in the present time, and the only thing it lacks, strangely, is music. If one remembers the old musicals or the Viennese operettas of the good old days, one immediately recalls one, two, half a dozen melodies from them which obtained immortality as Evergreens long after the musical or the film which was made from it had disappeared. Music was the source of their life. Chambermaids will forever sing "Dein ist mein ganzes Herz" even if they have never seen, heard, or heard of "The Land of Smiles." To realize all this, one has only to look at the statistics which appear in the American theatrical press. In the days of "The Sound of Music," "West Side Story" or "My Fair Lady," one always found the original cast albums as number 1 on the best-seller list for weeks, sometimes for months, after which they began to slide down and then, perhaps a year or so later, disappeared. But by this time they had been replaced on the list by other music from musicals. Today, among the fifty titles in such a list, one finds, at best, one that comes from a musical, and this one is usually very near the bottom. Everything else consists of sound tracks from pictures, albums of the Beatles, the Doors, the Rolling Stones and dozens of other rock and folk groups, and similar material.</page><page sequence="277">2.

French and German transi.). Abstract : Whither Opera? As always, opera's crisis highlights music's, because the story of opera is in many ways the history of music's ability to communicate. Not only, unlike most concert music, has opera to sustain an evening's program on its own, but it has throughout its history had special over- tones: high cost of production and consequent necessity to stand up for several performances; an extra- musical role in social life; the fact that it is a musical form, but judged for survival by the aptness of that music to convey drama. • Lucían Grigorovici: "Socialist Politmusic - Viewed Sociologically," 6-17 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract'. The term "politmusic" was presumably invented and persistently propagated before adequate scientific information on it existed. For decades musicology and sociology were limited to the ascer- tainment of facts and the application of insufficiently tested theories for purposes of technology and prognostication, and the fact that the so-called "social transparency," the clarity of social processes, did not really exist was overlooked. One took, as it were, the line of least resistance: one investigated the superficial appearance only and was content with facts and materials - the Viennese sociologist Leo- pold Rosenmayr aptly spoke of "the occasional call for a few figures." The relation between music and society, which is the most important factor in contemporary artistic activity, was thus ignored. Such a vacuum in research offers an ideal hunting-ground for seemingly scientific speculations on the part of methodical, rigidly directed regimes where, understandably enough, the gap can be filled according to choice. Thus it was, for instance, that at the international seminar on Marxist musical research held in 1 963 in Prague, Boris Assafyev's unfinished theory of "musical shape" was interpreted as a general sci- entific justification for attacks on the moderns, while the old dodecaphony and the newest avantgardě were mixed together into a curious brew labelled "western European decadence." vol. 12, 1970(1)</page><page sequence="278">296 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) • Konrad Boehmer: "Revolution of Music," 19-33 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract'. That day-to-day politics cannot be reflected in music but that music at the most can serve it as a propaganda medium follows from the abstractness of its sound-shapes which, as a vehicle of expres- sion, nonetheless reflect forms of human consciousness, and these forms are part of the overall social condition. The development of social structures in the industrial era has, however, paralyzed the effect of the expressive means on the general consciousness, either through completely subjecting it to the market or through the pushing back of the art-forms that insisted on emancipation into a kind of ghetto of isolation. That society is not capable of understanding the emancipation of the means of artistic expression as models of concrete emancipation but allows itself to be duped by those who demagogi- cally talk of an alienation of modern music, is not due simply to lack of education but is precisely an expression of alienation. And this is the only thing that has caught hold of society in its totality. Not exempt from this is music, the revolution of which during the last sixty years is only a critical reflec- tion of the alienation process, but not an attempt at its concrete abolishment. Musical progress, parallel to social progress, also has its specific dialectic that excludes any commonplace linearity and often has to put up with regression. • Paul Collaer: "African Music," 34-45 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : It is now possible to ascertain the existence of musical zones that correspond in general to the zones established on the basis of linguistic data: a south African zone (Zulus, Swazi, Hottentots, Bushmen); a so-called "Atlantic" zone which in fact extends from Guinea to Mozambique; an eastern zone between the region of the Great Lakes and the Indian Ocean; and lastly a Sudanese zone situated between the Sahara and the Atlantic zone. Without going into detail, we should mention that the Su- danese zone is characterized by the persistence of Bantu musical forms, often mixed with features of an Islamic origin. Here one finds harps and lyres which have their origin in the ancient Mediterranean culture. Widely practiced here are the ceremonial music of the royal courts and the praise-songs of the "griots." The religious ceremonies are performed according to an elaborate ritual in which the music is organized in cycles, the completion of which takes several weeks, or even several years. One also finds here very elaborate forms, notably concertante genres for a sung part, an obligato instrument and a basso ostinato. The Atlantic zone, which is purely Bantu with the exception of the pockets inhabited by Pygmies in the equatorial forest, is characterized in the west by the predominance of the responsorial and antiphonal style and by choral singing in parallel thirds. The central basin, extending from Lake Leopold II to Lake Tanganyika, is the home of a highly developed and very refined polyphony which reaches the level of 12th-century European organum. Bourdons, parallel fourths, contrary motion, free and imitative polyphony are employed here. Among the Ekonda there are musico-choreographic societies which compete with one another in inventiveness and perfection of execution at annual con- tests. Mention should also be made of the splendid institution of the "palavers" in which, in a highly dramatic style, the soloists alternate with the choirs, spoken words with singing, and rhythmically spo- ken choral sections with those that are sung: an institution that reminds one to no small extent of the chorus in Greek tragedy. Polyrhythm, which has been adopted by modern European art, is normal in this Atlantic zone, and cases of instrumental bitonality are also encountered here. In the north-eastern part there are regions where the orchestral performance is based on the principles of the "Klangfarben- Melodik." The proto-Bantus entered central Africa via the eastern part of western Africa. They came from the south, from the zone in which Zulus and Swazi today practice a very archaic music that is still little known. To conclude this brief and very schematic outline, we should add that the Pygmies and the Bushmen practice a very distinctive, non-imitational vocal polyphony in which each voice sings different melodic patterns of different lengths and in different templ.

If they elect to embrace new ideas in artistic policy, no matter how radical and avant-garde, they may stir up new excitement and develop new followers, but will these suffice to sustain an orchestra?

French and German transi.). Abstract : In the past few years several articles have appeared in this review that concern one of the great cultural problems of this century: the East- West relationship. Of course the points of view differ markedly, some, such as the following, being too sure of themselves: "The music of Asia and India is to be admired because it has reached a stage of perfection, and it is this perfection that interests me. But otherwise the music is dead" (Pierre Boulez, the world of music 2/1967). Others betray a somewhat disillusioned misunderstanding of western values: "Apart from the virtuosi who only play, there are composers who only write, a public that only listens, conductors who only conduct, and when under these conditions an artistic impression is created, it is only through a highly organized adjustment be- tween the isolated spheres (Edith Gerson-Kiwi, the world of music 4/1 968). I shall take a different point of departure. In fact the decline of the majority of traditional musics is largely due to extra-musical reasons. It is not a lack of inner vitality, but rather the inadaptability of musicians and the musical life to the sociological changes of today that constitutes the essence of the problem in the Orient. Moreover, this problem is not restricted to the Orient; western music is equally threatened by extra-musical forces that are in part even analogous. Thus instead of contrasting the West with the East, it would be more relevant to determine points in common and therefore to seek ways of resolving the problem, which finally reduces itself to the relation between music short and simple on the one hand, and modern so- ciety on the other hand. • Jacques Brunet: " Nang Sbek , Danced Shadow Theatre of Cambodia," 19-37 (incl. French and German transi.). vol. 11, 1969 (4)</page><page sequence="280">298 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : The shadow theatre is a specifically Asian art. From Turkey to Indonesia, from Karagöz to the Wayang , the various forms taken by moving shadows in the Orient have always enjoyed the favor of the people. It appears that the shadow theatre, like the puppet, originated in ancient India, whence it probably spread with the expansion of Indian civilization, particularly towards the Far East where the shadow theatre came to occupy a very important place in entertainments. Cambodia, Hinduized during the first centuries of our era, rapidly assimilated Indian culture, its crafts as well as its thought. Khmer civilization evolved from a mixture of the foreign and the local culture and culminated in an original synthesis. Thus it is that the sacred dance, although its principle came from India, adopted over the centuries a purely local significance and style. This most vigorous culture was subsequently transmitted, when the Khmer Empire was at its zenith, to Thailand and to Laos. The birth, elaboration and later expansion of the Cambodian shadow theatre probably followed this course. The Cambodian name of the spectacle, Robam Nang Sbek Thorn , signifies "dance of the large hide figure" and not "shadow theatre." The Nang Sbek, together with the Royal Ballet belongs to the great classical tradi- tion of Cambodian theatre. • Sunil Kothari: "The Chhau Dances," 38-55 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The unique feature of the East Indian Saraikella chhau dance is the use of masks. We do not find any parallel dance form in other parts of India. The masks have changed the entire concept of dance. The mask needs no apology in the realm of histrionics, and those used by the Saraikella artists are exquisitely fashioned. By means of their peculiar lines and colors they help to evoke in the spec- tator the mood ( bhava ) and aesthetic sentiment (rasa) aimed at by the dancer. These masks are the work of men skilled in the art - princes themselves are often among them - who have learned from their fathers. Because of this feature the chhau dance has naturally developed along special lines, for, while the employment of masks leaves room for head ( sirobhed) and neck movements ( grivabhed ), it eliminates glances (&lt; dristibhed) as a mode of expression. It is also important to note that, since a mask conceals the identity of the dancer from the audience, neither personal beauty nor sex determines the choice of the exponent of a particular dance form, and skill thus becomes the only element that counts. However, chhau follows the basic principles of Hindu dance, itself the possessor of a specialized tech- nique inspired by its own ideals and concepts. If Shiva is the cosmic actor and dancer (Nataraj), then the whole universe is "nothing but his gestures and postures." And though dance is thus associated with worship, it is utterly devoid of prudery and is charged with a frank acceptance of all that is lovely in nature, man and woman.

Abstract : I think that nothing that parents, teachers or anyone else of the older generation can do will keep young people away from the popular musical forms of their time. But I am firmly convinced that we have an obligation to try hard to expose our youngsters to the broad spectrum of creative achieve- ment. I think that students on a college campus will hear pop music whether it is brought in for an an- nual concert series or not. They may not hear great music and fine performers live, and if they don't, some at least may not be led to riches of experience and sensibility that would influence and enlarge the rest of their days. • Hidekazu Yoshida: "Housing Japan's Avantgarde," 6-16 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The "Institute for Twentieth-Century Music" was founded early in 1957 by the four compos- ers Minao Shibata, Yoshiro Irino, Toshiro Mayuzumi and Makoto Moroi, the conductor Tadashi Mori and the violinist Ryutaro Iwabuchi. Upon their request I took over the direction of the Institute. Already in pre-war years it was usual in Japan for composers to form groups, and a branch of the ISCM had existed for some time. But the war years from 1937 to 1945 and the total defeat that came at the end had put the artists in difficult straights, both economically and socially. Because of Japan's continued isolation the composers had also lost contact with the developments in modern music in the rest of the world. Only in the fifties were the Japanese again able to travel abroad. Thus Mayuzumi went to study in Paris, while Moroi impatiently waited to complete his training in Japanese conservatoires and then immediately set out for Europe. I myself was able to go on a one-year traveling scholarship to Europe and America. Despite many differences we all shared an experience of decisive significance: Japan was even more isolated than we had imagined. The so-called new music of Japan sounded old in Europe. Schaeffer's "musique concrète," for instance, caused Mayuzumi such a shock that he immediately left the Paris conservatoire and returned to Japan to experiment in this field. Irino and Shibata, who during the training had belonged to the German oriented school composition, were the first to write twelve- note music in Japan. • Bernard Jacobson: "Centers Promoting New Music in the USA," 17-31 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The United States is bursting with music festivals. More than a hundred of them are listed in the annual directory published by the magazine "Musical America," and new ones spring up every year in all parts of the country. The popularity of these festivals is partly due to the climate: in most areas the summer is long and hot. Anyone can spend a good deal of it in the countryside. Concert-going in the open air, or at least in air-conditioned halls away from the main centers of population, replaces atten- dance at the urban auditoriums, which are used only during the cooler months. Thus it is that, whereas European music festivals attract visitors to the big cities, American festivals usually take people away from them. Largely because it is what their audiences want, most of the festivals concentrate on music of the classical and romantic periods. A few, however, have assumed the responsibility of making a constructive contribution to the cause of the contemporary composer, and it is the purpose of this article to give an outline of the way three of these exploratory enterprises run. Just as the biggest concentration of festivals in general is to be found in New York State and the neighboring states of New England, so two of these three unusual festivals belong to the New England region: one is the Congregation of the Arts at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire; the other is the Berkshire Festival at vol. 11, 1969 (3)</page><page sequence="282">300 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Tanglewood in Massachusetts. The third festival we shall consider is the Aspen Music Festival in the mountainous western state of Colorado. • Brigitte Schiffer: "Darmstadt, Citadel of the Avantgarde," 32-44 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : When in 1946 Wolfgang Steinecke, modest, friendly and obstinate, asked the civic authori- ties of starving and bombed-out Darmstadt for premises to hold musical holiday courses and accommo- date the participants, with the aim of giving young people art instead of bread, the whole venture had a tinge of craziness. The enthusiastic participation, however, proved that the idea answered an urgent need. But that Darmstadt would one day become synonymous with the musical avantgardě, with exper- imentation and indeed with eccentricity, was neither planned nor could be foreseen, since at that time it was chiefly a question of catching up on what had been neglected and of orientating a young genera- tion, which had grown up in ignorance and isolation, on the musical events not only of the last thirteen, but of the last thirty years, since music written between the wars was also prohibited in Germany. To the highlights of the first Darmstadt Holiday Courses must be reckoned above all a lecture by Robert Mayer and Wilhelm Meyer-Eppler; here, in 1950, examples of electronic music were presented for the first time. Among the listeners was Edgar Varèse who had come to Darmstadt as a teacher, and whose "Ionisation," composed in 1 93 1 for 42 percussion instruments, must in retrospect "count as a daring advance into the sound-world of electronic music," as Wolfgang Steinecke said. This "sound-world" was the subject of a series of lectures, and there came the historic moment when one heard for the first time sounds that had indeed been produced by electronic means. Varèse found here confirmation of all that had been in his mind. Like a man possessed he proceeded to realize his dreams using the newly discovered media that had been demonstrated in Darmstadt.

French and German transi.). Abstract : Nearly everywhere one turns today in the world of music one hears lamentations and jeremi- ads. Concert managers in the USA complain that audiences are dwindling. Audiences that patronize the established institutions like the Metropolitan Opera or the leading orchestras protest when even a modest attempt is made to modernize the repertory. Audiences that throng amphitheaters and stadia to hear the latest sensations in the field of rock music dismiss with scorn the preoccupations of those who remain loyal to the old masters. Composers who stick to old forms and styles deride the experiments of the innovators who compose directly through the computer, while the innovators speak of the conser- vatives as if they were already in the grave. While the war between the proponents of the old and the new is as recurrent as the seasons, it is being waged; it seems to me, with more fury than ever before. Nor is this surprising. There is ample reason for bitterness and desperation on both sides. The truth is that the old institutions are in trouble - and the new ones seeking their place in the sun are having all sorts of trouble finding it. • Henry-Louis de La Grange: "Mahler Today," 6-17 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : In our epoch of rediscoveries and revaluations, Gustav Mahler's personality and works take on a radically new significance. His cult, absurdly coupled with Bruckner's, has long been upheld by a small group of admirers. The subsequent two-headed Bruckner - Mahler monster thus became the au- thor of two times nine indigestible symphonies. A victim of its Germanic megalomania, this legendary creature struck fear into the hearts of most music-lovers and therefore made few and brief appearances in concert halls. Not until Mahler's centenary in 1960 was there any sign of a change, but nowadays cycles of his symphonies are performed, in particular in England and in the USA. But who could have foreseen that Mahler would become a "popular" composer? When he died, the usually realistic Richard Strauss proved over-optimistic when he wrote to Hofmannsthal: "Mahler is dead! Now, even in Vi- enna, he will be considered a great man." In fact it was only in 1967 that a cycle of Mahler's complete works was given in the Austrian capital. Even then, this was organized by the Konzerthaus, not the Philharmonic, whose members have remained faithful to an age-old tradition of security and comfort and hated Mahler when he was their conductor. In London and New York such cycles are now given almost every year. The first complete recording of the nine symphonies, conducted by Leonard Bern- stein, has been issued in the USA, and several others have been announced, under Leinsdorf (RCA), Solti (Decca), Kubelik (DGG) and Haitink (Philips). • Gunnar Bucht: "Scandinavia - A Musical Unity?," 18-31 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Scandinavian unity is more apparent to non-Scandinavians than to those living in that region of the world. Some geographical and historical facts may illustrate which point of view is the more realistic. About 20 million people live in the five countries of Scandinavia where Sweden and Iceland are the extremes with 8 million and 200.000 people respectively. In former days the sparse population, in combination with the big areas, contributed to the weakening of the unity based on a more or less common language (except Finnish) and literary tradition (Icelandic sagas), and until the beginning of the 19th century Scandinavia was divided into two blocs with Denmark and Sweden as centers of power. This historical cleavage has left traces right up to the present time, and this can easily be ob- served in the foreign policy of the different countries. Since the middle of the last century, however, there has existed a current towards Scandinavian cooperation which has been strongly reinforced after the experiences of the last World War and materialized in the Nordic Council, which is charged with tasks of coordination in all fields except foreign policy. Recently a fund for Nordic culture, financed by all the five countries, has come into action with the aim of promoting projects of common interest. This interest might be defined as creating possibilities of more than a superficial mutual knowledge, for as a rule the Scandinavian countries know very little of each other's cultural activities. This is un- fortunately true also in music and shows that Scandinavian unity is doubtful, at least at home. Musical culture presupposes institutions. Situated on the periphery of Europe, Scandinavia established the usual</page><page sequence="284">302 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) musical institution such as opera houses, conservatories etc. relatively late, beginning in the second half of the 1 8th century. • Imre Fábián: "Hungary's New Music between Tradition and Progress," 32^1 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract If one disregards figures such as Franz Liszt or Valentin Bakfark, a lutenist of the 16th cen- tury, Hungarian music has in fact a very short past. Only at the beginning of the 20th century did it find its own language and gain more than a national importance. Its coming into being resembled a revolution against the one-sided influence of German music and also against the ideal of a romantic na- tional music, which in this case meant the sentimental melodies of the Csárdás and Gypsy music. This revolution was the work of two world-famous composers: Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. Bartók, the sensitive cosmopolite, let the melos of his native land flow into the stream of European music; Kodály, more of a classicist, brought his Europeanism into Hungarian music. Thus was fulfilled the romantic dream of Hungarian music as a language of world-wide import that was able to overcome the one-sid- edly national approach as well as the imitative Europeanism. "Hungarian tradition and world culture" were here united for the first time in the history of Magyar music. The great example of this synthesis and the particular musical-historical situation in which it arose led to a conflict in the outlook of the next generation of composers in the 1920's. In one of his famous musical aphorisms Jean Cocteau says that tactful audacity consists in "knowing how far one can go too far." The generation of the 1920's lacked precisely this audacity, this fighting; revolutionary temper directed against the spiritual fathers such as was active at that time in Germany and France. This generation was faced with the choice of either continuing the work begun by the two masters or of renouncing these achievements, whereby at the same time they rendered great service to homely dilettantism and sentimental romanticism. There was no other choice. • Trän Van Khê: "Musicians in North and South Vietnam," 42-51 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : In the old Vietnamese society, men of letters and aristocrats regarded music as a favorite pastime which, in their order of preference, came before chess, poetry and painting. Professional mu- sicians, however, were looked upon with disfavor. Men of letters descended from musicians did not have the right to take the triennial examinations. The Lord of Loc Khe, at the court of the Nguynen, was refused entry to the examinations in 1 592 because his father had been a musician. According to the account of Gaston Knosp, at the beginning of the 20th century official musicians were "put in the same class as soldiers and regarded as domestic servants rather than employees of the Palace;" they were charged with "tasks that were in no way compatible with their abilities." When playing, they had to sit on the ground "since they had no claim to enjoy the same status as the audience which consisted largely of Mandarins sitting at their ease in spacious Chinese armchairs." The professional female singers did not have a good reputation because some of them were of light morals. But the Vietnamese people have always been fond of music, and there have been many "amateur" or "semi-professional" musicians. In their leisure hours many peasants and artisans played the transverse flute {sao, dich ), the two-stringed fiddle (nhi), or the two-stringed moon-shaped lute ( dan nguyet, dan kim) for their own enjoyment, per- formed in ceremonial music ensembles, or took part in singing competitions and the alternate songs, of which there is a very rich and varied repertoire.

Abstract : Western music is steadily insinuating itself into Asian life, I found on my tour. But the old classical forms in some of these countries are being neglected in many quarters. Efforts are being made by devotees in official positions and by private citizens not to let this happen. It would be a pity to allow these subtle, highly characteristic arts to languish while Western forms are being pursued. The musicians of the world should know each other, but something precious would be lost if they al- lowed their art to become homogenized, like so many of civilization's so-called advances. In sum, I was delighted to hear so much competently played Western symphonic music in Japan, but I would have been even happier to hear uniquely Japanese musical voices that would cause the rest of us to pay close attention. • Alain Daniélou: "Cultural Genocide," 6-16 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract. Instead of directing research towards what might be called "research into non-culture," one should attempt, in collaboration with the cultural organizations of African countries, to make a system- atic evaluation of the great cultural currents that have contributed to the development of the musical forms that exist on the African continent, and a serious study of the forms of musical language and communication that survive in Africa, as well as of the original artistic realizations which are their expression. For this we must undertake a complete study of the African continent, independent of state frontiers and ethnic and linguistic divisions, in order to investigate, after the cultural crisis caused by the colonial period, the survivals on the highest artistic and technical level of the musical forms pecu- liar to Africa, and to give them back the place they deserve in the musical creation of our time. Today we are witnessing the gradual disappearance, before the influx of musical conceptions exported by the West - usually already outdated in Europe - of musical forms of universal value but which are con- sidered and treated in their own country as "folkloristic" survivals, good at the most to be "arranged" according to the taste of the day. This in fact leads to a destruction of their entire value as works of art and as original means of communication, hence also of their universal interest. • Jack Bornoff: "Music - A Challenge to Television," 17-31 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The Occidental world has still to discover what excellent TV can be derived from the Ori- ental music theatre. Here, the human being - actor, mime, dancer - stripped of all externals, through a stylized facial expression and gestures alone, creates all the atmosphere, scenery and action which are needed to interpret the great dance-dramas based on Oriental mythology and history. My plea on vol. 11, 1969(1)</page><page sequence="286">304 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) behalf of Oriental music theatre derives not only from my desire to see such magnificent art forms better known in the West, although it would be less than honest of me not to declare my interest. In any case, the success of recent western tours of the Japanese noh theatre and of the Indian kathakali dance-drama speaks for itself. These art forms, with their open stages, with their symbolic gestures and make-up, have much in common with the most advanced kind of Western theatre. And I am convinced that both East and West here contain elements which may help TV to develop an autonomous form of music theatre. • Vladimir Karbusicky: "Electronic Music and the Listener," 32-44 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : From 1965 to 1967 in Czechoslovakia empirical sociological researches into music were carried out which also included electronic music. Three sections from Herbert Eimert's "Epitaph for Aikichi Kuboyama" were used as examples, and they were played to about 4,500 persons. The respon- dents were asked what notions or images these examples evoked in them. The test, which was made on representatives of practically all social groups, was based on various methods such as interviews, ques- tionnaires, and correspondence. The assessment of the material made considerable allowance for the difficulties which inexperienced persons have to combat when asked to give verbal expression to their opinions on music. The more willing the respondents were to take part in the test; the more extensive were their utterances. With these "active persons" several notions set in simultaneously, for example "abhorrence, terror, dread, fright, dance of the devils in hell, perverse murder." Another example shows to what extent the person questioned had entered into the sounds he heard: "I have the feeling that I am on Mars, that strange monsters and dragons are approaching me, and that in the distance the inhabit- ants of Mars are radiating signals." Images of this kind appear to occur most readily since very many respondents expressed themselves in this way, which is due above all to the fact that in electronic mu- sic new and unwonted sounds are produced that differ substantially from the conventional, "stylized" sounds obtained from instruments. This "inhumanness"of the new material obviously evokes such no- tions of catastrophes, strange sounds, and cosmic happenings. Here arises a direct connection between the notion and the impulse of the material. Reports and Information , 45-59 (incl. French and German transi.).

French and German transi.). Abstract : The storm that Pierre Boulez caused in many international tea-cups with his suggestion that opera houses should be demolished gave Karlheinz Stockhausen no peace. In an article for the "Jour- nal Musical Français," he says that one would render the best service to music if one disbanded for a while all orchestras and choruses. The unemployed instrumentalists and singers, who should continue to draw their salaries, would then be free to choose a more pleasant and more profitable form of oc- cupation for the future. Obviously the uproar on principle of the tweens and teenagers has alarmed the over-forties. It remains to be investigated and seen whether such expressions of closing-time panic in father's generation will cause the youth to change its views. It is however striking that in opera houses and in concert halls the number of young listeners is increasing, even when Beethoven and Wagner are played. At the same time interest in the contemporary output appears to grow. • Edith Gerson-Kiwi: "The Oriental Musician," 8-18 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The Oriental musician, even when he possesses great artistry, always remains the spokesman of his community, and his artistic freedom is kept within strict bounds through generally valid manners of performance and a pre-existing reserve of themes. In sharp contrast to his European colleague, he is not allowed to search for originality: he must restrict himself to what is known and familiar to all. Every innovation and personal addition is met with distrust and resistance, is only rarely incorporated in the tradition and even then branded as a later and personal addition. These occasional new creations seldom become historical dates as they do in Europe. In the Oriental musical tradition the historical dimension is absent. The past flows on into the present and the future. The epochs of the world seem to be one, the past remains actual and the present becomes a myth. So it is that one hears musicians of the era of Harun al-Rashid being spoken of as if they lived among us, and, vice versa, living musicians as if they belonged to the revered masters of that epoch. • Luis de Pablo: "The Contemporary Composer and the Music of the Third World," 19-27 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The will to a rapprochement between European music and that of other cultures is a fact that can be easily ascertained in the spheres of art music as well as in those of folk music. This will shows itself precisely at the moment when European and non-European musics are fundamentally changing significance. Since this has always happened in the Western tradition, the realization of such a will requires consciousness on the part of the composer who, through music, is the spokesman of a well- established situation. In the West the development of music depends on the individual awareness of the composer, and it is precisely this close relation between music and this transforming and dynamic awareness that hardly exists in other cultures. Here we see the greatest obstacle to the general evolu- tion of all non-European musical traditions that belong to a heritage that is much more static than ours. However, a number of symptoms permits us to think that this static quality of non-European tradi- tions, which is due to the absence of an evolutive awareness, will not last indefinitely. The acquiring of an evolutive awareness in regard to music is, for all continents, an absolute necessity - paradoxical though this may seem - for the safeguard of each tradition, which would otherwise be condemned to disappear through assimilation or neglect. • Anne-Marie Grosser Piéjus: "Flamenco," 28-43 (incl. French and German transi.). vol. 10, 1968 (4)</page><page sequence="288">306 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : Flamenco is the most original and the most varied manifestation of a musical tradition pecu- liar to Spain. The word flamenco is, however, not synonymous with Spanish folk music, nor even with Andalusian folk music; it is in fact only a particular traditional form of Andalusian music, flamenco music is not art music. It is folk music created by the people and practiced by the people. It is not a music with an academic tradition. The greatest creative musicians and interpreters left no books, no no- tations. Flamenco music is transmitted exclusively by oral methods and by imitation from father to son, from master to pupil, from one festivity to another. Since it is not a written music, flamenco is above all an art of improvisation. But this improvisation develops within the framework of strict musical rules which determine in each form the rhythm, the tonality, the expression and often even the content of the words. Music has always played a predominant part in Andalusian life. Flamenco is thus also a folk art in that it has its place in everyday life. It sings of joy and of love, and also of sorrow and of death. It is in turns a chant for religious ceremonies, a song for secular feasts and for dancing, a work song, a robber's or bandit's song, a regional song, or a simple lullaby. Flamenco music is an art of the people also in the sense that it is fundamentally music for a group. Flamenco most often takes the form of a simultaneous combination of singing, guitar playing and dancing. Even when the singer sings alone or the guitarist plays alone, it is not the music of a soloist that is created, so important is the participation of the audience, or the "aficionado." "Ole! Anda!"

French and German transi.). Abstract : Under the influence of a seventy-year-long contact with European music it occurred readily to jazz musician to divide all musical cultures into "hot" and "cool" - a division which has been pro- posed by different critics since the beginning of the fifties. According to this idea, Indian and Arabian music and the great variety of musical practices of Africa belong to the "hot" musical cultures, while European, Japanese and Javanese music is "cool." To this division one must add the reservation that within the separate cultures there are obviously styles and types of music-making that in each case ap- pear relatively "hotter" or "cooler." In the Japanese tradition certain forms of accompanimental music in the nõ and especially the kabuki theatre are relatively "hotter" than, let us say, the classical Japanese koto music or the old court music {gagaku)' South Indian music is "hotter" than North Indian; in the Indonesian area Balinese music appears to be "hotter" than Javanese although both draw on the same ancient Javanese traditions. Also, in basically "hot" jazz there are - as the expression "cool jazz" sug- gests - naturally "hotter" and "cooler" periods just as in the development of European music. It is not surprising that in jazz it is above all black musicians who are interested in the "hot" musical cultures of India and the Arab world, while the "cooler" musical traditions of Japan and Indonesia says: "We don't want just to imitate the Americans. We are Indonesians and are trying to open up our own musi- cal tradition for modern jazz." To the repertoire of Tony Scott and the "Indonesian All Stars" belong the "Djanger" (a popular sitting dance of the Balinese youth), Javanese spiritual songs and nursery rhymes, and also popular Javanese and Sundanese songs, and, obviously enough, American and Eu- ropean jazz themes. One might also designate as "cool" - in the jazz sense - another SABA record, which resulted from the encounter of the Hideo Shiraki Quintet, the leading Japanese jazz combo, with three girl players of the koto: "Sakura Sakura." Shinichi Yuize is incidentally the first traditional Japanese musician to have recorded with a jazz man, again Tony Scott, completely free improvisations and mood impressions ("Music for Zen Meditation," Verve). Typical, and also symbolic of the meeting of jazz with the musical cultures of the world is a disc of Yusef Lateef, saxophonist, and Muslim from Detroit. It is called "A flat, G flat and C" (Impulse). This disc contains an Egyptian, a Chinese and a Japanese piece - each of them in blues form, and, naturally enough, also swinging "American" blues in the conventional style. This is, in a figurative sense, exactly what so many jazz musicians of the sixties are doing: the music of the world is "brought into blues form." • André Hodeir: "Free Jazz," 20-29 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : In connection with free jazz" one cannot talk of movement or of diversity: everything here seems to want to remain in a single color, in immobility. The "free" improviser objects to the idea of de- velopment on which written jazz is based, and substitutes for it (as John Coltrane has already done) the circular, gyratory, sometimes ornamented process (as with Omette Coleman) of episodic gadgets. This is no longer the world of drama; it is the world of ceremony. And it is from the vocabulary of magic that one is tempted to borrow terms when it is a matter of portraying "free jazz," its magic charms, its incantatory power. This magic, one suspects, is not neutral. In a certain way, "free jazz," like the hap- pening, like the "living theatre," is a remote product of Dada: one cannot therefore be surprised that, like these, it reveals evident political intentions. The claim, the protestation, the dispute have found a way to become acclimatized to the scene; but the orchestra platform is still strange ground to them. The aggressiveness of the "free" musicians which animates, or does not animate, social resentment and racial hatred is seen to reabsorb itself in a "ritualization" of a struggle in which they would not know how to engage. • Edison Denissow: "New Music and Jazz," 30-37 (incl. French and German transi.).</page><page sequence="290">308 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : Jazz has now so firmly taken root in contemporary music that this question is no longer open to discussion. The adoption of this or that element of jazz in composition is the personal problem of each author (in the same way as the attitude to folk music). Some composers regard jazz as a primitive form of art and consider that an appeal to jazz forms is a concession to the taste of the public (many have reproached Stravinsky and Bartok with unnecessary "folklorism"), others are convinced that there are no artificial limits to the scope of contemporary music and that any forms of the "primitive" can be integrated by the composer. In recent years there has occurred an interesting and completely natural process of rapprochement between many applied forms and serious music. • Henry Pleasants: "Jazz and the Movies," 38^47 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Music in the motion pictures is, after all, music in the theater; and it has been in the theater, and specifically in the American musical theater, that compatibility has been most nearly achieved. Neither the classical musician attempting to absorb or exploit the infectious vitality of jazz (Milhaud, Krenek, Stravinsky, Copland, Liebermann), nor the jazz musician attempting to achieve respectability by drawing upon the symphonic orchestra and classical forms (Ellington, Teo Macero, William Russo, Pete Rugolo, John Lewis and many others) has been able to achieve anything but an unsatisfactory hybrid. Nor have the so-called "third stream" exercises of the past decade, most notably Gunther Schuller's opera "The Visitation," shown much promise. If the motion picture underscore has been late in emerging as the most promising area of reconciliation and amalgamation, it may well be because neither the motion picture nor the state of jazz composition has previously been ready for it. Holly- wood, during the era of the big studios, was hardly noted for a spirit of adventure. Jazz writing, at the same time, was largely a matter of sketching and so-called "head arrangements," which left more to the devices and impulses of the individual player than is tolerable within the rigid disciplines of film scoring. The breakthrough came with the more or less coincidental emergence of the small independent motion picture producer and the skilled and literate jazz composer-arranger, the latter a product, in turn, of the requirements of the highly polished big bands of the "forties and fifties - Stan Kenton, Count Basie, Woody Herman, Shorty Rogers, and many others.

Abstract : Unfortunately not all modern cultural problems can be solved simply and dynamically. Yet the return to primitive methods sometimes proves successful elsewhere. The epoch-making success of the Beatles, whose long hair contrasts so comically with their childlike and anti-professorial mu- sic, could hardly be explained in any other way. Their melodiousness obviously disrupts the esoteric complexity of modern jazz just as Kurt Weill's songs in his "Beggar's Opera" disrupted the dreaded atonal music. • Michael Jenne: "The Role of Tradition in Musical Education," 8-16 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : At all levels of musical education and training the intercultural, beside the inter-epochal comparison proposes itself today more than ever before as an educational principle. Musical life in general could also receive new impulses from this. The first attempts at intercultural festival programs have been made, and this development should be followed up more systematically. A tradition is worth as much as its present statement. It is not preservation as a monument that traditional music requires, but actualization in the musical consciousness. To develop and refine our perception for this is the task of music education. • Alain Daniélou: "Musical Education in Asia and Africa," 17-25 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : A large part of the musical heritage of mankind, which is today in danger, can only be saved if great national and international efforts are made to encourage the teaching of music by the great traditional masters, and according to proven methods, to selected pupils, in order to train new genera- tions of musicians for whom larger and larger audiences must then be found. A national audience is no longer sufficient since all people dream of occupying a place in the international scene. This is why the problems in musical education particular to each country are problems that should be studied on an international level to allow the continuation of the high forms of musical art which may seem strange or "exotic" to us today, but which ultimately constitute our common heritage, the sources of our future. The study of a foreign language or of different musical languages should only be undertaken when we are already thoroughly trained in our own idiom. • Egon Kraus: "The Value of International Competitions," 26^10 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : International music competitions are assuming an ever greater cultural-political importance. For the best talents they are an almost indispensable springboard for an international career. A com- parative investigation - especially if it takes into consideration the experiences gained at international competitions - can be of great service in a critical examination of the respective situation and in the development of new conceptions. The first statistic investigation made into the results of international music competitions for interpreters takes into account data on 34 international competitions in 1 9 Eu- ropean and overseas countries. Among these are 16 competitions for instrumentalists, 7 for singers, 4 for conductors, and a further 7 in which several sections are represented. Between the years 1 956 and 1966, 352 first, 473 second, and 261 third prizes, in all 1086 prizes were awarded to young interpreters at these 34 competitions. vol. 10, 1968 (2)</page><page sequence="292">310 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Festivals • John Evarts: "Festival Donaueschingen," 41-45 (incl.

Abstract : The problems that arise today in the field of music are to a great extent analogous to those found in other branches of art, science and culture. Both humanizing and dehumanizing movements have always coexisted, and they also coexist today. In the history of mankind in general, and in that of music-in particular, every true conquest is accompanied by losses and the appearance of contrary or parasitic tendencies. Thus it is that the genuine and legitimate "specialization" in modern music, its achievement of complete autonomy in comparison with other arts, its emancipation from the various social functions of former times, as well as the tremendous awareness of the contemporary composer which, at least on the technical level, has become more considered and clear, too often cause one to forget the fact that music in itself has no raison d'être , that one does not create or play it simply to vol. 10, 1968(1)</page><page sequence="293">2. Contents and Abstracts • 311 satisfy an intrinsic requirement (music being neither by nature nor by purpose an object of speculation or a technique), but that it should serve the public. In opposition to this humanist conception of music stand two other conceptions in which certain currents of contemporary evolution converge. The musi- cal world will henceforth be invaded by technicalism and particularization. Contemporary musicians, and especially those of the avant-garde, are interested above all in the inherent requirements of their art that is conceived in the first place as a technique. • Kapila Vatsyayan: " Kathãkali - Dance Theatre of India," 22-35. Abstract. The Kathãkali of today is the culmination of a long process of evolution and assimilation of different theatrical forms existent in South India. It is not a solo dance like the contemporary Bharata Natyam. It is not a courtly dance like Kathak and it is not lyrical in the same manner as Manipuri. In- stead, the first impression made by this dance style is its overwhelming dramatic quality in which gods and heroes, demons and spirits appear from another world in costumes and head-gears which are awe- inspiring, belonging to a world of myth and legend and not to the real world of human beings. The the- matic content of the Kathãkali dance-dramas is derived from the myths and legends of the Hindu epics and the Puranas. In accordance with certain canons of the epic tradition, drama is built by counterpois- ing certain types of characters against others. Although the hero and the villain of Sanskrit drama are known to Kathãkali , the different types of heroes known to the Kathãkali tradition can be traced back more easily to the epics and the mythological stories of the Puranas rather than to the classical Sanskrit theatre. An examination of the literary works reveals that there were perhaps other types in existence, but during the last 1 50 or 200 years Kathãkali drama has been restricted to about six types. The story is conveyed by means of pure dance, dance-theatre and pantomime. The stories are written in Malayalam, one of the principal Dravidian languages of India, and the text is very closely followed. Festivals , Events , 36-52 (incl. French and German transi.).

French and German transi.). Abstract What are the external problems? An ill-balanced and feeble economy which prevents us from competing with other continents, and makes impossible any import or export of cultural goods; unfavorable judgments on our music not only in Europe but throughout the world (every people, like ourselves, struggling to catch up with the latest cultural trend in Europe). It is interesting to observe that this mistrust can finally be traced to European teachers, since the majority of our Latin-American musicians have received a European training either directly or indirectly. The general drift of the above will enable the reader to form an idea of the difficulties which stand in the way of the propagation of the true values of our music, whether of the present day, of the colonial or pre-Columbian periods. This ignorance of our own reality explains the prejudices that must be overcome and removed. • Maurice Fleuret: "A Trip to the United States," 9-16 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract In former times, the "musical journey" took one to Italy. Handel, Mozart and many others did not fail to maintain the tradition. Then it was Germany: Lavignac counseled the true pilgrim to pay homage at Bayreuth... on bended knees! But the times have changed, nationalism has broken out in every quarter, schools and centers have multiplied. One now goes to learn at Darmstadt, to listen in Warsaw, Venice or Royan, to work with Stockhausen in Cologne, with Pierre Schaeffer in Paris, with Boulez in Basel, with Berio in New York, etc. etc. There is no longer a holy land of music; there are now only individuals, "personalities" residing here or there in the milieu most favorable to their development. How is it then that for some time now America has been a haven for the greatest musi- cians of all nationalities and creeds? Without going back as far as Dvořák and Mahler, we are obliged to admit that all the musical thoroughfares of our century have passed through America. Schönberg or Hindemith, Bartók or Stravinsky are as important for the history of American music as they are for that of the world. It is not only because they found peace and quiet there and a certain material com- fort that they stayed for so long, but rather, so it seems to me, because this vast land without a past (or almost so), without a suffocating tradition, and completely orientated towards the future, offered an ideal stimulus for their thought. • Alexander Tcherepnin: "A Trip to the Soviet Union," 17-22 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract It appears to me that all these composers of the Soviet Union, independently of personal styles of writing and tendencies are endeavoring to serve the people with the greatest awareness of their responsibilities. The Russian composer does not live in isolation. His works are performed and his contact with the public, in the widest sense of the word, gives him the necessary corrective for his work. What he receives from the people, he gives back to them in the form of his work of art. Progress in music runs parallel to progress in the general level of culture. To music which is appropriate to the present, belongs also the future. As Bach recorded his "present" in music, as Beethoven reflected the tendencies of his time, as Debussy gave expression in sound to his age, so do the composers of the Soviet Union wish to create a music that arises from the relations between the cultural situation of the people and the creative capacity of the artist. This attitude on the part of the composer in no way ex- cludes an individual approach; the creative artist has the freedom to determine for himself what means he will employ for the realization of his aims. In the Soviet Union we thus find composers of various tendencies and with very different artistic persuasions; each one senses the present in his own way and tries to record it in sound. • Kurt Suttner: "Music in the Kingdom of the Lion of Juda," 23-32 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The Ethiopian Emperor, the Lion of Juda, derives the descent of his ancestors from King Sol- omon. Ethiopia is a land with three thousand years of history. Against a long and turbulent past stands a short period of complete upheaval resulting from contact with the modern world. The conflict between the forces of tradition and of progress leaves its imprint on every aspect of life in Ethiopia today. The</page><page sequence="295">2. Contents and Abstracts • 313 Ethiopian people constitute a mixture of several different ethnic groups. An indigenous Negroid popu- lation was overlaid in the second millennium B.C. by a wave of Cushitic immigrants. In the first mil- lennium B.C. Semitic Sabeans from South Arabia founded trading colonies which later severed their connections with the mother land and developed into an independent kingdom with a capital at Axum. The language of the Axumite kingdom, today still the language of the Ethiopian church, is closely re- lated to Arabic and Hebrew. In the fourth century King Ezana declared Christianity the official religion. A large part of the missionary work was performed by the "Nine Saints," the so-called Second Apostles of Ethiopia who came from Syria towards the end of the fifth century. These monks brought not only the doctrine of the single nature, human and divine, of Christ, Monophysitism, but also the liturgical music of the Syrian mother church. But ritual music of Jewish origin had undoubetly already existed in Ethiopia. Today, the entire culture of Ethiopia is in a state of upheaval. The number of those who have a real knowledge of the church music is diminishing every year. The prospect of being able to take up a modern and respectable career after a relatively short time by studying at a State school deters many young Ethiopians from embracing the arduous and often wretched life of a singer. The repertoire of folk music is, as everywhere today, threatened by the hit tunes and dance music imported from Europe and America, all the more so since these cheap imported goods penetrate even into the remote corners of the land owing to the ever increasing dissemination by the radio. This situation could lead either to the disappearance of the indigenous tradition or to a healthy and creative conflict - depending on the forces that are awakened in Ethiopia.

While the printing of music only raises problems of mechanics and of the legible disposition of musical symbols, analysis presupposes a great deal of musical and historical information which is difficult to program. Nonethe- less, preparatory tasks such as numerical operations, the drawing up of lists, and comparisons between quantities that can be represented by numbers, can easily be performed by a computer. Quantitative analysis is more obvious in music than in painting or literature, since its audibly perceptible structure usually consists of distinct elements (pitch, volume, duration, etc.), which are also composed as such, while the phonetic structure of a poem is only meaningful as the bearer of semantic values. • Jan Matějček: " Vera Musica Nova in Czechoslovakia," 14-17 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : During the past few years in Czechoslovakia a conflict between two different conceptions of the nature of modern composition has become increasingly apparent. This is not concerned with purely academic questions arising from the assessment of individual stylistic trends in contemporary music, but with the practical problem as to which kind of contemporary music has the greater justifica- tion in Czechoslovakia - and elsewhere: music that is based exclusively on the latest achievements in sonority and technique, or music that makes use of these achievements but at the same time does not wish to restrict its appeal by giving preference to those elements that are foreign to the general musi- cal consciousness. The stating of this problem is closely linked with the special place that music has always occupied in the life of Czechoslovakia, a land in which this art in particular has been of great significance during a history of more than a thousand years. During periods of oppression the people expressed themselves through a music that helped them to assert their national independence; they marched into battle chanting songs, and their modern history began with a great upsurge of musical activity. Music here was never the property of a privileged class, and more than with other nations its contact with everyday life and close connections with society are a question of its very existence and meaning. • Tolia Nikiprowetzky: "Broadcasting and African Music," 18-26 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : "Connaissance des musiques traditionnelles" is the title of a new series of studies that have since January 1 967 been included in a weekly bulletin. At the end of each article is given a bibliography that is as complete as possible. The combined results of these efforts should provide inspiration for a new production on music which we hope will be launched towards the end of this year. The programs will be sent weekly, and the contents will be based on ideas drawn from comparative musicology. For example, comparisons will be made between various instruments of the same type but used in different forms of traditional music belonging to different continents. A similar treatment will be given to sev- eral musical genres that exhibit certain analogous features although belonging to civilizations that are geographically very distant from one another. We should not, however, pretend that the action taken by broadcasting companies in the field of music will bear fruit in Africa in the immediate future. At this stage such action should be coordinated with other efforts, for example those undertaken by the various cultural centers. It ought to be suggested that discussions, with recorded examples, be organized after each particular broadcast. This kind of thing has been done for other fields of study, and the resulting exchanges of opinion have proved very fruitful. In conclusion, we should bear in mind the consider- able part played by broadcasting in the preservation of traditional African music. Recordings are made regularly and, after the broadcast, deposited in the record library of the station. • Fela Sowande: "The African Musician in Nigeria," 27-36 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Nigeria had a second revolution in July 1966, the aftermath of which is still with us. Curi- ously enough this has led to two developments which, I am certain, would have been at least another year or two in coming. In the first place, it has transformed what started less than a year ago as a local Nigerian Program into an International Educational Program.

These tapes, together with written and illustrative materials, give more than a little insight into the traditional way of life of the Nigerian peoples. This expanded program has, moreover, found a cen- ter in the U. S.A., where the Broadcasting Foundation of America in New York most readily undertook to serve as its repository and distributing center. It is planned to have other centers in Europe as well as its natural Nigerian center. Furthermore, in the second place, it has resulted in the current attempt to organize a Central Body of Nigerian Artists, under some such title as "The Society of the Professional Artists of Nigeria," as a Cultural Educational Organization operating on a nation-wide basis, clear of all political, ideological, sectarian, or tribal affiliations and overtones.

Abstract : I came to know Peruvian music during the course of a long journey with Jean-Louis Barrault, and also the music of Black Africa. I have carefully studied and also transcribed Indian music, but if knowledge and study of these civilizations has influenced me they have only done so on the spiritual level. I have found an ethics of existence rather than aesthetics of enjoyment. The influence is on my spirit and not on my work. The main points are as follows: the time structure, the conception of time being different; the idea of anonymity; the idea of a work of art not being admired as a masterpiece vol. 9, 1967 (2)</page><page sequence="298">316 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) but as an element of spiritual life. The technical aspects, which are always analyzed and regarded as being of primary importance when a contemporary European score is studied, are here a completely secondary matter. We are well aware that Asia has attributed the utmost significance to the organization of intervals, and with a unique sensitivity. I would be happy to acquire this acuteness of listening, this fineness of the horizontal interval disengaged from the thickness of polyphony, but this would involve working out a different kind of polyphony. The precision in the organization of rhythmic structures also interests me. It is very great in the music of India and Bali. Certain intermediary dimensions in improvisation, especially in the wonderful gagaku , I also find of great interest. I like this not wholly defined dimension which gradually becomes defined. There is here no masterpiece achieved for all time, one learns to live within the music and to make one's choice there. The influence of India and Japan is thus an influence of thought. But there is no sense in trying to build specimens of Oriental music into contemporary music; no influence is good except when it is transcended. There are no exact illustrations in contemporary music of which one can say that they are derived from this or that rãga. This would be folklore. To transfer such elements - as is done by some - is completely mistaken, it is the quest for the lost paradise. • Shigeo Kishibe: "Japanese Music - Conflict or Synthesis?," 11-21 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Conflict or coexistence of the traditional music and modern Western music in Japan began with the Meiji Revolution in 1868, which opened feudal Japan to the modern world and initiated the modernization of its culture, music included. At present, generally speaking, Japanese interest in mu- sic is mainly directed towards Western music, both classical and popular. Ninety per cent of musical education in primary and high schools is concerned with Western music (e. g. works by Schubert and Beethoven) and with well-known folk songs of Europe and the United States. Ninety per cent of TV and radio programs consists of a large number of American popular songs, jazz and classics. On almost every night of the year concerts and recitals of popular and classical music take place in the larger cit- ies. In the Tokyo National Conservatory of Music and in several major private music colleges quite a number of students are trained to be professional musicians, some of whom obtain international recognition through further study abroad and win prizes at international competitions. This predomi- nance of Western music in modern Japan has largely been the cause of the decline of traditional music. However, the traditional music has been preserved not only as dead classics but also as a living art cultivated mainly by the older generation, although the number of music-lovers has been gradually decreasing. Most of the major genres of traditional music, the ancient court music {gagaku ) from the eighth century, the noh play from the 1 5th century and the koto, shamisen, shakuhachi and biwa music from the 1 7th century, are performed by professional musicians of each genre and appreciated by quite a number of amateur musicians. The noh play, koto music and shamisen music have the biggest num- ber of adherents and the number of amateur musicians who take lessons in the singing of the noh play is assumed to be two million. However, as we pointed out above, interest in traditional music is much smaller than that in Western music. Beside individual endeavors to preserve the traditional music, some national and public organizations are contributing to projects for the protection of traditional properties of music. The Ministry of Education honors a dozen of the most outstanding musicians by appointing them, "Possessor of National Property" (Human Treasury), and grants them annuity. • Ross Lee Finney: "America Goes West," 22-30 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : When we think of the young American composer today we must add this westward orienta- tion, this change of balance, to the other qualities that form our tradition - love of technical control, individualism and idealism, the folk heritage and its new adjustment to urban life - and we must also realize that a technological revolution has changed our concept of what music is. If we find a degree of confusion, an even greater diversity than we have known in the past, we should not be greatly sur- prised. Certain figures stand out since the Great War. John Cage is the theorist of one aspect of our contemporary music and Milton Babbitt the theorist of another. That they conflict is understandable, but their opposition is probably not as real as it seems. From the west Cage brings an attitude towards time and towards the whole aesthetics of the musical experience. From technology Babbit brings pre-</page><page sequence="299">2.

Both theories are neither European nor Oriental. In Elliot Carter's music there is a subtle blend of the traditional perfectionist and the radical idealist. • Fritz Winckel: "Music and Architectural Space," 3 1^2 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : In the meantime, relations between architect and acoustician have considerably improved, and some surprising solutions have been reached in the building of concert halls which posterity may possibly designate with the general term "acoustic style in architecture." The design of the hall now takes acoustic calculations into consideration but still leaves ample scope for the architect. Sound dif- fusing elements are built into the walls and ceilings, for example in the form of protruding wooden boxes (Berlin Funkhaus), laminated or latticed paneling (Salzburg Festspielhaus), boxes that jut out into the auditorium in diagonal formation (first incorporated in the London Festival Hall and imitated in the opera houses of Hamburg, Cologne and Mannheim), coffer-work ceilings as in the halls listed in the above table, also slightly concave ceilings which disperse the reflected sound evenly. The latter are in addition often fitted with laminated panel-work, ribs, triangular moldings, etc. Such decorations and fittings are now termed neo-Baroque, and we should remember that the richly decorated Baroque style is suitable from an acoustic point of view for the performance of music as long as the optimum time of reverberation is not exceeded and an adequate balance between high and low registers is main- tained. The late Romantic composers derived great advantage in every respect from the properties of the equally richly adorned halls of the neo-classical period. As a result of this several halls were built in imitation of the finest halls, for example the Tonhalle in Zurich (1895). The creation of "space music" has its prototype in the Berlin Philharmonie (1965) with 2200 seats. It is characterized by a tent-like basic design and also by the fact that the orchestra podium is situated almost in the center of the hall. The question now arises as to what can stimulate the composers in this period of the optimum repro- duction of sound, and how a new style can develop from this vantage point.

This was a performance of Luciano Berio's "Espo- sizione" in the dramatic interpretation of the "Dancer's Workshop of San Francisco" under the artistic direction of Ann Halprin. Since 1951 this American troupe has developed new possibilities of stage technique. Its members are "total" actors in Stanislavsky's sense of the word: dancers, acrobats, actors, and singers. The performance was the expression of an aesthetic sur-naturalism. All visible, audible and movable elements of the theatre are here mobilized; the auditorium is part of the scene of action. Mysterious and disquieting proceedings are enacted on the stage, lights flash in the auditorium, peals of laughter are heard and boxes are lit up with beams of light. The prompt-box and the orchestra pit are also brought into the action. Through the voice of Cathy Berberian, speaking, singing, whistling, laughing, and hissing become new and virtuoso artistic techniques such as may have been in Schön- berg's mind when he composed "Pierrot Lunaire" in 1912. • Yannis Xenakis: "ad libitum. . ." 17-19 (incl.

Improvisation, freedom of the interpreter, directed chance, open form, aleatory music, "hap- penings," these are hot irons, urgent problems of contemporary music. The following contributions, manifestoes or pamphlets rather than analyses, do not set out to answer riddles or offer solutions. Three authors give their personal views which should excite the reader's criticism. Xenakis: The expression "aleatory music" in fact means improvised music. The use of the word aleatory, which in its scientific sense implies chance, in place of improvisation is a sheer abuse of the term and exposes an attitude which is falsifying and sentimental. To trade with chance in matters of art or science requires a deep understanding of the philosophy of history, the knowledge of the theory of probabilities and of stochas- tics. But the way in which "aleatory," "graphic" or "improvised" music claims to negotiate with chance is an aping of thought that has cornered certain aspects of life, thought that has penetrated practically all the physical and human sciences. It is a sacrifice to fashion, as when the local seamstress crudely imi- tates the splendid creations of the great designers, a kind of deceit, a bluffing of the public and above all of oneself. The composer has abdicated. When we begin to speak of the intuition that is implied in improvisation and of the freedom from inhibitions that improvisation can induce, we leave the domain of falsified knowledge mentioned above to enter the tinsel world of psychoanalysis. Scandalism be- comes a technique and is mistaken for "art" which is denied and despised. • Alain Danielou: "ad libitum. . ." 20-22 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Improvisation is a similar process in diverse musical systems. The musician, in order to im- provise, must have something to say, an emotive center and a guiding sentiment, but also needs a very precise grammar, an unerring logic of patterns ready to hand. The development of an Indian rãga is in no way different as a mental process to a discourse or a sermon in which the speaker seeks to express a guiding idea by means of a coherent grammar and carefully prepared effects. Without the force of the thematic and emotional idea, without the strict framework of the modal scale, the pre-established patterns, the nuances of attack and the ornaments that enhance the expression, improvisation is im- vol. 9, 1967(1)</page><page sequence="301">2. Contents and Abstracts *319 possible. It is probably the excessive degree of freedom in the relationships between sounds and the absence of formulae that lead some contemporary musicians to believe that an element of chance intervenes in improvisation. Precisely the opposite is true. A speaker, who would employ words at random without the logical links determined by the expression of clearly-formed thoughts in a strictly established conventional linguistic formula, would be booed by his audience and would soon run out of ideas. Exactly the same holds good for musical improvisation, the result of long practice and abso- lute mastery of the phrases of a precise language. We have no means of communicating apart from the formulae of a language. We recognize the value of a language by the richness of its vocabulary and by the complexity of its grammatical conventions. It is the same in music. To think that music can be a means of communication outside the domain of a conventional and established language, which we can indeed extend and modify but not ignore, is but a childish and barren dream. The freedom thus acquired destroys the instrument of expression that every language, musical or spoken, represents for the human being. The possibilities of free discourse and of improvisation are eternally limited by the conventions of a language. • Francis Miroglio: "ad libitum. . 23-26 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Owing to its ambiguity the adjective "improvised," applied to music, is understood by many to connote such different entities as aleatory music, graphic music, open form and more or less di- rected chance. A fleeting survey of this question, which is of primary importance for the written music of today, cannot give an account of its many aspects but merely single out certain characteristics of "behavior" related to this problem. Certain people suffering from fancied inhibitions and forced into the strait-jacket of the seasonal vogue of snobbism, imagine that they find in improvisation the ideal outlet for their unalleviated sentimentality and an "up to date" expression of their need for romantic escape. At the other end, one might say at the other end of the street, appears the "happening," now taken down from its artistic pedestal. Social, within reach of everyman's comprehension, it tries to re- late individuals to one another as well as events which it takes from the background of everyday life in order to attempt to raise them to the level of a symbolism intended as a vehicle for relieving inhibitions. This communal game played by immature adolescents trying desperately to assert themselves results in a co-ownership which pretends to be artistic. Although not exactly sprung from similar sociological conditions, the abundance of improvised musical forms should be viewed with no less caution. Do we not see today a multitude of pages of music covered only with "significant" dabs? The rest, all the rest, is written in invisible ink and must be revealed by the interpreter only in the full exercise of a newly discovered freedom! • Vivek Datta and Mukund Lath: "Improvisation in Indian Music," 27-34 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : When an Indian musician sings or plays he does not "improvise," at least not in the sense in which the word "improvisation" is commonly used in Western musical terminology. His aim is to build the structural character of a particular modal form which is called a räga. In this elaboration his "improvisation" does not merely consist in the technical development of a "theme" which can neither contain the extensible quality of a raga, nor could it ever have the many-sided potentiality inherent in the structure of a räga. In fact, varied "themes" with many improvisations can be introduced in a raga , each one of them with the intention of revealing different facets of the räga. Confusion may, indeed, arise if a räga be equated with a theme. A raga holds in itself elements that are fixed as well as those that are malleable; in its elaboration neither of them can be ignored. One of the mysteries of a fertile and unbroken tradition is that in it contraries are reconciliated. Nothing in it can overtly be stated as rigidly fixed and yet its archetypal forms, which over the ages continue to be the source of inspiration and of creative expression, remain inviolable. A räga , in its final description, is, perhaps, such an ar- chetypal musical form. • Jack Bornoff: "UNESCO and Music, 35-39.

From this General Conference, we</page><page sequence="302">320 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) learn that UNESCO wishes to have a policy for music - its own policy for music. I made it clear that the IMC would not be doing the job for which it was invented if we had not by now obtained a clear idea of the needs of the various branches of music - through our twelve important international orga- nizations, each of them representing a musical branch and with ramifications in the Member States, and through our national committees in over 40 countries. We have the necessary structure to carry out many of the tasks for music which the delegates outlined in their various resolutions. Some of these tasks are already being carried out - too modestly, perhaps, for obvious reasons - but as the Assembly recognized, with a measure of success. • Rudolf Heinemann: "Zoltán Kodály ( 1 882-1 967)," 40. Abstract Zoltán Kodály, who died at the age of 84, was one of the very few composers who were suc- cessful in recasting elements of national and folk music in a musical language with an international and almost universal appeal. Together with Béla Bartók he rendered services of the greatest value to musical studies in collecting and analyzing the traditional music of his native land. He made a sub- stantial contribution to an awakening of interest in Hungarian music, which acquired the widest rec- ognition through Kodály's efforts, not the least of which was his reorganization of musical education in Hungary.

Contents and Abstracts *321 Abstract : The primary aim of the Congress was described as follows by J. Wouters, chairman of the Netherlands National Music Committee, during the opening session: "It is to become more familiar with the various attempts at lessening the distance between the composer of today and the public, as they are currently being undertaken in musical centers of very different structures and outlooks. Thus, we shall learn of ways and means of creating a better understanding of modern musical idioms and can help one another to find methods which can be used to the advantage of composers, performers, concert managers, and audiences." During the course of the four days of the Congress, an impressive amount of knowledge, experience, opinions and speculation was pooled. It would require a staff of mu- sicologists, psychologists and etymologists to separate and prepare an orderly analysis of the parallels and cross-connections in all the thoughts expressed. During a corresponding number of sessions "the public" was examined in the form of four categories: (1) the specialist public, (2) the general public, (3) the mass public, and (4) the young public. From the very beginning the conclusion emerged from the papers given that these distinctions merely represented an artificial classification - and could not be preserved in practice. The most striking overlap was between the categories of general and mass public. Yet, it also seemed obvious from the reports on the specialist and young publics that there was a great degree of similarity here as well.

Abstract : Discussions brought out the facts, for example, that the phenomenon of improvisation is not universal in Asia, that the system of modes finds differing characteristics from one Asian country to an- other, and elements like melodic contour, register, tempo and ornamentation rather than scales are the basis of comparison between Northern and Southern Indian rãgas. Apart from these and other precise descriptions of musical traits, one sees larger elements that separate one Asian music from the other. A great number of percussion instruments in the Philippines, the gong orchestras in Southeast Asia, smaller ensembles in India, "split-sound" groups in China and Japan mark the differences in the cul- tural traditions to which these musics belong. Marginal discussions dealt with the possible subjects of future symposia. There was a suggestion that topics concentrate on specific musical elements (for ex- ample, melody, mode, rhythm) among several groups in Asia, rather than on separate subjects referring to different peoples. Still another suggestion was to study universal "structures" (pitch, scale, densities, range) in all musics and the means of identifying them through mathematical formulae. • Trän Van Khê: "Quelques Impressions d'un Participant au Colloque International des Musiques d'Asie à Manila," 80-81 (in French only). vol. 8, 1966 (4-5)</page><page sequence="304">322 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : Pour la première fois, des musiciens ethnomusicologues, spécialistes des musiques d'Orient, se sont réunis à Manille, dans un pays asiatique, pour présenter les principales traditions musicales d'Asie, sous le double angle de l 'exécution musicale et des recherches musicologiques.

Three Distinguished Composers - Kodály, Dallapiccola, and Jolivet - Speak at the 'Jeunesse Musicales 9 Congress on Music Education in the World Today at UNESCO House , April 12th , 1966 • Zoltán Kodàly: ["Music Education in the World Today"], 81-82 (also in French and German transi., 87-88; 97-98). Abstract The great majority of composers take pleasure in teaching their métier. But people have fre- quently asked me how a musician-composer like me could become so interested in and permanently preoccupied with musical instruction in primary schools instead of continuing to compose. To un- derstand my position, one must glance briefly at the past. When I arrived as a very young man in my country's capital, I thought that its musical life was completely normal: a beautiful opera house built in 1885, concerts and performances of all kinds, a famous Conservatory founded by Liszt in 1875 (whose first project, proposed in 1 842, could not be realized because of the sad events which swept across Hun- gary). But little by little, I noticed that the excellent virtuosi trained in this conservatory were forced to go abroad to earn their living, that one always saw the same faces at the concerts and that our mag- nificent opera house was often half empty. In short, there was a very limited public for serious music. The majority of the population preferred the repertoire of gypsy orchestras and was just barely capable of enjoying light operettas. The "fabricators" of sonatas were consequently forced to realize that they lived in an imaginary world, and I myself had to awaken to this bitter reality • Luigi Dallapiccola: ["Music Education in the World Today"], 82-83 (also in French and German transi., 88-89; 98-100). Abstract : In his invitation to me to come to express to you my faith in music and to explain to you my point of view on the direction which music education should take in order to make real music lovers of you all, Mr. Nicoly told me that among my listeners there would be young people from twenty-five countries. But, as there are countries where music studies are begun in the primary schools and others where music is completely neglected, you will understand how touchy it is for me to speak of the mu- sical education of young people. All the more so, in that it is absolutely contrary to my way of doing things to hand down pronouncements or, if you prefer, to give instructions on "how to use." So, I will begin by reading you a few moving lines addressed "to youth" by Ferruccio Busoni (that great mind, whose 100th birthday has just been celebrated). Here they are: "In no matter what period, youth exists and is always the same: at the beginning, believing, enthusiastic, generous and faithful; later, superior, egocentric, mistrustful and independent - until a new generation of youth takes its place. My love goes to youth - und it will be like this in the future. . ." • André Jolivet: ["Music Education in the World Today"], 83-84 (also in French and German transi., 89-90; 100-01). Abstract : When society will have been entirely subjugated to a machine-like existence, even in the most quantitative and rational areas, there will still be room, if not for dreaming, at least for intuition and for the exercise of personal choice. Under the influence of the machine and of high-powered think-</page><page sequence="305">2. Contents and Abstracts • 323 ing we are witnessing an unprecedented release of unused energies. Modern man risks not knowing what to do with the time and power he has released, but he will still have something that we shall call, for lack of a better name, "emotionality" - the ability to be moved. And as long as this emotionality exists in man, he will have need of music, of that joy coming from an exaltation of energies, in com- munion with the collective spirit. The insistence on rationality in our time, our faith in the value of posi- tive phenomena, does not forbid us from extending this positivism to spiritual phenomena. Our role as musicians is to unify the two currents that divide our century, the passion of the earth to construct and the passion of heaven to attain. By casting out anxiety, by turning into light the worst shadows of the world, we will help men to discover the universal and ultimate goal toward which they must direct the striving impulses of their spirits.

Abstract : Ainsi, comme nous venons de le voir, si des analogies (sur des points tout théoriques) existent entre les musiques de l'Orient et celles de l'Occident, elles ne doivent pas nous masquer les différen- ces fondamentales entre elles. On ne saurait porter un jugement défavorable sur une musique qui n'est pas la sienne en se référant aux critères valables seulement dans sa propre tradition, ni emprunter aux musiques étrangères des éléments incompatibles avec son langage musical sous prétexte de «moder- niser» celui-ci. Qu'il nous soit permis, pour conclure, de citer ces passages de Sir Rabindranath Ta- gore à propos de la différence de nature entre les deux musiques d'Orient et d'Occident: «La musique européenne est semblable au monde du jour: un flot de vaste harmonie composée de consonances et de dissonances. La musique indienne est le monde de la nuit: un rãga pur, profond et tendre. Toutes les deux nous bouleversent, cependant toutes les deux sont contra-dictoires dans leur essence. Mais on n'y peut rien. Des l 'origine, la nature est diversée en deux: le jour et la nuit, l 'unité et la variété, le fini et l'infini...» Cependant, cela ne veut pas dire que les musiques orientales soient à jamais impénétrables pour un auditeur d'Occident, et que les musiques occidentales soient incompréhensibles pour le public d'Orient; pour qu'un Européen puisse goûter avec profit les musiques de l 'Orient, et qu'un Asiatique puisse aimer les musiques de l'Occident, les échanges culturels sont utiles et un travail d'initiation est indispensable, car «la musique, quoiqu'on dise, n'est pas une langue universelle: il faut l 'arc des mots pour faire pénétrer la fèeche des sons dans le coeur de tous!» (Remain Rolland: Jean-Christophe).

Abstract : Tout au long de l'histoire, nous pouvons observer que l'intrusion dans une culture donnée d'éléments scientifiques, religieux, philosophiques ou artistiques provenant d'une autre culture, provo- que invariablement des changements profonds dans l 'équilibre social intellectuel ou moral, ainsi que dans l'évolution des techniques et des arts. II s'établit donc naturellement dans toute civilisation liée à une ethnie particulière des mécanismes de résistance qui tendent à empêcher l'intrusion d'elements étrangers quelle qu'en soit la valeur. C'est à cause de ces mécanismes de résistance qu'en dépit des contacts et des échanges qui existent aujourd'hui entre les peuples, les nations, les continents, certains domaines de la culture ou de la pensée dans les diverses civilisations du monde demeurent herméti- quement clos. Leur ouverture à des influences extérieures pourrait, dans certains cas, provoquer un choc salutaire, dans d'autres cas des désastres imprevisibles. Le contact avec la musique occidentale classique et moderne, dans des pays tels que le Japon, a conduit à une profonde réorientation des ac- tivités musicales. Mais dans ce cas il a été possible d'éviter la destruction complète de l'art musical autochthone. Dans d'autres pays, le contact avec la musique européenne a provoqué une désorientation sans contre-partie positive et a conduit à une décadence générale des valeurs. C'est qu'il n'a pas été possible d'arriver dans des pays moins évolués que le Japon à une juxtaposition des cultures, et que les éléments étrangers injectés dans la culture locale n'étaient pas assimilables. L'un des principaux problèmes du contexte musical de notre temps est de préserver les grandes traditions musicales et les chefs-d'oeuvre créés dans leurs idiomes particuliers en évitant des hybridations malheureuses. Nous pouvons aujourd'hui apprécier également la musique de la Renaissance dans sa forme la plus authen- tique et la musique contemporaine, bien qu'il s'agisse de conceptions de la musique profondément différentes. Ceci n'était pas possible au siècle dernier où l'on arrangeait au goût du jour les ceuvres anciennes. II s'agit donc maintenant pour nous d'étendre a d'autres formes de musique ce droit à la coexistence. Ceci n'est possible que par une meilleure compréhension des valeurs d'art authentiques telles qu'elles apparaissent dans le contexte particulier de chacune des diverses cultures.

Abstract : Several of the many works of absorbing interest by present day Rumanian composers I was able to hear, either in concert performances or from tapes bear witness to this characteristic - for example, in Theodor Grigoriu's "Hommage à Enesco" a polyphonic tour de force for 32 violins di- vided into 4 groups, and in works by Vieru, this year's prizewinner of the Concours Reine Marie José in Switzerland. Composers in present day Rumania are obviously well-informed about all modern trends. The admixture of Enesco-based traditionalism and post-Webernian serialism or even pointil- lisme has given rise to some truly challenging works (young composers such as Tiberiu Olah, Aurel Stroe, Cornel Tsaranu, Wilhelm Berger - prizewinner of the Prince Rainier Contest - and Liviu Glode- vol. 7, 1965 (6) vol. 7, 1965 (4-5)</page><page sequence="308">326 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) anu). Although seemingly less exposed to the more recent "Western" trends, Bulgarian composers - the conductor Constantin Iliev writes some of the most "advanced" - are equally well-treated when it comes to state - support and popularity. In both countries, the state support - given through the Union of Composers - takes the highly practical form of all kinds of incentives to write music undeterred, at least momentarily, by the necessity for earning a living - commissions, free residence in "creative centers" invariably situated in the most beautiful and remote parts of the country, publication and the certainty of performance. The popularity results from the opportunity which the public is thus given of becoming acquainted with and interested in the work of its contemporaries. • Horst Friedrich Mayer: "48 Länder - Eine Sprache: Der 19.

Abstract : In the succeeding years, an increasing number of radio stations joined the Rostrum, and with the increase, the system in operation became unwieldy and sometimes awkward. In 1959, the group at- tending the meeting - 16 stations - decided to combine the two schemes - "The Rostrum" and "Selec- tion of Contemporary Works" - into a single system which retained the essential elements of each but which would be more flexible, and also to prolong the duration of the meetings from 3 to 5 days. Since 1959, the procedure, with a few minor changes each year, has been the following: the participants from the various countries have brought to the Paris meeting 40 minutes of outstanding contemporary music of all categories on tape or records, accompanied by scores and commentaries. During the days of the meeting, all the participants listen to all the music presented. In the course of the following season each station is automatically committed to broadcasting a minimum of six of the works presented at the meeting; the work may be presented by a "live" performance or on tape obtained from the originating country. The participants are free to choose any six works from the total performed. Quite independent vol. 7, 1965 (3)</page><page sequence="309">2.

Abstract : So many of the younger composers are themselves performers that one can almost speak of a "school" of composer-performers. An important area of work in the United States today concerns the whole question of improvisation. There are a number of composers (the so-called "third stream" led by Gunther Schuller) who are working on the relationship between avant-garde jazz and new compo- sitional ideas and the work of composers like Schuller, Larry Austin and Bill Smith approaches very closely that of jazzmen like Omette Coleman, Jimmy Giuffre, Lalo Schiffrin and John Lewis. Other composers have been working on improvisation in a strictly non-jazz context: notably the California group around Robert Erickson. The growth of a whole new generation of extraordinarily gifted young performers (not to mention a gifted young public) has played an important role in the development of all this new music which - if one can generalize - is, at once, tangible and full of fantasy, controlled and yet free, created out of the realities of musical performance and yet stamped with the personality of the creator. The range of techniques is enormous; for younger composers like Gordon Mumma and Robert Ashley in Michigan or James Tenney and Malcolm Goldstein in New York, the old battles - the old antagonisms and exclusivities - are finished. All of the new techniques: microphones, tape, instru- mental virtuosity and extremes of every kind, asymmetrical or cyclical, periodic forms, fixed and free, mathematical and psychological forms - all are possible; it is only the way they are used that counts!

Abstract: Some 400 composers, directors, designers, etc. from 40 countries attended this International Congress. Nearly all sessions displayed a common tendency to diverge from what was, strictly speak- ing, the specific subject under discussion at the moment. The "opera" - this many-headed monster which the congress was out to "tame" - is an enormously complicated and complex affair. The Sunday morning session on "Experience of Oriental Theatres" brought a new and extremely interesting note to the Congress. With Narayana Menon (India) as chairman, examples of Indian dance-drama and Japa- nese Noh (introduced by Shigeo Kishibe (Japan) were seen on film; and a fascinating live performance of Vietnamese traditional theatre was presented by Trän Van Khê. Alain Daniélou (France) remarked that the musical theatres of Asia present a prodigious variety in the conception, structure, instruments, rhythms, developments and improvisation and suggested that Occidental music could learn much from them. The synthesis of singing, speaking, mime, dance and reciting does indeed achieve a kind of "total theatre" which is highly sophisticated and complicated on the one hand and strikingly simple on the vol. 7,1965(1) vol. 6, 1964 (5-6)</page><page sequence="311">2.

Abstract : Representatives of radio organizations from 25 countries participated in the 10th annual meeting of the International Rostrum of Composers at UNESCO House, Paris, in May 1964. Each representative brought with him 40 minutes of music recorded on tape by contemporary composers, mainly of his own country. The meetings lasted five days, during which all of the music (81 works) was listened to by all of the representatives. Each participating station is committed to broadcasting during the 1964/1965 season a minimum of six of the 81 works presented. At the end of the meetings, the representatives voted on the works listened to in order to select those which they considered to have the greatest artistic merit. The International Music Council seeks to promote the works distinguished in this manner by bringing them to the attention of the non-participating stations, recording companies and concert-giving societies. • Ross Lee Finney: "International Rostrum of Composers," 122. Abstract : It is stimulating to sit on a committee that responds most warmly to those scores from coun- tries that have best resisted the domination of the musically reactionary, to those composers who have avoided both the cliché of the avant-garde and the sterility of the academic. The members of the Ros- trum are not fooled, I think, by the musical politics that attempts to forward interests of publishers or of pressure groups. The Rostrum is for the young, and has little interest in forwarding the cause of the well-established composer. Its main concern is for quality, but it hopes to find quality in the new. The keynote was hit for me by our chairman who said, when we had to listen to a work for which there was no score that we would have to "listen by heart." • Roman Jasinski: "Tribune international des compositeurs," 122 (in French only).

Articles • Mario Labroca: "Message from Mario Labroca, President of the International Music Council," 79-80 (incl. French transi). Abstract : It has become something of a truism that music life in Germany is particularly active and respected, supported and well-organized, but I should like to take this occasion to say that this is truer to-day than ever. Much credit for this must go to the German National Music Committee. Under the active and forward-looking presidency of Prof. Dr. Hans Mersmann, many admirable projects, such as aiding young artists, improving music education, aiding composers, making Germany's new music known on records, have been achieved. It is, in short, a broadly representative, effectively organized and productive national music committee - a model of its kind. This issue of "the world of music " will give you a glimpse of some of the achievements of the committee and I hope that other national com- mittees may profit from the example. • Hans Mersmann: "Music Life in Germany and the German Music Council," 80-84 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Compared with the cultural life of other European countries, music in Germany is to a great extent decentralized. In the first place there is the fateful division of our country. But decentralization is characteristic even of Western Germany taken by itself; we lack a capital city. Decentralization leads to the exertion of individual talents to the uttermost and the best possible distribution of the resultant achievements throughout the country. The Federal Republic possesses some fifty opera houses and more than double that number of orchestras. These figures bear witness to a wealth of production. All this activity reflects a powerful internal dynamic which is probably most clearly recognizable in the field of opera. The same somewhat applies to the major part of our concerts: contemporary music has not yet its appropriate share in the daily concert programs and remains the affair of rather small and exclusive circles. The type of the big orchestral concert with an audience of regulars has kept its place. In those towns in which the radio stations run their own orchestras, there is often an ideal competitive situation. In this competition the municipal symphony orchestras sometimes show a certain tendency towards tradition, whilst the radio is able to allow itself famous guest conductors and every kind of ar- tistic experiment. Exchanges with foreign countries have taken a dimension hitherto unknown even in the case of our bigger orchestras, like the Berlin Philharmonic, Bamberg Symphony, Hamburg Philhar- monic, Munich Philharmonic, the Gürzenich Orchestra of Cologne, the Württemberg State Orchestra and others. • Ernst Thomas: "Contemporary German Music," 85-87 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract'. The German musical life of the present, the contemporary German music, lost three impor- tant composers at the end of the past year, Paul Hindemith, Karl Amadeus Hartmann, and Winfried Zillig. In 1965 Hindemith would have been 70 years old, Hartmann and Zillig each 60. Only separated by ten years these composers, however, represented two generations of the new German music: Hin- demith the first generation which placed him in the international position along with Schönberg, Bartok and Stravinsky (the only survivor); Hartmann and Zillig the so-called second generation of new music which was given a particular role in the special course of German music history, namely to recognize, to treasure and to transmit that which twelve years of cultural barbarism in Germany had destroyed.

Contents and Abstracts • 331 in a double freedom: a political, ideological freedom and a freedom from aesthetic restrictions, factors which have made their development difficult but at the same time fruitful. In this short discussion, two things will be attempted. First there will be a consideration of the various generations of composers. At the same time there will be an attempt made to answer the question, which confronts contemporary music in Germany, "How does one compose in free Germany today?" In this relationship a symptom- atic and restrictive conclusion should be mentioned in advance, that is: the development of music es- pecially in the last two decades does not admit of a consideration of contemporary music on the basis of geographic borders. • Siegfried Boris: "Contemporary Music Theater in Germany," 88-93 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : For more than a century opera in Germany has had a steadily rising importance not only in the musical life itself, but in its social implications as well. In West Germany alone there are today more than seventy theaters with regular opera programs and their own operatic ensembles. The fact that since the beginning of the century more than 400 new operas have been premiered might be regarded as an indication of a kind of opera fanaticism that is unique. In most countries which have a national opera tradition: France, England, Austria, Poland, etc. the opera as an art form has retained a certain exclusive social function derived from feudal times as well as the romantic era, and as a result has been restricted to the major cities and residences. However, in Germany the operatic activities have long since been incorporated into the cultural plans and art life of the cities in general. Even small cities give astound- ingly large subventions year after year in order to bring important artists and an interesting program to their opera houses. The large number of German opera houses indicates the deep desire of the German citizen to experience, in the opera, a musical projection of his imagery. • Günther Noll: "Concert Life in Germany," 94-100 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The inner structure of the German concert world may be gathered from programs. Naturally the great works of the world repertoire and the German repertoire make up the main part. After 1945 contact was quickly made with international music. International festivals bear witness to the efforts made to establish friendly relations between nations. A run through the list of annual festivals in Ger- many will be the best way of giving an idea of the varied nature of the whole: International May Festi- val Wiesbaden; Schwetzingen Festival; International Bach Festival; Munich Festival; Mozart Festival Würzburg; International Music Festival Konstanz; International Organ Festival Nuremberg; European Festival in Passau; Festival of New Music organized by Radio Hessen in connection with the Interna- tional Holiday Courses for New Music in Darmstadt; Göttingen Handel Festival; Wagner Festival Bay- reuth; Berlin Festival; Kassel Festival; Donaueschingen Festival for Contemporary Music and many others. A further characteristic of concert life is the tendency in the direction of the moderns. The forces which gathered to the banner of New Music brought about the gradual acceptance of the principle that no concert should be without a piece of contemporary music, and this was achieved by no means only in the large cities: traditions once responsible for a flourishing musical culture both in the small towns and also in the old Residences have here allowed the transition to a modern concert life which is some- times even more open to novelties than is that of the city. • Egon Kraus: "Music in the Life and Education of Youth and Adults," 101-02 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Communal music making, both vocal and instrumental, has never lost its social and educa- tional power in Germany. Choral singing and instrumental music have had a rich tradition for centuries. The 17.000 secular choirs, the much higher number of church choirs, and the innumerable amateur musicians organized in bands, orchestras and small instrumental ensembles add up to an imposing and surprisingly large total number of active amateurs, without even counting the many people who make music by themselves or in private groups. Amateur music is even more actively cultivated in the country and in the towns, as a result of its strong connection with folklore and local customs, especially in the South, but even in the towns there are signs that the urge to sing has remained alive, when for example, hundreds of people assemble for public singing regularly from month to month, as happens</page><page sequence="314">332 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) in many towns, sometimes in connection with a radio station. The revival of old music brought a new lease of life to the amateur music making. Many new editions of old music were published. The result of better acquaintance with the standards of older masters was an ever more urgent call for new music. During the last four decades, composers of various stylistic directions have written a great deal of valu- able and challenging music for amateurs which has today become just as much a part of the repertoire as are the works of past epochs. • Walter Wiora: "Musicology," 103-06 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract. Chrysander had urged that the whole area of music, not only the historical, be considered, and Adler stressed that "research of the development and recognition of the nature of music" must cooperatively support each other. Despite this and despite Hugo Riemann 's determination to combine historical and systematic musicology the historical aspect assumed the greatest role. Through team- work the critical-philological editions came into existence, the necessary source material for a positive science: Complete works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, and other masters, the "Denkmäler der Tonkunst" in Germany, Austria, Bavaria, and later in their place the "Erbe Deutscher Musik." Through special research in various periods, countries and genres important advances were achieved, as for example the middle ages by Friedrich Ludwig, Johannes Wolf and others, the opera by Kretzschmar, Abert and others, knowledge of instruments by Curt Sachs, etc. At the same time psychology of music and other areas of systematic musicology developed under the studies of advanced researchers such as Carl Stumpf. A center for ethnological and comparative research was brought into existence in Berlin thanks to Carl Stumpf's initiative, represented actually by Curt Sachs, Robert Lachmann, Georg Schíinemann and M. von Hornbostel. At the Berlin University such men as Abert, Wolf, Friedländer, von Hornbos- tel, Sachs, Moser, Schíinemann, Blume and others were teaching in the famous decade of the 1920's. This was a memorable climate of development. National socialism was also a disastrous movement for musicology. Old and young researchers such as Hornbostel, Sachs, Einstein, Gombosi, Bukofzer had to emigrate. In the catastrophe of the Second World War many researchers died and countless es- tablishments and collections were damaged or completely destroyed. To this was added the loss of the valuable libraries and institutes of the eastern lands such as those in Breslau, Königsberg, and other cit- ies. The journals disappeared, the central research institute was broken up, and the organization of the special field was dissolved. In 1 945 there seemed to be a complete disintegration of what had been built up through years of toil. In a surprisingly short time, despite difficult circumstances, the restoration was accomplished. For this the courage and skill of Friedrich Blume, Hans Albrecht, and Karl Vötterle are to be thanked. By 1946 the Society for Musical Research was reorganized in Kiel and in 1947 it was constituted as the special organization of German musicology at a conference in Göttingen. In 1 948 the first scientific Congress was held, and in the same year the journal "Die Musikforschung" appeared. Today there is at least a professorship and an Institute for Musicology at every university of the Ger- man Federal Republic. It is true that division into special areas and the appearance of unimportant con- siderations are continuing dangers, but efforts are made to combat these tendencies in different ways. A magnificent compendium of today's scientific treasury is Blume 's encyclopedia "Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart" (Music in History and the Present). There are attempts on the part of some research- ers to combine historic, systematic, and ethnological aspects to base them anew in the real manner of a "comparative" method which would go far beyond the area of ethnology. Music history is growing beyond the limitations of the western world to a universal historical presentation of the course of music from its prehistoric beginnings to its position in present day industrial society.

Abstract : This year marks the fifteenth birthday of the International Music Council. I have been hon- ored to be elected and re-elected president for six of these years, and I have naturally been closely as- sociated with most of the projects and plans. On this occasion I should like to express in print some of my wishes for the future, in the hope that they may eventually be realized with the aid of our member organizations, with the aid of our parent organization, UNESCO, and, perhaps - why not? - some of the cultural foundations in various parts of the world. What do we want to happen in the development of the IMC? Where is it going? Where should it go? I think one should begin by being frankly unre- alistic - by dreaming the impossible, and then, a little later, one must become realistic and attack the most reasonable tasks, leading to the more difficult ones. Eventually, the impossible will be achieved. Or very likely will be. I believe that the IMC, while consolidating its position in the countries where it is already active, should seek to expand geographically to bring into the family representatives from more of the Latin American countries and from some of the newly-formed and developing countries of Africa, as well as from some of the Asian countries which are not yet represented in the Council.

Abstract We were deeply impressed by the reverent interest in music and dance on the part of concert, ballet and opera audiences, which everywhere included a high proportion of what, were obviously non-intellectuals. In no country have we seen such consistently packed houses for the best kind of music, nor such crowded museums. We had, of course, heard of the great attention being given to the dissemination of contemporary music, and the means available to the USC and its affiliated unions in the various republics are indeed considerable. It would appear that the policy encouraging the closest contact between artists - both creative and interpretative - on the one hand and the public - in town and country, factory and farm - on the other, is bearing fruit. And it is significant that even the most eminent composers and their chosen interpreters frequently travel deep into the provinces to perform their works and talk about their craft. The interchange between musicians of the various republics in the form of "decades" of, for example, Russian music in Armenia or Estonian music in Azerbaidjan is a powerful means of mutual appreciation between the very different cultures of the member nations of the Soviet Union. I was told that a small number of Soviet composers of the younger generation are writing in the dodecaphonic idiom but that their works are popular neither with the public nor with their fellow composers.

Abstract: With the announcement in Vienna on Friday 15th November, 1963, of the three prize-win- ning works in the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde - International Music Council, International Com- position Contest, one of the most unusual music projects has been completed. The story goes back to the end of 1960, when Dr. Hryn-tschak and Prof. Gamsjager, respectively President and Secretary general of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (G. d. M.) - Society of the Friends of Music - of Vienna, came to Paris to request the Director General of UNESCO to give the Organization's auspices to the celebrations which were to mark the 150th anniversary of the creation of the society in 1812. Simply a patronage, with no special intervention on the part of UNESCO, seemed pointless; it was therefore decided, at the suggestion of the International Music Council, to organize jointly for this occasion, under the auspices of UNESCO, some event which would help contemporary composers. The event vol. 5, 1963 (6)</page><page sequence="317">2. Contents and Abstracts • 335 finally decided upon represents a completely new form of composition contest. It was inspired partly by our International Rostrum of Composers' success in having new works circulated through radio organizations and partly by the way in which the International Music Fund has implemented the late Serge Koussevitzky's efforts in behalf of contemporary composers. Major orchestras from all countries ( 1 57 in all) were invited to enter one orchestral work by a living composer, new to the orchestra's reper- toire. The work submitted was to be for normal symphony orchestra without soloist and of a maximum duration of 30 minutes. It must have been performed by the participating orchestra in a public concert during the 1961 - 1962 season. The score and as far ^s possible, a tape (or record) of the work selected was to reach the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Agreements were reached both with the International Federation of Musicians and the American Federation of Musicians by which each work could be re- corded by the orchestra which entered it. • J.H. Kwabena Nketia: "Traditional and Contemporary Idioms of African Music," 1 32- 33. Abstract : Until a few decades ago, the musical picture in many parts of Africa was primarily that of tra- ditions of linguistic groups as cultural units. So there was as now Akan music, Adangme music, Yoruba music, and Kalahari music etc., each one practiced by communities sharing common beliefs, common values and common ideals. Because of the way in which this music was organized and practiced in the past, striking variations in levels of attainment, in the emphasis on different instrumental resources, and more particularly in the choice of singing styles have been inevitable. Thus when we compare the sing- ing styles of the Akan and the Anlo-Ewe of Ghana, we find that the dominant features of Akan singing style are the use of a heptatonic scale and polyphony based on the third as a consonant interval. Men and women rarely sing in octave parallels. In Ewe singing, on the other hand, the predominant features are singing in unison or in parallel octaves where men and women sing together and the use of sporadic fourths as consonant intervals. Both hemitonic and a-hemitonic pentatonic forms are used. The sing- ing styles of the two groups are typical of the styles of other African peoples. The common features shared by the different musical traditions of African peoples have now been broadly defined, notably by Waterman, Merriam and others. They include a bundle of rhythmic characteristics with a fairly wide distribution, such as the use of both divisive and additive rhythms, in particular the use of durational ratios of two against three and internal accentual grouping of motifs in twos and threes against a steady pulse which may be articulated in some kind of bodily movement. The application of these principles to linear or multilinear structures gives rise to what has been variously described as polyrhythm, cross- rhythm, polymeter, shifting meters, multiple main beats, interlocking rhythms, and so forth. There are of course other distinctive features such as the common emphasis on percussion and on the use of a limited number of techniques such as ostinato and the hocket, particularly in instrumental forms. The musical specializations within these traditions generally tend to be social, historical or functional in character rather than "idiomatic." The same idiom may be the basis of court music, occasional music, cult music and recreational music except where peculiar historical circumstances giving rise for ex- ample to admixture of peoples of different cultural units bring in marked stylistic differentiations.

Abstract : Impossible en quelques lignes de faire ne serait ce qu'une allusion a toutes les idées ingénieu- ses, à toutes les suggestions uliles qui ont été exprimées. Retenons-en un désir sincère, et plus qu'un désir, un besoin, de mobiliser toutes les énergies, toutes les ressources des diverses cultures pour en faire bénéficier l 'éducation musicale.

Abstract : Israel seems to have been a propitious choice for a meeting of this kind and character. From time immemorial, this country on the Eastern Mediterranean shores has been a bridgehead between East and West, between ancient tradition and modern spirit. Once mediating between the cultures of the Eastern countries and the rising West, the traffic of mediation, absorption and acculturation now goes both ways. The steadily-rising population of Israel absorbs newcomers from almost every country of the world, and thus the impact is felt of Western modernism (in technique as well as in art) on ancient traditions as much as those thousand-year-old heritages leave their mark on the living and creative ac- tivities of Westerners making Israel their new home. "We are generally regarded as the East End of the West and as the West End of the East," remarked Israel's own eminent musician Frank Pelleg wittily and rightly when opening the first session of the Congress, the theme of which was "Regional versus universal trends in music." The sessions were held in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and among the subjects discussed were "Ethical and Aesthetical Criteria of Value in Music Today," "Preservation and Renewal of Folk and Traditional Music," "Folk and Traditional Music as a Creative Element in Modern Music," "Polyphony in Folk and Art Music," "Liturgies of Orient and Occident," "Improvisa- tion and Ornamentation in Eastern and Western Music," and "Problems of Notation." • Jean Jenkins: "Report on the Sixteenth Conference of the International Folk Music Council Held in Jerusalem, Israel, August 1963," 108-09. Abstract : Implicit in the discussions was another problem; there are musicologists concerned with Western classical music, and others concerned with the folk music of Europe and Africa. Musicolo- gists working in the field of Eastern music, however, are concerned solely with the highly developed art music of the various areas. The folk music of the East is neither studied nor recorded. Yet the need for work in this field is greater than in many others, for radio, television, and films are taking their inevitable toll. Art music, with its higher status, may survive; the folk music is changing and disap- pearing so quickly that the next few years are vital if any of the original folk music is to be preserved and studied.

Abstract : Delegates of radio organizations from twenty-six countries attended the ninth annual meeting of the International Rostrum of Composers at UNESCO House from May 27th to 3 1 st for the purpose of the exchange of contemporary music. Founded in 1954 by the International Music Council, this scheme began with only four countries participating and increased from twenty-one countries last year to twenty-six in 1963. Each delegate brought with him scores and tapes of forty-five minutes of the most noteworthy contemporary works presented during the past year over his station. During the five days of the meetings the entire group listened to a total of eighty-nine works (twenty hours of listen- ing). During the 1963 - 1964 season each station is committed to broadcast a minimum of six works from other countries from the list of Rostrum works. • Gyorg Kroo: Organe idéal de l'échange de la musique contemporaine," 83. • Tage Níeslon: "International Rostrum of Composers - The Most Valuable Forum for the Exchange of New Music," 83-84. • Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt: "The Rostrum of Composers - A Living Idea," 84. • Brigitte Schiffer: "Music: East and West," 85-86. Abstract: The Oriental origin of Western music and Western instruments is well known today. It is therefore all the more surprising that Westerners should find such difficulty in enjoying Oriental music and that Easterners should feel such reluctance when confronted with the classical symphony. These same Oriental listeners seem to find an easier approach to contemporary works of European music, and European audiences, on the other hand, who have given up their traditional habits of listening, are more and more attracted, and even to a certain extent influenced, by the music of the East. We will now try to outline, how such a close relationship during the Middle-Ages should result in such a complete estrangement and how a new mutual and universal understanding is coming about nowadays. In order to give evidence of the Oriental origin of Occidental music, we only have to examine the instruments of both civilizations. There remains no doubt that most of the European instruments have come from the Near-East and the iconography of the European Middle- Ages provides ample proof and illustra- vol. 5, 1963 (4)</page><page sequence="320">338 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) tion for it. If we examine Islamic carved woods, tiles and miniatures, drawings and sculptures, and if we compare them with early Western documents, we meet exactly the same instruments. The nay and the mizmar , the tabi turki and the tabi baladi, the naqqara and the rebab , the üd, qanün , santïr and nafir are found again in Europe under the name of flute and oboe, bass-drum and side- or tenor-drum, kettledrum and vielle, lute , medicinale, p s alt er ion, trumpet and trombone. Moreover we find the same "ensembles," consisting of a few instruments of completely different character, such as one wind, one bowed, one plucked and one percussion instrument, a combination which we can come across in Cairo still now any day, and which stands for a certain sound ideal in which colors, instead of mixing, stand out against each other, an ideal clearly designed to allow the recognition of each specific voice, an ideal, therefore, of polyphonic music. Moreover, even the sound color and music practice, the style of performing as such must have been closely related because when we look at such pictures as "Singing Angels from the Ghent Altar" by Hubert (1366 - 1426) and Jan van Eyck (1380 - 1440) or "Group of Singers from the Cantoria" by Luca della Robbia (1400 - 1482) we notice that the muscles at the root of the nose are contracted as is the case with nasal, i.e. Oriental voice production. The ftoratura (zawaid, tahasin, zuwwaq ) which are the "life and soul" of Oriental music in general and of Oriental singing in particular, and which consisted, according to Henry George Farmer, of shakes, grace notes, the drawled scales, appogiatura and the tarkïb, are also part of mediaeval European music practice and provide that additional dimension, which, at a certain time, will be replaced in Western music by har- mony. Western audiences, accustomed to listen to chords, to concentrate on harmonies, are therefore not only unprepared but even unable to follow, appreciate and enjoy an art of filigree, which occupies such an important place in Islamic art of all kinds.

Articles • Anon.: "Introduction: International Congress on Music and Its Public, Rome, September 27th-30th, 1962," 3. • Firmino Sifonia: "Report of the Meetings," 4-10 (incl. French transi.). Abstract The general, introductory paper of the President of the International Music Council, Mario Labroca, rich in its suggestions and with a breadth growing naturally from his broad experience, builds up between the opening sentence: "The history of music is also the history of the relations which exist between music and its public," and the concluding sentence: "This Congress reflects the preoccupa- tions of all those who have at heart the cause of music." On the one hand, the idea of the breadth and fullness desired for this Congress, and on the other, the consciousness of the innumerable and difficult problems faced by musicians today to insure reasonable perspectives for their art. It is between these two poles that the Congress multiplied its analyses and stated firmly its conclusions, as we shall soon see (Firmino Sifonia). • Mario Labroca: "Allocution Présidentielle," 12. I: The Public Abstract. The definition of the term "public" - an apparently elementary concept - gave rise to many pertinent observations. To begin with, it was pointed out that the music public of today is not a ho- mogeneous unit. People often complain of not having a public, but what sort of public is meant? It is probably necessary to be more specific and not to speak of public in the singular but of publics in the plural. This means also there is not one music but musics. The new technical media demand of us still another distinction: that between the traditional public and the record public, for example. Records do</page><page sequence="322">340 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) not have a public in the sense in which opera and concerts create and sustain one. Records do not play any "community" role. Performers and musicologists go to make up this public, alongside the non- professionals and men of good will. In the Orient we observe there the problem of a society which has seen the "de-functionalizing" of its traditional music; the problem of a democratization of this music as well as an invasion by Occidental art - some of it of value and other of distinctly less cultural value. The variety of the situations is extreme: in India, for example, the transformation is taking place with impressive speed; the changes in the way of life and in ways of thinking among the population af- fect to a considerable degree musical performance, styles of performing and even the structure of the music. An Occidental public for the music of the Orient is a category which really does not exist. But this public should be created, for we shall only truly understand the other cultures, we shall only truly have contact with the Asian countries to the extent that we shall know how to enlarge our public and learn to understand their music - more important even than their language - for if we understand the music which moves someone, we shall more truly understand what he is and what he feels. One of the surprises of this Congress was that it made a first-rate contribution to the study of a problem, namely that of education. It follows perfectly naturally that one must think now of the training for tomorrow of an intelligent public unless one wishes to risk a complete rupture between music and musical life. This education should not be at all a one-way affair: it should encourage the pupil to play music and provide him with basic knowledge which would enable him to become familiar with the masterpieces of all time, in order to form his judgment and his taste. The potential public for music is the whole of humanity.

II: The Programme Abstract: Music has become "de-fiinctionalized;" it has become a pure art, gratuitous, a concert art. It is almost exclusively for an extremely limited elite that the "Musée sonore" reveals its treasures of time</page><page sequence="323">2. Contents and Abstracts • 341 and space, but the works, for the majority of them, are limited to a restricted number of catalogued mas- terpieces. In the struggle between the music "art de culture" and the music "art de masse," these institu- tions are content to confirm the converted in their satisfaction of being among the elect and to delight them in the refinement of their pleasures. Consequently, the problem which arises is to try, in the world of music of cultural value, to make these existing institutions play their role of "Musées sonores" as broadly and fully as possible and also their role of fermentation in the perpetual renewal of music. But one comes up against the obstacle, unfortunately, that music is strangely disfavored in a society which opens the doors wide to the literature and fine arts of its time but in which the great majority cares for nothing but music one or two hundred years old. In opera, the situation is not very different. Certain composers even lose entire contact with the listener; they ignore the social significance of music and remain indifferent to the great subjects and feelings which today inspire the peoples of the world. As for the opera repertoire, it would be desirable to modernize certain aspects of conceptions of staging. It is interesting to hear a defense of certain choices and preferences of these record manufacturers in compiling their general programs. It would be completely inaccurate, for example, to think that (1) the inherent, cultural, educational value of "classical" music is always greater than that of light music; or (2) that the taste for "serious" music existed in the public before being "destroyed" by listening to light or "popular" music (Stewart). Such an attitude seems to introduce a rather new slant in a contro- versy which certainly does not date from today. The critic, a genuine intermediary between music and its public, between the program and the listener, has the important role of communicating explicitly, through literary means, poetry and eloquence, what is implicit in the musical work.

III: The Organization of Professional Musical Life Abstract : The solution to the problem of the organization of musical life is to be sought in farsighted vision aimed not at the (real or actual) public of today but at the (real) public of tomorrow. A new sort of organization will be needed for the latter public - one which seeks to realize as best as possible a service for the whole population and which considers the presentation of music to the public exclu- sively as a means of documenting a work of art, a cultural public service of the same sort as museums and libraries. One should consider the organization of musical life as a cultural, unitary fact, consisting of four independent structures: publishing, recording, radio, and television broadcasting, and public performance. Within the governmental systems of today one can point out a few interesting character- istics: in the USSR, for example, the school and social organizations actively try to prepare composers to face the realities of existence. On their own initiative, many of the best composers travel across the country, without limiting their visits to the great traditional auditoriums of the large cities. In the United States, the universities, colleges and schools give series of concerts, some semi-professional, some pro- fessional. In most of the educational institutions a small part of the tuition fees paid by each student is allocated to the concert series. The economic question, in all its forms, is, of course, one of the essential points of any system. The question of subsidies is, naturally, an eternal one, and certain statistics show that only about 2% of the population in some cities where musical life is most active are actually sub- scribers to a cycle of concerts. Since the subsidies which are provided for opera, on the other hand, are usually insufficient, the management must always make certain commercial concessions which prevent the opera house from playing its role as a "Musée sonore" to the fullest extent. More than the concert</page><page sequence="324">342 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) hall, the opera house is limited to an extremely small repertoire. It does not welcome new works or experimentation and it is often forced to submit masterpieces to the domination - or better, perhaps, the caprices - of the more commercial-minded stars. To transform this economic mechanism into a more modern system, it would perhaps be better to reject the principle of subsidy - which has the unfortunate disadvantage, among others, of reducing the musician's role to that of a perpetual money-seeker - and in its stead, to arrange that both the public and the state, each according to its economic possibilities, pay for music.

IV: The Organization of Amateur Musical Life Abstract : The problems of amateur musicians also find their place within the general framework of organization, for, if one wishes to combat the always strong temptation to remain a passive listener to music, more attention must be given to this field. One may therefore conclude by stating that there is a necessity for making some decisions, for it is urgent to begin to take action to create a new, modernized organization: the evolution of musical thought, of technical media, of society in general, is so rapid and so deep that it becomes increasingly difficult to adapt the present system of organization to the demands of production.

Abstract : This is the fundamental problem of modern music today, in its relationship to the general public. For better or for worse, ours has become largely an "antiquarian" culture in the sense of ac- cumulation, of cherishing and performing all the great (and much of the less-great) music of the past three hundred years. Today's "music lover" is brought up on Bach, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schu- bert, Brahms, Tschaikowsky and jazz. The music of all these masters, and of jazz, has certain elements in common, despite the enormous dissimilarities of aesthetic and idiom. It is based on the harmonic system, employs regular meters with regularly-recurring strong and weak beats and is couched in melodic terms that we may call "singable." The vast majority of musically-minded persons has been conditioned to expect these elements in music. When, as in much modern music, they are not present in their accustomed forms, the listener is apt to be lost, baffled and resentful. There is little to be gained by berating the "stupid public" for its backwardness in refusing to accept modern music or for upbraid- ing composers for writing it. Both are doing, in a sense, what they have to do - the composer through inner necessity, the public through conditioning. There is cause for alarm, however, at the situation and at the results. We live in an age of mass communication, with its enormous, hitherto un-dreamed-of cultural possibilities. And it is regrettable that of the millions of potential listeners to the music of the twentieth century only a very few feel sympathetic towards it or able to follow it. For many, music ends with Richard Strauss and Ravel; for a few with Stravinsky and Schönberg. But the tempo of stylistic change has been so accelerated in our century that these "radical" composers of yesterday - who have not yet been generally "digested" and accepted by audiences of today - are already "old-fashioned" as compared with the post-war avant-garde: Boulez, Stockhausen, Nono, Berio, Pousseur, Penderecki, Ligeti, et al. These are names that are known only to a very small number of initiates and whose music is almost never heard in a "normal" subscription concert. (The reasons are clear: not only would their music frighten the "normal" subscription audience back to Beethoven and Tchaikovsky; it is also much too difficult to be adequately rehearsed in the time most orchestras have at their disposal; and it requires more "learning" time than most conductors are willing to spend.) • John Evarts: "Highlights of the 'Semaines Musicales Internationales de Paris' - 1962," 125-26 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The most important of the events which took place within the framework of the "Semaines Musicales Internationales de Paris" was an international round-table discussion on the topic of "Do the New Musical Forms Constitute a Social Phenomenon?" The discussions took place at the Cercle Inter- Allie in Paris and at the Abbaye de Royaumont. During the festival weeks there was an exhibition on "Music in Denmark - and French Influences on Danish Music" at Denmark House in Paris. Initiated in 1958 by the International Music Council, in collaboration with the French National Music Committee and the French Association of Concert Managers, the "Semaines Musicales Internationales de Paris" have this year become a permanent and official institution, supported by the Ministry of Cultural Af- fairs, the City of Paris and the Department de la Seine.

Three public lectures and four symposiums formed the scientific part of the Congress and attempted to define the life of a music li- brarian: his professional training, his relations with the public, his international role, his administrative functions, the buildings in which he works. Taking advantage of the presence in Stockholm of many of its members, the Executive Board of the I.A. M. L. had also convened all the international working commissions: those of the RISM, of the catalogue code, record libraries, radio music libraries, and doc- umentation. Since these commissions were able to hold several meetings in Stockholm, they were able to accomplish a lot of useful work. Two other organizations held their assemblies at the same time as the Congress of the I.A.M.L.: the Scandinavian musicologists, who were holding their 4th Congress, and the Music Information Centers (MIC), which met for the third time and, on this occasion, reached the important decision of becoming an International Working Commission within the I.A.M.L. • Donald Shetler: "The Salzburg Opera Prize and the Congress on 'Music in Television'," 101-02 (incl.

Abstract : Representatives from radio organizations of 21 countries participated. In the series of festi- vals of contemporary music which, in the course of the year, take place in all the countries, the "Inter- national Rostrum of Composers," convened at UNESCO every spring, has a character all of its own. Two score men come to the Rostrum from the four corners of the world with their bags full of goods and their hearts full of conviction, to exchange their materials and confirm their faith. Before each piece is listened to, biographical notes on the composers and analytical notes on the works and scores are distributed. And, better than on other occasions, we are shown at the Rostrum that the music today is, as old Fontenelle would say, an interesting plurality of worlds. The Rostrum ends with a selection and a vote. So, at the final meeting, the participants vote to consecrate on the most interesting scores. The results of the voting at this year's meeting were as follows: Most distinguished work: "España en el corazón," by the Italian composer Luigi Nono. Other works also honored were by Lewis Carroll, Niccolo Castiglioni, and Akira Miyoshi. • Narayana Menon: "Indian Music Today," 76-78 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : There has been a widening of horizons, and along with it, perhaps a dilution of ideas and values. But there is no doubt that there is more good music to be heard in India today and performed publicly than at any other time in our history. There are better and larger audiences. Listening is more intelligent, more critical. There is, in the country as a whole, a renewed awareness of our musical heri- tage, and a just pride in it. There is also a new generation of musicians growing up - musicians who have had a liberal education in the Humanities, who have a scientific approach to technique, who travel widely, who have the intellectual equipment to rid music of pointless conventions and superstitions. This new generation is by no means unaware of, or disrespectful to the classical tradition. But their awareness is a new awareness. They look forwards, not backwards. They are conscious of the changes taking place all round them. Serious and accurate scholarship is on the increase. The younger critics are trying to sift history from legend, theory from formalism. Texts are being studied and edited. Texts have to be understood in the context in which they were written and the application of the knowledge so gained should not be rigid. The orthodox pandits have a tendency to go by the letter of the text. This is dangerous and misleading. Musical practice, musical intervals, even musical aesthetics are not static things to be perpetuated forever. They change with current practice and are evolved in the course of day-to-day singing and playing. • Seppo Heikinheimo: "The Situation of New Music in Finland," 78-79 (incl. German and French version). vol. 4, 1962 (4)</page><page sequence="328">346 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Abstract : In describing Finnish music life, one cannot overemphasize the significance of a bulky shad- ow - that of Jean Sibelius. To emerge from his influence - to achieve an individual character indepen- dent of Sibelius - has been for many composers one of the hardest stumbling blocks. The Finnish con- cert public is also so entrenched in prejudices that it can scarcely deem it possible that anyone else in Finland might be able to write some good music. This attitude is applied also quite often to new music from abroad. And because the taste of the public - in Finland too - governs the selection of programs; very little new music was heard up to five years ago. Recently, however, one has been able to observe very encouraging progress. In the first place, the Finnish Radio has broadcast and had its orchestra perform a great deal of new music. The other orchestra of the capital city, the Helsinki City Orchestra, has been able to complete quantitatively, if not always qualitatively. Young people in Finland are very interested in the new music and the first studio concert of electronic music, organized at the radio, had to be repeated several times. The Finnish opera is more old-fashioned: up to now they have not gone beyond Bartok and Prokofieff. The only work which approached being modern in this year's season was Werner Egk's "Die Zaubergeige." There are, however, hopeful indications for the future.

Abstract In Europe one often hears the assertion that American music is "behind" the European avant- garde. Upon closer examination, this opinion proves to be erroneous - or at best a half-truth. It is true that the American avant-garde is less well organized, less propagandized and less vocal than its European counterpart. There is less of a premium put on avant-gardism for its own sake in the U. S. Nevertheless some of the original avant-gardists, who now exert a strong influence on European music, are Americans. One is Edgar Varese, who has spent most of his adult life in the United States; another is John Cage, whose influence on the European avant-garde is at the moment unusually strong. As the Donaueschingen Festival of 1961 illustrates, Cage's "aleatory" principles have taken a strong hold on vol. 4, 1962 (3)</page><page sequence="329">2. Contents and Abstracts • 347 such middle-young composers as Boulez and Stockhausen and also on the very young such as Jacques Guyonnet and Peter Schat. Besides Cage, various other American composers, notably Morton Feld- mann and Earl Brown, were pioneers in aleatory techniques, long before this "new" approach to com- position became a la mode in Europe. And today there are many young composers in the United States who are following in their footsteps. The main difference between the avant-gardes of Europe and America is one of backing and, consequently, publicity. Subsidized radio in Europe makes possible the active propagation of "extreme" or "experimental" music and pushes it into the foreground. Whether this is good or bad is not under discussion here. It is mentioned as a fact and a determining factor. • Dragotin Cvetko: "New Music in Yugoslavia," 52-53 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The relations of the public in Yugoslavia to new music are similar to those everywhere else. The radio stations in Zagreb, Belgrade and Ljubljana do a great deal to popularize the new music by including in all programs a new work of most modern type by the most important composers next to standard modern classics. The same can be said for the Yugoslavian orchestras, whose programs always include new works, and chamber music ensembles such as the Pro Arte Quartet (Zagreb), the Quartet of the Ljubljana Radio-TV, individual soloists, groups like Pro Musica Viva (Ljubljana) etc. In the same spirit, the Zagreb Biennale and the Centre for New Music (Opatija), modeled after Donaueschingen or Darmstadt, have been established with the aim of making contemporary music bet- ter known throughout Yugoslavia. The situation, in comparison with the immediate past, has changed significantly. There is far less prejudice. The circle of composers, performers and listeners who enjoy the new music grows broader all the time; there is an increased interest in the creation and performing of new music - and in listening to it. Prospects seem favorable: New music makes its way alongside the standard programs in Yugoslavia. • Pavel Eckstein: "Contemporary Music in Czechoslovakia," 53-55 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : When, just a hundred years ago, Bedřich Smetana published his systematic treatise on con- cert life in Prague, he laid down principles concerning the breadth of the repertory and the support of all contemporary music which still govern today the extremely rich musical activity of Czechoslovakian orchestras, operas and soloists. Prague has always opened its doors to all interesting musical creators of the world. For example, two music festivals of the International Society for Contemporary Music, 1 6 seasons of the Prague Spring Festivals, and international congresses of composers and musicolo- gists. For the promotion of contemporary music there are available today 13 opera houses, 16 large symphony orchestras, four independent chamber orchestras, and countless chamber music ensembles, choruses and soloists. In the regular subscription concerts of the Czech Philharmonic this season, two thirds of the works heard were composed in the 20th century. The Prague Municipal Symphony Or- chestra's programs contained almost fifty per cent of contemporary music. In the case of contemporary works by composers from other countries, preference is usually given to well-tried, established clas- sics, while all new works by native composers are fostered and performed. These works appear in the normal concerts of the orchestras, or in special "First Performance Concerts."

Abstract The International Music Weeks of Paris will take place from October 24th to November 30th, 1962. Initiated in 1958 by the International Music Council, in collaboration with the French National Music Committee and the French Association of Concert Managers. The Festival has this year become a permanent and official institution, founded and supported by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, the City of Paris and the Department of the Seine. The "Semaines Musicales Internationales de Paris" will be given in the French capital every two years and takes its place alongside the festivals of its sister arts: the "Theatre des Nations," the Film Festival of Cannes and the Biennale of the Plastic Arts. The Inter- national Music Council is represented on the Festival's board of governors by its president, secretary general and executive secretary. The executive secretary also participates as artistic adviser. To give a panorama of the principal currents in present-day music, the organizers are arranging to have each program include one classical work, one contemporary work and one new contemporary work - a first performance, when possible.

Donnet: "The Position and Purpose of Jeunesses Musicales in the World," 3-5 (incl. French and German version). Abstract : The Jeunesses Musicales wish to aid youth in the discovery of their musical heritage and to train music lovers through concerts of symphonic music, chamber music or recitals. Let us give as an example the concerts of "Initiation to Music" organized in Brussels by the Jeunesses Musicales with the assistance of the National Radio. In the first year, a series of six concerts presents the basic principles of sound, timbre and rhythm and illustrates the instruments of the orchestra. The last con- cert sums up, with the aid of instrumental films and an orchestral work like Britten's "Guide to the Orchestra," the stages of this evolution of sound. The second year is devoted to the study of musical forms. Each lecture is accompanied by examples played by the orchestra. The third year concentrates on several great composers in the history of music: J. S. Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Debussy and Prokofieff - an entire program is devoted to the works of each composer. If these specially planned concerts with commentary constitute the basic activity of the Jeunesses Musicales in training the listen- ers of tomorrow, the organization also opens up a need for culture and artistic curiosity and encourages the practice of music among young people. • Walter Wiora: "The World of Music as supra-continental Conception," 5-7 (incl. Germans and French version). Abstract : The professional field of musicology is no longer the music of a single outstanding culture, but the music of mankind as a whole. And researchers from all parts of the world are working together accordingly for the wholeness of this field of knowledge; it is not sufficient now simply to summarize the many facts from lexicons and handbooks, but it is a question of establishing the connections as such. This is applicable to the history of music as well as to systematic investigation. In both direc- tions, the broadening of the horizon beyond the thousand years of Occidental art music is required. In the "Acta Musicologica," the periodical of the International Musicological Society, I recently showed how first steps toward a universal-historical conception of music were already taken in the 1 8th century and how this view has since then further developed in spite of nationalism, specialization and other opposing forces. If one takes into account the original state of "rise" as well as the broader period of "continuance," then a general picture of the following four periods or world epochs should result: (I) The pre-historical period, whose achievements survive in "primitive peoples" and in archaic folk music of high cultures. Their elucidation is scientifically possible if one connects up the basic findings of pre- history with the strict methods of comparative study of primitive peoples. (II) The music of the antique high culture of the Sumerian and Egyptian up to late Roman times, as well as the manifold and, for the most part, productive further development in the high cultures of the Orient. The foundation of music theory and other forms of musical "Hochkultur" is already established in Antiquity. (Ill) Occidental art music since the early middle ages. Its particular accomplishment is the development of a musical sys- tem of notation, the corresponding rationalization of rhythm and of polyphony as well as the complete formation of the written, established musical art work. Through its polyphony and harmony as well as through ingenious form devices, as for example the fugue and the symphony, it is differentiated from the other high musical cultures to such an extent that it needs a particular place in the total evolution of music history. (IV) Music in the world epoch of technique and industrial culture - which, after prepara- tory developing features which crop up in the Occidental modern period, particularly the 1 9th century, now in our century has developed completely its characteristic features. Its particular character consists in a series of immense expansions: the spreading of a general music civilization over the whole earth, the spreading of musical works among all social levels of the population, the expansion of possibili- ties of chords, rhythm, etc. up to the limits of the tonal art, technicalization and industrialization. To all these processes of development, there are corresponding opposing movements as, for example, the creation of artificial styles, which are more esoteric than any style of the past has been.</page><page sequence="332">350 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) the world of music 3, 1961 (6) Editors: Egon Kraus, Jack Bornoff, and John Evarts.

Grout: "Report on the New York Meeting of the International Musicological Society," 139^0 (incl. French and German summary). Abstract : Columbia University was the principal host institution, but meetings were held on September 7th at Yale University and on the 9th at Princeton University, while for the two concluding days of the Congress the delegates were entertained at Washington under the auspices of the Music Division of the Library of Congress. In the course of the seven working sessions, twenty-eight groups of specialists discussed subjects ranging from "Origins of Western Polyphony" through "Awareness of Tonality in the Sixteenth Century," "Sources of the Classical Idiom" and "Performance Practice in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries" to "Traditional Forms in the New Musical Idioms." Non-historical sessions dealt with relations between musicology and the visual arts, literature, psychology, acoustics, aesthet- ics, sociology and ethnology. The more specialized topics were treated in Round Tables, where auditors were admitted but discussion was confined to the specialists comprising the panel. • Laurence E. R. Picken: "XIVth Annual Conference of the International Folk Music Council," 140^2 (incl. (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The music of relatively recent immigrants from Eastern Asia was heard in the striking juxta- position of bon-odori songs and dances from Japan and from settlers in Hawaii (Barbara Smith, Uni- versity of Hawaii). Also from the Far East came one of the most moving and impressive musical expe- riences of the Conference - Mantle Hood's demonstration of improvisation on the Javanese gender. In Edith Gerson-Kiwi's company the Conference followed the long migration of Judeo-Hispanic romance to and through the Middle East and listened to distant echoes of Byzantium. It was timely that three of the great cultural complexes of Africa should figure in papers presented to the conference: the highly organized music of Mauretania, impressive in its inarticulate science (T. Nikiprowetzky, Paris); the fascinating hocket-techniques of West African musics with their parallels to medieval procedures (J. H. Nketia, University College of Ghana); and the music of the Bushmen, offered as a possible survival of music from the paleolithic cultures of the cave-painters of Europe (Walter Wiora, Kiel University). The potentialities of two major technical aids to the study of folk song were displayed. First, the "Model B Melograph," developed by Charles Seeger (University of California) and currently revolutionizing standards of analytical acuity; and secondly, the "Sound Spectograph," employed by Alan Lomax in frequency and amplitude analysis of voice-quality. The prospect unfolded of an extension of folk-song analysis in the near future, in depth and intensity far beyond the discriminatory limits of the ear and the graphic capacity of existing systems of notation. • Vladimir Fédorov: "The International Music Council Viewed by One of Its Members," 142^4 (incl. (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract. The Bulletin of the International Music Council should give space to all international mem- ber organizations to make of the Council a truly international organism representative of all the fields of musical life; the coordinating center and the mirror of all tendencies, its national committees and its international member organizations should demonstrate above all a more intense sense of international collaboration.

French and German transi.) Abstract : More than 50 other speakers discussed their special fields in the various meetings on music education under the general topic of "Comparative Studies in Music Education." Not all of the speakers kept to the idea of comparative observations; they reported, rather, on the situation in different sections of their country, what progress was being made and what ends were being sought. There were, how- ever, sufficient contributions which followed the scheme of the program organizers in giving genuinely comparative studies and a panorama of present-day music education in the world; the conclusions were quite clear: stagnation in Latin countries, energetic efforts in the north-west areas, enormous activity in the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. When Leo Kestenberg prepared in 1936 for the first time an international conference of music educators in Prague, his principal motivation was to remove through such a conference some of the existing prejudices. This goal continues to be valid today. • Lionel Salter: "Seminar on 'Music Education Through Technical Media," 1 17-120 (incl. French and German transi.) Abstract : Subsequent discussion by the Seminar ranged over a wide variety of topics: Was radio or TV the better medium for musical education, given that the impact of sight was more immediate than that of sound? Should music education be treated separately, in special school transmission periods, or should parents also be brought into its orbit and home music-making encouraged? There was a danger- ous confusion of values between popular entertainment and serious music and a consequent risk of de- based standards and criteria; quality must be the paramount consideration and in music it was essential to see that its standards of presentation were at least the equal of those of other types of programs fa- miliar to the radio or TV audience. Although (or perhaps because) there was as yet little specific music education on TV, now was the time for music educators to exchange ideas and to ensure that they were fully consulted in preparing 6plans for the future. vol. 3, 1961 (5)</page><page sequence="334">352 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Events of the Season (Manifestations de la Saison/Ereignisse dieser Saison ), 120-22 (127-28; 129-32).

Abstract The question of hybridation, in relation to the preservation of traditional forms, brought out the greatest divergences of opinion among the delegates. Not only Zaven Hacobian (Iran) in his in- troductory paper on the subject but the delegates from all the countries of the Orient showed that the influence of the Occident is far-reaching in different aspects of the musical life of all these countries as well as in Africa, for that matter, according to J. H. Nketia (Ghana). In logical succession, the subject of problems of the preservation of traditional forms was followed by an examination of the means of pres- ervation. Preservation by means of traditional instruction was dealt with by Narayana Menon, Shinichi Yuize and J.H. Nketia. Rather than blindly accepting the role of notation as a means of preservation, the congress expressed the wish of first determining if notation is actually a means of preservation or of destruction of the musics which are traditionally not written down. Kurt Reinhard (German Federal Republic) spoke on the cooperation of the musician - more particularly of the folk musician - in the prospection, transcription, classification, and publishing of music traditionally not notated. Taking ad- vantage of the presence of several representatives of radio organizations, a round table discussion dealt in detail with the role of technical means in the preservation, dissemination, and exchange of traditional learned musics of Oriental countries and the folk music of the Orient and the Occident. • Géza Rech: "The History and Functions of the International Mozarteum Foundation," 90-92 (incl.

Abstract : The most important task of the present time and the near future, however, is the New Mozart Edition ("Neue Mozart- Ausgabe"), which was begun in 1956 by the International Mozarteum Founda- tion. The first 28 volumes have already appeared, published by Bärenreiter- Verlag, and the Foundation is making the greatest effort to continue without interruption and to complete this enormous project, with the aid and support of the national committees which have been already established in many coun- tries within the framework of the "Pro Mozart" campaign. vol. 3, 1961 (4)</page><page sequence="335">2.

Articles • Mario Labroca: "The Responsibility of the Performer towards the Musical Expression of Today and his Relation to the Music of the Past," 59-61 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : It first looks as if everything is foreseen, in advance, so that the performer or performers, under the coercion of a veritable tyranny, will follow the signs on the page - a page which is, inciden- tally, almost always fascinating and beautiful to look at. But, after a closer examination, it appears that in the midst of so many instructions to follow, the performer may move about freely in certain sections where the isolating bar lines have fallen away, leaving to the performer's musicianship, to his sensitiv- ity and to his imagination the responsibility of phrasing and of accentuation. Let us take a look at the past to see how the effort required of the performer has increased since the end of the last century and has already, perhaps, attained its peak. Since the time when certain passages in the scores of Richard Strauss forced the performers to new practices and to the working out of new techniques, we have rapidly moved on to the harmonic logarithms of dodecaphony which have obliged the performers to put aside the rules which had habituated the ear to certain sequences of sounds; we have moved on to Stravinsky's rhythms which have broken up the normal routine of accents. The performer has felt more limited every day, more watched over, and he has ended by being used to such strict guidance that he completely lost the habit of advancing on his own. It is curious to note that at the same time, along with jazz, the love of free and unexpected improvisation has revived in certain performers. • Hardie Racliffe: "Social and Economic Position of the Performing Musician," 61-64 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract Performers, gramophone-record producers and broadcasting organizations have both com- mon and conflicting interests, and, since these have been considered in the many discussions that have occurred leading to the present draft, that draft represents what is thought by many to be an equitable balance between the various claims advanced - a balance attained only after very great effort made in a spirit of compromise. I can give here only a rough indication of the nature of the proposed Con- vention for the Rights of Performers by a few examples of the protection for which it would provide. Performers would have some protection against the recording and broadcasting of their performances without their consent. Gramophone-record producers would be protected against the copying of their vol. 3, 1961 (3)</page><page sequence="336">354 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) records. Broadcasting organizations would be protected against the re-broadcasting and recording of their broadcasts. There are of course many other provisions. To conclude my reference to this inci- dental matter, those of us who represent the interests of performers - and, I think, those organizations representative of gramophone-record producers and broadcasting organizations - hope that the many years of effort devoted to this project by Inter-Governmental and Non-Governmental Bodies will lead before long to adoption of a Convention and to its wide ratification. • Anon.: "Round Table Discussion: The Composer's Point of View," 64-65 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract It is regrettable to observe that the distance between composer and performer seems to be constantly widening; composers complain that their works are not played; performers find the works too difficult or too ungrateful. One feels that composers and performers should come to a closer un- derstanding in their common cause which is music. There is a crisis of communication which is at the basis of the present malaise and it might be fitting to reorganize the system of concerts. One feels that, as doctors and specialists meet to discuss their experiments, similarly, musical specialists should meet to hear certain types of musical experiments, which should be "closed" affairs not open to the public. It was stressed the importance of records as an aid to the understanding of contemporary music. One considers that with the immensity of today's musical repertoire, the organization of concerts in the traditional way is no longer possible. To ensure the continuance of the national musical patrimony, he felt that the governments should increase their support. As far as the dislike of many performers for some types of contemporary music is concerned, one should first be clear about what is meant by "contemporary music." It must be remembered that Honegger and Shostakovitch and many others are just as "contemporary" as some of the younger composers. Music needs the three elements: composer, performer and public. It is dangerous if the composer does not take into account sufficiently the two other elements. Performers are themselves often excellent musicians - sometimes even superior to composers; and the public should not be considered merely as guinea-pigs for experiments. • Wilfried Brennecke: "Venice-Biennale: Nono's 'Intolleranza I960' and Electronic Music," 66-67 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : "Intolleranza 1 960" is more of a symphonic-scenic cantata than an opera in the usual sense. It deals with the fate of an emigrant who returns to his homeland. On every step of his way he shows himself to be the helper of the downtrodden and the needy, for he has arrived at the conclusion that man is the only true help to other men. With clear references to the political conditions in East and West, the text, written partly by Angelo Maria Rippelino and composed partly of quotations from J. Fucik, P. Eluard, E. Majasrowsky, B. Brecht and court testimonies, is passionately topical. Nono has clothed this text with music of lyrical beauty and exciting expressiveness. Its high points are reached in the vocal parts and the symphonic interludes. The "belezza" and "arioso" of Italian vocal art unite very expres- sively with the aggressiveness of the text and the instrumental parts.

Articles • Hans Sittner: "The Training of the Performer," 3 1-33 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract The duty of training professional musicians dates back to the first Italian conservatories of the 1 8th century. The Central-European conservatories of the 1 9th century at first did not aim at pro- ducing professional musicians: they grew out of the love of music of the amateur aristocratic and bour- geois circles especially for choral singing and the cultivation of amateur orchestras in the established music societies of that era. Gradually, they developed into institutions for the education of mostly pro- fessional performers. Today the classes of piano, string and wind instruments, as well as voice training, form the nucleus of every conservatory, whose certificates, although they do not give a person the right to be engaged as a performing musician, are nevertheless being recognized at an ever increasing rate. In general the trade-unions exempt the graduates of a conservatory from special examinations and a steadily increasing number of institutions require a certificate of pedagogic qualification from a con- servatory. However, as far as orchestral and opera house practice is concerned, the audition is still of more importance than the best of certificates but this is the conservatories' precise purpose: to produce a sufficient number of highly qualified young musicians. • Robert Courte: "The Role of a Resident String Quartet in an American University," 34- 35 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract: Scarcely a third of a century ago, chamber music in the U.S. was sent out from New York, like a parcel-post package, to the small cities of the Northwest. Today, we can see that this old central- ized system has disintegrated. The universities and colleges have played the most important role in the radical changes which have taken place - not only in the concert halls but also in the theatres and art exhibitions as well. The University of Michigan, with its extraordinary musical activity is by no means unique of its kind. Other universities of the country have also put out every effort to develop artistic education in their own environments. Twenty years ago a quartet in residence at a university did not exist. But today, the idea of maintaining a professional chamber music group is very popular among the leading institutions of learning. To mention only a few: the Universities of Wisconsin, Michigan, Texas, Alabama, California and Iowa. • Ludwig Finscher: "Memorial Editions in History," 36-38 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : Music philology especially has been greatly refined over the last ten years - with the result that today most of the 19th century editions have already had to be revised and replaced. In addition to the new complete editions of the works of Bach, Gluck and Mozart, (Bärenreiter- Verlag) Haydn and- not yet completed - Beethoven (G. Henle Verlag) an almost incalculable number of collected editions and series have appeared in which, under the sign of the dawning of a period of "world civilization," almost all countries with any musical traditions - from the U.S.A. to Poland and the U.S.S.R., from Sweden to Portugal and Brazil, have taken part.

No longer were all the sections of musical life trying independently to make their voice heard, but had combined to present a coherent body of opinion which cannot but, in the end, stimulate Britain's musical life. Combined action, too, will enable British music to make a greater and greater impact, not only in the western world but in the furthest parts of Asia and of Africa. In this way it can be said that the British National Music Council is playing a vital part in the work of the International Music Council, and perhaps has provided an example to all our other member nations of what can be done and even of the way in which it can be done. • Kurt Hahn: "Sixth General Assembly of the German National Music Committee in Berlin from November 16th to 19th," 5-7 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : In his talk, which embraced all fields of our intellectual and spiritual life, "German Music in the Tension of Our Time," Hans Mersmann warned against the widespread overestimation today of single directions in music and opposed to this the richness and many-faceted character of artistic expression as a positive virtue of our time. The three talks of the plenary sessions were, first of all, con- cerned with the international concerns of the German Committee. Wolfgang Fortner spoke on "Prob- lems of German Music Abroad, Out of Sight of the Composer," Egon Kraus on "Music and Musicians in International Exchange." Contemporary music had a central place in each of these talks. Walter Wiora discussed "The International Position and Task of German Musicology." He pointed out the close liaison which exists with the international professional world and indicated that it was the aim of musicologists in all countries to work in close cooperation on the common tasks of musicology. • Henry Barraud: "IMC Congress on 'The Performer'," 7-9 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The eternal problem for composers is following the difficult road to bring their wares before the public - they have the need of intermediaries between their creative work and the people whom they are addressing. The problem may be said to have three aspects: economic, physiological and psychological. Events of the Season (Manifestations de la Saison/Ereignisse dieser Saison ), 9-10(17; 22).

Abstract : With the French National Music Committee acting as intermediary, the Government, and the City of Paris and the Department of the Seine together gave sufficient funds to repeat the "Semaines Musicales de Paris" in 1960. And they are not "Just another Festival." In four weeks there were nine- teen concerts. And there was the broadest variety which extended from an oratorio to Vietnamese improvisation, from a classic chorale to dodecaphony, from the fanfare of the Garde Républicaine to Japanese music. • Everett Helm: "The Performer," 123-27 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : A fundamental antithesis became clear between the Western performer and his Eastern coun- terpart. In his paper "The Emotional Approach of the Oriental Performer" Trän Van Khê (Viet-Nam) underlined the vast differences in the Eastern and Western performer's attitude towards musical per- formance. It was of special interest to hear of the fundamental role played by improvisation in Oriental and Arabian music, at a time when the improvisatory element appears to be reentering the framework of Western music, after having all but disappeared for over a century. Several speakers were of the opinion that improvisation in one form or another is again in the ascendency and that performers will devote more attention to this factor in the future. In this connection it was highly instructive to hear Jacques Chailley's masterly summary of the role of improvisation in the music of past epochs which, it seems, was far greater than has hitherto been realized. A question which, had it been pursued, might well have provoked a heated debate was mentioned only in passing by Gilbert Amy (France) in con- nection with modern avant-garde practice - namely, the so-called "aleatorie" principles that leave the performer a certain freedom of choice in shaping the material of a given passage or within the inexact- ly-defined limits of a given form. • Trän Van Khê: The Emotional Approach of the Performer of Oriental Music," 127-30 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : The Chinese musician, in antiquity, could not play music, especially on the qin , a 5 to 7-stringed zither, unless he was in a tranquil spiritual state: the music which he played was supposed to create "unity and peacefulness between father and son, between prince and subject." The emotional approach of the performer of Chinese music - in ancient times, at least, - was such that his music "filled the heart with generous sentiments and at the same time moderated the passions." In Arabian music, on the other hand, the most famous performers were those who could arouse very strong emo- tions in the listeners.

Abstract : Some 1600 young participants from the 18 member countries of the International Federation of Musical Youth had come to Berlin - to the city between the frontiers, in whose fate an historical re- sponsibility is reflected. The tasks of the Congress was sketched as a platform for delegates and youth groups to discuss their problems openly, as a chance to examine the evidence of the practical work of the individual countries through the supplementary artistic programs and as an occasion for bringing together youth through music. In addition to the daily meetings of the delegates, the participants were occupied with three youth forums concerned with topical questions: jazz, opera and electronic music. • Henryk Szeryng: "Responsibility of the Performer towards Contemporary Music," 1 00- 101 (incl.

Abstract : In order to keep apace of our times, and particularly in relation to the fields of painting and literature, we should give greater aid to the field of musical creation, which is rather behind the prog- ress made in the mentioned arts. With the interest, healthy curiosity and patience which are indispens- able to interpreters in order to familiarize themselves with the music of today, the performers will be able not only to aid and stimulate the composers in their work and development but they will also and especially be able to pride themselves on having contributed to making it possible for our best critic - the Public - to make the definitive choice of what can and should survive from the contemporary out-put. • Laurence Picken: "13th Annual Conference of the International Folk Music Council Held in Vienna, July 24th to 29th, 1969," 101-03 (incl.

Abstract : The American Opera Workshop is one of the most interesting manifestations of the growing demand for opera in the United States. Cut off from the supply of European artists during the Second World War, America became aware of her own talent and potentialities in operatic production. Today music schools, colleges, and universities from coast to coast teach and foster opera in many ways. They are the genuine centers of culture in America and play a very similar role in the study, research, and promotion of the arts and humanities as the cloisters did in European mediaeval days. The drama departments of American colleges and universities have long been known for their important contri- butions to the American theater. The more recent development of the opera workshop or department reflects America's belated and enthusiastic recognition of opera, problematic, complicated, and contro- versial as this art form is by the very nature of its structure, comprising the arts of music, drama, dance, architecture, sculpture, and painting. • Hermann Voss: "The Problem of Young Talent for German Orchestras," 73-75 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : At the instigation of the German Orchestral Association (Deutsche Orchester- Vereinigung e. V.) an "Artistic Council for the Maintenance and Support of German Orchestral Tradition" was formed. The most urgent reason for the formation of this Council was the deep concern for the future young per- formers in the German orchestras. Since people either consciously or unconsciously make comparisons with radio and record performances, which are usually given by the very best symphony orchestras and with the aid of a highly-developed recording technique, the demands of the public for a higher standard in the concert halls and opera have also become greater. If the attraction of these sanctuaries of the liv- ing art is not to be diminished, the effects of this new competition must be recognized and the necessary conclusions must be drawn from them. vol. 2, 1960 (4)</page><page sequence="342">360 • the world of music 53, 2011 (1-3) Events of the Season (Manifestations de la Saison/Ereignisse dieser Saison), 75-77 (79- 80; 86-88).

Abstract Our century has given birth to a phenomenon which has now grown to be a durable part of our artistic and even social pattern of life: the International Festival. Its extinction by suffocation has often been predicted. But nevertheless there seems to be no stopping its expansion. Every year new festivals with various labels spring up here and there, while the already existing festivals continue to develop and grow. The formula of an international festival is not, however, an invention of our century. The idea of concentrating within a determined period a certain number of exceptional performances was to be found already in England in the annual festivals organized first in 1 709 at St. Paul's Cathedral in London and which, after 1724 brought together the choirs of Gloucester, Worcester and Hereford Cathedrals; since that time they have come together in each of these three cities on an alternating basis, each year. In their turn, Norwich and Leeds established in the 18th century a similar annual festival. One should remember, too, in Germany the famous Rhine Festival, which was held alternatively in the cities of Düsseldorf, Cologne, and Aachen; and, again in Germany, those festivals organized in honor of Beethoven in Bonn in 1845, and in honor of Bach at the beginning of this century in Berlin, Eisen- ach and Leipzig; and finally, of course, the Festival of Bayreuth, devoted to Wagner and inaugurated in 1 876. With its practically uninterrupted tradition of 86 years up to today, Bayreuth stands out as the prototype of the European Festival. • Friedrich Suck: "Memorial Editions," 52-55 (incl.

The German Music-Historical Archives in Kassel, with its rich film collection whose catalogue has just appeared, is the principal center of source materi- als in German music up to 1700. The beginnings of memorial editions go back to the second half of the 18th century. This was surely no accident, for at just that time there was growing a new historical consciousness - which regarded its own "present" in lively relation to the past and which subordinated vol. 2, 1960 (3)</page><page sequence="343">2.

French and German transi.). Abstract : In these months the attention of the whole musical world is drawn to the 150th anniversary of Fryderyk Chopin's birth. Because of his upbringing, because of his own professions and the very national flavor of his music, Chopin can rightly be celebrated as the greatest genius of Polish music and as an embodiment of the Polish spirit. Polish musicians and musicologists, who have brought to a successful conclusion their labors of several years to publish a complete Chopin Edition, are preparing in celebration of the anniversary year a series of recordings which will include all of Chopin's works. In addition to the Chopin Piano Competition, which takes place every five years and which was won on this occasion by the 18-year-old Italian, Maurizio Pollini (Milan), the Polish authorities invited mu- sicologists this year to the First International Musicological Chopin Congress. Some 150 participants from many corners of the world attended the Congress to listen to the papers and panel discussions and to participate in the general, lively discussions concerning the various problems related to Chopin and Polish music history. On this occasion, Chopin's birth-city, Warsaw, provided a unique Forum of en- counters between the East and the West. Speakers came from 2 1 countries - eight from East and eight from West European countries, from the U. S.A., Australia, Israel, China, and Japan. • François Lesure: "A Step towards a General Inventory of Ancient Music: the RISM," 29-30 (incl. French and German transi.).

Articles • Alain Daniélou: "The Importance of the Preservation of the Traditional Musical Culture in Oriental Countries," 2 -4 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : It is not impossible to imagine that the Asian civilizations may completely give up their own cultures and, becoming entirely assimilated into Occidental cultures, end up by making an important and original contribution to Western arts, but that would take an extremely long time and it is difficult to see the advantage in it. It was under the reign of Peter the Great that the Russians began to adapt their traditional music to the musical traditions of the West and at the end of a century they began to have some very important composers "in the European style." The Japanese have been working in this style, too, for almost a century and although their composers and their Occidental orchestras are remarkable, up to now they represent for many of us only an appendage of our musical art which rarely seems to provide us with a really original contribution. It is to the nõ, the gagaku , which the whole civilized world bows with respect. They represent, in all their traditional severity, the peaks of an art which make Japan one of the great civilizations of the world. Although the Japanese youth take relatively little inter- est in them, it is the traditional arts which make Japan the equal or perhaps the superior of the greatest past or present cultures of the world. Whereas, its excellent accomplishments in the Occidental styles in modern art may make of it a cultural dependent of the Occident. The situation is more acute in India and the Middle East. Only an immediate and continual effort, governed by the greatest intelligence, will make it possible to preserve the magnificent classical music of India, Pakistan and Iran. • Z.A. Bokhari: "The Composer in Pakistan Faces New Problems," 4-5 (incl. French and German transi.). vol. 2, 1960(1)</page><page sequence="345">2. Contents and Abstracts • 363 Abstract : Generally speaking, the music of the East, and certainly that of Pakistan, is based on a single line, on horizontal melody, and the instruments accompanying a singer play in unison. This system satisfied our needs amply when our music was confined to salons or small rooms. But with the advent of radio and film, listening to music is no longer the prerogative of the few. Music has now moved "to the people," and, as in the case of movie-goers and music hall lovers, the people go to concerts in large numbers. And this situation, this form of listening in large groups - is directly opposed to the practice of listening to music in this part of the world a quarter of a century ago. The young composer, therefore, is making an effort in Pakistan to adapt his music to the new needs - to give the music greater fullness through the addition of vertical harmony, to give it greater bulk and substance and carrying power in the larger concert halls. But he is balked at every move. To start with, music is still to a very large ex- tent, in the hands of those who are not very well educated. Secondly, the instruments which exist in this part of the world are not adapted to playing in any particular key. And thirdly, there is no recognized system of notation. The result of this is appalling. Our modern music, generally speaking, is a bad copy of bad Western music, the hodge-podge quality of which is accentuated by any or all of the instruments which the composer can put his hands on. The composer, let me hasten to add, is painfully aware of the shortcomings, but lacks the necessary tools and knowledge to rectify them. Pakistan and several other countries neighboring Pakistan are struggling, on the one hand, to preserve their cultural heritage in music, and, on the other hand, to make progress in the use of harmony. • Karl Vötterle: "The Epoch of the Complete Edition," 5-8 (incl. French and German transi.). Abstract : It is quite normal for the collections of the complete works of great poets to form the basis of a family's library. Editions of the collected works of great composers are rare and are often not even to be found in libraries or music institutions, although the language of music - in its live state, created by performers - is understood by all people and, like no other language, is especially endowed as a medium for uniting peoples and contributing to international understanding. There is not even a single complete edition of such indisputable classics as Joseph Haydn and Christoph Willibald Gluck, and as for those complete editions of other masters which have been made (mostly in the 1 9th century), most of them, since only a few hundred copies were published, have long since been out of stock and exist today only in incomplete form. The answer to the question of why the collected works of composers, in comparison with those of poets, have appeared only in such limited numbers is not difficult to find. In the first place, the cost of production - engraving and printing of the music itself - and as a conse- quence, the price of a musical work is incomparably higher than that of a literary work. Furthermore, in comparison with a book, the collected works of a composer are of interest to a relatively limited audience.

Abstract : Hermann Scherchen is probably the most forward-thinking, pioneer-minded musician of our time. He is also the most unchanging, unchangeable feature in the fast-changing music world of this century. Consideration of some of Scherchen 's achievements in the course of his 50 years and more activity will explain this apparent paradox. Beginning with Schoenberg in 1910 - Scherchen took part in the first performance of "Pierrot Lunaire" and conducted the first performance of the first Kammersymphonie - there has hardly since been a composer of note with whom he has not been con- nected, and whom he has not actively helped at an early, and decisive, stage. For a very recent example, we need do no more than quote Luigi Dallapiccola after listening to a tape recording by Scherchen of Anton Webern's Second Cantata, op. 31. "Scherchen has succeeded in creating the 'world of sound' of the 2nd Cantata with matchless humanity and inner movement." In the course of a profound analysis of this particular interpretation, Dallapiccola seems to put his finger on the most characteristic quality vol. 1, 1959 (3) vol. 1, 1959 (4)</page><page sequence="347">2.

Abstract : Whatever the merits of electronic music may be at present or as a fruitful medium for future composers, there is no doubt about the fact that today many serious composers and researchers are devoting their time and energies to it in a great many countries, and there is, on the part of the public, if not wild enthusiasm for the results, at least a great curiosity, as was shown in the recent "festival" performances in Paris. And the least that can be said at this point is that, along with the expansion of our knowledge of outer space the horizons of music are also becoming considerably broader by the musique concrète, electronic music, by exotic music, and music in the tape medium.

Abstract : There should be some lively argument on the subject of live versus pre-recorded, or pre- filmed, or "ghosted" performance by actors. Producers hold strong views. At least one country has pre-recorded the orchestral accompaniment to a complete opera, and then filmed the live actors singing to it. Others pre-record the whole work; afterwards the original cast, or perhaps a completely fresh cast of non-singing actors, mime to the music for the camera. Examples will be shown of opera re-enacted in natural open-air settings, of scenes in which, because of the exigencies of casting, singing and mim- ing actors are actually mixed on the set; of scenes filmed direct from the operatic stage, or re-arranged slightly for a camera in the theatre auditorium. Comparisons can be drawn between standard operas photographed in a theatre, or presented from a studio, and musical works created especially for the television screen. Whenever possible the producers personally concerned will discuss their reasons, techniques and achievements: to dup or not to dub is the question. • Hanson, Raymond: "Music in Australia," 24-26 (incl.
