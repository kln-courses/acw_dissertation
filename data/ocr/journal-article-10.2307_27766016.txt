Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism: A Wittgensteinian Ecofeminist Alternative to Deep Ecology ABSTRACT: While articulating a philosophy of ecology which ree onciles deep ecology with ecofeminism may be a laudable project, it remains at best unclear whether this attempt will be successful. I argue that one recent attempt, Carol Bigwood's feminized deep ecology, fails in that, despite disclaimers, it reproduces important elements of some deep ecologisti essentializing discourse which ecofeminists argue are responsible for the identification with and dual oppression of women and nature. I then propose an alternative model for conceiving and describing human and nonhuman nature modeled on Wittgenstein's remarks con cerning anthropomorphizing which I argue is immune to this criticism. ECOFEMINISM AND DEEP ECOLOGY: SEEING THE FOREST/SEEING THE TREES In a recent Hypatia article,1 Robert Sessions profiles the contested terrain which animates much of the current discourse between ecofemi nists and deep ecologists. Taking Karen Warren's claim that "[t]here are important connections between the oppression of women and the oppression of nature" as representative,2 Sessions explains that ecofeminists regard oppression as funda mentally dual in that the "conceptual framework" which undergirds the domina tion of nonhuman nature also undergirds the domination of women.3 Warren Direct all correspondence to: Wendy Lee-Lampshire, Department of Philosophy, Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg, PA 17815. Wendy Lee Lampshire 91</page><page sequence="2">92 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 1, No. 2,1996 argues, for example, that analyses of environmental abuse must be performed in tandem with analyses of patriarchy in that our anthropocentric conceptions of non human nature parallel traditionally androcentric conceptions of women; both rep resent the nonrational or irrational radical other of "man." For the anthropocentrist, the value of nonhuman nature lies in its usefulness to humans; for the androcen trist, the value of a woman lies in her usefulness to men.4 If Warren is correct, any ecological ethic which fails to recognize that anthropocentrism and androcentrism operate as an intimately related dynamic risks reproducing not only the opression of women, but of nature as well. For, given this dynamic, there is no way to neatly separate the opression of one from that of the other.5 While few deep ecologists would deny that women have been oppressed, some, such as Warwick Fox argue that the ecofeminist focus on androcentrism is misguided in that we can envision an anthropocentric but nonandrocentric society. That is, we can envision a society in which neither women nor other human beings are oppressed but, by collective consensus, nonhuman nature is.6 Liberal femi nists, for example, oppose androcentrism on the fundamentally anthropocentric grounds that women are as capable of transcending instinct as men in that women, like men but unlike nonhumans, are rational creatures.7 From a deep ecological perspective, then, a liberal feminist utopia could look much like what it hopes to replace, a world squarely divided into a series of familiar oppositions: rational nonrational, user-used, mind-body, human-nature. According to Fox, this possibil ity, added to the fact that we could not logically envision an androcentric but nonanthropocentric society (since males are humans), demonstrates that the real problem is human-centeredness, not male-centeredness.8 For deep ecologists the root of oppression is the anthropocentric belief that only human beings are valuable in and of themselves. The anthropocentric world is thus divided into two kinds of value or worth, that which is inherent and that which is assigned. Anthropocentrists justify such a division of value on the ground that inherent worth confers moral authority and thus establishes a natural relationship of assigner and assigned, user and resource, superior and inferior. On this view, something whose worth is assigned is valuable only insofar as she/he/it serves as a means to some human end. Moreover, given the threat to human life and well being posed by resources like rivers and fires, inherent worth also confers the moral authority to control such resources in order to insure their service to human ends. The anthropocentrist claims that were it not for humans nonhuman nature would have no value because assigned worth is merely the product of those whose inherent worth defines them as ends. The oppression of women, the expropriation of indigenous peoples, and slavery are for the anthropocentrist "simply" unfortu nate historical examples of how the principle of inherent worth has been misapplied by some humans to others who, conceived as nonhuman or not fully human, are portrayed as both threats and resources like Mother Nature herself. Sessions points out that for deep ecologists the culprit in oppression is not the principle of inherent worth itself, but its speciesist application. Arne Naess, for</page><page sequence="3">Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism 93 example, argues that reuniting humans with nonhumans and oppressed humans begins with the recognition that all inhabitants of Earth are equal with respect to inherent worth.10 Sessions explains that, for Naess, to recognize this equality is to effectively transcend one's anthropocentric self. Extending the principle of inher ent worth to nonhumans allows one to become an "ecosophical" self, that is, a self realized through lived acknowledgement of the unity of all nature amidst the diver sity of species.11 Rather than jettisoning inherent worth, Naess seeks to expand its range arguing further that recognizing the equality of all species will ultimately encourage actions which promote ecological egahtarianism, anti-anthropocen trism and anti-speciesism.12 Despite their apparent differences, Sessions argues that it is possible to develop a dialogue between deep ecologists and ecofeminists. He argues that although ecofeminism's emphasis on androcentrism significantly modifies deep ecology's analysis of oppression, the two positions are not really incompati ble.13 First, ecofeminists do not so much dispute the claim that anthropocentrism lies at the origin of oppression, rather they provide historical depth by showing how human-centeredness has been reinforced through the oppression of women.14 Second, albeit in different vocabularies, both deep ecol ogists and ecofeminists promote images of unity in diversity. Although critical of the emphasis on transcendence, for example, the ecofeminist notion of com munity as a whole composed of many and diverse but equally valuable parts bears a significant family resemblence to Naess's notion of an ecosophical self insofar as both are attempts to articulate a fundamental equality among crea tures without diminishing the differences that make each unique.15 We might say that deep ecologists emphasize the forest and ecofeminists the relations among the trees, but this is merely a difference of focus, not principle. Sessions concludes that dialogue between ecofeminists and deep ecologists is possible, particularly if attention is paid to sharpening notions like "community," "equal ity," and "self."16 I suggest, however, that any such dialogue is destined to remain shallow. For although Sessions provides an accurate surface topography of ecofeminist-deep ecologist conflicts and commonalities, he fails to see the underlying framework of being (ontology) and knowing (episteme) which accounts for the anthropocen trism/androcentrism dynamic's tenacity. I will show that not only can this dynamic not be undermined through the extension of the notion of inherent worth to nonhu mans, but that the same philosophical difficulties which accompany the dynamic accompany the deep ecological solution to oppression as well. CAROL BIGWOOD'S FEMINIZED DEEP ECOLOGY: SHADOWS OF RADICAL OTHERNESS In her recently published book, Earth Muse, Carol Bigwood develops what I will call a feminine or feminized deep ecology.17 Relying primarily</page><page sequence="4">94 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 1, No. 2,1996 on the work of Martin Heidegger, Bigwood argues that "feminist philosophy involves an ecological consciousness" and that restoring the environment requires restoring historically neglected feminine ways of knowing and being.18 Like War ren, Bigwood argues that the roots of anthropocentrism and those of androcentrism are intimately intertwined.19 However, whereas Warren locates these roots in socio culturally constructed concepts of women and nature, Bigwood locates them in the neglect of human embodiment as it is revealed in women's unique "feminine" expe rience of nature through processes like menstruation and birth.20 Although wary of reproducing traditional human-nature, mind-body, man woman dualisms,21 Bigwood nonetheless warns against what she perceives as the current tendency in feminism to eradicate "any attempt to identify basic human practices or general human needs."22 Her project is to reintroduce human connect edness to nature without either invoking the essentialism that has tended to accompany radical feminism,23 or reinforcing the poststructura?st tendency to view gender as completely socially constructed: When one looks at the long list of feminists accused of different kinds of essentialism, one fears that the recent move to purge the last vestiges of essentialism from feminism [by feminists] might be in danger of turning into a kind of gender theory inquisition whereby certain kinds of feminist theories are silenced as heretical. In order to prevent many productive strands of feminism from disappearing and future ones from appear ing, it is important to find a way of reconciling the renewed attempt to purge feminism of essentialism with the established feminist project to reclaim female perspec tives... in order to do this we must be able to reaffirm female specificity without fall ing into biologism, ahistoric?l categories, and inflexible cross-cultural categories.24 Bigwood's point is that by rejecting any notion of "female specificity" or "female embodiment,"25 feminism endangers one of its most fundamental projects, namely, the reclamation of women's experience and view of the world. Bigwood argues that women are not only embodied beings inhabiting the world, but reproductive, mothering beings whose role in labor and birth differentiates women's experience significantly from that of men.26 Her emphasis on sexual dif ference reaffirms the traditional view that women are connected to nature in a way that men are not. Yet Bigwood insists that sexual difference can be conceptualized in nonessentialist ways.27 Key to understanding what Bigwood means by "reaffirming female specific ity" is her use of the Heideggerian concept of presence: Presencing, for Heidegger, is not the property of presence in present objects but is a verb that denotes genesis as difference. It is a movement that simultaneously emerges, granting the unconcealing of beings, and holds itself back, concealing itself. Presencing vibrates, shimmers, because it is a presencing that is always simultaneously absencing. This absencing is not the emptiness of nih?istic deferment, however, but a fullness like that of the dark holding of the inner recesses of a jug... [I]n the face of essentialism, we can affirm the concept of the feminine as a notion that has a lasting presence of some sort but that is not an atemporal unchanging essence.28 For Bigwood, "the feminine" describes a way of being or presencing in the "world-earth-home" which is both basic to the existence of female human beings</page><page sequence="5">Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism 95 and yet is not reducible to any given set of ahistorical transcendent properties.29 The feminine is thus neither naturally nor socially constituted but rather consists in the historically specific presence of embodied female beings. Like water, feminine presence is "a fluid constancy that remains open to further determination but has an historical, existential continuity."30 That is, like water, the feminine is essentially what it is, namely, a way of presencing uniquely constituted by a bodily relation ship to the world, experience of which does not flow in any detenriinate direction. The feminine is a form of genesis in difference, where difference is understood not in terms of a being's properties, but in terms of its lived embodiment in the world earth-home. Bigwood conceives the role of the feminine within ecological ethics much like deep ecologists conceive the role of inherent worth. For by recognizing women's connectedness to nature we are enabled to recognize our human being as a form of embodied presence within the world conceived as a holistic "web of living relation ships."31 Like inherent worth, feminine presence cannot be assigned but is rather part and parcel of existing as a specific kind of thing. Granted, the feminine describes female specificity, but it also reflects embodiment more generally, and thus reminds us of one of deep ecology's most fundamental operating premises: worth inheres in being as such; to exist is to exist as equally valuable. Inherent worth, then, need not be conceived as a property; rather, worth inheres as ways of being. As a way of being the feminine expresses a manner in which worth inheres in a thing. To recognize this specific form of worth is simultaneously to recognize the fundamental equality of being, the foundation of "ecological consciousness." To the extent that Bigwood introduces the specificity of women's experience into deep ecology, she appears to offer a viable way to address conceptual conflicts between deep ecologists and ecofeminists. In Bigwood's feminine deep ecology the anthropocentrism/androcentrism dynamic seems to be successfully under mined through the extension of feminine presence to our understanding of embodiment in general. Just as deep ecologists show how the recognition of inher ent worth in nonhumans grounds claims against anthropocentrism, Bigwood shows how recognizing the feminine in human connectedness to the natural world grounds claims against androcentrism. I suggest, however, that inherent worth and feminine presence are not similar merely with respect to the roles they play within their respective ethical theories; in addition, both elicit an ontology and an episteme in which the ability to recognize that which inheres encourages the assumption that things have recognizable essences. This ability is epistemologically crucial to ethical-political action insofar as it grounds ecological consciousness, yet it raises serious difficulties for deep ecologists including Bigwood. Undennining the anthropocentrism/androcentrism dynamic requires undermining its ontological framework, namely, the assumption that humans and nonhumans, men and women, are essentially different kinds of beings. However, the ability to recognize inherent worth or feminine presence elic its just such a framework insofar as notions like "inherence" or "presence" imply</page><page sequence="6">96 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 1, No. 2,1996 that which is essential to a way of being. Rather than undermining the anthropo centrism/androcentrism dynamic, then, deep ecologists unwittingly reinforce and perpetuate it. Bigwood would likely respond by stressing that she explicitly eschews any notion of essence conceived as a "transhistorical" property of a thing,32 opting instead for the more diffuse and historically indeterminate notion of presence. However, once she commits herself to an episteme in which ecological conscious ness is dependent upon recognizing that which inheres, it does not matter whether we conceive the feminine as a property or as a indeterminate way of being for we could not recognize the feminine presence of a being unless it defined that being essentially. Neither, then, could we value it, and this leaves us with a dilemma: If ecological consciousness (or Naess's ecosophical self) encourages us to tacitly subscribe to an essentialist ontology, it also encourages us to view humans and nonhumans, men and women, as not merely different but essentially different which, if Warren's analysis is correct, supports the perpetuation of the anthropo centrism/androcentrism dynamic. Session's hope for a dialogue between ecofeminists and deep ecologists can not be fulfilled in Bigwood. For although traditional distinctions between self and other, mind and body, male and female, human and nonhuman are blurred at the superficial level of Bigwood's appeal to ecological consciousness, the epistemol ogy required to support this appeal elicits an ontology firmly grounded in an essential otherness contrary to Bigwood's best intentions. Note that I have not insisted that Bigwood's feminine deep ecology does rely on an essentialist ontol ogy, but only that it encourages its subscribers to view others in this way. This is enough, for all that is required to reinforce the longstanding multi-institutional anthropocentrism/androcentrism dynamic is the intimation of radical otherness provided tacitly by notions like inherence or presence. Is there any way to articulate an ecological ethic capable of supporting real demands for charge in attitude and action without encouraging tacitly or otherwise the essentialism elicited by even the most enlightened of deep ecologies like Carol Bigwood's? I believe this answer may be found in the remarks of later Wittgen stein, to whom we will now turn. A WITTGENSTEINIAN ALTERNATIVE: ANTHROPOMORPHISM WITHOUT ANTHROPOCENTRISM In a passage from Philosophical Investigations II Wittgen stein remarks: The evolution of the higher animals and of man, and awakening of consciousness at a particular level. The picture is something like this: Though the ether is filled with vibra tions the world is dark. But one man opens his seeing eye, and there is light.</page><page sequence="7">Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism 97 What this language primarily describes is a picture. What is to be done with this picture, how it is to be used, is still obscure. Quite clearly, however, it must be explored if we want to understand the sense of what we are saying. But the picture seems to spare us this work; it already points to a particular use. This is how it takes us in.33 We might call such a picture The Dawn of Anthropocentrism in that it por trays the way in which humans conceive differences between humans and nonhumans in terms of light and darkness, seeing and blindness; it portrays dif ferences in terms of oppositions between clearly superior and clearly inferior things. Wittgenstein's aim here is to prod us to examine the powerful influence that pictures like this have on the way we conceive things. He points out that the picture "takes us in" by offering a determinate, unobscure way to conceive what things are in terms of their place in the picture. To be "taken in," however, is also to be duped or deceived, perhaps by the sheer convenience of concepts whose use seems crisply unambiguous. To this extent, then, the picture invites us to explore not only our concepts, but the contexts required to support such an unambiguous use. Wittgenstein prods us to ask whether, given the multiple ways and contexts in which we use concepts, such a picture is accurate, and he facilitates just such as investigation through his use of example and portrayal. For example: The chair is thinking to itself: Where? In one of its parts? Or outside its body; in the air around it? Or not anywhere at all? But then what is the difference between this chair's saying something to itself and another one's doing so, next to it??But then how is it with man: where does he say things to himself? How does it come about that this question seems senseless; and that no specification of a place is necessary except just that this man is saying something to himself? Whereas the question where the chair talks to itself seems to demand an answer?the reason is: we want to know how the chair is supposed to be like a human being; whether, for instance, the head is at the top of the back and so on.34 Ironically, the anthropocentrism of our original picture seems to be seriously obscured by the anthropomorphizing which characterizes this second passage. We may be as put off by this second picture as we are "taken in" by the first. For when we attempt to describe where and how "the chair is thinking to itself we realize that this context could only be determined if it were clear where and how humans think to themselves; but this picture is not clear. We want to know how chairs are like us, but what we discover is that the notion "like us" is itself not as clear as our original picture implies, for it is not clear how psychological notions like "thinking" apply to our own case. In Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology; Vol. U Wittgenstein asks us to: suppose that our picture of thinking was a human being, leaning his head on his hand while he talks to riimself. Our question is not "Is that a correct picture?" but "How is this picture employed as a picture of thinking?" Say, not: "We have formed a wrong picture of thinking"?but: "We don't know our way about in the use of our word."35</page><page sequence="8">98 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 1, No. 2,1996 Our picture of thinking is as clear as that of someone leaning their head on their hand while talking to themselves, which to say, as clear as an indefinite num ber of pictures. The picture is not wrong, but rather blurs at its edges.36 Were it clear, we would be able to show how chairs are like us by showing how chairs are as unlike us as the nonthinking is radically unlike the thinking. Applying anthropo morphic characteristics to the chair ought to amount to nothing more than applying to nonhumans characteristics that humans really have. But when we ask what humans really have, what we conjure up are pictures of people with their face in their hands, or perhaps pictures of hair-pulling, chin scratching, or brow furrowing. The thinking-nonthinking opposition breaks down, for it seems to make as much or as little sense to ask where and how humans have thoughts as it does to ask where and how chairs do. "Humans really have thoughts in their heads" we might say, but this is uninformative since the picture we conjure up here, say, of a homun culus with her head in her hands, simply transfers our original picture inside our heads. The context in which we employ psychological concepts like "thinking" does not support the drawing of unambiguous distinctions between what humans really have and nonhumans have only anthropomo hically for this context is as complex and indeterminate as the things which inhabit it. To treat a chair as if it could think may prove to be uninformative in most instances, but clearly not in all. We can easily imagine children's games in which treating the chair as if it could think would serve a useful purpose. Moreover, if anthropomorphizing the chair is uninformative it is not because the chair is not alive. After all, we not only do anthro pomorphize inanimates from teapots37 to ragdolls38 to computers39 to macro-mole cules,40 but we often could not describe a thing's behavior and actions without so doing.41 What Wittgenstein's examples and portrayals show is that anthropomorphiz ing is not only not necessarily anthropocentric, but may produce precisely the opposite effect, namely, the blurring of Unes taken to distinguish humans from nonhumans. Consider a last example: One can imagine an animal angry, frightened, unhappy, happy, startled. But hopeful? And why not? A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his master will come the day after to-morrow??And what can he not do here??How do I do it??How am I supposed to answer this? Can only those hope who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of a lan guage. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this complicated form of life. (If a concept refers to a character of human handwriting, it has no application to beings who do not write.)42 By prodding the reader to ask not only what the dog can't do, but what the human can do, Wittgenstein deliberately blurs human-nonhuman, rational-nonra tional oppositions. For in order to provide an unambiguously and exclusively human picture of hoping we must be able clearly to distinguish the concept of hop</page><page sequence="9">Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism 99 ing from other similar concepts (i.e., waiting, expecting, or wanting) that we do apply to nonhumans like dogs. But the contexts in which we employ such concepts and the things to which we apply them turn out to be too complicated and indeter minate for a crisp distinction to be possible.43 The complexity and indeterminacy of being human which we insist warrants the human-nonhuman distinction actually undermines it. For it is precisely this complexity that is reflected in our language, rendering our concepts indeterminate as well. The Dawn of Anthropocentrism may seem to do our conceptualizing work for us, but on closer inspection we see that it cannot, for the picture requires that we be able to draw the sorts of distinctions that, when we go to describe phenomena like thinking or hoping, we find we cannot draw because the psychological con cepts that we employ in such descriptions have no unambiguous application to our own bio-psycho-contextually complex cases. Given this, we can only conclude that to describe ourselves as thinking or hoping is to anthropomorphize. WITTGENSTEINIAN ECOFEMINISM: ANTHROPOMORPHIZING AS HEURISTIC AND ETHIC Although deep ecologist Arne Naess would expand inher ent worth to nonhumans, and feminist deep ecologist Carol Bigwood would effec tively deepen it to include feminine presence, this notion is profoundly troubled. As we saw in our exploration of Bigwood, any ethic which encourages us to value things in terms of recognizing their essential natures?however we conceive them?contributes to the reinforcement of the anthropocentrism/androcentrism dynamic by encouraging us to conceive differences as essential differences. Witt genstein's examples show, moreover, that since there is no clear way to distinguish between concepts which name what humans really have and what nonhumans have only anthropomorphically, there is no way to determine in what essential dif ferences could consist. Like thinking and hoping, inherent worth and feminine presence are notions whose application is bound to be so blurred by the contexts and complexities of particular cases that the claim that something really has inher ent worth or really manifests feminine presence turns out not to be of much use to the attempt to describe what something does. However, the distinction that Wittgenstein's remarks allow us to draw between anthropocentrism and anthropormo hism offers us a radically novel way to conceive the value of nonliving as well as living things. Rather than recognizing inherent value, Wittgenstein's examples prod us to recognize that we anthropo morphize not only in those instances where we explicitly acknowledge it, but every time we go to describe the behavior and actions of a thing. Indeed, on this alterna tive to say "Prufrock the cat doesn't really miss us when we're gone, we're just anthropomorphizing" misses the point. For to apply psychological concepts like "missing" to Prufrock may well shed descriptive light on her behavior. In any case,, this "really" does as much work here as it does applied to a human being, which is</page><page sequence="10">100 ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Vol. 1, No. 2,1996 to say not very much. We say "Our little girl really misses us," and the force of this expression is either "Our little girl misses us," or "She misses us a great deal," but not "She has the inherent property of 'missing us,'" or "her presencing is currently in the flow of missing us." To recognize that anthropomorphizing is crucial to our description of what things do, yet undermines anthropocentrism, is to take responsibility for the ways in which we attempt to understand things.44 It is to take responsibility for the episteme which is to guide our moral actions. A Wittgensteinian episteme is grounded in the shift from static notions of what things are to dynamic notions about what things do. Innocuous though it appears, such a shift compels us to acknowledge contrary to deep ecology, not only that notions like inherent worth are human artifacts which tend to support human privilege, but that to abandon them is to abandon oppositions which have served us for so long. Within this episteme, we occupy no essentially human position, but rather the contextually complex positions of human language-users whose recognition of ourselves as such is an ethical act insofar as it prods us to recall that notions like thinking and hoping have no nonanthropomorphic applications. By the same token that we occupy no essentially human position within such an episteme, we also occupy no essentially male or female positions, but rather the socially, politically, and historically complex positions which continue to support the anthropocentrisrn/androcentrism dynamic.45 This is not to deny differences, but it is to deny that anything significant is accomplished by conceiving such dif ferences as essential. A Wittgensteinian ecofeminism, then, describes an ethical standpoint in which humans and nonhumans, men and women, are conceived not in terms of essential being, but rather in terms of the complex bio-socio-psycholog ical positions things occupy. Such a standpoint treats concepts traditionally applied only to humans literally as ways of describing the actions and behavior of things, that is, heuristically. Such an ethic is specifically feminist on at least two grounds: First, given the antliropocentrism/androcentrism dynamic, whatever blurs human-nature dis tinctions also blurs male-female distinctions. Second, and more importantly, to recognize the role anthropomo hizing plays with respect to describing is to rec ognize that the multiple positions occupied by things cannot be captured by ultimately simplistic notions like the feminine, but must rather be understood in terms of the myriad relationships and contextual complexities which inform behavior. As opposed to The Dawn of Anthropocentrism, a Wittgensteinian ecofeminism offers a new picture in which the unity in diversity envisioned by deep ecologists begins not with the extension of a human privilege which could always be withdrawn, but with the recognition that in our very attempt to describe what things do, we tacitly acknowledge the multiple ways in which we are alike and different from others. To make such acknowledgment explicit is an act which cannot be withdrawn, for to do this is not merely a political or ethi cal act, but an epistemic one requiring the willful forgetting of the</page><page sequence="11">Anthropomorphism Without Anthropocentrism 101 anthropocentrism embedded in the attempt to describe the behavior and actions of things. Such an episteme and ethic is well-suited to current discourse in feminism. For the concern to develop an ethic able to accommodate cultural and political dif ference is of a piece with the concern to develop an ethic sensitive to environmental destruction. Wittgensteinian ecofeminism prods us to take respon sibility not merely for our actions but for our episteme in the hope that by doing so we can construct an ethic in which value is embedded in the acknowledgment that what is deep about ecology consists in the entities that inhabit the ecosphere, just as what is deep about feminism consists in the women and men whose differences and similarities give this notion its life.
