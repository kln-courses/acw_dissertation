Authors should note these changes when preparing their manuscripts for submission. Quotations, single words, and phrases from Arabic, or other languages written in non-Roman alphabets, are transliterated according to the systems set out below. However, unless an author insists on a particular transliteration in all circumstances, place names and words from languages written in non-Roman alphabets which have entered English or French in a particular form (e.g. Mecca/ la Mecque, Mocha, Dhofar, qadi, wadi, imam/iman), are reproduced in that form when they are part of an English or French sentence, rather than part of a quotation in the original language or of a strictly transliterated name or phrase. For example: l."the settlement was built in the wadi bed" BUT "the settlement in Wadï Mayfacah 2. 'Timan alla à Médine" BUT "Imam cAlï vint de al-Madïnat al-Munawwarah" The transliteration systems are as follows: (a) Arabie * э £ j ^ dh си sh ^ ? &lt;Í q un M b С b J г о» s t c ^ к e h ^ t ¿ kh J z o^ d t gh à l j w ¿* th * d o» s Ь t ^ f ? m Я? У Vowels: a i u ã ï п. Diphthongs aw ay. Initial hamzah is omitted The lãm of the article is not assimilated before the "sun letters", thus al-shams not ash-shams. The hamzat al-wasl of the article is shown after vowels except after the preposition //-, as in the Arabic script, e.g. wa-4-wazJr, fi Ч-bayt, but H-l-wazJr. Tď marbutah (s) is rendered -ah in pause, e.g. birkah, zakãh, and -at before a vowel, e.g. birkat al-sibãhah, zakãt al- fitr. (b) Ancient North and South Arabian DbtthghddrzsJs2s3sdtzcgfqklmnhwy. (c) Other Semitic languages appear in the transliteration systems outlined in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 226 (1986), p. 3. (d) Persian, Urdu, and Ottoman Turkish as for Arabic with the additional letters transliterated according to the system in the Encyclopaedia of Islam (New Edition) except that z is used instead of zh.
