GENERAL Kramer, Hilton. "The MLA Centennial Follies." The New Criterion, 3 (January 1984), 1-8. During a session on "De- constructionism and the Fate of God" at the 1983 MLA convention, Kramer saw a possible religious significance of deconstructionism: "Suddenly . . . we understood what the title of this session really meant: God was indeed dead, and maybe literature was too, and for [the] panelists Derrida had taken their place." [DECR] Lundin, Roger. "Hermeneutics and the Romantic Tradi-</page><page sequence="4">84 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE tion." CSR, 13 (1983), 3-18. Modern hermeneutic philos- ophers illuminate the way Romantic critical doctrines have exalted literature and the imagination only by isolating poet and poem from such areas of discourse as science, morality, and religion. Theorists like Gadamer and Ricoeur also offer a corrective to Romantic formalism by attempt- ing to restore dialogue between art and the other realms of human concern. [RPK] ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL TO 1500: BIBLICAL LITERATURE Alter, Robert. "A Response to Critics." JSOT, 27 (1983), 113-17. Alter responds to critics of his Art of Biblical Narra- tive, who are also published in the same journal. He sees a "special fit between faith and art, one reinforcing and enriching the other." Opposes Jobling's comment that modern readers are so saturated by our technological world that they can read the biblical text from this per- spective only. Literary study has withstood the pressure to become one of the sciences humaines because there remains a fund of nontechnological readers. Alter eschews any involvement in dating the literature because of the tre- mendous flux in biblical scholarly opinions and sticks to those features about which verifiable and useful state- ments may be made. Barr, James. "Jowett and the Reading of the Bible 'Like Any Other Book.'" HBT, 4 (1982), 1-44. The alignment of Benjamin Jowett with the historical-critical quest for the original meaning is mistaken. Jowett could be considered an earlier ancestor of modern canonical criticism. Canoni- cal criticism gains some currency from the sense of the Bible as literature rather than as a body of historical evi- dence, and it is predominantly as literature that Jowett saw the Bible. Caspi, M. Mesori. "The Story of Dinah - Scripture, Reader, and Midrash." Beth Mikra, 28 (1982/83), 236-55 [in</page><page sequence="5">BIBLIOGRAPHY 85 Hebrew]. Uses the story in Genesis 34 to demonstrate the active relationship between the biblical text and the read- er's understanding, which is illustrated with several refer- ences to midrashic interpretations. Comparison with other biblical rape stories. Craven, Toni. Artistry and Faith in the Book of Judith. Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1983. Pp. 139. $11.25 (paper). Society of Biblical Literature members, $7.50. The bulk of the dis- sertation is devoted to literary analysis. The story is replete with irony and comedy. Judith stands for maintain- ing the "old ways" but does so by unconventional actions. She is not a permanent leader but represents a way to acquire permanent freedom. Dedmon, Robert. "Job as Holocaust Survivor." SL/T, 26 (1983), 165-85. Job is considered to be the survivor of the Holocaust. At stake is continued identity in Yahweh. The responses to Job's suffering by himself and by his friends may easily be understood as responses to the Holocaust. Among Jewish authors who have brought out the similar- ities between Job and the Holocaust are Eliezer Berkovits, Elie Wiesel, and Emil Fackenheim. Habel, Norman C. "The Narrative Art of Job: Applying the Principles of Robert Alter." ]SOT, 27 (1983), 101-11. Alter desires to understand the moral vision embodied in the biblical narrative by paying close attention to the literary artistry of the narrators. Thus Habel begins by applying the categories of "signals of continuity," which link text and frame by means of Job's blamelessness. The scene types studied by Alter in Genesis 12 suggest to Habel a similar artistry in the manner in which the author has painted Job's reduction from prosperity to the dung hill. Even Alter's discussion of the relationship of fiction to historiography sheds light on the quality of the book. In the end Alter's work poses a new challenge for the priority of "historical consciousness" as the principle gov- erning the interpretation of the biblical text. Hillers, Delbert R. "History and Poetry in Lamenta- tions." CurTM, 10 (1983), 155-61. Although the book was</page><page sequence="6">86 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE written in response to an overpowering historical event, it conveys practically no historical information. Rather, the cast of characters is reduced to Yahweh and Israel, and much of the action is shaped by "literary and religious tradition, not by observation." There is need of a recon- sideration of the supposed centrality of history in Old Testament religion. Janzen, J. Gerald. '"Samuel Opened the Doors of the House of Yahweh' (1 Samuel 3.15)." JSOT, 26 (1983), 89- 96. Following Robert Alter that there are virtually no "free motifs" in biblical narrative, Janzen suggests that the interplay of imagery in Chapter 1 holds the key. Yahweh had closed Hannah's womb; he heard her prayer and granted her Samuel. Chapter 3 begins with the notice that Yahweh had not given his word of late nor had any man a vision. Israel was spiritually barren. Then he opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Jobling, David. "Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narra- tive." JSOT, 27 (1983), 87-99. Reviews Alter from the per- spective of semiotics. Holds two caveats: scholars should not expect that the work will change the face of scholar- ship in a blink, and he expresses caution regarding Alter's too-naive acceptance of an early dating for some of the pre-exilic narratives. He also feels there is more common ground between Alter and the structuralists than Alter feels. Lindars, Barnabas. "Deborah's Song: Women in the Old Testament." BJRL, 65 (1983), 158-75. The prose story in Judges 4 and the poetry of Chapter 5 are complementary. In the prose story, the feminist theme is enunciated by the role of Deborah at the beginning: the prowess of a woman contrasts with the cowardly reluctance of Barak; then the story shows how Sisera is delivered over to Barak by the deed of the woman Jael. No moral considera- tion is raised; the story is simply for entertainment. The Story of Deborah also features women, but this time by contrasting Deborah the "mother in Israel" with the mother of Sisera, whose son and whose whole nation are ruined. Women appear in their own right, as equal agents,</page><page sequence="7">BIBLIOGRAPHY 87 capable of overcoming men other than by the exploitation of sexuality as in the Samson and Judith stories. Noweli, Irene. "The Book of Jonah: Repentance of Con- version." TBT, 21 (1983), 363-68. The book of Jonah is neither history, prophecy, nor a fish story. It is a parable of reversal, the conversion of the Ninevites, and the re- pentance of God. It is a didactic tale about the universal love of God. Whybray, R. N. "On Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narrative." JSOT, 27 (1983), 75-86. The relation between fiction and historiography in the narratives is described by Alter as both "historicized fiction" and "fictionalized his- tory." Alter does not devalue the historical fundament at all; he focuses on the artful use of such material by the narrator. What explains the sudden appearance of such superb literature? Alter responds that it is the unique character of the religious beliefs the narrator held. But although such beliefs may have given impetus to writing, they do not explain the art and skill of the author. Alter's preoccupation with the final text prevents him from per- ceiving a development of literary skill. Has Alter paved the way for a return to precriticai days? Of what value is source criticism, Traditionsgeschichte, or form criticism in the new wave? There is danger in assuming that the narra- tives are the work of a single brainchild. ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL TO 1500: LITERATURE OUTSIDE THE BIBLE Dutka, Joanna. "The Lost Dramatic Cycle of Norwich and the Grocers Play of The Fall of Man." RES, 35 (Feb. 1984), 1-13. Fragmentary versions of the play The Fall of Man are all that have survived of the Norwich mystery plays, yet they suggest a cycle of religious dramas per- formed in Norwich equal in their treatment of material to the better known plays of York, Chester, and Coventry. [LDC]</page><page sequence="8">88 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE Knapp, F. D. "Heilsgewissheit oder Resignation? Ren- newarts Schicksal und der Schluss des Willehalm." DVLG, Heft 4, (Dezember 1983). W. v. Eschenback by no means denies the absolute necessity of Christian faith for salva- tion. Rennewart is to typify the heathen tragically en- tangled in sinful compulsions of a misled conscience, from which he can free himself only by the grace of God. (RVD) Skey, Miriam Anne. "Herod, the Great, in Medieval European Drama." Comp D, 13 (1979/80), 330-64. Jose- phus's historical Herod was a good king who died a linger- ing death. He did not order the death of the innocents. Medieval continental drama portrayed Herod as a gracious king. The English Herod was a monstrous tyrant and slayer of children. Biblical versions influenced English drama. SIXTEENTH CENTURY Arbery, Glenn Cannon. "Women, Christianity, and the Stage in Four Shakespearean Comedies." DAI, 43 (1982), 1976A. Discusses dramatic art and Christianity in the heroines of The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, and Cymbeline. Astell, Ann W. "Sidney's Didactic Method in the Old Arcadia." SEL, 24 (Winter 1984), 39-51. Sidney's meaning and purpose are not carried in the surface structure of the language in Old Arcadia. Rather, he consciously intends that the reader unintentionally internalize the fiction with a resulting shock of surprise in self discovery, which leads to moral betterment. [HWM] Battenhouse, Roy. "King John: Shakespeare's Perspec- tive and Others." NDEJ, 14 (1982), 191-215. Attitude toward Catholicism is one of the matters considered in this comparison of King John with the anonymous Trouble- some Raigne of King John.</page><page sequence="9">BIBLIOGRAPHY 89 Bennett, Robert B. "Hamlet and the Burden of Knowl- edge." ShakS, 15 (1982), 77-97. Until his departure for En- gland Hamlet, in accordance with his Christian humanist training, holds his soul's safety as paramount and his engagement with worldly affairs an absolute obligation. Yet his experiences call into question whether the dual goals of spiritual purity and worldly service are compatible. Billingsley, Dale B. "The Messenger and the Reader in Thomas More's Dialogue Concerning Heresies." SEL, 24 (Win- ter 1984), 5-22. More uses interlocutors in the introduc- tory pages to establish a broad interpretive context for what follows. Through these he establishes paradoxes and contradictions and, most importantly, allows room for doubt, especially about the reliability of the messenger. This allows for a "recursive structure" "that returns to the center of belief again and again to answer the Mes- senger's questions" on doctrinal issues. [HWM] Crocker, Lester G. "The Merchant of Venice and Christian Conscience." Diogenes, No. 118 (1982), 77-102. The uneasi- ness of scholars and audiences at Shylock's treatment is traced to the workings of Christian conscience. Crump, Galbraith, M. "'This Frail and Worthless Trunk': The King's Ransome in Henry V." SPWVSRA, 7, No. 2 (1982), 92. Analyzes the theological and military aspects of ransom imagery from Richard II through Henry V to argue that Henry does not become the Christian king he attempts to be. Abstract of paper given at the annual meeting of the Shakespeare and Renaissance Association of West Virginia, April 1981. Edwards, Philip. "Tragic Balance in Hamlet." ShS, 36 (1983), 43-52. One cannot go forward in understanding the tragic quality of Hamlet if he does not recognize that this "is a religious play," and "The critical element in this tragic structure is the notion that God is neither absent nor obviously present." Kierkegaard's analysis of Abraham and Isaac is relevant: we must ask, is Hamlet's faith divine like Abraham's, or is it demoniac? Nineteenth-century criticism saw Hamlet as noble and his mission divine. Mid</page><page sequence="10">90 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE twentieth-century criticism is skeptical, feeling that the maintenance of society is the important point. "Hamlet vexed and troubled the world and failed to change it for the better. But he continues, or he ought to continue, to vex and trouble us with the suspicion, and the fear, that ... he may have been after something worth having. It is not faith we need to understand Hamlet, but doubt about our own skepticism." [RPD] Greenblatt, Stephen. "King Lear and Harsnett's 'Devil- Fiction.'" Genre, 15, Nos. 1-2 (1982), 239-42. Demonstrates parallels between Harsnett's Declaration (1603), an attack on exorcism as practiced by Jesuits to convert people to Catholicism with the help of stage plays, and King Lear, which is a secular version of the ritual of exorcism. Guilfoyle, Cherrell. '"Our Swete Sokor': The Role of Ophelia in Hamlet." Comp D, 14 (1980), 3-17. When Hamlet rejects Ophelia (her name means "succor" in Greek), he loses all hope. Ophelia represents purity and salvation. Her images - skull, book, herbs, water - are those of a repentant Magdalen. By scorning all women because of his mother's sins, Hamlet loses his only chance for sal- vation. Hunter, G. K. "Tyrant and Martyr: Religious Heroisms in Elizabethan Tragedy." In Poetic Traditions of the English Renaissance. Ed. Maynard Mack and George deForest. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982, pp. 85-102. Discusses Christian tragedy as oxymoron. Concerned with the "ex- tent to which the same values, the same emotional pat- terns, survive across historical discontinuity," and traces change in the dramatic tyrant as political values become independent of religious good. Kernberg, Otto F. "Adolescent Sexuality in the Light of Group Processes." Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 49 (1980), 27-47. Amid the violence and loss of identity that characterize large group processes evolving within an unstructured setting like Verona, Romeo and Juliet fulfill the group Messianic ideal by overcoming aggression through love</page><page sequence="11">BIBLIOGRAPHY 91 while at the same time arousing group envy and resent- ment. Laroque, Francois. "Pagan Ritual, Christian Liturgy, and Folk Customs in The Winter's Tale." CahiersE, 22 (Oct. 1982), 25-33. Studies the possible correlations between The Win- ter's Tale and the cycles of the year viewed, if not necessar- ily reconciled, in their pagan, Christian, and popular per- spectives. Levin, Carole. "The Historical Evolution of the Death of King John in Three Renaissance Plays." JRMMRA, 3 (1982), 85-106. Shakespeare removed the Christian images that surrounded John's death, emphasizing rather the duties of King and citizens. Rosenheim, Judith. "The Stoic Meaning of the Friar in Measure for Measure." ShakS, 15 (1982), 171-215. The Friar's providential nuances, despite his Christian habit, may reflect a stoic rather than a Christian idea of divinity, thus obviating the presumption of approval conceded to a Christian friar. Rothwell, Kenneth S. "Hamlet, Duplessis-Mornay, and the 'Irenie' Vision." HSt, 3 (1981), 13-31. Argues for Hamlet as a Christian warrior 'saved' by a Calvinist Deity who has granted the gift of prevenient grace," particularly as read against the background of French Calvinism and especially the work of the leading advocate of that cause, Philippe du Plessis de Mornay. Snyder, Susan. "Auden, Shakespeare, and the Defence of Poetry." ShS, 36 (1983), 29-37. After 1940 there was a tension between Auden the artist and Auden the Chris- tian, "a fear that poetry is in the religious sense beside the point." Auden turned to Shakespeare "as exemplifying a different art that sets against the Poet of the aesthetic way the Historian." For Auden there is ever a gap between conception and art. But for Shakespeare, "Hamlet's 'the rest is silence' is an end, not a beginning; by putting it 'on the other side of the wall' and equating it with 'ripeness'</page><page sequence="12">92 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE in King Lear, Auden makes Edgar's 'ripeness is all' refer not to rounding out our human life in awareness and accep- tance, but to completion in a truth beyond this world. Yet even Prospero's speech reducing our world to an insub- stantial pageant does not end with a transcendent reality in capital letters, but rather in a silence more noncomittal, and - again - more mysterious." [RPD] Simonds, Peggy Muñoz. "Overlooked Sources of the Bed Trick." ShQ, 34, No. 4 (Winter 1983), 433-34. Sug- gests Genesis 38 (the story of Judah and Tamar) as a source for the bed-trick convention in Shakespeare's All's Well that Ends Well and Measure for Measure. [RPD] Stewart, Stanley. "Sir Calidore and 'Closure.'" SEL, 24 (Winter 1984), 69-86. In establishing his argument that Book III of Spenser's Faerie Queene does not constitute the "closure" of a circular construction begun in Book I (nei- ther in plot nor theme), Stewart treats incidentally several Christian themes in the book, like Serena's sin, self- discovery, and restoration, and Calidore 's lesson to Briana to overcome pride and cruelty with humility. [HWM] Thome, W. B. "The Cycle of Sin in Shakespeare's Late Plays." UCrow, 4 (Fall 1982), 86-93. Demonstrates by com- parative analysis of Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, Pericles, and The Tempest that these four plays use the formula of sin- penance-regeneration, but with varying emphasis, each stressing different phases of the spiritual experience. Velz, John W. "From Jerusalem to Damascus: Biblical Dramaturgy in Medieval and Shakespearean Conversion Plays." CompD, 15 (1981/82), 311-26. Since the biblical conversion journey of St. Paul, dramatists intensify action by creating two sites and movement between them. Stage space in medieval religious drama assumes moral signifi- cance. Othello and Tempest emphasize on-stage action with a conversion journey between two locales. Biblical tech- niques are common in drama up to modern times.</page><page sequence="13">BIBLIOGRAPHY 93 SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Bligh, John. "Milton's Paradise Lost, VIII, 654-56." Expl, 42 (Winter 1984), 6-7. In explicating these lines from Paradise Lost, Bligh focuses on the word "occasionally," saying that it is probably taken from the Summa, la, 92,1. Milton's Adam means that, given Eve's superior gifts, "one might well think that man was made to be woman's helpmate and not vice versa." (RS,asc) Corns, Thomas M. "Milton's Quest for Respectability." MLR, 77 (October 1982), 769-79. Milton's divorce tracts made him obnoxious to moderate Puritans and drew printed attacks which generally branded him a licentious, shabby archetype of the ragged sectary. Milton took pains to obliterate this image by distancing himself from the sects in several ways. He shrewdly addressed pamphlets to Parliament and the Westminster Assembly, to curry favor with broadly orthodox Puritans. Even the publica- tion of his Poems in 1645 could have served the purpose of showing him as eminently respectable. Hunter, Jeanne Clayton. "'Mine-Thine' in Herbert's The Temple and St. John's Gospel." N&amp;Q, 29 (1982), 492-93. In at least eight poems, Herbert uses this rhyme climacti- cally, exemplifying Christ's language in John 16 that shows the relationship of God, Christ, and humankind. In Her- bert, these words (along with "me-thee") transcend "fig- ure and symbol to reveal . . . the mystery of salvation." Ide, Richard. "On the Begetting of the Son in Paradise Lost." SEL, 24 (Winter 1984), 141-55. Ide traces three tradi- tional interpretations of Psalm 2:7 and shows that Milton drew on each to insure that events in Books V and VI, the heavenly and earthly event of the begetting of the Son, were parallel, such that earth is a shadow of heaven. [HWM] Joscelyne, T. A. "George Herbert's The Windows : A Paral- lel in Barbaro's Vitruvius." N&amp;Q, 29 (1982), 493-94. The argument in this work involves two disparate traditions, both anthropomorphic and architectural: St. Paul's image</page><page sequence="14">94 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE of "temple" (individual and corporate) and the Renaissance theory of architecture found in Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius. Martz, Louis L. "Meditation as Poetic Strategy." MP, 80 (November 1982), 168-72. Martz holds that Barbara Le- walski's Protestant Poetics and the Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric overstates the thesis that the meditative current flowed more from contemporary English, Protestant sources than from continental Catholic methods of medi- tation. More likely, it stemmed from the impingement of Protestant and Catholic continental forces on pre-Reforma- tion English religion. Poets like Donne found room within the doctrinal variety of English Protestantism to articulate personal concern, but Lewalski undervalues this variety. Oram, William. "The Invocation of Sabrina." SEL, 24 (Winter 1984), 121-39. Tackling the 40-year-old critical debate which has failed to yield a unified interpretation of Comus, Oram concludes that Sabrina, "Milton's addition to the Circe myth," is the answer to "the central problem of the masque, that of how we are to value - and to use - the God-created, fallen world we inherit." [HWM] Pollock, Zailig. '"The Object and the Wit': The Smell of Donne's First Anniversary." ELR, 13, No. 3 (Autumn 1983), 301-18. A reading which sees the poem "as 'insanity'" rather than as ordered or conventional is "truer to our experience." The problem is to understand the relation between "'the object, and the wit.'" Following Aquinas, "it is the knowledge of God through God, in which the means of knowing and the thing known are indistinguishable that Donne refers to as 'both the object, and the wit.'" The wit of the Second Anniversary "directs us towards the moment when we see 'nothing but God and what is in him,"' but the Second Anniversary "explores 'all that we have made as though we saw, in this world.'" The object is Eliz- abeth Drury, and we can know her soul if we know our own. [RPD]</page><page sequence="15">BIBLIOGRAPHY 95 Tebeaux, Elizabeth. "John Donne and the Problem of Religious Authority: 'Wranglings that Tend Not to Edifi- cation."' SCB, 42 (Winter 1982), 137-43. Donne's treat- ment of reason and faith in the Sermons shadows his view of Scripture, the Church, and the broader issues of reli- gious authority, and many of his inconsistencies stem from difficulties inherent to Anglicanism. In general, he seems to regard reason as capable of leading man to God, yet incapable of more without the working of grace. Specifi- cally exempt from rational consideration are the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Resurrection. Toliver, Harold. "Herbert's Interim and Final Places." SEL, 24 (Winter 1984), 105-20. Throughout his poetry, Herbert searches both for a personal and social dwelling place and for places where God may dwell. Because of the "sinner's unworthiness and sense of lost paradise," he is constantly seeking to cross the gap through "sacramental manipulation of presence" which Herbert best achieves "in The Temple in general and in 'Love III' in particular" - a presence that represents "the final placement that consti- tutes bliss." [HWM] Verduin, Kathleen. "'Our Cursed Natures': Sexuality and the Puritan Conscience." NEQ, 56 (Jime 1983), 220- 37. The caricatures of Puritans as joyless, repressed elders or laughing, loving moderns oversimplify sexual anxieties and desires in their literature, especially sermons. Math- er's sermon "Warnings from the Dead" (1693) condemns marital "inordinate affections." John Williams' "Warning to the Unclean" (1698) stresses punishment. Other ser- mons present scriptural examples and express fear for New England or even recommend labor to control licen- tiousness. Edward Taylor's Meditations spiritualizes sexual- ity to symbolize surrender to the Bridegroom. Wooten, John. "From Purgatory to the Paradise of Fools: Dante, Ariosto, and Milton." ELH, 49 (Winter 1982), 741- 50. Milton's description of the Limbo of Vanity derives many of its features from Orlando Furioso. Because Ariosto here adapts Dante's Commedia, Milton assimilates Ariosto's satire to further debunk Dante's conceptions of Heaven,</page><page sequence="16">96 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE Purgatory, and Hell. Especially crucial are the parallels between Milton's and Dante's descriptions of St. Peter's Gate, suggesting that Milton's satire extends to Dante's theological outlook. EIGHTEENTH CENTURY Dilworth, Thomas. "Cowper's 'Lines Written During a Period of Insanity.'" Expl, 42 (Winter 1984), 8-10. Dilworth concentrates on the phrase "twice-betrayed Jesus" in line 7. The intimacy between Jesus and the poet is magnified in negative terms because the poet thinks Jesus abhors him. The positive aspect is present also, since both the poet and Jesus suffer. The conviction of damnation is not necessarily the judgment of God. (RS,asc) Griffin, Robert. "Pope, the Prophets, and The Dunciad." SEL, 23 (Summer 1983), 435-46. Pope's poetry in general ought to be read using "the Bible as a significant context for allusion," and The Dunciad in particular depends largely for its effect upon allusion to the Old Testament prophets, especially Moses, Elijah, and Isaiah. [HWM] Hammond, Jeffrey A. "Reading Taylor Exegetically: The Preparatory Meditations and the Commentary Tradition." TSLL, 24 (Winter 1982), 347-68. In Meditations 25 and 149 Taylor's seemingly arbitrary, strained, and abruptly shift- ing imagery becomes meaningful in the light of Samuel Mather's and others' commentaries on Numbers and the Canticles. In 25 the sacrifice signifies prayer and the Lord's Supper; in 149 the bride's navel, belly, and breasts repre- sent the benefits of the Supper. Kaiser, Leo M. "An Addendum to Jantz from Cotton Mather's Paternal NEQ, 55 (March 1982), 110-12. In Paterna a yet unanthologized, anonymous "Panegyrical Compo- sure" exemplifies the mastery of Latin composition in colonial writing.

Grace makes him shine faintly in the Lord's like- ness, so that sinners may see God's mercy. Stephanson, Raymond. ""Tis a speaking Sight': Imagery as Narrative Technique in Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year." DR, 62 (1982-83), 680-92. By treating the plague of 1665 as divine punishment for sin, Defoe hoped to move his contemporaries to repentance. To effect his purpose without "an officious canting of religious things," he made innovative use of imagery. Graphic details that horrify and sensitize are blended with biblical and emblematic images to convey the apocalyptic theme with immediacy, power, and subtlety. [RPK] NINETEENTH CENTURY Berkove, Lawrence I. '"The Minister's Black Veil': The Gloomy Moses of Milford." NHJ, 1978, pp. 147-57. The origin of Mr. Hooper's veil is traced back to Moses through 2 Corinthians 3 to Exodus. However, the minis- ter has selected only one aspect of Moses to emulate, taken it out of context, and "interpreted [it] in a way agreeable to his own temperament and experience." [MHM] Blythe, Hal, and Charlie Sweet. "The Structure of Browning's 'Soliloquey of the Spanish Cloister.'" SBHC, 8 (Fall 1980), 88-89. "The structure of the poem emphasizes the contrast between Brother Lawrence's ability and the narrator's inability to adjust to monastic life." Brooker, Jewel Spears. "The Dispensations of Art: Mal- larmé and the Fallen Reader." SoR, 19 (Winter 1983), 17- 38. Mallarmé holds that poetry must be read dispensa- tionally or in one way one time and in a different way at another time. The past and future ages are likened to Catholicism where poetry like the mass is a communal experience. The present, fallen age is related to Calvinism. "The Catholic notion assumes a worthy public which col-</page><page sequence="18">98 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE laborates in actualizing the poem; the Calvinist notion, a degenerative public is unfit to collaborate with the poet." [MHM] D'Avanzo, Mario L. "John Field's Well: The Biblical Con- text." MSE, 8, No. 2 (1982), 4-8. In Waiden, Thoreau draws on Ecclesiastes and the Gospel of John to illuminate the spiritual ruin symbolized by John Field's well; unlike the clear water of Waiden Pond, Field's well betokens spiritual murkiness. Fleissner, Robert F. "'Fancy's (K)nell' Retolled." DSN, 13 (Sept. 1982), 76-79. Little Nell's relation to earlier and later literature is worth re-examination, especially her re- lationship to Cordelia who was probably not intended as a Christ (or Mary) figure either. Flibbert, Joseph. "The Dream and Religious Faith in Herman Melville's Ciarei ." ATQ, No. 50 (Spring 1981), 129-37. "In Ciarei , Melville is attempting to resolve his own [religious] doubts and to undermine the rational basis for religious skepticism by showing that reason and the external senses are ineffective as transmitters of fact, real- ity and truth." Ultimately Ciarei discovers that one must accept both surface and inner realities and find religious truth through a kind of dream-vision. [MHM] Fulweiler, Howard W. "The Argument of 'The Ancient Sage': Tennyson and the Christian Intellectual Tradition." VP, 21 (Autumn 1983), 203-16. In "The Ancient Sage," Fulweiler perceives the attempt by Tennyson to support his religious faith through proof, comprehending that faith via reason and argument as well as by intuition and feel- ing. In his search for proof, Tennyson turns to the Chris- tian intellectual tradition "most often represented by the imaginative vision of St. John's Gospel and the Book of Revelation on the one hand and by the objective idealism of Plato and St. Augustine on the other" (204). In addi- tion, "The Ancient Sage" employs "the traditional culture of the east [the philosophy of Lao-Tze, which Tennyson was reading around the time of composition of "The</page><page sequence="19">BIBLIOGRAPHY 99 Ancient Sage"] not only for a vantage point from which to view modern Western civilization but also for a vehicle through which to express some aspects of Christian phi- losophy" (215), Tennyson adopting the dialectic techniques of Lao-Tze for his poem. [TG] Gollin, Rita K. "Hawthorne Contemplates the Shakers: 1831-1851." NH], 1978, pp. 57-65. Although Hawthorne seemed attracted to the Shakers in his first contacts with them, by 1851 he was devastating in his criticism of them. However, even in his two stories about them - "The Shaker Bridal" and "The Canterbury Pilgrims" - written near the time of his first contact, he does "pass strong judgments against them." Both stories "assert man's need for love as a condition for self-fulfillment" - something denied by the Shaker sect. [MHM] Kesterson, David B. "The Marble Faun as Transformation of Author and Age." NH], 1978, pp. 67-77. Evident in The Marble Faun are both "Hawthorne's artistic growth while in Italy" and "his reawakening to the efficacy of religion." Italy provided him with the perfect setting "to give full vent to his themes of the fall of man, the ambiguity of good and evil, the effect of sin on the individual and society, the violations of the human soul, and the crip- pling effects of isolation." [MHM] Lister, Paul A. "Some New Light on Hawthorne's The Marble Faun." NH], 1978, pp. 79-86. Much has been writ- ten about the Fortunate Fall as presented in Hawthorne's novel, but no one has recognized the work as "an allegori- cal representation of Christ's redemption of mankind from Satan." Given this new reading, the five major characters can be seen as follows: Kenyon as God the Father, Dona- tello as Christ, Hilda as the Holy Spirit, Miriam as man- kind, and the model as Satan. [MHM] Matheson, Terence J. "'Young Goodman Brown': Haw- thorne's Condemnation of Conformity." NH], 19 78, pp. 137-45. Most of Brown's speeches and actions are inter- preted as evidence of "preoccupation with social conven- tion, public appearance, and conformity." Even his resis-</page><page sequence="20">100 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE tance at the end to the Devil can be read as a fear of public exposure rather than as a sign of virtue. [MHM] Olpin, Larry. "Hyperbole and Abstraction: The Comedy of Emily Dickinson." DicS, 50 (Bonus 1984), 1-14. Chapter III, "God and Heaven," of Olpin's longer work is printed along with Chapter 4, "Dark Comedy," in this bonus issue. Olpin maintains that Dickinson depicts God as both human and divine. The familiar God is the God she makes fun of and likes, while the distant God is the one she tries to make fun of but fails in the attempt. The clash of these two views makes her concept of God and heaven humor- ous. (RS,asc) Parkinson, Thomas. "'When Lilacs Last in the Door- Yard Bloom'd' and the American Civil Religion." SoR, 19 (Winter 1983), 1-16. Whitman's poem can be considered as a part of the nonsectarian but deeply religious American tradition that includes The Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. Since Lincoln was shot on Good Friday, Whitman could easily have treated him as a Christian archetype in the poem, but instead he neither makes direct mention of Lincoln nor of Christian ritual or dogma. Rather than writing an elegy on Lincoln, Whitman created "a nocturne for the nation," a contribution to American Civil Religion. [MHM] Scheuermann, Mona. "The American Novel of Seduc- tion: An Explanation of the Omission of the Sex Act in The Scarlet Letter." NH], 1978, pp. 105-18. Early American novels of seduction, in contrast with English ones, have the seduction occur early in the novel and then concen- trate on the psychological effects of it. Hawthorne's novel even follows the pattern to some extent. The cultural influence of Puritanism in America is an important factor in this difference between American and English novels. Since Puritanism furnishes "no outlet for the remission of sin," "the aftermath of an act is important because eter- nal." [MHM] Waldinger, Albert. "The Full Covenant: Father Mapple's Sermon in Hebrew." ATQ, No. 50 (Spring 1981), 105-16.</page><page sequence="21">BIBLIOGRAPHY 101 The prophetic tone of Father Mapple's sermon in Mel- ville's Moby-Dick is heightened by translation into the lan- guage of the "old Covenant." Such a reading provides "the possibility of revealing Moby-Dick's latent content, a con- tent vyhich supplies the underpinning of his [Melville's] own 'new Covenant' religion." [MHM] Young, William A. "Leviathan in the Book of Job and Moby-Dick." Sou, 65 (1983), 388-401. Discusses Melville as biblical interpreter in Moby-Dick. In his combination of orthodox and critical approaches to the Bible, Melville penetrated to the timelessness of Job and made its themes meaningful. "Just as the Book of Job dramatizes the col- lapse of world views based on the monotheistic theory of retribution or polytheistic myth so dominant in the ancient world, Moby-Dick enacts the failure of both the orthodox Calvinist view of divine retribution and the distinctly American myth." TWENTIETH CENTURY Barlow, Michael. "Gilbert Cesbron, Christian Writer." Renascence, 36 (1983-84), 67-76. Although Cesbron is a Christian writer (essays, novels, plays, poetry), he is "not out to make converts or to use his writings as a platform for spreading the Word." [PWN] Brivic, Sheldon. "The Mind Factory: Kabbalah in Finne- gans Wake." ]]Q, 21 (Fall 1983), 7-30. Deals with Joyce's Tree of Life, "the central pictogram of the Jewish system of knowledge of God called the Kabbalah," in the "Study Period" chapter of Finnegans Wake, II. 2. [TG] Bichelberger, Roger. "Jean Sullivan, A Christian Wit- ness for Our Times." Renascence, 36 (1983-84), 55-66. An overview of the life and writings of Jean Sullivan, essay- ist, novelist, priest, committed Christian. [PWN] Burshatin, Israel. "Power, Discourse, and Metaphor in</page><page sequence="22">102 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE the Abencerraje." MLN, 99 (March 1984), 195-213. Abencer- raje is a role-model for Christian-Moorish relations "more tolerant than the world which produced the tale." [HWM] Clapp, Rodney. "The Generous Critic: John Updike." ChT, 28 (March 2, 1984), 87-8. Updike's recent collection of essays, Hugging the Shore, reflects fine craftsmanship in style as well as confident and acute insight into the writ- ers (mainly American novelists) discussed. His criticism, while always alert to the human and literary flaws of these writers, remains distinctly sympathetic in spirit. These essays include illuminating comment about the effects of Christian faith on American writers and about the implications of such faith for his own philosophy of fiction writing. [HG] Conner, Patrick W. "Bloom, the Masons and the Ben- stock Connection." JJQ, 17 (1980), 217-20. In Joyce's Ulysses, it seems unlikely that Bloom was expelled from the Masons because of selling Hungarian lottery tickets. The Catholic Church does not sanction the Masons, and in order to marry Molly, a convert such as Bloom would be told to end his membership. Bloom's abandoning of the Masons heightens his spiritual impotence - born a Jew, made a Protestant by his father, and converted to Cathol- icism by Molly. Cronin, Edward J. "The Mystery of the Lost Key(s)." JJQ, 17 (1980), 216-17. In Joyce's Ulysses, since Bloom thinks he saw Martha in church, she is probably a Catholic and her "other world" is Hell. Fargnoli, A. Nicholas. "A-taufing in the Wake: Joyce's Baptismal Motif." JJQ, 20 (1983), 293-305. In Finnegans Wake the sacrament of baptism provides not only imagery but also insight into the theme of the artist as creator. The baptismal motif includes the consecration of the artist's ink; the rebirth of the artist, which is made anala- gous to that of Christ on the cross; the new cosmogony of the artist; the baptism of the reader into the mystery of art; and the revitalization through the living water of the Liffey.</page><page sequence="23">BIBLIOGRAPHY 103 Favre, Yves-Alain. "Patrice de La Tour du Pin: The Renaissance of a Liturgical Poetry." Renascence, 36 (1983- 84), 45-54. An overview of the poetic works of La Tour du Pin, showing how he comes, finally, to a liturgical po- etry which fuses "the art of poetic creation and the spiri- tual quest." [PWN] Giannone, Richard. "'The Artificial Nigger' and the Re- demptive Quality of Suffering." FOBull, 12 (1983), 5-16. Argues that Mr. Head "learns the lesson of the cross. . . . [which] changes his attitude toward himself, toward ev- eryone, and toward God." [PWN] King, Richard. "Memory and Phantasy." MLN, 98 (Spe- cial Number, December 1983), 1197-1213. The latter third of King's article treats Freud's handling of Moses and Jew- ish history in Freud's Moses and Monotheism. According to Freud, Moses treated Jewish history as a "screen memory" and reconstructed his text to accommodate psychologically necessary repressions. King notes that Freud is guilty of the same kind of distortion with which he accuses Moses, as in Freud's confounding of act and phantasy as equiva- lent acts of repression. [HWM] Kushner, Eva. "Pierre Emmanuel and the Quest for Unity." Renascence, 36 (1983-84), 17-25. Traces the chang- ing emphasis in Emmanuel's poetic search for unity. "Sep- arateness" is a major factor in his poetry, especially es- trangement from God. [PWN] Leonski, D. S. "'The Symbolism of the Early Yeats: Occult and Religious Backgrounds.'" SLitI, 24 (Spring 1981), 85-100. Yeats's explanation of Blake's system of correspondence, which Yeats in the main accepted, in- volves several Christian concepts and symbols. The lower orders derive from the higher, which is of "God, eternal and infinite." By the end of his career, Yeats came to believe that symbolism was no longer "merely correspon- dence, but ... a state of mind, movement of thought, and an aesthetic and religious technique." [HWM] Murphy, Russell E. "The 'Rough Beast' and Historical</page><page sequence="24">104 CHRISTIANITY &amp; LITERATURE Necessity: A New Consideration of Yeats's 'The ¡Second Coming.'" SLitI, 24 (Spring 1981), 101-10. With supporting evidence from historical events and Yeats's contemporary thinkers, but leaning mainly on the system Yeats develops in "A Vision," "The Second Coming" predicts the blossom- ing perfectability and divinity in man, using the biblical account of Christ, Antichrist, and the Apocalypse as sym- bolic referents. [HWM] O'Connell, David. "Michel de Saint Pierre and the De- fense of Traditional Values." Renascence, 36 (1983-84), 88- 106. One of the most widely read authors of his genera- tion, Saint Pierre writes from the perspective of a "con- vinced Catholic for whom all the dogmas of the church are true." The essay provides an overview of his life and an introduction to his novels and nonfiction. [PWN] Restuccia, Frances L. "Not Foreknowledge, Simply Knowl- edge: Secular Typology in Ulysses." J]Q, 20 (1983), 429-42. Joyce, who attached great significance to scriptural fulfill- ment in the Bible, developed a secular use of it in Ulysses. In both plot and language he repeated situations and phrasing to throw new meaning into an established usage, but without abandoning the original meaning. Rodden, John. "Orwell on Religion: The Catholic and Jewish Questions." CollL, 11 (1984), 44-58. Although Or- well was skeptical of or even hostile toward religious faith, both Jews and Catholics often accept him as a fellow- traveller. [PWN] Sabre, Jeannette M. "The Sacred Wood in Three Twen- tieth-Century Narratives." CSR, 13 (1983), 34-47. Con- temporary writers continue to employ the resonant topos of the mythic forest to embody values beyond the histori- cal and profane. Paradigmatic uses include symbolizing a transcendent spiritual reality (Mircea Eliade, The Forbidden Forest), portraying the guiding and transforming energies of the imagination (John Fowles, Daniel Martin), and mir- roring the wilderness within (Joseph Conrad, The Heart of Darkness).

"Flannery O'Connor's Spiritual Landscape: A Dual Sense of Nothing." FOBull, 12 (1983), 17-34. Drawing illustrations from a number of stories, the author argues that O'Connor's landscapes function as "re- flections and agents of redemption . . . [and] cosmic spec- tators." [PWN] Shanahan, Dennis M. "The Way of the Cross in Ulysses." ]]Q, 20 (1983), 275-91. From "Calypso" to "Ithaca" the events in Bloom's day parallel the 14 stages in the Way or Stations of the Cross, as celebrated in Catholic churches. These images of Christ's suffering and death provide a significance for Joyce which can be traced in detail, though as with those from Homer the meaning is often oblique. The life of the artist as presented resembles the life of the spiritual man. Thorne, T. A. "Elements of Wonder in Arthur Adam- son's Poetry." ECW, 18/19 (1980), 216-22. Adamson's archetypal vision in The Inside Animal is rooted in Christian and Greek mythologies; it is also drawn from Romantic thought, especially Blake. The book's movement is unified by recurring images of water, air, earth, fire, and sunlight. Whitehouse, J. C. "Maurice Clavel: God or Nothing." Renanscence, 36 (1983-84), 35-44. Examination of several of Clavel's novels. Argues that in the world of these novels humans cry out for meaning and that "hope is the basis for the theological element" in his works.
