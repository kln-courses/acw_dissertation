<plain_text><page sequence="1">A KOKOPELLI EFFIGY PITCHER FROM NORTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO MARJORIE F. LAMBERT ABSTRACT Since effigy vessel forms and anthropomorphic and/or realistic designs on pottery are rare in the prehistoric northern Anasazi area, the Gallup Black-on-white vessel herein reported is extraordinary in that it combines a large so-called bird-form pitcher with both modeled and painted characteristics of Kokopelli, the Humpbacked Flute Player. The vessel, dating ca. A.D. 1000-1150, came from an unnamed Pueblo III site, southwest of the Chaco Canyon, near the McKinley-Sandoval County line, north- western New Mexico. THE UNIQUE Gallup Black-on-white effigy vessel herein described was lent to the Museum of New Mexico's Division of Research by the owners, Mr. William Littrell, Superintendent, Philmont Scout Ranch, New Mexico, and his wife, so that the writer could study and record it. The pitcher was recovered from a burned room in a stone masonry site in northwestern New Mexico, some distance south and east of the Chaco Canyon proper, near the McKinley-Sandoval County line. The owners have par- tially restored the specimen; at present it is approximately two-thirds complete. A piece is missing from the neck, and another from the under part of one side. One of the modeled arms also lacks a small section. Anthromorphic vessel forms and realistic pottery designs are uncommon in the prehistoric Anasazi area. This vessel is extraordinary in that it combines an unusu- ally large bird-form pitcher with most of the attributes of Kokopelli, the Humpbacked Flute Player, modeled and painted on it. This deity concept is one of very ancient origin in the Southwest, but it is still recognized, or per- sonified, today in both New Mexico and Arizona Puebloan pantheons and rituals. Since Gallup Black-on-white pot- tery was a relatively common type in early and middle Pueblo III times, ca. A.D. 1000-1150, in the Chaco Canyon and adjoining areas, it may be assumed that this vessel was made and was in use during the 11th or early 12th century. VESSEL FEATURES AND DECORATION The measurements of the pitcher are: length, 113/4 in.; width at shoulders, 8?/4 in.; width at body center, 71/2 in.; height, 95/8 in.; diameter of orifice, 4 -A5 in.</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS 399 An unembellished hollow flute, about an inch in diameter, extends diagonally from below the neck open- ing to the tail of the vessel. It is 61/4 in. long and opens into the interior at the neck and lower extremity. The flute is attached to the neck 1?/4 in. below the rim and is similarly connected to the body 2-iA in. from the end of the tail. The flute player's arms are modeled from two ropes of clay, the upper portions of which are molded to the shoulders. They extend from either side of the vessel body, with the hands resting on the flute in playing posi- tion. The hands are graphically portrayed, the left one with five fingers, and the right with six. Each finger has a vertical black band painted on it. The right arm is decorated with eight narrow, horizontal black lines approximately 5/8 in. apart. The left arm has nine similar black bands, about 1/4 in. apart. In addition, each wrist has a black band on the outer side about 3/8 in. wide. This arm embellishment is similar to that of the Kossa and Koshare dancers in Pueblo Indian ceremonies today. A squatting human effigy vessel from Chaco Canyon described by Pepper (1906: 329, P1. XXIX) also has arm bands, but these are differently spaced and of greater number. Kokopelli and Kossa katchinas which have been seen by the writer not only have encircling black body bands, but they are often adorned with black arm bands almost identical to those of this vessel. The surface appearance of the pitcher indicates extensive usage before final breakage. Both the slip and design are worn-through in places, and there are a number of chipped areas. The heavy lined design, executed in a dull black iron paint, occurs for the most part on the upper portion of the body, extending below in only two instances. The exterior surface is covered with a streaked, uneven, dirty white slip. The neck interior has been partially covered with random swipes of the potter's slipping mop. The two most interesting painted designs are a pair of human figures done in solid black. These appear on either side of the body with heads toward the vessel shoulders and feet extending inward toward the center. The one on the right is a male, and the one on the left a female (Fig. 1). The head of the male is square, while that of the female is round. Both appear to be wearing large ear-pendants of similar type. That these may also repre- sent a hair style then in fashion is another possibility. The male's arms are held straight out, with lower arms pointing downward forming right angles. The legs are painted in like manner; a vertical black line on the lower body indicates the sexual organ. The left foot has only four toes; the right foot is worn off. The female's legs are similarly depicted; her left toes are missing. The arms curve inward toward the body, and no hands are shown. The bodies of both individuals are very long in propor- tion to other features shown and are suggestive of numer- ous prehistoric Puebloan petroglyphs. The writer believes that these figures are intended to represent Kokopelli and his female counterpart, Kokopelli mana, the mean- ing of which will be discussed later. Other decorations are as follows: A thin black line encircles the rim of the orifice. Below it, surrounding position on the flute .Also depicted are painted figures of KokopeSi. and Kokopelli manai the neck, is a continuous band design consisting of inverted, or suspended, hatched triangles, the tips of which are painted solid black. The design is tied into the body decoration by means of two vertical hachured stems at the back of the vessel neck. The body decora- tion is comprised of heavily hachured wide bands with standing triangular motifs similar to those on the neck. INTERPRETATION The most unique features of this vessel are the form and the typical Humpbacked Flute Player attributes painted and sculptured upon it. The general appearance also suggests some of the Mesoamerican whistling pots, which is not surprising in view of the fact that many prehistoric cultural traits are derived from Mexico. In addition to the flute, one of the major characteristics of the prehistoric Kokopelli personage is the hump on the back, hence the name "Humpbacked Flute Player." Wherever these beings have been depicted, they are gen-</page><page sequence="3">400 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 3, 1967 of the underside which represents the humped back erally portrayed upright, walking, engaged in a ceremonial dance; when shown with bow and arrow as well as with flute and grouped with animals, they are hunters. In rare instances are they shown in a seated position or lying on their backs. Thus this vessel is unusual in that it is a ceramic portrayal of Kokopelli lying on his back while playing a flute; apparently the rounded contour of the underside is intended to represent the humped back (Fig. 2). It is also probable that the maker of this vessel did not intend it to represent a bird form. Both archaeolog- ical and ethnological data indicate that Kokopelli was, and is, an insect-being wtih multiple attributes (Fewkes 1903: 86; Lambert 1957: 100-03, and Fig. 3; Parsons 1938: 337-8; Renaud 1948: Pls. III-2, V-1 and 4; also extant katchinas and hundreds of Southwestern petro- glyphs). Those of us living in the Southwest are well aware of the great importance of the flute in the ceremonial and esthetic life of both prehistoric and present day New Mexico and Arizona Indians. These are shown in numer- ous rock pictures and are to be noted occasionally as designs on pottery; also, hundreds of whistles, flutes, and/or flageolets have been recovered from pre-Spanish sites. Ceremonies in which the flute is regularly used are still carried on in pueblos of both New Mexico and Arizona. Of the importance of the flute and "locust" among the Hopi, Parsons (1938: 337-8) says, Locust is the musical and curing patron of the Hopi Flute societies. He is represented playing the flute on Flute altar tiles. Hopi have Locust medicine for wounds, inferably belonging to the Flute so- cieties. . . . When Locust was sent up from below to scout for an exit into the upper world, the Clouds shot their bolts through him and he just went on playing his flute. In another version, after the Emergence when Locust was shot with arrows he died and then came back to life. Locust, the unwinking, is a brave man, a suitable patron for societies that cure for lightning shock, and, inferably, for arrows and gun wounds. Kokopelli portrayals are generally strongly phallic, since this deity has a major role in all rites concerned with fecundity, or increase and fertility. He is a hunter and has the power of keeping game animals fertile. With his flute he helps bring rain necessary for the maturing of corn and other crops. Kokopelli mana, the female, is also symbolical of fertility, and frequently, when seen, "She carries in her hands two small parcels of food, made of (corn) mush, wrapped in corn husk" (Fewkes 1903: 86). With reference to the two black human figures painted on this vessel, the following quotation is pertinent, The Hopi call a certain dipterous insect Kokopelli. . . . The head is painted black and has a white median facial line. The snout is long, pointed, and striped black and white. On each side of the head is a white circle with diametrical lines drawn in black, and there is a warrior feather on top. The body is black and girt by an embroidered sash (Fewkes 1903: 86, P1. XXV). Attention is also called to the fact that numerous Hopi Kokopelli katchinas of today are similarly depicted. A number of researchers also state that the protrusions on the heads of many Kokopelli petroglyphs may possibly represent insect antennae, rather than animal ears or feathers. The writer has also been given similar informa- tion by Keres and Tewa Indians. The Kokopelli personage sometimes depicted as a hunter and/or courter of maidens in prehistoric South- western rock art also has a modern counterpart: At Hano Kokopelli is equated with Nepokwa'i, "a big black man" (Kokopelli's mask and body are painted black) who in the tales appears with a buckskin on his back from which to make moccasins for the bride (Parsons 1938: 337). CONCLUSION This effigy pitcher is another link in the chain of evi- dence which points to the prehistoric Humpbacked Flute Player as the ancestor of the modern Kokopelli and the Tewa Nepokwa'i. In a previous paper the writer stated that archaeological and ethnological evidence suggests Mexican antecedents for this deity, as well as for a num- ber of other Southwestern Indian supernaturals (Lambert 1957: 106-07): It may be that in a remote period of Southwestern prehistory there were only one or two recognized deities, and that the pantheon increased as the Pueblo culture became more complex. The God of Fire and the Humpbacked Flute Player could very well be the oldest in concept among the archaeological supernaturals. It is also important to remember that . . . anthropomorphs are still in use in a number of pueblos. Their magical powers are still recognized, particularly with reference to rainfall, and crop, and human fertility. The attributes of this vessel, both in form and decora- tion, leave no doubt as to its identification. Considering Kokopelli's role as a hunter, rain maker, and as a person- age concerned with the growing of crops, and human and animal fecundity, it may be safely assumed that this ves- sel was used in ceremonies or rites associated with the Kokopelli Cult. That its magical powers were frequently invoked during the 11th or 12th century before breakage occurred is attested by the worn and damaged areas on the surface.</page><page sequence="4">FACTS AND COMMENTS 401 FEWKES, J.
