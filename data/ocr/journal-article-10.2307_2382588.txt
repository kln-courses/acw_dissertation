<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meaning of Kami Chapter II Interpretations by Japanese Writers By D. C. H o l t o m, Yokohama. The next step in our study of the meaning of kami carries us into the examination of the form of explanation advanced by certain re- presentative Japanese scholars. In this way we place ourselves in a posi- tion to supplement the etymological conclusions already passed in review with a knowledge of the nature of the synthesis which Japanese investiga- tors have arrived at on the basis of their studies of the specific usages of the term, past and present. Although the views of only a few men can be noted here, out of almost unlimited possibilities, yet it is believed that the ones selected are of sufficient importance to justify the choice. Their ideas are of value to us not merely because they acquaint us with the views of Japanese experts on the subject, but also because they suggest problems to be explored and at the same time indicate to a certain extent sources to be consulted for original data. The first exposition of the meaning of kami to be presented for consideration here is taken from the new Shinto Encyclopaedia,i) now in process of publication by a group of Japanese scholars. It is written by the well known contemporary Shinto authority, Dr. Saeki Ariyoshi.2) The fact that it appears in a compilation of scholarly discussions intend- ed to guide the Japanese people themselves in their search for information regarding Shinto is, in and of itself, justification for making reference to it. While there are certain statements in Dr. Saeki's account that must be taken merely as the personal opinion of the author, yet on the whole it may be accepted as authoritative for the general point of view of the majority of Shinto writers of today, especially in its prepossessions in favor of ancestor worship as the major element in the Shinto god-idea. A noteworthy feature of Dr. Saeki's exposition, and an added reason for giving it our attention, lies in the fact that it incorporates the account of the meaning of kami advanced by the great eighteenth century scholar, 2) {t- M.</page><page sequence="2">393 The Meaning of Kami 33 Motoori Norinaga. Notwithstanding the fact that Motoori's statement was written so long ago, it still may be accepted as one of the most penetra- ting expositions of the meaning of kami to be found in the entire range of Japanese literature. It is significant that Motoori, with all of his profound knowledge of the Japanese classics, makes no attempt to account for ety- mological origins. It is also of considerable interest to note the points on which Dr. Saeki challenges Motoori's views. Dr. Saeki says: Kami. As a general idea this means a personal and transcendent awe-in- spiring spirit which is made the object of religious worship.3) In very ancient times in our country natural phenomena or objects of nature that stimulated wonder were felt to contain marvelous power and were looked upon as kami. This next developed into the idea of the worship as kami of the spiritual powers4) that control these [natural] objects and act upon them. This in time became the worship of the power of kami who confer favors on human life in the form of continuous and renewing development. Gradually the evil kami who inflict mis- fortune on mankind are sifted out and we reach the existence of a world of dei- ties ruled over by a pure and supreme divine spirit. Takama-ga-Hara5) is the name for such a world. Here numerous deities, nutmbered at eighty myriads or eight hundred myriads, under the divine command of Amaterasu-Omikami, who is the absolute and supreme administrative Kami, exercise guardianship over the nation and its people. In this sense the activity of the good and upright kami centers in the supreme divine power of Amaterasu-Omikami. The Kogosh-i6) says, " Amaterasu-Omikami is a true ancestress. She is our true source. Her majesty is without equal. All the other kami are her subordinates and her follow- ers. "7) This relationship is set forth clearly in these words. The fact that the Emperors are called " Living Kami "8) is because they preserve the divine succes- sion of this majestic deity. 3) , _ The translator is in some doubt as to whether to take this in a pantheistic or in an animistic sense. Inasmuch, however, as the author clearly identifies the kami-idea of Shint6 with polytheism, the latter course has been adopted. Hence the translation introduces the indefinite article before the word " personal." WVhile this is not in the original text, it does seem to be required in the English rendering in order to make the opening sentence consistent with the rest of the discussion. 4) a - 5) In its original significance Takama-ga-Hara, or the Plain of High Heaven, was undoubtedly merely the world of the firmament or the upper sky. 6) .

Holtom 394 From ancient times onward, beginning with the Grand Shrine of Ise,9) shrines have been established throughout the country in each district, city, town and vil- lage, and the deities worshipped therein are many. If we group them in classes we find that individual ancestors who are worshipped as kami are most nume- rous. In addition to these there are numerous kami who are worshipped as the spiritual powers that guard the necessities of life.'0) In foreign countries a sing- le sovereign God is recognized and apart therefrom no other gods are known. In our country, however, not only are deities of creation worshipped, but also it is believed that spirit exists in all things and this is revered as kami."1) Further- more, the spirits of the dead are exalted and worshipped as kami. Those who have given their lives in the service of the state are worshipped as kami by the state. There are also cases 'in which people who excel in virtue are worshipped as kami while still living. Thus the kami of Japan are many and to explain them is a matter of great difficulty. Although Motoori Norinaga does not give a [final] explanation of the problem of what the kami are, yet in his Kojiki Den he first [among scholars] explains this subject. In Book III of this writing he says: " Speaking in general it may be said that kami signifies, in the first place, the deities of heaven and earth'2) that appear in the ancient records and also the spirits of the shrines where they are worshipped.'3) It is hardly necessary to say that it includes human beings. It also includes such things as birds, beasts, trees, plants, seas, mountains, and so forth. Anything whatsoever which was outside of the ordinary, which possessed superior power, or which was awe-inspiring, was called kami.14) Thus the kami are of many kinds. Some are noble, some are base ; some are strong, some are weak ; some are good, some are bad. They are diverse in heart and deed, and thus, since they are of various sorts, it is a matter of great difficulty to set them all in a single line." This is what he [Motoori] says and then he further explains his analysis as follows: " Eminence does not here refer merely to the superiority of nobility, good- ness, or meritorious deeds. Evil and mysterious things, if they are extraordinary and dreadful, are called kami. It is needless to say that among human beings who are called kami, the successive generations of Sacred Emperors are all in- cluded. The fact that Emperors are called ' Distant Kami '15) is because from the point of view of common people, they are far-separated, majestic and worthy of 9) This cannot be taken in a temporal sense.

In a lesser degree we find, in the present as well as in ancient times, human beings who are kami. Although they may not be accepted throughout the whole country, yet in each province, each village and each family there are human beings who are kami, each one according to his own proper station. The kami of the divine age were for the most part human beings of that time and since the people of that time were all kami, it is called the Age of the Gods. "Furthermore, among things which are not human, the thunder is always called 'sounding kami.' Objects like dragons, the echo,'6) and foxes, inasnruch as they are conspicuous, wonderful and awe-inspiring, are also kami. In popular usage the echo is said to be a tengu'7) and in Chinese writings it is referred to as a mountain goblin.'8) " In the Nihongi and the Manyoshui the tiger and the wolf are also spoken of as kami. Again, there are the cases in which peaches were given the name Au- gust-Thing-Great-Kamu-Fruit'9) and a necklace was called August-Storehouse- shelf-Kami.20) There are further examples in which rocks, stumps of trees and leaves of plants spoke audibly. These were all kami. There are, again, numerous places in which seas and mountains are called kami. This does not have reference to the spirit of the mountain or the sea, but kami is used here directly of the particular mountain or sea. This is because they were exceedingly awe-inspir- ing." At this point Dr. Saeki ends his quotation from Motoori. He then turns to the criticism of certain of Motoori's conclusions with the follow ing words: What he [Motoori[ says presents a reasonable view of the matter based on a broad comprehension of the facts. Yet there are points in it that raise ques- tions: 1. The first relates to the distinction between kami and men. Motoori says, " The kami of the Divine Age were for the most part human beings of that time, and, since the people of that age were all kami, it is called the Age of the Gods." Although it is a fact that human beings must have been numerous in the Age of the Gods, yet unless we can make a clear distinction in the matter of the extent to which people existed and that to which kami existed, the discussion re- mains forever indefinite. How shall we deal with this matter ? It is a problem 16) R, Kodama, " tree spirit." This is a common word for the echo. 17) 3Z.

The kamu-quality of the peach was undoubtedly associated with the magical properties attributed to it. These proper- ties may have arisen through a female sex symbolism. See Aston, Nihongi, V61.

The kami- quality here again probably resides in the magical potency originally attributed to the regalia emblems.</page><page sequence="5">36 D. C. Holtom 396 of unusual difficulty. 2. The second point concerns the fact that dragons, the tengu and foxes are regarded as kami. This Motoori explains without the least hesitancy as a belief that existed in Japan from the most ancient times. All of these beliefs arose, however, as the result of the influence of Chinese and Buddhist thought. They are forms of thinking that began with the Heian Era [794-857 A.D.]. The fact that Motoori accepted these beliefs without question and advanced no argu- ment against them reveals a tendency on his part to fall into the error of stimu- lating superstition. 3. In the third place there is the issue regarding beliefs relating to nature worship connected with mountains, seas, and so forth. It is true that in the Manyoshut there are poems that speak of Mount Fuji,21) Mount Miwa,22) and Mount Yahiko23) and also of the Susu Sea24) as kami, but this is in order to sing the praises of mountains and seas and is not necessarily a proof that these moun- tains and seas were worshipped as kami. Mistakes arise unless we can get an ex- planation of the relation of mountain deities and sea deities to mountains and seas. There are many cases in which conclusions regarding the classics should come up for reappraisal. If we raise the question as to how we can elucidate the fundamental nature of the [ancient] kami, we should consider the following: The early classics like the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki present the traditions regardino the krn?i. The Norito, of the Fngishiki25) set forth the beliefs that were held concerning them. The ShimmydchOl26) (" Registry of Shinto Shrines ") of the Engishiki makes plain the shrines that were honored at the time, (and although it is possible that the beliefs that were connected with them may have already fallen into decay, yet it is evident that formerly they were revered). Accordingly, if we analyze the deities worshipped in the Shimmyocho, we can learn what kinds of kami were believed in. Then, if we study these in comparison with the ancient classics, commencing with the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, we are able to arrive at an understanding of the fundamental nature of the kami. To state briefly the results of this study: among the kami of our country ancestral deities were most numerous, but nature deities were also worshipped. In the present, however, ancestral deities have been transformed into tutelary deities (ujigami).27) Also, there is a large and growing number of kami made up of those who have won merit through the sacrifice of their lives for their country. In Europe monotheism flourishes and polytheism has declined. In Japan, however, in spite of the influence of foreign thought, polytheism has not declined 21) Here written 714X14. 22) -"1}.

What Saeki seems to mean here is that ancestral gods which formerly had a more general association are now claimed as the guardian deities of special families.</page><page sequence="6">397 The Meaning of Kami 37 but has survived right up to the present. This is due to the nature of our na- tional structure (kokutai).28) The above outline of the meaning and main historical usages of kami calls for certain observations by way of elucidation and criticism. It is significant that Dr. Saeki, in spite of an obvious tendency to idealize even the most primitive levels of thought that appear in the ancient re- cords, recognizes a series of fairly definite stages in the evolution of the characteristic Japanese god-idea. The author begins his account of the historical development through which the conception of kami has passed by asserting the existence of an initial stage in which inanimate objects that stimulated wonder and admiration were immediately perceived as kami, that is, as sacred and set apart from the ordinary. They were not thought of as animated by some resident and controlling-but separable -soul or spirit. They were in and of themselves, kami. This should be noted as a recognition of the existence in remote Japanese attitudes and feelings toward nature, of a form of primitive psychology to which R. R. Marett and others who have followed him have applied the terin " animatism." In this it is possible to discern the influence of Western research into the classification and development of the god-idea, on Dr. Saeki's studies, although this is probably not the full explanation of the particular form of historical sequence which he adopts. Motoori, who wrote a hundred and fifty years before the time of Marett, had noted the existence of an animatistic or pre-animistic stage in the evolution of the Japanese kami-idea, although he did not give it any particular name. He clearly perceived its existence, however. His words in this con- nection are important enough to be recalled: "There are, again, nume- rous places in which seas and mountains are called kami. This does not have reference to the spirit of the mountain or the sea, but kamni is used here directly of the particular mountain or sea. This is because they were exceedingly awe-inspiring." It is true that Dr. Saeki repudiates Motoori's inclusion in the pre- animistic category of certain particular references of the ManyoshIu to mountains and seas -as kami, on the ground that the latter scholar con- fused poetic adoration with primitive psychology. Yet this does not mean that Saeki finds it necessary to wipe the early Japanese records en- tirely free from pre-animistic traces. He does not cite his references, but evidently on other grounds he finds it necessary to recognize its existence. The matter will come up again later in the discussion. We 28) Shinto Daijiten, Vol. I, pp. 352-353. Toky6, 1937.</page><page sequence="7">38 D. C. Holtom 398 can note here, however, the fact of a recognition on the part of Japanese scholarship of an early stage in the development of the Japanese kami- idea identical with that which has been found by Western scholars to exist in other ethnic areas at appropriate cultural levels. The pre-animistic stage is followed by that of ordinary animism, in which inanimate objects are interpreted in terms of human psychology and separable spirits are believed to reside in and exercise control over the things of the natural world. Dr. Saeki's discussion recognizes that the needs of the economic and social life of the early Japanese people operated as powerful agencies to segregate certain of these spiritual exist- ences and set them apart as the worshipful powers on whom man was dependent for food, clothing and shelter. The author also recognizes a conformity to universal human trends when he points out that involved in this evolution and expressing its highest attainments was an ethical factor. This eliminated the evil and retained the good, which is only another way of saying that the world of the kami was progressively reform- ed under the influence of social patterns. As the human world im- proved, the god-world improved also. The most dominant of these patterns, and the one that has given characteristic form to the gradation of the entire Japanese pantheon, was the political. This powerful influ- ence makes Amaterasu-Omikami the " absolute and supreme administra- tive Kami " who exercises guardianship over the nation and its people and to whom all the other kami are subordinated. Whatever the correct interpretation of the stages of the historical Japanese evolution may be, two great classes of kami emerge, namely, those associated with ancestor worship and those properly referable to an origin in nature worship. Pantheistic influences are also discernible and Dr. Saeki points to this in his brief statement that the Japanese con- ception of kami includes also the belief that spirit exists in all things. This last mentioned phase of development, however, has ultimate origin in Buddhism and not in Shinto itself. However much later Shinto spe- culation may have been modified by Buddhist pantheism, we must in- sist that original Shinto is not pantheistic although some Japanese writers have made it so. They have pronounced it pan-psychism, hylozoism, or pantheism. Such a view hardly squares with the facts, however. Ani- mism, no matter how multiform and inclusive its attribution of spirit animation to the specific objects of the natural world may be, is not pan- theism, although it may easily develop into pantheism. Animism is discrete in its parts and each particular entity is in the control of a well articulated spirit. Pantheism, on the other hand, finds universal unity</page><page sequence="8">399 The Meaning of Kami 39 in a primary reservoir of spirit which flows through all things, which is, indeed, all things. Shinto, in its original and characteristic form, clearly belongs in the former category. The problems arising in connection with the theoretical adjustment of the stream of Shint6 nature worship with that of ancestor worship lie behind Dr. Saeki's three criticisms of Motoori Norinaga. We may direct our attention briefly to the first objection. Taken as it stands, Motoori's statement that the people of the earliest period of Japanese development were all kami and that therefore this was called the Age of the Gods, need hardly be taken seriously. His remarks may find pardon, perhaps, as the over-idealization of the past on the part of an enthusiastic student of the classics and a loyal partisan of Shinto. There is no justi- fication in fact, in so far as the available literary records reflect actual conditions, for saying that the people of the Age of the Gods were all regarded as kami in that age. This not only leaves no ordinary human beings to worship the kamni, as Dr. Saeki perhaps fears, but more than this, it does violence to the overwhelming, if not exclusive, preponderance of nature worship in Old Shinto. If, however, we can understand the question raised by Dr. Saeki to involve the relationship of ancestor worship to nature worship in the ancient Japanese religion, then the issue does become pertinent, and as Dr. Saeki says, presents a problem of unusual difficulty. We will return to this matter in connection with the consider- ation of Dr. Saeki's third criticism of Motoori. The second criticism concerns itself with the declaration that Moto- ori has fostered superstition by his too ready acceptance of certain phases of Buddhist and Chinese zoolatry. It may be noted in favor of Motoori that, even if we admit that Japanese folklore relating to the dragon and the tengu is of continental origin, the case does not seem quite so clear when it comes to the fox. This animal is native to Japan, is deeply ingrained in a widespread and ancient folklore, and its position as the divine mes- senger of the cereal deity, Inari, looks like an original Japanese associa- tion. Even if this animal is eliminated, Motoori's references to the wolf and the tiger still stand, even though these particular animals were not indigenous to Japan. The former is the Okuchi-no-Kami (" Great- mouthed Kami ") of the early literature and the latter is also a fearful kami. All of this is of one piece with the ancient beliefs, to which Motoori refers, which made of the thunder a Naru-Kami (" Sounding Kami ") and which attributed a kami-nature to peaches and necklaces. It is consonant, too, with the beliefs of the pre-animistic and early animistic stages that Dr. Saeki himself admits exist in early Japanese conceptions of kami.</page><page sequence="9">40 D. C. Holtom 400 Under the circumstances it hardly seems legitimate to charge Motoori with fostering superstition. Rather, one would think, Dr. Saeki tends at this point to over-idealize the past. The third criticism raises the problem of the form and extent of nature worship in Old Shinto. Specifically, Dr. Saeki challenges Motoori's interpretation of some of the Manyoshu poems that speak of certain inanimate objects such as mountains and seas as kami. This is poetic metaphore, says Dr. Saeki, and not evidence of a pre-animistic stage of worship as Motoori thought. We will see in the sequel that not all modern Japanese scholars agree with Dr. Saeki in this matter. Meanwhile, we must remember that even though we should find that the evidence supports the theory of metaphorical usage, these cases in the Manyoshui do not by any means dispose of the larger problem of moun- tain and sea worship in historical Shinto. Without pushing the question as to whether or not we can find early evidence for pre-animism in this connection, we may take it as an established fact that mountain worship is a widespread and ancient phase of the indigenous religious life of the Japanese people. The same is true of attitudes towards the sea and of course numerous other phases of nature worship. Dr. Saeki would pro- bably be among the first to admit all this. The real issue lies rather in the relative importance of nature worship as compared with ancestor wor- ship in early Shinto. Dr. Saeki says that as the results of his studies, which are briefly outlined in method but not in content, he finds that ancestral deities were most numerous in the old religion, although nature deities were also revered. It is undoubtedly true that a large majority of contemporary Japanese Shinto scholars would agree with this con- clusion. It is not absolutely unanimous, however, and need not be taken as final. No contemporary Japanese scholar has done more to analyze and ex- pound the various historical stages through which beliefs and practices relating to kami have passed than has Dr. Kato Genchi. The most com- pendious volume that he has as yet produced is devoted to exactly this theme.29) Some of his studies have been made available in different Eu- ropean languages and opportunity to gain a certain amount of acquaintance with his work is open to the Western reader not equipped with a knowledge of the Japanese language. Our discussion here would be deficient, how- ever, if we failed to call attention to his main conclusions in the matter before us. As will be evident on comparison of what is said below with 29) :4F N OF *,ll JV,</page><page sequence="10">401 The Meaning of Kami 41 what has already been passed in review, there are grounds for surmising that Dr. Saeki's general conception of development in content of the idea of kami has been considerably influenced by his reading in the writings of Dr. Kato. Kato's account of the etymological associations of the word, kami, has been noted in its proper place in the preceding chapter and need not be repeated here. The fact that his opinion to the effect that kami literally considered means superior has now been superceded, does not at all affect the value of his studies in the classification, content and historical genesis of the kami-idea in Japanese religion. According to his definition, and considered from the point of view of psychological origin, an object which is regarded as kami, whether man or beast, animal or plant, organic or inorganic, is one that has aroused in the human participant a sense of being in the presence of, or in communion with, something that possesses superior divine nature. In fact, one of Dr. Kato's favorite definitions of religion is just this: " one's consciousness of being in a special re- lationship with the Divine." The all-important question that comes up here is the meaning that shall be given to this " superior divine nature." We will let Dr. Kato answer for himself. In his English edition of A Study of Shinto, the Religion of the Japanese Nation, he says: By " the Divine " I mean any religious object or objects, be they Christian or be they Buddhist or be they of any other religious creed, whether in a lower order of religion or in a higher order of religion in the course of development- the Almighty God of the Christians or the Omniscient Buddha as the God of gods, an ancestral deity or a fetish-god, disembodied spirits or divine totemic animals, a god in theocratic religion or a god in theanthropic religion. If a man comes into relation with such an object of religion, which is greater and stronger than himself, and so far mysterious, unfathomable, incomprehensible, transcending the limit of human knowledge, at least at some moment of time, therefore supe- rior to man in some sense or other, if a religious object so understood is put into relation with a man, just as a son is related with his father, and a friend with a friend, or if a man has faith in such a kind of religious object and he believes that, for instance, his prayers are granted, then we meet a fact or phenomenon, which can be characteristically termed " religious."3'0) Kami, then, in its proper Japanese associations means the divine element of a Shinto-inspired culture, with divine understood in the sense just outlined. While the general significance is as just stated, the spe- cific concepts which it infolds will vary from cultural stage to cultural stage and from age to age. To be understood it must be studied against 30) A Study of Shinto, the Religion of the Japanese Nation, p. 4. Toky6. 1926.</page><page sequence="11">42 D. C. Holtom 402 the background of its historical evolution. This is one of Dr. Kato's special contributions to the study of Japanese religion. Considered in its broad historical sweep there are three main cultural stages in the development of Shinto, and, therefore, in the development or manifestation of the kami-idea, since this is the fundamental concept of Shinto. There is, in the first place, the stage of primitive nature wor- ship or polydemonism; secondly, a stage of higher nature worship or sheer polytheism ; and thirdly, the advanced cultural level wherein beliefs and practices relating to the kami come under the influence of ethical and intellectual elements of a high order. The earliest discernible stage of belief in kami reveals to us a remote beginning in a pre-animistic level, in which conspicuous objects of na- ture, such as fire, wind, sun, moon, rivers, mountains and trees are im- mediately in and of themselves regarded as living, sentient beings. In this sense they are kami. This is not personification and is not a belief in controlling spirits modeled on the idea of the human soul. To take examples: there is at this stage no distinction between fire and a god of fire or between the wind and a god of the wind. The peak of Mount Fuji is itself a great deity (kami) that guards the land. At still an early period of development, this simple naturalism passes into a polvdemonism which rests on a belief in the existence of innumer- able invisible superhuman powers that dwell in and control the visible objects of nature. In this stage the kami-idea has not yet advanced to that of gods and goddesses in the true sense of the word. The kami are rather spirits and more or less clearly personified agencies that animate the manifold objects of nature. To borrow the words of Lang, they are " magnified non-natural men." In this connection Dr. Kato5 studies with an extraordinary wealth of comparative material early Japanese be- liefs connected with the spirits or powers that animated the sun, moon, stars, sky, earth, storm, rain, thunder, lightning, wind, sea, mountains, local land areas, earthquakes, volcanoes, hot-springs, wells and springs, stones, rocks, plants and animals. This is the genuine animistic stage of early Japanese belief in the kami which finds expression in the charac- teristic and extraordinarily complicated nature worship of the Japanese people. In the second stage of its manifestation the inherent polytheistic tendency that was just noted pours forth in a vast array of well articulat- ed gods and goddesses, who are regarded by their worshippers as pos- sessing sex and procreating offspring like human beings, as engaged in man-like occupations and as entering into various reciprocal relations</page><page sequence="12">403 The Meaning of Kami 43 with mankind, even to bargaining like tradesmen for good deals in rewards and offerings. In the third stage of evolution we reach the level of a higher culture religion, wherein tendencies towards universalism both in ethics and philosophy are manifested. The natural and independent development of intelligence and moral perspective in the Japanese people is here supplemented by the positive influence of Buddhism and Confucianism, resulting in the refinement of cruder and more irrational mythological elements into forms that are consonant with higher attainments in know- ledge and in the social and political life. In this process various local guardian spirits and kami of diverse origin are amalgamated into higher concepts, a tendency for lesser kami to be absorbed by greater kami ap- pears, and under the influence of more advanced ethical and philosophical demands, sheer polytheism tends to pass into pantheism. The new ethi- cal demands gave rise-for example-to various symbolical interpretations of the three sacred objects of the royal regalia, which in their earliest usages undoubtedly had magical significance. These ethical inter- pretations of the regalia symbols are many, but to cite one of the most well known formulations, the mirror is made to stand for wisdom, the jewels for benevolence and the sword for courage. Evidence of this evolu- tion to higher levels appears in various other directions. For example, the import of the transition from the old naturism to the enlightenment of a new culture-religion may be guaged by the vastness of the distance that lies between the old naive confidence in the efficacy of phallic rites or of human sacrifice, on the one hand, and, on the other, the sublime ethical insight which is expressed in the declaration of the Shinto Gobu- sho:31) " The gods desire not material gifts, but offerings of uprightness and sincerity. "32) These three cultural levels do not represent hard and fast chronolo- gical divisions. They merge the one into the other and, like the contacts of land and sea along an irregular coast, they interpenetrate each other to deep distances. The old survives in the new, and higher insight is discernible here and there in the old. Even today, remarks Dr. Kato, if one leaves behind him the sophisticated urban areas and pushes into the more simple rural byways, he will find abundant evidence of the survival even into the present of an old nature worship with its accom- 31) 4T,i T.

Not only were exalted per- sonages who possessed extraordinary power and courage, of unwonted skill and intelligence, or majestic mien, regarded as living kami, but there is evidence for the existence of genuine ancestor worship as early as the reigns of Jimmu Tenn6 and Sujin Tenno. Japan, says Dr. Kato, is " a classical land of necrolatry or the worship of the spirits of the dead and of ancestor worship."33) The culmination of the kami-idea in Shinto is attained under the influence of dominant political patterns. Dr. Kato's statements in this respect should be noted carefully: Shinto . . . has culminated in Mikadoism or the worship of the Mikado or Japanese Emperor as a divinity, during his lifetime as well as after his death. . . .Herein lies even at the present day, in my opinion, the essence or life of Shint6, inseparably connected with the national ideals of the Japanese people. Japanese patriotism or loyalty, as you might call it, really is not simple patriotism or mere loyalty as understood in the ordinary sense of the word, that is, in the mere ethical sense of the term. It is more-it is the lofty self-denying enthusias- tic sentiment of the Japanese people towards their august Ruler, believed to be something divine, rendering them capable of offering up anything and everything, all dearest to them, willingly, that is, of their own free will ; of sacrificing not only their wealth or property, but their own life itself, for the sake of their divinely gracious Sovereign, as the example of the late revered general and countess Nogi well illustrated. All this is nothing but the actual manifestation of the religious consciousness of the Japanese people."34) One of the most important publications of research into the realm of the ancient Japanese ideas connected with kami and related terms that has yet appeared is found in the Transactions of the Meii Japan Society in the Spring Number for 1932 under the title, " A Psychological Study of the Development of the Idea of Kami in Ancient Times " (Kami Kannen no Hassei ni Kansuru Kodai Shinri).35) The author is Mr. Harada To- shiaki,36) professor of the Classical Literature Institute connected with the Grand Imperial Shrine of Ise and lecturer on Shinto at the Imperial University of Toky6. His work shows the results of the careful study of recent contributions to our knowledge of primitive religion made by Western scholars and furnishes us with an illuminating analysis of the ba- 33) A Study of Shinto, p. 33. 34) Ibid., pp. 206-207. 35) fr*t, 0&gt;,A?v * iz_ Rt * 6R&gt;E JRM 9 *kMPM itw M--t=,M Btt+t;SaN:W 65-80. 36) I, f1fcJ&amp;M.</page><page sequence="14">405 The Meaning of Kami 45 sic psychological elements that enter into the ancient Japanese concep- tions of kami. He deals entirely with the preanimistic or " animatistic" cultural level-with what Dr. Rudolf Otto calls the numen or the pre-ra- tional sense of " the holy "-and it is here that he finds the most important data for the reconstruction of the original meaning of kami. Harada begins his discussion with the statement: The original meaning of the Japanese term, kami, does not at all carry, in its earliest usage, the significance that it now has of animistic or personal existence. The sea, regarded as an object of awe, was Okitsu Kami (" Kami of the of the offing ") or Watatsumi no kamni (" Ocean-body Kami ").37) What was called Kami no Misaka (" Kami Hill ") did not indicate a surmise of the existence of some divinity that possessed the hill. Also, when the tiger, the wolf and the serpent are regarded as objects of awe, they are immediately and in and of them- selves kami. No matter what may be the truth about the etymological origin of the word kami, it is not a mistake to say that objects that were awesome (osoru beki monto) were called kami or were lauded as kami. What is here designated " to feel awe " (osoru, " to fear," " to feel awe does not indicate the mere natural emotion of being afraid (osore). It is not the kind of fear that we [modern men] feel towards the wolf or the tiger. It is, ra- ther, the feeling of weirdness (monosugoi) and the uncanny (kimi warui) of which ancient man was conscious when in the presence of whatever transcended his comprehension.38) In further elucidation of this primary feeling of " weirdness " or "the uncanny," Harada falls back on Otto's account of the element of awefulness that enters into the composition of the numen, that is, of the pre- rational sense of the Holy. Otto, it will be recalled, in casting about for terminology with which to describe the emotion that he has in mind, says: In my examination of Wundt's Animism, I suggested the term " Scheu" (dread); but the special " numinous " quality (making it " awe " rather than " dread" in the ordinary sense) would then of course have to be denoted by inverted commas. " Religious dread " (or " awe ") would perhaps be a better designation. Its antecedent stage is " daemonic dread " (cf. the horror of Pan) with its queer perversion, a sort of abortive off-shoot, the "dread of ghosts." It first begins to stir irl the feeling of " something uncanny," "errie," or " weird." It is this feeling which, emerging in the mind of primeval man, forms the starting- point for the entire religious development in history. " Daemons " and " gods " alike spring from this root, and all the products of " mythological apperception " or " fantasy " are nothing but different modes in which it has been objectified. And all ostensible explanations of the origin of religion in terms of animism or 37) - jfi,q. This might also be rendered, " Ocean-possessing Kami." Such a meaning for the name, however, would violate the author's thesis. 38) Harada, Op. cit., pp. 65-66.</page><page sequence="15">46 D. C. Holtom 406 magic or folk psychology are doomed from the outset to wander astray and miss the real goal of their inquiry, unless they recognize this fact of our nature- primary, unique, underivable from anything else-to be the basic factor and the basic impulse underlying the entire process of religious evolution.39) It is the special merit and interest of Harada's study that he starts from this fundamental position so lucidly outlined by Otto. The Japa- nese writer says that it is here at this pre-rational or super-rational stage of the sense of the Holy that the examination of the meaning of kami must begin. The word kami, however, is far from standing alone in the ancient Japanese vocabulary as the bearer of this content of mystery and awe. There are various terms that must be studied along with it, and it is, to no small extent, by the study of these related terms that we come to see what kami really meant in its earliest usage. The Japanese language has a special word for the expression of this emotion of " religious awe." It is kashiko, found widely in the ancient classical literature and still in use today. Examples of the usage may be found in the term, Kashiko-Dokoro,40) " The Place of Awe," or " The Holy Place," the name given to the shrine of the sacred mirror of the Imperial Regalia that are handed on from sovereign to sovereign in the Enthronement Ceremonies of the Japanese state. It appears again at the close of many of the norito or ritualistic prayers read before the altars of the Shinto deities-to take a single example out of many possibilities. Here the form is kashikomi kashikomi mo m5su,41) an expression that may be variously translated, but which means: " With awe, with awe it is spoken." When we raise the question as to how the word kashiko, as expressive of this awe or sense of the Holy, was written in the classical literature, we find a rich ideographical usage. In what follows immediately below the account given by Harada is supplemented with a statement of the prin- cipal dictionary meanings of each ideogram, intended to facilitate under- standing on the part of the reader to whom the ideograms themselves are unfamiliar.

All of the forms listed above are of course read kashiko (awesome, holy, etc.) in addition to the readings or meanings here given for purposes of explanation. Kashiko sometimes appears in the adjectival form as kashikoshi or kashikoki, sometimes in the verbal form as kashikomu. Harada studies the frequency of usage in the Manyoshui alone and finds that of all the forms that are there used, the ideogram last cited (f) is by far the most common. It appears fifty-one times as against thirty- two for all other forms combined. In summarizing the meanings of these various usages, Harada says that something more than mere " being afraid " is meant. " Reli- gious awe " and " awesome reverence " are indicated. Furthermore, it should be carefully noted that the objects of this special emotion are not merely the ordinary deities of Old Shinto, the kamigami of the shrines. They include Emperors and other exalted personages; also, natural objects such as mountains, seas, hills and rocks, are sometimes the ob- jects of religious awe. Briefly stated, kashiko designates an emotional attitude of " trembling awe " (oji-osoreru)42) toward these special persons and objects. It is the feeling of the Mysterium Tremendum of Otto. In making further analysis of this emotion, from the point of view of modern psychology, Harada again resorts to a citation from Otto in 42) -L * .</page><page sequence="17">48 D. C. Holtom 408 which the latter author states the probability that in its earliest mani- festations this feeling belongs to the stage of " daemonic dread " (damo- nische Scheu). The related passage from Otto reads: It may well be possible, even probable, that this religious feeling, in the first stage of its development, began with only one of its poles, namely that of a repelling (" niimlich mit dem abdrdngenden "), and so at first took form only as daemonic dread.43) Speaking from the point of view of the content of the Japanese term that is under examination, however, Harada supplements these remarks by saying: The content of kashiko, however, is not merely this aspect of a repelling. It is not merely a fear. In another aspect it takes the form of an attraction and a drawing near because of this awe.44) At this stage of the discussion Harada again refers to Otto's analysis. In order to get the position of the Japanese author before ourselves as clearly as possible we may cite from John W. Harvey's English transla- tion of Das Heilige. The pertinent reference reads: I'he qualitative content of the numinous experience [the experience of the Holy], to which " the mysterious " stands as form, is in one of its aspects the ele- ment of daunting " awefulness " and " majesty," which has already been dealt with in detail; but it is clear that it has at the same time another aspect, in which it shows itself as something uniquely attractive and fascinating. These two qualities, the daunting and the fascinating, now combine in a strange harmony of contrasts, and the resultant dual character of the numinous consciousness, to which the entire religious development bears witness, at any rate from the level of the " daemonic dread " onwards, is at once the strangest and the most noteworthy phenomenon in the whole history of religion. The daemonic-divine object may appear to the mind an object of horror and dread, but at the same time it is something that allures with a potent charm, and the creature who trembles before it, utterly cowed and cast down, has always at the same time the impulse to turn to it, nay even to make it somehow his own. The " mystery " is for him not merely something to be wondered at but something that entrances him; and beside that in it which bewilders and confounds, he feels something that captivates and transports him with a strange ravishment, rising often enough to the pitch of dizzy intoxication; it is the Dionysiac-element in the numen.45) Applying this to the interpretation of the Japanese term kashiko, Harada continues: As is indicated in this statement, the content of kashiko is something more 43) Das Heilige, p. 44. 44) Harada, Op. cit., p. 68. 45) Harvey's Engl. transl. of Das Heilige, p. 31.</page><page sequence="18">409 The Meaning of Kami than the aspect of an awesome driving away (haijo-).46) It has the meaning of a veneration towards objects that are filled with, a fascinating power that attracts the heart, and therefore even a meaning of submission (fukujiu).47) All this leads up to the clarification of the meaning of kami. As the content of the emotion of attraction or fascination of the Holy becomes the object of conscious identification, there appears in connection there- with a value-judgement or a value-feeling, and only as this sense of value operates do we have the emergence of genuine gods or true kami. In this matter, Harada, following Hoffding says: The reason why certain special classes of objects and events were regarded with religious awe by ancient man, that is, felt to be kashikoki, was because, in connection with his feeling of awe towards these objects and events and his be- lief that in them resided either personal spirits or kami, or impersonal essence or power, he discovered, in his relation to the qualities manifested in these objects or events or human beings, a special meaning, that is, a value. These things were to him awesome (kashikoki) and fearsome (osoru beki). This is what Hoff- ding calls the sanctification of value (kachi no seika).48) This sense of value is, however, not ordinary valuation. If we borrow the words of Otto, it is a numen- value, that is, a religious value. Apart from this the idea of a god (kami) does not exist. A kami is nothing other than the concrete expression of this sense of religious value, that is, of something that is kashikoki or awesome. The ancient meaning of the Japanese conception of kami was nothing other than this.49) The rich and varied content of this feeling of religious value is re- vealed in the large number of terms that were used to express it. It is by the study of these that we are able to reach an understanding of the manifold aspects of the Sacred (Kami-teki) and a better apprehension of the nature of the religious feelings that lie at the basis of the genera- tion of the kami-concept. In this connection Harada examines a large number of terms of the classical literature that are saturated with the qualities of sacredness and mystery and which, therefore, throw light on the original meaning of kami. The most important of these terms are noted below and Harada's exposition is summarized and in certain directions supplemented briefly with a small amount of explanatory ma- terial not found in the original text. Itsu50) This term is found widely in the names applied to the deities, sa- 48) 6 49) Harada, op. cit., p. 69. 50) JX, 5fgi, ~f</page><page sequence="19">50 D. C. Holtom 410 cred personages, and sacred objects of Old Shinto. One or two examples may suffice to illustrate the usage: Itsuki-me5i) (" Sacred Female ")-Young maidens who served the kami in the Shinto shrines. Itsu-nusa 2) (" Sacred Offerings ")-Offerings of cloth made to the kami. In the oldest known literary reference, they were made of hemp and paper-mulberry. Itsu-no-wo-habari5`) (" Majestic Point Blade Extended ")-One of the names of the sword with which the Sky Father, Izanagi-no-Mikoto, killed the god of summer heat. Undoubtedly the lightning flash. Itsuki-no-Miya54) (" The Majestic Shrine ")-A name given to the Grand Imperial Shrine of Ise. The above examples merely suggest the wide and varied range of meaning that the word bears when the primitive emotion is phrased in terms of modern categories. It carries the content of " majestic," "so- lemn," " stately," " impressive," " exalted," " powerful," " full of vir- tue," "strong," " valiant," " courageous," " flourishing," " abounding in life ", and " purity " that is accompanied by a sense of taboo. This last named possibility in content appears in usages with the significance of abstinence, caution, menace and severity. In the modern form of Mi-idzu (Mi-itsu)55)-Mi is honorific-it is used to express the sacred virtue or the majestic power of the Emperor. It is this term that the newspapers use when they speak of the success of Japanese arms as being due to the " glorious virtue " of the Emperor. We should note also the forms itsu-kushi, majestic, noble, lofty, lovely and itsu-kushimu, to love. Here, then, in this remarkable word we have an almost perfect ex- ample of that two-fold aspect of the Holy that Otto says is at once the strangest and the most noteworthy phenomena in the whole history of religion. In itsu an element of repelling awefulness stands over against an element of fascinating compulsion. Harada summarizes his study of the term by pointing out in specific detail that it bears this two-fold and apparently opposite content: (1) a majestic awefulness that implies a sense of taboo and self-humiliating restraint, and over against this, (2) a sense of loveliness, compassion and benevolence that imply fasci- 51) 4. 52) : 53) 9(o ,1tjE . 54) *S. 55) O j..</page><page sequence="20">411 The Meaning of Kami 51 nating attraction. Harada hastens to qualify this analysis, however, by pointing out that it is a classification from the point of view of modern psychology. The ancient Japanese did not so analyze and sub-divide their emotions. To them there was no consciousness of oppositeness or inconsistency in what they felt as itsu. What we in the sophisticated modern world call a sense of being daunted. or driven away or of being filled with caution in the presence of the awesome, as over against the sense of being attracted to something that is, at the same time, regarded as benevolent and compassionate, was to the ancient Japanese people a total and undifferentiated concept, as the early usage of itsu shows. To analvze and subdivide this undifferentiated emotion would be to impose upon it the modes of thought of the modern mind. Ikashi5s) The surmise that a relation exists between this term and itsu, just examined, is supported by the fact that they are sometimes written with the same ideogram. Ikashi, like itsu, has a manifold content. Motoori Norinaga says that it means " serious, solemn and awe-inspiring." Harada says that it means majestic, impressive and powerful, and also, important, serious and luxuriant, or full of life. It thus is seen to have a meaning very close to that of itsu. Iku57) The primary meaning of this term is connected with the idea of the possession of life and vital power. It can be translated into English as " animated," or " alive." Harada says that it is clearly related to ikashi (" powerful," " majestic," " noble ") even though it is not absolutely certain that the two terms are one and the same, etymologically speaking. Both words carry the meanings of animated or full of life and power. In the ancient Japanese classics iku is frequently used as a prefix in pro- per nouns to express emotions called forth by reactions to the special qualities of power and greatness attributed to deities and exalted per- sonages. For example, we find names such as Iku-Musubi-no-Kami58) (' Vivifying Creation Deity "), one of the eight deities of the ancient Jingi Kwan or Department of Shinto, or, again, Iku-tsu-Hikone-no- Mikoto59) (" Vivifying Prince-Lord Deity "), one of the gods produced by the Sun Godess in her trial by oath with the Storm God. Both iku and ikashi express aspects of the feeling of awe that was stimulated by 56) Written variously: ), T, X. 57) Z, f'. 58) .,t jIm $. 59) - * 4R , gp.</page><page sequence="21">52 D. C. Holtom 412 experience with objects that were powerful, majestic and full of life. Harada compares with ikashi and iku the term wakanda of the North American Sioux Indians, a designation which embraced in a single cate- gory conceptions which modern man indicates by terms such as: power, holy, ancient, great, animate and undying. Harada introduces numerous other terms for briefer study, but these will have to be omitted from this summary. Their general bearing is already indicated in what has been reviewed above. We may go on to the conclusion. We have noted that the ancient Japanese people em- ployed for the verbal identification of their emotions towards special ob- jects in their environment which were sensed as possessing mystic or mysterious (shimpi teki) qualities, words like itsu, ikashi and iku. Hereby they made articulate their sense of the existence of certain special quali- ties resident in these objects, and in their emotional reactions towards these qualities they experienced the religious feeling that is expressed in the term kashiko-" religious awe." We are here brought into the presence of the content of the divine or sacred or holy in the consciousness of the early Japanese, that is, we are able to see what it was that had the value of kami to them. Objects that possessed the kind of qualities or the char- acteristics that aroused in the breasts of the early Japanese the emotion of religious awe (kashiko) were in and of themselves, just as they were, kami. These kami objects were not first regarded as anthropomorphic beings or as special powers that possessed and manipulated these objects. Prior to the emergence of the conceptions of spirit and soul, and before the ap- pearance of the notions of resident powers and life, the religious emo- tions were directly called into being by contact with certain objects that were in and of themselves mysterious (shimpi teki) to ancient man. Apart from relationship to this earlier stage the notions of spirits and of other divine beings do not arise. Harada closes with another quotation from Otto. In Harvey's translation this reads: What is really characteristic of this stage [i.e., the stage of the earliest level of the manifestation of the religious life in which Harada finds the original mean- ing of kami] is not-as the theory of Animism would have us believe-that men are here concerned with curious entities, called " souls " or " spirits," which hap- pen to be invisible. Representations of spirits and similar conceptions are rather one and all early modes of " rationalizing " a precedent experience, to which they are subsidiary. They are attempts in some way or other, it little matters how, to guess the riddle it propounds, and their effect is at the same time always to weaken and deaden the experience itself. They are the source from which</page><page sequence="22">413 The Meaning of Kami 53 springs, not religion, but the rationalization of religion.60) We have examined enough of the evidence to enable us to come to an important conclusion. On the basis of what we have just seen we can state that kami in its characteristic content is a religious term through and through. It is not what some would have us believe it is, a " secular " expression or one that connotes a non-religious or an extra- religious background and meaning. Those who come to such a conclu- sion must do so either out of ignorance of the facts or because of the in- trusion of circumstances that lie outside of strictly objective study and which necessitate a more or less consciously applied accommodation. If we accept the guidance of the Japanese experts whom we have been following-and everything points to the decision that we must-then kami is a word which in origin and development is saturated with the atmosphere of the Divine, the Sacred, and the Holy. It calls forth emotions of awe and mystery, of restraint and dedication, of dependence and obligation, that are characteristically religious. Further, Japanese scholars who have most profoundly explored the depths of this concept have done so with exactly the same kind of critical apparatus-historical and psychological-that has been used by Western scholars in search- ing out the fundamental aspects of the religious life elsewhere. This is not to say that kami does not have a unique content. From what we have already passed in review we know that it does. It has preserved in a remarkable manner through a long history a characteristic Japanese pat- tern. But we know too that the primary emotions which the term kami registers are not exclusively Japanese, but rather they are attributes of universal human nature. 60) The Idea of the Holy, p. 27 ; Das Heilige, p. 33.</page></plain_text>
