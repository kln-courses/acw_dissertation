<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Aegean Civilization. By Gustave Glotz. New York: Alfred A. Knopf (1925). Pp. xvi + 422. $5.00. The book called The Aegean Civilization is a trans- lation of a French volume published in I923 in the series of works entitled L'Evolution de l'Humanit6. Mr. Alfred A. Knopf, with his usual enlightened inter- pretation of a publisher's opportunities, has included some of the books of the French set in a series which he is issuing under the title of The History of Civilization, under the editorship of C. K. Ogden. The translation, which is made by M. R. Dobie and E. M. Riley, is an excellent rendering of the original, with the occasional appearance of unusual, but good, English words that have been taken over from the French. It is also accurate, even to the inclusion of some errors that occur in the original. Although the book was first published in 1923, the present translation includes corrections and additions made in 1924 to the French work, and a final ad- ditional note written in I925. For the sake of English readers a brief account will be given of the scope and the value of the work. The work is, in fact, an encyclopedic study covering every phase of the Aegean civilization. The subject is discussed with wisdom and sanity. Facts, rather than opinions, are presented; throughout there is evidence of extraordinary knowledge of available material. Where controversial views can not be avoided, they are mentioned, but are not emphasized. After an Introduction that gives an historical survey of the Aegean basin, its climate, its products, and its people, there is a statement concerning the excavations and concerning the resultant chronology of successive periods of occupation, as determined by Sir Arthur Evans and other workers in Crete, and by the scholars who have studied the related civilization of the Greek mainland. The subject is treated in four books. The first deals with material life, which includes the physical type, dress and adornment, arms and armor, the house and the palace. The second book, entitled Social Life, discusses the social system and the government, agriculture, industry, trade, and international re- lations. Religious life, the subject presented in the third book, covers fetishism, anthropomorphic divini- ties, places of worship, religious ceremonies, the cult of the dead, and games. Finally, Book Four treats of the artistic and intellectual life, with chapters on art, on writing and language. This statement of the contents is sufficient to indi- cate the wide range of information that is here tra- versed. But the presentation of the material is always in a readable form and in a pleasant style. A selected Bibliography is appended, and adequate references to sources of statements are given for the use of scholars. But the book is admirably suited to the requirements of the average intelligent reader. Minor criticisms have no place in a review of a book that presents in well balanced form such a vast amount of knowledge, but a word of warning should be raised against the tendency, common among Cretan special- ists, to attribute too many origins to Crete. On page I84 the student is invited to seek "in the work- shops of the Aegean" the origin of any object of the second millennium that "marks an advance" ,whether it be found "in the Mediterranean countries or in the depths of the European continent on the banks of the Rhine or the Danube". Further, we are told on page 235 that Zeus Labrandeus got his name "from across the sea", and labrys is listed on page 387 as a Cretan word, although Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae 45, specifically states that it is Lydian. The chapter on writing and language recalls the fact that, in spite of the passage of many years, the Cretan written</page><page sequence="2">202 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY [VOL.

Some day, when the linguistic key is discovered, more important information about these interesting peoples will be revealed. Four Plates and eighty-seven Illus- trations in the text add to the attractiveness of a well printed, well written book. PRINCETON UNIVERSITY T. LESLIE SHEAR</page></plain_text>
