<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY The Balfour Lectures on Realism. By A. SETH PRINGLE-PATTISON, LL.D., D.C.L., F.B.A. (Edited, with a Memoir of the Author, by G. F. BARBOUR, D.Phil.) (Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1933. Pp. x + 258. Price 7s. 6d.) All who knew Professor Pringle-Pattison, and many glad now to know something of this most distinguished Scottish philosopher, will be grateful to Dr. Barbour for the painstaking and restrained Memoir which occupies nearly two-thirds of the present volume. The rapid rise of Andrew Seth to the premier chair of Logic and Metaphysics in Scotland is seen by the reader to have been predestined: no other fate could have befallen this pre-eminent student of Campbell Fraser. But it was a strange turn of destiny which-in middle life-made the grave scholar Laird of a broad and beautiful domain in the Borders, and gave him the name by which he is known to our generation, but which baffled a public already familiar with several volumes written by Seth. The Memoir, it is sufficient to say, adequately reflects the dignity, generosity, and quiet good humour with which Pringle-Pattison lived and worked in his dual station. Concerning his development as philosopher a paragraph may be permitted here. His early studies allied him with the then gathering school of Anglo- Hegelians. A reaction from the narrow associationist orthodoxy of the time was inevitable; but from the first he adhered to the extreme right-wing of the new party, criticizing alike the pseudo-philosophy of Bain, the subjectivism of the German neo-Kantians, and the materialism of the Hegelian left. His own deep-grained realism, inherited from generations of Scottish philosophy, moved him to welcome Hegel's repudiation of the noumenon on behalf of the intrinsic validity of knowledge. But he soon rejected-if he ever consciously adopted-Hegel's mode of assuring this validity by identifying knowing and being. Thus in the first series of Balfour Lectures (Scottish Philosophy, I885), and steadily thereafter, he insisted upon the necessity of a realist epistemology to the exposition of which this third series (now published for the first time in book form) is devoted. In the intermediate course (Hegelianism and Personality, I887) he so sharply attacked the "Master" and brought into such high relief positions antithetic to Hegelianism-notably his emphasis upon the integrity of persons in respect of one another and the all-enveloping Absolute-that, in my belief, he could never thereafter be deemed an Hegelian. Dr. Barbour appears to suggest a considerable subsequent return upon earlier positions, and a larger measure of substantial agreement with the school, but-if I am not mistaken-he under-estimates the cleavage between the two doctrines; and it is certain that Pringle-Pattison never abated his main differences with Hegel. The "qualification" he offers in The Idea of God (I917) of the notorious phrase, "impervious in a fashion of which the impenetrability of matter is a faint analogue," is rather a concession to further knowledge of the nature of matter than a diminution of his position with respect to finite persons. To this the well-known controversy with Dr. Bosanquet (who repre- sents, I suggest, the most moderate Hegelian position) bears witness. To the end he insisted that, while personality is measurable by the kind and degree of its interconnections with other persons, these interconnections constitute the conditions of a personal entity and not its cancellation. He did, however, withdraw his semi-deist view of the relation of these persons and their Maker; and from this extreme he tended farther toward a pure immanentism than would appear fully compatible with his own ethically formed philosophy. He therefore expressed himself strongly against all notions of the transcendence and creativity of God. These lectures, e.g., close with the characteristic phrase, "There is no region outside of God into which he could 222</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS extrude his creatures, and cut it adrift from himself." But (it may be asked) does not this type of denial follow a lapse in Pringle-Pattison's ideal anthro- pomorphism toward conceptions more appropriate of spatio-material than of the personal entities by which he purports to account for the world? This feature is, perhaps, an idiosyncrasy rather than an integral element of his position. And-on the other side-those who hold that immanentism is inadequate, and that creaturely dependence is something real, must do so with full awareness of the abysmally mysterious character of the relation between the Creator and the creature, which, nevertheless, they feel compelled to postulate. In the four Lectures on Realism Pringle-Pattison justifies the prepossession of contemporary philosophers with epistemology, expressing the conviction that without clearness in this field "we can hardly expect to make satisfactory progress in philosophy" (p. I82). His chief contention is that once epistemology and metaphysics are clearly distinguished it is manifest that in the former realism is alone tenable (or even statable). "Idealism," he observes, "exists only as a criticism of Realism. When developed itself as a substantive theory, it leads to a view of existence which is a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine in question. . . . Realism is left in possession of the field, and a critical or carefully guarded Realism is established as the only satisfactory, indeed the only sane, theory of knowledge" (p. 192). Hegelianism he describes as an "hypothetical divine epistemology" masquerading as a "metaphysics of existence." "But," he adds, "if Hegel swamps Epistemology in Metaphysics, the Realism of Scottish philosophy often errs in an opposite direction" (p. 181). The defect of the school of Reid is that it takes the duality of knower and known for the basis of an irreconcilable metaphysical dualism. Such a "meta- physical dualism would cleave the universe in two, leaving two absolutely non-communicating worlds. But the possibility of knowledge "becomes, on the other hand, the surest guarantee of metaphysical monism-of a unity which underlies all differences" (p. 256). And further, "Epistemological investigation . . . must tacitly presuppose this metaphysical unity of the subjective and the objective, or, to put it more strictly, the harmony of the subjective function with the universe from which it springs" (p. 258). On this view, then, knowledge is seen to presuppose a transubjectivity which is the basis of an epistemological dualism, but which points also (unless we are content with a total scepticism) to a metaphysical monism. Professor Pringle-Pattison, however, derives his metaphysical idealism not from this indeterminate harmony between the knower and the known, but from a wider "ideal anthropomorphism" which lies at the root of all-in the widest sense-idealist theories. His metaphysic is not developed in these lectures which conclude with the opinion quoted above; but it is present in outline in the preceding series, and its general tone may be gathered from the observation (p. I93), "If we take away from Idealism personality, and the ideals that belong to personality, it ceases to be Idealism...." This observation may throw a little light upon the somewhat obscure controversy now con- ducted in an American contemporary as to the nature of idealism. In view of the confusion raised about this term it may well be time it was dropped, but that the type of philosophy it imperfectly designates is perennial cannot for one moment be doubted. Professor Pringle-Pattison would be the last to suggest that theories of universal nature so founded afford certainty (for he enjoyed a full measure of Scottish caution), but he could point out that in this they are at one with every alternative, and that on this level the decision can only go with what proves most congenial in the long run to the generality of cultivated and critical minds. 223</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY In the closing pages of the Memoir Dr. Barbour prints a letter to Pringle- Pattison from F. H. Bradley. It records a surprising agreement with the essentials of The Idea of Immortality (the Edinburgh Gifford Lectures, I922), and contains the remark that, "The mood in which my book" (Appearance and Reality) "was conceived and executed was, in fact, to some extent a passing one.... I cannot alter the book now, though I would not repeat all of it. And in particular I certainly would not say now that 'a future life must be taken as decidedly improbable.' " We are deeply indebted to Dr. Barbour for what has evidently been a labour of love. RALPH E. STEDMAN. The Emergence of Novelty. By LLOYD MORGAN, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S. (London: Williams and Norgate. 1933. Pp. 207. Price 7s. 6d. net.) Professor Lloyd Morgan has written this volume in response to requests from those who have found difficulties in his already published views. He attempts by his A B C method to show that what is required of him and that what he seeks to do is to give an exact but purely interpretative and in no way metaphysically explanatory account of what happens in terms of the notion of emergence. It is interesting to note the frank recognition of the need of the Aristotelian conception of potentiality and the attempt to define it in accordance with the requirements of modern empirical science. The main subject of discussion, however, is the idea of emergence in mind. Professor Lloyd Morgan is anxious to maintain that there is such a thing as emergence in mind. He speaks, of course, on the basis of a wide experience as a psychologist; and yet it is here where it is most difficult to follow him. For instance, following James Mill, he argues that "mental space" is emergent in mind. Value is an emergent in a relational field of which mind is a constituent, and thus would seem to be supra-mental; yet it is "possessed by mind" and also characterizes the object or objects which are the other constituents of the relational field. There are several reasons why one feels difficulty with this view. There is an obscurity in the term mind; the difference between Professor Lloyd Morgan and Professor Alexander is largely due to a disagreement as to what is mental and what is non-mental. There is an obscurity in the phrase emer- gence of mind; it seems at times to come perilously near signifying what mind apprehends or what is meant by the word emergence in the phrase the emer- gence of an idea in the mind. There is a further difficulty, to which these two obscurities no doubt conduce, expressed in the question whether emergence in mind is in any way analogous to emergence in the non-mental, and whether therefore the term emergence is ambiguous. Molecules are supra-atomic; crystals are supra-molecular; but would Professor Lloyd Morgan speak of emergence in atoms ? On analogy, value would have to be spoken of as possess- ing mind. The difficulty arises from the possibility that mind, because of its nature, plays a role which makes it impossible to consider emergence in mind and emergence in the non-mental as being in any way analogous. These difficulties are ultimately of a philosophical nature, and therefore attention must be re-directed to the A B C method. The method may serve to mark the difference between philosophy and science; but Professor Lloyd Morgan intends it to elucidate what he is going to do. He claims to follow a scientific method. The particular points to which he refers, namely Activity, Directive Causality, etc., may give support to his method, even though his 224</page></plain_text>
