<plain_text><page sequence="1">'One Indian and a Negroe, the first thes Hands ever had" Imagining the Archive in Early Bermuda HEATHER MIYANO KOPELSON University of Alabama abstract The early generations of enslaved and bonded Africans and Indians in Bermuda were essential to the functioning of the colony. But beyond their contributions to the colonial enterprise, they continued to practice the skills that connected them to spiritual entities whose power enabled them not only to comprehend their environment but also to affect it directly. In their initial approach to Bermudian shores, in fishing, proc essing manioc, thatching and weaving with parts of the palmetto tree, as well as making cords with cotton and palmetto fibers, they altered the spiritual landscape in ways that are perhaps less tangible to Western schol arly inquiry but no less significant to investigating these individuals' influence on the tiny archipelago in which they found themselves. Uncov ering these multiple layers of meaning requires imagining the archive in an expansive, speculative way that moves beyond certain narratives of the documentary record to a fuller consideration of the process of making place in an early modern Atlantic colony. In August 1616 the English ship Edwin returned to Bermuda after a voyage to the Caribbean. In addition to "plantans, suger canes, figges, pines, and the like," it carried two individuals whose arrival marked an important event in Bermudian history and in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. Disembarked on the twenty-one-square-mile island were "one Indian and a Negroe, the first thes Hands ever had." In having these first non-European inhabitants brought to Bermuda, Governor Daniel Tucker had acted on the Somers Islands Company directives to send a ship to the Bahamas to trade for "sundrye things ... for the Plantación, as Cattle Cassadoe Sugar Canes, negroes to dive for pearles, and what other plants are there to be had."

It began the multicontinental habitation of an Atlantic island: Bermuda was one of the few places Europeans settled that did not have an indigenous population. The instructions from the colony's proprie tary company to seek out an enslaved African and an Indian showed English eagerness to learn from Iberian colonization techniques, as the divers' arrival was made possible by sixteenth-century English privateering raids on Span ish and Portuguese ships and colonies. The disembarkation of the two men marked the earliest introduction of enslaved labor to an English colony in the Americas, three years before the Sâo Joâo Bautista landed "20 and odd. negroes" in Virginia in August 1619.2 The presence of these two men in Bermuda was notable, but as is so often the case in the documentary record of the slave trade, the inked words preserved only their occupation and racial descriptors. They and the other Africans and indigenous peoples of the Caribbean who soon joined them had names, past experiences, and an outlook on the future, but the spare mention of "one Indian and a Negroe, the first thes Hands ever had" or one early colonist's notation of cargo including "a good store of neggars" made no allowance for anything more than their relation to the development of 1.

They continued to practice the skills that connected them to other-than-human persons, the numinous entities whose power enabled them not only to com prehend their environment but also to affect it directly.s In their initial approach to Bermudian shores, in fishing, processing manioc, thatching and weaving with parts of the palmetto tree, as well as making cords with cotton and palmetto fibers, they altered the spiritual landscape in ways that are perhaps less tangible to Western scholarly inquiry but no less significant to investigating these individuals' influence on the tiny archipelago in which they found themselves. This approach does not reinforce the stereotype of non-European peoples as communing peacefully with nature at all times, but rather acknowledges that there was little theoretical divide between body and spirit and pinpoints some material practices through which Afri cans and Indians accessed the other-than-human persons that populated their early Bermuda.

Although each conceived of that world in different ways, it was one that left impressions on their senses and bodies and that was inextricably intertwined with human action and society.6 The bare approximations of numbers tell us that by 1620, when twenty nine shipmates of the "20 and odd. Negroes" landed in Virginia were brought to Bermuda, between fifty and one hundred Africans and Indians had already joined the two pearl divers, who probably came from Margarita Island, off the coast of present-day Venezuela. These early arrivals included significant if unknown numbers of women as well as men, and—as was not the case in many other locations where Europeans created a larger popula tion of slaves through increasing imports of people—births outnumbered deaths among enslaved Africans and Indians in Bermuda from the begin ning. Indeed, natural reproduction was also the primary cause of growth in the English population; the island-born across all racial categories probably became a majority of the population as early as the mid-seventeenth cen tury.7 Although initial generations of Africans and Indians were bound to thirty-year indenture terms that in the more healthful environment of Ber muda did not necessarily mean enslavement for life, the English decisively shifted toward institutionalizing racial hierarchy and practicing slavery as a heritable condition by the end of the 1630s.8 Slaveholding was widespread 6. The scholarship on particular cultures' framing of the relationship between these worlds is vast and includes intense debate on the appropriate methodology for making cross-cultural comparisons.

By 1676 Gover nor John Heydon forbade any further importation of "Negroes, Indians, and Malattoes," as he was concerned that there was not enough work for the bonded laborers already on the island. In 1687 the governor reported 1,737 "negroes" in Bermuda, a number that represented one-third of the total population.10 heritable from the mother is visible as early as 1630, when they parceled out the ownership of children whose parents were claimed by different masters; Jarvis, In the Eye of All Trade, 483n34, and Lefroy, Memorials, 1:505. 9. It is difficult to calculate exact statistics for the distribution of Africans and Indians in Bermudian households in the colony's first couple of decades. The Som ers Islands Company owned most of the slaves in Bermuda, who lived and worked mostly in the households of company tenants but were also sometimes set up in their own households; Jarvis, In the Eye of All Trade, 27, 31, and " 'In the Eye of All Trade,"' 157, 158nl02. At the end of the seventeenth century even the poorest households were more likely to own a slave than not (64 percent of estates from 1690 to 1716 valued at one to forty-nine pounds included at least one slave); the percentage of slave ownership increased as the overall economic value of the estate increased; see Jarvis, In the Eye of All Trade, table 7, 268. See also Bernhard, Slaves and Slaveholders in Bermuda, 115.

For population numbers, see Robinson to Blathwayt, June 6, 1687, 4:59. Four years later the governor reported the population to be 6,248, and people of color still constituted 30 percent; see "In answer to a clause in the Governor's Instructions concerning the Number of the Inhabitants of these Islands," May 5, 1691, The National Archives of the United Kingdom (hereafter TNA): Public Record Office (hereafter PRO): CO 37/25, f. 93. Bermuda's demographics were unusual among English colonies that had significant numbers of slaves. In 1680 slaves in Barbados made up 80 percent of the population.

Untangling these multiple layers of meaning requires imagining the archive in an expansive way and leads us to other kinds of sources and evi dence: archaeological reports, ethnographic descriptions of religious prac tices, and origin stories, among others. It also necessitates leaving the bits of rock and soil that protruded from the Atlantic 648 miles (563 nautical miles) from the nearest landmass of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and reversing the involuntary journeys to their beginnings in Africa and the Caribbean. It is there in Central and West Africa and in the indigenous Caribbean that we will find the clues to piece together the tales of lives, homes, and communities lost and put back together again, only to be pulled apart once more by the calculations inscribed in the flesh of human property devoured by the slave trade.11 Though all historical narratives, regardless of their subject of focus, con tain an element of imagination, the speculative nature of this particular venture is more explicit than for most. In addition to the lack of Somers Island Company records, many personal papers from the period, and any thing akin to the rich social, cultural, and biographical detail recorded in the Inquisition trials held by the Roman Catholic Church, the vagaries of slave trade routes and island demography blur any attempt at a finely grained analysis of the spiritual lives of Africans and Indians that points to exact cultural transfers from elsewhere to Bermuda. Even without being able to recognize the outlines of many specific African or indigenous Carib bean practices, as scholars have been able to do for other parts of the Atlan tic world, it is imperative to consider the few that are clearly visible and to suggest those that might have been.12 Sketching out some aspects of the and Gender in New World Slavery (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 69-143; Michael A.

This reconfiguration permits a fuller recounting of the lives of the enslaved in early Bermuda beyond their appearance on a list of "sundrye things," mere chattel in European maneu verings in the Atlantic world, and connects their productive and reproduc tive work to those around them and those they left behind.13 Their actions, performances, and memories carved, shaped, and named rock, soil, and sea into a many-peopled place rather than leaving Bermuda as a mere waysta tion or likely wrecking ground on the way to some more important destina tion elsewhere in the Atlantic. "DIVERS SMALL BROKEN ISLANDS ... IN FORME NOT MUCH UNLIKE A REAPER'S SICKLE" There is no way to know what the two unnamed pearl divers carried on the Edwin thought as they first saw Bermuda, if they overheard and understood the specifics of the crew's concern about the treacherous course over shallow reefs that in some places extended more than ten miles from shore, or if they merely picked up on a generalized tension. But it is still essential to attempt to look over their shoulders.14 The captain may have permitted Intellectual History of the Atlantic World (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2011), 4-5; see also James Sweet, "Mistaken Identities?

The reefs are the barely submerged plateau formed on top of five sea voléa nos, last active 100 million years ago, and even in places where the leading edge of the reef system runs closer than ten miles to shore, a ship could travel from deep water to wrecking on shallow breakers in five minutes; Jarvis, " 'In the Eye of All Trade,'" 5-8.

That glimpse would not have come until quite late in the ship's approach because the low-lying islands were notoriously difficult to sight from the water.15 The journey to Bermuda was probably only the latest in a series of dislo cations for the two men. Whether the man labeled "Indian" in the English colony's records was from a collection of peoples in the Greater Antilles whom scholars have named Taino, from the Lesser Antilles and an Arawak speaker dubbed an "Island Carib," one of the Guaqueri who were indige nous to Margarita's companion island, Cubagua, from the mainland Carib bean coast, or perhaps even a Pancaruru from the sertôes or the "inland wilderness frontiers" of Brazil, he came from a community devastated by the consequences of European arrival in the Americas more generally and Spanish demand for labor and material riches specifically.16 After establish 15.

The mandated transition was never completed, and Indians continued to endure harsh treatment in the fisheries, as well as to dive on their own account. By the end of the sixteenth century the vast majority of Africans being brought into the Spanish Americas had come from Angola. Most of them disem barked in Vera Cruz or Cartagena before being sold to traders and owners in Margarita and elsewhere. Those who came from coastal regions may have already been skilled in diving for oysters, whereas those from inland regions would have learned the hazardous work after being brought to the fisheries.19 Or the men may have been born in the place from which they were sold to the captain of the Edwin. Free and unfree individuals from Iberia, from other parts of the Caribbean, from mainland Central and South America, and from Africa all interacted in pearl fishing settlements like the ones on Margarita Island, and there is some indication that Spanish officials did not perceive African divers to be of recent import from Africa.20 If they had fled their enslavement in a fishery, either with or without the large canoe in which they worked, they might have been living away from European set tlement along the coastline of Spanish colonies or on otherwise uninhabited small islands.21 Regardless of their birthplaces, they would have entered a world and a community forced to recover continually from the empty spaces caused by high mortality rates and the drive for profit in human flesh.

More than the origin point of human society, this beast shaped political organization and relationships in the human present even as its back was the land that sup ported their dwellings. The island was split into eight cacicazgos, or domains, that corresponded to eight key body parts of the beast: two eyes, a mouth, two forelegs, two hind legs, and the genitals. The power of the cacicazgos was based on their corporeal location on the astronomically ori ented beast. Its head was in the east, where the world begins with sunrise— the southeast part of Hispaniola was Caizcimú, cimû meaning "front, forehead, first" in Taino—which made the southern cacicazgos equivalent to the right hand and so senior to those in the north.24 Even though those political units had collapsed in the wake of Spanish colonization in the sixteenth century, that kind of body knowledge could have passed on from one generation to another, if only as spirit memories, tingling remem brances of limbs no longer present. It signaled the links between the living earth and human bodies, and between the beast body and political body.

This charged relationship to water would have come not only through his work as a pearl diver, but also from his people's understanding of the world around him. There were many different peoples and religious practices in Central Africa, but they shared a knowledge of water as cosmologically significant: not only was it one of the three primary domains, along with earth and sky, but it also separated the land of the living from the land of the dead. Before crossing a river in Central Africa, people would take up white clay from its bottom and smear it on their faces to repel any evil that might approach them in such a powerful place.28 If he was one of the minor ity of the enslaved in Spanish America who was from the Bight of Benin in Slave Trade, c. 1490s-1850s," in Linda Heywood, éd., Central Africans and Cultural Transformations in the American Diaspora (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 46-47. Maxwell, "Race and Servitude in Bermuda," 50, presumes Spanish speaking and "probably Roman Catholic" slaves in the earliest years, an idea elabo rated by Jarvis, who characterized these early slaves as "more accurately termed 'Atlantic creóles' than Africans," distanced from their African origins by their travel experiences and familiarity with European cultures; Jarvis, "Maritime Masters and Seafaring Slaves," 588-90, following Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998), 17-92.

Greg O'Malley, "Beyond the Middle Passage: Slave Migration from the Caribbean to North America, 1619-1807," WMQ 66, no. 1 (2009): 125-72, argues that most slaves sold from the Caribbean in the intercolo nial slave trade were recent arrivals from Africa who spent very little time in the islands. Individuals who had already survived initial rounds of disease and were familiar with the labor regime imposed on them would have commanded much higher prices, if their masters would even have been willing to sell them. Those few who were not recent arrivals had probably been rebellious or undesirable in some other way. Although O'Malley's research concentrates on the eighteenth century, similar logic would have applied in the seventeenth century (136nl6). O'Malley's argument strongly suggests that a significant number of the Africans in early Ber muda had more immediate links with Africa than Jarvis or Maxwell allow.

The cross formed by one of the ship's masts and the yard might have made him think about the original act, the division of the universe into the two worlds of the dead and the living.29 Having spent at least some time in the Caribbean, the man would not have thought of a passage across water as a definitive journey to the land of the dead, as some Africans initially feared when they were loaded onto oceangoing ships. Even if originally from an inland people, he had been enslaved at least long enough to acquire diving skills and perhaps for his entire life, so he would have known that this latest saltwater passage meant the death of his most recent life and a birth into something new, something unknown. And he would have known, intimately, that though Europeans did not literally chew and swallow the flesh of the Africans they bought and sold, they did indeed consume their captives through the trade that exchanged enslaved bodies for money as well as a wide range of commodi ties.30 With his familiarity with coastal waters and his ability to evade the marine dangers that plagued pearl divers, he could have been a healer whose powers to keep other divers safe had been made known by his spirit-guided discovery of a strikingly shaped shell. He could thus be looking forward to finding and collecting stones, plants, or shells to make powerful medicine for this new location. Or he may not have been skilled in ritual practices and have wondered who would help him cajole the appropriate water beings now.31 If he saw the shores of Bermuda before being disembarked, perhaps he wondered what his dwelling space on land was to be, and if he would be able to medicate it correctly with minkisi, power objects that conveyed access to a particular spirit. Or he might have scanned what he could see of the coastline to get a first sense of the local forces that inhabited particular spaces, of what other-than-human persons he was about to encounter and need to invoke for assistance.32 Once established in Bermuda, the pearl divers quickly discovered that the 29.

Labor was at a premium in the young colony, and, rather than allow them to stay idle, the governor probably reassigned the men to planting sugar cane and tobacco. This land-based work was perhaps dangerous in more predictable ways than pearl diving—rollers that pressed cane stalks, boiling coppers of cane juice, or sharp-edged weeds among tobacco plants were not as agile as marine predators—but required their own sets of demanding skills.33 Some of the earliest people of color in Bermuda were familiar with the many tasks required for the successful planting, harvesting, and curing of tobacco, given that it had been cultivated for nearly a century not only in much of the Spanish Americas, but also in Angola and other parts of West Central Africa. A man named Francisco certainly was well versed in tobacco pro duction, as the planter Robert Rich valued his "judgement in the cureing of tobackoe" highly enough to pay the extraordinarily large sum of one hun dred pounds to obtain his service.34 To the two divers, however, this work would have been unfamiliar.35 Although the reefs were barren of pearls, the men did have some occasion to exercise their diving abilities when shipwrecks created other kinds of riches for them to retrieve. In 1621 the divers provided essential knowledge when Governor Nathaniel Butler directed them to recover cargo after the San Antonio ran aground on Bermuda's treacherous reefs. Although some of the wreck lay above the water line, the most prized cargo of "Silver barrs and chest of Rialls" was not so easily located by people in the small boats that retrieved other goods. Since Butler assumed the treasure "must needs lye thereabouts, unlesse some great Rock fish have conveyed them away," he would have needed the divers' assistance in searching for it.36 The Jesuit 33.

The men themselves, not only their knowledge, were necessary for a successful operation. "MAKE THEIR PRESENT REPAYRE UNTO THE CRAULE POINT" One of the most easily observable contributions of the other people of color who joined the pearl divers in Bermuda can still be seen in the indentations called "crawls" that punctuate its coastlines and remain in its place names, but this physical imprint and inherited nomenclature carried parallel influ ences in the world of the unseen. Crawls were natural or human-made ponds set up to hold previously caught fish, which, by the eighteenth cen tury, existed in locations a fair distance inland. Bermudians still refer to Crawl Point and Crawl Hill, among others. Indians and Africans intro duced this technique of maintaining a readily available supply of fish with out having to salt it on a daily basis. By 1623 in Bermuda the practice was established enough that salt pans were built near the crawl for which "Craule Point" was named to facilitate the preservation and stockpiling of fish "in this tyme of scarcitye."38 The indigenous peoples of the Caribbean built corrals with varied materials, including branches and cane stalks. Some functioned more as weirs to trap fish as they swam in or as the tide went out, whereas others kept alive fish caught through other means, such as cast nets.39 The word crawl itself has West African roots, via the sixteenth century Dutch approximation kraal.40 The presence and actions of Indians and Africans fishing from Bermuda 37.

Fishing went beyond feeding the physical body. In the Tainoan cultures, it had associations with the origins of the universe and was as much about maintaining the spiritual vitality of the community as it was about satisfying fleshly hunger.41 Fishing was thus an occasion to inter act with the forces of the water, of the weather, and in the fish themselves through rituals designed to coax those other-than-humans and ancestors into providing abundance. Fish motifs figured prominently on stone collars worn by Tainoan caciques during ritual performances of their leadership such as areito dances and feasts. Lucayans made effigy vessels in the shape of the poisonous porcupinefish, denoting their interest in the fish as more than just food to feed the physical body. One such vessel was recovered in a location where the main activity was to make ritually significant beads from a shell that displayed the highly sought-after quality of brilliance, or guanin, which indicated a concentration of power and energy. This thorny jewelbox shell, Chana sarda, retained its bright scarlet color for centuries, making it particularly valued.42 Small offshore islands, or cays, in the Baha mas were often located in the middle of productive fishing grounds. Nearly every cay in that archipelago contains an archaeological site with evidence of ritual activities. Other Tainoans besides Lucayans also saw places with a rich fish supply as containing spiritual power because of that abundance. Ile à Rat is a cay off western Hispaniola containing the remnants of a small permanent settlement that fulfilled these intertwined activities of providing fish protein and communication with other-than-humans. The high con centration of fish bones in the midden deposit beyond the amount required for the size of the settlement suggests that its inhabitants produced fish for communities farther inland, whereas objects such as a shell tube used to inhale the narcotic cohoba, which indigneous peoples of the Caribbean used to access the supernatural, indicate another way they worked to ensure the health of all.43 Fishing held an important place among coastal peoples in Central and West Africa. In Central Africa ritual fishing expeditions were part of the accession of a new ruler, in part because of the association with water and the connotation of beginnings and rebirth.

Dancing and ritual chants marked this ceremonial meal and harnessed the power inherent in water, directing it in ways to benefit the community. Some Kongo initiation rites also included ritual fishing after the rebirth of the initiates into their new roles. The Italian mathematician Filippo Pigafetta reported the Portuguese explorer Duarte Lopes's descriptions of proscrip tions around types of fish, so that some "Fishes RoyaW were reserved for leaders; any other use led to "very severe and rigorous punishmentes." In Guinea fishermen honored their ancestors by decorating their canoes with spiritually powerful grains and colors of paint.44 Even though Indian and African fishermen in Bermuda were no longer fishing entirely for them selves, perhaps they persisted in approaching the water spirits and others essential to a good catch—more than ever, they were in need of an abun dance of fish, since they were not able to control the disposition of the fruits of their labor. And in the place shaped like a fishhook, hundreds of miles from any other land, the resident forces seem to have been appeased enough to continue to provide the creatures that filled the belly and connected to the beginning of time. "SUNDRYE THINGS . . .

The resulting pulp was pressed in some way, either in a tube basket or through a cloth, to remove as much of the poison ous juice as possible. The paste was then dried, further ground as necessary to break up the larger pieces, and toasted or baked over a fire. The juice was boiled to neutralize the poison and then used as the basis for pepper pot, a dish with chili peppers and other vegetables, as well as animal protein of meat or fish.

Among Tainoans, both men and women cultivated and collected manioc tubers, but women were responsible for processing them.47 Because of its placement in the text, a woodcut from Girolamo Benzoni's 1565 History of the New World probably depicts women making bread from maize, but his accompanying text also details the steps for making bread from manioc. The peeling, grating, extracting and cooking the juice, and baking the dried pulp would have looked quite similar to the steps presented in Benzoni's illustration (figure 3).48 The tuber was an import to Africa, but there, too, women were largely responsible for processing raw plant materials into edi ble food.

For Tainos, the starchy sub stance was food from the gods. Their cultural hero, Deminán, had wrested the life-giving root from the primary god, Yaya, by theft, an action that was a key part of bringing culture to humans. One of the aspects of the spirit of fertility held the title "Yucahuguamá," or "Lord of the Yuca," yuca being the Tainoan word for manioc.50 Island Caribs so identified themselves with this original food that they described themselves as Kalina or Karina, "manioc eaters."51 The tuber carried entirely different meanings of commodification in the context of Africa and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, in which traders used it to victual soldiers and slave ships. Its flour, which was less susceptible to spoilage or infestation than were European grain flours, became a staple of human trafficking in the sixteenth century. For many Native peoples in Portuguese-controlled areas of Brazil in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, manioc became yet another example of the labor their masters extracted from them, rather than being a means of self John Thornton's approach in citing paragraph numbers instead of pages to allow for easier cross-referencing with the Portuguese scholarly edition, Descriçào histórica dos très reinos do Congo, Matamba e Angola, 2 vols., ed. and trans.

They were forced to produce vast amounts of manioc flour for the export trade to Africa. Over the next century, slave traders switched to cultivating the crop in Angola, where they assigned the work to children and the elderly. Manioc became so widespread in the region that by the middle of the seventeenth century, Antonio Cavazzi reported that "nobles and commoners universally use it in diverse ways." Despite the missionary's review of manioc as "optimal sustenance," enslaved Africans made to raise the crop in the Caribbean were reminded daily that others strove to control their bodies, that the slave trade had made the very act of subsistence into</page><page sequence="24">Kopelson • "One Indian and a Negroe, the first thes Ilands ever had" \ 295 a performance of cultural alienation rather than affirmation. Making slaves plant manioc to feed themselves was yet another demand owners placed on top of already onerous labors, especially on sugar plantations.52 By the early 1620s manioc cultivation was so widespread and successful in Bermuda that not only was there some to spare for export, but one of the island's ministers lauded the tuber as an example of the Christian deity's goodness to the English. When the struggling Jamestown settlement in the Chesapeake sent to its sibling colony for food in 1622, Governor Butler offered a substantial "store of the Cassada roote" along with other plants, fowl, and rabbits.53 Lewis Hughes's 1621 A Plaine and True Relatione of God's Goodness towards the Summer Ilands instructed English colonists that "The Casava roote is like to proove a great blessing of God unto you, because it makes as fine white bread as can be made of Wheat, and (as I am perswaded) wholsome; because the Indians that live of it, are tall and strong men."54 Rather than giving credit to Africans' and Indians' vital expertise, Hughes—as did Roger Williams in A Key into the Language of America— subsumed their knowledge and toil under a European supernatural benifi cence. Hughes's appropriation is all the more notable because his recipe for the "fine white bread" detailed all the tasks of preparing manioc for consumption (figure 4). Although Hughes did not mention who would have made the bread, it is likely that English masters would have assigned the arduous task to enslaved Indians and Africans whenever possible. His brisk list of the required steps obscures the labor contribution of people of color, particularly the vital work of women, as shown in figures 2 and 3, tasks and movements that would have defined the rhythms of their days. Indian bod ies were present in Hughes's construction only as object signs and pictures of "tall and strong" animal health, indications of the safety and efficacy of the root as "wholsome" food for the English. Such slippage is typical of many European accounts that ascribed Indian and African knowledge to colonists' own inventiveness, divine benevolence, or both. Richard Ligon often elided the knowledge and skill of enslaved Africans and Indians when he described plantation life on Barbados, writ 52.

The unmarked European "we" accomplished the harvesting and propagation of the manioc tuber: "as we gather [the root], we cut sticks that grow nearest to it, of the same tree, which we put into the ground, and they grow. And as we gather, we plant." Ligon did, however, acknowledge Indian expertise in cooking "this Pone" and in teaching him how to use it to make a piecrust that would not crack.55 Nathaniel Butler's Historye of the Bermudaes extolled the "great abound ance" of introduced plants such as plantains, tobacco, manioc tubers, and watermelon, which "providence and paines have since the plantation offred divers other seedes and plants which the soyle hath greedily embrased and cherished." The "paines" Butler described were Europeans' effort in getting the seeds and plants to the island, where, in his account, the soil did the rest. But in addition to "providence," the soil's embrace of these new plants required knowledgeable human intervention, as shown by the Bermudian planter Robert Rich's search for someone to improve his fields' tobacco yield and his willingness to pay a high sum to obtain an African skilled in such matters. Butler's description of the "naturall productions of the earth" that had existed on Bermuda before colonial settlement, such as an "infinite store of palmitoes," was more subtly obfuscating. The "great variety of symples," including cedars, mulberry trees, olives, and palmettos, was so replete "with divers others of unknowen both name and vertue, wherby (as yet) they become not only namelesse, but lost to many usefull employments, which time and industry noe doubte will one day discover." The predicted "indus try" undoubtedly belonged to the European colonists, although in Butler's text, as in early Bermuda, the only knowledge about those plants came from people unwillingly brought to the island as slaves. To them, Butler's name less plants with unknown usages were known quantities, a relationship that Butler acknowledged. He wrote that of the "divers" plants, "already certaine of them, since the comeinge in of the newe guests, have gotten them appel lations from their apparent effects."56 Butler knew of the contribution made by enslaved Indians and Africans, but his euphemistic reference to them as 55.

The discursive erasure of the bodies and knowledge of non-Europeans made it easier for colonizers to maintain a mental map of a colonized land scape in which success resulted only from "God's goodness" and their own superior skill and intelligence. Like "God's goodness" in Lewis Hughes's description of cassava in Bermuda, Butler's circumlocutory use of "newe guests" to refer to enslaved Africans and Indians did more than obscure the knowledge transfer from Africans and Indians to the English. It removed from English view the coerced nature of the work performed by slaves in Bermuda, as well as framing their bodies as nothing more than empty ves sels that—when filled with cassava bread—proved that the unfamiliar food was a solid foundation for the colonial enterprise. This elision inverted the structure of expertise and confirmed rather than challenged English belief in their own intellectual and cultural superiority, thus supporting the devel opment of a racialized contempt. One English colonist's praise of an African man's skill at curing tobacco, a rare acknowledgment of the desirability of Africans' knowledge, under lines the gender and status components of these formulations rather than undermining their overall strength. When Robert Rich acknowledged Fran cisco's "judgement in the cureing of tobackoe," he did so because he was trying to convince his relatives that a great increase in the amount of mer chantable tobacco would give them substantial returns on the one-hundred pound investment necessary to secure the man's abilities. Indeed, his descriptions of Francisco's skills seem to have been accurate, judging by the following seasons' outputs.57 But neither Rich nor other Anglo-Bermudians made mention of women's skill and labor in turning a poisonous tuber into a staple food. Even as women's work in processing cassava was a daily neces sity in the early years of the colony as well as to the broader development and continuation of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, that essential economic contribution escaped the notice of men like Robert Rich, accustomed as they were to being served by women who had also processed the food.58 57.

"A TREE CALLED THE PALMETO" Indian and African knowledge transformed the intimate spaces of English life on Bermuda. Their knowledge about the complex manipulation of plant fibers to create sleeping surfaces, roofs, vessels, wall decorations, and cloth ing influenced the construction of houses, housewares, and sleeping ar rangements. The forced immigrants were probably responsible for the most widely used roof construction in early Bermuda, a thatch made with leaves from the autochthonous palmetto. The English were familiar with thatch ing, but they tended to use rushes or marsh reeds. Palmetto thatching con tinued to be widespread even once that colony was well established. In 1688 Governor Robert Robinson reported that for 84 percent of households, the palmetto "leafe [was] the only thatch of their houses."59 Palm thatch was common throughout the Caribbean as well as in Central and West Africa. Houses in the Tainoan Caribbean, whether the larger dwellings found on Hispaniola and Cuba or the smaller ones common in Puerto Rico, were thatched with palm leaves. The sixteenth-century Span ish bureaucrat Gonzalez Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés's early accounts of Tainoan life included both rectangular and round palm-thatched houses (figure 5). Unlike many early and quite fantastic images of the Americas that circulated in Europe, these illustrations had some foundation in reality and were based on drawings done by Oviedo himself.60 Pieter van den Household: The World of Alice Le Strange (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), 212-20. 59.

Houses also used mats of woven palm over the framework to serve as walls.62 Nor was the relatively rough work of thatch the only use for palm leaves 1:417-54; Brennan, "Visual Images of America in the Sixteenth Century," 1025-48. 61.

Using finer processing and weaving techniques than necessary for thatching a roof, the newly imported Bermudians taught their English masters to make mats and other cloth, baskets, cords, and hats. Lucayans valued the palm fibers for their shininess, and they made tightly woven baskets of intricate designs. Other Tainoans also wove baskets and mats. In Kongo people used split-vine bas kets for carrying and storing, as well as making baskets, mats, and rope from palm leaves.63 Their tutelage was so successful on Bermuda that in 1688 Governor Robert Robinson stated that the trees were of "soe greate &amp;. Extraordinary use &amp; Service to the people that without them it is Generally opinioned they Could not have Subsisted," since, in addition to using their leaves as roofing material, "they alseo Make Cables [and] Chaires with such like necessarys."64 Weaving with palm leaves was a highly developed art in Central Africa, and European travelers and missionaries compared woven palm-leaf cloth to the finest European-made silks. Filippo Pigafetta praised the "mar velous arte" of "making cloaths of sundry sortes, as Velvets shorne and unshorne, . . . Sattens, Taffata, Damaskes, Sarcenettes and such like" in the eastern provinces and areas adjoining Kongo. Sarcenet was a fine silk, but, unlike that made in Europe, the type made in "this countrey . . . and other places thereabouts" was "not of any silken stuffe" but "of the leaves of Palme trees." Indeed, the finest specimens were too "precious" for any but "the king, and such as it pleaseth him." Cavazzi wrote that the beaten leaves of one type of palm resulted in such fine, soft fibers that the weave of the cloth thus produced brought him to "astonishment."65 To produce such finely woven luxury cloth, the leaves had to be worked to a greater degree than the tying and laying required for thatching. Pigafetta noted that the process started with keeping the palms "under and lowe to the grounde, euery yeare cutting them, and watering them, to the ende they may grow smal and 63.

Once those "tender" leaves were "cleansed &amp;c purged after their manner," techniques that he did not further specify, "they drawe forth their threedes, which are all very fine and dainty, and all of one evennesse, saving that those which are longest, are best esteemed. For of those they weave their greatest peeces."66 European observers, including Cavazzi himself, were not always so laudatory about woven palm. Although Cavazzi had praised the fine nature of some palm cloth, he disdained it as an adequate covering for an infant undergoing Christian baptism. Mocking the social pretensions of couples who added a noble honorific to their infants' names despite their lowly status, Cavazzi's evidence for their "mis erable" condition was that they could never even hope to own a handspan of land and that they had only a "simple and green leaf, instead of linen, to cover" their babies. His reference to a leaf may have been an exaggeration for effect, since a finely woven cloth would have been appropriate for an important ritual.67 African weaving techniques influenced the development of the distinctly Bermudian and quite profitable plat industry, which involved braiding palm leaves into thin strips that could then be sewn together to build hats, bas kets, and other objects. The composite method of combining narrower widths to produce a wider finished piece of cloth or other object, as well as the absence of specialized equipment, was an outgrowth of a centuries-old industry in West and Central Africa. Central African weavers produced the complicated cloth remarked on by European observers on a simple appara tus made from easily procured materials. According to one Italian mission ary to Kongo in the early eighteenth century, weavers did not have a "loom specifically made for the task, but they plant two pieces of wood in the ground, placing the fibers between them" and then used a stick instead of a shuttle to weave the woof of the fabric. When there were dedicated looms, as archaeologists have found across West Africa dating from as early as the thirteenth century, they produced a cloth of relatively narrow width.68 Off the coast of West Africa in the Cape Verde islands, weavers used such looms to make cloth from cotton and sometimes imported silk. To make wider pieces of fabric, weavers sewed together six strips that were each five to six 66. Pigafetta and Lopes, Report of the Kingdome of Congo, 39. 67.

One man holds up woven palm fabric with differently patterned bands, apparently for the inspection of the seated man at the right-hand side of the painting whose headgear indicates that he is a Mbundu individ ual of high status (see figure 6). The elaborate cloth, imported from Kongo, since the Mbundu inhabitants of Matamba did not make palm fabric worked in that fashion, was worn only by elites such as the seated nobleman. It is likely that the highly valued cloth formed part of the payment for a shipment of slaves taken from the interior and that the man holding the cloth was a pombeiro, or factor, of a slave trader on the coast.70 The strips produced through plat making in Bermuda were only one-half to one inch wide, far narrower than the five- to six-inch width common in West and Central Africa, but the process of making a finished object was the same. Initially, Indians and Africans who joined the two pearl divers would have been the ones who were familiar enough with the material to begin producing the strips. Tainoans and other indigenous Caribbean peo ples do not seem to have used the composite technique, but they did use palm fibers to weave baskets as well as cloth, sometimes incorporating lumi nescent feathers of mainland birds acquired through trade. Since weaving was gendered differently among Africans and indigenous Caribbean peo ples, it was probably indigenous Caribbean women and African men who first made plat. Women were the weavers in the Caribbean, both of open weave items like hammocks and nets and of more tightly woven objects like baskets, mats, and clothing.71 In many areas of West and Central Africa, in contrast, weaving was men's work, although women helped prepare the materials for weaving.72 69.

As the first enslaved practitioners taught the English the technique for making rope, hats, mats, and other items, producing plat became work for all women, one that required no special equipment, although some house holds did use wheels to take up the braided strips. Over the second half of</page><page sequence="34">Kopelson • "One Indian and a Negroe, the first thes Hands ever had" | 305 the seventeenth century, plat manufacture became such a significant cottage industry that in 1691 the island's government protected the local supply of the raw materials, forbidding any export of unworked palmetto tops or even brooms and cordage. After hats and bonnets made of plat became a highly desirable fashion accessory in England in the 1720s, the profits of the indus try were five times greater than what the island's maritime activity produced in that time and twice as lucrative as seventeenth-century tobacco exports from Bermuda. Though the activity of plaiting was widespread among all Bermudian women, those who could command the labor of others reaped the most profit. Several Anglo-Bermudian widows, such as Mary Gilbert and Elizabeth Tucker, were among the few dozen plat brokers who domi nated the trade, drawing not only from the work of the women they enslaved but also from that of surrounding households.73 In addition to the skills of weaving with palm leaves, Indians and Afri cans in early Bermuda transmitted their knowledge of weaving and knotting cotton rope into sleeping nets, or hammocks. Indeed, the word hammock comes from the Taino hamaca. Soon after the two divers arrived in 1616, English colonists in Bermuda began to sleep in hammocks instead of on the ground or, for the wealthiest, on a flock mattress laid on a bedstead.74 Throughout the Caribbean the most common sleeping surface was a cotton hammock suspended between the eaves and the central supports. Not only did the early chronicler Oviedo include an image of a hammock in the first published version of his observations on the peoples of the Americas, but the object was important enough to him that he pushed for a more realistic image in subsequent editions of his expanded Historia general, first pub lished in Seville in 1535. Oviedo instructed his printer to use his drawing of an occupied net molding itself around the human figure rather than the woodcut, which showed an empty, apparently stiff rectangle. The size of a house and the number of its inhabitants varied throughout the Greater Antilles, but the practice of sleeping in a hammock was the same. The Portuguese had taken the technology to Africa early in the sixteenth century 73. Jarvis, In the Eye of All Trade, 290-92. In the 1730s the value of plat plum meted because of overharvesting, competition from Bermudians who emigrated to South Carolina and the Bahamas, and changing fashions in London (292-93). 74. Keegan and Carlson, Talking Taino, 13; Jarvis, In the Eye of All Trade, 32. By the late sixteenth century in most areas of England, beds had replaced mats and straw pallets even for nonelites, while the wealthiest households would have had a feather-stuffed mattress to lay over a wool-stuffed, or flock, mattress; Shammas, "The Domestic Environment in Early Modern England and America," 6.</page><page sequence="35">306 I Early American Studies ' Spring 2013 after learning it from indigenous peoples in other parts of the Americas.75 The suspended net allowed air circulation and made it more difficult for animal and insect pests to torment sleeping humans, an arrangement that provided a clear advantage over mats laid on the damp ground and even over a bedstead, since the legs of a bedstead were all too convenient a pathway for unwanted nighttime visitors. In Bermuda the cotton to make the hammocks came either from individual households that grew small amounts for their own use, or from trade with Barbados and other Caribbean colonies.76 "ROPES FOR OTHER USES" The most common material for ropes was not cotton but palmetto fiber. When Governor John Hope arrived in Bermuda and was asked to report on the state of the colony in 1722, he described its economic status as balanced on two trees, the cedar and the palmetto. He wrote, "Of the Cedar they Build their Sloops &amp; Fishing boats; &amp; of the Palmetto leaves, they make a sort of ware call'd Piatt; as likewise Cables for their Sloops, &amp; Ropes for other Uses."77 The beginning of Hope's term as governor coincided with the early stages of the plat boom, and even once the plat market bottomed out a decade later, the other half of his assessment remained accurate. Cedar trees furnished the materials for the Bermudian turn to a maritime economy fueled by buoyant, fast cedar sloops rather than the on-island production of either staple or food crops, a reorientation of the island's economy that occurred after the Crown dissolved the proprietary Somers Island Company and took over the colony in 1684. But the governor's comments applied in more ways than he probably realized. The cordage that enslaved and poor Bermudians made from the palmetto was certainly useful for cables to use in fitting out the sloops that became a mainstay of the island's economy.78 The first generations of practitioners, however, may also have seen some thing beyond the creation of a merchantable product in the thousands of yards of cordage they produced. The product and the work to make it may also have held spiritual meaning, especially in the early years of the colony when the connections with Africa and the Caribbean were more direct and 75.

Ties, cords, and knots held spiritual meaning and function in many of the cultures early slaves brought with them to Bermuda. They were a way to connect the world of the living to the world of the dead and of other than-human persons, and to provide a conduit between those worlds. Ritual and physical functions sometimes overlapped, as they did in making the cord required for many fishing techniques: fishing was ritually significant in addition to its furnishing an important protein source.79 Spinning and tying plant fibers into nets or weaving them into cloths and containers of various kinds were actions that provided for the outer container of the physical body while also having meaning for the inner essence of a person.80 Cords and ropes could tie a boat to a landing and a burden in a basket, but they were also religiously significant in and of themselves: they closed packets of spiri tually charged medicine, adorned ritual clothing, and bound the limbs of religious specialists and their associated power objects. Though few of the Africans brought to Bermuda in the first decades would have had West African links, those who did would have had strong associations, both nega tive and positive, with cords. In vodun, a slave was a "person in cords," while a vodunon or religious specialist might counter such enslavement by a powerful object, or bocio, bound in cords. The object and concept were linked with death because of the practice of tying corpses before burial, as well as the belief that the dead used cords to bind and harm the living. But cords were also connected to the other direction of the passage between life and death, as pregnant women sometimes wore cords around their hips as a protection against miscarriage. A powerful image and object, a cord could also indicate durability, connection, and the vitality of human action.81 Cen 79. Lucayans assigned spiritual meaning to the physical work required to trans form an object from its "plain, dull" form to an intricately worked state that de monstrated highly desired qualities; Berman, "The Aesthetic Brilliance of the Lucayans," 130. 80. The idea of the physical body as a container or outside shell that masked the inner essence of the person was common, although with slightly different inflec tions, in West and Central Africa as well as the Tainoan areas of the Caribbean; see Suzanne Blier, African Vodun: Art, Psychology, and Power (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 204; MacGaffey, African Spirituality, 227-31; Oliver, Caciques and Cerní Idols, 48-52. 81.

Tying up a nkisi bound power to the object and prevented it from escaping, and Kongolese Christians extended this practice of kanga to the Christian pantheon and tied cords around their hands and feet on feast days to demonstrate their status as slaves to Christian spiritual forces.82 Fine cotton cords dyed red or violet suspended the shells or stones in crescent shapes, or caracoli, that Kalinas prized for their powerful reflective qualities and color. The bright ness of the cord complemented that of the pendant, a quality that signified a concentration of energy.83 Tainoans also used cordage in ritually significant objects. One form of chiefly regalia, the elbow stone—so named because it was the abbreviated point that evolved from triangular stone collars—used cordage or sometimes wood to complete the collar. Even in all-stone collars, sculpted cords binding figures suggested the continuing importance of cords and binding in Tainoan religious practices. The bodies of the deceased, especially if the individuals had held high status while alive, were wrapped in hammocks before burial, another example of how cords connected the worlds of the living and of the dead.84 Ligatures held an even more specific ritual function among Tainoan peo ples, as religious specialists, behiques, bound their limbs with cotton cords to close up their bodies and make them better suited to be channels for communication with other-than-humans. Although these details are not common in European textual descriptions, this type of binding can be seen on the arms and legs of a cerní, a ritually powerful anthropomorphic figure. The cord binding served to tie shut the joints, which were access points into the behique's body, and concentrate his spiritual power without inter ference from intrusive substances or beings.85 In the case of a cemi found in a cave near Maniel in Hispaniola, its cotton and possibly palm-fiber body houses the skull of an ancestor. Not only did the cords around the limbs denote the spiritual function of the object—perhaps mimicking the abilities 82.

The cotton and other plant fibers gave the ancestor a "new face," reproducing the Tainoan belief that the apparent body is an outer shell and that persons are composed of parts that can be separated from one another and exchanged. The cordage of the cemi's face thus sat at the threshold between the living and the dead—the spirits of the living, or goeiza, were concentrated in the physical structure of the face because of their ability to display emotion, while the spirits of the dead, opia, resided in the skull bones because the skeletal form could not express emotion. A new face for the ancestor-as-cemi allowed the person, in reconstituted cerní form, more easily to continue to participate in clan relationships.86 It is unlikely that the first Indian pearl diver brought to Bermuda or any of the captives imported after him would have been able to bring with them anything like the cotton cerní found near Maniel. Separation from the ancestors was a less tangible part of the losses created by the trans-Atlantic slave trade and chattel slavery, but its marks would have been deep, even if invisible alongside the scars of physical violence on the bodies of the enslaved. If part of the violence of slavery was being ripped away from countless generations of ancestors, cords could provide some means to access those beings again, even when separated by hundreds and even thou sands of miles in the apparent geography of the early modern map. That collapsing of time and space could happen for vodun practitioners, who were already familiar with taking voduns with them after being uprooted from their natal lands in West Africa, long before being tangled in the trans Atlantic slave trade. But it could also occur for other peoples who did not have as strong a tradition of traveling shrines for ancestors. In Kongo, even though fixed shrines were the place for descendants to approach an ancestor, those were not the only locations that held power. Minkisi were smaller power objects associated with a specific problem and spirit who worked on that problem. They traveled more easily not only because they were often physi cally smaller, but also because they could be made from objects in one's sur roundings.87 Remaking the connections between all the generations who had crossed the threshold into the world of the dead and the currently living generations was not easy, but it was something enslaved individuals learned 86.

HANNAH MANENA, BAPT. 1660, MOTHER PRISCILLA In 1660 Hannah Manena, the infant daughter of a woman named Priscilla, was baptized. The record included the notation "Negro" by Hannah's name, one of a small but not minuscule number of similar entries that have sur vived in the fragments of Bermuda's church registers.88 In just a couple of generations, Bermuda had come to look quite different from the way it had when the pearl divers first arrived. By the time Hannah's baptism occurred, the majority of enslaved people in Bermuda were island-born, linked by dense kinship networks, and lived in households with relatively even racial breakdowns.89 We do not know if Priscilla sought or instead merely acqui esced to Hannah's baptism, but following the traces of Priscilla's familial links suggests some of the meaning the ritual might have had for her. It also offers a sense of possibilities for kinship in a place like Bermuda, as well as the disruptions and discontinuities endemic to enslavement. Priscilla was just one of thirteen children whose names survived the molestations of insects and humidity that have partially obscured a 1632 list of company slaves allotted to the governor for his use. The list grouped those children into nuclear families under each of the six adult couples also mentioned by name.90 Priscilla and her sisters, Susan and Gwendolin, were born to "Manono whose wife is Lucretia," a couple who may well have experienced the trauma of saltwater slavery, the long journey from a natal homeland to a port town in Central Africa, through the holding pens of the slave factories, the ocean voyage, landing in the Caribbean, and another shorter ocean voyage that brought them to the tiny Atlantic island.91 By the mid-1660s Priscilla was in her mid-thirties and had had three chil dren with her master, Lieutenant John Elwick. Hannah was the eldest. When the church record listed the infant's last name as "Manena," it preserved a form of her maternal grandfather's name. In the sixteenth and seventeenth 88. A. C.

If, on the other hand, her family links were to the Bight of Benin, the choice of name might reflect the belief that every infant was a replacement for someone else in the family.93 As much as this name signaled Priscilla's assertion of kinship ties and the existence of generational connections in Bermuda, it is important to remember that it has survived in the paper record only because the minister or clerk who kept the church register permitted the notation of a surname for the baptized infant. For every connection that was thus memorialized in the European archive, there were many more that were not. We do not know whether Priscilla had been baptized. Perhaps her mother, Lucretia, had acquired her own saint's name as part of a Catholic baptism, although some individuals who had avoided baptism nevertheless adopted Portuguese names.94 Lucretia may have told Priscilla about eating salt in Kongo, an action that was at once part of the baptismal ritual admin istered by Catholic missionaries and a means in Central African religions to ward off other-than-humans with evil intent. In the mid-seventeenth century the Capuchin missionary Antonio Cavazzi complained that people in the Kongo believed eating salt to be the transformative element in the initiation ritual because missionaries "believed that it was less improper to accommodate themselves to [the Africans'] lack of refinement, and instead of baptism" to call the ritual "Curia mungua," or "to eat salt."

Like many Central Africans who encountered the Portuguese and their reli gious teachings, she may have regarded baptism and Christianity as another layer of spiritual practice, additional techniques to counter or at least ame liorate the malevolent forces that had resulted in her enslavement.96 The glimpses of Priscilla's life do not stop with the baptism of her oldest daughter. Some time before March 1664/65, she married "one Powle, a Negro servant of Elwicke."97 Powle, or Paul, was purchased by John Elwick from among the fifteen individuals sold as slaves from the Francis and Richard in November 1660. The names of Paul's shipmates suggest a possible association with Africa, as well as showing Iberian and Anglo influences. Paul's fellow captives included Mingo, two men named Antony, Lusea (Lucea), Katalina (Catalina), Pedro, "an Indian," Fran cisco, Maria, and Whan (Juan), as well as Peter, Christopher, Johanna, and Mihill.98 These multiple origins make it likely that just as the Edwin had 95.

Though the Bermuda these captives would have first set foot on was home to a much more established colony than the one that had greeted the Edwins unwilling passengers, they would be just as important in influencing the way of life on the island and in changing the environment—seen and unseen—through their skills, knowledge, and toil. At first glance, all it is possible to know about the first two enslaved people on Bermuda are the labels Europeans applied to them and something of the physical knowledge contained in their lungs, legs, arms, and hands that their new owners hoped to exploit. The pearl divers and the Africans and indige nous peoples of the Caribbean who joined them after 1616 certainly shaped early Bermudian society, as well as the very landscape and contours of the coast. But beyond their contributions to the colonial enterprise, they brought with them other-than-humans who populated their surroundings and made a particular place out of inchoate space. Attention to these less tangible layers of environment permits a deeper—even if necessarily conjectural—sense of the process of defining bodies and making place in an early modern Atlantic colony. Although obscured in the imperial historical record, the propitiations and maintenance of the entities who made themselves known to humans were reproductive practices that in their seemingly ephemeral performance brought whole worlds into being." Enslaved Africans and indigenous Caribbean peo ples worked to transform Bermuda into a place that could be like home, where they gained familiarity with the local other-than-humans who inhabited the world of the dead that was just a threshold away.100 Although their efforts were perhaps unmappable in precise terms, they still began the formation of Bermuda's sacred geography: at once intensely local, rooted to that particular sea- and landscape, and ocean-spanning; grounded in their here-and-now as well as connecting to the ancestors, to the first creation.
