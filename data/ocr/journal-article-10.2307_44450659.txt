On the authority of Albrecht von Haller, we even consider him responsible for the term irritabilitas (irritability),1 which he introduced as a biological concept. " Francis Glisson, who discovered the active force of the elements of our bodies, was the first who invented the word Irritability , which he attributes to a natural perception , that is not accompanied with any sensation, and depends upon Archaeus who is the framer of his own body." 2 In this statement Haller clearly refers to Glisson's Tractatus de ventrículo et intestinis of 1677.8 Here indeed, Glisson used the word irritability to denote a biological property not dependent on consciousness or on the nervous system. Glisson's ideas on 1 1 repeated this erroneous notion in my introduction to the re-edition of the English translation of Haller's A Dissertation on the Sensible and Irritable Parts of Animals, Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1936 (see p. 2). 2 Haller, ibid., p. 42 f. 8 This is made even more obvious in Haller's ensuing analysis of Glisson's notion. In his Bibliotheca anatomica, t. 1, Tiguri : Orell, Gessner, Fuessli, 1774, p. 452, Haller like- wise associates Glisson's contribution to irritability with the Tractatus of 1677 and explicitly states : " ipsum demum nomen excogitavit." 297</page><page sequence="2">298 OWSEI TEMKIN irritability as expressed in the Tractatus have been analyzed and inter- preted so often, that we need not present them here.4 In crediting Glisson with the invention of the word irritabilitas, Haller made a mistake which, as far as I can see, has been shared by medical historians.5 Actually, the word was used by Apuleius in the second century A. D. to denote the emotion of anger which Plato had placed in the heart.6 Moreover, connecting irritability with the late Tractatus de ventrículo of 1677, Haller neglected to pay attention to the occurrence of the same word in Glisson's Anatomia hepatis , which appeared in 1654.7 This is all the more remarkable, since Haller did not claim a total neglect of the phe- nomena of irritability before Glisson.8 Modern historians are well aware of the fact that Glisson, in 1654, expressed opinions on irritability which he modified subsequently,9 till they reached the form given to them in the 4 Apart from the usual text books, I mention here : G.

I shall then try to relate these ideas to traditional, notably Galenic, physiology. " The classical roots of Glisson's doctrine of irritation " has been chosen as a title because irritation, rather than irritability in the strict sense, is the guiding concept in this phase of the general history of irritability.12 13 I. " Irritability " in the Anatomia hepatis 1. Glisson's notions of irritability in the Anatomia hepatis are mainly related to the discharge of bile. He divides what he calls vessels of the liver into gall bladder ( vesícula fellea), cystic duct ( meatus cysticus ), hepatic duct ( poms bilarius or ductus hepaticus) ,14 and common duct ( ductus communis).15 These vessels have a proper coat, the description of which reads in part : The tunica propria of these vessels also has fibres of every kind; viz. straight, transverse, and oblique. Unless I am mistaken, the oblique ones are more copious in the gall bladder, the transverse ones, however, in the other vessels. With the help of these fibres, all these vessels are ready to contract more or less, as well as to dilate, a matter which will be discussed at greater length later. lution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice Written in Honour of Charles Singer, vol. 1, London and New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1953, pp. 489-509, has examined Glisson's work from the point of view of Aristotelian vitalism. 10 Among others see Daremberg, op. cit. and E. F.

The anulus narrows the duct and thereby prevents incidental emptying of the bladder.22 Further, the oblique insertion of the common duct into the duodenum acts like a valve, impeding regurgitation of bile and the entrance of any fluid from the intestinal canal into the biliary vessels.28 On the basis of the above anatomical and physiological data, Glisson envisages the following mechanism regulating the flow of bile from the gall bladder.24 The presence of the anulus fibrosus makes it impossible for any humor to flow out of the gall bladder, unless it be expelled by some contraction or compression of the bladder.25 This raises the ques- tion as to what causes contraction of the gall bladder. Glisson assumes a continuous flow of bile from the liver to the bladder, which under normal conditions is moderately full.26 However, beyond this point a process comes into play which Glisson describes under the proposition : " The 18 A few remarks about the blood vessels have been omitted.

The truncus enters the gall bladder near the anulus fibrosus, about which see below. 21 Ibid., pp. 165, 171. 22 Ibid., p. 167. Boyden, op. cit., p. 224, note 10, identifies the anulus fibrosus with "the so-called 'Tobiens Sphincter' (1853) or the ' collum-cysticus sphincter' recently predi- cated by Luetkens ('26)." 28 Anatomia hepatis, ch. 16; pp. 174 and 175. Boyden, op. cit., has translated and analyzed Glisson's description of the insertion of the common duct into the duodenum and, p. 221, has particularly stressed Glisson's assignment of " ring-like fibres " to this part, liow called the sphincter of Oddi, which Glisson saw " contract by spontaneous motion." 24 Cf. Adolph, op. cit. 26 Anatomia hepatis, ch. 20; p. 213. 26 Ibid., ch. 20, Propositio prima; p. 212: "Vesicula fellea, suapte natura, et quandiu integra sanitate fruimur, semper moderate plena est."</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL ROOTS OF GLISSON^ DOCTRINE OF IRRITATION 301 gall bladder, when more than usually filled, and irritated [irritata], is relieved through the cystic duct." 27 ... if the gall bladder is uncommonly distended and is stuffed with more humor (than is its use and wont, or than it can easily bear), it is by necessity compelled to contract strongly, and to break down the restraint of its anulus and to emit the surcharge of the humor until it has regained its moderate fulness. For when this new burden 28 (the cause of the aforementioned irritation)29 has been removed, the bladder spontaneously rests and permits the anulus fibrosus to draw together again and to prevent the exit of the remaining humor. Immediately afterwards, Glisson supplies a general explanation of the above action, which, because of the importance of the terminology used, will also be cited. The general reason of this is that all sensitive [sensitivae] parts (among which the bladder is numbered, since it receives a little nerve from the sixth pair) are irritable [ irritabiles ]. Therefore, as soon as they are distended beyond their wont, or more than they can bear conveniently, or are otherwise burdened or provoked [lacessuntur] , they enter into immediate opposition. If the parts thus irritated [ irritatae ] are hollow, membranous, and fibrous, their resistance must needs occur through a contraction of all fibres, until their cavity is reduced to a smaller compass and some part at least of the humor contained therein is removed to the outside, all of which holds true of the gall bladder.30 At the insertion of the common duct into the intestine, similar events take place. As long as the insertion is closed, the bile flows back into the gall bladder. This return goes on until the quantity or quality of the humor powerfully irritates [ irritaverit ] the vessels so as to effect excretion. When this happens, the oblique insertion is forced to cede to the greater force, and it permits the vessels to deposit what is burdensome [ molestum ] into the intestines, whereupon it soon closes again.31 The resistance of the insertion is not easily overcome. Hence a relatively large amount of bile must accumulate, and the discharge into the intestines does not take place by a constant trickle ; rather the bile enters at intervals and then in a large quantity.32 Moreover, a number of pathological con- ditions may change the picture. In the first place, fibres and tunics of the 27 Ibid., ch. 20, Propositio quinta; p. 220: "Vesícula fellea plus solito impleta, atque irritata, per meatum cysticum exoneratur." 28 Ibid., p. 221 : " Sublato enim novo hoc onere," i. e., the surplus bile. 29 Irrixationis. 30 Ibid., p. 221. 81 Ibid., ch. 20, Propositio nona ; p. 230. 82 Ibid., ch. 20, Propositions nine and ten.</page><page sequence="6">302 OWSEI TEMKIN intestines may evince a certain tenseness,33 as is experienced after an astringent potion. On the other hand, the fibres (especially of the sphincter Oddi, as we would say) may be in a state of weakness and relaxation. Then the discharge takes place drop by drop, as in persons affected by a paralysis of the urinary bladder, when the urine escapes slowly and im- perceptibly all the time. Or the biliary vessels may be excessively irritated, in which case a condition analogous to stranguria or tenesmus prevails.34 The Anatomia hepatis was not the first book in which Glisson used the concept of irritation to explain organic self-regulation. In the treatise De rachitide of 1650 Glisson had discussed the factors that accounted for the distribution of the blood in the peripheral parts of the body. Among these factors he counted the irritation of the heart as well as of the arteries. The blood was thrust by the arteries into the peripheral parts with a certain pressure which gave rise to counter pressure in the receiving parts. This resistance provoked ( proritari ) the arteries to increase the pressure and make the pulse stronger. Where the resistance was weak, a strong pulse was not likely to be found. If the resistance was greater, without however subduing the arterial pressure, the pulse became more vigorous, other things being equal. Glisson exemplified this theory by reference to what happened when parts of the body became cold or hot owing to climatic conditions, or when the body moved, or when its parts were inflamed or contused. But strong resistance of the parts might yet fail to irritate the arteries effectively. In that case, resistance dulled the im- petus of the blood instead of intensifying it.35 Irritation, then, was a principle of which Glisson made operational use as early as the De rachitide. Its theoretical analysis was left to the Anatomia hepatis , to which we have to return. The very last chapter of the Anatomia hepatis deals with " the action and use of the lymph ducts or aqueous channels." 36 This chapter includes Glisson's speculations on the nutritive fluid carried by the nerves. The doctrine of nervous fluid, widespread though it was in the seventeenth 38 Ibid., ch. 20, Propositio octava , p. 228 : " Fibrarum, tunicarumque intestini tensltas (nam sic loqui libet) constrictioneni hanc facile roboraverit " (italics in the text). Glisson used the word tensitas repeatedly in his De rachitide sive morbo puerili tractatus, the first edition of which appeared in 1650 (I have used the third edition, Leyden, 1671). 84 Anatomia hepatis , Propositio decima; p. 232: "Fallit iterum, si vasa fellea ad excre- tionem moliendam summopere irritata fuerint. Idem enim tunc temporis ductui huic versus intestina contingit, quod in stranguria vesicae urinariae collo evenire solet, aut sphincteri ani in tenesmo, sive continuo desidendi conatu." 83 De rachitide, ch. 10; pp. 94-103. 86 Anatomia hepatis, ch. 45; p. 482: " De actione et usu lymphaeductuum, sive canalium aquosorum."</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSICAL ROOTS OF GLISSON^ DOCTRINE OF IRRITATION 303 century, concerns us only in so far as Glisson makes irritation the pro- pelling force of this fluid. Irritation, he argues, takes place from pleni- tude, from acrimony, and from vigoratio of the nerves,37 a term which Daremberg renders by mise en activité ,38 and which we may translate by " activation." Plenitude, being always molesting, necessarily stimulates ( exstimulet ) the part it burdens, an idea which we have already met in the discussion of the discharge of bile from the gall bladder. Acrimony of humors easily produces irritation. Normally, nutritive juice is not mordant. However, in sickness it can happen that this juice becomes acrid and, by plucking ( vellicando ) the nerves, induces fluxes. Finally, " activation [vigoratio] of the nerves (for we cannot express it otherwise) necessarily expels any humor that may have been in them." 39 This activation can have three causes: perception (or sensation), desire (appetitus), and muscular movement.40 A sense of pain, as well as a sensation of pleasure, activates the nerves. Desire too, if violent, " imparts strength to the nerves and provokes them [ irritât ] to motion, just as fear produces trepidation and, at the same time, causes a cold sweat. Perhaps the other psychic dispositions too stir up [ incitantur ] the nerves through all kinds of provocations [irritamentis] ." 41 Movement and exercise heat our bodies and thus add tension ( tensio ) and strength. 2. We have now become acquainted with the manner in which Glisson operates with such words as " stimulate," " irritable," " irritation," " to irritate," " irritated." A large part of the terminology which is still used today in connection with the doctrine of irritability is represented, except the word itself. However, the absence of this abstract noun is no impedi- ment to Glisson's explanations, which take it for granted that fibres and organs are " irritable." Glisson obviously assumes that his readers will understand his diction. Where terms that are new or unusual occur, he excuses himself, as for instance in the case of tensitas and vigoratio.42 Though Glisson's terminology concerns physiological events, it is frankly 37 Ibid., p. 547 ff . 38 Daremberg, op. cit ., p. 664. 39 Anatomia hepatis, p. 548: "Nervorum vigoratio (nam sic loqui cogimur). . . ." 40 Ibid., p. 549: "Tres autem sunt hujus vigorationis causae: nimirum perceptio , sive scnsatio ; appctitus ; et motus musculorum ." 41 Ibid. 42 See above, notes 33 and 39.</page><page sequence="8">304 OWSEI TEMKIN psychological and even anthropomorphic.43 The various parts behave like irritated people : they react because they have been " burdened " or " pro- voked.' ' 44 But with all this, Glisson cannot suppress a doubt regarding the relation- ship of irritable part and irritation. He tries to resolve this doubt in chapter forty-four, presenting the following argument.45 Subsequent to the intake of cathartics or emetics, a large amount of bile is evacuated, an amount much larger than that evacuated at other times. Nobody doubts that this difference presupposes irritation of the biliary vessels. However, this irritation could not take place if the biliary vessels were deprived of all sense. " Indeed, all irritation indicates the existence of perception : for whatever is provoked is immediately aroused into freeing itself from the injury that has been inflicted." But perception requires the presence of nerves. Without nerves, perception would not be possible, nor the subsequent motion which is implied in irritation. The argument can also be built on the anatomical fact that gall bladder and hepatic duct are endowed with nerves. Parts so endowed are sensitive and motive, hence irritable. " Indeed, whatever perceives an injury inflicted from some other source and engages in ridding itself of it will properly be said to be irritated." Therefore, the biliary vessels are " capable of irritation " ( irritationis capaces). This is a crucial point in Glisson' s position, reached by 1654 as far as his doctrine of irritation 46 is concerned. From what we heard about the " activation " of nerves and the three causes involved, we obtain an approximate picture of how Glisson visualized the activation of the biliary vessels. Apparently he had no difficulty in assigning perception and motion to the same nerve, since he considered them two stages of one phenomenon : irritation. However, he ran into a difficulty in postulating nervous action for a bodily process that takes place involuntarily and unconsciously. Motion mediated by nerves was usually considered psychic motion, i. e. exercised through the will. Glisson expressly says that the motion of the biliary vessels is not to be interpreted as psychic motion. What he has in mind is the kind of motion " we find in the stomach and intestines whereby a harmful thing is expelled." 48 Marion, op. cit., p. 127 : " C'est sous les traits du plus naif anthropomorphisme que sa théorie apparaît pour la première fois dans Y Anatomie du foie." 44 See above, note 13. 45 Because of the importance of this chapter a translation will be published in a subse- quent issue of this Bulletin. 48 Marion, op. cit., p. 128 rightly states that the concept of " irritation rather than of irritability " predominates in the Anatomia hepatis.</page><page sequence="9">THE CLASSICAL ROOTS OF GLISSON^ DOCTRINE OF IRRITATION 305 In thus referring to the expulsion of harmful agents by the stomach and intestines, Glisson again must have counted on some understanding on the part of his readers. At the same time he was referring to the activity of organs with which his Tractatus de ventrículo of 1677 was to deal. In this treatise the fibres were to be assigned " irritability " as their natural property. There is here an obvious connection between the two books. The difference in Glisson's position is characterized by the role assigned to the term irritability when it finally appears in the Anatomia hepatis. Irritation, Glisson reasons, can be original or by consensus with other parts showing original irritation. In view of his previous discussion of original irritation of the biliary vessels, he now concentrates on irritation by consensus. It involves the stomach and the intestines. If the latter organs are excessively irritated so that vomiting or diarrhea ensues, bile is also discharged in the vomited material or the stool. The explanation lies in the common nerve supply of these organs. In particular, the con- sensus affects that part of the hepatic nerve which enters into the common capsule of the porta. The biliary vessels are stimulated and compressed, and the vena portae is goaded into effecting a quicker transport of the abundant amount of blood. The advantages of this irritation by consensus are threefold. First, the participation of the biliary vessels effects a beneficial general evacuation, and the abstersive power of bile facilitates ridding the body of all kinds of impurities. Second, in cases where the biliary vessels have become in- sensible, their irritation can still be brought about by their consensus with the stomach and intestines. " This kind of irritability by consensus (if I may say so) has not been granted to them in vain."47 Finally, the consensus operates in both directions. The healthy irritation of the biliary vessels can impart itself to stomach and intestines, which now are better disposed to eliminate the plentiful supply of bile. Here then, for the first and only time, as far as I am aware, the term irritabilitas occurs in the Anatomia hepatis. As elsewhere,48 Glisson apologizes for the strange word, though the Latin text does not allow a clear decision whether the parenthesis refers to " irritability " only, or to " irritability by consensus." However, this question is of minor im- portance, because the introduction of the noun merely refers to one par- ticular abnormal condition and is mainly a matter of convenience. Never- 47 Anatomia hepatis , p. 481 : " Ideoque istiusmodi per consensum irritabilitas (ut sic dicam) haud frustra illis concessa est." 48 See above, notes 33, 39, and 42.</page><page sequence="10">306 OWSEI TEMKIN theless, the appearance of the noun is characteristic for Glisson's scholastic turn of mind. Having presumed that certain parts were " capable of irri- tation/' he proceeded to establish a " capability of being irritated/' when the context made the use of such a term convenient. II. The Galenic Doctrine of Irritation As Glisson sees it, irritation is the experience by some part of the body of a molesting sensation with ensuing attempts to remove the offending agent. In the Anatomia hepatis, Glisson believes this sensation (or per- ception) to be mediated by nerves which also mediate the movements towards removal of the agent. In the Tractatus de ventrículo , a " natural perception," independent of nerves, is assumed. Consequently, the parts of the organism, especially fibres, by themselves are assigned the capacity of being irritated, and this capacity is called " irritability." Glisson thereby generalizes a term introduced, but casually, in the Anatomia hepatis. Whatever philosophical reorientation was needed to bring about this change in outlook, " irritation " remains a central phenomenon for Glisson.49 The position which Glisson held in 1654 is of importance, because " irritation " and allied terms were presented in a manner close to the general understanding of the time. Glisson was justified in counting on his readers' familiarity with such words as irritation, irritable, to irritate, to stimulate, because these notions were imbedded in the Galenic physi- ology in which he and most of his medical contemporaries had been reared. 1. In Galenic parlance, the bile of the present context is yellow bile (in contrast to black bile).50 This bile is notoriously sharp and biting and exerts a cleansing action on all organs.51 Galen reasons that if much bile 49 R.

Thus when the stomach is sufficiently filled with the food and has absorbed and stored away the most useful part of it in its own coats, it then rejects the rest like an alien burden. The same happens to the bladders,57 when the matter attracted into them begins to give trouble either because it distends them through its quantity or stings 58 them by its quality.59 In the uterus, miscarriage as well as normal delivery is explained on a similar basis, so that Galen can sum up by claiming that In all organs, then, both their natural effects and their disorders and maladies plainly take place on analogous lines, some so clearly and manifestly as to need no demonstration, and others less plainly, although not entirely unrecognizable to those who are willing to pay attention.60 " Galen, ibid. ; ed.

For since it was shown that the gall-bladder attracts its own special juice, so as to be often found full, and that it discharges it soon after, this desire to discharge must be either due to the fact that it is burdened by the quantity or that the bile has changed in quality to pungent and acrid.62 Galen claims that bile, in contrast to food and even to urine, changes rapidly, a contention which conflicts with claims made elsewhere.63 At any rate, he concludes : Now, if there be clear evidence in relation to the uterus, stomach, and intestines, as well as to the urinary bladder, that there is either some distention, irritation [dexis], or burden inciting each of these organs to elimination, there is no difficulty in imagining this in the case of the gall-bladder also, as well as in the other organs, - to which obviously the arteries and veins also belong.64 Anatomically, the gall bladder is equipped with the means for con- traction. Though, according to On the Use of Parts , it possesses only one tunic, this tunic is provided with longitudinal, transverse, and oblique fibres. The transverse fibres, in particular, serve expulsion; when all three kinds of fibres contract simultaneously, the whole organ becomes contracted.65 2. The above passages from Galen's On the Use of Parts and On the Natural Faculties show far-reaching parallels with Glisson' s views on the nature of the bile and its evacuation into the intestinal canal. Galen's presentation easily fitted into the language of the Renaissance. Vesalius, 01 In On the Use of Parts, V, 8; ed. Helmreich, p. 274; Daremberg, p. 359, Galen states that the gall bladder receives a branch from the nerve supplying the liver, but that this branch is thin and hard to see. 02 On the Natural Faculties, III, 12; Loeb ed., pp. 287-289 (Brocks translation). 08 On the Use of Parts , V, 10; ed. Helmreich, p. 280; Daremberg, p. 364, Galen says that even after the death of an animal the gall bladder can be removed and inspected for a long time without showing any change and that nature rightly endowed the liver and gall bladder with little feeling (and very small nerves) because the residues they harbored did not incommodate them. 04 On the Natural Faculties, III, 12; Loeb ed., p. 289 (Brock's translation). 05 On the Use of Parts, V, 11; ed.

For if the bile flowed into the stomach, the latter (as Galen rightly affirms) would be perpetually provoked to discharge by the mordacity of the bile.66 As it is, the bile " irritating and biting at the intestines, . . . urges and stimulates them to discharge the faeces." 67 Similarly, Fernelius, speaking of the common duct, considers it the organ whereby the excess of bile is thrust out and expelled. For by it the intestines are wont to be aroused and provoked to the ejection of the faeces, as if a sharp goad had been employed, while the faeces themselves are tinged with a yellowish color.68 Guided by the example of the gall bladder, we can now inquire into the premises on which Galen based his explanation of the discharging mechanism of various organs. We must remember that, in contrast to Glisson's Anatomia hepatis, Galen, in the writings cited, faced the task of elaborating principles that would hold good for many organs, of which the gall bladder was but one. In particular, he devoted much attention to the stomach and intestines, which were to become the subject of Glisson's later work. Galen believed the organism and its parts to be endowed with a dis- charging faculty to which he gave various names, such as " propellent." " excretory," 69 " secretive." 70 It is the fourth of the natural faculties that serve the nutrition of the organs. Each part attracts the food it needs, retains it, alters (assimilates) it, and propels the surplus.71 In so far as the discharging faculty expels those things which are foreign to the e* Vesalius, Fabrica, Basel : Oporinus, 1543, lib.

Physiologically, it serves the elimination of waste material as well as the delivery of the fetus. Since waste material by itself is foreign to the body and harmful unless removed, there is an obvious connection between physiological and pathological conditions. In disease, the dis- charging faculty has to rid the body of noxious substances, thereby leading to the crisis.73 Miscarriage, abortion, normal delivery, as well as the expulsion of a disintegrating fetus, are all explained by the activation of the discharging faculty.74 " In all organs, then, both their natural effects and their disorders and maladies plainly take place on analogous lines.,, 75 Just as there is a connection between physiological and pathological conditions, so also there exists a connection between pathology and therapy in the discharge of material. To illustrate the forcefulness of the dis- charging faculty, Galen points to cases of ileus where intestinal content, to be vomited, has to traverse the small bowel, the pylorus, stomach, and esophagus.76 In this disease " the inflamed intestine is unable to support either the weight or the acridity of the waste substances and so does its best to excrete them, in fact to drive them as far away as possible." 77 What is here done by nature can also be done therapeutically, for instance by purgative drugs: in both cases, internal irritants ( dierethizonta ) account for the movements.78 Another example may be taken from Galen's Hygiene . When food begins to become spoiled in the stomach, passage of the spoiled substance is most salutary. " But in persons in whom it does not pass, one must provoke [erethisteon] passage by means of painless cathartics." 79 We may then say that for Galen provocation of the discharging faculty explains physiological, pathological, and therapeutic phenomena of the same order as those with which Glisson is dealing. It is, therefore, hardly surprising to find Glisson also thinking of this faculty. He says of bile that it " may simply pluck the excretory faculty of the bile vessels 73 Galen, On the Natural Faculties , III, 5 beginning ; Loeb ed., p. 244. 78 Ibid., I, 13; Loeb ed., p. 60, see also Brock's comment, p. 61, ftn. 3. 74 Ibid., III, 12 ; Loeb ed., p. 286 ; see also above, ftn. 58. 75 Ibid., Loeb ed., p. 287 (Brock's translation). 76 Ibid., III, 13; Loeb ed., p. 298. 77 Ibid., Loeb ed., p. 303 (Brock's translation). 78 Ibid., Loeb ed., p. 300. 79 Galen, De sanitate tuenda, VI, 7; ed.

Galen claims that the phenomena testify that there must exist in almost all parts of the animal a certain inclination towards, or, so to speak, an appetite for their own special quality, and an aversion to, or, as it were, a hatred of the foreign quality. And it is natural that when they feel an inclination they should attract, and that when they feel aversion they should expel.82 In short, for both Galen and Glisson irritation as a biological phe- nomenon is akin to the psychological reaction of man in a state of provo- cation and anger. 3. Up to a point, Galenic physiology allowed Glisson to count on his reader's understanding of his explanation of the physiology of the gall bladder. Galen's doctrine of the discharging faculty offered the common ground.83 However, Glisson believed sensation and nerves to be indis- pensable for the process of irritation. In exploring Galen's position in this matter, we are led to a paradoxical conclusion. Especially in his On the Use of Parts , Galen easily appears in agreement with Glisson. But the Galen of On the Natural Faculties and particularly Galen the inter- preter of Plato's Timaeus can also be seen as admitting sensation without nerves. There is thus an ambiguity in Galen's teaching which, in retro- spect, would allow us to connect him with the Anatomia hepatis as well as with the Tractatus de ventrículo . 80 Glisson, Anatomia hepatis, p. 160: "Sin vero bilis cum impetu descendent; aut vasorum felleorum excretricem facultatem, ob acrimoniam sui, aut copiam, plurimum vellicaverit. . . ." Similarly, p. 201. P. 230: " Alioquin enim, nisi vis excretoria in istis vasis [i.e. biliary vessels], obliquae insertionis in contrarium molimini praepolleret, natura utique suis rebus male consuluisset." 81 Ibid., p. 414 : ". . . excretricem intestinorum facultatem extimulat.,, 82 Galen, On the Natural Faculties, III, 6; Loeb ed., pp. 247-249 (Brock's translation). Brock, p. 248, ftn. 1, points out the "use of psychological terms in biology." 83 Dar ember g, op. cit., (ftn. 4), p. 659, speaks of "le souvenir des facultés naturelles de Galien qu'on retrouve dans la théorie de Glisson." In the Anatomia hepatis the parallel is stronger than in the Tractatus de ventrículo, where Daremberg's dictum of "un mélange souvent inextricable, des facultés naturelles de Galien et de l'archéisme de Van Helmont" (p. 256) holds true. Augustus Gottlob Weber, Commentatio de initiis ac progressibus irritabilitatis, Diss. Halle 1782, also points out the parallel between Galen's natural faculties and the doctrine of irritability. Generally speaking, Weber goes too far in finding traces of " irritability " in a large variety of ancient authors ; at the same time he is satisfied with a very superficial analysis of the congruences.</page><page sequence="16">312 OWSEI TEMKIN Galen listed the discharging faculty among the natural faculties, which by definition were independent of the rational soul, i. e. of feeling and voluntary motion.84 Though in many cases, such as in the normal passage of food through the alimentary canal, our consciousness is not involved, still, we become painfully aware of any molestation. In child labor this is obvious even under normal conditions, but the urinary bladder offers perhaps the most striking example. Galen said that it " continues to collect urine up to the time that it becomes uncomfortable through the increasing quantity of urine or the irritation [ děchtheisan ] caused by its acidity. . . ." 85 Anatomically, sensation presupposed nerves according to Galenic doctrine. In line with this reasoning, Galen assigned to the nerves a threefold purpose : sensibility in the organs of perception, movement in the organs of locomotion, and " to all others [i. e. organs] the recognition of distressing things." 86 Hunger, for instance, is a sensation which Galen located in the cardia, and he classified the latter among the organs of perception, like the inside of the hand.87 Generally, however, he said of the organs of nutrition that none of them was a sense organ or an organ of movement. Hence the nerves given to all of them had needs be small and for the third use only, so that they might be able to distinguish what would cause distress. For if this too were lacking and they were insensible of the sufferings within them, nothing would prevent animals from being destroyed in a very short time. For as it is now, when we feel a sting [ dêxeõs ] in the intestines, we forthwith hasten to get rid of the distressing thing. If, however, [the intestines] were completely insensible, they would, I think, easily become ulcerated and would all be corroded and made to putrify by the waste material that collects and flows into them daily. . . .88 The sensibility of an organ, moreover, depends on the number and volume of the nerves with which it is supplied.89 Thus the gall bladder possesses fewer nerves than the stomach, uterus, and urinary bladder. But is noci-perception always associated with awareness of pain or discomfort? Galen does not seem to offer a clear answer to this question. He believed that the brain, the seat of sensation and volition, extended to the very 84 Galen, On the Natural Faculties, I, 1 ; Loeb ed., p. 2. 86 Ibid., III, 5; Loeb ed., p. 245 (Brock's translation). 86 Galen, On the Use of Parts , V, 9; ed.

Interesting as such a hypothesis is, there is no certainty of its having been maintained by Galen.93 Regarding the manner in which organs effected a discharge, Galen offered two possibilities. In the first place, every part had its tonos symphytos ,94 an innate tension. The different parts of the body were not in a constant dynamic equilibrium. Not only were some parts stronger than others in absolute terms (e. g. the heart had a greater attracting power than the liver),95 their relative strength also varied under different circumstances. If the tension of a part, temporarily at least, became weaker than that of its stronger neighbor, the latter would be able to pass on its surplus material to it. A passage from stronger to weaker parts and a deposit in the weakest would thus explain the condition of a morbid flux.96 The other mechanism, already explained in relation to the gall bladder, was more often cited by Galen. The discharge of waste material, just as 90 The idea of the pneuma psychikon is too well known to need elaboration. For the light-like principle see below, ftn. 100. 91 The main passage is in Galen, De Hippocratis et Piatonis pia ci tis, VII, 7 ; ed. Kühn, vol. 5, pp. 641 and 644.

Gesch. d. Med., 1912, 5: 172-224 (pp. 222-224). I think that Meyer-Steineg's argument is vitiated by his crediting Galen with a notion of " stimulation " ( Reis ) foreign to him. 98 See above, ftn. 61. 98 It is, however, true that such quantitative notions made Galen believe that deep or light sleep depended on the relative quantity of the influent faculty from the brain to the rest of the body ; see De symptomatum causis , I, 8 ; Kühn ed. vol. 7, p. 144. 94 On the Natural Faculties , III, 13 ; Loeb ed., p. 296.

Straight (longitudinal) fibres served attraction, and oblique fibres retention. The discharging faculty acted through the trans- verse fibres; it was the motions of these fibres which performed the ex- cretory functions.98 The presence of nerves was not postulated for this function, since these fibres did not constitute muscles.99 4. Galen tried to distinguish between natural organs (primarily those of the abdomen) and the psychic organs, (subject to sense perception and will). All organs, natural and psychic alike, needed veins and arteries, because they underwent metabolic change and had their share in the bodily heat. In so far, then, even the psychic organs were also " natural," otherwise they would not be alive. However, the functions of the natural organs were inborn; and these functions, therefore, could be damaged only if the organs themselves were damaged. The psychic organs, on the other hand, needed nerves to supply them with the principles of sensation and movement, " as the sun furnishes light to all things on which it shines." 100 They could lose their function without being hurt themselves, when their communication with the brain was intercepted.101 This seemingly clear distinction was complicated by the occurrence of discomfort and pain in the natural organs and by their being supplied with nerves which made noci-perception possible. Whether or not this per- ception was bound to be conscious was a question to which we were not able to find a clear answer in Galen. To this ambiguity is now added another major difficulty. Could the natural faculties be denied sensation and motion altogether, or was some sort of sensation and motion neces- sarily associated with them, though not of the kind carried by the nerves ? All the facts confirm, Galen said, 97 At least attraction of food at a distance ; see Meyer- Steineg, op. cit., Sudhoff s Arch, f. Gesch. d. Med., 1913, 6 : 431 f. In attracting its food from the immediate surroundings, the attracting faculty acted similarly to a magnet. (See On the Natural Faculties, III, 15.) 98 On the Use of Parts , IV, 17; ed.

This question concerned the natural organs not only of the animal body; it also concerned plants, which lived by the natural faculties. The organic nature of plants and their ability to nourish themselves were issues on which Plato and Aristotle too had speculated. According to Aristotle, plants had neither locomotion nor sensation,103 but they possessed a kind of soul which they shared with animals. This soul was the capacity to grow, to be nourished, to continue to live " as long as they are able to absorb food," 104 and to decay.105 " This capacity to absorb food," Aristotle added, " may exist apart from all other powers, but the others cannot exist apart from this in mortal beings." 106 Hence Aristotle assumed that the sensitive faculty of animals included the nutri- tive,107 whereas plants " have the nutritive faculty only." 108 Aristotle's " nutritive soul " 109 reappeared in Galen's " vegetative soul," which he admitted as a synonym for " nature " in animals and man.110 Galen's own answer to the problem is given in his interpretation of a short passage of Plato's Timaeus.111 As Galen stated it, the problem was : "In what way do we say that they [i.e. the natural faculties] attract what is familiar, but reject what is foreign?"112 This seemed to pre- 102 Galen, On the Natural Faculties , III, 5; Loeb ed., p. 245 (Brock's translation). 103 Aristotle, On the Soul, 410 b 23 and 435 bl.

As Karl</page><page sequence="20">316 OWSEI TEMKIN suppose a discriminatory perception of what was familiar and foreign. And this, in turn, seemed to presuppose a sensory function on the part of the natural faculties. The solution, according to Galen, was to be found in Plato's attribution to plants of a genus of sensation different from sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Plants can merely discover what is nourishing, and what is not. Hence Plato seems to me to speak rightly when he says that plants have sensation, namely of what is familiar and what is foreign, and thus may suitably be called living beings, since, at the same time, they are not without autonomous movement. But because such inquiry is not necessary for medical philosophy, I am content - having gone as far as the limit of the plausible, and that merely in order to be consistent - to praise Plato, who calls plants living beings and says that they partake only of a discriminating perception of things familiar and foreign. If considered accurately, this seems to be of the category of what is pleasant and unpleasant. For on no other account can one say that they attract the familiar or assimilate it to themselves, except for the sake of enjoyment and the pleasure engendered in them. But, as I said, for medicine it suffices to know this alone, that they attract the familiar, whereby they are also nourished, but reject the foreign. For ethical philosophy the exact inquiry into such things is even more useless, wherefore Plato did not have it in mind either.113 Elsewhere Galen again confirmed his interpretation of Plato: For in the commentaries on the natural faculties 114 we have shown that they [i. e. plants] possess a cognitive faculty for familiar substances, which nourish them, and for foreign substances, which harm them. Hence they attract the familiar substances but turn away and reject the foreign. Therefore Plato said that the plants participate in a special genus of sensation, for it makes known what is familiar and what is foreign.115 Finally, Galen dared his detractors, who derided him for distinguishing three faculties and for locating in the brain the principle of the nerves and purposeful movements, and also of the five senses; in the liver the principle of blood and veins and of nourishment of the body, as well as of making known what is familiar substance and what foreign in this respect; in the heart, the principle of arteries, inborn heat, and pulsation.116 Kalbfleisch, " Zu Galenos," Philologus, 1896, 55 : 689-694, has shown, this fragment is really part of Galen's Peri tõn heautõi dokountõn, of which G. Helmreich published another fragment in Philologus, 1894, 52 : 431-434. 118 Galen, De substantia ; ed. Kühn, vol. 4, p. 765 f. 114 Schröder (see the following footnote), p. 42, discusses the question whether this refers to On the Natural Faculties. Galen, In Platonis Ttmaeum commentant fragmenta, ed.

This principle was situated in the liver; in Platonic terms it was the concupiscent soul.117 This means that all organic beings possessed such a sense rooted in their nature, as well as some kind of motion, since rejection or discharge could not be accomplished otherwise. These, sensation and motion, had to be independent of the psychic soul and of the nervous system, since their principle was in the liver. To sum up: The Galenic doctrine of irritation could be understood in two different ways. Irritation meant an attempt by an organ (or a part of it) to eliminate material which the organ experienced as disturbing. To the extent that such experience and action were directly credited to the discharging faculty possessed by every living part, irritation was dependent on perception sui generis ; it was not dependent on the aware- ness of pain or on the existence of nerves. To the extent that the percep- tion of an injuring agent was believed a function of the nerves, the latter appeared essential. Through them a feeling of discomfort or pain was experienced in the organ. Whether or not this feeling was always accom- panied by awareness remains a moot question. Galen himself probably thought that he had offered a consistent expla- nation of the interplay of " natural " and " psychic " faculties and of the role of nerves in the phenomenon of irritation. He did not overlook the need for integrating vegetative organs into the animal organism. The heart, lungs, and abdominal organs all have a share in the nerves, " so that they partake of some sensation and may not be plants alto- gether." 118 But this statement gives a formal consistency rather than a real synthesis of divergent modes of accounting for the phenomena of irritation. Even within the framework of the classical tradition the doctrine of irritation could present itself in different ways.119 The dif- 117 Paul Kraus and Richard Walzer (editors and translators), Galeni compendium Timaei Platonis, London: Institute Warburg, 1951 (Plato Arabus, vol. 1), p. 81: " Deinde dixit : Et creavit Deus - qui honore et maiestate eminet - plantas propter hominis nutrimentum, et in eis unam animae speciem, id est concupi scentem, posuit."

We have already seen this in Glisson, and it is to be seen also in Caesalpinus and Harvey, both of whom preceded Glisson. III. Caesalpinus and Harvey 1. Caesalpinus The Quaestiones medicinales of Caesalpinus contain a chapter entitled : " Animals completely deprived of the sense of touch cannot be nourished.,, 120 This title supports an Aristotelian thesis, as is to be expected of Caesal- pinus, the peripatetic philosopher. But the argument leans heavily on Galen; indeed, Caesalpinus uses the ambiguities in Galen's doctrine to convict him out of his own statements. Caesalpinus states that nutrition is accomplished by attraction, retention, concoction, and expulsion of the excrements. Attraction presupposes a feeling of familiarity with the substances needed. On the other hand, nature does not expel what is foreign " unless she is irritated." 121 Neither of these two phenomena could happen without the sense of touch, the food sense according to Aristotle, who concluded that animals must die if deprived of this sense.122 But Galen, as Caesalpinus argues, leans on Plato, taking it that the natural soul 123 possesses the sense to distinguish between the familiar and foreign, though this sense is different from the five senses. Thus Galen asserts that natural organs " have an inner power by which they bring about their actions, while the psychic ones have a power which flows into them from a principle, as the light from the sun." 124 In conse- quence of this thought, natural actions can be damaged only if the organs themselves are affected, whereas psychic actions can suffer if the organs haben, bei eingehender Erwägung die wirkliche Beseelung bis auf die Pflanzen auszudeh- nen." In evidence of this Siebeck (note 53, p. 497) refers to the passage in Galen's commentary on the Timaeus cited above. In fairness to Galen it has to be added that he discussed the phenomena of irritation rather than conceptualizing irritation, as Glisson did. 120 Andreas Caesalpinus, Quaestionum pcripateticarum lib.

Yet according to Aristotle, Caesalpinus avers, plants have no sensa- tion.125 Hence the nutrition takes place " without any recognition of the food." 126 Animals, on the other hand, need the sense of touch, which is their food sense. Their nerves, as Galen pointed out, extend to the viscera " so that they may feel what brings pain." According to Galen, the pur- pose of their endowment is " that the irritated parts 127 may expel what molests them and retain the beneficial." This proves that sensation is necessary for natural actions. Galen carefully explains this by drawing attention to the dire consequences that would befall animals if noxious excrements were allowed to accumulate in the organs of nutrition because of a lack of sensation. Moreover, as Galen has it, a blow on the spine can lead to a loss of feeling in the internal parts and to a suppression of urine and excrements.128 However, contrary to Galen's belief, this can happen before these parts are inflamed, which shows that their function suffers by consensus 129 when the psychic faculty does not reach them via the nerves. Furthermore, if, as Galen has it, all movement starting from a natural faculty is brought about by fibres, " and if the fibres are nervous bodies and endowed with sense," 130 they must originate from the same organ as the nerves and sensation. In fact, the movements are called natural because they are involuntary, as are movements in epileptic convulsions, rigor, or hiccup. " For, although these movements may take place in the muscles or in the nervous parts,131 or in the brain itself, they are never- theless natural, because they are brought about involuntarily by the ex- creting faculty, provided that the faculty has been irritated by the sense of a noxious thing." 132 Caesalpinus draws a distinction between nutrition of plants and of animals, a distinction made explicit in the rest of the chapter, which deals with various pros and cons of his thesis. Because they are fixed, plants do not select food as animals do. " The spirit suffices for the attraction 125 The reference is to Aristotle, De animo, 435 bl. 128 Caesalpinus, op. cit., fol. 226 v. 127 Ibidņ, fol. 226 v. : "particulae irritatae." 128 The reference is to Galen's commentary 3, ch. 51, on Hippocrates' De articulís, ed. Kühn, vol. 18 A, p. 562 f. 129 Caesalpinus. op. cit., fol. 227 r. 130 Ibid., fol. 227 r. : " fibrae autem nervosa corpora sunt et sensu praedita."

This latter opinion is bolstered by the declaration of fibres as " nervous bodies." To remove the possible objection that allegedly non-sentient parts (bone, cartilage, the medulla of the brain) can be nourished, Caesalpinus, at the end of the chapter, emphasizes " that there is no particle in the animal that does not receive some measure of power of feeling." For the bones participate more or less in sense through the membranes which are called periostea, the teeth through the nerves distributed to their roots, the flesh of the intestines, the brain, and the spinal cord, through their membranes. The sense is more exquisite in the membranes, because their substance is nervous.134 Caesalpinus' argument fundamentally circles around the denial of sensa- tion different from, and independent of, the senses, particularly that of touch, a sensation that would be in the parts of animals and plants. In consequence of this thesis, he asserts that all parts of the body are supplied with nervous elements to give them sensation, and the fibres are declared to be nervous bodies, though the exact meaning of these assertions remains unclear. Together with his Aristotelian bias, Caesalpinus accepts the Galenic doctrine of the discharging faculty and the role of irritation. 2. Harvey As is well known, Harvey refuted Galen's explanation of the diastole of the heart. During the diastole, which Galen had attributed to contrac- tion of the heart's longitudinal fibres,135 the heart, in Harvey's view, was passive, the initial force coming from the blood that rose like a fermenting 133 Ibid., fol. 227 r-v. 134 Ibid., fol. 227 v. Caesalpinus' views of " nervous " parts in general, and membranes 3n particular, is not altogether clear. This unclarity was inherited from Galen. Though *Galen distinguished between nerves, ligaments, and tendons, he bequeathed an unclear notion of "nervous bodies." In his Commentaries on Hippocrates' Aphorisms (ed. Kühn, vol. 17 B, p. 783) he says: "They [i.e. neurõdea somata] are cords [tonoi], ligaments, muscles, and tendons." By tonoi he may mean nerves. On the Use of Parts , XVI, 2; ed. Helmreich, vol. 2, p. 379; Daremberg, vol. 2, p. 160, however, expressly denies nerves to ligaments. 185 Galen, On the Use of Parts , VI, 8; ed. Helmreich, p. 320; Daremberg, vol. 1, p. 402.</page><page sequence="25">THE CLASSICAL ROOTS OF GLISSON^ DOCTRINE OF IRRITATION 321 substance.136 The active role of the heart consisted in its contraction due to the forced dilation and leading to a propulsion of the blood. Harvey considered this explanation equally valid for the embryonic heart and for that of the adult. For, as there are two parts in a pulsation, viz. : distension or relaxation, and contraction, or diastole and systole, and, as distension is the prior of these two motions, it is manifest that this motion proceeds from the blood; the contraction, again, from the vesicula pulsans of the embroyo in ovo, from the heart in the pullet, in virtue of its own fibres, as an instrument destined for this particular end. Certain it is, that the vesicle in question, as also the auricle of the heart at a later period, whence the pulsation begins, is provoked [ irritavi ] to the motion of contraction by the distending blood.137 By the contraction of the auricles, the blood is propelled into the ventricles, " and the ventricles, thus replete and distended, are stimulated [ sollicitant ] to contraction, and this motion always precedes the systole, which follows immediately afterwards." 138 Harvey, as does Glisson shortly afterwards, made the fibres contract when they were forcibly distended. From all that has been said before, this must have seemed understandable on the basis of contemporary Galenic principles. However, Harvey differed from Galen in declaring the heart a muscle,139 and he differed from Aristotle in assigning supremacy to the blood over the heart.140 Both points have an important bearing on Harvey's view of irritation. Galen emphatically denied that the heart was a muscle.141 Though heart 136 Harvey, "Second Disquisition to John Riolan"; Robert Willis (translator), The Works of William Harvey , M.D., London: Sydenham Society, 1847, p. 132; Guilielmi Harveii Opera omnia , a Collegio Medicorum Londonensi edita, London, 1763, p. 132.

Those of the muscles are " parts of nerves and ligaments," whereas " the heart has a particular kind of fibres as have the tunics of artery and vein, the intestines and stomach, uterus, and both bladders. For in all these organs, too, the particular flesh will be seen enveloping the fibres particular to them." 142 Whereas muscles through their nerves are subject to will, " the power of pulsation has its origin in the heart itself ... by the high virtue of some special element in its nature." 143 Harvey, however, called the heart a muscle because it acted and func- tioned like a muscle, " namely to contract and move something else, in this case, the charge of blood." 144 On the other hand, " neither the heart nor anything else can dilate or distend itself so as to draw aught into its cavity during the diastole, unless, like a sponge, it has been first com- pressed, and as it is returning to its primary condition." 145 This denied Galen's " attraction " through contraction of the longitudinal fibres and tended to confuse the theory of the natural faculties altogether. Indeed, Harvey substituted a modification which rested on his un-Aristotelian assumption of the supremacy of the blood. Harvey's embryological investigations indicated to him that the blood was the " primogenate " particle embodying the primary vital principle.146 All the parts of the body received life from the blood ; 147 the cardiovascular apparatus was constructed for impelling and distributing the blood.148 Aristotle's thesis of the primacy of the heart was tenable only if by heart was understood " that which first appears in the embryo of the chick in ovo, the blood to wit, with its containing parts - the pulsating vesicles and veins, as one and the same organ." 149 The blood possessed both sense and motion,150 and Harvey went so far as to say that " the blood perceives 142 Galen, De temperamentis, II, 3; ed.

When the latter is as yet nothing but " a limpid fluid," the mucilaginous body of the embryo, " if lightly pricked, will move obscurely, will contract and twist itself like a worm or caterpillar, so that it is very evidently possessed of sensation." 152 What the physicians called natural movements and actions, i. e. those not subject to our will, were independent of the brain but indicated the presence of sensation, " inasmuch as they are aroused, provoked, and changed thereby." 153 Harvey illustrated this first of all by various morbid conditions of the heart, attributed to causes afflicting its sensation. "For whatever by its divers movements strives against irritations [irritamento] and troubles must necessarily be endowed with sensation." 154 There fol- lowed examples : the stomach must have a sense whereby it could dis- tinguish between what is noxious and useful. Even the flesh distinguished poison from non-poison. Various affections, inconveniences, and irrita- tions [irritamento'] of the uterus did not depend on the brain or the sensus communis ; still, they could not be deemed to occur without any sense. For that which is wholly without sense is not seen to be irritated [irritavi] by any means, neither can it be excited [ excitari ] to motion or action of any kind. Nor have we any other means of distinguishing between an animate and sentient thing and one that is dead and senseless than the motion excited by some other irritating [ irritante ] cause or thing, which as it incessantly follows, so does it also argue sensation.155 This declaration, in which motion excited by irritation indicated sensation and separated living from lifeless things, is very reminiscent of Glisson.156 Yet there is this difference: Glisson of the Anatomia hepatis postulated the intermediacy of nervous function; Harvey established a clear-cut separation between what was consciously perceived by the sensorium com- mune, i. e. the brain, and " a certain sense or form of touch which is not referred to the common sensorium, nor in any way communicated to the brain, so that we do not perceive by this sense that we feel."157 In 151 Ibid., p. 380; Opera , p. 396; " eum et irritantis injuriam et foventis commodum persentiscere manifestum est." 152 Ibid., exercise 57, Willis' translation, p. 430. 153 Ibid., p. 431 (Willis' translation, adapted) ; Opera, p. 449: " utpote a quo excitentur, irritentur et permutentur." 154 Ibid., (Willis' translation) ; Opera, p. 450. 155 Ibid., p. 432 (Willis' translation, adapted) ; Opera, p. 450 f. 16 See above, p. 304. 157 Harvey, On Generation, exercise 57, Willis' translation, p. 432.</page><page sequence="28">324 OWSEI TEMKIN particular, there existed a psychic sense of touch as distinct from a natural sense of touch, the latter not communicated to the sensorium commune and representing a different species. Likewise, purposeful muscular motions were distinct from mere muscular contraction and movement. Convulsive motions from an irritating ( irritante ) cause were like the uncoordinated movements of a decapitated cock or hen. All this is summed up in Harvey's following statement : We therefore conceive the fact to be that all the natural motions proceed from the power of the heart, and depend on it; the spontaneous motions, however, and those that complete any motion which physicians entitle a psychic motion, cannot be performed without the controlling influence of the brain and common sensation.158 Galen, denying the muscular nature of the heart, had classified it with the other viscera that attract, retain, and discharge.159 Harvey, declaring the heart a muscle and refusing it any sucking power, had put himself into clear opposition to Galen. By his peculiar vitalization of the blood, which even allowed it to react to irritation, he had also come to group the motion of the heart with the other natural motions. Fibres contracted, but so did all living tissue, which, when irritated, revealed its power of sensation through its motion. There existed a sense of touch different from the conscious sense and independent of the brain. Here Harvey differed not only from Caesalpinus, but also from the Glisson of the Anatomia hepatis. He came closer to the " natural perception " of the Glisson of the Tractatus de ventricido .16° IV. Conclusion Glisson' s doctrine of irritation has been shown to be deeply rooted in the classical tradition, which means the teaching of the schools prevailing during the first half of the seventeenth century. With the possible excep- tion of anatomy, this teaching, in the schools of medicine, was largely 158 Ibid., p. 433 (Willis' translation) ; Opera, p. 452.

Helmreich, p. 320 ; Daremberg, vol. 1, p. 402. 160 Walter Charleton, Enquiries Into Human Nature, London, 1680, p. 109, may have been the first to point to the relationship between Harvey (and Campanella) on the one hand and Glisson on the other. Campanella and Harvey, Charleton states, called natural touch (as distinct from the animal sense of touch) what " Dr. Glisson, coming after to consider the thing more Metaphysically, and founding the very life or substantial Energie of Nature wholly upon the same, denominated . . . Perceptio Naturalis , thereby to distinguish it from all the Senses, as well internal, as external. . . ." See Richard A.

Though Galen did not con- ceptualize " irritation " as Glisson did, both dealt with the same kind of phenomena in a very similar way. Galen's explanation of the phenomena of irritation was not unequivocal. Caesalpinus, adhering to Aristotle, re- jected the idea of a cognitive element in the natural faculties, an idea much more consonant with Harvey's views in spite of the latter's well-known divergences from Galen. While paying attention to the Galenic roots of Glisson' s doctrine, we have omitted from our consideration other influences, possibly that of Campanella, and particularly that of van Helmont.161 As far as I can see, van Helmonťs influence is not yet noticeable in the Anatomia hepatis, though it is obvious in the Tractatus de ventrículo . Why and when Glis- son turned to van Helmont is a question made all the more interesting, because Galen's " Platonizing " passages and the example of Harvey per- mitted a natural perception without the intermediacy of nerves. Yet in the Tractatus de ventrículo , natural perception was identified with the Archeus.1*2 Whatever van Helmonťs own indebtedness to the classical tradition may have been,163 he could hardly be considered a traditionalist. The association of the Archeus with natural perception, as Haller's testi- mony shows,164 helped to obscure Glisson' s relationship to Galenic medi- cine. In some respects, this is symptomatic of events in the history of medicine in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Galen's notion of an inborn tonus ( tonos symphytos )165 which goes beyond that of the postural muscular tonus, the history of which Sherrington 166 also traced back to Galen, is another example for the viability of classical biology. 101 For van Helmonťs contribution to the history of irritability, see Francis B.

Glisson's ideas of 1654 were overshadowed by his later elaboration of the concept of irritability. As Virchow once remarked, irritation presupposes irritability.167 Much of what we discussed in this essay concerned the attributes which organs must possess in order to exhibit irritation. For Glisson, life was marked by the unity of perception (perceptio) , striving ( appetitus ), and motion ( motus ). This unity was implied in his explanation of irritation of 1654, 168 it was made explicit in the Tractatus de natura substantiae energetica , and it was reiterated in the Tractatus de ventrículo ,169 Glisson's extension of the principle of life to all matter, important though it is for his philosophical position,170 is of little concern in our present context, which is limited to biological phe- nomena. Within the biological context this unity can also be read into Galen's views of the natural faculties, especially the discharging faculty, and Harvey's criteria of life, even if the three factors were not equally accentuated. But it must not be overlooked that " irritation " is fundamentally oriented towards pathology, where it still has its assured place. Galen and Glisson used it to elucidate physiological processes of a kind where an obstacle had to be overcome, or where foreign, molesting, or poten- tially harmful matter was to be eliminated. This limited its physiological usefulness. Galen could connect it with the discharging faculty; but he had to find different interpretations for physiological events which we attribute to iritability as a reaction to change in the environment. By crystallizing the notion of irritability out of the concept of irritation, so to speak, Glisson in 1677 clarified the physiological presupposition implied in " irritation." Thereby he helped to initiate the period in the history of " irritability " when this concept was no longer onesidedly oriented towards pathology.171 167 Rudolf Virchow, op. cit., ftn. 161 above, pp. 1 and 63. On p. 7 f. of this article Virchow offers a definition of " irritation " substantially identical with that of Glisson, though adapted to the cell; see Erwin H. Ackerknecht, Rudolf Virchow, Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1953, p. 152. On Virchow as a vitalist ibid., p. 50.

(above, ftn. 9), p. 503 ff. 171 In van Helmonťs Archeus Glisson may have found a broader biological basis than Galen's discharging faculty offered him ; see Pagel, " Helmont. Leibnitz. Stahl," p. 23.</page><page sequence="31">THE CLASSICAL ROOTS OF GLISSON^ DOCTRINE OF IRRITATION 327 Today we tend to replace physiological irritability by " excitability." However, one of the functions of the historiography of ideas is to make us aware of hidden ingredients in our conceptual tools. For this purpose we must beware of destroying or changing the images associated with the words we use. We have stressed the dependence of irritation on the picture of an angry man. As long as we speak of irritability we also preserve the association with this particular mental state. When we speak of excitability we change the association. How far psychological associations are still present in the minds of modern physiologists is a question on which I am not going to enter here.172 As far as scientists of the nineteenth century are concerned, the dependence of the explanation of somatic processes on psychological analogies can easily be demonstrated.173 Just as Galen and Glisson (and, we may add, Bichat and many others) before him, so Claude Bernard too had to deal with the problem of unconscious perception. By referring to reflex action, he was able to circumvent some of the difficulties that had beset Galen,174 Harvey, and Glisson. Thus Claude Bernard could write : One might think that there is no sensibility in the internal organs. Indeed, we are not conscious of any manifestations of their sensibility. However, though the nerves which they receive are ordinarily unable to transmit the impressions of conscious sensibility, they [i.e. the organs] nevertheless have a particular sensi- bility, without consciousness, to which the name reflex sensibility has been given.175 But, reflex or not, the meaning of sensibility had to be explained. How Bernard thought about it evinces from his subsequent discussion. Upon the arrival of food in the stomach, movement and secretions take place (as Beaumont had observed). 172 It seems at least permissible to raise the question whether words like " stimulus " and " response " are quite free from psychological associations. 178 The very plea made by Ewald Hering for liberation from psychological terminology and the difficulties which he admitted are characteristic. Ewald Hering, " In wie fern ist es möglich, die Physiologie von der Psychologie sprachlich zu trennen?", Deutsche Arbeit , 1901-1902, 1 : 946-951. (I am indebted to Professor Maurice Mandelbaum for a copy of this article.) 174 Galen had to ascribe to degrees of consciousness such acts as breathing and moving in one's sleep; see Siebeck, Geschichte der Psychologie , p. 273 f. (Professor Ludwig Edelstein has drawn my attention to this discussion) ; and Georges Canguilhem, La formation du concept de réflexe aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles , Paris: Presses universi- taires de France, 1955, p. 15 f. 175 Claude Bernard, Leçons sur la physiologie et la pathologie du système nerveux, vol. 1, Paris: Baillière, 1858, p. 321.</page><page sequence="32">328 OWSEI TEMKIN There obviously exists a perceived sensation ( une sensation perçue ) ; one can become certain of this by cutting the nerves which are distributed to the organ: from that moment on the reaction is impeded, and the arrival of food in the stomach causes there neither movements nor secretions.176 To speak of sensation perceived by the stomach can have meaning only if conscious perception serves as the model. Similarly Glisson had argued for the gall bladder that discharge of bile depended on perception and that this perception, as well as the ensuing motion, depended on the presence of nerves. Let us say then that he, as well as Galen, had used a psychological model. The naive and ubiquitous use of such models by the old physiologists has led to the accusation of animism and anthropomorphism. The history of irritability shows that the facts leading to the accusation cannot be denied. The designation of such modes of thinking as anthropomorphic is quite correct. But before turning this designation into an accusation, it will be worth while to consider why men like Galen and Glisson, who were no fools, so easily accepted anthropomorphic explanations. Galen was shocked by the atomism of Asclepiades and the mechanistic thinking of Erasistratus, both of which he deemed inadequate and attacked in On the Natural Faculties. Whatever we may think about the possibility today of reducing physiology to the level of physics, we know that such a possi- bility did not exist in previous centuries. If we disregard metaphysical or religious reasons for preferring the one or the other, we have to admit that psychological models were not necessarily more fantastic than mechanical ones for such processes as assimilation of food, growth, and reaction to stimuli. The very success in elucidating the mechanical component of a complex biological process could bring into relief the need for a different explana- tion of the remaining part of the process. Harvey, who showed that the circulation of the blood could be attributed to the pumping action of the heart, at the same time had recourse to fermentation and irritation to account for the heart's diastole and systole. His appeal to irritation, which Descartes suspected as an appeal to an occult faculty,177 was biologically more fruitful than Descartes' own reference to the action of heat. Haller' s great contribution was the freeing of the phenomena of irritability from both anthropomorphic and mechanistic models and the subjecting of them to experimental biological criteria. 17a Ibid., p. 322. 177 This point has been brought out by J. A. Fassmore, "William Harvey and tne philosophy of science," The Australasian J. Philosophy, 1958, 36: 85-94.
