<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUHYUNG RHI READING COOMARASWAMY ON THE ORIGIN OF THE BUDDHA IMAGE I Out of Ananda Coomaraswamy's numerous contributions to Indian art scholarship, the best remembered is probably reclaiming - or claiming - a primary role played by Indians in the ori gin of the Buddha image. His unflagging pursuit of the issue through the persistent refuting of the theory of the so-called "Greek origin," which had dominated scholarly minds until the early twenti eth century, succeeded over several decades in persuading most scholars to admit that the Buddha image was created simultaneously in Mathur? (in India proper) and Gandh?ra (on the northwestern border of the subcontinent). The idea is treated nowadays in academia as conventional wisdom - or an expedient solution - with no fundamental changes, and his explanations as to when and why the Bud dha image was first created are often repeated or adopted by many scholars, with or without recogni tion. Coomaraswamy thus continues to cast a long shadow on our understanding of the problem. His ideas regarding the issue are mainly known through his article published in The Art Bulletin in 1927 with the very title "The Origin of the Buddha Image." Although one or two other writings are occasionally cited, this article has been widely regarded as his definitive work on the issue. However, before this article appeared, his ideas had evolved through two decades, as manifested in a series of writings from the period, and he further elaborated them afterwards. The evolution of his ideas also naturally coincided with his internal growth as a scholar. That evolution was, at the same time, part of a colonial intellectual's lifelong quest to recover national pride, as an antithesis to the orientalist outlook of his European contemporaries. With that in mind, I propose to unravel his ideas on the issue, approaching his thinking as a dynamic process rather than viewing it as epitomized in a single docu ment. This, it is hoped, will expand our sense of the basic premises and conceptions underlying his ideas and thus provide vital clues for our further explorations beyond his enterprise.1 An examination of Coomaraswamy's writings on the issue reveals that they unfolded in four phases (see the appendix at the end of this article). Understandably, each phase is not neatly delineated by a beginning and an end, but representative works of each phase clearly show a tendency of remarkable consistency. The discussions below will chronologically follow the unfolding of these four phases. There is no scholarly work that specifically discusses Coomaraswamy's scholarship on the origin of the Buddha image. Several works comment on his achievements on the issue but mostly in praise without any critical spirit. See . M. Bhattacharyya, "Coomaraswamy and Indian Religious History" and . K. Ganbuli, "Coomaraswamy and Indian Phi losophy," both in Ananda Coomaraswamy: A Centenary Volume, ed. K.M.

His accomplishment on this occasion was described by his friend O. C. Gangoly: "Coomaraswamy took the world of Indologists by storm by reading a bril liant exposition on the nature of Gandh?ra art."3 In 1952, Gangoly once again recalled "his challeng ing paper read... at Copenhagen (August 1908) in which he courageously and ably refuted the theory of Greek Influence on Indian Art, creating a great sensation among the coteries of European Archae ologists."4 What we read in the published version of his paper in Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (1908) demon strates that his ideas would have been received as quite challenging suggestions, for the Gandh?ran origin of the Buddha image as well as the Greek influence on the matter was by then admitted as hardly questionable truth. The general attitude of European scholars, who dominated contemporary acade mia, is epitomized in Albert Griinwedel's pioneering work in Indian Buddhist art scholarship, Bud dhist Art in India (1901): The ability to create an ideal type was lacking... there was no desire to create an ideal type... the ideal type of Buddha - which spiritualized the simple monk's figure, and, notwithstanding the want of ornament, stood out from all else, - was created for Buddhist art by foreigners.5 Opposing Griinwedel's view, Coomaraswamy claims that the Greek influence on Indian art, particu larly in Indian figurai sculpture - best represented by the ideal type of the Buddha - was unjustifiably exaggerated because of the prejudiced view of European scholars that Classical Greece was naturally the source of all art. He argues that the Greek tradition had little in common in terms of ideals and over all conception with the Indian tradition, which he describes as essentially transcendental. The unbridge able difference between the two was not properly understood, primarily because Indian art was stud ied mostly by "archaeologists," by which was meant, we can sense instantly, European archaeologists, while such aesthetic problems can be properly treated only by artists, who can be more perceptive: No artist, familiar with the true genius of Indian art, could suppose that the work of the Gand h?ra school [which he describes as effeminate and artistically unimportant] was the real founda tion of Indian figure sculpture, or that Indian art could have been founded on such a decadent Greeko-Roman basis.6 2 This paper was included as an appendix in his Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (Broad Campden: Essex House Press, 1908), 256-61. 3 Mohan, Ananda K.

Gibson (Lon don: Bernard Quaritch, 1901), 67-68. 6 Coomaraswamy, Medieval Sinhalese Art, 1^6. 152</page><page sequence="3">Coomaraswamy points out the probability of the presence of images, and Buddha images, before the Gandh?ra period, citing textual references to images from such sources as the Mah?bh?ratay R?m?yana, and Divy?vad?na, and defends the absence of tangible evidence as merely due to the fact that most early images were made of precious metals or impermanent materials. His claim is significant enough in its challenge to the conventional assessment in an atmosphere where the notion of the superiority of the European classical tradition was still predominant in visual art. But it is not clear whether it raised much sympathy among serious specialists other than a small number of artists and art critics who shared a romantic vision of Indian civilization, such as Ernest B. Havell. However, this was a huge break from his previous ideas, which were expressed in a review of the English edition of Buddhist Art in India by Gr?nwedel and in an article titled "Some Survivals of Sin halese Art," both published in 1906. His remarks in the latter read: The first figures of Buddha appear in the Gandh?ra sculptures (by artists of what is known as the Greco-Buddhist school) in the extreme north-west India_they show clean [sic] traces of Greek, Roman, and even Christian influence. "The ideal type of Buddha created for Buddhist art by for eigners."... These Gandh?ra types were the foundation of all later representations of Buddha, whether in Burma, China, or Ceylon.7 The remarkable conversion in his thinking thus took place between 1906 and 1908. His growing nationalist enlightenment in this period could have been one of the reasons. Having witnessed the sig nificant decline of traditional culture and the backwardness of the society in Ceylon while living there for several years, he founded the Ceylon Social Reform Society along with several Europeans in 1905 and actively engaged in writing articles and delivering lectures on the preservation of traditional cul ture and social reform.8 This experience probably enhanced his consciousness of the Indian cultural heritage and its essential distinction from the European Classical tradition. In the deepening of his knowledge of Indian art, he may have found it humiliating to simply admit the then dominant the ory of the Gandh?ran origin of the Buddha image. Another impetus probably came during Coomaraswamy's extensive travels in India in 1907 when he made friends in Calcutta with a group of artists, among them E.B. Havell and Abanindranath Tagore, who were envisioning the revival of traditional Indian art.9 The fact that Havell expressed sim ilar ideas about the origin of the Buddha image in his book Indian Sculpture and Painting (1908) leads me to suspect that a considerable exchange of ideas took place between them.10 And Havell too empha 7 A. .

Another notable source of Coomaraswamy's inspiration must have been the Japanese aesthetician Okakura Kakuzo. In his Ideals of the East (1904), Okakura had already remarked on the presence of pre-Gandh?ran images in imper manent materials on the basis of literary evidence, and this was directly cited by Coomaraswamy in his 1908 paper delivered in Copenhagen.11 As Coomaraswamy obviously had not met Okakura by this time, he most likely became acquainted with Okakura's work during his stay with the Calcutta group, which maintained a close comradeship with Okakura.12 In The Arts and Crafts of India and Ceylon (1913), Coomaraswamy's first comprehensive history of Indian art, similar ideas on the origin of the Buddha image were repeated.13 Again, he argued that prior to the emergence of Buddha images in Gandh?ra, India saw divine images being made in imperma nent materials. Around this time, Coomaraswamy's nationalist sentiments were growing even stronger. In the fall of 1907, Coomaraswamy returned to England, but he traveled again to India many times and spent extended periods there. He enthusiastically participated in the Swadeshi movement against foreign imports, which began as a protest against the division of Bengal in 1905 and continued through 1911. When the Indian colonial government decided to move its capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912, he asserted that Indian architects and craftsmen must be allowed to join the construction of the new cap ital.14 In these circumstances, for Coomaraswamy, the origin of the Buddha image seems not merely to have been a scholarly concern but to have held a considerable political significance as well. Ill Until the 1910s, Coomaraswamy's knowledge of Buddhism was fairly limited. The only book on Bud dhism he cited in his 1908 article was an elementary work called A Manual of Buddhism by Robert Spence Hardy published in 1853.15 By the time Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism was published in 1916, however, his knowledge of Buddhism had expanded improved. Although much of the information was still derived from secondary works, it was apparent that he was better prepared to approach the origin of the Buddha image from the Buddhist side as well. The treatment of the problem is found in 11 Okakura Kakuzo, The Ideals of the East, with special reference to the Art of Japan (London: John Murray, 1904), 74-76. 12 It is not clear whether Coomaraswamy ever met Okakura, who died in 1913. A letter from Okakura to Coomaraswamy dated 25 January 1911 (Coomaraswamy Papers, Princeton University library) makes it clear that they had not yet met by that time. For the close relationship between Okakura and the artists of the Calcutta group such as Rabindranath and Abanindranath Tagore, see Rustom Bharucha, Another Asia: Rabindranath agore and Okakura Tenshin (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006). 13 A. K. Coomaraswamy, The Arts and Crafts of India and Ceylon (London and Edinburgh: . N. Foulis, 1913), 47-63. 14 Lipsey, Coomaraswamy, 76-93. 15 In 1913, Coomaraswamy coauthored with Sister Nivedita his first book on Buddhism, The Myths of the Hindus and Bud dhists (London: G. G. Harrap&amp;Co.). He was responsible for about two-thirds of the volume, which includes a section on Buddhism (pp. 245-85). Since it concerns only the legendary life of the Buddha, the book does not involve a pro found knowledge of Buddhism. Coomaraswamy's father was a Hindu, and he became a Hindu himself during his trip to India in 1907 (Lipsey, Coomaraswamy, 31). But one can sense in many of his writings that he had great sympathy for Buddhism. 154</page><page sequence="5">the section "Sculpture and Painting,"16 but similar remarks appeared with more details in a separate article titled "Buddhist Primitives," published in the same year.17 My account of his more advanced ideas at this stage is based on this article. In this work, Coomaraswamy attempts for the first time to explain the origin of the Buddha image in the context of Buddhist history.18 According to him, the early Buddhist view of art was strictly hedo nistic. It is only in the third and second centuries CE that we find the Buddhists patronizing crafts men and employing art in the illustration of edifying legends, particularly stories of the former lives of the Buddha and of his last incarnation. The absence of the Buddha figure from the world of living men, i.e. in anthropomorphic form, is a true artistic rendering of the Buddha's guarded silence respect ing the after-death state of those who have attained nirvana. This convention was broken due to an emotional development akin to that which finds expression in the bhakti doctrine of the BhagavadG?t?. Even before the Buddha figure was represented in official Buddhist art, the Buddha had become an object of adoration, a very personal god; and it cannot surprise us that the Buddha figure should soon appear wherever Buddhist piety erected shrines and monuments. Asserting that images of Hindu gods were already in use in the second century BCE, Coomaraswamy judged that it was highly probable that Buddha images had been in similar private use long before they took their place in a public cult. It was in the main a later Mah?y?na and Vaisnava achievement of the Indian lyric spirit to discover that the two worlds of spiritual purity and sensuous delight need not, and perhaps ultimately cannot, be divided. In this last remark, Coomaraswamy implies that the development of Mah?y?na had an important bearing on the origin of the Buddha image. A number of points in his arguments - summed up in such keywords as nirvana, bhakti, and Ma h?y?na - are still commonly encountered in scholarly discourses of recent years without much change. Not all of these, however, were his own inventions. Relating the absence of the Buddha image to the Buddha's nirvana was probably a common explanation at the time, since it was already criticized by Gr?nwedel in his 1901 book in the following words : "The doctrine of Buddha's Nirv?na can hardly be taken as affording the reason for the fact that on the reliefs of Bar?hat, Gay?, and S?nch? the Buddha does not appear. The doctrine of Nirv?na, in its present canonical form, was probably not developed at all at that time."19 The rise of Mah?y?na has also often been noted as coinciding with the emergence of the Buddha image. Coomaraswamy's original contribution would be to connect bhakti to the ori gin of the Buddha image, and he deserves credit for intricately correlating these three factors in his explanation. Coomaraswamy maintained his argument that earlier images had existed in impermanent mate rials : " the figures of the seated Buddha, if not the standing types, probably came into use as cult objects a good deal earlier, perhaps in the second century . C. ; if these were generally made in wood or imper 6 A. . Coomaraswamy, Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism (London: Harper, and New York: Putnam, 1916), 323-32. 17 A. K.

"20 One of the reasons for this was that the origin of Buddha images in Gandh?ra was still believed at the time, on the authority of Alfred Foucher, the champion of Gand h?ran art scholarship, to lie in the first to second century CE, whereas no extant example from India proper could compete with them in date. In the remark just cited, Coomaraswamy specifically speaks of seated Buddhas, not standing Bud dhas, as the earliest creation among Buddha images. This is because he believed that seated Buddha images had their iconographie origin nowhere else but in the yoga posture of Indian indigenous reli gious tradition: Long before the Buddha image became a cult object, the familiar form of the seated yogi must have presented itself to the Indian mind... ; when the development of imagery followed there was no other form which could have been made a universally recognized symbol of Him-who-had-thus attained.21 Likewise, many other important iconographie elements such as mudr?s were also derived from the Indian tradition. This argument implies that referring to the "Greek Origin" for the Buddha image is hardly acceptable on iconographie grounds. Coomaraswamy continued the same line of argument in a short review written in 1919 on The Begin nings of Buddhist Art (1917) by Foucher, the major proponent of the Gandh?ran origin of the Buddha image.22 Foucher's book is a compilation of nine essays that appeared earlier and include one titled "The Beginnings of Buddhist Art" and another with the provocative title "The Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha," to which Coomaraswamy's criticism in the review was mainly directed.23 Foucher's arguments on the issue were not actually as heavily prejudiced as they might now seem. We might say in his defense that he made efforts to draw what he felt was the most plausible and most bal anced conclusion based on the available material evidence, as is shown in his concluding remarks in "The Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha": It was recently still the custom to triumph noisily over the artistic inferiority of the Indians, reduced to accepting ready made from the hands of others the concrete realization of their own religious ideal. At present, owing to aesthetic bias or to nationalist rancour, it is the fashion to make the school of Gandh?ra pay for its manifest superiority by a systematic blackening of its noblest pro duction. We for our part refuse in this connection to share either the unjustifiable contempt of the old criticism for native inspiration or the ill-disguised spite of the new against the foreign make.24 20 Coomaraswamy, "Buddhist Primitives," 89. 21 Ibid., 50-51. 22 Alfred Foucher, The Beginnings of Buddhist Art, and Other Essays in Indian and Central-Asian Archaeology, trans.

He also easily rejected images from Mathur? or Amar?vat? as candidates for the earliest images of the Buddha, regarding them as derivatives from "a common ancestor of blue slate and native to the north-western corner of India," which no doubt meant the Gandh?ran tradi tion, while presuming without any corroboration the presence of Buddha images in Gandh?ra even before the extant examples.25 Coomaraswamy's counterarguments were conveyed in a remarkably restrained manner. But it is notable that as a major proponent of the "Indian origin," Coomaraswamy perceived himself by this time as an antagonist to Foucher. This is already seen in his 1916 book and essay, in which he denounced the French edition (1913) of "The Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha" and the first volume oiUArt gr?co-bouddhique du Gand h?ra (1905), both by Foucher. Coomaraswamy's persistent criticism of Foucher continued in his review (1924) of the second volume of L'Art gr?co-bouddhique du Gandh?ra (published in two separate parts in 1918 and 1922) and every other work from the 1920s that treated the origin of the Buddha image. Beyond scholarly dissensions on the issue, Coomaraswamy's vigilant awareness of the different backgrounds between a colonial and a European colonialist may have prompted, at least partially, his unremitting criticism towards Foucher. The two were also from quite different scholarly backgrounds. Foucher, the older of the two by twelve years and an eminent Sanskritist and archaeologist, was a central figure in the mainstream oriental studies circle in Europe.26 Reflecting a distinctive trend among French aca demics, his scholarship was conspicuously positivistic, and his specialty, iconographical studies, can exhibit a dryness associated with archaeological discourse in its most problematic form. Like that of most specialists on Asia in his time, his scholarship had its basis in Western Classical studies, and he was in every sense of the word an orientalist who saw India as the Other. In contrast, Coomaraswamy, who started serious study of Indian civilization as late as the end of his twenties, always showed more interest in interpretation than in positivistic research. As is well known, in his formation as a schol arly intellectual, he was greatly influenced by William Blake, the romanticism of Nietzsche, the moral ism of John Ruskin, and the Arts and Crafts Movement of William Morris.27 Against this background, he was increasingly attracted to European medieval civilization, which he equated with civilizations in Asia.28 He lauded the traditional society and culture of Asia, but detested its present. In this sense, he shared a great deal in common with romantic orientalists of Europe. As early as 1908, in his essay "The Influence of Greek on Indian Art," he distinguished his viewpoint from that of archaeologists, with whom he must have identified such European scholars as Alexander Cunningham, James Fer 25 In an excellent post-colonialist reflection on Gandh?ran art scholarship by early European scholars, Stanley Abe treats the significance of discourses by Foucher and Coomaraswamy on the origin of the Buddha image, citing the passage from Foucher's Beginnings of Buddhist Art noted above.

The inten tion of the above-mentioned works is quite laudable, but unfortunately they all fall into the error of trying to interpret works of art only on the basis of expression.30 Despite Bachhofer's succinct dismissal, however, Coomaraswamy embarked during the 1920s on more serious academic research on Indian art, producing more significant writings on the origin of the Bud dha image, which marked yet another stage in his pursuit of the issue. IV In 1917, Coomaraswamy moved to America and began to work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, as its curator of Indian and Islamic art.31 In his first professional job as a specialist in Indian art, he enthu siastically devoted himself to his work and benefited greatly from the practical experience of handling actual art objects, thus improving the positivistic side of his scholarship. The review of Foucher's Beginnings of Buddhist Art, written two years after his arrival in Boston, had not yet exhibited any marked difference from the preceding phase, but Introduction to Indian Art, published in 1923, demon strates a new stage of his exploration.32 Although it has not received due attention among his writ ings, it is highly significant as it reveals already intact the basic framework that his much better known History of Indian and Indonesian Art would take four years later. Coomaraswamy writes in this work, "The explanation of the absence of the human Buddha figure from the historical scenes appears to lie, not in any inability to represent the Master in an appropriate manner, but in the existence of an already familiar method of indicating the Great Events of the Bud dha's life by means of symbols."33 In a way this remark is not fundamentally different from Foucher's in The Beginnings of Buddhist Art: "A tree, a wheel, a stupa, these suffice to recall to our memory the spectacle of those holy places, or even, by a constant association of ideas and images, to evoke the mir acles of which they had been the theatre."34 However, Coomaraswamy speaks of symbols in a much more positive sense, while Foucher further argues that an "evolution" had occurred with the intro 29 Mitter divides the early-twentieth-century scholars of Indian art into two groups : the archaeologist group and the transcendental group, and classifies Henry Cole and J. Fergusson in the former and Havell and Coomaraswamy in the latter.

Coomaraswamy continues, "as regards the separate images, it is evident that the apotheosis of the Buddha had not yet, at least in orthodox circles, proceeded so far as to necessitate the use of an icon." Thus, apotheosis was achieved through "the rise of theistic cults, with their doctrine and practice of devotion (bhakti)" which immediately determined the development of a religious art, or a religious art with an icon. This relates to a transformation of Buddhism with the rise of Mah?y?na.35 These arguments do not essen tially differ from those in his 1916 article. More remarkable is that rather than simply refuting or rejecting the Greek origin or the Gand h?ran origin of the Buddha image, he vigorously argues for the Indian origin.36 He points out that, while there do not exist, either in Gandh?ra or in India proper, Buddha images known to be earlier than the first century CE, Foucher's observation that the earliest extant Gandh?ran images were "already stereotyped"37 indicates that Buddha images must have been present as early as the first cen tury CE. Coomaraswamy then questions whether the prototypes were of Greek or Indian origin. Emerging here as critical evidence in Coomaraswamy's arguments are Buddhist images from Kus?na Mathur?. Having been vigorously excavated and brought into the museum collection since the late nineteenth century, these Mathur? images became widely known through the efforts of Jean Philippe Vogel, a Dutch Indologist who worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in a series of his excavation reports published in the ASI Annual Report and his catalogue of the Mathur? Museum, first published in 1910.38 The deciphering of the inscriptions on the images dated in the Kaniska era by epigraphists such as Heinrich L?ders placed them securely in the first to second cen tury CE. Coomaraswamy seems to have become familiar with these materials by the 1920s.39 In pre senting Mathur? images in comparison with Gandh?ran images, he debated the relative plausibility of the theories of the Greek origin and the Mathur? origin. He summed up the arguments for the two theories as follows:40 35 Coomaraswamy, Introduction to Indian Art, 33, 35. 36 Ibid., 35-38. 37 The phrase " already stereotyped " (d?j? st?r?otyp?) was originally used by Foucher in his characterization of the Kaniska reliquary; he was thus trying to date back the origin of Gandh?ran Buddhas much earlier to the first century BCE. Foucher, "The Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha," 130. Coomaraswamy frequently used this phrase for his arguments since "Buddhist Primitives" and Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism. It is interesting that he had faithfully adopted Foucher's argument in support of his claim for the Indian, not Gandh?ran, origin of the Buddha image in the first century BCE. 38 Jean Philippe Vogel, "The Mathur?

They are listed again in the bibliography of History of Indian and Indonesian Art with many more works that treat Mathur?. 40 Coomaraswamy, Introduction to Indian Art, 37-38. Each argument in the following is in Coomaraswamy's own words with only slight modifications. 159</page><page sequence="10">For the Greek origin: 1) Buddhist figures in Gandh?ra are adaptations of Western type, whereas early Indian religious art makes use of primal symbols without anthropomorphic icons. 2) Formulae of Hellenistic art are adopted to a greater or lesser extent in India proper, and can be rec ognized in Indian art over several centuries. 3 ) As no Indian Buddha figures older than the Gandh?ra sculptures are known for certain, it is at least possible that the first Buddha images were made in Gandh?ra, and formed the models of later Indian Buddhist art. For the Indian origin: 1) The purely Indian attitudes of the Gandh?ran figures, the use of the lotus seat, often awkwardly represented, the characteristically realistic transformation of the usntsa would seem to imply the existence of purely Indian prototypes. 2) Bodhisattva and Buddha figures of the first century CE do actually occur at Mathur? too, in a style quite distinct from that of Gandh?ra, and plainly developed from earlier Indian art. 3) Negative evidence holds good as much in one sense as the other, particularly in a period of still uncertain chronology. 4) No Western prototype for a seated figure with crossed legs and hands in dhy?na or bh?misparsa mudr? can be cited or imagined. 5) Regarded simply as works of art, there is no suggestion of primitive inspiration in Gandh?ran sculpture. The arguments for the Indian origin are essentially the same as those he would use in his later History of Indian and Indonesian Art in a more expanded and elaborated form. Of them, arguments 1 and 4 sup porting the Indian origin may be valid only rhetorically, for the images implied in the arguments were more likely mental images, not actual images. Still, Coomaraswamy concludes, "it may be regarded both as a priori likely and as historically possible, that the Buddha image wherever found is based on Indian prototypes." Coomaraswamy's unremitting pursuit continued in the publication of "The Invention of the Bud dha Figure" in 1924 and "The Indian Origin of the Buddha Image" in 1926.41 The former was a review of the second volume of L'Art gr?co-bouddhique du Gandh?ra by Foucher, completed in 1922. Again, he repeats that the creation of the Buddha image outside India proper is not likely because Gandh?ran Buddhas are iconographically grounded in the Indian tradition. He also speaks of bhakti but this time supports his argument by citing the German Indologist Hermann Jacobi, who claimed that the apoth eosis of Buddha in Buddhism and of Mah?vira in Jainism stems from bhakti'. 41 A.K. Coomaraswamy, " The Invention of the Buddha Figure," Ostasiatische Zeitschrift 9 ( 1924) : 51- 55 ; and " The Indian Origin of the Buddha Image "Journal of the American Oriental Society 46 (1926): 165-70. 6</page><page sequence="11">[Image worship] did not originate with the monks, but with the lay community, when the peo ple in general felt the want of a higher cult than that of their rude deities and demons, and when the religious development of India found in the Bhakti the supreme means of salvation.42 This is the first time that he cited Jacobi's work, but it is possible that his remarks on bhakti in previ ous works were also inspired by Jacobi. Coomaraswamy's "The Indian Origin of the Buddha" was apparently a byproduct of his research for History of Indian and Indonesian Art. This simply cited diverse comments by other scholars, which he classified into the following five groups: ) date of the Greco-Buddhist school of Gandh?ra 2) date of the Mathur? type 3 ) independence of the Mathur? type 4) Mathur? as the center of type-distribution in India 5) the Gandh?ran type having no profound affect on Indian art. A notable change is that he takes up the chronological problem of Gandh?ran and Mathur? images. By this time, it had become apparent to many that the origin of Buddha images in Gandh?ra did not date back as early as Foucher's supposition, and this made Coomaraswamy realize that images from Mathur? were no later than those from Gandh?ra, an estimation expressed earlier by Victor Goloubew in his critique of Foucher's L'Art gr?co-bouddhique du Gandh?ra and supported by the excavation results from Taxila reported by John H. Marshall.43 Citing the opinions of such scholars as Goloubew, Vogel, and Marshall, Coomaraswamy suggests that the examples from Gandh?ra and Mathur? are indepen dent creations and that the latter may even predate the former. He sums up his point in the following words: The Gandh?ra and Mathur? types were created by the internal development of the Buddhism com mon to both areas;... in each area the sculptors, following similar literary and oral traditions in respect of iconography, created a type plastically in accordance with stylistic traditions of their own_44 42 Hermann Jacobijaina Sutras, part , Sacred Books of the East, vol. 22 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1884), xxii. 43 Goloubew's review was published in Bulletin de ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient for the year 1922 ( 1923 ) : 438-54, espe cially 450: "Rien n'emp?che en effet, dans l'?tat present de nos connaissances, de supposer que le buddha indo-grec du Gandh?ra soit une creation post?rieur de quelques ann?es au buddha indien de Mathur?. " Marshall's remark is cited from A Guide to Taxila (Calcutta: Govt. Printing, 1918), 31: "Not one of the thousands of known images bears a date in any known era, nor do considerations of style permit us to determine their chronological sequence with any approach to accuracy. " Also notable is Vogel's assessment in "Inscribed Gandh?ra Sculpture," ASlAR ?-04 (dated 1905): 258: "It is a point on which most authorities agree, that the palmy days of Buddhism and Buddhist art in Gandh?ra coincide with the reign of the great Kus?na kings, and more especially with that of Kaniska. This is some what more than a hypothesis." 44 Coomaraswamy, "Indian Origin of the Buddha Image," 165. 6</page><page sequence="12">Coomaraswamy's resolute quest for the origin of the Buddha image reached a climax in History of Indian and Indonesian Art and "The Origin of the Buddha Image," both published in 1927.45 Since the preface of the former is dated to May 1926, it may have been written slightly earlier. As mentioned above, the main arguments in the two works are basically identical to those in Intro duction to Indian Art (1923). A new, noteworthy argument is that styles of art developed as the result of changes in racial psychology; this line of reasoning was adopted from the ideas of Josef Strzygowski, an eminent art historian of the Vienna school.46 What most attracted Coomaraswamy's attention among Strzygowski's ideas was that essential differences existed between the artistic expressions of the northern and southern races and that these differences stem from psychological distinctions between the two racial types. Greatly inspired by Strzygowski, Coomaraswamy argued that Aryans, a northern race, tended toward abstract symbolism, while Dravidians, a southern race, exhibited an extensive and deep-rooted system of popular cults and a decided tendency to employ anthropomor phic iconography: Indeed, if we recognize in the Dravidians a southern race, and in the Aryans a northern, it may well be argued that the victory of kingly over tribal organisations, the gradual reception into orthodox religion of the phallus cult and mother-goddesses, and the shift from abstract symbolism to anthro pomorphic iconography in the period of theistic and bhakti development, mark a final victory of the conquered over the conquerors.47 Thus, he relates the racial theory to his old claim regarding the role of bhakti and uses it to explain the earlier presence of aniconism and the later emergence of Buddha images. He says that what we see tak ing place in Indian art toward the beginning of the Common Era is not so much the creation of a brand new iconography - inspired by the Western Classical tradition in the northwestern region - as the adaptation of an older iconography to new requirements, and the giving of a new and deeper content to time-honored forms.48 45 A. .

He cites the following works by Strzygowski : Ori ent oder Rom (Leipzig, 1901); Altai-Iran und V?lenwanderung (Leipzig, 1917); Origins of Christian Church Art (Oxford, 1923); and "Perso-Indian Landscape in Northern Art," in The Influences of Indian Art (London, 1925). Coomaraswamy's interest in the racial theory is already seen in his 1924 review of the second volume of Foucher's L'Art gr?co-bouddhique du Gandh?ra ("The Invention of the Buddha Figure," 54): "M. Foucher, accustomed to the modern world in which the individual counts for so much, perhaps forgets that in the ancient world, with rare exceptions, and in Asia up to the modern times, it has been the race and not the individual that has expressed itself in art." 47 Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art,'). 48 Ibid., 46-47. 6</page><page sequence="13">A comparative art historian who treated vast regional traditions, including ancient Nordic, Iran ian, Russian, and Indian cultures, Strzygowski was an influential figure much admired in America and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s.49 His particular fondness for non-Mediterranean traditions includ ing that of India probably drew Coomaraswamy's attention. Coomaraswamy cited Strzygowski in many other works, revealing great enthusiasm for his ideas.50 However, Strzygowski's racial determin ism, accompanied not surprisingly by a sympathy for German National Socialism, were heavily crit icized by later scholars.51 Racial theory, especially one that makes binary categories, often implicates the problem of hierarchy by its corollary, and is easily prone to political exploitation, as history has shown. Today, awareness of the dangers of racial ideology might create an instant challenge to such a theory in serious scholarly discourse.52 In Indian art scholarship, however, racial theory has often been - and still is - treated as a useful mode of explanation, especially convenient in such problems as the origin of the Buddha image.53 In History of Indian and Indonesian Art, Coomaraswamy focuses on actual extant images instead of hypothetical ones made of impermanent materials. He concerns himself mainly with estimating the historical precedence between images of Gandh?ra and Mathur?. Thus, he discusses actual images in great detail, obviously on the basis of his newly acquired museum experience over the previous ten years in Boston. He concludes his discussions with the followings words: The only possible conclusion is that the Buddha figure must have been produced simultaneously, probably in the middle of or near the beginning of the first century A. D., in Gandh?ra and Math ur?, in response to a demand created by the internal development of the Buddha which was com mon ground in both areas; in each case by local craftsmen, working in the local tradition.54 49 Udo Kultermann, The History of Art History (New York: Abaris Books, 1993), 163-65; W.

It is possible that Coomaraswamy attended the lecture, but there is no evidence that they ever met. Strzygowski is mentioned nowhere in any biographical literature on Coomaraswamy. 51 W.

Having arrived in Calcutta in 1921, Kram risch was active as a key member of the Indian Society of Oriental Art and also taught at the University of Calcutta until 1950. Coomaraswamy most likely met her in Calcutta as early as the 1920s. But it is not clear whether Coomara swamy knew Kramrisch's 1924 article, which was not listed in the bibliography of History of Indian and Indonesian Art. As regards questions about the binary categorization of Aryans and non-?ryans, see Romilar Thapar, "Which of Us Are Aryans?" Seminar 364 (Dec. 1989): 14-18. 54 Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art, 60. 63</page><page sequence="14">"The Origin of the Buddha Image," published in 1927, is one of the best known works by Coomara swamy and considered among his most important contributions. While stating a need for the work, he criticizes Foucher: M. Foucher, the author most committed to the Greek theory, did not hesitate to suggest in his genial way that in the case of European students, these doubts [against the Greek origin] were only the result of aesthetic prejudice, in the case of Indian students, of nationalist rancour.55 Obviously, Coomaraswamy has in mind Foucher's words from his "The Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha" cited above.56 As Foucher implied in that somewhat arrogant statement, Coomaraswamy considers "aesthetic bias" and "nationalist rancour" as criticisms directed at Europeans and Indians respectively who do not agree with the Greek origin. His response to Foucher is quite emotional yet unrelenting: In scientific writings, references to the nationality of those who do not or may not agree with us are not always in the best of taste; not all of M. Foucher's eloquence can make them gracious, and in any case they are no good substitute for reasoned argument.57 He immediately adds that Indian (and Japanese) scholars showed a singular humility, and perhaps some timidity, in their ready acceptance of all the results of European scholarship, while most of those who expressed doubts regarding the Foucher theory were Europeans such as Havell, Cohn, Laufer, Goloubew, Sir?n, and Kramrisch. Convinced that "nationalist rancour" was directed toward him, he does not hesitate to disclose his resolution to conclude the controversy with his article. Coomaraswamy states that the purpose of his work is to outline the evidence for the Indian origin of the Buddha image in particular and for that image's Indian iconography in general. Although he still retains the phrase "Indian origin," his discussions overall are restrained - significantly more sub dued than his response to Foucher, which we have just seen - and his points argued in a more objec tive manner. They proceed in six sections beginning with "What is the Buddha Image?" The argu ments are essentially the same as in his previous writings, but with much more elaborate details; long footnotes reveal a more positivistic style to which he had become accustomed since his arrival in Amer ica. The second section, "The Early Representation of Deities by Means of Symbols," discusses a dis tinction between the northern (Aryan, symbolic) and the southern (Dravidian, anthropomorphic) modes of representing divinities, and the third section, "The Necessity for a Buddha Image," presents bhakti as a generating force in the creation of the Buddha image. The fourth section, "Elements of the Later Anthropomorphic Iconography Already Present in Early Indian Art," clarifies that various icono graphie elements of Buddha images such as the yoga posture, usnlsa, urna, and curly hair as well as those of Bodhisattva images were derived from the Indian tradition, of which the earliest examples must have existed in precious metals or impermanent materials during the second and third centuries 55 Coomaraswamy, "The Origin of the Buddha Image, " 287-88. 56 See n. 24 above. 57 Coomaraswamy, "The Origin of the Buddha Image, " 288, n. 1. 164</page><page sequence="15">BCE. The fifth section, "Style and Content : Differentiation of Indian and Hellenistic Types," confirms the mutual independence of the Indian type and the Hellenistic type of Gandh?ra. He concludes the last section, "Dating of Gandh?ra and Mathur? Buddhas," with the following words: The balance of real evidence tends to show that the Buddha figure came into general use somewhat before the beginning of the reign of Kaniska, and not more than fifty years at most, if so much, before his accession. The evidence is not sufficiently precise to warrant us in forming a theory as to the priority of either school. I am inclined to presume on general grounds a priority for Math ur?; but that is not evidence. All that we can assert is that the earliest Buddha types in each area are in the local style; and that later on, though some mutual influence was felt, the outstanding character of the development is one of stylistic Indianization in Gandh?ra, and one of adherence to the Mathur? type in the Ganges valley, subject to the normal stylistic evolution which marks the transition from Kus?na to Gupta types.58 VI Coomaraswamy's life in America was relatively comfortable, and his position in the museum was secure. With his distinctive viewpoint and scholarship, he made considerable contributions to the field of art history in America, which was about to burgeon during the 1920s and 1930s. He earned international fame as well. While he was devoted to art historical studies in the 1920s, his interest conspicuously shifted at the end of the decade to the metaphysical and religious interpretations of art.59 On the basis of newly acquired or strengthened philological knowledge in P?li, Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, his work was increasingly dedicated to what he called iconographical studies. He seems to have considered his 1927 article a definitive statement on the origin of the Buddha image. I find no more writings that treat the issue in a contentious spirit, but his concern with Buddha images continued in a different form. In Elements of Buddhist Iconography, published in 1935, Coomaraswamy makes short remarks on the problem. Although he had noted in his 1927 article that no interdiction against making a Buddha image could be found in Buddhist literature,60 he draws attention in this 1935 book to an account in the P?li canon: "the K?lingabodhi J?taka, in the Introduction, enunciates what amounts to such a pro hibition, and may well have been the point of view current in Buddhist circles at a much earlier date than can be positively asserted for the J?taka text. "6l According to this j?taka, there are three kinds of cetiyas (or "hallows" in Coomaraswamy's words): s?rtraka (hallows of body), p?ribhogaka (hallows of 58 Ibid., 323-24. In this article, Coomaraswamy follows the theory of dating Kaniska's accession to 120 CE. Thus, the dates he is referring to here are later than those in History of Indian and Indonesian Art, where he dates Kaniska's acces sion to 78 CE. 59 In this period, what has been characterized as a "philosophical" or "mystical" approach (Donald M. Stadtner, "New Approaches to South Asian Art," ArtJournal 49 [Winter 1990] : 359) became increasingly prominent in Coomaraswamy's scholarship. 60 Coomaraswamy, "The Origin of the Buddha Image, " 294. 61 A. K. Coomaraswamy, Elements of Buddhist Iconography (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1935), 4-6. For thisjataka, see V. Fausb0ll, ed., The J?taka, vol. 4 (London: Tr?bner &amp; Co., 1887), 228; and the English translation: E. B. Cowell, trans., The J?taka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births, vol. 4 (Cambridge: University Press, 1901), 65</page><page sequence="16">association), and uddesika (hallows prescribed). Of the three, the Buddha rejected s?r?raka and udde sika because s?r?raka can only be venerated after the Buddha's parinibb?na (parinirv?na) and uddesika is "groundless and merely fanciful." Thus onlyp?ribhogaka such as the bodhi tree was allowed as a hal low. Coomaraswamy identifies uddesika as anthropomorphic images and supports this with the account from the Khuddhakap?tha-Atthakath?, in which uddisska-cetiyam is equated with buddha-patima, "an image of the Buddha," while p?ribhogaka can include further "such aniconic representations as the wheel (cakra), feet (p?duka), tris?la (nandi-pada), and/or other geometrical, vegetative, or even the riomorphic forms actually met with in early Buddhist art." Thus, he understands this passage as jus tifying the ancient custom of using predominantly aniconic imagery prior to the emergence of Bud dha images.62 Coomaraswamy advanced these ideas in "The Nature of Buddhist Art,"63 his introduction to The Wall Paintings of India, Central Asia, and Ceylon (1938) by Benjamin Rowland. In this sophisticated and somewhat discursive essay, Coomaraswamy declares, "the central problem of Buddhist art, of which a solution is essential to any real understanding, is not a problem of styles, but of how it came about that the Buddha has been represented at all in an anthropomorphic form."64 He seeks an answer to this question in the presence of what he identifies as two distinct, prominent concepts in ancient Indian religions - the eternal and the temporal - and their respective expressions in art - the abstract and the anthropomorphic. He regards our predilection for the human figure or the anthropomorphic as being inherited from late Classical cultures and relegates it to an altogether subordinate place. The emergence of anthropomorphic images of the Buddha is not a matter of spiritual progress - or of an increased profundity of vision - but merely a concession to intellectually lower levels: We must remember that an abstract art is adapted to contemplative uses and implies a gnosis; an anthropomorphic art evokes a religious emotion, and corresponds rather to prayer than to contem plation. If the development of an art can be justified as answering new needs, it must not be over looked that to speak of a want is to speak of a deficiency in him who wants: the more one is, the less one wants. We ought not, then, to think so much of a deficiency of plastic art in aniconic rit uals as of the adequacy of the purely abstract formulae and the proficiency of those who could make use of purely symbolic representations.65 142. For more detailed discussion about these three types of cetiya and their implications for image worship, see Juhyung Rhi, "Images, Relics, and Jewels: The Assimilation of Images in the Buddhist Relic Cult in Gandh?ra," Artibus Asiae 65,1(2005): 169-70. 62 Coomaraswamy, Elements of Buddhist Iconography, 4-6. 63 A. K. Coomaraswamy, vol. 1, Selected Papers, "The Nature of Buddhist Art," complied in Coomaraswamy, Traditional Art and Symbolism, ed. Roger Lipsey (Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1977), 147-78, particularly 147-64. 64 Coomaraswamy, "The Nature of Buddhist Art, " 150. 65 Ibid., 152. 66 Ibid., 159. 67 In significantly improving his knowledge of Buddhism in this period, Coomaraswamy may have greatly benefited from Japanese scholars with whom he associated, although he was not capable of reading Japanese or Chinese. 68 Coomaraswamy, "The Nature of Buddhist Art, " 164. 69 Ibid., 164, n. 27. 66</page><page sequence="17">Thus, he implies that the non-anthropomorphic symbols in early Buddhism were religiously superior to what came after. Still, he sees that what appeared as anthropomorphism in India proper was con ceptually distinct from that of the Western Classical tradition: "anthropomorphic" in the sense in which this word is appropriate to Indian images does not import " naturalistic " ; the Buddha image is not in any sense a portrait, but a symbol ; nor indeed are there any Indian images of any deity that do not proclaim by their very constitution that "this is not the likeness of a man" ; the image is devoid of any semblance of organic structure; it is not a reflection of anything that has been physically seen, but an intelligible form or formula.66 Coomaraswamy discusses these points on the grounds of Indian philosophy, Buddhism, and compar ative religions. Even though the framework of his arguments is essentially identical, he cites many more philosophical writings and his arguments are much more sophisticated, enhanced with parallels from European medieval Christian art. By now he had become fairly familiar with Indian classical texts such as the Upanisads and Br?hmanas and with Buddhist scriptures such as Divy?vad?na and Mah?y ? nas?tr?lamk?ra. He compares abstract symbols and anthropomorphic images to the dharmak?ya and sambhogak?ya from the theory of the Buddha's three bodies,67 although his understanding of Bud dhism, particularly of Mah?y?na doctrines, does not seem profound enough. The parallels he finds with European medieval traditions equate India with medieval Europe to an unjustifiable extent, reflecting his close association with Meyer Schapiro from Columbia University during the 1930s. Coomaraswamy wrote a number of essays on that subject as well. His obsessive pursuit of Mathur?'s precedence over Gandh?ra significantly diminished in this period. He backs off somewhat from his earlier claim about images in impermanent materials - although he still admits the crucial role of mental images - saying: if it is not historically true that any tangible image of the Buddha had been made before the begin ning of the Christian era, it is equally certain that an essential image not made by hands had been conceived, and even verbally stated, in terms of the thirty-two major and eighty minor peculiari ties of the "Great Person"; when the first image was to be made, there already existed the "ascer tained means of operation."68 However, citing in a note Rowland's assessment about the chronology of Gandh?ran art, he remarks: We are inclined to agree with Rowland that "Gandh?ra school came into existence shortly before the accession of Kaniska in the second century of the Common Era," thus either making the ear liest Gandh?ran images and those of Mathur? almost contemporary, or giving some priority to the latter.69 He asserts that the sculptors of Mathur? had at their command not only visual images of the "Great Person" but also the tradition of indigenous iconographie types such asyaksas and yogis, while in the collaboration between the Hellenistic artist and the Indian Buddhist patron in the creation of the Bud 167</page><page sequence="18">dha image in Gandh?ra, the Hellenistic artist performed only the servile operation and the Indian patron remained responsible for the free act of imagination. He concludes: The Buddha image came into being because a need had been felt for it, and not because a need had been felt for "art."7? Thus, once again, Coomaraswamy emphasizes the holistic nature of Buddha images as both religious and visual objects. VII By the time Coomaraswamy passed away in 1947 at the age of seventy, controversy about the origin of the Buddha image, or Greek versus Indian, or Gandh?ra versus Mathur?, had largely subsided. Although scholars continued to discuss the problem after the appearance of Coomaraswamy's 1927 arti cle "The Origin of the Buddha Image,"71 it became evident that a Greek or Gandh?ran origin could not be simply assumed. Most scholars came to accept that Buddha images in Gandh?ra and Mathur? were independent creations and that chronological differences, if any, between the two groups were negligible; this became the dominant perception in the second half of the twentieth century. I believe it would still be worthwhile to explore the precedence between the two groups, with a renewed focus on what actually happened, rather than what should have happened. Yet most scholars seem to have shied away from this matter, perhaps wary of the contentious spirit of earlier debates. This has led to the leading viewpoint, which could be regarded as a safer compromise, if not a truce, between the two positions. It is intriguing to think about how Foucher, who died in 1952, responded to Coomaraswamy's unflagging offensives as they unfolded over some two decades. Foucher must have been familiar with Coomaraswamy's writings. Since "The Origin of the Buddha Image" was treated, a year after its pub lication, in Revue des arts asiatiques, a representative journal of the French school,72 Coomaraswamy's ideas must have been well known among French scholars. Apparently, Coomaraswamy also person ally sent his writings to Foucher.73 Yet the only sign of Foucher's response in print is the brief remark on "national rancour" cited above from his "Greek Origin of the Image of the Buddha" ; even that was not explicitly directed to Coomaraswamy. Three letters from Foucher to Coomaraswamy preserved in the Coomaraswamy papers at Princeton University, dated from 1926 to 1930, indicate that the two cor responded with each other in the second half of the 1920s. In them, Foucher addresses Coomaraswamy cordially without showing any animosity, and it seems that they, at least overtly, maintained a con genial relationship. Still, Foucher's silence about Coomaraswamy's criticism may imply that he sim ply ignored it. He did not officially change his position regarding the origin of the Buddha image, and, as is well known, devoted himself to exploring Greek remains in Bactria, which he believed would provide crucial evidence for a critical role played by Bactrian Greeks in generating the Buddha image.74 As I stated at the beginning of this paper, Coomaraswamy's legacy in scholarly discourses on the origin of the Buddha image is enormous. When J.E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw wrote The "Scythian" jo Ibid., 164. 71 Henri Deydier, Contribution de ?tude de Vart du Gandh?ra (Paris: Adrien Maisonneuve, 1950), 46-64. 72 Joseph Hackin, "Arch?ologique bouddhique," Revue des arts asiatiques 5 (1928): 125-26. 68</page><page sequence="19">Period, a monumental piece in Kus?na studies, in 1949, her ideas on the origin of the Buddha image were essentially based on Coomaraswamy's.75 A major figure in the exploration of the issue in the sec ond half of the twentieth century, Lohuizen never gave up the belief that in the origin of the Buddha image, Mathur? had the initiative not only in the nature of contribution but also in chronological precedence.76 Benjamin Rowland, who derived much from Coomaraswamy during his long residence at Harvard, faithfully adopted in his discussion of the origin of the Buddha image the very keywords and arguments used by Coomaraswamy such as bhakti,yaksas, the trik?ya theory, and the K?lingabodhi j?takaJ7 More recently, during the 1980s when John and Susan Huntington took issue with anicon ism in early Indian Buddhist art, one of their major arguments was that even at the beginning of the history of Buddhism there were Buddha images made of impermanent materials.78 Coomaraswamy's ideas are indeed deeply entrenched in our scholarship on the origin of the Buddha image. And yet a number of questions remain to be fully explored. There is, for one, the question of prece dence between Gandh?ra and Mathur?. The theory of simultaneous creations in the two regions may be fair enough to each side, but it seems a wishful compromise uncorroborated by hard evidence. The complexity of this question is evident: it can boil down to a debate between colonialism and nation alism. To argue that an external cultural element was crucial in the creation of the first icon of a once prominent Indian religion would now be an awkward and risky business for any researcher, and most recent attempts on the issue of precedence have been made in favor of Mathur?. It is true that we may never know where the first Buddha image was made. We understandably cannot know if we have access to the very first image, and there is always a strong possibility that we have lost images made of impermanent materials. Significant typological differences between the images extant from the two regions, moreover, remind us of a complex relationship between them that cannot be dismissed sim ply by stating that the images are contemporary. If they had been simultaneous creations, would there have been more affinities in iconography between the two types?79 73 Foucher correspondence dated July 1929. 74 After the completion of L'Ari gr?co-bouddhique du Gandh?ra in 1922, Foucher did not change his position - although not expressed explicitly - in Etude sur l'art bouddhique de linde (Tokyo: Maison Franco-japonaise, 1928) and La vieille route de linde de Bactres ?

Narain (New Delhi: Kanak Publications, 1985), 23; cf. Susan L. Huntington, "Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism," ArtJournal49,4 (1990): 401-8. The latter, which attempts to refute the presence of the aniconic period in early Indian Buddhism, does not specifically speak of images made of impermanent materials, but is based on such a premise. 79 In one of my previous works, I pointed out that the earliest extant images from Mathur?, the so-called Kapardin type, were most likely created as representation of a bodhisattva (??kyamuni in the pre-buddhahood state) as in their appel lations in inscriptions, while the Buddha type wearing a monastic dress, which was adopted in Mathur? as a proper representation of the Buddha (the fully enlightened one), was created in Gandh?ra.

However, one wonders whether this argument has ever been scrutinized critically enough. It is quite unlikely that only anthropomorphic images, and not aniconic symbols, relate to bhakti. Coomaraswamy inter preted the shift to bhakti in Indian religions as having manifest in Buddhism through the apotheosis of the Buddha. However, does the apotheosis of the Buddha necessarily engender the worship of the Buddha image? Or does the Buddha image necessarily presuppose the apotheosis of the Buddha? Third, one even wonders whether the two markedly different types from Gandh?ra and Mathur? were indeed created for a common reason. It is doubtful that they were conceived to convey the same meaning, either as images or as what images were supposed to represent. In "The Nature of Buddhist Art," Coomaraswamy sometimes views images as inferior to aniconic symbols or sometimes regards Indian images as conceptually different from their Western counterparts. This raises a fundamental question as to the definition of an image. Early European scholars saw the problem of the origin of the Buddha through the conceptual prem ises of divine images in Western Classical traditions as well as through the controversial status of divine images in Christianity. Coomaraswamy's conceptual structure was not essentially different ; only the emphasis differed. He did not find the exclusion of images or the absence of images as something inferior or deficient but attempted to interpret the meaning of images in a spirit distinct from the West ern Classical tradition. Probably the most notable - and potentially more controversial - significance of Coomaraswamy's pursuit lies in that attempt. How satisfactory his interpretations were or to what degree the framework he proposed can be admitted is problematic. In any case, it is noteworthy that his approach in asking what an image is and what a Buddha image is and in pursuing the problem on this basis was fundamentally different from the approaches of all other scholars at the time. Unfortu nately, his conceptual outlook to this problem, especially from the latest phase of his scholarship, does not seem to have been given much attention by most later scholars, probably due to the highly empir ical concerns that dominated the mind of researchers who worked on the issue. While his rather dis cursive essay "The Nature of Buddhist Art," rarely read by today's scholars, has its own problems and limitations, I believe that it may provide useful impetus to our further pursuit of the origin of the Bud dha image in a way that may look old-fashioned but remains surprisingly fresh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is a much expanded and revised version of the paper I initially wrote for the "Coomaraswamy" seminar taught by Joanna Williams at Berkeley in 1987. (A preliminary version was also published in Korean in Gangjwa mtsulsa 11,1998.) The seminar opened my eyes to a number of central problems in early Indian art and prompted me later to touch on the issue of the origin of the Buddha image from my own angle. The paper is a fitting tribute to Professor Williams, who has always been a great teacher and inspiring advisor. Professor Phyllis Granoff also read the manuscript and candidly shared with me her insightful assessment of Coomaraswamy's scholarship in a more critical spirit, which I hope to be able to read someday in publication. 170</page><page sequence="21">APPENDIX Writings by Coomaraswamy on the Origin of the Buddha Image = Works cited by Coomaraswamy that agree with or support his arguments. ?
