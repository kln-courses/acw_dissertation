<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Scar of Shame: Skin Color and Caste in Black Silent Melodrama by Jane Gaines When blacks began to finance and direct their own films in the teens and early 1920s, they consistently produced domestic melodramas. Some of these early productions have racial themes which reorganize the world in such a way that black heritage is rewarded over white paternity; they are schematic renunciations of the prevailing order of things in white American society where, historically, the discovery of black blood meant sudden reversal of fortune, social exclusion, or banishment.' Feminist studies of literary, cinematic, and theatrical melodrama have suggested that the melodramatic world view favors the weak over the strong as it adheres to a moral order which privileges the lesser and handicaps the greater. Since these new theories have shown that there is something genuinely affirming for women readers in narratives which organize the world around the female character and her domestic haven in the home, I wondered if domestic melodrama had ever produced an analogous position for black viewers or "readers," female or male.2 What I found surprised me. Although the black viewer is not exactly "affirmed" in the silent film text, this viewer is implicated in it in a way that is still pertinent to the whole project of understanding the subversive potential of domestic melodrama. At the outset I did not expect that it would be necessary to reconstruct the black viewer in history. Nor did I expect to find that cinema aesthetics and the aesthetics of racial distinction could be so closely linked. In fact, as I will argue, they are one and the same. My reading of The Scar of Shame (1927), one of the few silent melodramas with an all-black cast available for rental in the United States, is also an attempt to see how theories of literary and cinematic melodrama can be applied to Afro- American culture. Since, with a few exceptions, this heritage has not been submitted to any systematic analysis as mass culture, I offer this approach as an example of how we might deal with cultural products which are politically offensive to later generations of black American viewers.3 The advantage of this approach is that since it does not measure mass culture against high culture, the people who enjoy popular entertainment are not condemned by association with it. In order to consider the black viewer in 1927, whom we will never exactly "know," and about whom we can always ask more, I will take up the problems of melodramatic mode of address, the use of the mulatta type, the subversive aspects of style, and the reception of the "happy ending."

This viewer will undoubtedly note that the narrative represents the tragedy in the film as the consequence of a social class division within the black community. What, then, is meant by the intertitles which lay the blame on a caste system? Why the use of a term that denotes a social ranking scheme that is even more rigid than a class-based system?4 Immediately, The Scar of Shame raises issues regarding the race and class constitution of the audience which bear on its mode of address. To begin with, the history of black motion picture production and exhibition shows that "race movies," or those films produced specifically for all-black audiences, were created by the black bourgeoisie, often in collaboration with whites, for the entertainment and edification of the group below them. In the 1920s, this class difference would have been further emphasized by the northern urban versus southern rural distinction as the increased migration of southern blacks created a new proletariat that became the audience for the black theatrical product. Two other factors suggest that black entrepreneurs addressed a group of social unequals who would have been finding diversion at the movies. First, "respectable" blacks, who could claim this distinction merely by virtue of having lived longer in the North, held themselves above popular entertainments which were not sanctioned by their churches. Second, literacy levels suggest that motion pictures and records more than printed material provided entertainment for the new arrivals from the South.5 Some clarification about the class structure of urban black society in the United States in the 1920s is essential here since the configuration has been historically misunderstood and systematically ignored by blacks as well as whites. Briefly, toward the end of the nineteenth century, black society was characterized by a small group of aristocrats at the top and a small group of social outcasts at the bottom. The group between, made up of 80 to 90 percent of the black population, is difficult to compare with the white middle-class in the same period. Although income level and occupation would place individuals in this group below those in the white structural middle, persons in this group had a claim to respectability within the black community. The rearrangement of this center was under way by the 1920s, as the black structure came to resemble the upper-, middle-, and lower-class breakdown of the dominant society.6 The Scar of Shame gropes for a target audience in this social shuffle. Thus, the film creates a phantom social hierarchy in which black society struggles to make its own illusory "middle" while economic conditions having to do with the black migration North are enlarging the lower group. My argument depends on seeing race films as part of bourgeois ideology, but at the same time as playing to a race and class consciousness even upper-class blacks would have by virtue of their antagonistic relationship to capital. I will be less interested in making direct connections between political positions espoused in the film and the race and class positions of the producers, although later I will fill out the production 4 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="3">history of the film in these terms. The melodramatic text is not, after all, the place where such positions are set out clearly as in a debate; rather, it is the place where they encounter trouble. British work on film melodrama as bourgeois form helps explain the co- existence within the same film of the "bootstraps" philosophy informing so many of the race movie narratives from this period, and the melodramatic world view. As a literary form which has thrived in the bourgeois epoch, melodrama carries bourgeois assumptions about power-it presumes that everyone has a little.7 This assumption that "something can be done" is carried by the bourgeois voice of responsibility-the intertitles which assign fault to the top and bottom classes (e.g., "Our people have much to learn"). This portrait of a self-contained black society makes no reference to the white outer world, but I would argue that the willing self-critical tone of the intertitles betrays a judgmental presence. The Scar of Shame is haunted by white society. If the intertitles carry the self-confident bourgeois assumptions about power, the narrative carries a vision of a world in which the strings are pulled somewhere else. The marks of a melodramatic narrative construction-the use of coincidence and ironic twists of fate-create a sense that control is always out of one's hands, confirming the point of view of the disenfranchised. Martha Vicinus, among other critics, distinguishes mel- odrama from tragedy on the basis of the power position it confirms: "Tragedy appeals to those who feel, however erroneously, that they have some control over lives ruined by personal decision and error; melodrama to those who feel that their lives are without order and that events they cannot control can destroy or save them."8 The "racial uplift" pitch is attached to a film that speaks defeat in its downward narrative spiral. Melodrama has no trouble with such contradictions, but actually camouflages social inconsistencies by focusing on their traumatic consequences-victimization, despondency, and pathos, although, as theories of melodrama have shown, these inconsistencies are not so easy to disguise in the last moment when the form calls for resolution. Melodrama reenacts a moral pattern which coincides with the value system in operation within a community at a particular point in history. In the parallel world constructed by melodrama, it is safe to raise emotionally volatile issues and test traumatic outcomes. Because the moral pattern, the distribution of reward and punishment in melodrama, is always tailor-made to fit local assumptions and prevailing theses, it stirs an audience in its time but may never strike a chord for another generation. An extremely malleable and susceptible genre, melodrama accommodates the social problems of every new decade, translating them into hypothetical scenarios.9 Melodrama, then, may accommodate both the address which assumes some power and the order of events which counsels resignation. Thus it combines a sense of the way things have come down historically in the black community with the bourgeois uplift strategy, saying in effect: "Because we haven't helped ourselves enough, we are still subject to discrimination, disaster, and degradation." Racial uplift stories lend themselves to melodramatic treatment because the uplift philosophy, like melodrama, is built upon a basic paradox. Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 5</page><page sequence="4">Explaining the peaceful coexistence of oppositional values and traditional norms within the same genre, Vicinus identifies the paradox of melodrama. As she puts it, "... while defending an ideal against a vengeful society, in the name of a higher moral order, in actuality this moral order is a reflection of the current values of the very society presumably being attacked."'? What was problematic about the black bourgeois uplift philosophy was that the better society it proposed was not significantly different from the one that held all blacks down. The history of the tragic mulatta type in black-authored literature calls our attention to another aspect of the uplift strategy constituting one of the conven- tional battlefields of melodrama-woman's virtue. I refer here to the type which was first used in the abolitionist melodramas such as Clotel (1853) and lola Leroy (1895) and was carried over into such 1920s Harlem Renaissance novels as Quicksand (1928), Passing (1929), Plum Bun (1928), and There Is Confusion (1924)." This character, which finds its prototype in Clotel, Iola Leroy, and even Eliza Harris, is intelligent, refined, educated, virginal, and exquisitely beautiful according to Caucasian standards. She is like the white romance novel heroine in every way-except that her legal status as slave places her in degrading and compromising situations, designed to play on the guilt of the white reader who would be appalled by the defilement of a genteel lady. The black abolitionist novelist's use of this character as an ideal certainly indicates the hegemony of white physical standards of beauty, but we might also suppose that giving white readers something other than what they thought they were getting-their own idealized heroine who was not white-was a canny trick. This character, who of course did not appear at all in the white antebellum literature, was, in the use black authors made of her, an eloquent statement against several generations of southern male sexual license.'2 From a contemporary point of view, this type is offensive to blacks, but the portrait of the mulatta as talented and beautiful because of her white paternity might have been flattering to light-skinned readers before 1930. The portrayal of the type as tragic and pitiable would later be insulting to blacks as it was used to argue that the mulatta was miserable because she had been denied her rightful place in a society that excluded others of the same race because they were darker.13 Seen in a historical perspective, the type has more to say about white supremacist ideology than about actual black persons, although the con- dition of real historical black women can be inferred obliquely from the con- struction. As Barbara Christian has analyzed the ideological function of the refined mulatta, her "qualities" -traditional femininity and moral purity - were argu- ments necessary to proving that she was even a woman.'4 If she was a woman, then her honor had to be defended, and she could certainly not be the cause of white male sexual transgression.15 The type is thus like a several-sided cube which can be made to face in one direction while another side is concealed. In the earlier versions, the mulatta heroine could be used as a ruse to turn the tables on whites, or as a political strategy, or even as a utopian vision of security and transcendence. 6 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="5">Louise Howard, the mulatta heroine in The Scar of Shame, rehearses some of the disputes over the territory of the black woman's body raised by her literary predecessors. In the negative sense, she fulfills the prophecy of the poor (black) rather than the fine (white) ingredient in her paternity. Further, since in the 1920s lightness had come to stand for opportunity rather than rightful heritage, following this uplift interpretation she dies because she does not use the advantage her whiteness affords her; her tragedy of lost possibility is a setback for the entire race. As she combines exquisite white features and lower-class background, Louise is like those young women within the black community who once earned the snide reference, "a waste of color."'6 The meaning of the tragic mulatta character is not settled once and for all within this film, but she surfaces again as a recurring problem-that of racial respectability as it has been historically bound up with the virtue which black women were not supposed to have.'7 The Scar of Shame explores and exhausts all of the possible explanations for Louise's victimization as it thrashes around looking for culprits within the black community, even resurrecting the old nightmare of the loose mulatta.'8 The Scar of Shame. In 1969, a 35mm original print of The Scar of Shame (1927) was discovered among other nitrate films in a trash can in the basement of an empty theater in Detroit, Michigan.'9 Now restored and in 16mm distribution, this silent feature with an all-black cast has become one of the most frequently exhibited examples of our black cinema heritage, and has become source material for new black independent film and video-making, as evidenced in the reference to it in Kathy Collins's Losing Ground (1982).20 One of at least three films produced by the Colored Players of Philadelphia, The Scar of Shame represents a typical division of labor between black and white artists producing race movies in that period.21 Produced specifically for black motion picture audiences, The Scar of Shame was directed and photographed by white professionals and im- provised by black actors from a story written by the white producer, David Starkman.22 Although the Philadelphia production group was really run by Stark- man, the idea for The Colored Players originally came from black vaudeville comedian Sherman H. Dudley, Jr., who started a theatrical group with the same name in Washington, D.C. Dudley and Starkman, owner of a black theater in Philadelphia, organized the new company in 1926, and the black comedian, listed in the credits as producer of The Scar of Shame, also served as company president.23 The central victim of the story, Louise Howard (Lucia Lynn Moses), is molested by her "ne'er do well" father Spike, and rescued by Alvin Hillyard, an aspiring composer and pianist (Harry Henderson). Hillyard marries Louise to protect her from the father who continues to assault her, thus lifting her out of the lower class. After their marriage, the father's gambler friend Eddie Blake conspires with him to kidnap Louise and put her to work as a "lure" in a speakeasy. Caught in pistol crossfire between Eddie and Alvin, who tries to prevent the abduction, Louise is wounded in the neck, "her beauty marred for Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 7</page><page sequence="6">life," according to the newspaper report. Alvin goes to jail for the crime, and Louise takes up a life of prostitution and gambling. When Alvin escapes from jail and the two meet again, he has become engaged to the daughter of the powerful black lawyer Hathaway who frequents Eddie's speakeasy and becomes Louise's lover. Louise tries to win Alvin back, and when she fails, she takes poison. Louise's suicide note, which confesses that she had been wounded by Eddie's gun and not Alvin's, symbolically frees Alvin to marry Alice Hathaway, his social equal. The opening titles, almost a short lecture on social Darwinism, direct the viewer to interpret the film in terms of social class distinctions: Environment-Surroundings, childhood training... shapes our destinies and guides our ambitions. If no loving hand lights the lamp of knowledge... through lack of love will come sorrow and SHAME! The social class moral is reiterated in the final titles as the lawyer Hathaway speaks, bestowing his blessing on his daughter and Alvin Hillyard: "A child of environment! If she had been taught higher hopes, finer things in life, she would not be lying cold in death! Our people have much to learn."24 Social Darwinism would have provided one of the more progressive challenges to theories of genetic determinism, and certainly would have been complementary to the philosophy and goals of Negro improvement and advancement. The titles proclaim that environment, rather than any person, is the villain, but the urban social condition provides its own anthropomorphic villainous agents in the scum it breeds -Eddie and Spike.25 What is important to note here is that in blaming the environment, The Scar of Shame sidesteps the more devastating color critique, the criticism of black social stratification based on skin color gradations which would later become a harsh indictment in E. Franklin Fraser's Black Bourgeoisie.26 There would be advantages to the black bourgeois social program in shifting the emphasis from the skin color distinction, about which an individual could do nothing, to education, employment, and income-relatively attainable indicators of status. Understandably, black history and sociology would support a shift of emphasis from the "pettiness" of physiological distinctions which characterized earlier periods, to other signs of differentiation.27 In retrospect, we can appreciate the strategy, but, in the determination of social rank, we cannot easily extricate one sign of difference from another, and in American society, race seems to encompass a multitude of distinctions. My emphasis on skin color here is an attempt to fill out the larger picture which The Scar of Shame refers to in its silence, to look harder at the visible/invisible dialectic of "racial difference," which, like the signified "breeding," has not always required a signifier in highly stratified societies. In the preferred version of social conflict in The Scar of Shame, however, the highest and lowest classes in black society are responsible for the reputation of the lower orders and especially for the degradation and mistreatment of black women. The black dual responsibility interpretation encourages the discovery of 8 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="7">a second victim--Alvin (who his landlady, Mrs. Lucretia Green, expects will become "the leading composer of our race"). Alvin is imprisoned as the direct consequence of the downward pull of the more disreputable Negro element-- Eddie, Spike, and Louise (as she works in league with them). Louise's confession reveals not only that it was the shot from Eddie's gun which injured her, but that Eddie and Spike prevented her from telling the truth at the time of the trial. Is the most compelling victim in the film also a villainess? The film seems to hesitate here, at least long enough for one critic to interpret Louise as "wicked."28 Louise is, after all, no longer the pure mulatta heroine. I would argue, however, that Louise's villainy is effectively cancelled since she is so sympathetically and lovingly coded as tragic heroine. Treated to a good deal of soft focus attention in close-up against a dark background, Louise is featured in the same photographic style used on D. W. Griffith's haloed innocents. This sympathetic visual inter- pretation of Louise is part of my case for seeing an oppositional discourse in the codes of lighting and framing which I discuss in a later section. Following the preferred reading, Louise and Alvin, in competition as victims, contribute to the portrait of black self-victimization on which the "if only" and the "what might have been" appeals are based. Because their fates are linked, Louise's act of sacrifice is pitiable but not glorious, and the union of Alice and Alvin is proper rather than happy. Although one "hope of the race" is rescued and his reputation restored, the resolution is ragged, and like the often discomforting melodramatic closure, which I will discuss in the conclusion, it leaves the viewer with a bitter taste. The structure of The Scar of Shame further supports the case for the culpability of the upper and lower classes. Plotting to separate Alvin and Louise by sending a fake telegram to Alvin which states that his mother is seriously ill, Eddie and Spike pull Louise back to the gutter. The aristocratic class contributes to the desecration of the black woman in another way. The arrival of the fake telegram occasions Alvin's confession to Louise that his mother does not know that they have married. (Title: "Caste is one of the things mother is very de- termined about. You don't belong to our set.") The Negro aristocracy and the lower orders then act in league with one another. This characterization of the two classes at the extreme ends of the social spectrum corresponds with a kind of scapegoating seen in the black community during this period. While the lower classes were viewed as dragging others down, the higher were seen as holding up impossible hurdles for other blacks while clamoring upward on their backs.29 This joint villainy of the lower and the upper classes is elaborately coor- dinated in the abduction scene as it is cross-cut between Eddie and Spike outside the boarding house, Alvin driving to the suburbs and returning, and Louise alone in her bedroom. Here Louise is the vehicle for elaborating the toll these conflicts take on families - expressed in terms of emotional turmoil, and represented by shots of her discovery of the letter from Alvin's mother (shown earlier). The mother's letter states that she hopes her son will marry Helen Smith, who plays the piano and is "very lovely, a lady, and one of our set." Inserts of the letter Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 9</page><page sequence="8">are alternated with shots of Alvin driving away, and the directionality of these shots suggests his allegiance to his mother and her social position. The mother, although not present in the film, is powerfully evoked by the letter as well as by the uniformed black butler who receives Alvin at the suburban home. After Louise finds the letter in Alvin's dresser drawer and reads it, she slowly rips the paper into fine pieces. The following shot, from her point of view, is an insert of her wedding certificate. Here, the decorous quaintness of this icon is incon- gruous with the moment. As Louise starts to tear the stiff parchment decorated with garlands of orchids and embossed with the words "Holy Matrimony," the film cuts to Alvin racing to his mother. From here, the film cuts back to the slow vertical movement of Louise ripping the sacred document. As Alvin leaves his mother's house and drops his door key, the film cuts to close-ups of Louise's hand as she twists off her wedding band. The cross-cutting pattern, then, estab- lishes a cause and effect relationship between the elitism of the aristocracy and the breakup of black families. Melodrama, as contemporary critics have asserted, translates ideological dilemmas into private predicaments.30 The family context serves to intensify these struggles-cruelty and brutality "carry an additional emotional force because they occur between family members."31 The social injustice of the Negro upper class is here represented in terms of Louise's torn heart. In this emotional whirl- pool, Louise's distress is made to seem the cause of the breakup rather than the effect of political conditions beyond her control. Thus, as Alvin is racing back to Louise, his marriage is being destroyed by her hand. By the time Eddie arrives to try to abduct Louise, the damage is done; the remnants of respectability lie shredded on the lace doily on top of a chest of drawers. I have already noted the debt The Scar of Shame owes to Afro-American literature and theatrical melodrama. However, aesthetically the film owes all to D. W. Griffith. The Scar of Shame seems constructed out of memorable moments from Intolerance (1916) and Broken Blossoms (1919). Louise's struggles with her father refer to Lucy's beatings in Broken Blossoms; the scene in which Spike breaks into his daughter's room makes ugly homage to the elongated rape and murder scene for the earlier film.32 The shooting scene is likewise almost lifted intact out of the modern story from Intolerance. Like the scene in which The Boy is set up for the killing of The Musketeer, it is organized around the fire escape. Alvin is forced to enter up the fire escape because he has lost his key, and he surprises Eddie and Louise as he comes through the window. As in the scene from Intolerance, the innocent person is framed because of the disap- pearance of the guilty one.33 In addition to these direct references, the intricate cross-cutting of the rescue scene reminds us of all the last-minute interventions in silent cinema to save the virtue of a woman. Critics have linked the convention as Griffith used it with his championing of the American home and family. Nick Browne describes the fantasy behind this use of parallel editing: "This scenario of rescue is essentially a chivalrous project couched in a kind of medieval and allegorical idiom that has as its end the stabilization of the place and integrity 10 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="9">of the bourgeois family against the threat of abandonment, dismemberment, homelessness, or worse...."34 Ironically, the structure which D. W. Griffith used in Birth of a Nation (1915) to signify the black threat to white womanhood and the glorious rush to save it, is recruited here to rally around the protection of black womanhood. The double movement in this scene, suggesting Alvin's divided allegiance, shows that this marriage cannot be saved. For Alvin Hillyard, thrust into the heroic position within the cross-cutting structure, the rescue of his wife and the maintenance of his family is an impossibility; he walks into a trap. The conflicted black hero cannot protect and will not triumph. After Louise destroys her marriage certificate, the film shifts premises, as though it, too, must continue even without the benefit of marriage, and it offers a justification for the symbolic annulment of the union between the characters. Although Alvin has acted to protect his rightful marriage, the film represents the cross-caste marriage as wrong from the start. The wrongness of Alvin's marriage is born out in one clear way-by the kind of evidence pointed to by old wives tales through the ages. The sad story is told here by the intertitle which separates Alvin's impassioned proposal to Louise from the first shot rep- resenting their married life. From the intertitle "Three months later," the film cuts to a close up of a dark baby doll in white christening gown and bonnet. In the second shot, the only one with the family intact, Louise cradles the doll, which is remarkably darker than either parent. The faked motherhood tells the tale of Louise's fondest hopes and worst expectations-the marriage is infertile. Later, in the desertion scene, when Alvin tells Louise that she cannot go with him to his mother's home because she doesn't know they have been married, the toy plays another role. The surrogate baby becomes a third victim in the film- and its fate is the most heart-wrenching. As Alvin picks up his suitcase to leave, the doll is accidentally knocked to the floor, and on his way out the door, unknowingly, he steps on its head.3 Two exterior shots follow, one locating Spike lurking in the street and another showing Alvin getting into his convertible. Then, the film cuts back to the interior showing the doll in close-up without its head. The title carries Louise's exclamation: "Poor little thing! A victim of caste." The disaster of this marriage is told in Louise's tender attentions to the headless doll which she first clasps to her and then throws into the corner, and in this gesture we recognize a familiar argument against marriages which go against social convention-children neglected and abused. Caste and Class. But is the child a victim of caste as the title says, or of class prejudice? This usage, as I have noted, is one of the more curious aspects of the film encountered by the contemporary viewer, and the issues with which the film is dealing are easily missed by the white viewer with no background in Afro-American history. To black audiences in 1927, class and caste would have had resounding significance. The upper or aristocratic class held to an elaborate rationale for maintaining their distinctness from the lower levels, and this en- gendered certain hostility. Hortense Powdermaker describes how the rest of black Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 11</page><page sequence="10">society participated in this deference by default as they begrudgingly adhered to the values which reinforced the hierarchy: "The Negro upper class acts out for its race the denial that Negroes are inferior; it demonstrates that they too can be educated, moral, industrious, thrifty. This class also reaps a fair share of resentment from other members of its race, but here resentment is far less keen and less conscious, and is offset by substantial advantages, among which is to be numbered a very gratifying prestige."36 Philadelphia, the home of the Colored Players, had a very old aristocratic society of Negroes as well as a rich literary tradition that paralleled the Harlem Renaissance.37 The justification for sepa- rateness offered by those who considered themselves superior was that by example they would inspire the lower orders to improve themselves. The author of Sketches of Colored Society (1841), writes: "If the virtuous and exemplary members of society should not keep aloof from the vicious and worthless, they would furnish no example to the latter to strive to make them selves reputable, and of like consideration. By associating with such persons we not only thereby give coun- tenance to their doings, but we degrade ourselves to their level, and are adjudged accordingly."38 Thus their strategy was that full acceptance depended upon prov- ing that blacks could be equal to whites in their cultured tastes and their achieve- ments, hence the tight circle dedicated so fiercely to pursuing "finer things." Although sensitive about being mistaken for the serving class, some elite families saw nothing inconsistent in employing other blacks as servants. In his turn-of- the-century study of Philadelphia, W. E. B. Du Bois found that in the 277 upper- class families he studied, fifty-two kept servants. It was Du Bois's conviction that the upper classes should help the lower to rise, but he found that this group was too economically unstable and strategically self-protective to do so. As Du Bois explains it, "the class which should lead refuses to head any race movement on the plea that thus they draw the very color line against which they protest."39 Or, to take a position against racial discrimination would be to distinguish them- selves even further from whites, and thus cut themselves off from the small, and possibly imagined, advantage they enjoyed. This group of blacks, then, as John Dollard describes them, "stood beating at the caste barrier, competent and dis- ciplined in the sense desired by our society but categorically debarred from full status." In the sociological literature on race in the period of Reconstruction through the 1940s, caste designates the fixed line between the races one technically could never cross. In the South, the caste division essentially replaced slavery.40 Theoretically, caste defines a more rigid separation than class, which allows for some fluidity. In the United States, then, there would be social classes within caste, and within the black caste, the class system would operate at particular periods in deference to the whole, according to the rules of caste.41 The history of miscegenation and the phenomenon of crossing over or passing in American society has a bearing on The Scar of Shame as it fills out our knowledge about the black spectator. Pertinent here is the white society's vac- illation regarding the meaning and the value of racial mixing. Originally, during the period of slavery, the established scale of valuation gave a social advantage 12 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="11">to Negroes with white blood and an economic advantage to the masters who could claim a higher sale price for slave property with white features. Later, the house slave versus field slave distinctions established by percentage of white blood became the basis of the earliest "blue vein" societies in the northern cities. As black society observed preferential treatment and absorbed white cultural biases, it came to embrace the same physiological ideals. This connection between light skin and economic success was born out again during Reconstruction when the first profits in black economic ventures were handed to those who bore the greatest likeness to whites.42 Abruptly, white society withdrew the favors offered to the relatively lighter few, taking the position that no fraction of Negro blood was acceptable. Some lighter blacks adjusted to this by passing, but this was a phenomenon more mythic than real, and, especially in the 1920s, racial pride may have kept a check on the practice.43 Whereas white ancestry had once been a sign of esteem, by the 1940s it would be a sign of disgrace in many communities.44 The black aristocratic class was slow to respond to the loss of their edge of privilege and continued to insist on it, holding over the tribute to and convenient defense of white su- premacy.45 Alsb held over were the stubborn tastes and preferences for light skin, Caucasian facial features, and white hair-form. In 1927, there would be deference to a skin color hierarchy in the black community at the same time that there would be antagonism toward it. The Political Aesthetics of Skin Color. My sense of The Scar of Shame is that it accommodates both the deference and the antagonism. However, it seems to me that the way in which it is open to the antagonism is a way which forces us to reconsider theories of the subversive potential of domestic melodrama, particularly the British Marxist work on cinema produced in the early 1970s. The model proposed and refined by the British critics finds a subversive space in melodrama that is not there in other American genres. This space is found in the difference between narrative and mise-en-scene, which are understood as having a kind of contrapuntal relationship.46 In this two-tiered textual arrange- ment, the stylistic level below can comment on, and even criticize, the surface level which carries the plot line, characterized as carrying the bourgeois world view. This theory of subversive stylistics developed out of an interest in the flam- boyant 1950s melodramas of Ophuls, Minnelli, and Sirk. Thus theories of stylistic contradiction in silent melodrama have so far been developed in relation to an exceptional moment in the 1950s. In Thomas Elsaesser's formulation, for instance, there is a line of development from silent film stylistics (which evolved as a cinema language to compensate for the lost expressivity of speech) and the aesthetics made possible in the 1950s by technical innovations such as Technicolor, power zooms, and dolly shots. The 1950s auteurs, in this account, stand for the fullest realization of melodramatic expressivity in cinema history.47 Immediately, there are several problems with adapting this theory to the black audience Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 1 3</page><page sequence="12">melodrama. First, there are different degrees of "stylistic comment" in both silent and 1950s melodrama. Most expressivity in silent cinema could not be considered as parodic as, for instance, the Sirkian use of the slow motion cut-glass baubles in the opening credits of Imitation of Life (1959), which offer the famous "through a glass darkly" vision of bourgeois family life.48 Second, this theory of stylistic orchestration really calls for the hand of the auteur who can be credited with making the text reveal its contradictions. Third, the space which opens up the possibilities for resistance is an empty one. A space in and of itself cannot split a gaping text. What is required is a critic or a reader who is either politically primed or slightly jaundiced.49 Finally, I would mention the psychoanalytic aspect of this theory which hypothesizes a cause and effect relationship between the stylistic expressivity or excess and the impossibility of closure. The mark of style, like an hysterical symptom, manifests itself before the ending, and the film, like the psychoanalytic patient, must repress the tabooed, which returns in another guise as the formal symptom. I will return momentarily to the issue of closure and the politics of the hysterical text, but first I want to take up the question of the reader-viewer's space. In The Scar of Shame, the stylistic discourse carrying the melos is connected to the aesthetics of skin tone and hair texture played out in light, shadow, and shade. This color scheme or code would be known in its finer gradations and variations only to black audiences-to the group that would read a wealth of significance in the difference between processed and unprocessed coiffure, and would be sensitive to all kinds of hair-splitting along caste lines. At the end of the film this color scheme becomes stylistically highlighted in the cross-cutting between Alice and Louise. Here the empathetic effects clearly favor the latter. Where Alice is filmed in silhouette, backlit against black drapery, Louise is framed full-face in long, languid, glowing close-ups. While the accom- plished Alice is playing the piano (unaware that she may be providing the diegetic source for the melos which evokes sympathy for her rival), Louise is dying. Visual style elaborates the contrast between the two worlds-an elegant can- delabra provides the illumination behind Alice, while Louise's life is snuffed out as a single candle burns down. The full-bodied, suffering woman is preferred over the ethereal but still adolescent piano pupil, and in Alice, with her shiny long dark curls and thin delicate nose, there is an intimation that the sheltered Negro class, living out lives of deference and imitation, is finally anemic. The mise-en-scene here provides commentary, but can the signifiers in and of themselves cause much trouble in the text? (We are also handicapped in our analysis of those silent films which do not have original orchestral, organ, or piano scores. This music might have functioned as ironic comment much as Elsaesser's calliope or organ grinder, particularly if a black pianist were simul- taneously responding to the audience and interpreting the screen action in an all-black theater.)50 What is really required to resist, split, or rupture a text is the skeptical audience member who notes that the text is saying more than one thing at once, as texts will do. But we also have to consider that historically 14 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="13">situated viewers accommodate contradictions and multiple meanings in much the same way that texts combine levels of signification. Would the text necessarily "rupture" if the black viewer accommodated its split by means of a double consciousness developed as an ingenious adjustment to living in two societies at once? I find two stories in The Scar of Shame. In an earlier part of this essay I discussed the story about an interracially divided community, the story the in- tertitles hold to and the narrative structure supports. In contrapuntal opposition, in the mise-en-scene, I find the ghost of a second story about life in a racist society, and I would maintain that this other story has not been orchestrated in the authorial sense. But neither is it exactly the doing of the text. "Criticism," says Terry Eagleton, "is not a passage from text to reader; its task is not to redouble the text's self-understanding, to collude with its object in a conspiracy of eloquence. Its task is to show the text as it cannot know itself, to manifest those conditions of its making (inscribed in its very letter) about which it is necessarily silent."51 The Scar of Shame is not able to speak about its own subtle racism or about the racism in the black film industry in the 1920s. On the screen the actors playing Louise, Alvin, Alice, and the baser element, Eddie, appear exactly the same degree of light brown. The actor playing Spike, Louise's father, seems darker than the other actors (with the exception of the inhabitants of the local bar). Since this darkness might be connoted by the stubble on his face, the father's crude behavior could be motivated by either environmental factors (the slovenly habits of the underclass) or by genetic factors (race). Since we are presented with a basically monochromatic cast, it would seem that "on the face of it," The Scar of Shame is about the rift within black society and not about color caste distinctions based on the white model at all. Let us assume that the film means what the titles insist it means for a moment-if that is possible- and consider something else. Could a film which was frankly about color caste within black society have been made at all in 1927, considering the discriminating color caste system operating within the black film industry? At that time, the color bar in Hollywood worked in reverse of the ban in the white world. That is, light-skinned blacks could not find work in white motion pictures. Black and white film stock registered too much truth-on the screen racially mixed actors looked white. Conversely, the dark-skinned blacks preferred by white producers were unacceptable in star roles in race films. They were not idealized (i.e., white) enough.52 In 1927, it would have been impossible to have made a popular vehicle about an exquisitely beautiful black woman who was cut out of elite blue vein society because she was too dark. A black production company could not have cast such a film53 While the monochrome appearance of the actors guarantees that The Scar of Shame is about intraracial strife, the casting qualifies this message. Realism, that unacknowledged attempt to make the screen world correspond with popular notions about the real world so that audiences are not confused, betrays the assumptions that inform the ghost film. Louise and Alice may be the same skin Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 15</page><page sequence="14">shade, but of the two, on a scale of physical characteristics that also matches hair texture and facial features, Alice, the upper-class woman, is more white. Or, The Scar of Shame argues that environmental factors determine social stand- ing, but represents a society divided in terms of racial characteristics socially read as percentage of white blood; it pleads for community unity, but warns about the consequences of crossing racial as well as class lines. Conclusion. "The tendency of melodrama to culminate in a happy end is not unopposed. The happy end is often impossible, and, what is more, the audience knows it is impossible," Nowell-Smith says in the context of his discussion of fifties melodrama.54 Further, he says, melodramatic stylistics, the hysterical "symp- toms" referred to earlier, are a by-product of commitment to the "realistic" portrayal of a social problem. Here, the analogy between the text and the unconscious does not help the cause of race and class struggle. What kind of political strategy can be forged if racial antagonism is located in the depths of the unconscious?55 The stylistics of The Scar of Shame speaks that which is unspeakable, but the aesthetic excess lavished in the comparison of Louise and Alice tells most as it declares itself socially rather than psychoanalytically symp- tomatic. If an adherence to representing the situation "the way things are" cannot be consistently maintained through to a happy outcome, it is because of political realities outside the text. The opposition to the happy end comes from the preceding events, but also, Nowell-Smith suggests, it comes from the viewers who know the odds of one outcome over another based on their own expert knowledge of social life.56 This comment, one of the few direct references to reception to be found in all of the British melodrama theory from the 1970s, allows that aesthetic excess is not just a matter of auteurist insight or the text's formal properties. A reader is required. Further, as this theory of the imperfect happy ending has been interpreted, the opposition to neat closure has to do with the audience's estimation of the character's chances for happiness in bourgeois society.57 The epilogue to The Scar of Shame, with its union of Alice and Alvin and the uplift benediction delivered by the corrupt lawyer Hathaway, Alice's father and Louise's client, is ill-fitting. The death of Louise is an unsatisfactory condition of uplift and the marriage an unsatisfying solution. In a racist society, these bonds may prove brittle. What of my original question regarding the position of the viewer in the domestic melodrama produced for black audiences? I do not see that The Scar of Shame offers the black "reader" the privileged place that is offered, for instance, in such novels as lola Leroy, which shows black characters as morally superior to whites and mulatto characters choosing black society over white. More needs to be done on this question, and the research is complicated by the fact that so few black-produced films from this period remain. To some degree, we also have to admit that merely seeing images of black life on the screen in a motion picture theater would have been affirming for the 1927 audience. Beyond that, we still need to consider the therapeutic function of melodrama theorized by feminists 1 6 Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987</page><page sequence="15">analyzing romance fiction, gothics, and soap opera, which shows how readers may be invited to rehearse their own victimization and its reversal within the same plot.58 The feminist re-evaluation which sees the domestic melodrama as meaningful confrontation rather than escape and avoidance suggests that the end of The Scar of Shame could simultaneously fan smoldering resentments and convey hope: "Happy endings do not necessarily ignore issues; rather melodrama places the most profound problems in a moral context and thereby makes them manageable. By insisting on the ultimate triumph of social and personal justice, melodrama is able to provide consolation and hope without denying the social reality that makes goodness and justice so fragile."59 For black readers, then, domestic melodrama would have made the cruel irrationality of social and political disenfranchisement seem manageable; cast in personal terms, injustice could almost seem to be dealt with finally and absolutely. Ideals of fairness and equality could appear to win out at least temporarily over bigotry, heartlessness, and malevolence. The advantage of this argument is finally the way in which it credits the audiences of The Scar of Shame who might have viewed the film in these terms. With ingenuity the viewer could also glean some political satisfaction in seeing these domestic melodramas produced for black audiences but projected with whites looking over their shoulders. I even imagine the black viewer in 1927 performing a kind of transposition which would go beyond seeing the upper class as effete and impotent. The title of the film identifies a central metaphor and a peculiar inversion. Before the black pride movement, blacks in the United States might have seen color as a stigma either carried by and projected onto themselves, or tied up in some way with interracial conflicts. The Scar of Shame, however, carefully shows that Louise is stigmatized as the result of intraracial class strife. Like the drop of black blood, Louise's scar, although not visible, still dooms her to a life of dissipation, a strange harkening back to the loose mulatta from earlier antebellum literature. Intraracial class distinctions in 1927 might well have been experienced and understood in similar terms as interracial black- white differences. Class difference within black society was then analogous to caste difference between races in the United States, and, therefore, the term caste in a metaphoric and slightly exaggerated sense would stand for all such invidious distinctions, and would function characteristically in melodrama to stir emotions and touch raw nerves. Notes 1. After the advent of sound and the Depression, this product was a mix of genres- comedy, Western, musical, as well as melodrama. In the black turn-about melo- dramas, black heritage is generously rewarded, as in By Right of Birth (1921) in which a California coed is forced to leave school when she finds she is part Negro. She later inherits a fortune in land, and is reunited with a lost parent. Call of His People (1922) holds up a light-skinned hero whose success in the business world is certain as long as his race is undetected, but the darker-skinned woman he loves and her brother dramatize the choice he must make between his black birthright and his Cinema Journal 26, No. 4, Summer 1987 17</page><page sequence="16">career. His decision to acknowledge his race is rewarded by a seeming miracle-his employer turns out to be unexpectedly liberal. The best source for these plot de- scriptions is Harry T.

This diffused villainy is consistent with the historical development of melodrama in which the earlier villainy of the natural disaster or the slimy character was replaced by social institutions. Michael Walker, in "Melodrama and the American Cinema," Movie 29/30 (Summer 1982): 35, suggests that as patriarchial laws and class structures took over for the villain, prohibition replaced wickedness: The prohibitions and repressions which these generate are in place of the villain's wicked deeds. And such a shift inevitably introduces problems. On the one hand, the ideology endeavours to affirm the laws of patriarchy, the class and gender determined position, as "good," and punishes transgressions; on the other, au- dience sympathy is usually with the transgressing characters. When the punish- ments, often directed against female characters, lead to the same sort of sufferings as in traditional melodrama, the ideology is unconsciously functioning as the villain. 26. E.
