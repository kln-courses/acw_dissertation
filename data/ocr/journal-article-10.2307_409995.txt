<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Grundlegung und Grundprobleme der Syntax. By MORITZ REGULA. (Bibliothek der allgemeinen Sprachwissenschaft; zweite Reihe, Einzeluntersuchungen und Darstellungen.) Pp. 202. Heidelberg: Carl Winter, Universit~itsverlag, 1951. The title arouses expectations which the book does not satisfy. It is not an analysis of the linguistic phenomena of morpheme sequence in relation to mor- pheme distribution, which, I take it, is the province of syntax. Instead, the book presents phrases, clauses, and sentences of Latin and Greek and some modern West European languages-chiefly German and French, with less representation of English and Spanish. It is a study of those continua as expressions of human thought patterns. One has the feeling that the sand has been running uphill in the hourglass when one compares Regula's 1951 procedure with Otto Behaghel's confident statement in 1897 (Syntax des Heliand vii): 'Zwar sucht man nicht mehr Kant'sche Kate- gorien auf die Sprache zu iibertragen ... Man hat es gelernt, von der Form statt vom Inhalt bei der Er6rterung auszugehen.' On p. 15 Regula describes the evolution of language from primitive interjec- tions to the volitional announcement of the content of consciousness; language is said to have attained an astonishingly high development among Kulturvilker. He announces (7) his desire to give an 'insight into the linguistic-philosophical and the linguistic-psychological bases of syntax'; and although he recognizes (8) the desirability of separating 'linguistic thinking and linguistic technique from the substantial content', it is clear from his procedure that this separation is in the sense of distinguishing between an effect and a cause. Explicitly, the linguistic act is described (17) as an announcement of the result of analyzing an 'integral psychological substratum'. The material of mental activity, which it is the function of language to announce, is divided (18) into three major categories: immediate personal impressions (experiences, recollec- tions), scientific (events, facts, principles), hypothetical (imaginations, assump- tions, lies). The clincher is the axiom on p. 23: 'Nihil est in lingua, quod non antea fuerit in intellectu.' However unobjectionable this statement may be for pur- poses of biography, linguists will prefer the sociologically more valid formulation: Nihil est in intellectu, quod non antea fuerit in lingua. It is not surprising to find (31) that although imperatives are one-constituent in form, they are really two-constituent in meaning; definitions of Wortarten (73-7) as varieties of the psychic analysis preceding and determining speech; and a description of grammatical gender (81) in terms of primitive ways of thought: the modern survivals of fanciful, anthropomorphic tropes. Which, again, may or may not be the case; one asks what such speculations have to do with syntax. One reads (86) that the English a pick up dinner, a sit down supper are 'agram- matical'; a speaker of English must conclude that 'agrammatical' means 're- calcitrant in terms of limited and possibly irrelevant criteria'. This conclusion is reinforced by the author's listing (and be it credited to his honesty) 'Sonder- 112</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 113 erscheinungen' (99, 135) and 'Besonderheiten' (121). The 'improper (pseudo-) reflexive', we are told (124-5), serves (1) to paraphrase a passive (Die Tiir Offnet sich) and (2) to indicate a process or event occurring within something (Die Strassen leeren sich). In short, it is this reviewer's judgment that the book is concerned with abso- lute laws of thought and with universal human modes of expression of psychologi- cal events, not with language. It is restricted to a study of one cultural tradition, and to one sub-group of languages (centum Indo-European, not including Celtic or Tocharian) associated with that tradition. Within these drastic limitations (drastic in view of the title) the book displays ingenuity and thoughtful study of several European languages. It should be helpful to teachers and learners who are concerned with problems of translation from one of those languages into another. For the linguist, it offers material for the study of the diffusion of linguistic patterns throughout a culture area. Many of the parallelisms here brought to light are indeed characteristic of a West European style of language structure, a style which overrides the isoglosses within the West European area. The fact that, in several distinct West European languages, parallel construc- tions reveal similar heterogeneities of semantic function is a proper object of systematic linguistic research; Regula's book offers much material for it, in useful form. The predominance of literary, even poetic quotations as illustra- tions of syntactic patterns and meaning-categories impairs this usefulness; but it is not difficult to make due allowance for the imbalance. The book is well indexed. The number of misprints is not excessive; the spell- ing 'L. Blomfield' (73, 185) is perhaps to be explained by the author's loss of his library and some of his notes, described on p. 7. The same reason may account for the howler on p. 26, where the opening lines of 'Trilber Tag. Feld' are ascribed to the Kerkerszene of Faust I. W. F. TWADDELL, Brown University</page></plain_text>
