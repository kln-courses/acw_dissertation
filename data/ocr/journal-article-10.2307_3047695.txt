<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LISBON TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH CHARLES D. CUTTLER Tu lux astrorum, tu decus astrigerum," sang mediaeval monks in praise of monasticism's legendary founder, St. Anthony Abbot: "Anachoreta potens, pastor, patriarcha, magister. .. ." In adoration and reverence the laity was equally fervent when at the close of the mediaeval period St. Anthony achieved his apogee in art, literature, and the popular mind. His famous temptations struck the imagination, and appealed particularly to Jerome Bosch.' However, the striking originality of Bosch's several versions of the temptation theme, with their visionary and even realistic portrayal of the world, can be understood only in terms of his era. It was a time of pestilence and turbulence, of economic, social, and religious unrest; an age which believed in chiliasm, Antichrist, apocalyptic visions; in witchcraft, alchemy, and astrology. On the other hand it was an age of rational investigation and humanistic approach. It was also a period of extreme pessimism, the natural outcome of a belief in demons fostered by the Church itself-it was Thomas Aquinas who had said that all that happens visibly in this world can be done by demons." With the world so under the control of the Devil, what chance then had the average man of achieving salvation? The great scholastics having set the stage, the fears of the age leading to demonomania were confirmed and concretely expressed in the papal bull, Summis desiderantes ... of Innocent VIII, issued on December 9, 1484. The content and tone of the bull is well repre- sented by the following extract: x. Born at Coma, Egypt, in 251, St. Anthony was the pious son of rich Christians. Their death when he was about eighteen or twenty left him wealthy, but he gave his money away to lead a life of piety (according to Matthew 19:21). Devilish temptations in the form of evil thoughts, lusts, and desires of all kinds soon disturbed him, the Devil even assum- ing the most seductive feminine form to shake his resolve, but without success. Then Anthony left his village to live in the tombs nearby, and there underwent the famous temptation so frequently depicted in art and literature. According to Cax- ton's translation of the Vitae patrum, he arranged with a kins- man that "in certayn dayes he sholde sende hym for to lyve for the sustenacyon of his lyfe" after which he shut the door upon the world without. "And the devylles came in grete multytude. whyche brake upp the doore/ And bete hym soo moche that he had loste his voyce and his herynge/ And he beynge lefte so sore hurte and wounded/ that the payne of his woundes surmounted all tormentes of mankynde." Fortunately his kinsman returned, found the saint unconscious and "toke hym on his necke and bare hym unto his house." Anthony revived after nightfall when all were asleep except his kins- man, and asked that he be carried back to the tomb. Again alone, after prayer he dared the Devil to do his worst: "And Incontinent was made a grete tempeste. that the hous was broken on al sydes/ And therin entred a innumerable multy- tude of devyles in divers formes/ Some in lykenesse of bulles. and other of lyons. of dragons. of wulves. of addres. of Ser- pentes &amp; scorpyons. and the other in dyverse formes. as of liepardes/ tygres. &amp; beres. eche of hem cried after his nature." But Anthony mocked them, confident in his faith, and they were powerless against him. "Wherefore our lord whyche levyth not his servauntes in dangeour/ Seenge the vyctorye of his goode knyghte saynt Anthonye/ came for to vysyte hym/ Descendynge as a lyghte in to his habytacyon/ After whyche lyghte receyved. all his paynes and soores were heelyd/ And his hous whyche was al to broken was Incontynent made agayne/ Saynt Anthonye knewe thenne that god was come to comforte him/ And began to crye/ 0 my god/ 0 good Jhesus where wert thou whan I was thus scorged all this daye Why camest thou not atte begynnynge for to heele my woundes and soores/ The voyce ansueryd/ Anthonye I was here/ But I taryed thy vyctorye/ And now bi cause thou haste strongly foughten. I shall alwaye helpe the/ And shall make thy name by renommed thorugh oute all the worlde/ The whyche voyce herde. He arros up and was more stronge and constaunte to praye god thanne he was tofore/ And he was atte that tyme .xxxv. yere olde" (St. Jerome, Vitas [sic] patrum . . . trans- lated out of Frensshe into Englysshe by William Caxton, Westminster, Wynkyn de Worde, 1495, fol. xxxiii v-xxxiv r). The details of Anthony's life were first recounted in St. Atha- nasius' Vita antonii. They became widely known when the Evagrian translation into Latin was incorporated into the Vitae patrum, and available to all through Jean de Vignai's translation of Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda aurea, where the Athanasian account appears in abbreviated form. The trans- lation appeared by 1348 and was extremely popular among the laity. The later popularity of Anthony's life and tempta- tions, subsequently embellished in literature and art, was not so much due to the high monastic ideal he represented as to the efforts of the Hospital Order of St. Anthony. Its attempts to cure the endemic gangrenous disease known as St. Anthony's Fire (ignis sacer; probably ergotism) resulted in Anthony's elevation to the position of a sainted protector, along with SS. Roch and Sebastian, against the plague and other mediaeval ills. As a result Anthony passed from the monastic realm to that of thaumaturgy and popular acclaim.

Summa theologica, question 114, article 4.</page><page sequence="2">110 THE ART BULLETIN It has indeed lately come to our ears, not without afflicting us with bitter sorrow, that in some parts of Northern Germany, as well as in the provinces, townships, territories, districts, and dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Treves, Salzburg and Bremen, many persons of both sexes, unmindful of their own salvation, and straying from the Catholic Faith, have abandoned themselves to devils, incubi and succubi, and by their incantations, spells, conjurations and other accursed charms and crafts, enormities and horrid offenses, have slain infants yet in the mother's womb, as also the offspring of cattle, have blasted the produce of earth . . . afflict and torment men and women . . . with terrible and piteous pains and sore diseases both external and internal; they hinder men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving . . over and above this they blasphemously renounce that Faith which is theirs by the Sacrament of Baptism, and at the instigation of the Enemy of Mankind they do not shrink from committing the foulest abominations and filthiest excesses. ... 8 The coming of Antichrist and chiliastic belief were equally widespread. Sebastian Brant's Narrenschiff devotes a whole chapter to Antichrist, whose coming was considered imminent: Der endkrist sytzt im grossen schiff Und hat sin bottschafft vss gesandt Falscheit verkundt er/ durch all landt Falsch glouben/ vnd vil falscher ler Wachsen von tag zu tag ye mer . . . Die zyt kumt/ es kumt die zyt Ich vorcht der endkrist sy nit wyt." The mediaeval tract on the Fifteen Signs before Doomsday was revived and printed to form popular reading in the late fifteenth century.5 Bosch's pronounced pessimism was undoubtedly due in part to renewed attacks of the plague around the turn of the century. The occult now played no small part in the mind of man. Terrified by his belief that the world might end at any moment, he read avidly the new, printed astrological prognostications, horoscopes, calendars, and almanacs. But there was no relief in the almanac published at Ulm in I4.99, in which Johann Stoeffler predicted the end of the world (in the form of a second deluge) on February 25, I524.- Belief in astrology was common. Leading universities, such as Padua, had professors of the subject on their faculties. Even Marsilio Ficino had more than passing acquaintance with the art; like all physicians of his day he was thoroughly versed in stellar doctrine. The health of the studious, and its protection, is discussed in the first section of his De vita triplici; the studious are Saturnine melancholics, and as a child of Saturn, Ficino con- sidered himself one of them. Saturn being the planet of the old, Venus was inimical to them; they therefore had to avoid things under her influence. The children of the cold and dry planets, Mercury and Saturn, were considered as inclined to genius, being driven by Saturn, highest of the planets, to study of the highest things. The Florentine Neoplatonists thereby elevated the saturnine type to a position which the type had not previously enjoyed in mediaeval astrology-- and which it certainly did not enjoy in the north at the same date. But Ficino qualified his belief by holding that the influence of the stars was confined to inferior objects; however, by means of 3. Malleus maleficarum, Trans. with an Introd. by . . .

Edwin Zeydel's translation (The Ship of Fools by Sebastian Brant, Trans. into Rhyming Couplets with Introd. and Commentary, New York, i944 [Records of Civilization, Sources and Studies, xxxvi], p. 334) gives a good modern approximation: ". ..

ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH 111 stellar rays the vibrations of the world soul were transmitted to the soul of man only if he had freed himself from all that is sordid and dissimilar to the celestial.' Pico della Mirandola, in his Disputationes adversus astrologiam epitomized and popularized by Savonarola about 1497, was the first great thinker of the late fifteenth century to castigate astrological belief.8 But the belief was already widespread, otherwise the popularization would not have appeared. Rulers of the era depended upon the divinations by court astrologers who used the astrological treatises so numerous among incunabula. Even the authors of the Malleus maleficarum, the German In- quisitors Henricus Kramer (Institoris), and Jacobus Sprenger, both cited in the 1484 bull of Innocent VIII, share the common belief in the power of the stars.9 As in Ficino, Christian resolu- tion is achieved by assertion of free will and the grace of God.'o Astrology was thus important in the belief of the average man, and by no means died with the era." Such ardent belief in astrology seems to have been a natural accompaniment to the pessimistic outlook of the age. Pessimism appears in Bosch's art in numerous ways, but most clearly in the reiteration of the theme of human folly. In the Death of the Miser (Kress Coll.), this theme (here based on the Ars moriendi) is mordantly presented. Unmistakable is the folly of man, who reaches for those worldly goods proffered by a demonic ape at the side of the bed, yet at the same time foolishly tries to accept the good offices of the angel pointing out the salvation to be achieved through the instrumentality of Christ's sacrifice. The theme of human folly recurs in the Ship of Fools (Paris, Louvre), and in the Garden of Earthly Delights (Escorial). Both works demonstrate the im- portance of the theme, but particularly the latter, wherein the conception of human folly is carried to its Boschian conclusion on the right wing: folly is sinful, and sinners meet their fate in Hell. Others have already noted that certain motives in the Escorial painting have been drawn from the Visio Tondali, that important precursor of Dante from the end of the twelfth century. It was very popular in the Netherlands at the end of the fifteenth century.'2 Bosch continually repeated the theme of salvation of a foolish, evil world through Christ's sacrifice. This is the subject of the exterior grisailles of Bosch's Temptation of St. Anthony triptych (Fig. I). The Taking of Christ and the Carrying of the Cross are equated with the interior scenes of Anthony's temptations. Anthony's elevation to a position close to that of Christ had been 7.

The earliest edition was published at Speyer ca. 1485 by Peter Drach (Hain-Copinger 9238) i the earliest dated edition at Nuremberg by Anton Koberger in 1494 (Hain-Copinger 9245), and by Johann Koelhoff at Cologne (Hain-Copinger 8244). Belief in astrology appears in numerous places, for the authors were quite repetitious: "In the first place, nobody denies that certain harms, and damages which actually and visibly affect men, animals, the fruits of the earth, and which often come about by the influ- ence of the stars, may yet often be brought by demons, when God permits them to act" (Malleus maleficarum, ed. cit., p. I 6). "... man is governed as to his body by the celestial bodies, as to his intellect by the angels, and as to his will by God..." (ibid., p. 35). "... the stars cause natural effects ..." (ibid., p. 39). "... the stars are a cause of human acts . .. ; there are two reasons why devils molest men at certain phases of the Moon [devils operate through natural powers]. Therefore they study the aptitudes of bodies for receiving an impression i and because as Aristotle says, the brain is the most humid of all parts of the body, therefore it chiefly is subject to the operation of the Moon, which itself has the power to incite humours. Moreover, the animal forces are perfected in the brain, and therefore the devils disturb a man's fancy according to certain phases of the Moon, when the brain is ripe for such influence" (ibid., p. 40). ". .. the power of Saturn over lead, the influence of that planet in other respects [is] evil . . ." (ibid., p. 87). io. Though astrology was given credence, it is curious to note that Astronomy, member of the Quadrivium, was definitely allied with the "Enemy of Mankind," all its works being either the works of devils or allied to themi ". . . also are those images which are called astronomical the work of devils . . . the signs and characters on astronomical images imply only a tacit pact [with the devil]" (ibid., p. 188). I. Shakespeare speaks of Romeo and Juliet as the "star- crossed lovers," and the constant choral refrain in the second act of Claudio Monteverdi's opera, L'Orfeo, centers around the "stelle ingiuriose." Astrological belief still lives on, for example, in the daily horoscope printed in contemporary news- papers.

I688).</page><page sequence="4">112 THE ART BULLETIN suggested in earlier northern illuminations of an enthroned saint impervious to demonic assault, but here receives concrete expression.'" Anthony, as we know from St. Athanasius' Neoplatonic account of his life, represents a type, the heroic most elevated soul, tempted more strongly than ordinary mortals, yet resistant to the fiercest attack upon his belief. It is in keeping with the spirit of late mediaeval symbolism that an identification of Anthony with Christ should be made, an irrationality characteristic of sym- bolically oriented thinking, a "short-cut" pointed out so clearly by Huizinga."' Bosch's sensitivity to the dominant aspects of his age results in their most lucid exposition in the Lisbon triptych. Moralizing in intent, the motives drawn from many sources, it is a pictorial attack upon popular superstitions (Figs. I, 3, 4). The left wing of the Lisbon triptych is an introduction- to the scenes of the central panel and right wing. In the center of the wing the unconscious Anthony is carried across a bridge by a layman and two monks. St. Athanasius' Vita antonii mentions only a single bearer, but Bax has shown that the source for Bosch's scene is probably a Dutch version of the Legenda aurea printed at Gouda in 1478 by Gheraert Leeu." If there is a compositional relation to the central panel, Bosch has departed even further in the left wing from the Athanasian account by representing an unconscious Anthony as being returned to his tomb-cell in the central panel after his, beating by demons. According to St. Athanasius, Anthony was unconscious on his return to the village and conscious when brought back to his cell. Anthony's elevation and beating by demons is seen in the sky above. One of these demons dives under his cloak in a manner found earlier in the Madrid book of hours of ca. 1480 by the Master of Mary of Burgundy.'" Hands raised in prayer, Anthony is bent backwards over the upturned belly of an outstretched, winged toad." A fox-headed demon emerges from under his cloak and beats him with a branch."8 In Bosch's earlier painting of the Seven Deadly Sins, now in the Escorial, a fox-headed demon holds a mirror for a primping woman in the scene of Superbia, or Vainglory."' A twin-tailed armored merman rides an open-mouthed fish to attack the saint with another fish for a lance. Now mermaids were equated in the Physiologus of Theobaldus with lying men who speak fair but do evil deeds, thereby destroying men's souls.20 And this figure is a close parallel to the goading soldier on the exterior grisaille of the Taking of Christ. The parallel is not accidental. Further attack comes from a winged catfish carrying a boat on its back. In the boat are a diving fish, a naked man seen from behind as bent double with his head between his legs, and several men who man the ship. One climbs the rigging to repair the broken mast. In a trailing dory another naked man is seen. He stands on his head to augment the erotic aura already created by the other naked figure.21 The boat and its contents have been convincingly related by Bax to illustra- tions of the whale in English thirteenth century bestiaries.22 Bosch, however, is not merely repeat- 13.

It relates that "sijn broederen" brought him back to the village after his initial demonic beating. I6. The antecedent cited by Charles de Tolnay, Hieronymus Bosch, Basel, i937 (hereafter "Tolnay"), pl. 127, is a highly Italianate early fifteenth century Paris book of hours (British Museum, MS Add. 29433, fol. 89). Bosch, however, is clearly following the established lines of Antonite iconography seen closer to his own day in the art of the Master of Mary of Burgundy (Madrid, Bibliotheca nacional, MS E xiv Tesoro [Vit. 25-5], fol. 191; illus. in Otto Paecht, The Master of Mary of Burgundy, London, I948, pl. 22b). 17.

Bax's explanation (pp. 33f.) of the two dry branches, seen underneath the toad, as symbolic of dissolute revelers seems unconvincing, as is his conception of the fox head as a dog head. I9.

ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH 113 ing an interesting artistic form but is reinterpreting it in relation to the black art of witchcraft. The key is found in the inverted figures."2 Below the aerial temptation a habitation is created from a kneeling man who lifts his arrow- pierced forehead to the scene above (Fig. 6). The woman in the window embrasure at the left of this strange structure is a prostitute waiting for customers. That popular moral treatise, the Somme le roi, tells us that prostitution is the ninth branch of the sin of Covetousness, or Avarice." A strange quartet approaches this sinful structure, led on by a mitred figure who gestures with a three-fingered hand to indicate the place to his queer followers. One, the fat bird in a monk's gown, may satirize monkish sins.'" Another is a stag-headed figure dressed in a red cloak, in itself insufficient evidence for considering this figure to be a castigated cardinal.26 Close to Bosch's own day and thus pertinent is the characterization found on folio I9v of the Ovide moralisi, printed at Bruges in 1484 by Colard Mansion; "le cerf cornu cest le diable plain dorgueil."27 The mitred figure symbolizes heresy and heretical belief, a branch of the deadly sin of Pride, accord- ing to the Somme le roi28 (to which sin the stag is also related, as in Mansion's Ovide moralis6). Behind and to the left of Anthony and his bearers is the fantastic form of a head with wings (a demonic face at the base of one), growing from the posterior of a high-booted horse. Armless, and without torso, it blows on a bagpipe through a long, thin tube. A jay is perched on its tail. Equally enigmatic is the arrow piercing the haunch, and the sword in its flank like a blade in a scabbard. Bagpipes blown by fantastic creatures are commonplace in drollery illustrations in fifteenth century manuscripts, while demonic associations with this idea can be found in a Hell scene in a Cit6 de Dieu manuscript in Brussels (Bibliotheque royale, Ms 9006, fol. 265v), where a demon blows on the pipes.29 The curious piercing motif, frequently found in Bosch's paintings, has a parallel in astrological manuscripts of Albumasar in the figure of the third dean of Libra (from the Persian Sphaera). One such manuscript of the early fourteenth century (British Museum, Ms Sloan 3983) apparently served as a model for Flemish astrological manuscripts of the early fifteenth century; quite possibly it was known to Bosch."' Above this figure appears a scorpion-tailed fish with a church tower on its back. A round shield at its side suggests wheels though motive power is furnished by grasshopper legs. Another fish disappears into its mouth, and this had led to the belief that it illustrates the Flemish proverb so well known from the work of Pieter Brueghel; "The big fish eat the little fish." Bax interpreted this creature in relation to its parts; the grasshopper or locust (only the legs are present) as symbolic of hypocrisy." But the scorpion also has the connotation of lust."8 By such a fragmented method Bosch's figure cannot be properly understood; detailed analysis of the several meanings 23. For a detailed analysis of this group, the group in the middle zone below, and the aerial riders on the right wing, see Charles D. Cuttler, "Witchcraft in a Work by Bosch," Art Quarterly (to appear shortly). 24. W. Nelson Francis, ed., The Book of Vices and Virtues.

See Bax, pp. 24f. His interpretation of this bird as symbolic of excessive drinking and excessive gossiping seems unconvincing. Further, the citation of similar motifs in works by followers and imitators is far from being convincing proof of their meaning in Bosch's art; it is, in fact, misleading and erroneous (see below, note 50). 26. Bax, p. 25. In the moralizing tales of the fourteenth century Franciscan, Nicole Bozon, an elaborate parallel is drawn between a rutting stag and a lecherous man (Lucy Toulmin Smith and Paul Meyer, Les contes moralists.

Other equally curious motifs are present in this work and are of a nature which would have had a ready appeal to Bosch; grotesque animals and birds with human heads, tritons conceived as fish blowing on trumpets, Neptune as the devil of the sea and the tritons as, "gengleurs, les avant parliers et les adulateurs et les flateurs" are charac- teristic. For an illustration of Diana the huntress with these birds and animals see A. J. J.

The correct interpretation may be indi- cated by the action of swallowing a fish while at the same time greedily eyeing the apparently edible ball dangling from the pole held by the little man riding at the base of the tower on the creature's back. The ball used as a steering device calls to mind the method employed by Alexander in the popular mediaeval account of his voyage into the upper air borne up by griphons. If the Boschian model in the Escorial panel be allowed, then Envy is the sin characterized by this creature. There a dog with bones at his feet eyes with greed the bone in the hand of a man leaning on the half door.88 Seemingly Bosch had both Greed and Envy in mind in designing this fantastic form. By adding a church tower to the back of the creature, he has alluded to the rapacity of the Church. Probably the motif was suggested by illuminations of battle scenes in various fifteenth century manuscrits de luxe, such as the Grandes chroniques de France, Livy's Histoire romaine, etc., in which elephants carry armored howdahs on their backs." The tail in this creature's mouth recalls an elephant's trunk to further suggest that beast as part of the artist's inspiration. Now it was natural for the elephant to have acquired symbolic meaning for mediaeval man. One is therefore not unduly astonished to find the elephant with a tower on its back considered a symbol of the Virgin." According to mediaeval lore it was "notoriously sluggish in sexual matters" and thus came to be associated with Chastity."3 The Physiologus says the female elephant cannot conceive unless she first plucks the mandrake from outside the gate of Paradise, then eats and offers it to her mate to awaken his sexual desires. The moral of the tale presents the elephant as "the proto- type of the ideal Christian spouse who will mate without sexual appetite, solely for the sake of offspring.""' Bosch's unvirtuous creature, however, symbolizes the very opposite of such chaste behavior as it advances down the path toward a dwelling of contraindication, a house of prostitu- tion. It is clear that in this sinful world Christian virtues are transformed everywhere into their opposites. In the background lies a bay dotted with sunken ships, past which sails a ship that has yet to meet the fate of the others. A flaming beacon stands high on the rocks to the right while a cross is seen in the plain below. Though interpreted as related to the Netherlandish proverb, "A wreck in the water serves as a beacon," with the flaming beacon assumed to be false and the work of the Devil in contrast to the true beacon of the cross, one hesitates to accept this explanation because of the insignificance of the cross in relation to the beacon." Below the bridge fantastic figures flank an evil cleric reading with obviously unholy enjoy- ment from a sheet of paper in his hands (Fig. 5)." They are approached by a funnel-crowned bird on skates with large head and sleepy eyes, a letter spiked on his crossed beak. The inscription on the letter may possibly be read as "oisuif" (with a reversed f), or "oisuy," variants of the modern French "oisif," lazy, thus symbolizing Sloth.40 In truth this is a lazy bird who prefers 33. Tolnay, pl. 5a. 34. According to Wm. S. Heckscher ("Bernini's Elephant and Obelisk," ART BULLETIN, XXIX, 1947, p. 158, and n. 20) the elephant entered the West in relation to Alexander's vic- tory over King Porus and his war elephants with towers on their backs. The coincidental relationship between the mahout steering Bosch's creature B la Alexander becomes striking. 35. Cf. ibid., p. I61 n. 31. For a relationship between ele- phant, castle, Dame Church and the Turk in the accounts of Olivier de la Marche, cf. ibid., p. 167 n. 55. The Turk, in Bosch suggested by the crescent on the staff of the three- fingered mitred man, is one of the attackers of the Fortress of Faith in the illumination on folio 3 of Alphonsus de Spina's Fortalitum fidei, Brussels, Bibl. roy., MS 9524, ca. 1470-1485. 36. Heckscher, op.cit., p. 176, and n. Io9. 37. ibid., p. 173. 38. Bax, pp. 3 of. 39. The identification of the middle figure as a bear (Bax, p. 13) is not convincing. The meaning of these figures is not clear. Their position under the bridge may have been sug- gested by the story told in the Malleus maleficarum (Sum- mers, op.cit., p. 133) of the exorcised devil who had remained within a man even though he had taken the Host at mass. When finally expelled, the demon obligingly explained how he had stayed in the man despite the swallowing of the Host. At the crucial moment he had hidden under the man's tongue; "anyone may hide under a bridge while a holy man is crossing as long as he does not pause in his walk." 40. Tolnay, p. 30, interpreted this figure as a castigation of the sale of indulgences; Jacques Combe (Hieronymus Bosch, trans. Ethel Duncan, Paris, 946, p. 85) turned the inscription upside down and made out the word "Grasso," a clear allusion to the trafficking in indulgences, to the paid-for right of eating meat in Lent and to the corrupt divines who wax fat on such offerings." To paint such an inscription Bosch would have had to turn his large panel upside down which is rather un- likely. Nor is it likely that he was trying to confuse the ob- server by writing, as Bax believes (p. Io), an abbreviated</page><page sequence="7">I. Exterior 2.

He slides into sin as did the unfortunate granddaughter described in Book vi, chapter 52, of the Revelations of St. Birgitta: "I slide ayene int-to synne as he that slideth vpon yse; for my wille was colde and wolde not aryse and flee froo tho thinges that delited me."' Birgitta's Revelations were popular reading in the late fifteenth century, several translations having been printed in the Netherlands.'2 Bosch here points out to his observer how man slides into sin by refusing to exercise his freedom of will to resist the Devil and choose the good, as had Anthony. Low on the left of the panel, a large-beaked featherless bird--with teeth--is perched on a gigantic egg. It is eating one of its young, while the remainder poke their heads out of the egg. The bird is close in type to a woodcock, or snipe, which has a reputation for maternal devotion."4 Again Bosch presents a contraindication. The action of this barbarous bird has a human parallel in the classical myth of Saturn, who also devoured his children." Such action is also attributed to Wrath, and indeed the two ideas are not inimical.45 Further, we know that late mediaeval thought allied the planets to the Seven Deadly Sins. Saturn, slowest of the planets in describing its orbit, was allied with Sloth, and it is significant to note that this bird is placed in a position of almost equal importance with the sleepy, slothful skater." Again we anticipate what is to be found in the central panel, where instead of an Anthony subject to demonic attack with dubious outcome, we shall find one triumphant over numerous temptations. The right wing of the Lisbon triptych presents temptations to indulge in riotous living (Fig. 3). These are related to the table at the lower left of the panel and to the seemingly naked woman emerging from the dry-branched tree in the water to the left of the saint. The round table is supported by two naked men, while a third, with draped shoulders, blows on an instrument rather like a trumpet except that it bends back upon itself. The table is half covered by a cloth upon which are found a jug, several fruits, and the two loaves of bread which had appeared on the ground between Anthony and his temptress in the earlier miniature by the Master of Mary of Burgundy." A demon emerges from under the cloth on the near side of the table as another appears on the far side, the demonic character of the whole setting being nowhere in doubt. The musician blows smoke from his curved trumpet, from which a sausage dangles incongruously.4" Though heavily draped about the shoulders, the trumpeter's naked body is revealed by a filmy undergarment. A similar figure draped only about the shoulders, and lacking the filmy garment, appears frequently in mediaeval art as an acrobat or jongleur. The filmy garment is found clothing the Imago vanitatis in earlier manuscripts of the fifteenth century.49 Bosch has combined the two types to augment his conception of Anthony's temptation by the deadly sin of Gluttony, adding thereto the lesser sin of Vanity. To the right of the trumpeter a naked man with his left foot in a jug supports the table with his left arm, while his right arm is supported by a crutch. There is an antecedent with demonic connections for the motive of the foot in a pot; however, it does not seem likely, if for no other protestatio (protio) in mirror-writing as a sort of hypocritical picketing of the saint. 4x.

The third naked figure lies on his back while supporting the table with his knees. Blood flows from a wound in his leg. In a gloved right hand he holds a damaged sword, no deterrent to a feline demon leaning forward to slit his throat. Clearly this is an illustration of the words of Christ from the Gospel of Matthew, ". . . all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.""'' The severing of Malchus' ear which occasioned these words is prominently portrayed on the exterior grisaille of the left wing, and by that prominence again demonstrates the external- internal relationship of Christ and Anthony."5 All belly is the fantastic creature to the right of the table whose feet in a single large shoe sug- gests a pig with both feet in its trough. Swollen bellies are of course an obvious symbol for Gluttony, and textual parallels are readily found for such an idea; Guillaume de Deguileville's popular Plerinage de l'tme presents such a parallel." Above the table of Gluttony is another temptation; feminine incitement to sin. A naked woman emerges from a draped, hollow, and lifeless tree while an old woman with an exotic aureole pours wine into a shallow dish held out by a lolling toad. One clawed foot grasps a filmy garment which covers but does not conceal the naked woman, thereby indicating that she is an instrument of the Devil. A catlike demon holds out a fish pierced with an arrow as two ape-headed demons peer out from behind the tree. The nude woman standing in the water may have been inspired by the story of the Devil Queen found in the writings of Alphonsus Bonhominis."' A nude temptress appears in the Valletta Ms of 1426; thus the nude female in Bosch's painting has a definite source in Antonite iconography. The impressions derived from the table, the figures, and the elements in the immediate sur- roundings, are suggestive in two directions: the first, northern in spirit, leads toward the famous block-book, the Exercitium super pater noster, which in the scene panem nostrum da nobis, shows three loaves of bread on the table (panem nature, panem gracie, panem glorie)," while the scene et ne nos inducas in temptationem presents a man at table being crowned by Pride, offered a plate by Gluttony, and flanked by a third feminine figure symbolizing Avarice holding a purse;"5 the second direction seems to be a protest against a renascent, humanistic spirit in which may possibly be discerned what might be called an "anti-type" of a bacchanal. Bosch's iconographic elements, however, seem thoroughly northern. One has no doubt that the temptations are not truly tempting nor are they meant to be; by no means are they to be enjoyed. Beyond the dead tree on the left 50. Bax, pp. 115, i2o n. 30. The motif employed by Bosch with demonic associations recurs in Brueghel; the protagonist on the barrel in the Contest between Carnival and Lent (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum) also has his foot in a jug. But Brueghel's figure lacks demonic connotations, a sig- nificant change which throws into question the validity of Bax's continuous citation of Boschian motifs in Brueghel's art as proof of their meaning in the paintings of the earlier master. 5 . Matthew 26:52. 52. Bax's interpretation of this (p. i15) as a sword dancer connected with Carnival cannot be accepted. His conception of the nakedness of the whole group as symbolic of poverty is clearly contrary to the frequent mediaeval identification of nakedness and sin, particularly evident in sculptures of the damned on the great cathedrals (e.g., Amiens, Bourges). Poverty was not a sin. 53. Swollen bellies characterize the gluttonous in Book ii, ch. 45 (cf Morton Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins, East Lansing, 1952, p. 232). 54. The dominican monk Alphonsus Bonhominis provided the greatest late mediaeval addition to the corpus of legends of St. Anthony when he translated in 1342 certain tales about Anthony. These translations, made from Arabic, at Famagusta, Cyprus, had wide acceptance and long life. The most popular concerns the Devil Queen discovered by Anthony bathing in a river. When properly dressed she discourses with the saint, in- vites him to visit her city, there shows him its riches, demon- strates her power to heal the sick, and finally invites him to be- come her husband. Anthony, overwhelmed by all this as well as her verbosity, declines, but she persists and attempts to remove his habit. This act he recognizes as truly devilish and fights her off, whereupon devils fly in from every point and the battle is joined. After several days of continuous fighting Anthony emerges victorious.

ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH 117 is seen a portion of a figure about to mount a ladder leaning against a dead branch; figures climb- ing a ladder are found in several astrological manuscripts where the children of a planet are depicted." In the middle distance is seen a porcupine, that common mediaeval symbol for the temptations of the flesh. Beyond and to the right of a reflective Anthony interrupted in his reading by these demonic temptations is a simple-faced man without arms. Placed within a device used to help children learning to walk, he gazes vapidly beyond the picture frame. A small jug hangs on the side of his baby walker and a child's pinwheel is stuck in his clothing. The jug, an attribute of Gluttony, indicates this is a castigation of drunkenness, which makes men foolish.58 This childish man turns away from the saint whose model he should follow to free himself from the foolish ways which cage him. In spirit this figure is related to drollery illustrations." The possibility that this and other Boschian motives have origins in manuscript illumination, either in already certified bestiary scenes or in the marginal drolleries so characteristic of earlier English manuscripts, and particularly Dutch and Flemish manuscripts of the fifteenth century, is so marked that citation of a specific source for a single motive is to be viewed with extreme caution; what may be accepted whole- heartedly is Bosch's thorough acquaintance with the art. To Anthony's right a lizard with a monk's cowl is probably meant as a comment on the sinful character of some monks. In the distance appears a walled town the ramparts of which are lined with an immense crowd watching a swimming man with sword and shield fighting a dragon in a moat. These elements still lack a satisfactory explanation."6 In the sky above a large fish flies by with a man and woman on its back. In the grossness of his form the foremost rider shows an analogy to the temptations of Gluttony seen below. Bosch's model was apparently the sole miniature in a tract against witchcraft in the Bibliotheque Royale, Brussels (Ms I I209). The fish, undoubtedly derived from the serra or sawfish of the bestiaries (from which Bosch had already taken the motif of the aerial boat on the left wing), was there considered to be the Devil. Now that prime heretic literally supports his followers." Bosch allied the heretical fish to the Brussels miniature or its very close family relations, and added an over- tone of Gluttony. Thus the right wing presents further temptations of Anthony. The table and its related figures adds Gluttony to the list of deadly sins seen so far, with overtones of castigating worldly vanities, and an illustration of the end awaiting those sinful fools who live by the sword. The aerial group is related to that sin with the danger of sorcery as an added element. Gluttony is clearly the basic theme of this wing. The central panel presents another (highly significant) set of ideas to augment those seen on the wings. Ostensibly the theme, derived from the Athanasian account by way of the Vitae patrum, is that of a kneeling Anthony too weak to rise yet able to taunt his tormentors to do their worst. But instead of taunting the fantastic crew surrounding him, Anthony turns to the spectator (Figs. 4, 7). His right hand raised in blessing, he shows his victory over the evil forces about him. The figure of Christ who has made this victory possible is almost lost in the shadow of Anthony's chapel. The Saint blesses with one hand, as behind him the temptress in her normal guise of rich clothing, her demonic character revealed by the lizard-shaped tail of her gown, offers a shallow cup of wine to two figures opposite Anthony.62 One, an old woman, reaches for it; the 57.

Bax (p. 122)-without evidence-considers this the city of the Devil Queen.

The proffered wine is seemingly the saint vinage made annually at St.-Antoine-en-Dauphine by pouring wine over Anthony's relics. This was believed to give the wine miraculous curative powers, and the liquid was given to those suffering from St. Anthony's Fire, the ignis sacer.68 Bosch thus not merely alludes to the story of the Devil Queen and her counterfeit of miraculous cures aided by demonic minions, but pessimistically shows how demonic power to counterfeit all human actions can even make mockery of the good works of the Hospital Order of St. Anthony. Now it is apparent that the lolling toad and the naked women in the water on the right wing are didactic reinforcements of these ideas. Behind and to the left is a group of figures whose origin and meaning has escaped the eyes of previous writers on this painting. Rather than the celebration of a black mass, or any other aspect of witchcraft, a comparison will show that the source Bosch employed (which determined the character of the central figures and the structure of this central panel) is derived from a different aspect of popular belief. Astrological engravings provided the artistic sources. Astrology has been mentioned as having played an important part in the thoughts and beliefs of men of the late fifteenth century; by the manner of its inclusion Bosch denounces that belief. Luna, cold and moist planet of the night, is dominant,"6 and thus responsible for the nocturnal aspect of this portion of the triptych. Indeed, quite rightly so, since Anthony's troubling visions and foul dreams came to him at night. At Anthony's back a young man, cup in hand, stands before a gaming table; he can only be explained in relation to Luna. The well-dressed young man is the gullible victim of the gesturing, pork-headed, owl-crowned conjurer. The conjurer is one of the children of Luna, who herself stands in yellow garments and with yellow face at the side of her child's victim." The gesturing sharper, who has a dog in a fool's cap on a leash, had been portrayed previously by Bosch in a work, possibly a copy, in the Mus6e municipal, St.-Germain- en-Laye." Though neither pig-headed nor owl-crowned he too is accompanied by a fool-capped dog. The conjurer's table is common in engravings and woodcuts of the planet Luna with her children. A Florentine engraving of ca. 146o shows such a swindler in fool's attire cheating a gullible public grouped around his table (Fig. 8)."' A monkey clings to his leg, the southern equivalent of the northern trained dog on a leash. Thus the motive of the gaming table with its connotations of trickery and deceit comes from a readily transported astrological engraving. Bosch has not merely copied the Florentine figures; their transformation is seen most clearly in the conjurer, whose pig head indicates a castigation of greed and gluttony, while the twin to his dagger and sheath hang on the wall of the room in which the sin of Gluttony is enacted in the Escorial painting of the Seven Deadly Sins. Gambling, according to the Somme le roi, was the tenth branch of Avarice, and often grew out of Gluttony."6 The relationship between pig and Gluttony is an obvious one, quite common in both earlier and contemporary art, where this vice normally rides a pig."6 Further borrowings from this same Florentine engraving establish it beyond doubt as Bosch's source. The Florentine double-arched bridge appears to the right of the temptress. Positive proof is found in the crimson color of the sleeve, a contrast to the brownish grey of Anthony's habit. 63.

A sundial atop a column beside the roadway above the double-arched bridge has been transferred to the prison wall, below which the Florentine swimmers and fishermen again appear. The diver at the right of the engraving has become the nude figure about to dive into the water at the right end of the prison roof. It is significant that the sundial appears only in this version of the planet Luna and her children; it cannot be found in any other preserved engraving or woodcut of the subject.70 Thus, Bosch's source was the engraving of ca. 1460. The prison is not exclusively derived from the Luna engraving; some elements are taken from the engraving of Saturn in the same series (Fig. 9)." In it a prisoner is seen behind a barred window; in Bosch the bird with a ladder over its shoulder (gallows bird?), and the ape riding before him on a bull seemingly repeat the idea.72 The mother and child at the corner of the Florentine prison have been changed into the weird woman below the prison moat, who holds a swaddled child as she rides on a rat. Her body ends in a tail to give her the aspect of an evil mermaid, and indeed mermaids were in ill repute in the middle ages, the bestiaries considering them as devilish instruments synonymous with sirens. The mermaid-siren with her sweet voice lulled men to sleep so that they and their ships were destroyed. Mermaids were equated with lying men who speak fair but do evil deeds, thereby destroying men's goods and their souls by such treachery." The motive is found in bestiary illustrations; it was sculptured at Strasbourg where a siren with animal legs holds a swaddled infant, and it is also seen in the north French Psalter of Guy de Dampierre executed between 1280-1297, where a marginal drollery on folio I79v shows a fish-tailed siren holding an unswaddled, but also fish-tailed, infant in her arms." It has been suggested that Bosch's figure with her child, and the grey-bearded figure behind her, are compositionally based on the type of the Flight into Egypt.7" This "anti-Flight into Egypt," which seems to be combined with an "anti-Adoration of the Magi," can be understood in relation to the prevailing belief in Antichrist.7" Parallel events from the life of Christ and Antichrist were illustrated in manuscripts of the fifteenth century (Fig. Io). Bosch has portrayed such a parallel in this group, a portrayal very much in keeping with his normal inversion of the meaning of traditional images. Other motives from the engraving of Saturn (Fig. 9) appear again in altered form; the butchered pig at the extreme right is seen at the far left of Bosch's central panel now hanging from the wheel at the end of a pole carried by a smirking, apelike man who wears a broken pot as a head covering. On the wheel itself is found a leg and blackened foot, perhaps a reminder of the effect of St. Anthony's Fire." In the foreground of the engraving, to the left of the kneeling cripple, is another motive transformed by Bosch. A monkish almsgiver squats beside his soup kettle while a recipient of his charity drinks from a dish: in the painting the temptress proffers the same dish to the grotesque cripples before her. Antonite connections in the engraving are even more definite; one of the Florentine beggars at the corner of the prison wears a badge with the T cross of the Antonite Order upon it.78 70. Cf.

The cripples of the engraving may have suggested to Bosch the curious combination of head and legs opposite Anthony.</page><page sequence="16">120 THE ART BULLETIN Still other engravings in the series provided motives. From representations of Jupiter may have come the thistle-headed hunter, bird at wrist, riding a metamorphosed jug at the right of the ruined tower. Such a figure on horseback, wearing a flat hat and seen from the rear, is ubiquitous in Italian representations of this planet (Fig. i i). " And the two hunting dogs at the upper right of the Jupiter engraving reappear at the left of the Lisbon panel as accompaniments to the armored and gauntleted figure holding a ferocious and fantastic animal by its wings. This red- stockinged man whose head emerges from the tree trunk growing from his shoulders, and who is preceded by these armored lap-dogs of unpleasant mien, is clearly Mars, the warlike planet.8" The horsemen of the Mars engraving may have been the source for the group in the water to the right of the ruined tower." Venus has already made her appearance in the temptress who strives to lead Anthony astray. An equation of Venus, Satan, and Sin, found in the Narrenschiff is here called to mind.82 The harp-playing, skull-headed creature riding a fantastic form in front of the platform may have been suggested by the harp player astride a wall in the middle zone of the Netherlandish woodcut of Venus of ca. 1467, a cut derived from its Italian predecessor (Fig. I2)."Y The hat of the third figure of the musical trio in the foreground of the northern woodcut reappears on the conjurer's gullible victim. The pommer (a kind of oboe) of the first musician has a square shape close to its bell; this may be the source for the creature behind the gambling group. The creature's nose is elongated into a musical instrument of like shape, from which emerge wisps of smoke."' The proximity in their Boschian reappearance of these motives from the Venus woodcut may be taken as further proof of their derivation from a common source. Now Venus is in the ascendant in Pisces, the watery sign of the zodiac. The prophecy of 1499 of the imminent coming of the end of the world was based on the numerous conjunctions in Pisces predicted for February I524.8" There is thus a further possible explanation for the numerous piscine shapes with evil connotations found throughout the triptych. The planet also makes her appearance in the monk and woman within a tent at the left of the onion tower. The loving pair in a tent in the northern cut of Venus (Fig. 12) has been transformed into a reference to the corruption of the clergy, indicated by the bellows placed prominently nearby. Such a loving couple within a tent had also been represented by Bosch as symbolic of Lust in the Escorial panel of the Seven Deadly Sins,86 while the wealth of the Church was referred to by a popular preacher of the day as a pair of bellows which only serve to kindle the fires of Lust."8 A crippled beggar with hurdy-gurdy at the waist is seen to the left of the gambling group. He is derived from similar figures in northern representations of Saturn, though in these the hurdy-gurdy is absent (Fig. I3)." That Bosch's beggar is evil is revealed by the little tail growing from the sole of his crippled foot, and by the longer tail of his coat.89 Other elements from astrological represen- 79.

St. Birgitta had a vision in which a demon appeared with a head like a pair of bellows from which extended a long pipe; ". . . &amp; I see that the fende stode on the kynges leeft side, whos hede was lyke to a payr of belowes with a long pipe, his armys wer as ij serpentes, and his knees lyke a presse, and his feete lyke a longe hoke" (Revelations of Saint Birgitta, ed. cit., p. 81). The "fende" had another aspect to the Swedish saint which Bosch might also have been acquainted with: "On the lefte syde of the kynge appered a fende whos hede was lyke to a dogg; his wombe myght nott be fylled, his navyll was open and boyled out venom, colowred with all manner of venemouse colours. And in ych fote he hade iij clawes, grete, stronge, and sharpe" (ibid., p. 7'). 85. See above, p. i i o, and note 6.

Astrological engravings, however, cannot be assumed to have furnished all the motives in the central panel."9 Unrelated to astrology is the man with a high-crowned hat at the front of the platform. Seated with his back to the spectator, this man stares at a severed foot on a cloth before him. Here, significantly smaller than Anthony, though closer to the spectator, is the blasphemer who had cursed the saint and lost a member for his impiety.92 Behind the gambling group a Negro servant, symbol of the heretic, carries a platter on which stands a toad holding aloft an egg."9 The toad has a long history of demonic association in art and literature where it is often related to the sins of magic and witchcraft.9' In relation to St. Anthony the toad had already appeared in an illustrated story popular in German incunabula of the translated Vitae patrum.95 According to the story, Anthony made his living weaving baskets to be sold to infre- quent travelers. One day, under one of his baskets he discovered a toad, which transformed itself into a beautiful temptress who with such a beginning obviously stood no chance of success. The egg also owned demonic associations, as is clear from the flying figure at the top of this panel. Further evidence is found in Book III, chapter 22 of Ficino's De vita libri tres: "... sicut &amp; ovum putrefactione vel adjustione sit venenosum unde nascuntur vel evadunt immundi quida[m], ignavi, tristes, invidi, daemonibus immundis expositi. ... ."" The egg was also connected with magic and sorcery.97 Bosch evidently had like ideas in mind. The grinning ape-snouted figure at the left of the panel, who carries a wheel with the Florentine pig hanging from it, has a broken pot as his headgear. Now the Somme le roi tells us that the wrathy man breaks "pottes, coppes, and disches."" Though he is not choleric at the moment, his associates leave little doubt of his identification with the deadly sin of Wrath. At the lower right in front of the platform two devils are seen, half in and half out of a large exotic fruit, while a procession moves from this shelter toward the center of the panel. Still attached to the stem of this fruit is a basket in which sits a small naked man with irate face, holding a sword over his head. Bax has related this figure to the punishment meted out for certain minor crimes, in which the culprit was either placed in a basket and elevated above the ground- where the crowd could throw mud or other missiles at him-or placed in a basket hung over logical manuscript in the Tiibingen library (Ms M. d.2, fol. 3 x9v, Hauber, pl. 8, fig. 11). The evidence unfortunately does not support the conclusion-too many representations of satur- nine monks are found without the T cross, as is the case with the representations from which Bosch borrowed. That Saturn and the melancholic were associated in the late fifteenth century is not questioned ("Saturn is a male planet, in the seventh sphere, dry and cold, though occasionally moist. He is melan- choly, partaking of the character of Earth .... He is dark and loves dark raiment he is pious and steadfast. . ... Among metals he governs lead; among temperaments, the melancholic; agriculture and old age are under his protection. The autumn is his season, his day is Saturday. . . . He is friendly to Mars, hostile to the Sun. He has two houses, the Goat by day, the Water-bearer by night. His life of ascendant is in the Scales, his death or descendant is in the Archer . . ." [Lippmann, p. 3]). A comparably suggestive association may be derived from the representation of the four temperaments, printed by Guyot Marchand at Paris in his Calendrier des bergers, first issued in 1491. The figure symbolizing the melancholic tem- perament (Male, . . . fin du moyen age, p. 299, fig. 163) carries a T staff like Anthony, and furthermore, has a pig as his emblem. The T staff appears in the Lisbon panels but the pig, for obvious reasons, does not. Pig heads are there em- ployed with telling effect to indicate evil, stupidity, and gluttony. Though it is clear from his sources that Bosch thought of Anthony as related to the planets and probably to the temperaments as well, it is not clear, nor is it anywhere evident, that he was dealing with melancholia per se. 90. The burning town in the background of the northern woodcut of Mars (Lippmann, pl. C.III) differs from the Italian engravings where haystacks are on fire; the former may have been Bosch's source for the burning village. The towers rising directly from the water in the northern woodcut of Luna (Lippmann, pl. C.vii) may be the artistic source for the ruined tower to the right of Anthony's retreat. 91.

A nearby donkey may have been included in the group because of its reputation for stubbornness, though it also had the symbolic aspect of Sloth.100 The procession is headed by the harping, skulled monster in armor riding on the back of a plucked goose with a sheep's face. Death, of course, is implied by the skull and winding sheet seen in the long, trailing cloth covering this fantastic vision. It is clearly allied to stupidity: "sheep's head," "plucked goose"--these are not terms suggesting sagacity. Bosch's moral is equally clear: stupidity, pugnacity, stubbornness, and folly; all lead to Death, and all are led by it.1o' Taken as a whole, the group constitutes a parody, or rather a Boschian castigation, of the vanity and folly of knights and their chivalrous ideals. Chivalry held up to ridicule in an inverted world is a frequent parody in the drolleries found in Flemish manuscripts even as late as Bosch's own day.102 Without doubt he derived his group from a manuscript illumina- tion depicting the sortie of a mounted contestant from his tent, surrounded by equerries, to par- ticipate in a tourney of love; with this he united the wall-riding harp player from the northern Venus woodcut. But the models received a drastic transformation; this dour condemnation of the conventions of courtly love and chivalric ideals takes place not only in a topsy-turvy world, expressed with morbid fantasy, but in a stupid and malignant one, full of perils, vanity, folly, and sin. In the water before the platform are several nautical forms whose meaning escapes convincing identification. Above these a devilish trio stands at the right edge of the platform. Pig-snouted and tonsured, a demonic priest reads from a book while two other demons listen. The book is not his, but belongs to Anthony. The motive of a demon with the book of the saint appears con- temporaneously in the art of Griinewald and Bernardo Parentino. Apparently of Italian origin, it can be traced back to an Italianate manuscript of ca. 141o.o' A rent in the priest's robe reveals a skeleton underneath, as well as Bosch's awareness of Italian iconographic tradition. The cowled attendant demons reinforce ideas visible in other parts of the triptych; the weasel-headed demon wears an inverted funnel similar to that on the skating figure of Sloth on the left wing, the other demon is stork-headed and his crown a nest with a single egg. The general outline of a further denunciation of corrupt clergy and corrupt monks emerges. To the right is a group of riders derived in part from astrological representations. The trans- formed hunter with a bird at his wrist may be a representation of one of the Seven Deadly Sins, for it was common in the late fifteenth century to depict them as mounted riders, sometimes armored, and occasionally carrying birds on their arms.10' Possibly this is a symbol of Superbia, or Pride, whose steed is Flattery, whose horn represents cruelty, and who is equipped with spurs. Such a figure-female, however-is described in Guillaume de Deguilleville's popular late medi- aeval moral treatise, the Pdlerinage de la vie humaine.'05 Other riders in this Antichrist group 99. Bax, p. 67. It is also related to the mediaeval legend of Virgil and the Roman princess (cf. the engraving of Lucas van Leyden). 1oo.

ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH 123 may represent other sins but exact identification remains uncertain. Somewhat comparable to the different levels of interpretation characteristic of mediaeval thought is the seeming relationship of these figures to the castigation of Chivalry depicted at the lower left of the panel. A tower rising from the water at the right of Anthony's abode is ornamented with scenes that Tolnay thought illustrated the triumph of faith over heresy."'0 Lowest on the tower is a dimly discerned scene of a hunter preceded by a dog and a deer. Immediately above is the scene of the return of the emissaries to Hebron bearing the grapes of Canaan, a prototype of Baptism according to the Biblia pauperum.0?? Above the emissaries an ape seated on a daislike drum receives the offerings of a swan, a kid or lamb, and a cow.'08 An owl, that popular mediaeval symbol of the heretic, peers out of a dark hole at the left."0' The worship of false gods is indicated here rather than a witches' sabbath or Black Mass, in which the Devil normally presided in the form of a goat.110 The worship of the ape (i.e., folly, which Bosch equates with sin) seems to symbolize the renunciation of "that Faith which is theirs by the Sacrament of Baptism" mentioned in the Bull of 1484 of Pope Innocent VIII. And the prototype of that baptism is found immediately below."' According to the Speculum humanae salvationis, the crowning scene of Moses receiving the tablets of the Law is a prefiguration of the Descent of the Holy Spirit, while the scene of the dancers about the Golden Calf placed at a lower level was considered by Tolnay as the dispersal of its worshipers, and thus a prefiguration of the Fall of the Idols.112 One must question Tolnay's conception of this crowning scene on the tower upon noticing that the figures are dancing quite actively and not being dispersed. Illustrations to Sebastian Brant's Narrenschiff seem to have provided the model for the dancing figures (Fig. i4). Brant had equated sin, dancing, Satan, and Venus: "Wie dantz/ mit sund entsprungen sy Und ich kan mercken / und betracht Das es der tufel hat vffbracht Do er das gulden kalb erdaht Vnd scheff das got wart gantz veraht/ Noch vil er mit zzu wegen bringt Uss dantzen vil vnratts entspringt So ist hochfart / vnd tippikeyt Und fuir louff der vnlutterkeyt So schleyfft man Venus by der hend So hatt all erberkeyt eyn end/"1** Except for the hunting of the deer and the worship of false gods, the scenes of the ruined tower are taken from the Old Testament. Seemingly Bosch depicted not the Christian fortress of Faith, but the incompleteness and error of the Old Testament. Despite Tolnay's belief, the triumph of faith over heresy cannot be found on the ruined tower. As in the gradual destruction of the who is an armed man looking like a hedgehog (cf. the hedge- hog behind Anthony on the right wing of the Lisbon triptych), has a steel saw in his mouth and is as venomous as a toad (ibid., p. 418).

The ruined tomb and tower inhabited by Anthony (seen as though across the Nile, which explains the water before the platform) has assumed the symbolic character of the Old Dispensation. Unlike the earlier manuscripts there is no apposite construction to symbolize the New Dispensation. But the New is present, even though in affirmation it seems timid and even tentative. Almost obscured by its darkness, in the chapel behind Anthony the blessing figure of Christ stands beside the altar, upon which a single taper burns before a sculptured crucifix with the figure of Christ upon it. The blessing gestures of Anthony and Christ are identical. Here is the response, even before it is uttered, to Anthony's reproachful, "Ubi eras, ubi eras, Jesu bone...?" which came after the worst of the demonic beatings. Christ, both standing and crucified, is not so inexplicable as might be assumed. His appearance to Anthony, either alone, upon a crucifix, or on a crucifix held before Him by God the Father, is common in scenes of Anthony's temptations, though the event took place after the demons were dispersed and Anthony's dwell- ing restored. In so altering the sequence of events Bosch has again taken liberties with the account of St. Anthony's life and tribulations. Further, by replacing the heavenly vision with the earthly appearance of Christ, the painter has clearly expressed his inherent emphasis upon naturalism. It heightens the visual effect of his supernatural beings, good and bad, and particularly the latter because they are prominently placed. But in making the visionary concrete, his allusion to Anthony's later salvation by Christ results in the religiously most important figure being reduced to an artistically subordinate accessory. Owing to his insistent naturalism, Bosch's natural and super- natural worlds so interpenetrate that they lose their separate identities. Distinctions between his figures also tend to break down; despite their varied exteriors they have the same inherent mean- ing of evil. Anthony and Christ are the exceptions, but this fantastic world envelops them as well, and their existence outside of it is hardly conceivable. No ennobling act or attitude beyond the conventional sign of blessing separates them from the Boschian crew. With the crossed nimbus almost indiscernible in the darkness of the chapel, the greatest attention and therefore importance adheres to the artistically prominent figure. In consequence, Bosch has not merely elevated Anthony to a position of equality with Christ, he has unwittingly raised him to an even higher position. That Bosch was reputed to be a heretic, as Fray Joseph de Sigiienza relates,1"5 may be attributed to this and to similar artistic ideas. In the air above the ruined tomb two fantastic airships fly by. One mounts a crescent, symbol of the Turk and of heresy, the other reveals a decorative half-round device in its rigging similar to that on the staff of the goading soldier on the exterior of the left wing. The air is clearly a region controlled by demons, as can be seen from the devils flying to assist in burning the village at the left. A fierce fire rages. In the midst of it demons topple the church tower, possibly a warning of the coming of Antichrist.1" A woman in the foreground, unconcerned with the catastrophic events going on behind her, washes her clothes in the stream as a mounted procession crosses a bridge nearby. The sky above is filled with strange portent, and flashes of flame. A toad flies by on a winged egg, a torch at the end of the long pole in his hand. High in the sky at the extreme left a strange cavalcade is led by a gaunt demon mounted on a flying fish. Several horse- men with banners are dimly discerned through the murk; these are night riders, as Bax thought, but they have no connection with Carnival.1' They are horsemen of the Apocalypse come to visit their plagues and torments upon the livingi the ultimate cataclysm is near.

ANTHONY BY JEROME BOSCH 125 by Bosch, the leader of this aerial cavalcade, with a bow over his shoulder, can be recognized as probably inspired by the bow-carrying right-hand figure of Diirer's famous woodcut of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Fig. 2). " One cannot sufficiently emphasize the cosmic character of this overwhelming conception of the Temptations of St. Anthony. Air, earth, fire, water, heat and cold, wet and dry; everything on earth and in the heavens has its place in Bosch's synthesis of the beliefs and fears of mediaeval man. Astrology and the Seven Deadly Sins contributed the chief elements in this synthetic expression. All the branches of the Sins seem to have been given pictorial shape though some still escape identification.11' The present relationship between the Seven Deadly Sins and the Apocalypse was not neglected in mediaeval thought: the seven heads of the apocalyptic beast were allied to the seven sins.'20 Synthesis does not stop here; the apocalyptic element has been allied to Antichrist. And the planets too enter into this grand pictorial summa of mediaeval belief. Possibly Robert Grosseteste's Templum domini or some work related to it was the basis for the amalgam seen in the Lisbon triptych. Grosseteste had related each planet to a specific sin, and to specific diseases. Saturn was allied with Sloth, Sol with Pride, Luna with Envy, Mars with Wrath, Mercury with Avarice, Venus with Lust, and Jupiter with Gluttony."'21 Though not all the planets are in evidence in Bosch's work, there is a sufficient number coupled to the Seven Deadly Sins (and each of these has been represented at least once) to permit the assumption that such a synthesis underlies the iconographic program of the Lisbon Temptation of St. Anthony. This synthesizing attitude also governed Bosch's unification of the two major temptation themes into a single comprehensive form. It is further evident that he represented the Saint as prey to all those things which stirred and frightened the minds of his contemporaries. Fear of the unknown, dread of malignant powers beyond man's control, a debilitating fatalism engendered by belief in astrology, imminence of the ultimate cataclysm as revealed in the Apocalypse and the Fifteen Signs before Doomsday, daily enticement to commit one or all of the Seven Deadly Sins; these are at the core of Bosch's interpretation of the way to salvation through proper exercise of freedom of the will and invo- cation of divine grace, a way shown to all men by the "miles Christi," St. Anthony Abbot. Though under the influence of Saturn and thus predestined according to astrology to an unfortunate life, nevertheless he had overcome the Devil, had been victorious in contest with the Seven Deadly Sins, and surmounted the evil effects of the planets. Bosch's moralizing in paint is possibly as original as the form it takes. It is conceivable, however, that it stemmed from some clerical figure, such as Denys the Carthusian. His Quatuor novissima reproduces almost word for word the vision of Tondalis which Bosch had already illustrated on the right wing of the Haywagon triptych in the Escorial.122 Denys, last of the great scholastics, companion of Nicolas of Cusa, had tremendous influence upon his age. It is not unreasonable to suppose that his influence was at its greatest at 's-Hertogenbosh, near which he resided until close to his death in 1471. Unfortunately his writings on sorcery, magic, and heresy have been lost. These might have proved of immense value for a study of Bosch. But responsibility for the numerous combinations of ideas presented in the Lisbon panels must be attributed to collaboration with a scholastic mind steeped in the complex symbolism of the late fifteenth century. The heterogeneous elements suggest strongly that the painter has illustrated, has transferred to a painted panel, ideas literary in essence. Evidence for belief in a dictated literary program rises i 18. Willi Kurth, The Complete Woodcuts of Albrecht Diirer, N.Y., n.d., fig. 10og. 1x 9.

Almost none of the Lisbon devices appears in this latter work; the Saint sits in meditation unaware of the few demonic reminiscences sparsely scattered about. The striking fantasy of real and imagined anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms depicted with an overwhelming mass of naturalistic detail, enabled the Lisbon triptych to supplant all previous Flemish models of Anthony's torments. Bosch's unnatural yet material beings, pieced together with artistic rather than natural logic, were a perfect vehicle for his serious, moralizing exaltation of basic Christian ideals, but this forceful vehicle was too individualistic to achieve the same end in the hands of followers who in their imitations fell into the trap of delightful detail. Though Bosch denied the Renaissance by asserting a truly mediaeval spirit, his very indi- vidualism shows he could not transcend the rising forces of his day.
