<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> VISUAL ONOMATOPOEIA  Steven C. Dubin*  State University of  New York- Purchase  Social solidarity and group identity are not givens; at particular times they must be intentionally  cultivated and concretely enacted. What I have termed visual onomatopoeia assembles large  numbers of individuals into group insignias, emblems, or other significant symbols. The subse-  quent artistic or photographic record of such displays is tangible evidence of a group’s existence  -who comprises it and how it sees itself. It thereby operates as both act and artifact. Like its  verbal counterpart, visual onomatopoeia communicates through a close equivalence between a  subject and its representation. It frames experience in a distinctive manner by objectifying the  group, which ordinarily is only vaguely conceptualized. ”Living photographs” of religious and  patriotic subjects (e.g., 18,000 men configured as the Statue of Liberty) were executed by the team  of Mole and Thomas and E.O. Goldbeck between 1913 and 1971. From a Durkheimian perspective,  such images could be an important device for mobilizing allegiance. But by adopting a Goffmanian  perspective, we additionally learn that there is affective deviance from affirmative social rituals:  participants were not as fully engaged as their organizers might have desired. Additional exam-  ples from the mass media (e.g., advertising. news reports) demonstrate the metaphoric use of this  device and attest to the subtle pervasiveness of this way of representing social life.  INTRODUCTION  Is “society” real, or is it a trompe l’oeil image?’ We feel we experience its effects, but can  we actually envision and describe it? Many would argue in the negative: this is a reified  concept which transforms a process of dynamic negotiation into something static. But  some groups find that existential questions are frequent and vexing and therefore relentlessly  search for external validation of who they are and what they stand for. Just as is the case  with particular individuals, communal identity and purpose cannot always be taken for  granted. In addition, there are certain moments in any group’s history when its members  are more likely to raise such concerns. Crises and transitional periods can dredge up issues  that would otherwise remain submerged. Symbolic creations may fill emotional and  cognitive voids at such junctures, providing the reassurance and direction necessary for  continued individual participation and group survival.  *Direct all correspondence to: Steven C.

This is evidenced by totemic representations, the biologi-  cal and anthropomorphic metaphors proposed by political and social philosophers (society  as organism or “body politic”), or the commonplace geometric notions of societies as  pyramids of stratified layers or ladders of mobility. Ln all these instances society is seen  much like an everyday object,2 and its palpability can generate either veneration or  opposition.  This use of metaphor should not be surprising. It is a vital part of many aspects of our  lives, for example, in the enactment of rituals. Babcock (1978) vividly demonstrates the  centrality of not only metaphor in social life, but also the importance of irony, paradox  and inversion in how we express ourselves and what matters most to us. Others virtually  equate metaphor with ritual and culture: “Ritual is a form by which culture presents itself  to itself” (Myerhoff 1984, p. 155). Ritual therefore condenses important concerns, fre-  quently through metaphoric means. But ritual magnifies issues as well, and since it often  responds to contradictions which cannot be managed within the routines of daily life it  commonly displays a contradictory nature itself.  VISUAL ONOMATOPOEIA  The rendition of structurally important social arrangements and ultimate beliefs which  ceremony fleetingly provides the senses, still photography can further condense . . .  Goffman 1979, p. 10.  This research concerns what I have termed “visual onomatopoeia. ” Onomatopoeia typi-  cally refers to the written or oral realm, where words imitate natural sounds. Examples  would be “tinkle” or “buzz.” But this notion can be extended to a similar device found  in the symbolic realm-in advertisements, illustrations, and photographs-where people  mimetically represent group values when they are assembled into monumental images.  From one point of view visual onomatopoeia exhibits a remarkable degree of equiva-  lence between signifier and signified, materializing core values, lineage, group purpose or  social identity into easily grasped facsimiles. Rendered in a seemingly unambiguous  manner, this phenomenon is Homology 101. Such a stance would find support from  Durkheim (1965 [1915]), and from Peirce (1960) as an example of an iconic, motivated  sign. But from another vantage point we can appreciate that multiple meanings might be  extracted from such images and the exercises which they record. This more subjectivistic  view would square with Goffman (1961a, 1961b, 1963, 1967) in a sociological sense, and  with Saussure’s notion of the unmotivated, arbitrary sign in the linguistic sense (1959  [ 19151).  The generally accepted readings of the aforementioned theorists cast them into opposi-  tion with one another, but neither stance is adequate in itself. By examining the eccentrici-  ties of social interaction-visual onomatopoeia, for example-we are able to explore the  links between these respective points of view and develop a more comprehensive apprecia-  tion of social life.  First, consider the following drawing in an advertisement for a utility company (see  Figure 1). Here an ersatz emblem is presented as if it were formed by its employees.

First, the enormity and power of the organization is  captured through the incorporation of large numbers of people. Secondly, we are reminded  that they remain individuals and presumably are available to serve in a personal manner.  Together they provide a formidable force, but they supposedly don’t lose that “personal  touch” while literally standing for the company and what it does.3  Abstract concepts can be conveyed in the same manner as business principles. For  example, a graphic design accompanying a book review in The New York Times presents  an individual’s portrait with the component ‘‘cells” being other individuals (see Figure  2). Here the paradox of individualism is addressed: it is a condition that can be defined  only in relation to others. And finally, actual monumental photographs have been created  where extremely large numbers of people are arranged into formations representing what  is important to them as a collectivity. In these “living photographs’’-much more dra-  matic examples of visual onomatopoeia because they record actual events-religious and  patriotic themes have predominated: crosses, flags, and military insignias.  In each of these cases an ideal is presented: we are encouraged to buy, conform to, or  accept something we might be ambivalent about. A primary motif underlying them all is the  tension between the individual and society. Modern society has alternately been cele-  brated as the seedbed of individualism and deplored as its natural enemy, Or, following  Simmel, both tendencies are present, they are in tension, and each has the potential to  predominate. Two photographic practitioners of this monumental style best illustrate these  concerns, and their work provides the basis for the following analysis. The team of Arthur  S .  Mole and John D. Thomas initially worked in this mode in the utopian religious  settlement of Zion, Illinois to capture its spirit of communalism, and then operated on  military bases during World War I. These were both situations where the subordination of  individual to collective interests was paramount. And E.O. Goldbeck worked on military  bases throughout the Southwest from World War I through after World War 11, producing  similar photographic tableaux vivants.  This work straddles Goffman’s distinction between public and private pictures (1979)  in an interesting way. On the one hand, there was an anonymity to these aggregates;  individuals were expected to meld into a group formation. They were posing for a  purpose-as is the case with many other types of photos-and at the behest of some  director. But on the other hand, participants would also bring a history of social relation-  ships into the situation with them. The formation of these images conflated elements of  the social and the personal, the public and the private.  ANTECEDENTS AND AFFINITIES  It is impossible to trace the roots of such displays, but some interesting antecedents can be  noted. There is, first of all, religious imagery such as the “living body of Christ.” This  pictures the figure of Christ made up of the different levels of church membership;  superior positions in the hierarchy were accorded higher positions in the body. This image  predominated before Vatican 11, which democratized the Catholic church.  Providing a curious parallel, too, are the composite paintings of the 16c. Giuseppe  Arcimboldo. Arcimboldo used a variety of materials-fruits, vegetables, animals-in  arrangements replicating human physiognomy. As part of the Hapsburg court in Vienna  and Prague, he created allegorical portraits of the seasons and the natural elements. He  </page> <page sequence="5"> Visual Onomatopoeia 189  FIGURE 2.

There is also the procession gtntrale, an 18th century French parade which revealed  social strata and their relative order. As described by Darnton (1985), “It was not merely  aimed at some utilitarian objective . . . [but] existed the way many statements and works  of art exist-as sheer expression, a social order representing itself to itself” (p. 124). And  finally, these religious and secular displays have been adapted in more contemporary  times by the commercial realm. For example, a recent book cover featured a postcard  from the Piazza San Marco in Venice where an advertising campaign spread birdseed  spelling out the words “Coca Cola.” This was then transformed into a living photograph  of sorts by the pigeons it attracted (Haug 1986).  At least two similarities are apparent in the examples from the Catholic Church and  18th century French communal customs. First, these displays reflected status hierarchies  and thereby strengthened them. Each communicated a perception of the world that under-  wrote its “naturalness” and helped to freeze relations in time, much as Berger (1972) and  Goffman (1979) have demonstrated in the associated worlds of art and advertising. And  second, each exercise subordinated individuals to the commonweal, levelling them within  their “rightful” positions, and making manifest the physical contours and boundaries of  the group. Both these characteristics are shared to a great extent by the monumental  photographs of the 20th century.  Durkheim’s observation is aptly illustrated through the execution of these images:  “ . . . collective sentiments can be conscious of themselves only by fixing themselves upon  external objects, [and] . , . in this way they have come to mix themselves with the life of  the material world” (1965 [ 19151, p. 466). To a greater extent than is the case with the  examples of graphic drawings I have cited, this photographic work is both act and artifact;  the individuals involved were both participants and audience. Such exercises were designed  with two distinct motives. First, the moment of production: enacting the event was  intended to concretize membership and underscore the group’s purpose. Participation in  this process would literally provide the occasion to come together as otherwise atomized  individuals became critical units in the construction of community. In this sense we have  the photo session as a social ritual. In addition, we have the moment of reproduction: each  actor could potentially own a copy of the resultant photographs (see Benjamin 1969) and  at a later time examine and/or re-live an event which objectified typically amorphous  sentiments. While designed to record communal concerns, these photographs could like-  wise provide a memento contributing to communal spirit and heightening individual  identification with it.  The variety and persistence of examples of visual onomatopoeia through history boldly  underscore the power of this type of metaphor and its widespread comprehensibility and  appeal. In its photographic expression in particular it is forced to display a degree of  parsimony not necessary in other types of metaphoric expression, as in film, for example.  In the latter, meaning emerges from a sequence of shots and the juxtaposition of images.  In photographic visual onomatopoeia, however, there is only one “shot” to establish  meaning, which necessitates an extremely concise visualization. This is part of the general  limitation which obtains when using pictures instead of words to communicate. As Worth  </page> <page sequence="7"> Visual Onomatopoeia 191  (1981 [1975]) observes, “All that pictures can show is what is-on the picture sur-  face. . . . [pictures cannot] . . . do a host of things that a verbal language is designed to  do” (pp. 174, 178). But this “limitation” can be an asset, for a visual metaphor may  be compelling nevertheless.  THE DURKHEIMIAN LEGACY  [In social situations] . . . individuals can use their faces and bodies, as well as small  materials at hand to engage in social portraiture. It is here in these small, local places  that they can arrange themselves microecologically to depict what is taken as their  place in the wider social frame, allowing them, in turn, to celebrate what has been  depicted Goffman 1979, p. 6.  In his discussion of rituals, either those of collective deference (1965 [1915]) or punish-  ment (1964 [1938]), Durkheim’s main point is clear: they foster group solidarity.  Durkheim’s ideas rest on the necessity for individuals to come together with regularity, to  experience the group in actuality, and then carry away some reminiscence, be it mental or  material. From his perspective society might not be an empirical fact, but what social  groups create through such rituals-especially totemic figures as metaphors for the group’s  existence-most certainly are.  It is likely that Durkheim considered this a general social process, but he concentrated  primarily on “primitive” societies in his own analysis. And it is to those societies that his  notions most closely correspond. In Gerneinschaftlike groups, individuals would be  seeing one another with some regularity anyway. Rituals would be special instances, but  not too difficult to integrate into the daily round. In Geseflschaji societies, however, there  are the problems of population dispersal over a wider geographical area, a more compli-  cated division of labor separating individuals, and the possibility of different ideological  systems competing for individuals’ allegiances. Here integration is much more of a  challenge.  Some social theorists have minimized these problematic circumstances. Warner follows  Durkheim’s lead in his analysis of symbolic behavior and ritual in Yankee City. His  examination of Memorial Day has an extraordinary tone. Yes, there are divisions in the  society-religious and occupational, for example. And yes, they are reflected in such  things as separate organizations and separate cemetaries. However, these diverse seg-  ments unite in a moment of ephiphany in the annual parade, reaffirming core values and a  common identity (1959, pp. 248-320)4 Such rites are directly equated with primitive  ceremonies and rites (1959, p. 278).  Shils and Young proceed similarly with their analysis of the coronation ritual in Britain  ( 1953), emphasizing its integrative aspects. Again, cooperation and identification are  heightened, otherwise important distinctions which keep people apart are diminished, and  a generalized sense of communion is obtained. In addition, the specialness of the ritual  situation is underlined: “Surcease from drabness and routine, from the commonplace and  triviality of daily preoccupation, is certainly one reason for the exaltation” (1953, p. 75).  Other analysts have not been convinced by these arguments, however, and have offered  a more critical view from a social (Birnbaum 1955), social psychological (Klapp 1969), or  </page> <page sequence="8"> 192 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  psychological (Scheff 1977) perspective. The Durkheimian view has been judged as  coming up somewhat short in explaining the modem situation, at least in these instances.  However, when it works, and to the extent that it does work, ritual is still seen in  Durkheim’s ideal terns: “Effective ritual . . . is unique in that it meets individual and  collective needs simultaneously, allowing individuals, to discharge accumulated distress  and creating social solidarity in the process” (Scheff 1977, p. 489).  Ritual continues to be examined according to Durweim’s conception, but tempered by  the realization that a sense of “community” might be more limited and transitory than his  analysis allowed. Consequently, studies are conducted from a distinctly Durkheimian  point of view, e.g., Schwartz and Barsky’s consideration of the home advantage in sports  (1977). Or, expressions of group solidarity through totemic “residues” are examined  (Slater 1966). More typically, however, intensive interpretive studies are now undertaken  to discover either how rituals allow particular individuals to make sense of natural events  through cultural drama (Myerhoff 1984), how they help subcultural groups understand  and accommodate to a complex society (Hall and Jefferson 1976, Monod 1967), or how in  unusual instances of high ideological consensus in modem societies-the totalitarian  regime of Nazi Gemany, for example-ritual elements can provide vital support (Sontag  1980, Warren 1943).5  Artists and their renderings can help us construct how we perceive reality. As Baxandall  argues, artists in the fifteenth century provided the external visualizations individuals used  to develop and then continually validate their own internal visualizations of key religious  concepts. This enabled them to “read” what was important in their society with a “period  eye,” and helped to integrate them (see 1972, pp. 38-71).6 Although the worlds of  religion and art have become increasingly separated in our own time, a similar process  apparently exists, as more secularized concepts are portrayed by more independently  operating craftsmen (see Goffman on advertising, 1979). The artists I consider here  struggled with a dual concern: how to help insure a high degree of compliance from  individuals in “greedy” or “total” institutions (Coser 1974, Goffman 1961a), and how to  present an acceptable, reassuring image of those endeavors to a potentially wary larger  society.  Ritual can be linked with the visual realm through an interpretive examination of these  photographers, their motivations and operating rationales, the reception to their work, and  an analysis of the work itself. In so doing it will be possible to discover to what extent the  motivational weight and restorative power Durkheim assigned to rituals accurately charac-  terizes them in modem instances. The present task is different, therefore, from that of  many previous sociologically-minded investigators. For example, Christopherson (1974a,  1974b) and Rosenblum (1978) use sociological tools to analyze a variety of photographic  practitioners, their respective professional and artistic problems, and the over-all structure  of this artistic world. Sontag’s work (1977) is more aesthetically and philosophically  oriented, as is that of Barthes (1977, 1981). They have interpretive aspects, however, as  do Berger (1980) and Lesy (1973, 1980, 1982).’  But only Alloula’s 1986 examination of photographic postcards depicting “native”  scenes in Algeria between 1900 and 1930 undertakes a similar task to my own: a) to  interpret the presumed artistlsubject interaction in their execution and b) to explore the  meaning(s) of the photographs for their audience. This dual focus allows both the process  of producing these images and their social uses to be explored. The consideration of the  </page> <page sequence="9"> Visual Onomatopoeia 193  experiental and functional aspects is clearly most indebted to Durkheim, whereas the  interpretive task is informed by a reading of the “language” of these images along the  lines of Barthes (19811, Eco (1976), Saussure (1959) and other contemporary semioticians.  MOLE AND THOMAS:  RELIGIOUS AND SECULAR PRACTITIONERS  “The decline of religion,” John Berger suggests, “corresponds with the rise of the  photograph” (1980, p. 53). Apropos this contention, the utopian religious community of  Zion, Illinois was the site for what appear to be the first living photographs. A brief  recounting of its history will establish a context for understanding their execution. Zion  was founded in 1900 by the Reverend John Dowie, drawing from the congregation of the  Christian Catholic Apostolic Church he had begun in Chicago in 1896. It was intended to  be largely self-sustaining, although the manufacture and marketing of lace provided  contact with the outside (and a sizable profit). Members purchased land leases good until  the year 3000, when the millenium was expected and the ownership of earthIy goods  would no longer matter (Duis and Holt 1979, p. 116).  But all was not well in this Eden. Dowie and his earlier church were the target of over a  hundred lawsuits by disgruntled followers and their relatives (Duis and Holt 1979, p.  116), and a Chicago Tribune article headlined “Dowie Elder Mobbed” reported the  shouts of “hang him” greeted this man because of accusations of swindling and the  deaths of children in the community (July 22, 1900, p. 1). Dowie’s own fate sounds  disturbingly contemporary: he was deposed in 1906 after revelations of marital infidelity  and his possession of a $150,000 home. After he left the community went into bank-  ruptcy because of a $7 million dollar debt (Duis and Holt 1979, p. 118).  The religious heritage persisted, however, leaving an indelible stamp. There were many  prohibitions which closely regulated personal behavior. A ban on public entertainment  prevented the operation of theatres and bowling alleys until 1946 (Duis and Holt 1979, p.  119; see, also, Kusch 1954), and a passion play was mounted for many years. Much can  be learned about the community through the following report:  Faith healing was advocated by the church. This developed the idea that if one’s faith  was strong enough one would not die. In fact, people were not supposed to die in Zion,  but since they did, their demise was suppressed. No undertaker or undertakers’ [sic]  office or hearse was found in all of Zion in the early days. Such work was done at night  and many people just disappeared from sight. Today [1954]t here is one mortuary in  Zion, in the very southern end of the retail district. Kusch 1954, p. 53.  It was this community-tom by contradictions and sustained through restrictions-that  Arthur S .  Mole and John D. Thomas recorded and celebrated through their work. Mole  joined the community in 1901 and eventually became an ordained deacon (Fisk 1983: no  pagination); Thomas was already in residence as the choir director (Chicago Historical  Society exhibition card 1984). Their first known monumental image was undertaken in  1913 when children and their teachers (all wearing robes and mortar boards) were arranged  into a crown dissected by a cross. Dowie was himself later immortalized by a living image  in 1921 in celebration of the 2 1st anniversary of the founding of the settlement (see Figure  3). Homage was thereby offered to the group’s progenitor, whose controversial history  </page> <page sequence="10"> 1 94 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  FIGURE 3.

And in 1928 another religious design was executed, this of  a Christian crusader. Here the community looked forward to its current mission, aggressively  carrying the messages of “salvation,” “wordofGod,” “faith,” “righteousness,” “peace”  and “truth” to the world.  Quotes from the Bible were also enacted by community members. “I am the Lord that  healeth thee” (Exodus 15:26) is an example (no date). But such religiously-oriented  images make up only part of Mole and Thomas’s oeuvres. One seemingly secular design  executed in Zion in 1915 was that of a clock, with the living hands pointing to 9 o’clock  (Figure 4). Its significance lies in the convergence of religious devotion and everyday life.  A bell would ring from a tower in Zion every day at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Everyone was  expected to stop their activities and say a prayer at such time (Kusch 1954, p. 51).8  Somewhat in the manner of Renaissance images, then, such pictures provided a visualiza-  tion and guide to expected behavior, thereby linking the individual and the community  and fulfilling an important social control function.  Distinctly secular images dominated Mole and Thomas’s work during WW 1. They  travelled extensively to military bases throughout the Midwest and South, as a brochure  they issued advertising 13 of their works attests. Designs included patriotic symbols (the  Liberty Bell, the Statue of Liberty [Figure 51, the American Eagle), military insignias  from Paris Island, S.C. and Ft. Riley, KS., and real or putative leaders (President Wilson,  Uncle Sam [Figures 6 and 71). At the Great Lakes Naval Training Station (neighboring the  Zion settlement) they undertook simpler designs of messages such as “Vive La France,”  “God and the Right,” “Liberty” and “Victory.” In addition, during World War I1 Mole  executed three more formations (Huson and Rose, 1986, p. 37).  All of Mole and Thomas’s work demonstrates concern with providing inspirational  models and promoting group cohesion. Through their religious images they were boosting  their own community following the loss of their founder and the discrediting of their  mission. It was a time when internal cohesion was vital, given a hostile environment  conjuring up much different-and markedly negative-views of the group. Their skills  were then readily adapted during the war, another period when the mobilization of morale  was critical. In each case these artists orchestrated the creation of images to strengthen  individual commitment and to help insure group survival.  E.O. GOLDBECK: COMMUNITY ORGANIZER  Imagine the view of human society from the vantage point of an airplane . . . Structure  is recurring sorts of encounters. An imaginary aerial time lapse photograph, then,  would render social structure as a set of light streaks showing the heaviness of social  traffic (Collins 1975, p. 56).  E.O. Goldbeck (1892-1986) was not the only other person working in the living photo-  graph mode, but his work is the best known.g Popular evaluations of his accomplishments  -both contemporaneous and retrospective-have consistently emphasized the “Durk-  heimian” qualities to his work. One such account of a monumental photo executed in  1947 remarked that “Quite literally, each of the 20,000 men forming this living mosaic is  enacting the air forces motto, ‘Sustineo Alas,’ (I Uphold the Wings)” (Denver Post,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 196 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  FIGURE 4.

Similarly, an article surveying his  long career concluded that “There is an unwavering feeling of espirits de corps and epic  cooperation [in his pictures]” (The Houston PostlSun, January 15, 1984). An examination  of the man and his work will enable us to evaluate these claims.  Goldbeck had an extraordinarily long professional career, and one that was closely  linked with the military. He first photographed army and navy units in 1914 (Burleson and  Hickman 1986, p. 19), and organized massed human formations on bases from 1926 until  1971 (Burleson and Hickman 1986, pp. 43, 84). He regularly toured these sites and also  specialized in documenting the activities of religious, fraternal, and veteran’s associations  such as the Elks, Freemasons, and Rebekah Assembly. Not only did these groups provide  regular activities involving large numbers of individuals (thereby assuring a lucrative  market),” they also reflected his own personal interests and beliefs. He was, for example, a  member and active supporter of the American legion. His work was distinctive and well  known in the Southwest and on military bases, so much so that the following cartoon  appeared at his death: an angel questioning him at heaven’s gate exclaims “Let me get this  straight-you want to take a group portrait of everyone here?!?” (San Antonio Express-  News, October 29 1986, p. 4-B).  His living photographs represent the coalescence of a personal vision, specialized  equipment and techniques, and extremely diligent planning. First, these images obviously  provided more of a challenge than the routine individual portraits and squadron shots he  was often commissioned to do. But as Figures 8 and 10 indicate, what might look like a  straight-forward mimetic project actually required a considerable amount of intuition and  experience. In addition to being an artistic challenge, he strongly believed in using this  expertise on behalf of the military. For example, a letter from a commanding general calls  him an “old friend outside the service” and then continues, “I say outside the service,  realizing that you are about as closely identified with it as is possible for one not being a  member thereof” (letter to EOG, September 6, 1940).”  Second, he produced modifications of existing equipment and developing procedures to  meet the special requirements of his work (see Burleson and Hickman 1986, pp. 89-109,  and Davenport 1981, pp. 133-155 for detailed discussions).” And finally, the logistics of  executing this type of work were amazing. For example, to complete a photo of 20,000  men in 1947 (Figure 11) required the following: 6 weeks of planning, 30 miles of cord and  20,000 white markings on the ground to indicate the exact location of each participant,  and the construction of a 109 foot tower from which to shoot (McClure 1947). Detailed  instructions were also required for all those involved, including what to wear (e.g.,  contrast was generally accomplished by different colored uniforms).  A few of the instructions issued for one formation will provide some sense of the  advance planning that was undertaken:  11. d. WHITE UNIFORM: Will be white civilian shirts with collar (caps may be worn  but will be removed before photographs are made), khaki breaches . . . but no  neckties, shirts to be fully buttoned. . . . in the event some organization commanders  cannot present their command so equipped, men in white are authorized to wear white  issue undershirts without alterations of any kind.  12. Men should be sized in the formation, in so far is possible considering the  restrictions existing regarding their positions, but in any event, exceptionally short  men should not be placed beside exceptionally tall men.  (Memo from camp chief of staff, March 28, 1932).  </page> <page sequence="17"> Visual Onomatopoeia 201  FIGURE 8.  This diagram demonstrates the elaborate planning preceding each “living photograph.”  Drawn to replicate the Taro Leaf emblem of the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii in May, 1926, it was  necessary to compensate for the massive distortion caused by shooting photographs from a tower  high above the formation. For example, the distance between men in the front ranks was 16 inches,  whereas the distance between men at the rear was 16 feet. More than 90% of the 8500 men are  located in the upper half of the design.

Photography  collection, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Visual Onomatopoeia 205  The result was a high degree of clarity of individual faces (Goldbeck claimed every  individual could be seen distinctly in the Lackland photo), and maximum efficiency. The  Taro Leaf insignia of the Hawaiian division-typical of Goldbeck’s monumental work  -was executed in forty three minutes (letter from EOG, nd 1927).  Morale is the watchword for this work; it is alluded to in Goldbeck’s own statements,  the official views of commanders, and by the testimony of family members of participants.  While of course interested in the successful marketing of a product, Goldbeck made his  pitch in terms of the value of a picture as a relic recording the individual’s experiences:  “The [panoramic] picture came out very well, and I am sure you will be mighty proud to  be the owner of one for many years to come when it will bring back many a hard, easy,  tearful and laughing moment” (form letter, December 21, 1943).  The concern with morale was evident in several distinct ways, First, within the military,  those in charge judged these photographs to be directly related to espirits de corps. For  example, early in Goldbeck’s career a base commander testified “ . . . the possession of  these photos by the enlisted personnel of this command should be encouraged both as an  aid to morale and as a memento of the organization . . . ” (memo, June 25, 1929). This  remained typical of official sentiments, as the following attests: “Needless to say the  photographs were invaluable to the morale of the servicemen, and certainly it [sic] is a  tangible possession they will treasure in the future. The expeditious manner in which you  performed the actual photography was astounding’ ’ (letter from commanding general,  March 27 1950). Both of these accounts underscore the value of having a concrete group  experience and then preserving it. These commanders assumed the importance of this  “society” was thereby revealed to their men and their attachment to it would be strengthened  henceforth.  Similar testimony from family members suggests a second morale function: cultivating  and maintaining support outside the military. For those on the “home front,” these  pictures might alleviate the anxiety of separation and mollify concern: “My hubby was in  that picture . . . [and] I am very anxious to have it. My husband can be seen very clearly in  the picutre, and being he is overseas now, I’d be so happy to have a picture of him and his  division” (letter, December 31 1943). The picture is doubly meaningful in this case: the  individual is distinctly shown, but is also surrounded by his division. The personal  connection is established yet he is not seen as being alone (or, presumably, vulnerable).  Finally, a favorable image could increase the military’s attractiveness and potentially  contribute to recruitment efforts. This was an additional angle Goldbeck himself developed  to solicit further photo opportunities: “A million dollars, or several million dollars for that  matter, would not pay for such all encompassing publicity, no doubt the greatest amount  of favorable notice and acclaim the Air Force has ever received at one time. How many  young men have been directly influenced into enlisting into the Air Force is, of course,  difficult to estimate accurately, but it is certainly not an unreasonable assumption that out  of the many millions who saw reproductions of this eye arresting publicity, many thou-  sands were favorably impressed” (EOG to base commander, January 23 1948)  The consensus of all this testimony is that these living photographs were, indeed, a  valuable adjunct to the building of community and the maintenance of commitment in  several realms. Durkheim would undoubtedly be pleased if he were to examine this  material. However, his approach would accept these visual illusions from the outside, that  is, without much consideration of the participants’ point of view and actual response. A  </page> <page sequence="22"> 206 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  closer analysis of other evidence reveals a disjuncture between purpose and outcome,  however, and raises additional important issues.  WHEN RITUAL FOUNDERS  Perhaps there are times when an individual does mqch up and down like a wooden  soldier, tightly rolled up in a particular role. It is true that here and there we can pounce  on a moment when an individual sits fully astride a single role, head erect, eyes front,  but the next moment the picture is shattered into many pieces and the individual  divides into different persons holding the ties of different spheres of life . . .  (Goffman 1961b. p. 143)  There is not one privileged position from which to view this body of work; when the  observer alters his vantage point, a different social topography emerges. So if we question  what we may have taken for granted until now, we can appreciate a critical paradox: the  morale building effects of these exercises and photographic rememberances are not actu-  ally corroborated by the rank and file participants.  While the intentions of those who sponsored visual onomatopoetic exercises may have  been to bring people together to fortify their sense of group allegiance, what actually  transpired was both more complicated and more ambiguous. These dramatizations appear  to be coherent, self-contained statements, but like other forms of social interaction they  fall apart in certain respects when they are scrutinized closely (Garfinkel 1967). One  indication of this is that although Goldbeck’s archive contains the most arcane material,  the men themselves are curiously silent about this being important to them. However, the  presence of many examples of reminder letters sent to those who did not pay for and pick  up their picture orders are clear indications that compliance to the ritual of symbol making  and community building did not guarantee increased cohesion or on-going support.  Goldbeck used a combination of approaches to encourage purchases, viz., the following:  “The paper shortage . . . is far worse now than during the War; consequently we have  only been able to take care of but a fraction of the orders so far received for our recently  made . . . wonderful telephoto birdseye view of Lackland Air Base [San Antonio, TX].  Believe it or not, but you are one of the fortunate few whose order we have been able to  fill” (form letter, August 23 1947). And if this type of appeal didn’t spur a response,  perhaps another might: “We know that these photographs will become truly invaluable as  the years go on and that you would not take many times the amount you are paying for  them a few years from now” (form letter, July 31, 1944). In each instance the individual  was encouraged to recognize an importance which had theretofore escaped him.  This was a significant problem. In fact, the Lackland photo (Figure 11 )-considered by  many to be Goldbeck’s triumph in the living photo format-was reprinted in the media  world-wide, but was not received so enthusiastically by its participants.13 Taken in late  July, 1947, only 25% of the print orders were paid for two months later, much to  Goldbeck’s dismay (letter to commanding general, September 23, 1947). And there  continued to be a poor rate of return on this project, which prompted additional complaint:  . . . having personally served our Air Forces in both World Wars and with three sons  serving this branch in the last War (one of whom [made] the most precious sacrifice  </page> <page sequence="23"> Visual Onomatopoeia 207  and contribution any family could make, [when he] gave the full measure of devotion  and did not return), it is our firm conviction that no man in the Air Force, young or old,  would knowingly welch, renig [sic] or try to crawfish out of such an obligation if he  were reminded to do so was not honorable and would surely cast a blot or shadow on  the fair escutcheon of his organization. . . . Isn’t it equally important, especially in an  Indoctrination Center, that all men receive proper moral as well as physical training,  and in this respect isn’t it incumbent on the Officers to set a proper moral example at  all times?  . . . Figures speak more eloquently than words; hence the present status of Lackland  Air Base accounts . . . clearly indicates the degree of non-cooperation.  Letter to commanding general, January 23, 1948.  What becomes evident is that there were different levels of involvement and vested  interest in these photographic ventures. For both the officers and Goldbeck himself, this  was a serious undertaking which should command full attention and respect. From the  former’s point of view, for the symbolic capital it could create; and for the latter, real  capital was at stake. For the participants, however, what was supposed to be an intense,  socio-emotional experience had to be rationally devised beforehand and tightly regimented  in the name of efficiency.  There is a great deal of irony in this. Goldbeck’s keen ability to reduce the time  necessary to execute such a monumental event in fact may have detracted from its  ceremonial significance. It is true that this would be a unique event for each group,  whereas it was routine for the photographer. However, it presents a metaphor for army  discipline in general as much as anything (see Figure 9) What was supposed to be a ritual  of affirmation and celebration provided little room for spontaneity and release, and thereby  minimized whatever sense of pleasure or special distinction the group might experience.  This was, then, a situation with an extreme division of labor. In this respect it was perhaps  ideally suited to orchestrating ritual in an industrial society, but not necessarily conducive  to developing spirit. I4  One might assert that these events were a break from routine (Burleson and Hickman  1986, p. 72). However, it is more likely that there would be a mixture of responses: awe  and respect could be counterbalanced by a sense of both freedom from usual situations and  obligations, and a freedom to act differently. For the gung-ho soldier, the first set of  responses would be typical. For others, however, some acting out could occur without  small deviations from prescribed attitudes and behaviors significantly disrupting the collec-  tive image.  In fact, this is what a close examination of the living insignia photograph from the 36th  Division, Palacios, Texas (July, 1926) reveals (see Figure 12). We can witness a range of  reactions to the situation here, from focused attention to self-conscious mugging, and with  some men shielding their eyes from the sun. Similar observations can be made in Mole  and Thomas’s work, for example, in a WW 1 formation of President Wilson’s face  (Figure 6). Here some participants can be seen scratching and waving, while in a later  formation some people are turning away from the camera and talking. Instead of capturing  an ideal picture, then, we have a microcosm of what could reasonably be expected in any  society, with the display of a variety of activity rather than complete uniformity.  This suggests a theme prominent throughout much of Goffman’s work. Instead of  taking role playing and social interaction for granted, he has alerted us to the many ways  </page> <page sequence="24"> 208 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 211990  FIGURE 12. A micro analysis of this photo reveals affective deviance from the situation. A  range of responses to the situation-not unanimity of support-is apparent. Photography collection,  Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin (detail of living insignia  of the 36th division).  </page> <page sequence="25"> Visual Onomatopoeia 209  these are tenuous ventures at best. With his discussions of secondary adjustments (1961a),  role distance (1961b), situational improprieties (1963) and misinvolvements and disen-  gagements (1967), he has consistently examined the gap between role obligations and  actual performances. For Goffman “Joint involvement appears to be a fragile thing . . . ”  (1967, p. 117), and “‘What’s one man’s overeagerness will become another’s alienation”  (1967, p. 123). Obviously, then, actors bring different motives and definitions of the  situation to any interaction, and we should expect some resistance and disaffection.  Inevitably someone will act differently from what is officially sanctioned. Goffman allows  for there to be important “breathing space” produced by the contradictions of a situation  where the individual can refuse in some degree-however small-to hand over the total  self.  Goffman is characterizing the affective deviant. This role is typical and expected,  although not normatively sanctioned (1961b, p. 115), recalling Durkheim’s notion of the  inevitability of deviance. There is something of a paradox here, however. Although we  are to expect deviance even in a “society of saints” (1964 [ 1938]), when Durkheim talks  about ritual he infers that everyone is reverential and observant (1965 [1915]). Ritual is  supposed to be serious, focused business, with even the celebratory aspects being obligatory.  We should not expect anything other than total involvement. But this visual evidence  suggests that in the contemporary world this is more ideal than real (see Scheff 1977).  These exercises had ritual attributes, yet participation in them was dictated from the  outside instead of being inner-directed. Individuals were first made to contribute their  bodies to a group effort, and then expected to pledge their souls as well. But for a portion  of them this process struck a distinctly discordant note, and it failed to activate complete  value consensus. To invoke a distinction made by Barthes (1981), each person in these  photos is a punctum, holding themselves in opposition to or in congruence with the  official framework of the situation.  There is an additional way that these photos can reveal the reality of society rather than  record a fanciful view. The 1947 Lackland AFB photo (figure 11) reproduces a fact  contradictory to the notion of community solidarity. Goldbeck typically used different  colored uniforms or different degrees of formal dress to provide contrast (see Figure 10,  for example). In the Lackland photo, however, he used black soldiers to create a dark  circle in the center of the design. These participants are restricted to a rather small area  and they are surrounded by those who are racially different. Individual soldiers were there-  fore literally integrated into the grand design of this group, but ironically replicated the  segregation policy of the armed services as well. There is no record to indicate whether  Goldbeck was making a self-conscious social statement or exercising his artistic judgment  here. However, this idealized formulation vividly drew attention to a situation which was  later remedied in the military.15.  These photographic exercises were obviously adjuncts to well-established processes of  military discipline and morale building. But it is important to note when many of them  were undertaken-at critical moments of pre- or post-mobilization, when there was no  clearly defined enemy to respond to, no immediate sense of purpose, and when collective  identity would therefore be more diffuse. When he returned to work at Schofield Barracks  in Hawaii in 1935, for example, Goldbeck found a different situation than when he had  been there in 1926 (see Figure 10): “There was a new tone to the Army. An undercurrent  of tension, tempered with a heightened level of anticipation. Events in Europe, combined  </page> <page sequence="26"> 210  SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  with increasing Japanese aggression in the Pacific, made the military uneasy” (Burleson  and Hickman 1986, p. 52). Poised to act but not yet mandated to fight, the army could use  reminders of what it stood for, especially when they graphically displayed its cohesion.  A similar situation obtained after the war. The Derroit Free Press printed the Lackland  photo in 1947 with the headline “An Air Force Rebdm Looks Ahead with Confidence.”  However, the accompanying text reveals a more complicated situation:  Though it should be in the prime of life, the Air Force,finds itself with two problems.  1-It has just “come of age.” The recent National Security Act made it an independ-  ent unit, no longer an arm of the Army.  2-It doesn’t yet appear to have the vigor to do the work cut out for it. (August 1,  1947)  Combat precludes the need for material proof of strength, solidarity or legitimacy. But  these are not givens in a noncombative era. The military intended the Lackland photo to  help ally doubts it had internally, and to display a united front externally. To address both  these problems they produced emblems to symbolically supplement other efforts. Socially  ambiguous times produced the need for an assertion of material identity, but the unen-  thusiastic reception accorded some of these symbols by those who were mobilized to  participate in their formation demonstrates that the photos were only partially successful  in addressing the men’s needs.  DISCUSSION: SOCIAL GROUPS OBSERVED  Visual onomatopoeia is not generally scrutinized closely, even though it provides a  convenient frame (Goffman 1974) for organizing experience. It highlights the problem of  how culture is represented back to the group that spawns it, an issue which has engaged  semioticians following Peirce on the one hand and Saussure on the other; sociologists  taking up a parallel debate in support of either Durkheim or Goffman; or in this particular  instance, those emphasizing either act or artifact. Neither position from these opposed  pairs of distinctions sufficiently equips us to fully analyze actual social occurrences, yet a  synthesis of these supposed differences holds the promise of comprehensive understanding.  Visual onomatopoeia is a ritual form uniquely suited for situations where social control  is of paramount importance. For example, the military’s entitlement to violence places it  on both the real and symbolic boundaries of society, thereby rendering it a potential threat  to those it is mandated to servei. In times of pre- and post-mobilization it is all geared up  with nowhere (outside) to go. Here visual onomatopoeia would provide the opportunity to  exercise army discipline and reassure the public that the guardians themselves were  effectively under control. In an intentional community such as Zion this device also  demonstrated that members were disciplined and would defer to group demands. Its visual  displays revealed a structured society dedicated to a shared religious mission, not one  where individuals with dubious purposes would likely prevail.  Visual onomatopoeia makes visible what might otherwise be too inchoate to comprehend.  Its use assumes that we hold in common an easily-activated way of interpreting what we  see. For example, an illustration for an article on rising unemployment spelled out  ‘ ‘Reaganomics” by picturing individuals pouring from an unemployment office and  </page> <page sequence="27"> Visual Onomatopoeia 211   forming the phrase with their bodies (Newsweek January 18, 1982, p. 25). The common  complaint that statistics obscure the individual case (and in this situation, individual  misery) was mediated by use of this device, while both the individual and collective  dimensions of the problem were highlighted. Similarly, a participant in an antinuclear  protest observed “ ‘With all the support for the Thatcher Government, sometimes you feel  you might as well give up,’ said Cressida Evans, a University of London student who was  among 20,000 people who sat on the grass to form a giant human peace symbol. ‘Then  you come to see something like this, and you see all these thousands of people”’ (The  New York Times, October 27, 1985, p. 3).  This example not only attests to the regeneration of individual morale, but the event  also provided evidence of the existence and potential strength of this typically unmoblized  group. To reiterate a statement from the introduction of this article, it illustrates that  “Ritual is a form by which culture presents itself to itself” Myerhoff 1984, p. 155).  Protest organizers did not manufacture this cultural form by themselves, but drew upon a  familiar way of representing ideas and confirming identities.  Visual onomatopoeia in this particular case was used for oppositional purposes,’6 demon-  strating that postmodern society, rather than necessarily eviscerating vital social forms  and presenting hollow spectacles (see Dubord 1977), can in fact draw upon long-standing  forms of expression to critically assail present social conditions. Admittedly, however,  the bulk of examples presented here affirm “conventional” values and activities, mixing  Durkheimian concerns with high-camp style. Instances such as the formations executed  during football game half-times are much more common. In a variety of circumstances a  similar intent is evident. Within the normative guidelines of contests, displays of visual  onomatopoeia can mobilize support against the opponents. It helps to delineate the “us”  from the “them.” In situations of real external threats to an entire society-in war time,  for example-such displays can also rally individuals to the cause, heightening the sense  of common identity and justifying the subordination of individual to collective concerns.  Similarly, when such threats are anticipated, visual onomatopoeia could quell doubts  about group strength and individual responsibilities. And the situation would be much the  same after the culmination of conflicts, where the assessment of past sacrifices and current  abilities would be critical.  Likewise, conditions internal to social groups which threaten the continued identifica-  tion and contributions of their members could also generate such displays. These would  trigger a coded message that something persists over time and over and above the individual,  despite immediate problems. In such cases, visual onomatopoeia would be somewhat  diversionary, downplaying what might potentially draw away the allegiance of individuals.  It is an important ritual device for liminal occasions many social groups routinely  experience. But whether the situation where visual onomatopoeia is employed is one of  affirmation or defiance, the relationships between individuals and groups and groups to  one another are dramatically addressed.  The variety of examples I have cited lies along several axes which link them despite  their apparent differences. There is the axis of participation, ranging from voluntary to  involuntary, which also relates to the degree of commitment-high or low-both to the  group in general as well as to the specific visual onomatopoetic project. Paralleling these  features is the axis of “naturalness,” anchored by the poles of candid on the one end and  posed on the other. Here the degree of similarity to other communal activities is important.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 21 2 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  And temporality is another variable, ranging from ephemeral associations (the antinuclear  protest), to groups which are continually replenished with different personnel (the military),  to rather stable, on-going communities (Zion). The axis of intent must also be considered,  from the socio-emotional end (of more concern to participants and their leaders) to the  instrumental and/or commercial end (also important to leaders, andor artisans). In addition,  the intended audience can be restricted to the participants or extend to the wider world,  that is, this can be a private experience or a public pronouncement. And finally, the  public/private dimension can be configured in another way: the overriding concern of a  public emphasis would be the transmission of a particular message or the artistic design,  whereas a more private concern would dictate the clear portrayal of individual participants  within a formation. While it is likely that these characteristics would cluster in distinctive  ways in regard to different types of groups, the potential combinations are obviously  unlimited.  I have presented visual onomatopoeia primarily as a marginal phenomenon utilized by  marginal groups. However, it is but one example of the genre of memorial photographs,  differing from more commonplace family and small group images mainly in terms of scale  and elaboration of design. Photographic events both large and small enact and enshrine  social relationships in a memorial form. The photographic presentation of selves at all  levels-from immense communal clusters to intimate primary groups-ritualistically  dramatizes such central social questions as conformity, deviance, engagement, cohesion  and impression management.  What we cannot see or touch is often what is most important to us. When such concepts  can be portrayed visually-whether they be religious or secular ideas-we have a very  powerful and group sustaining metaphoric device. Following Weber, visual onomatopoeia  is one form of monumental expression in the modern world that taps the chord of commu-  nity and tries to raise it from “pianissimo” to a shout.”  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  Support for this research was partially provided by grants from the SUNY-Purchase  Faculty Support Fund and the New York StateKJnited University Professions New Faculty  Development Fund.

NOTES  1 .  Trompe l’oeil is a sight gag, a painting technique that tricks the eye. Woodgrain or marble can  be simulated on other materials, or murals might depict something that is not there, for example, a  wall of windows where none exist or clouds on the interior ceiling of a room.  2. And as Bronner further notes, we envision executive heads, judical arms, and legislative  bodies ( 1986, p. 157).  After I had completed this research, I discovered that Howard Becker had raised much the same  </page> <page sequence="29"> Visual Onomatopoeia 21 3  concern: “Many sociological concepts, whose meaning seems [sic] intuitively clear, would be very  hard to portray visually. . . . no one can be sure what an instance of status integration would look  like and thus no one can photograph it” (1974, p. 20). This echoes Freud’s comments on the  elements of dream work, where he notes the difficulty of transforming thoughts into visual images  (1977, pp. 175-77), and Sol Worth’s contention that pictures cannot do a number of things words  can, e.g., they cannot express conditionals, negatives, and past and future tenses (1981 [ 19751, p.  178).  3. Such advertisements. can entail considerable hyperbole, as illustrated in a promotion for a  French chemical and pharmaceutical company, RhBne-Poulenc. Their logo was pictured in a Decem-  ber 2, 1987 display in the New York Times, formed by stars into a new constellation. The accompa-  nying text stated, “Welcome to a world of constant expansion.” Not only employees but the  heavens themselves would seem to be under company command here. And an ad for Wadsworth  Publishing Company in the 1988 ASA program used a similar device, featuring a drawing with  people grouped into a giant “W.” My sense is that this type of representation is utilized in  sociology texts to address the problem Becker notes (see Note #2).  4 .  For a humorous, fictional account of the same events-albeit emphasizing their antagonistic,  competitive nature-see Keillor (1985, pp. 118-123).  5. Sontag’s analysis of the Nazi orchestration of public displays-as recorded in the films of  Leni Riefenstahl, for example-demonstrates the power of such exercises. What she describes as  “fascist aesthetics” shares obvious similarities with what I am describing: it “ . . . take [s] the form  of a characteristic pageantry: the massing of groups of people; the turning of people into things; the  multiplication or replication of things; and the grouping of people/things around an all-powerful,  hypnotic leader-figure or force” (1980, p. 91).  A particularly striking example of this principle is a living swastika formed by police units at the  Berlin Sports Palace in 1934 (in Wilden 1987, p. 292). An unusual feature of this display is that the  men are lying down in the formation. Their partisanship is accentuated at the same time that their  subordination to the principles behind the image is underscored.  6. This theme has been picked up by others: in the decoration of Jesuit churches in 17th century  Italy, “Attention must be concentrated exclusively on the [religious] subject of the frescoes, which  should be read like a sermon, more effective because paint lasted and words vanished” (Haskell  1980, p. 68).  7. In Michael Lesy’s popular work he utilizes an approach that is interpretive, but his 1973  work explores the luck of community as revealed through photographic evidence. And in his 1982  book he sees photos as “a ‘collision’ between skill and serrendipitous conditions” (p. xix), unlike  the purposeful acts 1 am examining.  8. One event in the 1987 bicentenary celebration of the U.S. constitution provided an interest-  ing parallel. At a designated time (1:30 p ,m, ,  September 16) people were urged to recite the Pledge  of Allegiance and the Preamble to the Constitution, “Wherever you are . . . near a radio or TV . . .  at school, at home or in the office . . . you are invited to join in ‘A Celebration of Citizenship’ ”  (New York Times, September 6, 1987 p. E15). Of additional interest is that both texts were printed  in full for reference.  9. Goldbeck collected living photographs executed by other practioners of the form. Although  they are in his archive, little is now known about these individuals and their careers.  Goldbeck’s own reputation has been increasing the past few years, and has extended beyond its  original boundaries. His work has been shown in photographic galleries for its artistic qualities, and  three monographs have been written about him.  10. Goldbeck’s expenses in making a shot were often quite high, but the monetary return could  be substantial as well. He claimed that his expenses (e.g., planning, tower building, supplies,  transportation, salaries, etc.) for the Lackland photo (figure 11) were over $17,500 (memo, January,  1948). However, more than once he sold $25,000 worth of work from one negative (Sun-Antonio  Express-News June 14, 1975, p. 1B).  </page> <page sequence="30"> 214  SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 13/No. 2/1990  11. This and all subsequent quotes from original sources are from documents in the E.O.  Goldbeck collection, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, The University of Texas at  Austin.  12. Goldbeck often worked in a large, panoramic format, as large as 10” by 65”. The Taro  Root picture shown here was originally 8” X 20”, and the Lackland AFB shot was 16” X 13”.  13. It was also blasted by the Chicago Daily Tribune which characterized it as an “ . . . utterly  useless, time-wasting, money-wasting enterprise . . . If it was the purpose of the stunt to prove to  the people of this country that military appropriations are excessive, it succeeded admirably” (July  29, 1947, p. 8). The basis of the attack was the misperception that staff time was used in the  planning and execution of the work. Goldbeck rebutted these charges, and his response was carried  in a letters column on August 4, 1947, p. 16.  14. Interestingly, Victor Turner (1978) emphasizes the obligatory nature of ritual in regard to  tribal or agrarian societies, and notes that industrial societies generally allow for more spontaneity in  ritual activities. This may not be contradictory to the evidence offered here, however, if we consider  the military and its form of discipline uncharacteristic of how most segments of society are allowed  to conduct their lives.  In fact, the necessity of strict discipline for such projects is underscored in a particularly humor-  ous chapter of the history of the fictional community of Lake Wobegon. In 1945 a living flag was  successfully completed, directly drawing upon the solidarity generated by the war’s ending. In the  following years, however, civic discipline eroded and the project failed as participants broke rank to  run up to a building roof to view the spectacle in full color for themselves (Keillor 1985, pp.  98-100). A Life article on Mole and Thomas makes a similar point: “In those days a command to  stand still and shut up carried a good deal more weight than it does now . . . ” (1971, p. 82),  expediting execution of these photographic exercises.  15. Segregation in all branches of the military was formally ended by President Truman’s  Executive Order 9981, issued in July, 1948. Prior to that time there had been separate units for  blacks and whites, separate blood banks, and a severe limitation on the positions open to black  servicemen (e.g., in 1940 all enlisted men were confined exclusively to cooking and meal service  details). In 1949 the air force opened all training possibilities and job specialties to all servicemen,  and by 1954 all Negro divisions had been abolished throughout the military (see Wesley, 1968, pp.  179- 198).  16. Other examples can be cited, viz., the formation of a cross by gay activists in the street in  front of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in NY to protest the Catholic church’s negative stance toward homo-  sexuality (Advocate, “News in brief,” April 12, 1988, p. 22), and the formation of the slogan  “NO CUTS!” by approximately 800 students, faculty and staff at SUNY-Purchase in May,  1989 to protest proposed budget cuts.  17. In Weber’s words, “It is not accidental that our greatest art is intimate and not monumental,  nor is it accidental that today only within the smallest and most intimate circles, in personal human  situations, in pianissimo, that something is pulsating which corresponds to the prophetic pneuma,  which in former times swept through the great communities like a firebrand, welding them together”  (Gerth and Mills 1958, p. 155).
