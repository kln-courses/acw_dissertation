<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND LITERATURE THE PRESENT-DAY CONCEPTION AND STUDY OF ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGY THE latest issue or one among the latest issues-in that long series of admirable books called the ''Bibliothecque de Philosophie Contemporaine" (Felix Alean, Paris) is Professor Georges1 Bohn 's "La Nouvelle Psychologie Animale." In 1909 Bohn published his interesting "'La Naissanee de 1'Intelligence," '2 in which he set out with characteristic French lucidity his position in the field of the new animal psychology, a position based at once on a considerable amount of personal observation and experimentation and on a thorough familiarity with the work of the whole modern school of experimental animal psychologists. In the present smaller and simpler or more general statement -by general I do not mean vague Professor Bohn restates with admirable understanding, restraint, definiteness and clearness, the conditions and the conclusions of the modern experimental study of animal reactions of the psychic and pre-psychic order. The conclusions, to be sure, can be held to be those of no other stdlcent than Bohn himself lnntil other stuclents give their formal adherence to them. But despite the inevitable disagreements about details, and the reluctance to subscribe to any man's dicta in toto, Professor Bohn's conclusions and attitude will find the adherence of a considerable body of animal psychologists. The essentials of this position are its strongly ''mechanical'' tendency, i. e., its attempt to make physics and chemistry and mechanics go as far as possible in explaining both stimuli and reactions; its strong leaning away from finalistic explanations, i. e., the explanations of adaptation and of Darwinian selection; its rather sharp classification into three separate categories of the behavior of the invertebrates less the articulates, the articulates, and the vertebrates, respectively; its conception of these three categories of behavior as standing not as three successive stages in one grand line of evolution, but as of marking three fairly disparate lines of development, that is, of differing not so mmuch 1 Bohn, Georges, "'La Nouvelle Psychologie Animale,'' pp. 200, 1911, Felix Alcan, Paris, 2 fr. 50 c. 2 See review by the present writer in Scien ce, Novem-ber 5, 1909. 574</page><page sequence="2">No. 5371 NOTES AND LITERATURE 575 quantitatively as qualitatively; and, finally, its sharp and clear conceptions of what is meant by tropisms, by differential sensi- bility, by association of sensations and associative memory. I have referred to the "strongly mechanical tendency" umani- fest in Bohn's attitude toward behavior explanations. This is not to aligii Professor Bohn with those representatives of the extreme mechanical school, such as Beer, Bethe and UexkuLll. Recognizing the great service of these men in showing "'the errors and the exaggerations" of the anthropomorphic or anthropocentric school of animal psychology, lie expressly parts company with them when they push their way to the rigorously logical-or is it illogical?-extreme. Bohn says: With the vertebrates the psychic activity acquires, thanks to the brain, a very great complexity. It becomes useless to speak, in their case, of tropisms and of the elementary forms of differential sensibility, for one can no longer isolate these elements from the total activity. The memory has reached a considerable development, and, on the other hand, the chemist has lost its primitive simplicity; each remembrance, each idea can provoke new forms of sensibility. Even with the articulates the "'rudiments of associative memory are developed to the point of masking more or less the tropisms and the differential sensibility." Thus by the side of survivals of the older or simpler activities, the articulates reveal new psychic acquisitions due to associative memory. For the behavior of the lower invertebrates, however, Bolin's explanations hold closely to those of the true mechanical school, those who rely on tropisms and differential sensibility. Bohn is highly appreciative of Loeb's pioneer work, the work that indeed marked the opening of the present epoch in animal psychology study. The originality and genuinely Bah-bhrechend character of Loeb's work is freely recognized. Indeed, the whole work and activity of the present American school of animal psychology is referred to and praised over and over again in all of Professor Bohn's writings. "La Nouvelle Psychologie Animale" has been "crowned" by the Acadenmie des Sciences Mlorales et Politiques. It may also well be crowned by that reading public which likes its science authoritative and yet simple and clear and interesting at the same time. V. L. K.
