<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meaning in Western Architecture by Christian Norberg-Schulz New York, Praeger Publishers, 1975 400 pp., $9. 95 The reviewer of this book is faced with a dilemma. Attracted to it by the fas- cination of the title, he finds himself confronted by an exhaustive survey of architectural history from łImhotep to Corbu'. So what of 'the meaning of western architecture?' The use of the word 'meaning' in papers about architecture is popular and often disappointing. To have mean- ing, an event or thing has to strike a chord of recognition or understanding in the person concerned. This implies a certain measure of anticipation. In general, people approach new exper- iences on the basis of their previous experiences. They hope to 'make sense' of a new event and use personal precedents as standards by which to gauge it. The meaning of a new event probably depends upon the degree of the relationship which it bears to these personal precedents. Although this book does not specifically deal with meaning in this sense, it is these kinds of insights which make it so interest- ing. For instance, in discussing the character of Egyptian building, Norberg-Schulz outlines the basic characteristics of the country. He describes the order and orthogonal relationships of communities and settlements along that 'longitudinal oasis', the Nile. The understanding of landscape and settlement was brought about by the experiences of the people and, hence, the buildings and architec- tural spaces, in order to convey mean- ing, were designed along axial, ortho- gonal principles. Norberg-Schulz surveys the 'history of architecture' following the usual clas- sification-Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Early Christian, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, Baroque, En- lightenment, Functionalism, and Plural- ism. A chapter is allocated to each in which the major characteristics of the architecture, the life and the times are introduced. This is followed by an analysis of the patterns of landscape and settlement. Then, 'building' is dis- cussed in terms of a number of examples. Indeed much of the richness of this book derives from its profusion of illustrations both verbal and pic- torial. Each chapter has two conclud- ing sections, the first deals with space conception and development, and the second with meaning and architecture. The 'Gothic' chapter provides a good example: the concept of dematerializa- tion through the use of light is dis- cussed. Light, from the very beginning, was the symbol of the meaning of Christian space. The concept exploited the spiritual potential of light and its alleged ability to transform natural and anthropomorphic matter. The achieve- ment of 'dematerialization' through the use of light involved the penetration of the wall, the exposure and recognition of structure. In considering the mean- ing that derived from these concepts, Schulz points to the conclusion of the 'age of faith'. Man began to wish to understand existence. The Gothic cathedral contributed to that fulfilment because it became a place where godly and earthly things could bè coincident- ally represented and discussed. Its order and dignity were both forceful and comforting reminders of the power and importance of the church in social structure. This exemplifies the way that meaning is treated in this book. It relates 'landscapes and settlements as con- texts for buildings and their charac- terizing articulation.' Architecture is seen as a concrete phenomenon rela- ting to space and time. Schulz argues that architecture is, therefore, con- cerned with existential meaning trans- lating natural, human and spiritual sig- nificance into spatial form. This it unquestionably tries to do, but how successfully? (The reason for intro- ducing at the beginning of this review a human, experiential approach to the nature of meaning itself is to question very pointedly whether architecture has ever really grappled with meaning at a level which would make it truly socially responsive.) To say, for example, that the columns of St Peter's (the mother church) sig- nify the arms of a mother reaching out to her children or that the contrasting linked geometry of Kahn 's Richards Medical Research Building represents a pluralistic dissatisfaction with the 'global solution' is to restrict meaning to an architect's cliche. This book deals with meaning in the sense of what the architect intended the building to mean. A study of what 'the building' actually 'meant' within the social mil- ieu of its location and function would be a more important contribution to architectural theory and thinking. None the less, there is written between the lines of this book a sense of a more socially applicable meaning of 'mean- ing'. This derives from Norberg- Schulz 's descriptions of the geographi- cal and social characteristics of each historical period. For this reason, it seems to be a good, basic text for history of architecture courses, al- though the language and discussion are complex.
