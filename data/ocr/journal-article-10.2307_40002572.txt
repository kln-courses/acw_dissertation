<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guide to the Year's Work In Victorian Poetry: 1978 General Materials Richard Tobias One-third of the text in Kingsley Amis' New Oxford Book of Light Verse is Victorian and much is surprising. We know Calverley, Gilbert, and Hood, but C. G. Leland, H. J. Byron, Godfrey Turner, and E. H. Palmer are not in Donald Gray's recent huge anthology. Even with Lewis Carroll, Amis takes us unawares with "Hiawatha's Photographing." Amis' witty, learned, and full introduction defines the form. He has only one woman - Phyllis McGinley- but Christina Rossetti's "The P.R.B." seems to fit his definition. Amis bifurcates poetry, and he reports much that is fresh and different, and worthy to be in a standard anthology. His poems ought not to be segregated, for they depend on what Amis calls "high verse" for their meaning and their humor. The separation is not his fault, since the culture has already done the damage, more's the pity. Amis collects forgotten popular poetry of the bourgeois, but three other reports disclose equally surprising working-class poetry. I missed Mary Ashrafs "The New Literature of the 1830s" (ZAA 24[1976]:22-36), and it should be contrasted to Martha Vicinus' 1975 Industrial Muse and Robert Colls's The Collier's Rant last year. Ashraf has two poets, Charles Cole, a London mechanic, and the tailor George Petrie, whose Equality (1832) was much reprinted. She quotes energetic lines about Sir Robert Peel's new police who add "to slav'ry's galling chain, / To guard more sure his father's blood-wrung gain." Ashraf is not in the slightest offended that Petrie writes Johnsonian dialect and heroic couplets. In part the essay is a polemic justifying two poets whom the author says bourgeois literary historians have ignored. Bob Munro in "The Bothy Ballads: The Social Context and Meaning of Farm Servants' Songs of North-Eastern Scotland" (History Workshop 3 [1977]: 184-193) discusses poems with more vigor and interest than Equality. The Scots inherited a better tradition than the couplet for their anti-farmer poems. Written in mid- 217</page><page sequence="2">218 / VICTORIAN POETRY century, the poems are the last coherent body of folk songs before the onslaught of industrialism and mass education, the bane of such poetry. Some of the songs come from inside female workers' experience. Malvern van Wyk Smith in Drummer Hodge: The Poetry of the Anglo- Boer War 1899-1902 prints "high verse" illustrated by Hardy's fine poems, but also a rough equivalent (in a quite different mode) of Amis' light verse. Little that is gay, ensouciante, or amusing informs the pro-war and anti-war poems, but the jingoists sometimes could get a bounce to their verse. The author, writing from South Africa, uses Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade" as a bench mark against which he measures the quite different poetry of the war. Some benighted souls did try to write abstract heroics, but even Kipling and his followers learned from Browning to speak from inside human feelings. World War I poetry, the author shows, had already evolved in the cultural transformation of the first English modern war that used common soldiers who could read and write. In the Vietnam War, we had high verse but not the music hall doggerel, the campy jingoism of Kipling and his successors, nor the pained terror of newly literate men. Because, unlike the Americans in Vietnam, the British soldiers had a starting style, van Wyk Smith's book too belongs next to a standard anthology. Jerome Bump's "Science, Religion, and Personification in Poetry" (Cahiers Victoriens &amp; Edouardiens 7: 123-137) rehabilitates the pathetic fallacy for the scientist who needs just such a model. Both poets and scientists model "conceptions] of reality, and to this end the more powerful the metaphor the better." Arnold fails with a model in "Kensington Gardens," Ruskin misunderstands the model, and Hopkins succeeds in "The Starlight Night." Frances Bridges Carleton in The Dramatic Monologue: Vox Humana (Salzburg Studies in English Literature: Romantic Reassessment 64) proposes to modify and supplement Robert Langbaum on the form by applying Schiller's play-theory and by applying our knowledge that nineteenth-century art tried to become music. Ben Knights (see below) cites Schiller; Langbaum needs to be added to and refined; and the notion of music has its appeal. The author has read much, but the chief value of the book is its summary view. Primarily using Browning, she considers briefly monologues by Alice Meynell, Tennyson, Arnold, and Landor, and she expands the form to include all Dionysian utterance from the chorus of Greek dramas to Donne. The greater need may be to distinguish the form. Much more necessary is Peter Allan Dale's The Victorian Critic and the Idea of History: Carlyle, Arnold, Pater. His thought constantly breaks over into questions of culture, science, and art. Dale writes with clarity and wit, and he distinguishes sharply between Carlyle and Arnold (he cites DeLaura's 1964 PMLA essay, which concludes differently) and their</page><page sequence="3">RICHARD TOBIAS / 219 influence. Dale's chapters on Pater and his Conclusion demand comparison to William Buckler's "Marius the Epicurean: Beyond Victorianism" ( VP 16: 147-166) as well as comparison and contrast to Ben Knights's striking and stimulating The Idea of the Clerisy in the Nineteenth Century. Knights adds Coleridge and Mill and touches more on Newman, and he regards "the form of cultural criticism derived from the nineteenth- century clerisy tradition as inadequate." Dale is less positive because he has faith in (good grief) Pater. Dale is concerned with value or authority, but Knights fears the baleful judgment or deference the system inculcates and thrives on. If art and poetry provide Dale "some form of absolute revelation about the true nature of things," Knights is much more skeptical about needing absolute revelations, and he is much more interested in applications to the curriculum and teaching in the universities. Since his final chapter modifies the past in the guts of the living, Knights's book threatens and disturbs much more than Dale's book. On a similar topic, Patrick Parrinder's Authors and Authority: A Study of English Literary Criticism and Its Relation to Culture 1750-1900 has even wider scope than Knights and thus his argument is less sharp and may be therefore less persuasive. Parrinder starts with Samuel Johnson, devotes a chapter each to Wordsworth and to the Romantic critics, and then concentrates on the Victorians. Again Arnold illustrates, starts, or corrupts modern authority in the critic and teacher. Parrinder has a rage for order, and he knows that literature has the force of ideology. These three books - Dale, Knights, and Parrinder - require a fourth sensibility to see how each diverges and converges on the single issue of Victorian poetics. Only Dale quotes much verse, but behind all three lies an implicit understanding of that poetry and its meaning in society. Future essays in Victorian Poetry might well apply their grand accusations and generalizations. Joanne Feit Diehl's "'Come Slowly - Eden': An Explanation of Women Poets and Their Muse" (Signs 3: 572-587) applies Harold Bloom's theory of the family romance in literary influence to E. Dickinson, E. B. Browning, and C. Rossetti. She invites further testing of her revision to other women poets, and the essay also suggests teasing thoughts to Kingsley Amis' reader and the question of why few women have written light verse. On another level of intensity entirely, Russell M. and Clare R. Goldfarb assemble in Spiritualism and Nineteenth-Century Letters marvelous and astounding details about spiritualists, about literary persons' response, and about the influence of the subject on particular works. Witchcraft left dark stains on our history, but spiritualism seems to have left chiefly laughs. What names they had! Professor Henry Kiddle, C.</page><page sequence="4">220 / VICTORIAN POETRY F. Livermore, Charles E. Shockle, Tennessee Clafin, Octavius B. Frothingham, Cora Hatch, Hatty Hosmer, and Mrs. Samuel Guppy sought to lead neophytes into a world of unified sensibility and sure authority. Sometimes - especially in their accounts of Daniel Dunglas Home and the Brownings - the Goldfarbs seem to be providing a synopsis for a Peacock novel. On first glance, the title of James Kincaid's "'Why Unblooms the Best Hope?' Victorian Narrative Forms and the Explanation of Calamity" ( VN 53: 1-4) and Kincaid's reputation as a critic of novelists would lead a reader to assume the essay impinges but slightly on Victorian poetry. His most telling illustration of the Victorian ability to combine affirmation and denial in one utterance comes from poetry by Hardy, Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, and Edward Lear. As always, one appreciates Kincaid's wit and acumen. George Landow's "'Moses Striking the Rock': Typological Symbolism in Victorian Poetry" {Literary Uses of Typology: From the Late Middle Ages to the Present, ed. Earl Miner [1977]) discusses the Victorian period for the book. Since typology differs from allegory, it may serve as an intermediary step toward late nineteenth-century symbolism. Landow offers examples chiefly from Mrs. Browning, Hopkins, Tennyson, Browning, Keble, and C. Rossetti, and he constantly returns to the centrality of Ruskin in the cultural transformation. Since the three books by Dale, Knights, and Parrinder ignore Ruskin, Landow supplies needed complement to them. Also Miner, in the "Afterward," cites two Newman poems as further examples of new study needing to be made. Robert Langbaum's 77?^ Mysteries of Identity: A Theme in Modern Literature (1977) might irritate Dale-Knights-Parrinder because he is of the clerisy writing for the clerisy. Arnold occupies a position between Wordsworth at one beginning and Eliot and Beckett at another ending. Langbaum concludes with 200 pages on Yeats and Lawrence, showing how they completed, denied, or reversed Victorian patterns. A quite different kettle offish is Colin Martindale's "The Evolution of English Poetry" (Poetics 7:231-248) for its computer analysis of eighty- eight poetic texts to establish a scientific theory of artistic and literary change. The essay can not easily be pulled out of the journal, which seeks to establish a new poetics based on computer information. Martindale's attention to language should please Dennis Taylor who in "Victorian Philology and Victorian Poetry" (VN 53:13-16) shows how language debates in the 1860's contributed to poems by Hardy and Hopkins. Taylor wants more application of philological ideas to Victorian poems, and more effort to apply stylistic theory to language and language theories to poetic works.</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD TOBIAS / 221 Geoffrey Tillotson's A View of Victorian Literature differs from every other title covered in this report. I frankly don't know what to say about the book. It was originally planned as a volume in the Oxford History of English Literature, and this manuscript was finished as a draft for that purpose before Tillotson's death. It was rejected for the series, but his wife Kathleen has supervised publication and added notes. He has an excellent opening chapter on the idea of history and time (so far, good), then a chapter on "Earnestness," and a chapter on Carlyle as a seminal figure. He next turns to the major early novelists - Dickens, Thackery, Trollope, the Brontes, and Mrs. Gaskell- and concludes with chapters on Tennyson and Browning. Although there is no Arnold chapter, the Carlyle chapter speaks much about Carlyle's influence on Arnold (contra Dale and Knights above). The book is in no sense a history; it has no central idea, no plan, no function. Tillotson is a radical nominalist teaching us to defer to Victorian figures. I would keep the book away from students, scholars, or Ruskin's celebrated working man. Tillotson pays no attention to twentieth-century criticism, but paradoxically the one redeeming feature of the book is his astonishing ability to find an apt phrase from a nineteenth-century critic. Harriet Martineau thus wonderfully describes literary lionization. Tillotson seems to have reversed his twentieth-century self into a nineteenth-century avatar, but the result will confuse readers by the same multitudinousness, class judgment, and historical blindness the Victorians have taught us were the very faults of the period. Maybe the moral is that no one ought to try to write literary history except to study a particular idea as in the Dale-Knights-Parrinder books, or to study a particular kind of writing as in van Wyk Smith's Drummer Hodge. I will close by recalling to attention the double issue of Victorian Poetry on "The Victorianism of Victorian Poetry." Since most of the essays focus on a writer or a work, I mention here only Wendell Harris' "'Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang': Looking Back at the Victorians Looking Back at the Romantics Looking Back . . ." (VP 16:167-175) and note that the sweet birds of Arnold's poem can not speak as birds did to the Romantics (see J. Bump's essay above). Harris' title almost states the thesis of the Dale-Knights-Parrinder discussions. Harris, like the others, focuses on Arnold as poet and critic. In recent years, attention to Arnold has declined; suddenly now he is all over the critical landscape. George Watson's Politics and Literature in Modern Britain starts with Arnold, but the book has less value for students of Victorian poetry than for students of modern politics. Still, it is thrilling to see Arnold a subject of debate. The only place where Arnold is not is Kingsley Amis' New Oxford Book of Light Verse; he did write some verse on dogs that might fit Amis' definition, and then we would have Arnold everywhere.</page><page sequence="6">222/ VICTORIAN POETRY Matthew Arnold Jerold J. Savory In his scathing review of Vincent L. Tollers' A Bibliography of Matthew Arnold, 1932-1970 (1974) and Carl Dawson's Matthew Arnold: The Poetry. The Critical Heritage (1973), R. H. Super observes the recently "depressing matter" of frequently overpriced photo-offset editions of older books that compete for librarians' "budgets and shelf space" (MP 76: 94- 102). While not all reprints necessarily fit this description, it is true that new editions of older books on Arnold are arriving by increasing numbers each year. Some of the most recent include Carlton Stanley's 1938 Matthew Arnold, Derek Kitchin's 1945 Matthew Arnold and The Scholar Gipsy, Robert Stange's 1967 Matthew Arnold: The Poet As Humanist, and Lionel Trilling's 1939 Matthew Arnold, now in a Uniform Edition after its 1949 New Edition, reprinted by Meridian in 1955. Appropriately, forty years after the initial publication of Trilling's classic, Tom Samet offers an article, "Trilling, Arnold and the Anxieties of the Modern" (SoQ 16: 191- 208), a review of Trilling's writings from the perspective of his "inheritance from Arnold," which Samet sees not so much as specific doctrines and ideas as qualities of mind associated with the humanistic tradition, especially "openness and flexibility." The article is worth reading, less for what it tells us about Arnold than for what it says about one of Arnold's foremost twentieth-century critics whose valuable book deserves reprinting. Reviews of Arnoldian research continue. T. R. Donovan surveys "Recent Arnold Scholarship" in The Arnoldian (Fall, 1978), an issue also containing a useful article, "Matthew Arnold and Liberal Unionism: Consensus and Discord," by Thomas S. Snyder. The most extensive review is by Sidney Coulling, whose "Matthew Arnold, 1945-1974: A Review of Criticism and Research" appears in British Studies Monitor (8: 3-26). Coulling acknowledges his reliance upon Faverty's second edition of The Victorian Poets: A Guide to Research (1968) and DeLaura's M.L.A. edition, Victorian Prose: A Guide to Research (1973). He also uses Tollers' unreliable A Bibliography of Matthew Arnold, 1932-1970 and writes prior to the 1977 publication of the final volume of Super's edition of the Complete Prose Works. Coulling's review comes a bit late to be of much use, except, perhaps, as a review of reviews. Several articles this year focus upon Arnold's poetics, especially the nature of poetic imagination. One of the more provocative is Jerome Bump's "Science, Religion, and Personification in Poetry" (Cahiers</page><page sequence="7">JEROLDJ. SAVORY / 223 Victoriens &amp; Edouardiens 7: 123-137). Although Bump's article is really a defense of Hopkins' revival of the pastoral tradition of personification in poetry, his comments on Arnold deserve attention. Unlike Hopkins, Arnold too soon lamented the death of religion and failed to anticipate a new world which, "far from being powerless to be born, is now almost too powerful to be borne." Bump refers to the modern scientist's use of metaphors to "provide access to important dimensions of reality" and to Hopkins' recognition of a need for the kind of reverence for life that is at the "forefront of the current scientific struggle to overcome the anthropocentrism threatening our environment." Unlike Ruskin, Arnold found the "pathetic fallacy" an extension of a response to the Zeitgeist which substituted general laws of physical science for "the ultimate personification, God." Thus, "chained by the timidity of his own imagination," Arnold fails in his nature poetry to employ the precise and suggestive metaphors that reflected Hopkins' "sense of a universe animated by powerful cosmic forces." Bump finds Arnold anticipating the predicament of modern man; he finds Hopkins responding to it. Elisabeth G. Gitter, "Undermined Metaphors in Arnold's Poetry" (VP 16: 275-279), finds Arnold deliberately denying the importance of the poet's mission to affirm the spiritual life of the outer world. Nature cannot furnish metaphors for human experience because it has its own independent life quite apart from the poet's active imagination. There can be no pathetic fallacies in a world where people and objects are alike, "subject to the same disinterested rule of the same distant God." Norma Rowen, in "Arnold, Baudelaire, and the Imagination" (CL 30: 353-366), comes at the same problem from a different angle. Taking off from D. G. James's Matthew Arnold and the Decline of English Romanticism (1961), Rowen contrasts Arnold's sense of the fragmentation and unmalleability of nature to Baudelaire's instinct for its "plasticity" and "mysterious unity." Arnold's sense of the weakness of man's creative power and his accompanying sense of the might of nature lead him to aim for nothing higher in art than to be accurately objective. If the poet cannot accomplish this, better that he concentrate on criticism instead. For Baudelaire, however, "whatever the nightmares and disappointments that plague him, he never seems to lose his faith in the imagination and its power to engage what was external to it." For him, the poet remains a gifted seer. Rowen's conclusion concerning Baudelaire is not far from Bump's concerning Hopkins. In "Arnold and Tennyson: The Plight of Victorian Lyricism as Context of Modernism" (Criticism 20: 281-306), Charles Altieri focuses on "imaginative versions of Victorian spiritual conditions which may reveal history by transcending the age's standard descriptive predicates." Discussions of Empedocles on Etna, "Stanzas from the Grande</page><page sequence="8">224/ VICTORIAN POETRY Chartreuse," and "The Scholar-Gipsy," and brief references to "Dover Beach," "The Buried Life," and the Marguerite poems lead Altieri to conclude that "Arnold leaves modernism a heritage in which the public analytic language of self-consciousness and the dream of a profound, unconscious authenticity are irreconcilable and yet necessary features." While Tennyson offers the pathos of voices trapped in restless self expression, Arnold offers the opposite - a lyric voice dominated by the pathos of an inexpressible buried life. Three articles dealing with individual poems deserve mention. Frank R. Giordano, Jr. offers some new insights into Arnold's use of folklore and folk symbolism in "In Defense of Margaret: Another Look at Arnold's The Forsaken Merman'" (VN 54: 23-28). Finding the merman's sea-world an appropriately threatening and chaotic environment for the folklore monster, Giordano reads Margaret's submitting to the monster and her descent to the undersea world as a rejection of her spiritual nature. "The descent, a universal folk motif, usually symbolizes the human wish to overcome death and attain an ideal immortality." Arnold's modifications of Scandinavian folklore, including his use of the silver bell in an Easter setting, signal Margaret's spiritual rebirth and the exorcising of a demonic monster. Thus, Giordano, in opposition to Fulweiler and Culler, finds Margaret "a spiritual sister to a large family of Romantic questers," notably those of Keats and the early Tennyson. Caught up in the perennial conflict between duty and desire, she is tolled back to her natural human self by a silver Easter bell. Any future readings that lean toward sympathy for the unjustly abandoned merman will need to consider Giordano's defense of Margaret and his equally persuasive defense of the symbolic significance of much of Arnold's language. Empedocles on Etna and Sohrab and Rustum, the two poems most frequently discussed in connection with Arnold's declared principles in the 1853 Preface, continue to receive attention. Most noteworthy is Mark Siegchrist's demonstration of Arnold's classical architecture in the symmetrical structure and use of color in Sohrab and Rustum in "Accurate Construction in Arnold's Sohrab and Rustum" (PLL 14: 51-60). Siegchrist concludes that "ironically enough, those readers who like Sohrab and Rustum are less apt to praise its vaunted classical objectivity" than to find the success of the poem in its failure to get Arnold out of himself and to avoid the "allegory of the state of one's own soul." A brief but helpful attempt to articulate Arnold's use of the Empedoclean "Love and Strife" philosophy is D. S. Neff s "Love and Strife in 'Dover Beach'" ( VN53: 28-30). Although Neff draws upon others for his reading of Empedocles, his application of the often-overlooked Fragment</page><page sequence="9">JEROLDJ. SAVORY / 225 20 of On Nature to the setting, situation, and meaning of "Dover Beach" is provocative enough to suggest the need for further studies of Arnold's poems that reflect the Empedoclean philosophy. Regular readers of Victorian Poetry have found Arnold represented well over the past year in this journal. In addition to Gitter's article already noted, Dorothy Deering, "The Antithetical Poetics of Arnold and Clough" (16: 16-31), contrasts Arnold and Clough in terms of their uses of the Zeitgeist as a medium for poetry; Gerhard Joseph, "Victorian Frames: The Windows and Mirrors of Browning, Arnold, and Tennyson" (16: 70-87), shows how a study of Arnold's window imagery suggests his inability to order the world's teeming detail; Patrick J. Creevy, "Richard Holt Hutton on Matthew Arnold" (16: 1 34-146), says that Hutton was able to appreciate Arnold's genius despite Arnold's lack of faith which, for Hutton, leaves Arnold's poetry ultimately dissatisfying; and Park Honan's two contributions, "Fox How and the Continent: Matthew Arnold's Path to the European Sentimental School and 'La Passion Reflechissante"' (16: 58-69) and "Matthew Arnold, Mary Claude, and 'Switzerland'" (16: 369- 375), give us further reason to look forward to the completion of Honan's biography of Arnold. Among numerous brief notes in journals and references to Arnold in sections of books, Robert Liddell Lowe's "An Exchange of Letters Between Frederic Mayer Bird and Matthew Arnold: A Note on the Impress of Literature and Dogma in America" (MP 75: 394-399) is especially interesting because it shows us both letters and offers brief commentary on Bird, an American clergyman and author whose 1878 letter praising Literature and Dogma Arnold found worth answering and saving. Ben Knights's The Idea of the Clerisy in the Nineteenth Century offers a chapter, "The Majority and the Remnant: Matthew Arnold" (pp. 100-139). Knights traces the idea of a clerisy ("intellectuals as a distinct and socially beneficial group") through Coleridge, Carlyle, Arnold, Mill, and others, and stresses the need for "a sustained and necessary dialectic" between what Arnold called "the majority and the remnant." The chapter on Arnold offers no surprising insights into Arnold's social writings, but it does compile appropriate references on his application of the "best self idea to his inherited notion of history and the civilizing role of an intellectual aristocracy.</page><page sequence="10">226/ VICTORIAN POETRY Robert Browning Thomas J. Collins Considering the lack of quality of some of the books published on Browning over the past few years, it is with a degree of relief that I begin this annual task with the report that no books about Browning were published in 1978. But the articles for the year cover a wide range of materials and, in the critical approaches and skills which they employ, reflect the complexity, the variety, and the richness of Browning's work. Rather than organizing this year's review chronologically, as in the past, I have instead selected several interesting papers which exhibit the range of approaches elicited by these qualities in Browning's poetry. One of the most persistent problems in dealing with Browning concerns the matter of text, and this, of course, is the area in which difficulties must be solved before the real work of interpretation and elucidation can proceed. Consequently, it is unfortunate that a number of recent critical works cite the Ohio Browning (now the Ohio-Baylor Browning), thereby implying that this edition should be regarded as "standard" by those unaware of its history. Such citation occurs, I suspect, by default, simply because the Ohio Browning is both modern and convenient, two standards of judgment used by academic consumers as well as by most others in North America. For example, I note that Richard Tobias, in the "General Materials" section of the "Guide to the Year's Work" for 1977 (VP 16: 220), chides an author for quoting a 1919 Browning edition "instead of the first volume of the Ohio Edition." The censure is correct, but the recommendation is inexplicable. Morse Peckham, a former editor of the edition, has warned on more than one occasion that the first two volumes of the edition contain "more than 600 errors" that he knows of, and he suspects the existence of "at least several hundred more" (SBHC 5 [1977]: 11). Jack Herring's comment on the adjacent page of the same issue of SBHC, that the Browning editors recognize some of the weaknesses of the earlier volumes but also believe "in their essential soundness" (p. 10), can only mean that the bindings won't fall off when the volumes are opened. The late John Pettigrew has also demonstrated that the text is hopelessly corrupt (see his 1972 and 1975 papers in Essays in Criticism), and in a posthumously published essay, "For 'Flute' Read 'Lute'; or, Notes on the 'Notes' on Sordello in the Ohio Edition" (77?^ Library 33: 162-169),</page><page sequence="11">THOMAS J.COLLINS / 227 he proves that the annotations are equally untrustworthy. His essay lists hundreds of errors in the "Notes" to Sordello in Volume II, and he offers but a "sampling." Here is a sample of his sampling: Page 364: There are many errors in titles and dates in the annotation. In the brief list of sources: in (1), for '1855' read '1853'; in (3), for 'Ludovico' read 'Lodovico', for'Rerus' read "Rerum', for '28' read '25% for 'Travisina' read "Tarvisina'; in (4), for 'Ludovico' read 'Lodovico'; in (5), for *de Principi di Este' read V/e' Principi d'Este'; in (6), for "Histoire de Republiques' read "Histoire des Republiques'; in (8), for "Eccelinf read "Ecelinf. In the following paragraph, the page (and book?) reference to Mrs. Orr's Life is incorrect; and in the quotation from Sharp, for library' read 'Library'. Page 365: For "The Browning Collection' read 'The Browning Collections'. For '1334' (in the next line) read '930' (strength in elementary mathematics is not a feature of the Ohio edition: '1334' would appear to be a misprint for '1234', a number from which 304 should have been deducted). For the words 'items' and 'item' read 'lots' and 'lot'. For 'thirty-one' read 'thirty- four'. For 'Sothby' read 'Sotheby'. For "Autographs, Letters' (in the Dobell catalogue title) read "Autograph Letters,'. For "AuthgrapH (in the Dodd catalogue title) read 'Autograph'. In the second paragraph, Griffin and Minchin's Life is said to say what it does not say either on page 15 as stated or on any other page- the intended reference is probably to page 25. Those who continue to cite this edition, or who recommend its use, are responsible for the proliferation of textual corruption. And this issue, as Peckham and Pettigrew have shown, is not simply a matter of scholarly disagreement over editorial principles. Until new Browning editions appear and are judged reliable, a distinct possibility with Pettigrew's Penguin Browning, Woolford's Longman's Browning, and Jack's Oxford Poetical Works, all of which are forthcoming, citation of the Ohio-Baylor Browning should be rejected by press and journal editors and readers, as well as by individual scholars. Any successful new edition will immediately displace the Ohio-Baylor Browning, even for purposes of convenient citation. The effective use of close analytical reading, with a psychological twist, is demonstrated in Thomas P. Wolfe's "Browning's Comic Magician: Caliban's Psychology and the Reader's" (SBHC6: 7-24). Wolfe observes that critics of "Caliban" have tended to focus on the poem as an expression of Browning's opinion on certain religious questions at the expense of its dramatic qualities. He argues that religion is not so much the "subject" as it is the "occasion" for the poem, and that its subject, one of Browning's favorites, is "thinking - that pathology of everyday life." Following a detailed rhetorical and psychological analysis of the poem, Wolfe offers a general psychological argument about the implicitly comic nature of the dramatic monologue form. His reading of "Caliban" as a comic masterpiece, his use of Langbaum's sympathy /judgment disequilibrium theory, and his discussion of Freud's analysis of "wit" and the "comic" are interrelated and instructive.</page><page sequence="12">228 / VICTORIAN POETRY Some of the most interesting work on Browning in recent years has been occasioned by that multi-faceted and intriguing poem, Bishop Blougram's Apology. Essays by Julia Markus, "Bishop Blougram and the Literary Men" (VS 21: 171-195), and Susan Hardy Aiken, "Bishop Blougram and Carlyle" (VP 16: 323-340), explore the possible sources of the poem, the former in contemporary documents and its live models, the latter in the work of Thomas Carlyle. Markus' essay is based upon an analysis of the historical setting in 1850-51 and the uproar caused by "The Papal Aggression" - Wiseman's elevation to the position of Cardinal and the reestablishment of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in England. Her intention is to offer more evidence than hitherto available that Wiseman was the model for Blougram and the Reverend Francis Sylvester Mahony, "Father Prout," the model for Gigadibs. That evidence includes material from Wiseman's essay "The Hierarchy," published in the Dublin Review of December, 1850, and two of the journals Wiseman picked out in it for criticism, Punch and the London Globe. In terms of setting, imagery, and word choice, Punch certainly seems to have been one of the sources for the poem and for the portrait of Wiseman as Blougram. Mahony, the brilliant, hard-drinking renegade priest, friend of Browning, another of Wiseman's targets in "The Hierarchy," and editor during 1850-51 of the ant i- Wiseman Globe, no doubt informs Browning's portrait of Gigadibs. This essay contributes to the growing body of material which counters the view of Gigadibs as the shallow and easy target for the Bishop's apologetic exercise. It demonstrates, as well, the rewards to be gained from research in primary documents of the period. Aiken's article reaches conclusions which are less qualified than Markus' with respect to Browning's views of Blougram and Gigadibs - she believes that Blougram is a "quack" and Gigadibs the "authentic hero," whereas Markus concludes that, although there is much to object to in the Wiseman/ Blougram character, Browning preferred this model to the one depicted in the Prout/ Gigadibs figure. But whatever readers decide about this issue, the extensive evidence offered by Aiken on Browning's debt to Carlyle must be taken seriously. She illustrates, in a paper justifiably replete with footnotes, that the monologue contains extensive allusions, ranging from specific ideas and images to exact verbal echoes, not only to Heroes but also to "Characteristics," "Boswell's Life of Johnson," Sartor Resartus, Past and Present, and Latter-Day Pamphlets. She argues that rather than simply parroting Carlyle Browning uses the material in a sophisticated, ironic manner to reveal clearly the speciousness of Blougram's apologetics. Her analysis of the profoundly complex connections between Bishop Blougram and Carlyle's work is detailed and thorough.</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS J.COLLINS / 229 Curtis Dahl undertakes a wider-ranging study of intellectual kinship in "Browning, Architecture, and John Ruskin" (SBHC 6: 32-45). For a poet deeply interested in painting, sculpture, and music, Browning shows surprisingly little interest in architecture per se, as Dahl notes. Nonetheless, explicit or implicit indications of architectural styles of buildings do occur in a large number of his poems. Dahl's essay surveys those poems by Browning which state or imply architectural styles and relates them to the general Victorian view that architecture has moral meaning and also to Ruskin's specific association of certain values with certain styles. He does not insist on firm sets of relationships which would indicate evidence of direct influence. Although many of Browning's poems can be read in a "Ruskinian sense" because the connotations that the various architectural styles have for him follow with surprising closeness the theories of Ruskin, Dahl believes, perhaps too timidly, that Browning was "not an explicit disciple but rather caught up in a general current of thought of the age." Two essays in the 1978 volume of Browning Institute Studies are particularly worthy of attention: Flavia Alaya's "The Ring, the Rescue, &amp; the Risorgimento: Reunifying the Brownings' Italy" (pp. 1-41), and Brendan Kenny's "Browning as a Cultural Critic: Red Cotton Night- Cap Country" (pp. 137-162). Each of these papers offers the possibility of a reexamination and reassessment of certain critical postulates - Alaya's through biographical investigation and Kenny's through an analysis of cultural context. It is in attempting to deal with such complex essays that one is reminded of the injustice and inadequacy of brief yearly surveys. Alaya's essay, a fine example of feminist writing, is as much about Elizabeth as it is about Robert Browning and his poetry. The essay questions the "canonical critical posture" which has evolved concerning the politics and the poetics of both the Brownings: "Where criticism of Robert Browning touches his politics at all, it is usually to affirm his poetic 'detachment' from them, and to allege that, apart from supporting the general principle of Italian unification, he discredited Elizabeth's political views before as well as after her death and was antagonistic to the poetic strategies by which she expressed them." The analysis which proceeds from Alaya's attempt to disentangle these assumptions includes a fresh look at the attitudes of the Brownings to Napoleon III, Robert's subject in Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau, and some interesting speculations on The Ring and the Book. Alaya succeeds in showing how the established "canonical" view has "vitiated critical method as well as biassed critical conclusions." Brendan Kenny offers a novel approach to the problems of interpretation presented by Red Cotton Night- Cap Country. He argues that the key to understanding the poem depends upon our awareness of its cultural context: "The evaluation of the moral life of an individual,</page><page sequence="14">230/ VICTORIAN POETRY particularly one from a different culture, necessarily involves consideration of not only the individual's acts but also the culture, within which the acts have meaning. Such a revaluation of a foreign culture and the determinations it exerts necessarily involves reflection on the poet's own culture." The subsequent examination of Leonce Miranda and his society leads Kenny to conclude that the poem is a grim, ironic, and radical critique of the practice and practitioners of French Catholicism and, in addition, a criticism of the entire socio-religious system of France. Such an approach has interesting ramifications when related, as in this essay, to the presence and the attitude of the narrator of the poem. The final essay upon which I will comment is the most highly technical of all those published in 1978 - Russell Astley's "Browning's Logaoedic Measures" (VP 16: 357-368). Astley is interested in the ingenious prosodic experiments in which Browning indulged on occasion, the author suggests, "not only without self-consciousness but sometimes . . . with no very clear thought of what response he was demanding of his reader." The detailed analysis of Browning's experiments (all of those chosen are classed by Astley as examples of "logaoedicism") culminates in the following summary: It seems plain that when Browning tries to write strictly accentual meters he remains, even when he is poetically effective, somewhat uncertain in this emergent form, as if he still has the older accentual-syllabic tune humming in the back of his mind. He seems more secure and more successful when he writes in what appear to be original accentual-syllabic analogues of classical quantitative lyric-stanza forms. But it is above all his mingling of meters on different levels of abstraction as in "Love Among the Ruins" which stands ... as his most attractive and most interesting departure from tradition. This study is impressive enough, no doubt because it is so precisely technical, that one cannot help but wonder if Harlan Hatcher's 1928 work, The Versification of Robert Browning, is now somewhat outdated. Astley's footnotes suggest that such is the case.</page><page sequence="15">EVELYN BARISH I 231 Arthur Hugh Clough Evelyn Barish Only two articles appeared on Clough in 1978- slim pickings indeed. Both essays, however, are substantial and take opposite positions on the issue Michael Timko has raised about the "Victorianism of Victorian Literature." Dorothy Deering in "The Antithetical Poetics of Arnold and Clough" (VP 16: 16-31) makes a case for dough's cognate relationship with certain contemporary American poets, such as Williams and Stevens, finding in the Englishman's active acceptance of contemporary culture the roots of a more modern poetics than Arnold's. Avoiding merely personal points of comparison, Professor Deering focuses on a useful juxtaposition of their statements about aesthetics; and by giving more attention to Clough in this area than most scholars have done, she illuminates the issue, although the broad outlines are well known. Arnold resisted the Time Stream and sought the overruling governance of a self-imposed Idea, while Clough embraced the Zeitgeist and, Deering thinks, "would have concurred with Stevens that our spirit 'resides / In a permanance composed of impermanence'." She praises Clough for his willingness to express "deep personal feelings," contrasting him to Arnold, who would have poetry "rise to the passionless heights beyond self to a pure realm of aesthetic beauty." Probably Professor Deering's most original contributions are the specific parallels she draws between Clough and modern American poets such as Williams and Stevens. (Appropriately she avoids any new discussion of the Eliot parallelism.) She ties her argument to the distinction made by J. Hillis Miller between the Arnoldian aesthetics dominated by permanent, culture- free values, and a modern poetics committed exclusively to "the immanence of fugitive being." Accurate as this connection may be, perhaps one day we shall be able to trace more directly the affinity of Clough with such Americans as Stevens, Williams, and even Whitman, when we have a study that recognizes them all as being, to some extent, of the tribe of Emerson. For Emerson was a powerful influence upon Clough: when the poetic aspects of this are better understood we shall no doubt see more clearly not only why Clough seems not out of place when mentioned in the same breath as these American poets, but also why he has seemed less fruitful or relevant in his English context. As Arnold himself said of The Bothie, written at white heat after Clough's first long visit with Emerson: "More English than European . . . more American than English." (And Arnold turned in disgust to "refuge" himself with Obermann "in his forest.")</page><page sequence="16">232/ VICTORIAN POETRY Patrick Greig Scott, whose bibliographical work has been noted here previously, prefers in "The Victorianism of Clough" (VP 16: 32-42) to see Clough entirely as a man of the mid-nineteenth century, and not as a modernist. Specifically, Scott points to passages which Clough pruned from Dipsychus for their excessive sexual frankness, and believes that dough's religious tenets were close to those of Tennyson; modern critics, he holds, have overemphasized his subject's skepticism. Professor Scott also suggests that Mrs. Clough's "general position" that the later Clough's ideas were more "'positive and substantial'" has been "vindicated" by "modern scholarship." But this point may seem moot, since all Clough's major works had been written, if not published or finally revised, before he entered that late phase which preceded his early death and to which his widow and Scott allude. In general Professor Scott stresses Clough's "will to believe" and the idealism which exist in strong tension with the irony of his poetry, finding him distinctively Victorian in his deep involvement with the "quests for transcendent meaning." It would have been interesting had Professor Scott been able to take into account the attack launched by John Holloway in The Proud Knowledge (mentioned here last year but probably not available early enough) in which Holloway cites Clough as an example of the lack in the nineteenth century of just that spirit of quest: it would be appropriate for Clough scholars now to join that debate. Thomas Hardy Frank R. Giordano, Jr. Professors R. L. Purdy and Michael Millgate have produced a handsome, meticulously edited, thoroughly annotated, and exceedingly accurate first volume of a projected seven-volume edition of The Collected Letters of Thomas Hardy. Praiseworthy in its editorial policies in presenting texts and notes and in reproducing, when helpful or necessary, Hardy's sketches and drawings, the volume contains a single index of recipients and copious cross-references in the notes. A comprehensive subject index will be prepared for the final volume, along with an appendix containing any letters which surface after the publication of the volumes to which they belong chronologically.</page><page sequence="17">FRANK R. GIORDANO, JR. / 233 The letters in this first volume, covering the years 1862-92, reinforce our sense of the profound reserve of Hardy's nature; and they accentuate more fully what the editors consider the central enigma of his long career: "that a man who took such risks and issued such challenges as a novelist and poet should in his own life have been so discreet, so unsure, so self- defensive." Very few letters from the first forty years of Hardy's life remain, so that we have neither his youthful letters to young friends and sweethearts nor, far more valuable, the letters to Emma during their courtship and engagement. This is a particularly regrettable loss, obviously, as Hardy felt (however seriously we cannot know) that the correspondence was worthy of comparison with that of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett. Emma burned the letters! Rarely does Hardy use letters as vehicles for creative self-expression. He is private to the point of being impersonal, and the great majority of his letters are business missives to editors and publishers, in which Hardy evolves into an astute agent for his own works, sharp-eyed over royalties and printers' lapses. Hardy's sensitivity to criticism, particularly of the alleged "moral" problems of his work, issues in chronic laments; but he makes little direct comment on his own art. We are advised, however, that the letters in volumes to come are longer, more expansive, and less cautiously guarded; so much almost goes without saying, after the spiceless offerings in volume one. The editors, of course, cannot be blamed for this fare; nor can their efforts so far be too highly commended. Lance St. John Butler has written a short critical study, Thomas Hardy, addressed to general readers interested in an introduction to the works themselves (little or no "backgrounds" are provided) or to students making a start on the author. It includes a short breezy chapter on "The Poems," which unfortunately has factual errors in both its opening sentences. Butler accepts the outmoded idea that Hardy "did not develop from his early views ... or about the sort of poetry he wanted to write"; and he is convinced that the "poetry is extraordinarily homogeneous and highly characteristic." In none of his discussions of the love poetry, Nature, or Hardy's negative metaphysics does Butler rise above the outdated and vague generalizations I have quoted. There are far better general introductions than this one. John Bayley's An Essay on Hardy is a frustrating book for lovers of the poems. There are innumerable perceptive insights in this rambling, discursive book, which often reads much like very brilliant late night cocktail party conversation. Bayley makes reiterated, though only half- hearted, efforts to unify the discussion around basic ideas (most importantly for readers of the poetry: "Hardy seems naturally and continuously present in his poetry, even when it is in the form of a tale or spoken in an invented voice") and artistic concerns (Bayley continually</page><page sequence="18">234 / VICTORIAN POETRY reverts to the issue of the "form" of Hardy's novels; but his sense of the meaning of the word is unhelpfully vague and, at any rate, too tardily developed to be of much service); and his wide-ranging erudition and occasionally graceful style make one feel what a book he could have written if he had only rolled up his sleeves. That poetic presence of Hardy's is an ample subject for a lengthy, intelligent study; it gets far less than it requires, and deserves, from Bayley. Like Butler, he gives more attention to the fiction, with better results than with the poems. Two noteworthy editions of Hardy's poetry appeared during the year. John and Eirian Wain have gathered The New Wessex Selection of Thomas Hardy's Poetry, a paperback that prints the Gibson text and is uniform with Macmillan London Ltd.'s series of Hardy's novels and stories. The Wains wisely offer nearly 200 poems, including the whole "1912-13" sequence, which makes entirely good sense; that poem loses as much as A Shropshire Lad and In Memoriam when it is cut up in anthologies. Moreover, the selection reflects the general sense that the heart of Hardy's lyric achievement is in the Satires of Circumstance and Moments of Vision volumes; the Wains take fully half of their choices from these two splendid works. By far the best introduction Wain has done for Hardy's works (his earlier pieces for the short selections of poems and stories were quite perfunctory), his essay is distinguished for its affectionate respect for Hardy's "immense technical skill and . . . beautifully sensitive ear." Wain feels that Hardy's unique place in English poetry has its basis in the tradition of the medieval lyric: "The real roots of Hardy's poetry are the tough, clinging, gnarled but still green and flowing roots of English popular lyric verse." Wain's enthusiasm for the "Poems of 1912-13" is measured by his ranking them as the Everest among Hardy's poems about love, fit to stand beside Shakespeare's Sonnets. This edition, should it become available for use in classrooms in America, becomes the obvious choice for teachers wishing to give their students a substantial feast of Hardy's poems. Less likely to flood the classrooms, but an especially impressive volume on its own terms, is Harold Orel's New Wessex Edition of The Dynasts. For decades an enthusiastic champion of the high merits of that epic-drama, and an experienced and dedicated editor of Hardy, Orel was the obvious choice for the task of bringing out The Dynasts. It may be the handsomest volume in the whole series, with its large pages, clear print, and regal purple cover; what a pleasant change from the original paper edition, whose type was nearly illegible and whose spine was forever cracking up! Orel's notes are abundantly helpful in providing the variety of kinds of information required to comprehend the vast historical backgrounds to The Dynasts. And his introductory essay, a version of which readers of VP were privileged to find in the recent special Hardy issue, is as fine as everything else about this volume.</page><page sequence="19">FRANK R. GIORDANO, JR. / 235 A final note. In a subsequent issue of VP, the second volume of Robert Gittings' biography, Thomas Hardy's Later Years, will receive a fuller review than the format of this report allows. Gerard Manley Hopkins Howard W. Fulweiler Three books on Hopkins need to be considered this year: James Milroy's linguistic-philological study, The Language of Gerard Manley Hopkins (1977); John Robinson's biographical critical study, In Extremity: A Study of Gerard Manley Hopkins; and Paddy Kitchen's popular biography, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Although it is uneven, Milroy's study should be read by anyone interested in Hopkins' language. The work is organized in two parts, the first presenting Hopkins' "notion of current language in the light of his linguistic interests," and the second focusing on "the methods used by the poet to heighten this language in his poetry." The first part is the best. Milroy's description of Hopkins' interest in Victorian philological research- local dialect, Germanic purism, and the like- is not altogether original but it is very well done. Milroy makes the arguable but interesting suggestion that it was not Hopkins "who breathed life into philology," but "it was philology that helped to breathe life into Hopkins' poetry." One might quibble at Milroy's tendency to raise Hopkins up over other Victorian poets on a special linguistic pedestal. Although Hopkins read Max Muller, Kemble, and Trench, these writers were longtime friends of Tennyson. The second half of the study contains interesting and intelligent discussions of such matters as Hopkins' struggle for precision in his word coinings and his use of compounds, but these are rarely integrated into the interpretation of particular poems. A seventeen-page appendix gives "A Commentary on Words used in Rare, Special, or Non-Standard Senses in Hopkins's Poetry." John Robinson's In Extremity describes Hopkins' art as a poetry of "conclusions or of active engagement to reach them, not of a mood of receptiveness that supposes the will to be in abeyance or the mind to be widely ranging." Admitting that Hopkins may be suspect in an age that</page><page sequence="20">236 / VICTORIAN POETRY distrusts and avoids self-denial, Robinson argues that "Hopkins' verse is at one with his religious commitment." This is not, he insists, "the same as saying that it was his religious training which produced his poetry." Although Robinson offers no extraordinary scholarly discoveries or revolutionary critical insights, his intelligent and perceptive treatment is in small ways illuminating throughout. His discussion of Hopkins' poetic theory, for instance, includes the astute observation that Hopkins' interest in poetry both as form and as "heard speech" makes a conflict that he did not sufficiently recognize. The main trend of Hopkins' work, however, is "the selective employment of the resources of the English language so as to develop in his verse the rigour which characterised his spiritual life." Despite its biographical emphasis, a possible weakness in Robinson's work is his comparative neglect of the external forces that shaped Hopkins' life and art. Paddy Kitchen's biography is often exasperating and usually readable. Although the book offers little that is new and does not evidence more than ordinary intellectual or aesthetic depth, it attempts to be fair and its author is obviously sympathetic to Hopkins. Mrs. Kitchen tries to supply the larger Victorian background that one misses in Robinson's book. The exasperation comes from her cavalier attitude towards the ordinary decencies of literary scholarship. "Since this is a personal rather than an academic study," she writes, "I have not given detailed references to sources." We are told, for instance, about Hopkins' summarizing, partly in Latin, the number of nocturnal emissions he could recall having, but are given no references for this information. In fact the entire book has no footnotes at all - only a brief bibliography. There is a breezy treatment of the Oxford Movement to place Hopkins in the larger Victorian context, and, among other things, a chapter, "The Eton Connection," on Digby Mackworth Dolben to place him in a private context. Although Mrs. Kitchen remains formally agnostic on whether Hopkins was homosexual, she nonetheless is capable of making the following gratuitous remark about Hopkins' delight in R. W. Dixon's line, "Her eyes like lilies shaken by the bees": "It could recall the thick-lashed, fluttering, luminous eyes of someone who but dimly perceived the everyday shapes and shadows of the real world. It could have reminded Hopkins of Dolben. But that is just an intuitive guess." Despite its great unevenness, this biography has merit, especially for those who are just beginning the study of Hopkins and his background. Luisa Conti Camaiora adds to this year's biographical research in a competent but unoriginal account of Hopkins' unhappiness in Ireland in "Hopkins in Ireland" (RLMC 31: 204-224). In "Hopkins and Dowden: A Connection Not Made" (HQ 5: 82-84) David J. DeLaura laments the fact that Hopkins and Edward Dowden, Professor of English at Trinity</page><page sequence="21">HOWARD W. FULWEILER / 237 College, came close to becoming friends in Dublin but did not. Hopkins' successful literary friendship with Canon Dixon is the subject of Florence S. Boos's "Christian Pre-Raphaelitism: G. M. Hopkins' Debt to Richard Watson Dixon" (VP 16: 314-322). Dixon, Professor Boos suggests, was a kind of orthodox intermediary between Hopkins and Pre-Raphaelite poets like Rossetti and Morris. Sister Marcella M. Hollo way, C. S. J., intelligently recounts again the story of Hopkins' impassioned defense of Wordsworth's "Intimations Ode" to Dixon in "Hopkins' Defense of Wordsworth's Great Ode" (HQ 5: 69-74). General critical understanding and interpretation of Hopkins has received a thoughtful contribution from Jerome Bump in "Science, Religion, and Personification in Poetry" (Cahiers Victoriens &amp; Edouardiens 7: 123-137). Bump points interestingly to the decline of pastoral poetry, with its traditional personification of nature. This decline paralleled the general loss of faith in God and His immanence in nature, as experienced, for example, by writers like Arnold and Ruskin. Arnold's "feeble" religious intuition was "virtually dead, while that nascent allegiance to rationalism" which led him to "the more abstract, philosophic diction of scientific laws was for him 'powerless to be born'." Bump then sets up an explanatory scheme in which Wallace Stevens represents the new rationalist attempt to describe the mindless nature of modern science and "to get outside ourselves" in the struggle against the "voracious anthropocentrism" which is destroying our environment. Hopkins, of course, represents the older, pre-Arnoldian view of a divinely animated nature, which he celebrates in "fiercely reactionary" poems that insist on "richness of image and sound as perceptible emblems of order and splendor in the world." Ironically, Hopkins' old-fashioned anthropomorphic attitude towards the universe produced poems such as "Binsey Poplars" and "Ribblesdale," placing him in sympathy with the late twentieth- century scientific struggle against "voracious anthropocentrism" far more than Arnold or Stevens. J. Hillis Miller's "Nature and the Linguistic Moment," in Nature and the Victorian Imagination, ed. U. C. Knoepflmacher and G. B. Tennyson, reworks an earlier essay, "The Linguistic Moment in 'The Wreck of the Deutschland'," The New Criticism and After, ed. Thomas Daniel Young (1976), to argue that "Hopkins's linguistic underthought subverts his Catholic overthought." Margery Sabin speculates in "The Lovely Behavior of Things: Hopkins and Baudelaire," English Romanticism and the French Tradition (1976), that whereas Baudelaire and many modern poets see the value of poetry as "a verbal gesture against the tedium or sterility of experience," Hopkins and other post-Romantic English poets are examples of the nineteenth-century English "faith in the potential if not actual value of experience rooted in perception: 'these things were here and</page><page sequence="22">238 / VICTORIAN POETRY but the beholder / Wanting'." In his ingenious "'Hornlight Wound to the West': The Inscape of the Passion in Hopkins' Poetry" (VP 16: 297-313), James Finn Cotter provides a fund of interesting information and conjecture as he discusses types of Christ's Passion and Resurrection throughout the poems. Although some of the interpretations seem strained, one always learns a great deal from Cotter's gnostic hermeneutics. Thomas A. Zaniello's "The Tonic of Platonism: The Origins and Use of Hopkins' 'Scape'" (HQ 5: 5-16) argues that Hopkins' use of the word "scape" and his Oxford study of Platonic epistemology were complementary, "scape," like "inscape," being part of a developing "theory of perception." Gerald Monsman offers the thesis in "Hopkins and the 'here / Buckle!' of Creation" (HQ 5: 23-31) that Hopkins' experience of nature is "the experience of Christ's own death and resurrection and typical of all the 1877 sonnets is an imagery expressive of this paradoxical condition of falling and rising simultaneously." Finally, Richard F. Giles has edited "A Hopkins Bibliography: 1974- 1977" (HQ 5: 87-122). This useful bibliography is not critical, but it is nearly current and quite comprehensive, offering an unusually large international list of publications. The Pre-Raphaelites Allan R. Life I Though this has been a productive year for scholarship on Dante Gabriel Rossetti, these publications largely concern his visual art. Even the most consistently literary of the major articles, George P. Landow's "'Lips touching lips with immortality': Rossetti's Typological Structures" (SIR 17: 247-265) includes a detailed interpretation of The Seed of David, Rossetti's altarpiece in Llandaff Cathedral. Some consideration of this work was in fact inevitable, for the very title of this triptych suggests the anticipations of Christ in the Old Testament identified through typological interpretation. As Landow demonstrates, this kind of orthodox typology also dominates Rossetti's picture and poem on The Passover in the Holy Family and his sonnet for The Holy Family by Michelangelo. But it is not</page><page sequence="23">ALLAN R. LIFE / 239 with such explicitly typological works that Landow is primarily concerned; while he concedes that the "moments of vision" in Rossetti's pictures are "not the result of a concern with typology and prophecy," he proposes that comparable aspects of Rossetti's poetry derive from precisely these sources. In support of this theory, Landow ranges widely through the canon, in which he finds both the "secularized typology" of "The Burden of Nineveh" and a pervasive effort to replace "Christ as a center of human history." Yet these interpretations, though often persuasive in themselves, do not support a rapid transition to Rossetti's concern with dead deathless hours, with which Landow associates one of "the two basic structures" "abstracted" by the poet from typological symbolism. That typology, "orthodox" as well as "secular," contributed to Rossetti's interest in transcendent moments is undeniable; that it was even the dominant source of a preoccupation so central to the Neo-Platonic tradition is at best unlikely. Particularly misleading is Landow's contention that what he considers the free adaptation of typology by Rossetti evolved from "explicit and skillful use" of this concept in "his early poetry." In fact, the two poems with which Landow exemplifies this conventional stage of Rossetti's progress were composed in 1869 ("The Passover") and 1880 ("The Holy Family"). Despite his avowed concern with the development of Rossetti's symbolism, Landow ignores not only these dates but those of the other poems he cites, and to this scholarly limitation are added several mistranscriptions. Landow's analysis of the sonnet for the Passover watercolor is one of many recent discussions of the aspect of Rossetti's work considered by Wolfgang Lottes in "Take out the Picture and Frame the Sonnet': Rossetti's Sonnets and Verses for his Own Works of Art" (Anglia 96: 108- 135). Essentially an anthology of standard documentation and critical topics, this article at least has the virtue of articulating two central issues in the study of Rossetti's art: the extent to which his pictures are dependent on verbal explanation, and the ways in which their symbolism altered during his career. Lottes argues that most of the verses for Rossetti's pictures are truly explanatory, and that the need for such supplements to his work increases as his symbolism becomes more personal and his content less narrative. With works like A Sea-Spell { 1875-77) this need becomes drastic; indeed, Lottes finds "all his paintings of that genre" characterized by "their degree of interchangeability," by a symbolic level of meaning that would be unintelligible without extensive interaction between visual motifs and verbal imagery. The problem confronting Lottes is the apparent disparity between Rossetti's early and late pictures: between the overtly illustrative work and the portrait drawings that dominate his early career, and the oils of brooding women with which his later oeuvre is associated. And, though</page><page sequence="24">240 / VICTORIAN POETRY this issue is essential to students of the poetry as well as the painting, it has been obscured by the preoccupations and assumptions of many Rossetti specialists. Too often, the obsession with Rossetti's models has distorted the iconographical level of his art; there are still writers who preface the titles of Pandora, Proserpine, even La Pia de' Tolomei with Jane Morris as .... Equally misleading is the tendency to dismiss all Rossetti's paintings after the late sixties as symptoms of collapse - of inspiration, technique, or moral commitment. The hanging of the Rossetti retrospective at the Royal Academy in 1973 reflected both attitudes: space was lavished on biographically oriented exhibits (including a "Stunners Gallery") while the principal works of the seventies and eighties, including the large Dante's Dream, were crammed into a single room. This arrangement did not accentuate the links between the early and late works, which range from Rossetti's lifelong concern with embodying abstractions and states of mind to his use of the narrative and to some degree the formal techniques of his early period in La Pia (1868-80) and Dante's Dream (1869-71) and in such late studies as Michael Scott's Wooing (c. 1870-71), Orpheus and Eurydice (1875), and The Death of Lady Macbeth (c. 1875). At the same time, the very mention of these three studies does suggest a change, if not in Rossetti's imagination then at least in his exercise of it. For while these designs languished in his portfolio Rossetti painted potboiling replicas and several other works with little to recommend them even from a conceptual standpoint. In his "broadly Marxist" survey of Rossetti's career (1975), John Nicoll argues that his art was "perverted by the inexorable and uncontrolled working of the market forces and his surrender to them" (p. 153), and though this diagnosis is excessively materialistic, some of Rossetti's later paintings were influenced directly by the men who commissioned them. Of course, Rossetti was never oblivious to the market; he would doubtless have painted more religious pictures in the fifties had Ecce Ancilla Domini 7 sold more readily, and he altered a few works according to Ruskin's specifications. However, Ruskin and the patrons he recruited generally encouraged different facets of Rossetti's talent than such later clients as William Graham, M.P. for Glasgow, and Frederick Leyland, the Liverpool shipowner. In what C. L. Cline believes to be "Dante Gabriel Rossetti's 'Last' Letter" (LCUT 9: 74- 77), Jhe artist informed Ernest Chesneau that the insufficient market for such "important compositions" as The Seed of David "has led to my producing a number of life-sized figures or half-figures of a poetical character, for which I found the demand much greater." Many of these figures of "poetical character" adorned the walls of Frederick Leyland, whose correspondence with Rossetti has been edited by Francis L. Fennell, Jr. In his introduction, Fennell raises important questions about Leyland's influence on Rossetti, though in proposing</page><page sequence="25">ALLAN R. LIFE / 241 answers he relies too heavily on letters that are among the painter's least spontaneous. A single letter from Rossetti to Leyland- that of September 30, 1873 - emerged from four months of private consultations and strategems, which are charted along with similar imbroglios in C. L. Cline's The Owl and the Rossettis: Letters of Charles A. Howelland Dante Gabriel Christina, and William Michael Rossetti. Despite its comprehensive title this is a selective edition of the correspondence by these figures in the University of Texas, and over sixty of D. G. Rossetti's letters to Howell are only summarized by Cline. Almost all of Howell's letters to Rossetti are given in full, however, and extensive documentation is provided of their negotiations between late September, 1872 and mid- July, 1874, when Rossetti lived at Kelmscott and employed Howell as his art agent. Howell arranged many sales for Rossetti during this period, and his letters resound with mellifluous enterprise; less engaging are his sneers at Leyland and the other patrons he cultivated and the impression he sometimes creates of playing both ends against the middle. For his part, Rossetti was suspicious of his agent; their professional relationship had lasted little more than a year when he all but accused Howell of plotting with Murray Marks to expropriate a profit on Dante's Dream (see Rossetti's Letters, ed. Doughty and Wahl [1965-67], III, 1238). Admittedly, Rossetti distrusted less flamboyant allies than Howell at this time, and it is notable that Cline, in his introductory biography of Howell, conveys better than Fennell the personal circumstances under which the painter became more reliant on patrons like Leyland and Graham. After delivering the blanket judgment that "the paintings of Rossetti's last years show a marked decline in artistic power," Fennell observes: This decline has been attributed by some to emotional and physical illness, and by others to the need for making potboilers to keep up his income. These explanations are not satisfactory. Illness need not diminish a talent, as artists like Keats have often shown us .... Moreover he had always had to paint for a living; that kind of economic pressure was nothing new. And he himself recognized no decline in his art at all. In the letters to Leyland, Fennell perceives "another explanation for this decline, and that is the degree to which Rossetti had come to rely on a very small circle of patrons" (p. xxiii). But this state of affairs was itself the result of professional and personal forces, including financial pressures and illness. The stages of Rossetti's deterioration in the sixties have been noted in every biography since William Rossetti's Memoir: the rise in his expenditures after his wife's death in 1862; the onset of insomnia in 1867 along with eye trouble that in the autumn of 1868 prevented him from painting; most disastrous of all, the beginning in 1870 of his addiction to chloral, a drug producing, as his brother notes, "'deep melancholy and weakness of will'" (Memoir [1895], I, 287). And, intertwined with these</page><page sequence="26">242 / VICTORIAN POETRY events, the growing obsession with Jane Morris which by 1868 was clearly observable to intimates like William Bell Scott. The traumatic culmination of these and related circumstances has been chronicled in William E. Fredeman's Prelude to the Last Decade: Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the Summer of 1872 ( 1 97 1 ). If these facts do not explain the course of Rossetti's later career as a painter, they raise inescapable questions about it. Is it a coincidence that it was arguably after 1866- the date, incidentally, when his extant correspondence with Leyland began- that Rossetti's work became truly dominated with the subjects and treatment that characterize his later period, or that it was in the years following that he accepted the long-term commissions from Leyland and Graham that, in Fennell's words, made him "a prisoner ... of his own business arrangements" (p. xxiv)? And is it also a coincidence that Leyland, by FennelFs own reckoning, gained greater influence over Rossetti's art in 1873, when the painter was isolated at Kelmscott, obsessed with money problems and still plagued by the delusions of persecution that had overwhelmed him a year before? Considering the mental collapse and its aftermath described in Fredeman's monograph, the wonder is not that Rossetti's later art lacks triumphs analogous to Keats's in 1819, but that his final decade did not resemble more closely the "posthumous existence" that preceded Keats's death. As for Fennell's argument concerning Rossetti's patrons, the problem was less their number than their tastes, which were too narrow and too much alike. Fennell rightly associates this situation with Rossetti's refusal to exhibit, though his enumeration of the benefits the painter thereby relinquished- "new buyers, new demands, new criticism," potentially "lucrative sales"- conveys an overly sanguine view of the available art market. The career of the ultimate public artist, John Everett Millais, is a poor recommendation for the kind of buying conducted at the Royal Academy, and in 1873 Howell reported that even Millais was concentrating on portraits because the demand for "important pictures" had declined (Cline, no. 288). Admittedly, Rossetti was probably mistaken in not contributing to the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877, and had he fulfilled his intention to mount a retrospective exhibition of his best work he might have benefited his career in the ways that Fennell describes. But, once again, Rossetti's inner and professional selves are inseparable. If he was morbidly sensitive about publishing his poetry, he could hardly welcome public exposure of late pictures which (like Fennell on page xxvi) he considered inferior in many respects to so early a work as Ecce Ancilla Domini! (see Letters, III, 1283). Always unwilling to "'send any picture wandering after a purchaser as my property'" (Cline, no. 352), Rossetti became increasingly hostile to wandering purchasers. "Damn in all, what do you want?" stormed Howell in October, 1874. "Had I been able to bring</page><page sequence="27">ALLAN R. LIFE / 243 one or two men long since you would have had two or three far better buyers than either Leyland or Graham" (Cline, no. 385). Though "better" to Howell primarily meant "more lucrative," he presumably had additional, aesthetic considerations in mind. As they emerge in Howell's admittedly biased letters, neither Leyland nor Graham was an ideal patron for Rossetti: both wanted "'fine [i.e., oil] pictures'" (no. 242) and Graham by 1873 was calling for "'bright'" ones as well (no. 257). As for Leyland, his aesthetic prescriptions support Fennell's judgment that his criteria were formal, if not decorative: "The pictures must run round like music notes, a head in each, that one may follow them round the room'" (no. 261). Yet Fennell exaggerates the degree to which Rossetti absorbed such values; in an analogy that should have gone as easily as it doubtless came, he compares the artist to Pictor Ignotus ("monotonous I paint / These endless cloisters and eternal aisles"). As Fennell concedes later in his introduction, even Rossetti's uninspired letters to Leyland dwell on the figurative meaning of such paintings as Proserpine, and the artist's verse and prose commentaries on pictures bought by Leyland are not the work of a symphonic paperhanger. Rossetti's milieu during this period is further illuminated in Odette Bornand's edition of The Diary of W. M. Rossetti: 1870-1873. As she explains in her foreword, the editor actually began this project before 1939, when she intended to publish the series of letters and diary entries which William Michael Rossetti prepared for publication in 1903 as "Rossetti Papers, 2nd Series, 1870-1876." After the war, she decided to edit three years of the diary, which in its first year survives only in "the typed version which W.M.R. prepared for the Press" (p. viii). Her account of this typescript, however, cannot be strictly correct, for though occasional ellipses indicate omissions from the original, these do not include five descriptions of Swinburne's intemperance that would have been unprintable in 1903. And such references are uncommon even in the manuscript entries; more than most diarists, W. M. Rossetti kept his journals for posterity, epitomizing the events of his circle with a discreet objectivity that was sometimes hard to sustain. When he could not sustain it, the diary ceased; there are virtually no entries during his brother's illness in 1872, and when he resumes his chronicle in November he conceals the depression that he continued to suffer himself for several months. Even the event that lightened this burden is suppressed; on August 6, 1873 he simply notes: "Many things have passed . . . which I am not minded at present to record" - these "things" include his engagement to Lucy Brown! From this impersonal but sympathetic viewpoint, William Rossetti describes subjects as varied as Christina Rossetti's illness, Trelawny's memories of Shelley and Byron, the literary fortunes of Whitman and "B. V.," and the attacks by Robert Buchanan that precipitated his brother's collapse.</page><page sequence="28">244/ VICTORIAN POETRY II As in 1977, the most substantial work on William Morris concerns his political activities. First issued in 1972, Paul Meier's La Pense'e Utopique de William Morris has been published in two volumes as William Morris the Marxist Dreamer. This new title acknowledges the orientation of Meier's study, in which the numerous literary references - unfortunately unindexed in the English edition - are marshalled to demonstrate Morris' conversion to orthodox Marxism. Though profusely documented, Meier's doctrinaire arguments have already been challenged in such articles as Adam Buick's "William Morris and Incomplete Communism" (Journal of the William Morris Society 3 [1976]: 16-32)and in the "Postscript" to E. P. Thompson's William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary (2nd ed., 1977). If Morris is a Marxist dreamer to Meier, he is part of a venerable cultural tradition to Charlotte H. Oberg, whose book on the canon is appropriately titled A Pagan Prophet. Throughout Morris' work, Oberg finds a "highly civilized" version of true paganism, based on an intuitive sense of the destiny which a hero must embrace to renew his society and inaugurate a new cycle of ages. Her discussion of this aspect of the long narrative poems recalls several recent studies, especially Blue Calhoun's The Pastoral Vision of William Morris: " The Earthly Paradise" (1975) and Carole Silver's "The Earthly Paradise: Lost" ( VP, 1975). Yet Oberg practically ignores Morris scholarship after the early seventies, and though she footnotes a brief speculation on the "pastoral" dimension of The Earthly Paradise with the assurance that Blue Calhoun's book appeared "since this paragraph was first written"( p. 74, n. 2), she less candidly presents the long narrative poems as having "received only desultory attention from modern critics" (pp. 19-20). In fact, her three chapters on The Earthly Paradise convey less vividly than Carole Silver's essay the dynamic patterns of the work. The reason, ironically, is Oberg's preoccupation with articulating the principles of unity not only of The Earthly Paradise but of the entire canon, which she comprehends in a series of maxims that she is hard pressed to support in succeeding chapters. Indeed, the basic weakness of this book is that its treatment of individual works is too disproportionate to justify its claims to comprehensiveness. Compared to the rather discursive sections on 77?*' Earthly Paradise, the chapters on Jason and Sigurd are location guides to themes already emphasized in the longer poem. A Dream of John Ball, News from Nowhere, and the lectures are given still shorter shrift, and Love is Enough, recently discussed by Frederick Kirchhoff as "A Crisis in William Morris' Poetic Development" ( VP% 1977), is omitted altogether.</page><page sequence="29">ALLAN R. LIFE / 245 Oberg's pronouncements on "the uniformity of vision ... in all Morris's writings" (p. 76) weigh heavily on her penultimate chapter, where she tries to relate the imprisonment theme in The Defence of Guenevere to her chief unifying concept, the rebirth of the hero and through him of his society. Not only does the "reiterated prison image clearly [suggest] the womb symbolism that writers on anthropology and comparative religion have found in initiation rites," but the poems as a whole "seem to arise from ... a rudimentary millennial ontology that was to bear continuing fruit as it developed throughout Morris's life" (p. 142). Oberg then applies these theories to "The Blue Closet," which occurs in a tower that is "both a phallus and a womb wherein the four women in one . . . await their rebirth" via Arthur, who is "simultaneously a corpse, a spirit from the underworld, a demon lover, and a fertility figure" reminiscent of Tennyson's two Arthurs, in whose "thrice as fair" manifestations Oberg detects "a noticeable phallicism" (pp. 146, 149). The absence of such "Freudian" insights from the rest of the book shows how the author's effort to evoke the "living unity" of Morris' work has imposed disunity on her own critical methods. Oberg is more successful with the kind of archetypal patterns that abound in the late prose romances, and her two chapters on these works are incontestably her best. Parallels between the romances and traditional folklore, documented with citations from such scholars as Mircea Eliade, are expounded with a precision and a relevance that are less conspicuous in Oberg's allusions in other chapters to nineteenth-century figures. The Poets of the Nineties Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV One article and three books stand above other scholarship concerning the decade. Richard Benvenuto's "The Function of Language in the Poetry of Ernest Dowson" (ELT 21 : 158-167), one of the best critiques of this poet to appear these ten years, makes us aware of Dowson's place as the representative poet of the fin de siecle, one whose sensitivity to the transitional nature of the nineties was paramount. The stature of</page><page sequence="30">246/ VICTORIAN POETRY Tennyson was an impossible goal for many poets of the era, and they began to question the nature of and assumptions inherent in poetry. Dowson explored the matter of language (and its powerlessness as contrasted to the "efficacy of silence") by means of his own poems. The exploration of language is part of a greater dichotomy symbolized in his verse, the split between the sheltered haven of quiet and the pressure-filled, noisy world. In the former, a transcendence of words has been achieved. The world of Dowson's poetry, like that of Hardy's, indicates a keen awareness of time and flux. Altogether, the ideas presented here ought to make us reconsider Dowson's value as a poet, particularly as one with something to say, which credential has often been denied him. Another poet whose aesthetics are finally receiving their due is Housman. B. J. Leggett's The Poetic Art of A. E. Housman: Theory and Practice provides an admirable companion to his Housman's Land of Lost Content: A Critical Study of A Shropshire Lad (1970). Leggett assesses the circumstances leading to the delivery of the Leslie Stephen Lecture, published as The Name and Nature of Poetry (1933), and the aftermath of its impact upon poetical and critical circles. Leggett's work disperses myths, most notably those surrounding the Housman-T. S. Eliot crosscurrents, those shuffling him from "Victorian" through "Modern" in attempting to place him, and those centering upon "inconsistencies" between his poetic theory and productions. For decades it has been fashionable to counterpoise Housman's "naiVete" to Eliot's density in attempting to raise the latter's artistic stature at the expense of the former's poetic abilities. Leggett makes clearer than ever before the affinities of Eliot's Norton Lectures, published as 77?^ Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1933), with Housman's pronouncements. Both emphasize the need to integrate present with past in artistic and cultural pursuits, as well as emphasizing the spiritual dislocations inherent in separations of one from the other. Moreover, Eliot's vision of a wasteland is anticipated in A Shropshire Lad, the themes of which recur in Last Poems and the posthumous volumes - no mighty wonder when we remember that many of these "later" pieces were composed at about the same time as many of those in the first book. Housman has been termed variously (and uneasily?) a "Victorian," "Transition," or "Modern" poet. Leggett deftly charts his subject's outgrowth from Victorian writers' stances as sages or seers, as well as from their aims at creating things of formal beauty. Housman's artistic vision perceives that God may not be in His heaven and that all's not necessarily right with the world. Thus, the content in his typical poems is, as a matter of course, grim. His characteristic verse forms attempt to order this chaotic content, and the combination is aesthetically consistent with his theory. If "poetry" centers in emotional realms, as Housman exhorted his listeners</page><page sequence="31">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV j 247 and readers to believe, his own variety serves to point up, because it is inescapable, and to prepare readers for the pain and sorrow in this our life. The ballad form, the often colloquial diction, and the intermittent supernaturalism combine with the "message" of modern times to merge present with past, providing in consequence an integration of theory and practice in Housman that has commonly been bypassed by those with eyes that see nothing, except the apparent "pessimism," and ears that hear nothing, except what they sense as jingling, sing-song music. The texts explicated to demonstrate Leggett's assumptions come chiefly from Last Poems, More Poems, and Additional Poems, by way of complementing and supplementing Leggett's earlier work on A Shropshire Lad. Although he discerns numerous poetic excellences in the later verse, he simultaneously reinforces the image of Housman at his poetic heights in his first book of poems, as witnessed in the analysis of "Terence, This is Stupid Stuff." Brother Laurence comes before us here as no great shakes in understanding AEH's literary merits. Overall this book is too important to pass by for anyone who has serious interests in English poetry since the time of Tennyson. We are reminded of the Victorians' interest - a consuming interest for the Pre- Raphaelites, the nineties poets, and Housman - in Blake, surely a poet whose work highlights emotionalism as the stuff of "poetry." Leggett also provides a compact history of poetic theory, not ignoring practice either, from the Victorians (and earlier) to the mid-twentieth century. He notes reactions against Victorianism in form and content by later poets and critics. Housman's significance in these currents and eddies emerges as far more central than many other writers of histories of English verse these last fifty years have willingly admitted. Leggett's book calls for much additional revaluation of this subtle poet, whose cause is here served admirably for a second time. A third "poet" of the nineties, Aubrey Beardsley, maintains his reputation and fascination, as attested in Kenneth Clark's The Best of Beardsley. Oddly, Clark's "Introduction" - of thirty-seven pages - opens with remarks implying that the Beardsley boom and the best writing about him, the creme de la creme being Brian Reade's 1967 book, have come and gone. Bibliographies and the pages of this column during the past five years furnish a counterstatement! Clark's choice is, as he emphasizes, a personal selection; thus he aims for choices representing excellence, personality of the artist, his architectural artistry, and eroticism at the expense of obscenity. A caveat about this "personal" feeling of Clark's: Are the drawings for The Works of Edgar Allan Poe so lacking in subtlety and irony as he thinks? Another caveat: Where, oh where is the cover illustration for Vol. I of The Yellow Book, in which the fat lady and the masker provoked such outcries among the bourgeoisie?</page><page sequence="32">248 / VICTORIAN POETRY In other respects Clark's book is first rate, just the sort of volume to introduce the uninitiate and to draw the seasoned once more to Beardsley's compelling art. Noting the young illustrator's delight in drama (and in opera, wherein Beardsley took particular interest in Wagner), Clark includes many drawings that revolve around dramatic themes. The orientalism so much a part of the later nineteenth-century scene in literature and other arts is given better analysis here than in any other critique of Beardsley that I have seen. The illustrations for Wilde's Salome, those for Le Morte Darthur, those for The Rape of the Lock, as well as others giving pictorial supplementation to literary and other art works, including the Venus-Tannhauser, the Pierrot theme, the woman question, The Yellow Book, and The Savoy, reinforce the image of a Beardsley whose sensibilities were alert to the contemporaneous scene, who enjoyed most of it, and who played hob with Victorian staidness. That he in turn also influenced the rising generation in literature and other arts is also much clearer because of Clark's commentary. One example of influence not treated by Clark is that of Beardsley upon Faulkner, as I mentioned last year. A perusal of Noel Polk's edition of Faulkner's play The Marionettes will strengthen opinions that he fell under Beardsley's shadow. Beardsley's centrality in artistic pursuits of the nineties is obvious in Clark's pages, and another bit of evidence that he and the decade have not lost their appeal appears in Earl F. Bargainnier's "Fog and Decadence: Images of the Nineties" (JPC 12: 19-29), a fine essay ranging over many artists. Finally, Karl Beckson's edition of The Memoirs of Arthur Symons: Life and Art in the 1890's (1977) affords a useful view of the period through Symons' eyes. Because he knew everybody, great and small, his views are important. Beckson orders what was incoherent in the memoirs (much was), arranges them fairly chronologically, and provides explanatory notes. The names of Browning, Patmore, Moore, Dowson, Beardsley, Poe, and Meredith, as well as those of additional artists, literary and otherwise, are marshalled for us as they had meaning or influence during the multi-faceted final decade of the nineteenth century. If not always objective, Symons' opinions are lively, and we ought not to ignore his personal knowledge of the persons or the times. Beckson's editing is a model, and students of the period will be in his debt for this work. To conclude. The close ties of various arts are made more important in the pages of the material surveyed. The nineties was a time of breakdowns in strict generic boundaries, and all of those figures assessed moved in circles that were not confined to literature. Benvenuto, Leggett, and Clark expand the theories of Jan Gordon, expressed in talks and articles in recent years, which treat the process of miniaturizing so much a preoccupation of the nineties personae, who kept ever in mind the closing</page><page sequence="33">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN FISHER IV / 249 of the century and the waning of the Victorian age. With its sense of endings, the nineties (and after for some time) fittingly questioned traditional morality, pondered the role of language, the poet's medium, and looked ahead questioningly to the new century. Beardsley's seesawing from spare line effects to the over-decoration in something like the illustrations for The Rape of the Lock parallels Housman's, and often Dowson's, terse language and brief forms in giving us hallmarks for the contrarieties that are the essence of the decade. Swinburne Robert A. Greenberg Several essays of interest appeared during 1977 and 1978, as well as one full-length study, David G. Riede's Swinburne: A Study of Romantic Mythmaking (1978), which unfortunately came to hand too late for considered inclusion here. I must defer discussion until next year. Swinburne's style is the subject of two of the essays, and in both instances the old threadbare disparagements- diffuseness, sound separated from sense, etc.- are turned into positives. Leslie Brisman's "Swinburne's Semiotics" (GR 31 [1977]: 578-597) enters a formidable defense of the poet's prosody and recurrent use of non-mimetic language. Questioning the critical formulations of Pound and Eliot, and the simplistic word-represents-object bias they set going early in the century, Brisman argues that Swinburne's autonomy as poet lay in the imaginative space between word and object and that his most powerful effects often follow from the exploration of that area. Though analysis is limited to Atalanta in Calydon, the implications of this essay carry to much of Swinburne's work. Brisman is generally responsive to the range of Swinburne's awareness and is especially helpful in showing how his music, rather than being an end in itself or a distraction from meaning, is inseparable from the intellectual force of the poetry. Similar ground, from a different perspective, is covered in Antony H. Harrison's "Swinburne's Craft of Pure Expression" ( VN5\ [1977]: 16-20), which finds in the loose grammatical structures and expansive language of the early poetry a necessary consequence of Swinburne's effort to enlarge the possibilities of passionate expression. Harrison analyzes passages from</page><page sequence="34">250 / VICTORIAN POETRY Poems and Ballads, First Series, to illustrate the ways in which contradictory emotions (rooted in both desire and the impulse of release from desire) are given play through a texture that defeats - "suspends or dissolves" - precisely restrictive meaning. Like Brisman's, this is a suggestive essay with applicability to other of Swinburne's poems not specifically centered on the passions, as the author himself, in a closing analysis of a stanza from "The Lake of Gaube," proposes. In a separate piece, "The Aesthetics of Androgyny in Swinburne's Early Poetry" (TSL 23: 87-99), Harrison offers a brief survey of the androgyny motif in Swinburne's work, and then distinguishes between the positive and negative attitudes Swinburne brought to the theme in a discussion of, respectively, Atalanta in Calydon and "Hermaphroditus." To the extent that Atalanta is sexually neutral, she represents the androgynous ideal towards which Meleager aspires and may be contrasted with the statue contemplated in "Hermaphroditus," which embodies sexual division and hence infinite suffering and pain. It should be noted that Harrison studiously refrains from drawing biographical inferences. Swinburne's strengths as a practical critic are affirmed in Kerry McSweeney's "Swinburne's Tennyson" (VS 22: 5-28), which culls the Letters and formal criticism and manages to pull together most of Swinburne's responses to a poet he somewhat admired but more often disparaged than praised. The novelty is- and it is refreshing- that McSweeney is willing to endorse with only minor apologies Swinburne's general stance. To account for certain obvious failings or distortions, he invokes a mild version of the "anxiety of influence" principle. I would only add that whatever Swinburne's indebtedness, he possessed too vast and inclusive a literary culture (Aeschylus and Sappho to Hugo and Baudelaire) to feel very deeply anxious at having competed with Tennyson. But this is a minor concern in a solid review that may be read as a companion piece to Sidney Coulling's study several years back (PQ 39[1970]: 21 1-233) of Arnold and Swinburne. Yet another pairing of poets, with Swinburne more the theoretical than practical critic, occurs in Terry L. Meyers' "Shelley and Swinburne's Aesthetic of Melody" (PLL 14: 284-295). Swinburne's sense of Shelley's greatness never wavered, and Meyers looks to his scattered comments on the older poet in hopes of outlining an "aesthetic of lyric poetry." It is a useful effort, though what emerges is not so much an integrated theory as a series of attributes, serving almost as touchstones, by which Swinburne classified the many poets of all eras and many tongues whose lyrical impulse he admired. The scope of Swinburne's literary culture is further evidenced in David Staines' "Swinburne's Arthurian World" (SW50: 53-70). Staines is interested primarily in Swinburne's use of his sources, and he divides his</page><page sequence="35">ROBERT A. GREEN BERG / 251 discussion into three parts: early Arthuriana (treated selectively); Tristram ofLyonesse; and The Tale of Balen. But this is well-travelled territory and the author brings to it little that has not been noticed by others, beginning with Lafourcade. Mention must be made, finally, of Raleigh Trevelyan's A Pre- Raphaelite Circle, which chronicles the life and affiliations of Pauline Trevelyan, a woman of unusual quality whom Swinburne came close to revering. As his several letters to her suggest, her death early in his career deprived him of a likely powerful emotional support. Tennyson Joseph Sendry The 1978 harvest of Tennyson scholarship was the leanest in several years. It produced one book, a two-hundred-page life-and-works survey by Philip Henderson entitled Tennyson: Poet and Prophet. The life is presented largely through anecdotes; the works are represented liberally through quotation. In his preface Henderson admits that he has made no systematic study of the documents available at Lincoln (or, it could be added, elsewhere) and claims only that the book is "a personal interpretation, the record of the rediscovery of a great poet." Within these limits the book succeeds well enough. It is highly readable, if not completely reliable; its subject is distinctly drawn, if not modelled in depth. The general reader will find it a useful introduction. Given the volume of more rigorous work on the poet, the scholar can afford to pass it up. Except for some interesting remarks on Tennyson's prosody and - in the context of nineteenth-century notions of decorum - on the diction of his verse, the same advice would apply to the chapter on the poet (pp. 286- 327) in Geoffrey Tillotson's A View of Victorian Literature. As Kathleen Tillotson explains in her preface, the essays comprising this posthumous collection (the author died in 1969) were written with a view to their inclusion in a projected two-volume Victorian installment of the Oxford History of English Literature. As it stands, however, the Tennyson essay lacks the consecutive development of a chapter from the Oxford History and comes off instead as a literate, engaging appreciation weighing</page><page sequence="36">252/ VICTORIAN POETRY Tennyson's strengths as a poet against his weaknesses. The grounds for judgment are all familiar to students of the poet, and a favorable verdict is never in doubt. In a similar vein and with exemplary succinctness Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. makes the case for "Alfred Tennyson as a Poet for Our Time" (VQR 53 [1977]: 692-707)- a poet, that is, for today's general reader. On the scholarly side, one of the more substantial pieces to appear during 1978 was Michael Timko's "The Central Wish': Human Passion and Cosmic Love in Tennyson's Idyls," the opening article in the special double issue of this journal (16: 1-15) that he edited last year on the theme of "The Victorianism of Victorian Poetry." Timko's article sounded a keynote not only for that issue but also for a number of contributions to the year's work: the social, philosophical, and aesthetic concerns that Tennyson shared with his contemporaries. The "idyls" of Timko's title are of the domestic, not the Arthurian, variety, and he judges this body of verse to be of primary importance in assessing Tennyson's total performance as a poet. The key offered to the domestic idyls here is the poet's Victorian involvement in practical problems of the here and now rather than the transcendent alternatives sometimes stressed in Tennyson criticism. In Timko's view the poet locates the solution to the problems of his time in marriage and the family - a social order of man's own making that reflects his ethical values, relates him to and provides a model for civilized society, and even allows him to participate in cosmic process. Timko is particularly good on the role of women in the domestic idyl. Contrary to the stereotypes of the Victorian (and Tennysonian) female as passive and saintly, he finds the heroines of these poems to be complexly passionate and to hold primary responsibility for the success or failure of a love relationship. Timko's persuasiveness should win a new hearing for the idyllic heroines as well as a more sympathetic reading of the poems they inhabit. Kerry McSweeney's point of departure in "Swinburne's Tennyson" (VS 22: 5-28) is virtually antithetical to Michael Timko's. Whereas Timko situated Tennyson's Victorianism in his commitment to the affairs of this world, McSweeney finds that the main source of Swinburne's antagonism toward Tennyson is the latter's adherence to a doctrine of immortality that insures survival of love beyond the grave. A staunch naturalist, Swinburne believed that this life (and whatever love it offers) is all there is, and he was willing to settle for that much. Tennyson, of course, was not. Though the emphasis of the article is on the younger poet's evolving attitudes toward his senior, it throws light on significant features of Tennyson's work as well. Part of the illumination comes from Swinburne's criticism: his objections to the prolonged wavering on religious questions in In Memoriam or to Arthur's characterization in Idylls of the King. More comes from McSweeney, who is especially good on "Lucretius" and "Demeter and Persephone" as the older poet's reactions to his troublesome junior.</page><page sequence="37">JOSEPH SEN DRY I 253 McSweeney charts the complex relationship between the two poets with clarity and authority. In so doing he adds to our understanding of both poets as well as of the poetic situation in their time. That situation is the main theme of the second of three articles that delineate Tennyson's essential Victorianism by relating him to the poets who were his contemporaries, Charles Altieri's "Arnold and Tennyson: The Plight of Victorian Lyricism as Context of Modernism" {Criticism 20: 281-306). Drawing on Eliot's "dissociation of sensibility" and the split between private experience and publicly shared values described by Robert Langbaum, Altieri posits a basic tension in Victorian poetics, which it was the task of the modernists to surmount. The tension is between lyricism, the potentially uncontrolled impulse to self-expression, and rational lucidity, which implies (variously) self-awareness, contact with an objective or social world, and control. Where Tennyson is concerned, the early dramatic monologues ("The Lotos-Eaters," "Ulysses," and "Tithonus") exhibit speakers who isolate themselves from "ordinary empirical life" to give free rein to performing their feelings. "Lucretius" takes the process to its logical - if that is the word - conclusion: suicidal calm seems the only alternative to "interminable lyric self-expression." Paradoxically, Altieri sees In Memoriam and not the dramatic monologues as prefiguring the modernist emergence from Victorian lyricism. The elegist's lyric outcries lead him beyond grief to the sources of the love that caused the grief, a step toward the modernist goal of rational lucidity. Often insightful, Altieri's piece is possibly the most sophisticated criticism to appear in last year's work on Tennyson. Unfortunately for his readers, his own expression does not embody the lucidity that he admires in the modernists. In "Victorian Frames: The Windows and Mirrors of Browning, Arnold, and Tennyson" ( VP 16: 70-87) Gerhard Joseph addresses himself at once to poetic technique and the poet's perception of the world, as he interprets the significance of two key images not only for the poets named in his title but for Victorian painters as well. Joseph associates the window with each writer's limited and relative outlook on the external world and the mirror with his gaze inward, sometimes to the point of solipsism. More of the article is devoted to Browning and Arnold than to Tennyson, more to the window than to the mirror. The treatment of Tennyson subsumes and briefly extends the insights of Joseph's 1977 article in PMLA, "Tennyson's Optics: The Eagle's Gaze." Of special note in this later piece is a discussion of the epistemological importance of the Lady of Shalott's mirror. The article puts into the larger perspective of Victorian poetics what amounts to an ongoing discussion of the role that strategies of indirection (the narrative frame being a prime example) play in Tennyson's artistry. W. David Shaw and A. Dwight Culler have recently made</page><page sequence="38">254 / VICTORIAN POETRY substantial, and appreciative, contributions on this subject, as has Joseph himself. Before leaving the matter, however, a more skeptical opinion should be heard on the narrative frame enclosing at least one poem, that of H. A. Mason in "The First Setting of Tennyson's 'Morte D' Arthur'" (E&amp;S 31: 98-114). Mason finds the verses which lend a modern frame to that early-written Arthurian tale not only self-congratulatory but even diversionary. In the prefatory poem the poet includes references to his work as an epic and then affects an epic manner in the tale itself, all to conceal (Mason argues) his real concern, melancholy over Arthur Hallam's death. Mason's pesky demurs suggest that the last word has not yet been heard on Tennyson's frames. Nor has the last word been heard on Tennyson's relation, and that of his contemporary poets, to Victorian painting, another general theme that has attracted widespread attention in recent scholarship. Michael C. Kotzin's contribution to this discussion, "Tennyson and Pre-Raphaelitism: Symbolism and Point of View in 'Mariana' and The Awakening Conscience'" (Pre-Raphaelite Review 1 [1977]: 91-101) places crucial stress, as does Joseph's article, on modes of perception. Kotzin defines what he sees as an essential affinity between Tennyson's poetry and Pre-Raphaelite painting: more than a symbol of the central figure's emotions, poems such as "Mariana" and paintings such as Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience use landscape (or, more generally, setting) to reflect that figure's way of perceiving the world. Though her title suggests otherwise, Deborah Byrd Mantell's "The Princess: Tennyson's Eminently Shakesperian Poem" (TSLL 20: 48-67) effectively joins the articles by McSweeney, Altieri, and Joseph in placing the poet among his literary (though not poetic) contemporaries. The article might be entitled with equal justice ". . . Tennyson's Eminently Victorian Poem." Mantell begins by agreeing with John Killham's observation that The Princess is wholly topical in its inspiration, but she adds an amendment: in Tennyson's day Shakespeare had become a topical issue. Hence rather than comparing Shakespeare's text with Tennyson's, the article inquires what views on Shakespeare were available to a poet in mid- nineteenth-century England. Emphasizing Tennyson's allusion to The Winter's Tale in his prologue to The Princess as well as the evident similarity of that poem to Love's Labour's Lost, Mantell argues that the bard served as a model in three areas. First, the Victorians arrived at anew appreciation of the way Shakespeare achieved unity even when, as in the tragicomedies and late romances, he combined disparate dramatic modes (thus, The Princess as a "medley"). Second, critics of the 1830's and 1840's asserted the primacy of character over plot in Shakespeare (and so the thin plot of The Princess). Finally, the critics also stressed the vitality of Shakespeare's heroines at the expense of his heroes (hence not only the relative strength of Tennyson's princess and the weakness of his prince but</page><page sequence="39">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 255 also the feminist slant of the poem). At one point Mantell concedes that the ideas of a critic whom Tennyson could not have known directly were "in the air" and therefore available to him at least indirectly. The remark suggests both the value and the limits of the essay. As a study of the literary milieu in which Tennyson wrote, Mantell's article is well researched and convincing. As a statement on the way in which the poet shaped this specific work, it is inconclusive, for it assumes too readily that he did know what the evidence merely shows he could have known. Problems with the attribution of influence surface again in Ian H. C. Kennedy's article, "Alfred Tennyson's Bildungsgang: Notes on His Early Reading" (PQ 57: 82-103), which centers on the undergraduate poet's interest in German literature. Like Mantell, Kennedy convincingly sketches an intellectual milieu, here the enthusiasm for German writing shared by Tennyson's fellow "Apostles" at Cambridge. Our poet's particular passion is seen to be Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Wilhelm Meister's Travels, available in English through Carlyle's translations in 1824 and 1827 respectively. The key exhibit in the case for his knowledge of these Goethean works is a phrase from Chapter VIII of the Travels', "the Confessions of some mind not yet in unity with itself," a likely source for the Tennysonian title, "Supposed Confessions . . . . " Kennedy also has some intriguing observations on the Apprenticeship as a source for "Mariana," but he stretches his general point through an over- willingness to hear echoes of Goethe in other poems where parallels are much less distinct. The final section of the article, dealing with Bulwer- Lytton's Falkland, maintains only a tenuous connection (through the Bildungsroman) with what precedes. Tennyson's acquaintance with at least part of that novel is, thanks to the Memoir, firmly established, but not so the connections with a number of poems for which Kennedy nominates Falkland as source. As Kennedy's article illustrates, the usual way to begin a study of the influences on a writer is by ascertaining what he has read. Anyone seeking an overview of Tennyson's reading would be well advised to start with Susan Shatto's essay, "Tennyson's Library" (BC 27: 494-513), a survey of the poet's own collection now housed at the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln. (The next step, of course, would be to consult Volume I of Nancie Campbell's catalogue of the collection, Tennyson in Lincoln.) Shatto summarizes the main subject areas in which Tennyson acquired books (whether by purchase, as gifts, or by importuning friends): natural history, astronomy, geology and evolution, religion and philosophy, and literature - the last broken down further into subclasses. But the essay is more than an annotated list. It sketches major shifts in Tennyson's reading tastes over a lifetime, his habits as a reader (after boyhood he seldom annotated his books), and his practice as a collector. Reflecting close</page><page sequence="40">256/ VICTORIAN POETRY acquaintance with the Lincoln Collection, of which she had charge for a time, Shatto's essay is pithy with information and precise in bibliographical detail. It is at the same time highly readable and handsomely illustrated. Shatto's familiarity with Tennyson bibliography bears additional fruit in her article, "Tennyson's Revisions of In Memoriam" (VP 16: 341-356). Focusing on some of the most heavily revised sections (XXXI, XXXII, LIX, CXXIII, CXXIV, CXXVIII, and CXXX), she compares their versions in the manuscripts, the trial issue, and early editions. Aside from the general principle that as he revised the poet became less personal and direct in references to himself and Hallam, the comparison mainly reveals subtle changes in texture which do not lend themselves easily to summary. This is the first systematic attempt since the Trinity papers were released in 1 969 to draw on the whole body of known manuscripts for a detailed close- up of the craftsmanship of In Memoriam. The delay suggests the difficulty involved in the task, which is here ably performed. Another essay on the Hallam elegy, James Kilroy's "The Chiastic Structure of In Memoriam, A. H. H.," which appears in the 1977 volume of PQ (56: 358-373) merits notice (albeit tardy) here. As a solution to the persistent problem of how the individual sections of the elegy are related to each other, Kilroy proposes the chiasmus, a structure in which parallel units are presented in reverse order. The major elements forming the chiastic structure of In Memoriam are "nine natural groups" of sections that Tennyson distinguished for James Knowles late in his life. As with the Greek letter chi (X), Kilroy sees our attention drawn to a central point, the fifth or middle member of the nine groups (L-LVIII), where the poem reaches its nadir in the vision of "nature red in tooth and claw." One can readily accept Kilroy's characterization of the In Memoriam stanza with its abba rhymes as chiastic, since its elements, four lines of iambic tetrameter, are of coordinate magnitude. The nine groups are another matter. Disregarding the unlikelihood that anyone would have arrived at this division of the poem without the poet's prompting, the scheme falters because the elements that comprise it are scarcely of similar magnitude. Thus, Kilroy must begin his argument by attempting to balance a group of eight sections (I-VIII) with one of twenty-eight (CIV-CXXXI), and those of considerable thematic diversity. Moreover, so much of the essay is given over to running paraphrase that the main thread of argument becomes obscure. If wrong-headed, Kilroy's formulation is ingenious, and it does put us in a position to see some parallels in Tennyson's elegy that might otherwise go unnoticed. In the same 1977 volume of PQ (56: 241-245) appears the text of a paper delivered by James R. Kincaid at the 1975 meeting of the Midwest Modern Language Association under the title "Tennyson's Ironic Camelot: Arthur Breathes His Last." Users of the year's work may find</page><page sequence="41">JOSEPH SEN DRY / 257 useful this cogent summary of the position on the Idylls that Kincaid expounds at sixty-three pages' length in his 1975 book, Tennyson: The Comic and Ironic Patterns. The last study awaiting consideration here is the most thoroughgoing effort by a Tennyson scholar in 1978 to discern a thread of continuity underlying the poet's career: Priscilla Johnston's "Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme: Memory and the 'Good Solid' Past" ( TSLL 20: 68-92). Between the translation of Claudian's De Raptu Proserpinae, written at age 14, and "Demeter and Persephone," published at age 80, Johnston finds recurrent adumbrations of this myth in the Tennyson canon: several of the English idyls, the two "Locksley Hall" poems, In Memoriam, and Maud among others. Four stages of the myth are distinguished: an ideal past imaged by pastoral landscapes and associated with Persephone; a violent ("apocalyptic") break with that past through some visionary experience (the entrance of Aidoneus); the barren present in which the survivor (Demeter) "tries to recover the lost past and all it symbolizes"; and a "qualified restoration" to the original state, which in turn is threatened by further disruption. A standard objection to mythic interpretations - that they often reduce highly individualized works to archetypal caricatures - can be brought against this one. "Love and Duty," for example, becomes a version of the "rape myth" with "social Duty" cast as the King of Death. Though Johnston sometimes rides her thesis too hard, her sensitivity to implication and her ability to follow through on an argument are such that even with reservations about her method and its application, one is likely to find a great deal of value in her work. In the first place, her fresh and intelligent reading of "Demeter and Persephone" (which she sees as having an ambiguous ending) will have to be reckoned with by all future commentators on the poem. Secondly, she has perceived new resonances in Tennyson's larger treatment of the myth itself. The most striking of these is the centrality that he accords the Demeter figure, the survivor through whose consciousness the catastrophic loss is presented. In her attempt to recover the past through memory Demeter can thus be taken to represent the poet. Finally, the author does succeed in identifying a constellation of meanings that recur in Tennyson's work: distinctive views of time, change, memory, and vision. Johnston thinks Tennyson may have found the Demeter and Persephone myth more imaginatively congenial than even the Christian message, for it offered a set of alternatives, hopeful or pessimistic depending on where the emphasis is laid - on Persephone's restoration to Demeter or on her return to the underworld. Not the least of the virtues of Johnston's article is that it will provoke us to further thought.</page></plain_text>
