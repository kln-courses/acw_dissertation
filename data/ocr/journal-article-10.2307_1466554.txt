<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancestors before Us: Manifestations of Tradition in a Hawaiian Dispute Greg Johnson Is it sacred or secular? Was it used for ritual purposes in the past? How would it be used for ritual purposes in the present? Such are the ques- tions raised by a recent dispute over a Hawaiian object (ki'i). The dis- pute erupted when a group of Hawaiian representatives discovered that the Roger Williams Museum intended to sell the object in question. Hawaiians sought repatriation of the ki'i under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), and the dispute was heard twice by the NAGPRA Review Committee. This article explores the dispute and analyzes discourses of "tradition" utilized by both parties. Primary attention is paid to Hawaiians' claims, particularly the way in which they linked aspects of cultural history to present conflicts concern- ing land issues and sovereignty. Engaging recent literature concerning the theorization of tradition in the Pacific, the article concludes by arguing that Hawaiian claims about the ki'i, though seemingly spurious at points, express the suppleness of tradition in ways that move beyond the mere invention of tradition, provoking us to contemplate traditional sources of novelty. THIS ARTICLE CONCERNS A Hawaiian ki'i or "image." The ki'i was recently the object of a dispute between the Roger Williams Museum of the City of Providence, Rhode Island, and a group of Hawaiians repre- sented by Hui Malama I Na Kapuna 'O Hawai'i Nei and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Most likely manufactured in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, the object is a stout anthropomorphic figurine that stands about two feet tall, has a smooth blue head, and once had eyes of Greg Johnson is an assistant professor of religious studies at Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA 17604-3003.

The object was clearly designed to be a canoe- mounted support apparatus of some sort, as it incorporates a sizable triple rack.' But just what it carried is a matter of some dispute. Did it carry fish- ing poles or sacred spears? This dispute is metonymic of a larger issue: Was the object designed and used for secular or religious purposes? The dispute first erupted in 1996, when Hawaiian representatives learned that the museum was attempting to sell the object via Sotheby's. They pressed a repatriation claim under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA),2 declaring that the figure was a sacred ob- ject. The museum resisted this claim vigorously, insisting that the object was merely utilitarian. Thus at an impasse, the dispute went before the NAGPRA Review Committee.3 In fact, the dispute was reviewed twice, first in 1996 and again in 1997.4 What follows is an analysis of the dispute, with an eye to how each side represented the object. First, however, we turn to set up the discussion in broad theoretical terms. Through analyzing claims about the object, we are taking on a much larger and general question: Namely, what is the relationship of "tradition" to change and novelty? Of course, this is a classic chestnut in the study of religion and culture. As elsewhere, scholars of Hawaii, and Oceania more broadly, have addressed this issue in recent decades with illuminating if 1 For a photograph of this object, see Dodd: 235. Dodd's description of the ki'i merits quoting at length, as it prefigures much of the discussion at hand and is almost as colorful as the subtitle of his book--A Pictorial Peregrination through the Shapely and Harmonious Often Enigmatical Some- times Shocking Realms ofPolynesian Art: "This curious, though undoubtedly authentic pre-European piece is a triple spear rest for an Hawaiian chief, designed to be lashed to the gunwhale of his war canoe. Its singularity is that the body is carved in a style traditional to god images, and one would not expect a god to be performing such menial labor even for a great chief. But the head is more reminiscent of the menehune tradition which would be quite appropriate. This then seems to be a mixture of traditions; something quite rare in Polynesia" (235). 2 Public Law 101-601 (25 U.S.C. 3001, 1990). Passed into law in 1990, NAGPRA is fundamen- tally a form of human rights legislation designed to allow for the protection of Native American, Alaskan, and Hawaiian human remains and cultural objects on public land and the repatriation of human remains and several categories of cultural objects from federally funded institutions. Of central interest to scholars of religion are two related arenas of religious discourse: (1) the law re- lies heavily on religious language in its definitions (e.g., sacred object, ritual use, and traditional re- ligious leader), and (2) responding to this language, native representatives have become adept at framing their repatriation concerns in the law's terms. Moreover, the law stipulates that oral tradi- tion and other genres of nonscientific claims have equal standing with scientific claims regarding pivotal issues surrounding the relationship of contemporary claimants to historical objects. 3 Authors of the legislation provided a pre-legal forum for contentious issues to be addressed by stipulating the creation of a Review Committee. The committee is constituted by seven members, three of whom are chosen by Native American, Alaskan, and Hawaiian representatives, and three, by scientific and museums interests, with the final member being selected jointly by way of a rec- ommendation from the initial six appointees. 4 The first hearing was at the Review Committee meeting #12 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on 3 November 1996. The second hearing was at Review Committee meeting #13 in Norman, Oklahoma, on 27 March 1997.</page><page sequence="3">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 329 not harmonious results. Aside from the heated dispute between Marshall Sahlins and Gananath Obeyesekere concerning the apotheosis of Captain Cook, much of the literature emerging from the Pacific is not widely known in religious studies.5 We do well to acquaint ourselves with this literature, for "tradition" is the central theoretical concern of these au- thors. Some, disenchanted by historicist trends, have focused on the nature of continuity, while others have made quite the opposite move, addressing the problem of discontinuity and the so-called invention of traditions. Not surprisingly, those who would emphasize continuity appeal to the endur- ance of cultural structures, the configuring capacity of culturally unique ontologies, and the signal importance of cultural relativism (e.g., Sahlins 1985, 1988, 1993; Schieffelin and Crittenden). For their part, those who em- phasize discontinuity dwell on the effect of historical forces, power relation- ships, and, whether explicitly or not, putatively universal human tendencies to maximize profit from whatever sources of capital happen to be available (Bergendorff, Hasager, and Henriques; Friedman; Obeyesekere). Other scholars have self-consciously worked to bridge the positions, recognizing that elements of both obtain when culture, history, and politics fuse to be- come tradition (e.g., Jolly and Thomas; Keesing and Tonkinson; Linnekin 1983, 1990, 1991; Thomas 1991, 1997; Wasserman). While some of the foremost scholars of religion have long sought to work through the dialectics of history and culture, it does seem that we have something to learn from such contexts as contemporary Hawaii, even if this amounts to remembering rather old lessons about the pliability of religions and regaining respect for the practiced flexibility of tradition. In other words, we are called again to recognize that traditions can be far more labile than our entrenched interpretive tools normally allow. In any event, scholars of religion can contribute to this arena of study through our close attention to detail. If sometimes myopic, we tend to home in on key symbols in ways that allow us to perceive and track the nuances of traditions in action. Moreover, our habit of studying textual traditions has yielded analytical insights that can be applied with profit elsewhere, namely, that all symbols are necessarily polyvalent, even synchronically conceived, this because all symbols are texts with a multiplicity of audiences, all of which have different-sometimes diametric-interests. How more so this is the case as symbols move through time. In short, "authorial" intention--be it priestly control of a ritual or a museum's control of an object-is no guarantee of a symbol's meaning. 5 I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer who pointed out the irony of this point, given that many of the foundational conceptual tools in religious studies were borrowed from early studies of Oceania (e.g., taboo, mana, totem, etc.).</page><page sequence="4">330 Journal of the American Academy of Religion So it is with such a view that I want to describe the dispute at hand, working finally to argue that symbols-indeed, tradition-are far more supple than many observers would allow. In saying this, however, I am not appealing only to the notion of "invented traditions" (Hobsbawm and Ranger). Rather, my goal is to specify traditional sources of novelty along with the novel sources of tradition. To do so, I first outline the basic ele- ments of the Hawaiians' claim and the relevant statutory bases to which it appeals. Next I consider briefly the museum's position. Then I attend more closely to the Hawaiians' case, with particular interest in ways an- cestors and warfare figure into their discourse. Finally, I place these themes in conversation with descriptions of ancient Hawaiian religion in order to track the way in which strangers are domesticated and tradition is modified in the service of itself. CASE BACKGROUND AND HAWAIIAN CLAIM As I have described elsewhere (see Johnson), Hawaiians were involved in repatriation issues from an early date and continue to be among the most active groups in pressing repatriation claims. It is not surprising, then, that they were quick to act when they learned of the Roger Wil- liams Museum's intentions to sell the object in question. Representa- tives invoked NAGPRA and specifically asserted that the law allows triple protection of the object as (1) a funerary item, (2) an item of cultural patrimony, and (3) a sacred object. The former two claims failed to move forward and need not detain us here. The third claim, however, suc- ceeded in large measure. After both reviews of the dispute, the Review Committee issued findings in favor of the Hawaiians' claim on these grounds. However, the committee's finding led to an even greater threat of dispute. The museum pressed suit against the committee on consti- tutional grounds, asserting that the finding and the law itself violate fun- damental principles of the First Amendment with regard to the separation of church and state.6 Thus, this dispute was situated to become one of the first major tests of the law. But before this transpired, the parties settled out of court, with the Hawaiians taking control of the object and agree- 6 Drafters of the legislation struggled with the ways NAGPRA might steer clear of a complex his- tory of First Amendment precedents that walk a fine-and shifting-line between free exercise and establishment issues. In sum, legislators worked with various Indian, Alaskan, and Hawaiian rep- resentatives to craft language and standards designed to satisfy potential judicial tests. Chief among their goals was to arrive at definitions that would be recognizable to the court as approximating the common formulation for constitutional protection, namely, that something is "central and essential" to a religion. The definition of sacred object (below) is the result of this process (on the legislative history, see, e.g., U.S. House of Representatives; U.S. Senate 1987, 1988, 1990).</page><page sequence="5">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 331 ing to make a "donation" to the museum (Museum of Natural History). As I read the situation, advocates of the law perceived a danger in having this case tested, as the current judiciary might have found less merit in the Hawaiians' claims than the Review Committee had. Moreover, the judiciary would be weighing another issue as well, one as sacred to Ameri- can law as religion but better protected by it: private property interests and the "takings clause" of the Fifth Amendment. In any case, to return to the Hawaiians' claim, they deftly described how the object fits the law's description of sacred object, which reads as follows: "'Sacred objects' shall mean specific ceremonial objects which are needed by traditional Native American religious leaders for the prac- tice of traditional Native American religions by their present day adher- ents" (25 U.S.C. 3001 Sec. 2). This idiosyncratic definition of "sacred object" rests on two primary features: (1) demonstration of traditional religious authority and (2) contemporary ritual use. The Final Rule and Regulations for the law further complicate the definition with the addi- tion of a critical word, renewal: "[Sacred objects are those] objects that were devoted to a traditional Native American religious ceremony or ritual and which have religious significance or function in the renewal of such ceremony" (Federal Register 60/232). Inclusion of this poten- tially contentious language revealed a yet wider and more densely fea- tured interpretive horizon. Emphasis on renewal suggests that not only the "past" but also the present and future will be weighed in delibera- tions regarding purportedly sacred objects. Moreover, renewal language entails a direct reference to the legislative history during which various native representatives and numerous legislators explicitly and repeat- edly stated a hope that ritual renewal would lead to broad cultural renewal. In the context of these definitions, and by way of introducing the Hawaiian claims, consider an excerpt from the testimony of Edward Haleloha Ayau as he described why the ki'i is a "sacred object": As far as we are concerned, this is a competition. What is at stake is a ki'i that once housed a powerful 'aumakua. ... For us, this ki'i is the same as iwi. It's the same as bone. The name that we chose for ourselves, Na Oiwi 0 Hawai 'i Nei, we are the bone of Hawai'i. We are Hawai'i. In our bones are our spirits. And in the bones of our ancestors are their spirits. This ki'i had the same function. It was used to house the spirit of an ancestor.... Consecration of the ki'i occurred when the 'aumakua was called for- ward and was called to-to dwell in the ki'i. The 'aumakua was then fed. The ki'i was fed. And then the ki'i was directed to provide the service. The idea is, in Hawaiian thought, just because you die doesn't end your role in the family. For some, it enhanced it....</page><page sequence="6">332 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The next ceremony that was conducted included the consecration of the ki'i as a war weapon. ... Warriors consecrated their weapons to seek lokahi between their gods and themselves to assure success in war. Ongoing ceremonies by living descendants may be conducted to call upon the 'aumakua, to call the 'aumakua back. ... The ongoing signifi- cance for this ki'i, especially for descendants of these ruling chiefs, is to be able to reactivate them, to ask for the same kind of strength and knowl- edge needed in modern-day confrontations. .... The 'aumakua that is summoned through use of the ki'i could be called upon to help sharpen our minds, our tongues, and the spirit of contemporary Hawaiian warriors. (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 51-52) As I will argue, such testimony represents a remarkable welding of tradi- tional concepts, present interests, and legal language. Most relevant to highlight here is that the object is asserted to be an 'aumakua object or an object capable of housing ancestral spirits. More specifically, it is identi- fied as the vessel of an ancestor chief whose spirit might help Hawaiians in their contemporary battles, even, we will see, in the battle to return the object itself. THE MUSEUM: NO APOLOGIES FOR TYPOLOGIES Museum representatives argued that the figure was merely secular and was not sacred in any capacity. Their position was articulated with refer- ence to an uncomplicated past: a time before the present, now departed and fixed, that should not be impinged on by counterclaims in the present. In the first review of the dispute a museum representative asserted flatly that "our object does not exhibit the characteristics of an 'aumakua. How- ever, it does exhibit the characteristics of a utilitarian support figure" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 65). More specifically, she stated that the object was not war related at all but was a support mechanism used to hold fishing spears. The representative's next move was to cast a threat to the Review Committee: We believe, as well, that should this Review Committee make a decision that this particular support figure should be repatriated to Hawaii, you will have expanded the NAGPRA guidelines dramatically, and well be- yond the intention of the drafters and, indeed, of the Congress. ... We believe it would open a Pandora's box where literally any object now held by any museum could be repatriated, however inferential or speculative the evidence. (1996: 68) The next museum representative stated that none of the museum's staff present at the meeting had a background in anthropology. "For that</page><page sequence="7">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 333 reason," she continued, "the museum has sought the expert advice of a universally-recognized scholar in this type of Hawaiian sculpture," Dr. William Davenport (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 70). Already here, in the very choice of authorizing claims and strategies, we see the museum's tactic emerging: to represent its position as one based on puta- tively universal and scientific truths vis-a-vis local and political interests. Developing her position, the representative set up an implicit opposition between kinds of knowledge: "My feeling is-is that what the Board and probably what the National Park Service, overall, needs to consider, is what is the relative weight, in fact, going to be between available, existing, schol- arly literature, categories, typologies versus what documentation and data might be provided to us by members of Native Hawaiian organizations and Native American groups overall" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 76). Drawing her comments to a close, she asserted baldly that the mu- seum accepted Dr. Davenport's scholarly opinion "that our figure is a support figure that was not used in any ritualistic way" (NAGPRA Re- view Committee 1996: 78). The next museum representative presented a slide show intended to explicate the museum's contention that the object was not and could not be sacred. Showing a slide of the figure, she appealed to "the physicality of the object itself' (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 79). On the basis of this "physicality" she asserted that the object could not have been an 'aumakua figure. Specifically, she noted the object's purportedly support- like characteristics, which, in her view, demonstrate the object's utilitarian nature. In a nutshell form this was the museum's argument: support = utili- tarian = nonsacred. This equation, of course, is redolent of long-held and long-analyzed traditions of western dichotomization. The representative continued to make her case, reciting a variety of characteristics that indi- cate the object's utilitarian aspect, including a rack appendage and mount by which it would have been attached to a canoe. From these features she deduced that "it's very, very clearly form-function designed" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 81). Following upon this declaration, she sought to defuse assertions that the object resembles other known 'aumakua fig- ures. She quoted Davenport: "These support figures have an ingenuity, a composition, charm, and informal treatment that is completely lacking in the better-known religious images" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 83). Here we have another expression of a dichotomy: sacred = serious = fixed versus secular = playful = malleable. Continuing to develop her cat- egorization, she showed numerous slides of figures and typified them ac- cording to their correspondence with the aforementioned characteristics. Imagine being shown fifty slides, half of which resembled the object in ques- tion and half of which did not. When the presenter concludes, telling you</page><page sequence="8">334 Journal of the American Academy of Religion that you have witnessed the difference between the profane and the sacred, it would be understandably difficult to step back and remind oneself of the constructive process by which the division was promoted. Thus went the museum's testimony at the first hearing. As noted, the Review Committee was not swayed and recommended repatriation. Re- sponding to this, the museum came back at the second hearing with a dark- suited attorney leading the charge. In his opening comments he declared, "We believe that the issue is one which must in the final analysis be driven by evidence" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 10). With that, he called his first expert, Dr. Adrienne Kaeppler, the curator of Oceanic ethnology at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institu- tion. Regarding the object's sacredness, she stated that "it appears, of course, to be a spear rest." Continuing, she made the following remarks about the nature of 'aumakua figures: "What I have heard from Hawai- ians in the past is that ... these were primarily places into which to call the gods. They were a vehicle for bringing the gods, a place to rest, a rest- ing place for them; that they were not actually the gods; that they were a place into which you called the gods" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 32). These observations were meant, it would seem, to show the transi- tory nature of sacredness in Hawaiian religious traditions. Sacredness, as Dr. Kaeppler presented it, is not a quality of objects but, rather, a state any object might obtain should a spirit be called into it or, as she said, activated. Her assertions are thus cast in the service of distinguishing be- tween the sacred and its possible vessels, with the conclusions that (1) no object is therefore inherently sacred and (2) many objects could, in prin- ciple, suffice for activating the sacred. On the face of it, these claims ap- pear damaging to the Hawaiians' case. However, by emphasizing the role of activation, of ritual activity, Dr. Kaeppler preserved for the Hawaiians a point to elaborate and turn to their advantage. This would prove cru- cial to the Hawaiians' case. Indeed, the museum's attorney seemed to perceive that the testimony of his star witness was perilously close to backfiring. To shore up the situa- tion, he pressed Dr. Kaeppler to state that the object was and is not sa- cred. Despite his leading questions, Dr. Kaeppler offered more "friendly fire." Responding to his question as to whether or not the object was sacred, she said: "But in itself, in my opinion, it is not a sacred figure. But you could call something to it to make it sacred, just as you could do that to a plain block of wood, if it is the right kind of wood, on a heiau" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 34). The formal vagueness of her claim shifted the burden back to the museum to demonstrate that it was not, in fact, used in this way. Negative claims would prove hard to come by for the museum's attorney.</page><page sequence="9">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 335 Clearly frustrated, the attorney called his next presenter, Herb Kane, an artist and canoe builder. Introducing Mr. Kane, it was clear that the attorney wanted to establish that the museum had the support of native Hawaiians. But here again his intentions were subtly foiled: Attorney: Mr. Kane, before you go on, are-are you a Native Hawaiian? Herb Kane: I'm part Hawaiian, yes. Attorney: Now- Herb Kane: We're all part Hawaiian these days. (NAGPRA Review Com- mittee 1997: 43) But Mr. Kane's presentation quickly turned more favorable to the mu- seum. He characterized the Hawaiians' claim with this analogy: "It's like they're going after a pickup truck and trying to turn it into a Cadillac" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 45). Upon development, however, his position revealed a weakness that the Hawaiians would capitalize on and to which I will return in the conclusion. Specifically, he argued that the object is no longer needed for religious purposes because formal reli- gion is no longer practiced in Hawaii. The next presenter called by the museum was Ms. Rubellite Kawena Johnson, a scholar-in-residence at the Kawananakoa Foundation and professor emeritus at the University of Hawaii. Beyond her academic cre- dentials, Ms. Johnson described herself as a "Hawaiian religious leader" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 62). Furthermore, she directed the committee to her resume, specifically to the fact that she was a founder of the Council of Hawaiian Elders under the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. On these bases, she has insider (native and religious) authority, outsider (aca- demic) authority, and, significantly, authority with reference to one of the opposing groups, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. She stated unequivocally that "the object is not needed by religious leaders today, because that object was used as a canoe rest" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 70). Liking the sound of this, the attorney jumped in to direct his witness: Attorney: Let me just end by giving you a hypothetical. I want you to as- sume that I have a carved 'aumakua and I call a certain spirit into that 'aumakua. Do you have that in mind? Rubellite Johnson: Yes. I'm-I'm listening to you. Attorney: Okay. And let's assume that I lose that carved figure. In your opinion, will I have the-will I be able to call the spirit that I called into my lost 'aumakua into another animate object? Rubellite Johnson: Yes. It's-it's possible to carve an entirely new image and to call the spirit into it. The-the wood does not have the spirit.... You're-you're always in control of the spiritual source of your 'aumakua. So you can move that spirit into the element which you designate to re- ceive communication with that spirit.</page><page sequence="10">336 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Attorney: So in your opinion, it is not necessary for me to have in my possession the lost 'aumakua for me to worship the spirit that is- Rubellite Johnson: No. You don't have to have the object, because the spirit is the real thing. The object is not. Attorney: Thank you very much. ... Enjoy your day, thank you so much. (NAGPRA Review Committee 1997: 77) Now, I was present at this hearing, and I can tell you that there was a palpable sense in the room that the Hawaiians were doomed. After such a seemingly devastating presentation, in which academic and cultural authorities rejected claims as to the object's possible ritual use and sacred status, I wondered how the Hawaiians could possibly respond. I do not think I was alone in my underestimation of tradition in action. THE HAWAIIANS: ANCESTORS BEFORE US The first thing the Hawaiians did was to pray aloud as a group, chanting Hawaiian in a manner that unmistakably conveyed reverence and gravity. Such a moment could be dismissed as empty gesturing; in my view, how- ever, it succinctly encapsulates and foreshadows the Hawaiians' position. Before even speaking an English word they had made the bedrock assertion that their claims rested upon: they are religious people, and this is a religious dispute. To establish themselves thus was tantamount to leveraging the high- est possible authority, situating themselves at the top of an implicit hierar- chy that NAGPRA-related events had established, within which religious speech is taken to be the highest claim on "truth." Much of the remainder of their presentation would be a sustained project of adding substance, ex- ample, and texture to the formal claim established by their public prayer.7 7 To be clear about my analytical trajectory, I consider the central category in question here, "the sacred," to be problematic. That is, while I am prepared to grant that Hawaiian representatives be- lieve the object to be sacred, my analysis begins with the proposition that "the sacred" is always and everywhere a human construct and is most usefully analyzed as such. This is not meant to be a cyni- cal move on my part, nor is it meant to suggest that the Hawaiians' religious claim was merely a ploy. Rather, the spirit of my analysis is to shed light upon the very processes by which "tradition" remains vital, and these processes tend to be most active in conflict situations wherein meanings are anything but stable and everything but given. I have much the same to say about the category of "sovereignty." For decades various Hawaiian groups have been agitating for "sovereignty," and disputes concern- ing land rights and repatriation have figured prominently in their efforts. However, these struggles have been far from unified in terms of constituencies and aims. NAGPRA presents a delicate situa- tion here, as the law is quite pointedly that of a nation-state managing internal relations. Thus, Ha- waiian groups, like Indian nations, must concede sovereignty in a maximal sense in order to come under the purview of the law. In this context, various Hawaiian groups have divergent views of NAGPRA. Some groups, like the Sovereign Hawaiian Nation, have not attempted to press claims under the law for the very reason that to do so would imply that they have compromised the integrity of their claim to be sovereign. Other groups, for example, Hui Malama I Na Kapuna 'O Hawai'i Nei, have been involved with NAGPRA since its legislative inception.</page><page sequence="11">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 337 The Hawaiians' representation of indigenous authority--what I have called minority-specific authority (Johnson)-was carried forward by their first representative to speak, Linda Kawai'Ono Delaney of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Before introducing herself, she addressed the audience in Hawaiian, staking a claim to Hawaiianness and indicating, however subtly, that correct understanding is dependent on native knowledge, which is most palpably expressed through speech performance. Switch- ing to English, Ms. Delaney spoke in a notably religious and cultural key, tacking back and forth from present to past: We have traveled 6,000 miles to join you and to assure that the mana, or spiritual power, of the ki'i 'aumakua, or ancestral (Native Hawaiian lan- guage), will rejoin us.... We are accustomed to long voyages, having sailed tens of thousands of miles to settle and make our homes on the scattered Islands of the Pacific.... [W]e are heirs to a civilization which spanned the largest geo- graphic area in human experience.... The disruptions and the destructions of those years [from European contact to the current time] left a people dispossessed and dispirited. Now, we stand to reclaim and return to our rightful stewardship; our bones, our ancestors, our Gods, the lands, and the self-determination of the Hawaiian people. Throughout our existence in the brightest and the darkest days, we have known we were one people. We are of one placenta, sustained by shared genealogy and shared descendants. When we are most vulnerable, we call on the strongest of our ancestors, the 'aumakua. (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 33-35) With stunning verve Ms. Delaney trampled the tidy boundaries of NAGPRA and commonplace notions of tradition and the sacred. Her language re- cast the terms of the debate altogether, moving it from a narrow discus- sion concerning the function of one object to an expansive account of Hawaiian religion, history, and sovereignty. Establishing the leading front of what would become an exhaustive assault, Ms. Delaney captured our attention with her confident, even bold, handling of "tradition." She did not shy away from invoking tradition metaphorically; indeed, this is her most jarring tactic. She announced that her people are used to traveling far to settle: her ancestors sailed the Pacific to settle the islands; today she had traveled far to settle this matter. Likewise, she invoked bodily terms metaphorically to link contemporary Hawaiians to their putative ances- tors: we are of one placenta. With such claims Ms. Delaney was also ad- vancing a political agenda unapologetically. The dispute over the object, she made clear, cannot be considered independently from Hawaiian po- litical contexts, for the ki'i, the ancestors, and the land are intimately re- lated to the quest for Hawaiian sovereignty.</page><page sequence="12">338 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The next Hawaiian representative to speak was Lani Ma'a Lapilio. Ms. Lapilio gave this explanation of the object in question: "The eyes are an outstanding feature. ... The Hawaiians saw the eyes, the pearl eyes, as all- seeing and all-knowing, enabling the ki'i la'au to be able to see-have clear vision of the battle field. ... The upraised left hand signifies that the spears are ready for battle, and again, the eyes would reflect the lights to-to blind his enemy" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 38). Having described the warrior-god characteristics of the spirit who putatively could be called into the object, the onus on Ms. Lapilio was to turn her discussion to address the limiting terms of NAGPRA. She filled legal definitions with Hawaiian concepts, describing the figure as a "sacred object" used in consecration ceremonies as the chiefs prepared for battle. And in these ceremonies, the ki'i 'aumakua served as a conduit to the gods. And when the 'aumakua was called upon through prayer and praise, it was the akua, or God, who would imbue the spear with mana, or life forces and en- ergy..... The strength of our Hawaiian nation was in the familial cycle of human life. And-and this practice has survived, despite the overthrow of our government. And this is the depth and the foundation of-of our culture that has survived throughout. (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 38-39) The next Hawaiian representative to speak was Kunani Nihipali, the po'o (head) of Hui Malama. His testimony was remarkable in a number of ways. In particular, his "opening prayer" was a tour de force: We call upon our ancestors from the sun's rising to the sun's setting. We call upon our ancestors to spin and stand at our back and our front. We call upon our ancestors to stand at the right side of us. For we are your children; safeguard us, that we may grow in the heavens, that we may grow on the earth, that we may flourish in the land of our birth. Grant us the intelligence. Grant us the understanding. Grant us the avenue of communication. Grant us good energy. Grant us your spiritual guidance and assistance. Be kind to us who are burdened. Pardon our cer- emonial faults. Pardon our weaknesses of the heart. Pardon our unfulfill- ment ofvows. Pardon our speech impediments. Let your anger be appeased by our humility this day. Look upon us with favor. Grant us life in the true Hawaiian sense. Awaken within us the true depth of this work. Allow us to become one in mind, only then will we go forward in strength, in humil- ity, and understanding. We are your children, your descendants. For that which is above shall be brought down. For that which is below shall be lifted up. Our islands will again be united. Our walls shall once again rise and stand upright. (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 42-43) The combined force and economy of Mr. Nihipali's words are so mov- ing that it might not have occurred to the audience that the disputed ob-</page><page sequence="13">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 339 ject had not even been mentioned. Hawaiianness as a value, not the dis- puted object, is the focus of the prayer.8 Specifically, Mr. Nihipali was giving an account of the religious and political rectitude of Hawaiians. Once established, this cosmological depiction of Hawaiians would be condensed and restated with regard to the disputed object. The argument would then proceed by asking the committee to assent to claims about the object on the basis of demonstrated religious authenticity and the credibility this confers. To this end, Mr. Nihipali's rhetoric was brilliant. Double meanings, metaphors, and inversions are met within every sentence. Just prior to the quoted section, he established an affiliation with Native Americans and their ancestors, implicitly adding the moral weight of their histories to his cause. The manner by which he called on Hawaiian ancestors was likewise inge- nious, as he spoke of them "before us." The double significance here is tell- ing: the ancestors are "before us" in the chronological (usual) sense, which serves as a reminder of and an homage to their history; but they are also "before us" in the sense of standing in front of the Hawaiians in the present, as leaders and defenders. Next, Mr. Nihipali's prayer presents various im- ages of homage and deference toward the gods and ancestors, for example, "Grant us the intelligence. ... Be kind to us who are burdened." Herein we see also the discourse of humility, for example, "Pardon our ... faults.... Pardon our... impediments." Whatever else this language accomplishes, it taps into a classic western trope wherein God's attributes are character- ized as inversions of human imperfections. It also affords a way to preempt accusations of incomplete knowledge and cultural incompetence that might be leveled by the museum. Mr. Nihipali's next move was to call forth sentiments of affiliation, to call people to a higher level of connection-one that includes the land and ancestors and is beyond petty factionalism and, most significantly, the non-Hawaiian world. Just who is legitimately Hawaiian is not explicitly addressed. This is notable given how thorny questions of ethnicity have become in the context of contemporary Hawaiian sovereignty movements. Here the problem of belonging is implicitly resolved: those who care about 8 As with "the sacred" and "sovereignty," the category of "Hawaiian" as a cultural and ethnic marker is not taken as signaling an uncontested core identity. Rather, the category itself is the site of tremendous contestation and confrontation. Who speaks as and for Hawaiians? This question calls for a range of possible answers, not only for the reason that Hawaii has long been ethnically diverse and has suffered a daunting colonial past (see Trask). Into the calculus of figuring ethnic identities one must account for the dynamic quality of shifting allegiances, as interest groups con- tract and expand in order to maximize political might and rhetorical punch. As with the study of religion generally, the fascinating aspect of studying such dynamic processes is precisely to see the power of mythological speech in elevating what is contingent and historical to the status of cul- tural truth.</page><page sequence="14">340 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the ancestors and the land are the true Hawaiians; the ancestors and the land, in turn, will care for the true Hawaiians. Obviously this is circular- but rather than a primitive logical mistake, it is representative of much religious language that seeks to depict and authorize social boundaries. The very circularity of the position is not a weakness; it is strength, her- metically sealing the position from external challenges. Here, then, even ethnicity-Hawaiianness itself-becomes demonstrable through religious appeals that are effectively immune from challenge. Finally, Mr. Nihipali's prayer makes an explicit political turn. In staccato fashion, he evokes apocalyptic images of an unmistakably revolutionary hue: "For that which is above shall be brought down. For that which is below shall be lifted up. Our islands will again be united." The last Hawaiian representative with whom we are concerned is Edward Halealoha Ayau. Building on his testimony introduced earlier, he added substance to a central metaphor of the Hawaiians: this dispute is a battle, and the ki'i is a warrior. Specifically, Mr. Ayau described how the object is a Ku-style figure: "The ki'i was carved in what is called the KiC style. KCi is a war god. KCi in Hawaiian also means 'upright.' It means 'to stand.' That's what this ki'i was-was used for. It was used in a KCi tra- dition, which is warfare" (NAGPRA Review Committee 1996: 48-49). This identification of the object with the god Ku leads us into the riches of ancient Hawaiian tradition. It also confronts us with our central question: Is this a traditional use of tradition? CONCLUSION: STRANGER KINGS HAVE HAPPENED To venture a contextualized answer to the question just posed, we need to look into the conceptual load the Hawaiians took on by referring to the image as a K: figure. To be sure, when Mr. Ayau invoked the name of Ku he was doing so in congruence with preceding Hawaiian claims that the object was used in warfare by leading chiefs, for Kf: is widely under- stood to have been the primary deity in charge of warfare (Cox and Dav- enport; Kanahele; Malo; Valeri). Furthermore, two important points offer support for the association with Kf. First, sources agree that Ki was the deity pertaining to craftsmen and in particular to the carving of images (Buck: 465; Malo: 82). Second, evidence suggests that Ki was thought by some Hawaiians to imbue warriors and chiefs with the capacity to wield their spears expertly in battle (Young: 78). These observations notwithstanding, two foundational aspects of Hawaiian tradition make the appeal to Kf look spurious. First, even if we grant that the object is an 'aumakua figure, a serious categorical dis- crepancy must be addressed. Namely, precontact Hawaiian religion rec-</page><page sequence="15">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 341 ognized two kinds of deities, akua and 'aumakua (Cox and Davenport; Valeri). The former were understood to be primary deities, and the lat- ter, minor spirits. Akua were the basis of the kapu system and were understood to be responsible for all major issues of social and cosmic existence. The latter are most often described as familial spirits (often malevolent and used in sorcery) and were believed also to be manifest in various natural phenomena (Valeri: 23-29). Not only was Kf one of the four akua, but in another manifestation he was the paramount deity of the Hawaiian cosmos (Valeri: 13). Thus, in a system that distinguished between major and minor deities, Kf stood at the furthest remove from the seemingly trivial 'aumakua. In this way, for Hawaiians in the present to call Kfi into an 'aumakua vessel would seem to violate the very order of their own tradition. The second problem with the invocation of Kf is related to the fore- going. The Hawaiian activists represented themselves as the kanaka (the people) and routinely made reference to the aina (land) and their tenure upon it as the quite literal ground of their authority. This is as we might expect it, given the political nature of the Hawaiians' grievances and the explicit ways in which they linked the return of the object with their projects of regaining sovereignty. But given this context, it seems awk- ward for the Hawaiians to invoke Kf as their champion. Like much of Polynesia, Hawaii (at least in the time surrounding European contact) was a realm ruled largely by stranger kings (Sahlins 1992). The kanaka were regularly enfeudalized by foreign chiefs who took their position by way of conquest and who maintained their rule through a combination of forced tribute, human sacrifice, and divine homologization (Sahlins 1992: 22). By way of mythology and quotidian idiom, the kanaka distinguished between the "original" chiefs (and gods) who ruled from the land (indig- enously) and stranger kings. At the time of European contact the Hawaiian religious system reflected this tension through the celebration of opposed but complementary deities. Most importantly, Lono was represented by the priests and was held to be in charge of reproduction and peace, whereas Ku was embodied by the foreign chiefs and was regarded as the god of warfare and destruction. Thus, Kf was politically and cosmologically con- figured a stranger-and a fairly harsh one at that. Most pointedly, he rep- resented the control of the kanaka by foreign power. So it seems a strange and incongruent choice to appeal to Ki as champion of the people in the present. Or is it? Both of the problems I have raised are cast in a new light if we con- sider the breakdown of traditional Hawaiian religion in 1819 with the end of Kamehameha's reign and the end of the kapu system. The kapu system was among other things a collective representation of anticollective in-</page><page sequence="16">342 Journal of the American Academy of Religion terests. It was a mechanism by which things were "tabooed," which in practice meant a system of distinctions separating the spheres of the nobility and the kanaka, as well as the roles of men and women. Mat- ters changed significantly when traditional religion was abandoned after Kamehameha's death in a time of cultural and economic upheaval. At this time worship of the primary deities (akua) effectively ended. At the same time traditional systems of kanaka enfeudalism were breaking down as the chiefs became entrenched in European trade and consumption pat- terns as the primary means to accumulate and display mana (Merry: 45; Sahlins 1985, 1992). Of decisive relevance to our inquiry, the 'aumakua system was not abandoned in 1819. While many of the cultural elite adopted various Christianities, many of the kanaka continued to worship familial spirits and other 'aumakua. In fact, 'aumakua worship appears to have subsumed elements of akua worship and the traditional temple religion. As Valeri argues, "It is likely that since the cult of 'aumakua survived the abolition of the traditional, official religion, this notion was used increasingly to describe the deities of the past and their natural manifestations even when they did not traditionally belong to the 'aumakua class" (29; also see Kanahele: 81). Thus, as the people were no longer directly subordi- nate to chiefs, so too the 'aumakua were not subordinate to the akua. Rather, the relationship in both cases is one of incorporation of the for- merly superior by the formerly inferior in the face of a new foreign threat (European commerce and Christianity). In this context, then, some of the apparent tensions in contemporary Hawaiians' appropriation of Ku begin to dissolve. Traditional religion reappears, as it were, through a camera obscura of sorts. Images of Ku the warrior are domesticated by the people in order to fight with and for them against a new stranger king: the Haole. Indeed, this sort of appeal to a domesticated and defensive K: has recent precedent in the 1986 work of George Kanahele, interestingly titled KCi Kanaka. Kanahele argues that contemporary emphasis should be placed on Ku's bravery and the ex- ample he sets for his people in "standing tall" for the land (91). More- over, attentive visitors to Hawaii today will notice the prevalence of fierce Ku images in street and surf settings, attesting to his attractiveness to those who find themselves at odds with an increasingly non-Hawaiian society. Linking past and present understandings of Ku, I do not view contempo- rary appropriations of Kf as a kind of spurious tradition; rather, I interpret these appeals, to borrow a phrase from Marshall Sahlins, as a contempo- rary expression of a "structure of the longue duree: the paradigmatic opposition between the original king of sacred descent and legitimate succession on one side, and on the other the violent stranger and usurper</page><page sequence="17">Johnson: Ancestors before Us 343 who seizes power through the sacrifice of his predecessor and maintains it by offerings of the corpses of his adversaries" (1992: 22). Having invoked Sahlins, one might ask if I understand the Hawai- ian representatives' appeal to Ku as simply the playing out of Polynesian structures in the drama of the present. This would be to underappreciate Sahlins's historical anthropology, for he allows that agents act, even if not always according to the cultural script (1985, 1995). I would add that people may well be guided by cultural categories but are not everywhere ruled by them. Situations are confronted, assessments are made, and stra- tegic actions are taken in all human enterprises. The choice to invoke K:, I am arguing, was surely motivated by present concerns (see Lincoln on this theme). But being so, it is not thereby necessarily spurious (see Han- dler and Linnekin; Linnekin 1991). As Peter Nabokov has recently writ- ten, "Uncovering the synthesized nature of indigenous claims does not mean that they are composed of thin air. Study of their components and adhesive compounds identifies cultural processes that can also be up- streamed to identify their presence and consistency over earlier eras" (234). In a modest and provisional way, this is effectively what I have at- tempted to demonstrate here. My goal has been to provide an example, drawn from one culture but constituted in different historical periods, that shows how religious discourse is always at work and constantly worked on. My point has been to suggest that if we distinguish between pure tra- dition and political invention this is tantamount to marking off the past and discounting the present-both acts ignore the profoundly human and social quality of tradition. As I see it, our task is to chart the ways reli- gious systems perform their political and ethnic work, even when those are configured by ruptures, erasures, and occasional inversions.
