When he dies in 1800, however, after having spent many autodidactic and peripa- tetic years in and around the Berlin late Enlightenment and its after-ech- oes, he has become something rather different, a German-Jewish secular intellectual. According to Kant's own testimony, Maimon is one of the most perspicaciously critical early readers of the Critique of Reason. And today historians of idealism generally acknowledge that his philosophi- cal works take a crucial step on the path of thought from Kant to Fichte.3 In addition, he is a significant contributor to Karl Philipp Moritz's path- breaking journal on empirical psychology, the Magazin zur Erfahrungs- seelenkunde, as well as the author of one of the most important Jewish autobiographies of the period.4 In short, despite and/or because of the fact that he is finally a complete outsider everywhere he goes, Maimon becomes one of the most influential amongst Jewish participants - or even participants in general - in the philosophical and literary dis- courses in the German language at the end of the eighteenth century. In the following, I discuss Maimon's Autobiography in order to show how issues of cultural identity take shape in his life and work, and to determine what Maimon has to tell us - which is, I think, ultimately strikingly advanced, and not merely a matter of antiquarian interest - about such issues across the two centuries that separates his turn of the century from our own. I consider Maimon to be - perhaps even more than Mendelssohn - an "exemplary" case of Jewish-German dialogue in the modem period, and this for the very reason that Maimon - like such dialogue itself - is radically incapable of finding a stable place within either the Jewish or the German communities, although he is, in 3. For Maimon's influence on Fichte, centered on the principle of the identity of the finite and infinite understanding, see for example Samuel Atlas, From Critical to Specula- tive Idealism: the Philosophy of Solomon Maimon (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1964) 316-30; Achim Engstler, Untersuchungen zum Idealismus Salomon Maimons 243-60 et passim, but especially 256-59, where Engstler suggestively emphasizes the difference between Maifion and Fichte in terms of method, despite their strong commonalities on the level of content. On Maimon as a reader of Kant, see Frederick C. Beiser, The Fate ofRea- son: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1987) 285-323. 4. Liliane Weissberg has usefully illuminated Maimon's career by focusing on the context and implications of Maimon's collaboration with Moritz in "Erfahrungsseelen- kunde als Akkulturation: Philosophie, Wissenschaft, und Lebensgeschichte bei Salomon Maimon," in Hans JUirgen Schnip, ed., Der ganze Mensch: Anthropologie und Literatur- wissenschaft im achtzehnten Jahrhundert (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1994) 298-328.</page><page sequence="3">38 Stolen Goods his maturity, thoroughly well-versed in both traditions and although he tries so hard to mediate between the two. Indeed, my contention is that it is precisely on the basis of his position as radical social outsider (despite his formidable achievements on the level of his writings), and his experience as someone who always finds himself doing and saying the inappropriate thing, a position which is conditioned by the specifi- cally post-Counterenlightenment moment he problematically inhabits, that Maimon is able to generate an important account of cultural iden- tity as constituted always by inappropriate appropriation, the taking of what is not one's own, or theft. Further, I argue that this account can provide us with a useful theoretical orientation in our situation today because of the analogy that can be drawn between our own historical- theoretical conjuncture and that of the intellectuals in Berlin from the late 1780s through the late 1790s, to which I will return below. In order to proceed toward the presentation of Maimon's account of cultural identity as theft, I will begin by considering briefly the problem of cul- tural identity as it presents itself to us today, and then situate Maimon within the two main tensions - the cultural tension between Jews and Christians and the discursive tension between Enlightenment and Coun- terenlightenment - that he inherits, before considering his response to these tensions in the Autobiography. Cultural Particularism and Humanist Universalism Since the late 1980s, the question of cultural identity has dominated - and continues to dominate - more advanced work in the humani- ties and social sciences, which has taken place under the broad rubric of cultural studies.5 Indeed, the question of cultural identity has been able to function in such a productive manner at the center of these fields that it has tended to absorb both other important social categories of critical thought, such as race, gender, and class, and the apparently less materi- alist categories that comprise formalist poetics and hermeneutics.

Librett 39 these categories tend today to be approached as so many instances of cultural identity (or at least to be tracked down in terms of their cultur- ally constructed components or dimensions). Why is this the case? While the various overdeterminations of this self-propagation of dis- courses around cultural identity are too complex to be analyzed here in detail, one of the more important ones, and one that is immanent to the conceptual foundations of these discourses, is the fact that the relative pri- orities of, on the one hand, particular culture, and, on the other hand, the universal traits and values of humanity, are so maddeningly difficult to establish.6 If the analysis of humanity in universal, theoretical terms tends both to efface the concrete specificity of particular cultures and also always (at least implicitly) to speak in the name of a particular culture (e.g., as theory that is "French," or "German," or "Anglo-american," or "white," or "male," or "straight," or more broadly as "Western"), then it evidently becomes desirable to avoid or mitigate the violence of these self-blinding limitations of theoreticism by pursuing more concrete histor- ical studies of particular cultures and cultural particulars. Instead of the "melting pot" of theory, and since the waning of the fashionability of philosophical deconstruction beginning in the late 1980's, advanced work in the human sciences has rightly therefore tended to prioritize "multicul- turalism" from a variety of (new or old) historicist perspectives. Clearly, however, there are two ways in which such a shift in the thematic focus of teaching and research has sometimes erred from its intended path. First, description can become affirmation - read: implicit universaliza- tion, or establishment of the particular and relative as a general and abso- lute model or criterion for humanity. Thus, a new self-absorbed particularism - a legitimation of prejudice worthy of Gadamer although generally not explicitly identified with his hermeneutics - threatens to replace the old, pseudo-universalist particularism of the "traditional canon," but with two noteworthy differences. On the one hand, the new particularism is a particularism of those minority cultures which were for- merly repressed; it genuinely corrects for former misplacements of emphasis in the historiography of culture(s) and its risks are therefore worth taking. On the other hand, the particularism of cultural studies, 6. One might name as factors in the rise of cultural studies, without making any attempt to hierarchize or be complete: the limited progress of civil rights in America, the long reign of conservatism in America starting in 1980 at least, the increasing globaliza- tion of capital, the rise of nationalism in eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet Union, and on the level of theory the exhaustion of (post)structuralism.</page><page sequence="5">40 Stolen Goods being based on the critique of false universality in Western humanism(s), is almost always aware that the erection of the particular as a universal model is an instance of regression into cultural-political violence. That is, cultural studies does not inevitably repeat in inverted form the provincial, ahistorical, and/or cultural imperialist shortcomings of the preceding theo- reticism (from the new criticism through the heyday of Yale deconstruc- tion), at least not without reflecting on the fact that it is doing so. The second way in which the evasion of pseudo-universalism can fail in cultural-identity-political work is that, as Ernesto Laclau has pointed out, in order to justify one's emphasis on "minority" or "subaltern" dis- courses, one is sometimes forced to invoke the values of the "universal- ist" discourses one has criticized. Here, too, cultural particularism and universalist humanism are at once mutually dependent and at odds. Criti- cal cultural studies, then, both opposes false universalism and knows that it cannot do without some form of universality, some generalized human- ism or anthropology of its own. As a project with progressive intent, it is driven by the apparently unsublatable dialectical instability of the rela- tionship between particular culture and universal humanity. The question of how the individual is to be situated between the poles of particular and universal, relative and absolute cultures, local color and humanity, seems to be an inexhaustibly troubling and discourse-productive one. Jewish/Christian and Rational/Irrational Polarities in Late Eighteenth-Century German Discourse Assuming that this is a legitimate - if excessively condensed sketch of the obsessions that most readers will bring today to the topic of the eighteenth-century cultural history of Germany, then one of the more pressing questions with respect to that history is the following: how are problems of cultural identity being managed in this period and in this place, and how does the eighteenth-century version of these issues shed light on our own historical-theoretical conjuncture and the dialectics of the particular and the universal around which the studies of "culture" in our own moment turn? For example, how might we trans- late the terms of the debates we find in that period into the analogous debates we find in our own? And having done this, what insights can we absorb about the structure and significance of cultural identity? 7.

Librett 41 In the case of the late eighteenth-century cultural tension between (Christian) Germans and Jews - where particular cultural identity is just beginning to be disentangled from the question of the positive-reli- gious community to which one belongs, i.e., from the question of which version of revelation one adheres to - the situation can be sketched as follows. As is well known (although still much debated by historians in terms of causes, consequences, and significance), one of the more strik- ing developments in eighteenth-century German cultural history is the sudden and surprising rapprochement between a certain number of Ger- mans - i.e., German Christians - and Jews in the upper echelons of Berlin society during the last few decades of that century. The opening of the possibility of the civil "emancipation" of Jews in German princi- palities - a possibility that was not "realized" until the Jews in all of Germany were granted full citizenship in 1871 under Bismarck (a "real- ization" lasting only 62 years until 1933) - was signalled on the "pub- lic" stage by the Prussian War Councillor Christian Wilhelm Dohm's text "On the Civil Improvement of the Jews" (1781) as well as by the Austrian Emperor Joseph II's Edicts of Toleration at about the same time. On a more "private" stage, or on a social rather than a political one, the possibility of the "emancipation" of Jews appeared at this time in the form of the development of Salon culture, in which fashionably self-cultivating Jews and Gentiles intermingled in the homes of not only well-to-do Christian women but also - and above all - women from the leading Jewish families of Berlin. On the level of philosophy, literature, and literary criticism, which mediate between the "public" and the "private," this new openness of Germans and Jews toward one another appears in the German and Hebrew Enlightenments.8 In the 8.

E. Less- ing (especially in his plays, The Jews [1754] and Nathan the Wise [1779]) preach tolerance of the Jews, and Jews literate in German such as Moses Mendelssohn, Markus Herz, and Lazarus Bendavid enter the arenas of secular philosophy, aesthetics, theology, literary criticism, medicine, etc. In the Hebrew Enlightenment, or Haskalah, Moses Men- delssohn is also active, along with people from eastern and western Europe like Hartwig Wessely, Salomon Dubno, Aron Jaroslaw, etc., who attempt to introduce modem rationality into Hebrew-language Jewish culture in various ways. But the new apparent openness of the German culture toward the Jews living in its midst is not only ambivalent (as we'll see in a moment) even at its highpoint, but extremely short-lived.9 Even before the French Rev- olution, the rapprochement between Christians and Jews in German-lan- guage culture is undone - in principle, if not already in practice - by the rise, in the 1780s, of the Counterenlightenment. More particularly, in 1785, F.H. Jacobi (to the applause of his friends and supporters, such as J.C. Lavater and J.G. Hamann) attacks the Enlightenment, as repre- sented by the works of the recently deceased Lessing and in the person of Mendelssohn.10 Addressing his attack to Mendelssohn in On the Doc- trine of Spinoza, in Letters to Herr Moses Mendelssohn, Jacobi charac- terizes Enlightenment Reason as essentially Spinozist - which means here explicitly not only atheist and materialist but Jewish and therefore inhuman. This attack already rings the death-knell of the Enlightenment mode of openness to the Jews exemplified by Lessing and his closest 9. And in turn, Jewish orthodoxy in Berlin and elsewhere resists the "rationaliza- tion" of Jewish culture. 10. In my use of the term, "Counterenlightenment," I am not referring to the more theopolitically complicated and relatively nuanced positions of figures like Herder, Lenz and the early Goethe and Schiller, but above all to Jacobi, Lavater, Hamann, and those closest to them. For an analysis that touches on some of the connections between Maimon and Goethe and Schiller, while placing Maimon socially and ideologically between the Enlightenment and Romantic discourses, see Dagmar Barnouw, "Enlightenment, Identity, Transformation: Salomon Maimon and Rahel Varnhagen," in Klaus Berghahn, ed., The German-Jewish Dialogue Reconsidered: a Symposium in Honor of George L.

Librett 43 associates."l Whereas the Enlightenment had argued (tendentially) that the cultural particularity of the positive religions could be reconciled with - and this ultimately meant "translated into" or "reduced to" - universally human experience as determined by a rational anthropology within the framework of rational natural theology, the Counterenlighten- ment now claims - through a gesture Richard Wagner will repeat sixty- five years later in "Judaism in Music" - that this very argument is a Jewish argument. That is, according to its most vehement opponents, the Enlightenment represents not only one particular culture, but the "Jew- ish" culture which, itself nonhuman, wants to usurp the place of the human, having cut itself off from humanity by refusing Christ. Now, in a surprising way, I would argue, the Counterenlighteners are not completely mistaken in their feeling that there is something vaguely "Jewish" about the Enlightenment, although of course they are deeply wrong about the nonhuman character of the Jews and in their specific account of the actual basis of their feeling. For if the Enlightenment is, of course, not in any literal sense a Jewish phenomenon, it does tend - in Lessing, and even Kant - to turn to the - in a Lutheran context, always "Jewish" - law (of ethical works) as to the supplement needed by Luth- eran inwardness in order to give that inwardness some nondogmatic for- mal shape and some way of guiding its expressions in the world of action.12 That is, the reason why Lutheranism turns to the (Jewish) law is to avoid its immanent tendency - the tendency of all institutions - to become dogmatically narrow-minded, particularistic, and so no longer truly "spiritual." In Lessing's polemic against the orthodox Lutheran Pas- tor Goeze, more specifically, it is Goeze's "Jewish" fixation on the letter (of Protestant dogma) that prompts Lessing to privilege ethical practice over dogmatic faith, in a gesture that achieves its canonical formulation in the Ring-Parable of Nathan the Wise.13 Practice, however, is law-gov- erned production of works, and there is no way for orthodox Lutheran- ism - the culture of sola fide - to understand the law of works except 11.

Hence, Lutheranism turns to welcome the ("Jew- ish") law as its supplement in order not to become entirely "Jewish" (i.e., fixated on the dead letter). (This is the ambivalence of the Enlighten- ment toward the Jews which I referred to above.) Further, because at this point in the development of Lutheranism (i.e., in the self-critique or self- exacerbation of Lutheranism that is the German Enlightenment) the law of works is what the Protestant spirit thinks it needs, there is a tendency for this spirit to situate its essence in that law itself, just as - in a Freud- ian register - the object of desire always tends to become an ego-ideal: one can never completely avoid confusing what one wants to have with what one essentially is. Moreover, since on a more general level the Enlightenment does articulate a pseudo-universal, ahistorical humanity that is nonetheless reducible to a culturally-historically specific concre- tion (or a false concrete universal), and since the discourse of false con- crete universality is called "Jewish" from the standpoint of that other positive-religious false concrete universality that calls itself "Christian- ity," the Enlightenment is indeed "Jewish" from the perspective of Prot- estant irrationalism. Thus, when the Counterenlighteners attack the Enlightenment for being "Jewish," they are not completely wrong, although they are not at all aware of the sense in which they are right. What, then, do the Counterenlighteners put in the place of the "Jewish" Enlightenment principle of the reconcilability of cultural particularity with universal humanity on the level of ethical action? Irrationalist ideologues like Lavater, Hamann, and Jacobi suppose quite simply that only some cultures embody the universal, while others do not. In Jacobi's view, more specifically, only the culture of the Christian revelation, i.e., the faithful submission of the will to this revelation, can provide access to the univer- sally human experience. Only the becoming-man of God enables its mir- ror image, the becoming-God of man (or the becoming-one-with-God of man), as the becoming-universal of the particular, to take place. After Jacobi's attack on Mendelssohn and Lessing, then, not only has the Enlightenment version of the possibility of Jewish-Christian reconciliation in Germany become unsettled by Jacobi's call to resist the "Judaization" of German-Protestant spirit, but at the same time implicitly the more gen- eral possibility of reconciling cultural-national diversity with the project of the constitution of one humanity. Where, then, does the next generation turn, the one represented for example by Moses Mendelssohn's daughter, Dorothea, and her second husband, Friedrich Schlegel?</page><page sequence="10">Jeffrey S. Librett 45 In the early years of the nineteenth century the early German Roman- tics (the Schlegels, Novalis, Tieck, etc.) will reject the exaggerated irra- tionalism of the Sturm und Drang, but they will likewise fail to articulate a philosophical anthropology that either genuinely allows for, or is capable of sublating, cultural multiplicity. Instead of trying to artic- ulate a universal humanity that would provide the essence of all appear- ances of cultural particularity, as does the Enlightenment, and instead of simply rejecting the Jewish "letter" of Enlightenment universality out of hand, as the programmatic Sturm und Drang tries to do, Romantic dis- course will attempt, in new ways, as I have argued elsewhere, to synthe- size the Lutheran Protestant spirit with the Jewish letter.14 The two solutions it proposes will be the aesthetic solution of the early phase of the Romantic movement (the period of the publication of the journal Athenium by the Schlegel brothers and their friends around 1800) and then the Catholicizing solution of the later phase (which, for Friedrich and Dorothea Schlegel, is marked by their conversion in 1808, although in Novalis, of course, the Neo-Catholic turn occurs much earlier). In neither case, however, will the Romantics go beyond the need to situate humanity in a limited concretization, a particular cultural group. In the case of the aestheticist moment of early Romanticism, which always involves the elitist emphasis on the insider-group of the artist-philoso- phers, the universality of humanity in the emphatic sense is embodied exclusively by the community of those who participate in aesthetic- philosophical production. And when the Neo-Catholic turn arrives, the universality of humanity will be anchored in the one true Church. Finally, in a development that tends to revitalize and to confirm the Counterenlightenment tendencies within the Romantic movement, begin- ning with the French occupation of German territories, modem German nationalism takes on increasingly a counterrevolutionary, reactionary, and intolerant "spirit." The Salon culture in Berlin quickly wanes (beginning with the occupation of Berlin in 1806), intermarriages sub- side, and conversion remains - against the hopes of those who favored Jewish civil emancipation - a prerequisite for participation in many of the male professions. The seeds of late nineteenth-century racial anti- Semitism begin to be sown already during the Idealist and Romantic 14. Jeffrey S.

In the Wake of the Counterenlightenment: Salomon Maimon's Jewish-Christian "Dialogue" Where is Salomon Maimon's place within this development? Let us begin by situating him in the chronology of generations. Born in 1753, Maimon is twenty-four years younger than Lessing and Mendelssohn (both born in 1729), twenty-nine years younger than Kant, ten years younger than Jacobi, nine years younger than Herder, twelve years younger than Lavater, four years younger than Goethe, six years older than Schiller, ten years older than Dorothea Schlegel, and nineteen years older than Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis (both born in 1772). In short, he is born between the Enlightenment and Romantic generations, in the generation or half-generation occupied roughly by the proponents of Sturm und Drang and Weimar Neoclassicism, is younger than the main ideologues of Sturm und Drang, and is between the ages of Goethe and Schiller. Thus, in terms of age, Maimon is not to be situated within the Enlightenment, as he often is, but within the age of Neoclassicism (although outside of the Greco-Roman particularism of the latter). His Autobiography, from 1792, appears almost a decade after Jacobi's attack on the Enlightenment, and his significant philosophical works stem from the very late 1780s and 1790s. Maimon's mere position in time suggests therefore that his works may well be attempting to make sense out of the tension between the Enlightenment and the Counterenlightenment, as were indeed the Weimar Neoclassicists in a very different way.16 Before taking a detailed look at how Maimon's thought reflects this immediately post-Counterenlightenment position in period terms, how- ever, a word is perhaps necessary to explicitate the analogy, to which I have alluded above, between this position and our own. The point is simply this: the Counterenlightenment responds to the false (or the 15. Leon Poliakov, The History of Anti-semitism, vol. III, trans.

Librett 47 exaggerated) claims of the rationalist (and especially Leibniz-Wolffian) Enlightenment to have attained an ahistorical universal definition of the human. It attempts to correct the errors of its predecessors by means of a radical historicism, basing its value-judgments on the givens of a par- ticular culture of revelation, a particular culture as revelation. The simi- larity between this Counterenlightenment and the period of cultural studies from the new historicism through postcolonial studies is there- fore, on one level, very close: cultural studies too is based on the cri- tique of theoreticism (here, those of formalism, structuralism, and poststructuralism, even in some cases of Marxism when it is viewed as a culturally-historically situated theoretical formation) as a false univer- sality that is blind to its own historical and cultural specificity. The rad- ical contrast between the Counterenlightenment and cultural studies, of course, consists in this: cultural studies are of progressive intent, whereas the Counterenlightenment I am considering here is for the most part manifestly regressive in intent. The explicit desire behind work in cultural studies tends to be one of emancipation from opaque and arbi- trary authority, while the desire of the Counterenlightenment was for a return to the authority of a dominant tradition. Still, in the wake of the Counterenlightenment critique of the Enlightenment, just as in the wake of the cultural studies critique of (post)structuralism and other formal- isms and theoreticisms (a critique which, after all, has in a certain sense already been fully stated), one is faced with the need to reconcile, in some sense, the necessity of universality, the necessity of positing human criteria valid for all cultures, with the necessity of particularity, or the necessary lack of any possible metacultural and metahistorical language in which to articulate such a truly universal humanism. Hav- ing sketched this analogy between Maimon's own theoretical-historical conjuncture and our own, we can now turn back to consider his spe- cific response to his own situation. How does Maimon's attitude with respect to the religiocultural identi- ties of Jewish and Christian and with respect to the major motifs of Enlightenment and Counterenlightenment metaphysics demonstrate that he is struggling to find some kind of reconciliation between the Enlight- enment and Counterenlightenment legacies? In general, on the one hand, Maimon tries like an Enlightener to reconcile cultural particularism with humanistic universalism by seeking the universalistic core of particular cultures. On the other hand, in line with the Counterenlightenment insight into the historicity of all human phenomena, yet without the typically</page><page sequence="13">48 Stolen Goods Counterenlightenment belief in one culture as adequate historical embodiment of the absolute, Maimon always shifts, at a loss for an absolute point of view, from one particular (positive-religious) culture to another and back again, depending on the situation, in his search for a vocabulary capable of directly expressing the universally human. 17 More specifically with respect to the Jewish-Christian polarity, when Maimon attempts to appropriate Judaism in a critical manner, to find that in it with which he can identify, he tends to read it from a tradition- ally Christian point of view as a mere particularistic prefiguration of a universal, literally spiritual language. (Sometimes, in this endeavor, he adopts a more rationalist Christian idiom, and sometimes a more empir- icist and/or irrationalist one.) Accordingly, Maimon sometimes criti- cizes Mendelssohn as a kind of residually particularist Jew who is incapable of taking sufficient distance from his traditional Judaism. In these ways, Maimon draws on Christianity, as if it were a universally human discourse, to criticize Enlightenment Judaism. He cannot remain a traditionally observant Jew, as Mendelssohn could, who articulated in Jerusalem, or on Religious Power and Judaism (1783) his vision of the reconciliation between orthodox Jewish particularism (the culture of the revealed law) and universal reason (the culture of eternal truths). On the other hand, however, when Maimon attempts to appropriate Christianity, when he attempts to identify with it as an institutional and social-historical presence, he in turn reads it as a particularism, and now sees Judaism as being more compatible with universalistic reason than Christianity. In this context, Maimon draws on Enlightenment argu- ments - indeed, on arguments explicitly advanced by Mendelssohn himself - to criticize Christianity as excessively irrationalistic. He can- not therefore bring himself to convert, as will for example almost all of Mendelssohn's children. Thus, Maimon plays off against each other both the Enlightenment and the Counterenlightenment and also Judaism and Christianity, making each term in each opposition at one time or another play particularity to the universality of the other term. This absolutely ambivalent position is of course radically untenable: 17.

He remains in all situations Quixotic, which is why the echoes of picaresque in his Autobiography are so appropriate. But it is precisely because Maimon fits in nowhere that he stands here, in my argument, for the exemplary representative of Jewish-German "dialogue": this "dialogue" never allowed, as Scholem points out, for any reconciliation that was not reconciliation under duress. Let us look in greater detail at Maimon's insightful - and yet apparently often baffled and helpless - uncertainty as it appears in his Autobiography, before turning to the passages in that work in which the model for cultural appropriation as theft emerges that provides at once an ironic account of Maimon's exemplary cultural confusion and a tragicomic synthesis of the Enlight- enment and Counterenlightenment positions. Between Judaic Anthropomorphism, Christian Allegory, and the Pagan Promise of Natural Religion In line with the Pauline notion of Judaism as a particularistic (pre)fig- uration of the universality that is realized in Christianity, Maimon's rejection of traditional Judaism, first of all, is based on what he takes to be its (pre)figural, particularist character.18 Again and again, his point is that although Judaism does have a kind of access to truth, this access is only figural. For example, while staying with a Jewish family in Grafenhage, Holland, Maimon not only doubts stories of wonder-work- ing Kabbalists, attempting to reduce apparently miraculous phenomena to the working of "natural laws" (176) - as did Nathan in the begin- ning of Lessing's drama, Nathan the Wise - but he goes on to outrage his hosts by refusing for philosophical reasons to pronounce the bless- ing over the wine, even though he is a trained Rabbi: It was only love of truth, I declared, and reluctance to be guilty of inconsistency, that made it impossible for me, without manifest aver- sion, to say prayers which I regarded as a result of an anthropomor- phic system of theology. (176) The "anthropomorphic" character of Judaism prompts Maimon here, after his encounter with the secularized Christian forms of modem "rea- son" in Berlin, to reject Judaism. 18. On this prefiguration-fulfillment model, whose importance is always underesti- mated because it is so familiar, see Erich Auerbach, "Figura," Scenes from the Drama of European Literature, trans. Paolo Valesio (Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1984) 11-78.</page><page sequence="15">50 Stolen Goods But it is not only the relatively late influence of the Berlin Enlighten- ment that causes Maimon to see Judaism as inadequate because a mere figuration of the universally human. Maimon's initial rejection of tradi- tional Judaism, prior to his voyage from Poland to Germany, occurs in almost exactly the same terms. For example, in retelling the story of his early studies of Kabbalah, Maimon says that even then the Kabbalah appeared to him as having been: originally ... probably nothing other than psychology, physics, morals, politics, and such, represented by symbols and hieroglyphs in fables and allegories, whose secret sense one revealed only to those who were quali- fied [tiichtig]. By and by, through various revolutions, this secret sense was lost, the signs were taken for the things signified themselves. (76-7G) The Kabbalah is the figurative expression of a literal truth which has gradually come to be forgotten, replaced by the figures themselves. And despite his early attempts to proceed from the figurative expression of the Kabbalah to the literal truths of rational science, attempts which go so far as to imagine that the ten categories of Aristotle are the literal truth of the ten sephirot, Maimon finally gives up in exasperation: But still this could not satisfy me. I wished to see the sciences in their natural light, not wrapped up in fables. I had indeed already learned to read German, even if imperfectly: but where was I supposed to get German books in Lithuania? (85G) The transitions both from Judaism to the Christian-secular world and also from the imperfect, prescientific languages of Hebrew and Yiddish to the scientific language of German are figured here as the passage from the figurative to the literal and so from the particular to the universal. But things are not so simple. It is not merely or always a spirituality of specifically Christian provenience (even if now secularized) that supplies for Maimon the universal truth of the Jewish particularistic prefiguration. For Maimon, just as in the case of Kabbalah the figural originates in the literal "secret sense," which only subsequently falls into forgetfulness, and just as Yiddish is a fallen form of German, in principle capable of returning to its original "purity," so the Jewish religion has experienced a moment when its form was reconciled with a rational content. Judaism can therefore have some basis for the aspiration to pass from its current, purely figural and particular status to the literality and universality which this figurality once embodied. In other words, if Maimon sometimes</page><page sequence="16">Jeffrey S. Librett 51 appropriates Judaism by translating it into, or positing it as realized in, an antifigural spirituality that is of apparently Christian origin, at other times he appropriates Judaism by translating it into a part that represents the whole of itself from within: this part (or synecdoche) is the medieval rationalism of Moses Maimonides, the thinker whose name Maimon chooses for himself in his adulthood. Maimonides, the medieval neo- Aristotelian Jewish philosopher, is exemplary for Maimon in particular because of his achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed: "the restora- tion of the harmony between religious belief and rational knowledge" (247). Not surprisingly, Maimon tells us that this restoration took the form of the translation of figural into literal knowledge, the determina- tion of the limits of figures and of the proper mode of their rationalizing transformation into literal truth. Maimonides was able to present: the importance of a correct interpretation of the fables, allegories, and all improper expressions for a correct knowledge of the holy scriptures. (253)19 The existence of this precedent for the inner-Judaic literalization and uni- versalization of Judaic figural particularity makes clear that, although Maimon does participate in the Christian discourse according to which Judaism is mere prefiguration, he does not participate merely or uncriti- cally in this discourse. There exist both a proper and an improper Juda- ism, a universal and a particular one, and - contrary to Christian tradition - the proper, universal one is not necessarily called "Christianity." In turn, however, there is no way of appropriating Judaism as a whole without reducing it, if not to an obviously extra-Judaic particularism that claims to be universal (Christianity), at least to an internal one (medieval rationalism), the guarantee of whose philosophical universal- ity is Aristotelian in origin, such that this "internal" rational essence of Judaism, its pagan essence, is once again a particular cultural manifesta- tion on the outside of the one to be appropriated. In this late- or post- Enlightenment context Judaism - no less and no more than any other particular culture - cannot be appropriated except by reference to other culturally particular and historically specific discourses falsely laying 19. Maimonides's restoration of the Jewish text to its immanent rationality is in fact so important to Maimon as the prefiguration of his own life's work that he devotes nearly the entire third quarter of his autobiography to a long, rather formless summary of Maimonides's works. Maimonides, whom Maimon wishes to appropriate, thus threatens to steal Maimon's text.</page><page sequence="17">52 Stolen Goods claim to universality, to the status of a literal statement of the truth from a rational human perspective. Maimon's appropriation of Judaism from the standpoints of Christian and pagan arguments and forms of "universality" is repeated, more- over, in his appropriation of the works of Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn, of course, is Maimon's principal predecessor in the role of Jewish-Ger- man philosopher, and as such, he is a prefiguration - both enabling and disabling - of Maimon himself. While Mendelssohn attempts in various ways to help Maimon get established in Berlin or elsewhere - helping arrange for Maimon to receive training in secular sciences, writ- ing him letters of recommendation, trying to set Maimon up with trans- lation and other publication projects - Maimon is suspiciously unable to establish himself either in any place or in any profession for as long as Mendelssohn is alive. In the narrative of his Autobiography, it is not until his fourth trip to Berlin, after Mendelssohn has died, that Maimon finally studies Kant's writings in a serious way - as Mendelssohn never had - and begins to make his own contribution to the history of philosophy as one of the very few most penetrating and provocative late-eighteenth century post-Kantians. Maimon comes into his own, then, by stepping into Mendelssohn's shoes, or by realizing Men- delssohn's potential. For Kant had always thought of Mendelssohn as potentially one of the best readers of his critical works, while Men- delssohn consistently disappointed that hope, remaining until his death ensconced in the Leibnizian-Wolffian framework he had initially assumed as his own, despite his continuing proto-critical attempts to find a way of synthesizing rationalism with its empirical other. Mai- mon realizes himself in philosophical discourse, then, as the (Kantian or post-Kantian) realization of Mendelssohn. As a "realization" of Mendelssohn's "prefiguration," however, Mai- mon is in a structurally Christian position vis-a-vis Mendelssohn's struc- turally Jewish one. Accordingly, in the chapter of his Autobiography devoted to Mendelssohn (158ff), Maimon both credits Mendelssohn very respectfully in all sorts of ways with having been an admirable man and a significant philosopher, and also criticizes Mendelssohn's philosophy by taking his distance from both Mendelssohn's rationalism and his residual commitment to revelation. While acknowledging the strength of Mendelssohn's philosophical achievements within the rationalist frame of reference, Maimon takes his distance from these achievements by empha- sizing in his own work, as do Jacobi and his friends, the importance of</page><page sequence="18">Jeffrey S. Librett 53 empiricist-materialist perspectives. In this way, Maimon's critique of Mendelssohn follows the irrationalist version of the Christian concretist critique of Jewish abstraction. I will consider here only the theo-politi- cal sphere, although one could make a similar argument with respect to the psychological-aesthetic sphere (169; 173 et passim) and the strictly theological domain (84-5; 155-57 et passim), as well. In the domain of political theology, at the time of the writing of the Autobiography, Maimon diverges radically from Mendelssohn's position in Jerusalem, Mendelssohn's chief work on the subject, even where he claims to be in agreement with that position. For he adopts a materialis- tic perspective on the Jewish law that is opposed to Mendelssohn's ten- dency toward a depoliticizing idealization of that law, despite the fact that he claims to support Mendelssohn's interpretation of Judaism as a revealed law rather than a revealed religion (which, as readers of Jerusa- lem will recall, was the crucial distinction Mendelssohn had drawn there between Judaism and Christianity). This difference between Maimon and Mendelssohn can be glimpsed already in Maimon's initial impulse to contest Mendelssohn's views on positive religion, according to the description of this impulse Maimon provides retrospectively in the Auto- biography. To be sure, he acknowledges that this initial, critical impulse was misguided in that it both unfairly attributed to Mendelssohn a stron- ger commitment to revealed religion than Mendelssohn had and also naively attributed to the general population a greater capacity for natu- ral religion than it possesses. Nonetheless, the position he adopts on Jerusalem in the Autobiography itself is substantially the same as the earlier one, except that Maimon now adopts that position - not insig- nificantly, as we shall see - explicitly in the name of paganism. Maimon's initial impulse was to propose his own views explicitly as a "Reformation" of Mendelssohn's (implicitly "Catholic") Judaism: since, at the time, as a novice free-thinker, I took all revealed religion to be false in itself, and its usefulness, in accordance with what I had been able to glean from the writings of Maimonides, to be merely temporal and since as a man without experience I thought it would be easy to convince others, in spite of deeply rooted habits and rigid prejudices, and presupposed the usefulness of such a Reformation [Reformation] as beyond doubt, Mendelssohn could in no way discuss these matters with me since he had to fear that I would (as has often occurred and continues to occur) claim his counterarguments to be mere sophistries and suggest that he had ulterior motives for arguing as he did. (164)</page><page sequence="19">54 Stolen Goods If, as I have suggested above, the Lutheran Reformation rebels against the "Judaism" of Catholic Christianity, then Maimon's initial desire to carry out a "Reformation" of Mendelssohn's residual commitments to revealed religion must be understood as a rebellion against the "Juda- ism" of those commitments. Further, Maimon says that this "Reforma- tion" was directed against what threatened to appear as the "sophistry" (164) of Mendelssohn's abstractly rationalist religiosity. Such "soph- istry" is implicitly quasi-"Catholic" or -"Jesuitical" in the German late- Enlightenment context because it is first of all "Jewish." Maimon indulges in a certain kind of sophistry or disingenuousness himself, however, when he goes on to say that he now agrees com- pletely with Mendelssohn's reasoning on these matters. As for me, I agree now utterly with Mendelssohn's reasoning on this matter, on the basis of my own reflections on the fundamental laws of the religion of my fathers. (164) For this "total" agreement turns out to include a fairly substantial dis- agreement. Maimon correctly points out that Mendelssohn had refused in Jerusalem to grant revealed doctrines the status of eternal truths while accepting the possibility of revealed laws. But according to Mai- mon, Mendelssohn characterizes the Jewish revealed laws as the "fun- damental laws of a theocratic constitution" (164). In Jerusalem, however, Mendelssohn precisely does not grant the notion that the Jew- ish laws are those of a mere theocracy, because he is anxious there to avoid the reduction of Judaism to a merely political nation or a poten- tially violent cultural particularism. Yet it is only this notion - which Maimon reads into Mendelssohn here - of the Jewish laws as those of a theocracy that allows Maimon to argue against Mendelssohn with apparent plausibility that it is possible for a Jew to leave behind the realm of the law simply by renouncing the rights that come with citi- zenship in the state to which those laws belong: He ... who cuts himself off from this state, does not want to be con- sidered a member of the same, and wishes to renounce all the rights of such a member (whether he has himself inscribed as a member of another state or whether he enters a condition of solitude), is even in his conscience no longer obliged to follow these laws. (164) While Maimon acknowledges with Mendelssohn that such a renuncia- tion of the state of Judaism would not be implied by a conversion to</page><page sequence="20">Jeffrey S. Librett 55 Christianity, since Jesus himself was a Jew who followed the law, he asserts against Mendelssohn (who saw no possible escape from submis- sion to the Jewish law for those born under its yoke) that it would be implied, as well as justified, by the passage to paganism, or to natural philosophy, which is itself for Maimon not a theocracy, but the private, apolitical world of eternal truths: But what if a Jew no longer wishes to be a member of this theocratic state and goes over to the heathen or philosophical religion, which is nothing more than pure natural religion? And what if he submits him- self as member of a civil state to its laws and demands his rights in turn from that state, without declaring himself at all on the question of his religion, since the state is rational enough to demand of him no such declaration (which is none of its business)? (164-65) In place of Mendelssohn's defense of Judaism - both as inescapable for all those born into it and as more compatible with rationality than either of the two Christian positive religions because it occupies the space between politics and natural religion - Maimon argues (along the lines of Spinoza's Theological-Political Tractate) that Judaism is simply a political allegiance, as easily renounced as citizenship in any other state. By replacing - the law-focused argument of Mendelssohn with what may appear to be a more purely "spiritual," or inward, emphasis on natural religion as the realm of eternal truths, Maimon moves - despite his "heathen" or "pagan" gesture here - in a Chris- tianizing direction that is fully compatible with his initial impulse to play "Reformation" to Mendelssohn's (Catholic-medieval) religiosity. Moreover, the paradoxical logic that leads to this apparently more "spiritual" position is one version of the logic of the Christian polemic against Judaism. If Judaism's error is situated in its ideality, rationalism, abstraction, and so on, then it is by means of a move in the direction of materiality that one gains the position of greater spirituality. The embodi- ment of God in Christ represents an exemplary materialization that over- comes the excessive abstractness or idealism of Jewish monotheism, an abstractness which dialectically entails in turn the excessive materiality of the letter of Jewish law. Analogously, Maimon's materialist view of the law as a purely material institution overcomes the idealization of the law in Mendelssohn, an idealization that induces Mendelssohn to retain, unbeknownst to himself, a merely political stance on the Jewish law. By taking a materialist view of the law, Maimon thinks he is able to liberate</page><page sequence="21">56 Stolen Goods himself from its national cultural particularism, and to attain the higher and more inward standpoint of the eternal truths of natural religion. The pattern of argumentation Maimon uses against Mendelssohn is there- fore quite Christian, even if the position he means to establish by means of this argumentation is that of a "pagan" natural theology. It is nonetheless not insignificant, however, that Maimon tries to speak in the name of the pagan here, and not in the name of the Christian. He is evidently aware that Christianity, despite its claims to have universalized Judaism by spiritualizing and denationalizing it, is simply one more posi- tive religion, one cultural imperialism among others. Still, while Mai- mon claims here to want to live a purely theoretical life, in the sense of a life in the "pagan" culture of natural theology, this aspiration remains naive to the degree that the idea of the "pagan" is either too abstract to comprise a way of life or it refers to particular pagan cultures, including the opaque authority and arbitrariness that all cultures entail. Thus, Maimon tries to supply Judaism with universal content by look- ing for that content either in the Christian tradition or in the pagan tradi- tions, for example that of Aristotle as it appears in Maimonides. When it becomes necessary for him to appropriate explicitly the Christian tradi- tion itself, however, as it does when he attempts, more or less for rea- sons of social expediency, to convert, Maimon situates the universality of Christianity in Judaism. He now follows strictly the argument of Men- delssohn in Jerusalem according to which Judaism is more compatible with natural religion, or rational theology, than Christianity. Let us look briefly at how this transpires, before proceeding to discuss Maimon's allegorical attempt to "theorize" the aberrations of cultural appropriation of which this encounter with Christianity will be our final example. Maimon's one attempt to convert to Christianity takes a simulta- neously pitiful and hilarious course. In the letter he writes to the Luthe- ran Pastor by whom he is asking to be converted, after having told the Pastor that the Enlightened Jewish community in Berlin has lost all interest in supporting his own studies further because of the chaotic directionlessness with which he pursues these studies, Maimon writes: I have therefore decided to take on the Christian religion, in order to attain my temporal as well as eternal bliss, which depends on reaching perfection, and in order to become useful to myself as well as to others. To be sure, the Jewish religion approaches reason more closely than the Christian religion in its articles offaith. But since the Christian religion</page><page sequence="22">Jeffrey S. Librett 57 has an advantage over the Jewish in terms of practical use, and since morality, which consists not in opinions but in deeds, is the purpose of all religions, Christianity comes closer to this purpose than Judaism. Moreover, I consider the mysteries of the Christian to be just what they are, mysteries, that is, allegorical representations of those truths that are most important to human beings, and in this way I make my belief in them harmonize with reason; I cannot possibly believe in them how- ever in accordance with their commonly accepted sense. (183) For Maimon, the mysteries of Christianity are at best mere allegorical representations of rational contents. He accordingly asks, in a rather twisted gesture (although one that takes at its word the Protestant Enlightenment), to be granted admission to the Christian fold on the basis of a confession of faith in natural theology. Moreover, following Mendelssohn's lead in Jerusalem, Maimon says that the doctrinal con- tent of Judaism as a faith is closer to the rational truth than that of Chris- tianity, failing only to specify here that the reason why the doctrinal content of Judaism is more rational than that of Christianity is that Juda- ism has no doctrinal content. Despite his admiration for Maimonides, Maimon agrees with Mendelssohn elsewhere that Maimonides's articles of faith - designed in imitation of Christian dogmatism - are essen- tially a big mistake (153). (This aspect of Maimonides's rationality seems Christian in a negative sense after all.) Yet to say that Judaism is doctrinally closer to the truth than the allegorical mysteries of Christian- ity is to suggest that Judaism is less figural and so less particularistic than Christianity. In line with this reversal, Maimon tells the Lutheran Pastor here that, even if Christianity is less true than Judaism, it is supe- rior to Judaism in terms of morality, which is a matter of practice, not theory. Thus, Maimon tells the one who believes that salvation is based on faith alone - as opposed to works, concern with which can only, according to Luther, lead to despair, as the Jewish example ostensibly teaches - that he (Maimon) wishes to belong to that man's faith because it conduces to good works! Maimon is both slapping the Pastor in the face and shooting himself in the foot: he makes it impossible for the Pastor to allow him to enter the Christian fold. In accordance with Maimon's ambivalent, borderline position, when the Pastor refuses to convert him and tells him to pray to God "that he will shine his grace upon you and fill you with the spirit of true Christianity"(184), Maimon affirmatively reasserts his Judaism. He now says that his Judaism prescribes his rationality, even though</page><page sequence="23">58 Stolen Goods when confronted with the demands of traditional Judaism, he claimed that these demands were based on an anthropomorphic and so irratio- nal and figural system: If that is the case, then I must admit, Herr Pastor, that I am not qualified to be a Christian. I will always illuminate what light I receive with the light of reason. I will never believe that I have come upon new truths if their connection with already known truths is not to be grasped. I must therefore remain what I am: a stiff-necked Jew [ein verstockter Jude]. My religion commands me to believe nothing, but rather to think the truth and to practice the good. If I am currently prevented from doing so through external circumstances, this is not my fault. I do what is in my power to do. With this, I took my leave of the Herr Pastor. (184-45) Maimon's incessantly reiterated claim to practice the kind of open- heartedness [Offenherzigkeit] in evidence here can be seen as his attempt to ingratiate himself with a largely-Christian readership by plac- ing himself in a decidedly non-"Jewish," that is, non-sophistical or non- surreptitious light. Yet it is this very (Christian) Offenherzigkeit that gets Maimon into trouble here with the Lutheran Pastor: Maimon's open heart reveals the "heartlessness" of (Jewish) reason at its core. In sum: Maimon is positioned between the concrete cultures of the Jewish and Christian worlds. He regards each, to some extent by com- parison with the other, as defined by an irrational, figural, particularis- tic discourse in need of transformation into rational literal, universality. While the "pagan" world of Aristotelian rationality and its modem ava- tar in natural theology presents itself to him as an option, this option is not a viable one in the sense of that which would provide a "living" context, i.e., an imaginary one, in Lacanian terms. Although the con- crete particularity of available cultural identities is always insuffi- ciently universal to be adequate to the individual human being (who is always a singular embodiment of absolutely abstract universality), such cultural identities are nonetheless apparently unavoidable: Maimon lapses into identification with either Jewish or Christian or pagan dis- course again and again, because no metacultural and metahistorical lan- guage is available. The question that arises at this point in the reading of Maimon, however, is this: does he in any way gain sufficient dis- tance from this situation to characterize it in general terms, i.e., to pro- vide a kind of model or general representation of cultural appropriation in its necessary impossibility?</page><page sequence="24">Jeffrey S. Librett 59 Stolen Goods: Cultural Identity as the Tragicomedy of Ubiquitous Theft My suggestion, as I will illustrate in a moment, is evidently that he does. The representation of cultural appropriation as a general phenom- enon in Maimon's Autobiography takes place above all in the various scenes of theft that punctuate the novel. Since the appropriation of cul- ture is the appropriation of what is not really one's own - assuming that in terms of Enlightenment ideals what is properly one's own is the universal essence of humanity, while culture is always specific and his- torical - and since taking what one has not been given is appropri- ately called theft, it is "proper" that Maimon represents cultural appropriation as a kind of unavoidable or irresistible theft. What is striking here, however, is not only the "conceptual content" the notion of theft - in terms of which Maimon obliquely character- izes all cultural identity-formation, but the fact that he characterizes such identity-formation obliquely. Maimon develops his model, that is, in the form of the anecdote, through a disparate collection of scenes within an autobiography, whose literary mode hovers always between fiction and reality, the figural and the literal, theory (for example, a long section of his text summarizes Maimonides' philosophy) and his- tory. Thus, what is formally "appropriate" about Maimon's characteriza- tion of cultural appropriation as theft is that he does not state this characterization in abstract terms, in accordance with the very impossi- bility of ever completely escaping the language of concrete historical- ity, an impossibility that is a crucial part of his message. Moreover, not just the quasi-fictionality but also the mixed mood of Maimon's text is "appropriate" to the matter at hand. For the notion that an individual could actually, properly belong to a culture, and that conversely a culture could actually belong to an individual, is a notion marked generally by a solemnity that tends toward the tragic. Indeed, the violent sacrifice of the individual hero for the sake of the consolidation of the identity of the community is the ritual of cultural identity-formation par excellence. (Think of post-World War I Ger- man nationalist celebrations of the war-dead, attended by people like Heidegger.20) In turn, comedy traditionally allows of an integration of the individual into the community that is not finally sacrificial. In the case of Maimon's text, however, the representation of cultural appropriation as theft takes on the mood of the tragicomic: violence is registered, but it is 20. Cf. George L. Mosse, Masses and Man: Nationalist and Fascist Perceptions of Reality (New York: Howard Fertig, 1980) 69-86; 263-84 passim.</page><page sequence="25">60 Stolen Goods a laughable violence, a violence of the laughable. More specifically, one is confronted here by the laughable violence of the picaresque novel in the tradition of Quixote, a tradition to which Maimon's autobiography alludes in manifold ways, and whose world is one in which illusions here, the ubiquitous illusions of any particular cultural identity in general - endlessly fail to be appropriate to the situation at hand. Let us take a look, then, at two scenes of theft in the novel, the first having manifestly more to do with the half-unwitting, yet illegitimate appropriation of the cultural discourse by the individual, while the second figures principally the converse, the absorption of the individual into a possessive and demanding culture. While each of the examples ramifies in complex ways and would therefore call for a more detailed, closer read- ing than I can provide here, I will underline in this context only the main traits of such a reading that are most relevant to my present argument. Toward the beginning of his autobiography, Maimon recounts the story of "the only theft I have ever committed" (49), even though he has already contradicted this claim (that it was the "only" theft he ever committed) by alluding to this theft in the thematic summary provided by the chapter-heading as "A theft a la Rousseau, but it is discovered" (48). The theft of Rousseau here, of Rousseau's famous scene of theft from the end of Book II of the Confessions, a textual theft by Maimon which is discovered through the very confession he provides in the chapter-heading, both functions as another example of theft by the nar- rator and suggests that perhaps the theft committed by the young Salomon ben Josua will have had something to do with the appropria- tion of a foreign culture, as French culture is foreign to Maimon. The story is simply this: the young Salomon, entering the house of a wealthy older relative with whose children he often plays, finds the room empty, then suddenly catches sight of "ein niedliches Medizin- sch&amp;ichtelchen" (49), a cute little medicine box, which just happens to belong to a little boy named Moses, and which pleases him. (Culture, the necessary supplement of nature, is not surprisingly figured here as medicine: it is good for what ails you.21) Opening the box, the young 21. On a number of occasions thereafter, Maimon starts to study medicine, but never manages to muster sufficient interest. Medicine figures from this theft on, then, an identity or a destiny to which Maimon's life repeatedly draws him but to which he never manages to commit himself, although he does become an apothecary. If medicine replaces the spiritual guidance of the Rabbi with the physical guidance of the physician, then Mai- mon's ambivalence about the medical profession would reflect his lingering ambivalence about the passage from sacred to secular.</page><page sequence="26">Jeffrey S. Librett 61 Salomon finds money inside. Although he has no interest in the money, he nonetheless steals the box along with the money it contains, because he fears making the absence of the box all the more noticable by leav- ing the money behind in the dresser where the box stands. Sleeplessly pursued by guilt, in particular because of the money, he decides to return it, while holding onto the box, "a work of art whose like I had never seen" (50). While returning the money, he is caught red-handed and forced to confess his theft and to return the box along with the money to the child, Moses, to whom they belong. Thereafter, in antici- pation of Jean Genet's fate, the young Salomon must content himself with being called "thief' - with having acquired the identity of "thief' - by the other children of the extended family. Now, in a certain sense, this sweetly silly little scene, the description of which in Maimon's text I have here exhausted, is quite insignificant and anecdotal. But on closer view, we can begin to see that this theft, "the only theft [Maimon has] ever committed" (and has perhaps never ceased committing), emblematizes Maimon's relationship to himself - to his cultural identity - first of all as a Jew, but derivatively also as a secularized Christian rationalist and as a would-be pagan natural theolo- gian. One might say, of course, that in the cases of the latter two cul- tural identifications, the character of the appropriation as theft is more obvious, since these identities were only beginning to be available to the Jews during the late Enlightenment as their potential cultural prop- erty. It is therefore all the more striking, however, that Maimon chooses to tell a story that allegorizes specifically his appropriation of the Jew- ish culture, i.e., of his "own" culture, in terms of theft.22 For the box is stolen not just from anyone but from "little Moses."23 What "belongs" to Moses is evidently Jewish culture as the law, although it "belongs" only improperly because Moses is traditionally only the vehicle of a law that is precisely not his own but God's. This culture, the Jewish law, 22. The notion that cultural appropriation is always inappropriate receives support from the analogous view Maimon takes of the relation between figures of speech and literal uses of language in "Was sind Tropen?" ( Versuch iiber die Transzendentalphilosophie, GW II: 303-32). Here Maimon argues, with astonishing boldness, that both proper and improper or figural uses of language are equally derivative with respect to the "transcendental con- cept" that conditions both. As no empirical use of language can be proper, so no empirical concretization of culture (as the cultural identity of an individual) can be proper. 23. Since not only the Biblical Moses, but also Moses Mendelssohn and Moses Maimonides come to be of enduring importance to Maimon, the attempt to appropriate Moses's possessions sets the stage for its repetition throughout his life.</page><page sequence="27">62 Stolen Goods comprises two aspects: its outward particularity and its inward univer- sality (or its truth or ultimate meaning), the former being figured here by the box itself, and the latter by the money in the box, a reading which is supported by Maimon's development elsewhere of the notion of coinage as a figure for truth in its universality.24 The fact that the young Salomon is interested in taking only the particular form of Juda- ism, while leaving behind its contents, suggests that he wishes to appro- priate the form by filling it with his own interpretation, his own version of its universality, as we have seen him trying to do above. In turn, the fact that he is thwarted in this endeavor, that the box comes with money inside that he can't manage to get rid of without giving up the box itself, suggests that Judaism contains its own particular form of univer- sality, and that universality cannot in general be separated from particu- larity: particularity usurps the place of universality and so fails to contain true universality. All appropriation of cultural particularity is forced to appropriate the false universality that this particularity implies and so to commit the fault of laying claim to the possession of a univer- sality that can only "properly" belong to another, to others, even if they too have stolen it in their turn. There is no form that is free of implica- tions, no culture that is equally open to all interpretations. The theft of the medicine box is "literally" Maimon's only theft recounted in his Autobiography. But there are several other scenes of theft in this text, all of which situate it as a privileged, ironic model of the appropriation of cultural-rhetorical identity and of the stabilization of a patriarchal lineage, one of which I will discuss here.25 This scene characterizes as theft what is in some respects the converse - or the mir- ror image - of the aspect of cultural appropriation in the previous scene. While there are some elements of the scene that concern the appropria- tion of the culture by the individual, from Salomon's standpoint,the emphasis must be placed on the way in which he is being appropriated by the culture, forced violently - but also comically - to be inscribed into the Jewish cultural continuum as a father in a patriarchal line. 24. See his essay, "Ober Wahrheit," in which the coinage of truth is further charac- terized as medicine for the mind GW I: 599-616. 25. Structures similar to those I am discussing are played out also, for example, in the scene where Salomon and his brothers contend for the buttons from the Russian sol- diers' uniforms (50-51), and in the mention of Kabbalist-charlatans who discovered thefts they themselves had committed (108), and also in his discussion of the appropriation of God through a knowledge of his attributes, part of his summary of Maimonides's negative theology, in the second Book of the Autobiography (264).</page><page sequence="28">Jeffrey S. Librett 63 In question here is the kidnapping of the young Salomon by the father of one of two women to whom Salomon comes to be simultaneously engaged, a kidnapping Maimon explicitly characterizes as a theft [Diebs- tahl]. How does Salomon come to be engaged simultaneously to two dif- ferent women, and how does this situation ramify? On the "literal" level, Madame Rissia, the widowed mother of the daughter with whom the first marriage contract has been signed, delays for some weeks before sending to Salomon's father the gifts she has contracted to send "as soon as possible" (59). Salomon's father therefore begins to doubt whether she is going to fulfill her contract; he suspects that the contract has already been suspended. It is the failure to pay a debt, then, or a kind of apparent or figural theft, which makes possible the second engagement. The second engagement comes about, however, not only because Salomon's father is prepared to seek it out but also because he is tricked into it, and precisely by means of a loan - which turns out, by way of blackmail, to become another kind of extortion or theft - from a man who wishes to possess the learned 11-year-old Salomon as his own son-in-law. The man who has his eye on Salomon is a merchant who sells whiskey, named Hersch Dukor. In order to indebt Salomon's father, he offers to lend him some barrels of whiskey, and Salomon's father willingly accepts. Nearing the end of the pay period, Dukor demands his money, which Salomon's father is incapable of paying back, as Dukor has predicted from the start. When Salomon's father begs for more time, Dukor offers to cancel the debt, on the condition that Salomon's father agree to marry Salomon off to Dukor's daughter, an offer the father eagerly accepts. When, shortly thereafter, Dukor hap- pens to go to Madame Rissia's inn, he and she start boasting to each other about their learned new sons-in-law and thereby comically dis- cover that these sons-in-law are the same person. Once Madame Rissia has established by law the priority of her contract, Dukor attempts to secure his son-in-law through kidnapping. This theft, however, like the theft of the medicine-box, is discovered almost immediately, and the stolen goods are returned to their apparently rightful place. What is the signification of the theft of Salomon by Dukor? What exactly has been stolen and by whom or by what? On the one hand, the stolen object here, Salomon, is in a position analogous to that of the medicine box in the scene discussed above, or rather of the gold it con- tains. This is so not merely because Salomon, like the medicine box with its contents of gold, is the object stolen, but because: a) his</page><page sequence="29">64 Stolen Goods impoverished father, himself also a Rabbi, makes a fair bit of money on the marriage arrangements, so that Salomon represents (his father's) gold; and b) his value as a good husband/son-in-law is based on the fact that he is a Wunderkind in the art of Talmudic scholarship. He repre- sents money because he represents the law. Like the contents of the box, Salomon is the Jewish law: as a little Talmudic genius, he embod- ies the law he nonetheless, unbeknownst to the others, cannot quite appropriate. Whereas in the first scene Salomon was stealing a culture not properly his own, now he is stolen by those who see embodied in him a culture - their own - they wish to appropriate (for their daugh- ters as for themselves). On the other hand, from Salomon's perspective, these parents of potential brides are representatives of a culture that, alien although his own, is in the process of imposing itself on him, inscribing him within itself by making him into a representative of it. In the formation of cultural identity, then, it seems that both the individ- ual's attempt to appropriate the culture and the culture's attempt to appropriate the individual must be seen as moments of theft.26 But if Dukor ends up giving Salomon back, and if Salomon ends up marrying his rightful bride, then does this not imply that there is a pos- sible inscription of the individual into culture, e.g., through insertion into the spousal and paternal function, that would precisely not be reducible to an instance of theft? In addition to all that has been said above which cuts against the grain of such a reading, the most salient point here is that Maimon's "rightful" marriage fails miserably to fulfill 26. The anecdote itself must be seen as such a double moment of theft, for in it Mai- mon appropriates (and is appropriated by) a piece of the Jewish cultural text, namely the judgment of King Salomon from Kings 1:3. In the Biblical text, the King must decide between two women each of whom claim that the living child is her own while the dead child is the child of the other. The name of the mother-in-law herself, Madame Rissia, evokes the German "RiB" for "rip" or "tear" and thus seems to put her in the position of the woman who was the false mother, the one who was content to see the child divided in two by King Salomon's sword. This connotation of her name, needless to say, does not speak well for the solution Maimon's life imposed. In a further distortion of the Biblical prefigu- ration, the text of Maimon's life puts King Salomon, the judge of the two women fighting over the child, into the position of the child itself, Salomon ben Josua. To make matters worse, if Maimon's two "brides" are to evoke the mothers in the Biblical tale, they cannot but evoke also the social-ethical status of these mothers, who were "harlots." Finally, since brides in general figure for Judaism the people Israel as the bride of God - and they figure this people because of none other than the Song of Salomon - the two brides in this story represent the double tradition, of reason and religion, of secular and sacred, of literal and figural expressions of the truth, of Christian and Jewish, into which Maimon will both marry and fail to marry, whichever tradition he marries, throughout the course of his life.</page><page sequence="30">Jeffrey S. Librett 65 itself in any meaningful way. As Maimon recounts years later in a still self-pitying yet comically exaggerated manner, the mother-in-law in fact renegs on her promises: for years Salomon suffers abuse at the hands of her and his wife. Moreover, the consummation of the marriage is itself long delayed. Of course, on the "literal" level, this is perfectly under- standable, for Maimon was eleven years old when the marriage occurred. But although Maimon acknowledges this as one factor in the delay, he also says that he "regarded a pretty girl just like any other work of nature or art, somewhat like the beautiful medicine box I once stole" (66). The consummation was delayed, then, because its object was an object which could be appropriated only improperly, like the law of a self that is other. In the context of radical inappropriateness that was his own, the girl was no more appropriable for him than his own tradition or than he was, as representative of the tradition, for her family in turn or for the tradition in general. It is not surprising, then, that after these rather inauspicious begin- nings Maimon ultimately abandons his family, without so much as looking back, almost as if he had never had one, and that he finally grants his wife a divorce long after, when she seeks him out in Ger- many, child in tow, to demand angrily her liberation from their con- tract. Maimon does not finally take his generational place within his culture of origin in any unambiguous way, even in the sense of occup- ing a determinate paternal-spousal position. In this light, Dukor's failed theft of Salomon is not so much the opposite of a successful rightful contract as rather the figure of the marriage Salomon went on to have. Here the notion of a "failed theft" no longer means simply that there was a theft first which thereafter was undone but rather that the theft and the undoing of the theft are simultaneous. To lay hold of what can- not be properly one's own is always to loosen one's hold on it. The sto- len goods of culture, then, are returned when it is realized that they are stolen, but as soon as they are returned to where they belong, they return as stolen. The result of a violent inscription of the individual in the culture and of the culture in the individual, cultural identity is always a doubly stolen good. Maimon's representation of cultural appropriation combines the most advanced Enlightenment position - that all cultural particularity equally embodies and ultimately refers to its essential, universal humanity -</page><page sequence="31">66 Stolen Goods with its Counterenlightenment reversal - that there is no essential uni- versal humanity except as embodied in one, particular, absolutely privi- leged culture. For Maimon, all cultures embody universal humanity - and so the actual essence of the individual - with equal inadequacy. For Maimon, there is no avoiding cultural particularity - this is the Counterenlightenment or historicist moment - but all cultural particu- larity is alienated, inauthentic, improper: both stolen from someone else to whom in turn it does not properly belong, and constitutively stealing the individual from him- or herself. If such a thought speaks usefully to us in our current historico-theoretical conjuncture, I have suggested, this is because our conjuncture repeats in certain respects the situation of German discourse after the Counterenlightenment had begun, roughly during the period of German Neoclassicism. The best eighteenth-cen- tury "model" for our own situation, then, would perhaps not be Enlight- enment rationality pure and simple, nor certainly an irrationalist identity-politics on the Counterenlightenment model, but the principles of a Neoclassicism that was situated beyond the limits of Neoclassical Greco-Roman cultural particularism, a Neoclassicism for which all cul- tural roads and none would lead to Rome (or Athens or Jerusalem). For such a nonclassicist classicism, cultural identity is ideology, as the ines- capably imaginary element of our relation to the real. Yet the ideology of cultural identity is one that we can - if not escape, then at least - relativize to the (limited) extent of knowing it to be an illustration of the universal humanity of inescapable historicity and acculturation. We can know, in other words, that what is universally human is the loss (through one's cultural particularity) of immediate contact with what is universally human. What is universally human is having to do without a metacultural or metahistorical definition of human universality, i.e., of cultural history. Humanity is therefore not knowing what humanity is. And that much we can know.</page></plain_text>
