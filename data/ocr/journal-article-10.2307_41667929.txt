Significant depths were reached in only two of the trenches (A and G) where the maximum depths reached were 6.10 m. and 5.75 m., respectively. Excavations in the re- maining soundings, none of which exceeded a depth of 1.50 m. were temporarily suspended earlier because of the diffi- culties involved in penetrating the great accumulation of fallen stone. Drawing by Marian Holland McAllister. During the course of our excavation in 1966 at the Classical site of Halieis near Porto Cheli in the southern Argolid, Professor Michael H. Jameson of the University of Pennsylvania and the writer were told about a large cave in the neighborhood of the nearby village of Koilada. We had been in Koilada a number of times previously and had seen the site from a distance, but never had an opportunity to visit the cave. Therefore, when we learned of its vast size and the possibility of prehistoric remains - not to mention the fact that it was sometimes called ''The Cave of the Cyclops" - our curiosity was sufficiently aroused to take time off from the excavation in order to have a look at the site. The cave is located near the western tip of a high and rugged headland known as Franchthi, directly across the bay from Koilada. It is a coastal cave whose mouth lies about fifteen meters above the modern sea level and opens to the northwest. There is a small rocky terrace in front of the cave and, beneath it, a gradual slope down to the shore, some fifty meters or more away. The eroded base of this slope, just above the water's edge, produced countless potsherds and other objects clearly indicating that the site was in- habited during the Neolithic period. In the light of the high quality of these finds and since the Neolithic 5</page><page sequence="3">Vessels from the Middle Neolithic period. (Left) A large stand with typical cutout decoration.

FRANCHTHI CAVE continued period had been practically unknown in this part of the Argolid, we sought and were speedily granted per- mission by the Greek Archaeological Service to in- clude the investigation of this cave in our overall archaeological program (the Argolid Exploration Proj- ect of Indiana University and the University of Penn- sylvania). Moreover, it was important for our in- vestigation to begin promptly because the site was becoming increasingly popular as a picnic ground for residents of the neighborhood. Therefore, our first season of excavation took place during the summer of 1967. The site is a large limestone cavern oriented ap- proximately northwest-southeast and reaches a depth of nearly one hundred fifty meters. Its total width at the mouth is about thirty meters. Only a comparatively small portion of the entire area could be excavated, however, since much of the mouth and a considerable part of the interior are now covered with massive rubble or "breakdown" resulting from a collapse of the brow and the roof. The collapse of the latter has left a great opening in the roof (called a "Karst Window") near the center of the cavern. Indeed, only the rocky terrace in front of the cave and an area twenty to thirty meters deep just inside the mouth were reasonably free for excavation. Never- theless, excavation turned out to be extremely difficult everywhere because of the large amount of fallen stone. Five sticks of dynamite were not, in fact, suf- ficient to open up one of the trenches on the terrace. Seven soundings were attempted during the 1967 season: three within the cave (A, F and G) and four on the terrace in front of the cave (B, C, D and E). Delays brought about by excavating and removing the rockfall prevented us from reaching bedrock in any of the trenches. Trenches A and G produced similar stratigraphie sequences. Beneath a rather shallow deposit of surface soil resting upon an often very deep accumulation of loose rubble, pure Neolithic levels were reached. The surface soil produced some objects of Classical and post-Classical times, but there is as yet no clear-cut evidence of Bronze Age occupation in the cave. All of the major subdivisions of the (Ceramic) Neolithic period are represented among the abundant remains from these trenches. Indeed, over one hundred baskets of potsherds were collected from Trenches A and G alone. The Late Neolithic period (the fourth millen- nium b.c.) is characterized by rather coarse and poorly made pottery, yet finer wares certainly are present. Potsherds bearing patterned decoration in matt (dull) paint (dark on light, light on dark and polychrome) are common. An outstanding piece is a very large storage vessel (pithos) with linear decora- tion in light matt paint applied to a lustrously bur- nished black ground. Its restored diameter is over half a meter, and it must have stood at least a meter high when complete. The Middle Neolithic period 6</page><page sequence="4">Neolithic arrowheads (numbers 1 to 4) and blade (number 5) of obsidian. The largest piece (4) is ca. 5 cm. long. (perhaps the later sixth millennium and the fifth millennium b.c.) is particularly well represented among the finds from the cave. By far the most char- acteristic ceramic class of this phase is the handsome and extremely well made ware decorated with a nat- urally lustrous reddish-brown to black paint (Ur- firnis), so well-known from the American excavations at Corinth and Lerna. Several vessels of this class have been at least partially restored. A substantial deposit of the Early Neolithic period (probably most of the earlier sixth millennium b.c.) has yet to be found, but a number of potsherds belonging to the "Spongy" and "Variegated" or "Rainbow" classes characteristic of this period elsewhere in the Pelopon- nese have appeared among the lowest pottery-bearing levels. Indeed, the only Neolithic burial yet found in the Franchthi Cave seems to belong to the beginning of this period: a small child (probably female) dis- covered at the depth of about 4.70 m. in Trench A. The skeleton, which disintegrated readily upon touch, was laid out on its left side in a severely contracted position with the knees drawn up tightly beneath the chin. The child's head rested upon a "pillow" of small stones and was oriented roughly to the south. There were no recognizable grave goods. From what little is known of other Early Neolithic burials, this prac- tice seems to be quite standard for the whole of Greece. Flint points (numbers 1 and 2) and a scraper (number 3).

Neolithic stone celts found in the Franchthi Cave, largest, 7 cm. long. In addition to the ceramic remains, over one hun- dred fifty objects of bone, stone, shell and clay were inventoried during the course of the 1967 season. Ground and polished stone tools were particularly common in the more advanced stages of the Neolithic period. Chipped or flaked stone tools of flint and ob- sidian were especially numerous. With the exception of obsidian, which was probably imported from the island of Melos in the southern Aegean, all of the various kinds of stone used for the tools and other objects from this site seem to be quite readily avail- able in the southern Argolid.

The quality of the preceramic stone indus- tries thus far excavated in the Franchthi Cave is not impressive. tary figurines (usually female) of stone and clay were unearthed. A fragment of a female figurine of well- known Neolithic type - a steatopygous "Mother God- dess" - turned up in a Middle Neolithic context in Trench A. It was made of clay and was coated with a thin application of Urfirnis paint, Also of Middle Neo- lithic date is a small stone amulet of anthropomorphic shape from Trench G. Among the other objects of stone are a few fragments of vessels generally belong- ing to the earlier stages of the (Ceramic) Neolithic period. A variety of objects of bone, especially pol- ished points or awls, and shell turned up in most of the Neolithic levels. The season's most notable discovery in the Franchthi Cave was the exposure of a deposit - at least a meter deep in Trench G though somewhat less in Trench A - of aceramic remains beneath the pot- tery levels in each of the deep soundings. Although there was absolutely no trace of pottery in this deposit, it did contain chipped tools of both flint and obsidian (flint was far more common than obsidian), bone points, snail shells and many bones of mammals and fish. After a preliminary study of the mammal bones, Mr. Sebastian Payne of Cambridge University sug- gested that they could be divided tentatively into two groups: the lower (earlier), characterized by the ab- sence of sheep and goat and the predominance of red deer and cattle; and the upper (later), characterized by the sudden appearance of sheep and goat (sheep are more common than goat but both are definitely present), a reciprocal decrease in the frequency of red deer and cattle and an increase in the frequency of swine. This change occurs substantially before the first appearance of any quantity of pottery. Thereafter (i.e., during the subsequent Ceramic Neolithic pe- riod), sheep and goat bones remain common but ap- pear to become smaller in size and there is a greater number of bones from immature animals. Since it now seems to be widely accepted that domestication brings about not only a decrease in the size of do- mesticated animals but also an increase in the number of immature animals killed, our evidence certainly points to the existence of domesticated sheep and goat. The earlier aceramic deposit reached a maximum excavated depth of nearly a meter in Trench G 8</page><page sequence="6">(again, somewhat less in Trench A) and showed no obvious signs of animal domestication. The bones of fish, many of which may have been a meter or more in length, were also considerably more numerous in this deposit. The earliest known inhabitants of the Franchthi Cave clearly relied on both hunting and fishing as means of procuring their food supply. Because of the comparatively small size of the sam- ples analyzed up to now, these observations are neces- sarily subject to revision upon further excavation and much more study. They must be supplemented, if at all possible, by evidence indicating the presence of domesticated plants; and a thorough examination of the artifacts, particularly the implements of stone, should help to clarify the problem. Nevertheless, Mr. Payne's observations do suggest, at least tentatively, that we have some evidence here for the very critical transition from that stage in man's history when he was principally a nomadic hunter or "food-collector" to the stage when he first came to produce his own food supply by means of the domestication of plants and animals. This transitional period is sometimes called the "Agricultural Revolution," and - because of the enormous impact it had on the life of prehis- toric man - it must be recognized as one of the most important eras in human history. At the moment, the beginnings of agriculture are best understood in the Near East, where indeed the "revolution" may have taken place first. Only one major site - Argissa in Thessaly - has yet demon- strated a comparable phenomenon in Greece. Yet the Franchthi Cave, since there is no apparent break be- tween the lower and upper pre-ceramic levels (such as there seems to be at Argissa) , may prove to be the first site in Greece to provide evidence of direct con- tinuity from the period traditionally called "Meso- lithic" (i.e., post-Ice Age, terminal food-collecting) to Aceramic Neolithic (i.e., introduction of domesti- cation) . It is certainly the first site in southern Greece to illustrate what appear to be the beginnings of ani- mal domestication and hence the first Aceramic Neo- lithic site on the Greek mainland outside of Thessaly. Finally, some general remarks can now be made with regard to the absolute chronology of the Franch- thi Cave since three charcoal samples from different levels in the two deep soundings have been analyzed by the radioactive carbon (Cl4) method at the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania. Although we do not yet know how early the site was inhabited by man, one of these determinations indicates that the "Mesolithic" period came to an end here around, or very shortly before, 7000 B.c. (In spite of the currently preferred value of the C14 "half-life," these dates are given in terms of the old estimate of 5568 years so as to con- form to the traditional chronology. Therefore they are probably too young by several hundred years.) The subsequent period (Aceramic Neolithic) must have been of considerable duration since it seems to have ended around 6000 b.c. or perhaps shortly there- after. The Early (Ceramic) Neolithic period, how- ever, does not appear to have lasted very long for our third determination indicates that the Middle Neo- lithic period was under way here at least by 5200 B.c. This chronology is of course provisional, and the va- lidity of its dates can be properly assessed only after a number of additional samples have been submitted for analysis. After one brief season of excavation, many ques- tions have arisen that are naturally still unanswered. When was this site first inhabited by man ? Was ani- mal domestication the result of gradual development locally, or did it stem from a sudden impulse from abroad? More importantly, did the domestication of plants appear at the same time as animal domestica- tion ? It will be the objective of subsequent seasons of excavation here and perhaps elsewhere to answer these and the many other questions that will inevitably arise, but it must be borne in mind that the study of these very early periods - especially in Greece - is only in its infancy. Several more sites must be care- fully investigated before our understanding of the pe- riods encompassing the transition from food-collec- tion to food-production reaches even the present state of knowledge in the Near East. Yet it may be said that the Franchthi Cave now appears to be the earliest dated Neolithic site in Greece ; and, since none of our soundings has yet reached bedrock, there is good rea- son to hope for the first substantial evidence of Palae- olithic occupation in southern Greece when our exca- vations are resumed in 1968.
