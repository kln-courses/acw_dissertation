<plain_text><page sequence="1">201 THE MYTHIC STYLE IN TWO PHILIPPINE FOLK NARRATIVES Resil B. Mojares This study will involve three related opera? tions: (1) a discussion of significant stylistic features of two Philippine folk narratives, The Maiden of the Buhong Sky and The Epic of Labaw Donggon; (2) an identification of the elements of the "genuine myth" (Jensen 1963: 68-76) in these texts; and (3) a description of the "mythic style" as revealed in the two texts under study. In view of these plural aims, the conclusions of this paper can only be tentative. Its limitations are obvious: it attempts a description of a general style on the basis of only two texts and without the benefit of extensive cross-cul? tural comparisons; and, what is perhaps more dubious, it attempts judgments on style on the basis of texts-in-translation. It is written with this one purpose: to suggest an explanation for certain stylistic peculiarites of oral literature, peculiarities that often render such literature unimpressive to the modern leader. I aim to show that the stylistic character of the texts under study is ultimately derived from the character of the mythic ideology itself. In this way it is hoped that a clearer appreciation of oral literature will be promoted. The Narratives Under study are two microepics: The Maiden of the Buhong Sky and The Epic of Labaw Donggon. The first, recorded by E. Arsenio Manuel in the original Manuvu, accompanied by an English translation, belongs to the 40,000 line Tuwaang epic cycle of the Manuvu of Central Mindanao. The second, recorded in the original Kiniray-a and in English translation by F. Landa Jocano, is part of the 53,000-line Hinilawod epic cycle found among the Sulod of Central Panay. Both texts, recorded in 1955-57, are based on the dictation of native bards. A three generation background is posited for both texts. While both carry marks of acculturative in fluence, it can be safely assumed that they have their original matrix in precontact times. Jocano says that the Sulod epic is made to be chanted; Manuel says that the Manuvu epic is sung and that the bard sometimes breaks into a dance while reciting it. Both narratives are heard in communal gatherings and are objects of almost reverential awe by their listeners inasmuch as they serve to strengthen group pride and solidarity. Jocano notes the magico-religious uses of the epic; Manuel is less clear on this point. It can be safely assumed though that both epics are drawn out of a religious or cultic matrix. Both verse-narratives deal with a unified action, centering on the adventure of a culture hero or deraa-deity. (Jensen uses the Marind anim term Dema for the collectivity of divine beings of the primal past who by their creative activity engendered the present order of things, 1963:88-92.) In the Manuvu narrative, the central action concerns Tuwaang's struggle with the Young Man of Pangumanon in defense of the Maiden of the Buhong Sky. In the Sulod narrative, it revolves on Labaw Donggon's wooings and his fight with Buyong Saragnayan. Both share many motifs, especially those per? taining to the journey and the magical powers of their heroes, and the similarities can be ex? tended if we use as supplementary material the Lumabat myth reported by Laura Watson Benedict (1913, 1916) among the Bagobos, a tale closely related to the narrative recorded by Manuel. The Maiden of the Buhong Sky was initially identified as a Bagobo microepic, an error of identification later corrected by Manuel (1973:3). Since the Bagobo and Manuvu share similar geographical and cultural backgrounds, I shall freely relate one to the other in this paper. This paper will not attempt a detailed study of content and of phonetic, syntactic and metrical qualities and arrangements. It is</page><page sequence="2">202 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY sufficient for present purposes to isolate what the writer believes to be the dominant stylistic characteristics of the two texts and to provide an explanation for these characteristics. In view of the paucity of stylistic studies on oral literature, I would like to introduce at this point a few preliminary observations on the problem of critical method. In approaching these texts it is important for the reader to remember that these are oral narratives created and experienced communally. Respect for the oral dimension should prevent the reader from committing the elementary mistake of expect? ing from such literature the sort of aesthetic values bred of print. Consideration of the communal dimension should also lead to an im? portant revision of critical attitude. The Manuvu and Sulod epics are both experienced in a per? formance consisting not just of words but of melody, actor's movements, spectacle, and audience participation. Thus, it has been suggested that it might do better justice to the content, design and function of works of this kind if we take them as a kind of theater in? stead of evaluating them as poetry and fiction, in the way these latter forms are understood today (Jacobs 1959:7). And even this is not enough: the cultic dimension of mythic literature demands that the critic take these works not just as theater but as ritual. A further note: the realization of the communal and oral transmission of this literature should lead to an awareness of the progressive and regressive metamorphoses of style and content that may affect such works. They exist in a state of constant flux, and a true appreciation of the text must view the work not simply as it stands at a given point of time but in flux. Finally, an awareness of this literature's com? munal origin should lead to a corresponding appreciation of how much more intimately and directly implicated the community's world view is in folk literature than in the more high? ly-differentiated creative literature of our time. A sympathy for the "folk mind" then is basic for the understanding of folk literature. The Element of Repetition I shall limit myself to the discussion of two dominant characteristics of the style of the narratives under consideration: (1) the use of repetition in both language and action, and (2) the elliptical, discontinuous nature of the plot. Repetition in both language and action is obtrusive in the works under study and discon? certing to the modern reader. In language, it is seen in the reiteration of line-endings, phrases and sentences, and the stereotyping of meta? phors and other figurative devices. This is join? ed to the repetition of gestures, movements, and plot sequences. Jocano notes this feature and offers stylistic justifications for it: that it "functions as a point of reference and an occasion for the poet [and the listener] to organize the threads of [the] story;" that it creates "an emphatic move? ment in the rhythm . . . and a leisurely style in the unfolding of the story;" that it is used to emphasize particular situations, actions and ob? jects; that it is used for magic formulas or it may be that certain word-units are used to fit the demands of meter and rhyme (Jocano 1967: 305-307). He also quotes a Sulod informant who says that repetition is after all in the nature of life itself, for human activities, like dressing and eating, are repetitious (Jocano, ibid.). The presence of pattern in the use of num? ber belongs to this feature. In the Sulod epic there are three brothers, three wooings, three sisters, and three stages to Labaw Donggon's fight with Saragnayan. In addition, there are two sons; Labaw's enemy is submerged for seven years and there is a magic arrow that hits once but leaves seven deadly wounds. In the same epic, lines and verses are fre? quently repeated throughout the poem, with only one or two different words introduced into the repeated lines. A repetitive rhyme scheme is used: a-a-a-a I an-an-an-an I un-un-un un. We see the repetition of descriptive passages, especially (and expectedly) when describing repetitive actions, as when Labaw Donggon is described putting on his hat, headband, waist? band and belt (in 11. 35-54, 409-436, 580-617, 922-941, 989-1012). There is the use of stereo? typed metaphors, as in the comparison of the woman to the hikay (kind of shrimp) and banalak (a kind if fish), of her whiteness to the</page><page sequence="3">Mojares / MYTHIC STYLE 203 inside of banana stalks or split bamboo (in 11. 130-134, 195-196, 210-213, 523-529); in the hyperbole of the force of voice reverberating around the world or breaking bamboo tops (in 11. 667-675, 1383-1392, 2316-2325); or in the comparison, found frequently enough in literature, of the hero to a god or visiting deity (in 11. 618-621, 738-741, 1029-1031, 1076 1078). Repetitive action is joined to certain ritualis? tic sequences in the narrative: Labaw Donggon dressing up or the magic boat being purified with native incense. Repetitiveness is inherent in the structure of the adventure itself: the hero goes to woo three women one after the other; he fights his enemy in three phases; his sons also fight the enemy and his allies in cumulative stages. The same pattern of repetition is illustrated by the Manuvu epic. The Bagobo-Manuvu cos? mos is made up of nine skyworlds, through a number of which the hero travels. There are three sequences of ceremonious betel-nut chew? ing. The fight between Tuwaang and the Young Man of Pangumanon goes through repetitive stages and this sequence is later repeated in the fight between Tuwaang and an unknown young man. The sequence involving the "maiden shrouded in darkness" is adumbrated in an earlier sequence involving Tuwaang's sister. As in the Sulod epic, we see verbal repetition in the use of stereotyped metaphors (e.g., the man-sun, man-tree, man-cock similes), in the recurrence of descriptive passages (e.g., the description of the hero's appearance, of the betel-nut chewing ceremony), in the use of repeated syllables, instead of rhymes, at line endings; and in the metronomic syntactic constructions. In summary, therefore, the repetitiveness resides in the structure of the plot itself, using the pattern of a hero's adventure that proceeds by stages. There is then an accretion of similar sequences and, inasmuch as the form employs stock tags, metaphors and descriptive passages, repetition becomes a dominant stylistic feature of the narrative. There are many possible explanations for this repetitive style. One can invoke the repetitive character of everyday activities, as Jocano's Sulod informant did, as well as the limited range of folk life itself. Another is the influence of custom restricting the free play of the in? dividual bard's creativity, thus ensuring the persistence of fixed stylistic conventions. Join? ed to this is the use of reiteration as a mnemonic aid, in the manner of sensory imprinting. An obvious and substantial explanation lies in the repetitive character of the rituals and cere? monials ubiquitous in tales of this kind. In this we have a reflection of the ritualism per? vading Manuvu and Sulod social and religious life. For illustrations, see Manuel 1973:243, 362-365; Jocano 1968:241-270. Such explanations need to be integrated. The integrative principle is to be looked for in the content, design and function of myth itself. (This I shall attempt to do in the concluding section of this paper.) The Discontinuous Plot Another feature modern readers find curious in the style of works such as those under study is the discontinuous and segmented character of the plot and its development. Melville Jacobs refers to this characteristic when he notes that the lack of visual and emotional documentation in oral literature makes for a terse and succinct style (1959: 266-267). Transitions and connective links between actions and episodes are often elided. Certain episodes are left undeveloped, and motivations submerged. Thus, it is not explained why Tuwaang fell asleep when he arrived for his meeting with the Maiden of the Buhong Sky. In the same epic, it is not clear to us how the sky worlds were devastated by fire. Further? more, we do not know who the young man of the second fight-sequence was or what necessary function in the plot is performed by the Young Man of Pongovukad. Here, as in the Sulod epic, there is an unsettling quality of incompleteness. This vagueness for the modern reader, of course, mainly results from his unfamiliarity with the cultural and literary context of the work. In the first place, the works here referred to are after all but fragments of longer epic cycles - the Hinilawod of Panay and the</page><page sequence="4">204 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Tuwaang of Cotabato-Davao-Bukidnon. Con? sequently, references to the other episodes or fragments will have to be made, for these cycles exist as totalities. In the second place, there is the larger socio cultural context to consider. These narratives are richly impregnated with the social and religious values and practices of the people from whom they have sprung and through whom they are transmitted. Thus, the amorous adventures of Labaw Donggon gain a measure of credibility if viewed against the practice of plural marriages in the Sulods' past. Tuwaang's adventure acquires added motivation if we see him as a bahani, the warrior-leader whose job it is to right wrongs and exact revenge (Manuel 1973:208, 311). In the same manner, too, we understand the excessive attention accorded to the character's appearance and dress if we con? sider it in the light of what Benedict notes as concerns the Bagobos' association of beauty in personal adornment with virtuous character (1916:70). In the third place, we have to consider the nature of the literary activity itself. Here we find an explanation for the terse, elliptical and speedy development of the action: Each myth, and each phrase within a myth, functioned in a raconteur-audience-community relationship of shared participation, because literary creativity resided as much in the community as in the storyteller of the evening. That which was familiar to all was treated with an extreme of selectivity as well as with a special kind of stylization. Only a few features of a situation or actor were chosen for mention; they were worded succinctly and in traditional manner. The narrator's terse phrases were, in current terminology, coded signals. Audience members reacted by decoding, reconstruct? ing, filling in, and by a variety of such other res? ponses as identification and project (Jacobs: 1959:5). But the elliptical, discontinuous character of the plot also resides in the very nature of the mythic material itself. We can illustrate this by the vagueness which attends the time and space dimensions of the narratives.. One notes in these texts a basic lack of detail and documentation which make it hard for the reader to achieve a balanced sense of location, distance, and duration. In these narratives, it is stereotypical for activities to be accomplished in "a magic instant". When the hero is born, he is "suddenly" a grown man who can speak. A battle may last for days, yet it is presented as though it were simply a flash of moments. The enemy is submerged under water for seven years and yet its treatment in a few terse lines suggests a temporal duration that is brief. The reader does not get a clear sense of the spatial relationships of the skyworlds in the Manuvu epic. In the Sulod epic, we have the employment of stereotyped place names ? "land of the Dawning Sun", "land of night", "by the mouth of Handog, the river Halawud", "in the underworld", "the place called Dingli, the land of the stone walls" ? but beyond such tags and citations, we are given no opportunity to see the places themselves. They remain a mysterious, hazy, and almost invisible back? ground against which we see the characters speaking, chewing betel-nut, fighting, or putting on adornments. One can of course justify all this by remem? bering that we have here a series of magical activities and places; and magic and the super? natural involve a suspension of ordinary tem? poral and spatial experience. Still, this does not fully explain the very curious type of space time experience in these narratives. We find in the narratives a radical disorien tation of temporal and spatial relationships brought about and heightened by the fact that while the narrative truncates and glosses over key characters, episodes and places, it also focuses with excessive detail on a number of minor areas and activities in the plot. Note the very detailed description of Tuwaang's adorn? ments or of his sister's coming out of the room as against the summariness with which the major episodes are treated. Note, further, the close attention given to such minor details as the sound of the door-latch or the color and design of the hero's hat and leglets as against the bare mention of the skyworlds and the Land of the Dawning Sun. In the Manuvu epic, the creaking of the door latch is compared to the squealing of a pig "grunting because she wants to be fed for the</page><page sequence="5">Mojares / MYTHIC STYLE 205 sun is setting in the west", and when the squealing declined "it seemed to be the shrill cry of the hornbill, the cause of her wail her being worried over her food, the merang fruit, which will be consumed in a couple of days and will be gone in three, blaming the burning bird, and accusing the bayaku for taking the fruits sneakingly, for harvesting them stealthily." (II. 152-171). The detail of documentation here is rich but it is also stylistically redundant, for the details of the hog asking to be fed or the hornbill blaming the buruing bird and the bayaku for eating the merang fruit show the bard's over-indulgence on the vehicle to the point where it pushes the tenor of the meta? phor (the sound of the door-latch) out of the focal point of attention. Such extended, digressive descriptions recall the Homeric simile and are common to Malay folk literature as pointed out by the scholar R.O. Winstedt (1941-1953). There are many cases similar to the one just cited in the narratives under study. What we have here is a clash of two experiences: the abstracted, truncated presentation of major areas of the action, on one hand, and the detailed, naturalistic documentation of minor details, on the other. At this point, a number of complementary explanations can be offered for such a dis? junctive style. It may be noted that the detailed recording of certain activities (e.g., dressing up in preparation for a journey) is ex? pressive of the great importance attached by the community to the correct observance of ritual techniques, the violation of which brings upon the person ill fortune or death. Furthermore, superfluous details, usually taking the form of extended metaphors, may have been included owing to the exigencies of sustaining a given rhyme or rhythmic pattern. It is also possible that such details may be an overlay to the original story, added by an improvising bard. Also, such details may simply be expressive of the naturalistic, perceptual world-view of archaic peoples. Finally, such documentation, in so far as they apply to material objects, may express the value placed by these peoples on possessions; and in like manner, it may be a device of characterization, used to enhance the character's virtue and status. We hope to integrate these explanations in the concluding section of this paper, in the description of what we shall call, for our pur? poses, "the mythic style". At this point, in a preliminary step, it must be shown that the narratives under study - called by both Manuel and Jocano popular folk epics, or microepics ? are mythic, or perhaps more precisely what Ad. E. Jensen calls a degenerate form of the "genuine myth" (1963: 68-76). The Mythic Frame Both epics, as pointed out by Manuel and Jocano themselves, manifest a heavy accultu rative overlay. A thoroughgoing analysis of the nature and degree of this overlay is not attempted by either scholar, nor is it the intention of this paper to attempt such a com? plex and tricky enterprise. It is sufficient for present purposes to simply draw attention to certain aspects of the texts which suggest the dramatization of a primordial myth. We take myth here in the sense it is defined by Mircea Eliade: a sacred history relating a primordial event at the beginning of time, showing gods and culture heroes in a state of creative activity (Eliade 1959:95). To start with the Manuvu epic. There is un? doubtedly a mythic frame to The Maiden of the Buhong Sky. Benedict speaks of the Bagobo's belief in a "mythical period" during which the world was inhabited by the mona (Jensen's demadeities, 1963:88-92), deities also found in the Manuvu pantheon (Manuel 1973: 246). This was in the time before "the present order of things", a time when people knew no death and could metamorphose from animal to human form, and vice versa; a time marked by natural abundance and the golden flourishing of the arts and crafts (Benedict 1916:65-74). Various folk literary sources suggest that this mythic era came to an end through a primal enmity, taking the form of either a quarrel or a slaying (Raats 1969: 10-12, 24,83).With this the period of mortal man began. It is in this context that the story of Tu waang must be seen, for Tuwaang is a dema</page><page sequence="6">206 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY deity living in the mythic period. He parallels Lumabat, the deity of the first Bagobo sky world, who brought his followers up to heaven, and his powers and exploits correspond to those cited by Benedict of the malaki, male deities of the mythic era. The malaki could ride on his shield or on the wind, slay his enemies by simply holding up his sword, cause daylight to turn into darkness by holding up his spear, make his enemies' weapons dissolve, cast off radiance from his body, and resurrect the dead. The skyworlds of Bagobo and Manuvu be? lief figure in the Buhong Sky epic. It is possible that with data from the other parts of the Tuwaang epic-cycle and other supplementary literary texts, a clearer correspondence can be effected between Tuwaang and Lumabat and between the Maiden of the Buhong Sky and one of the female deities of the Bagobo Manuvu skyworlds. At this stage, it is of interest to suggest an explanation of the phenomenon of "the maiden shrouded in dark? ness". Eliade cites a popular belief among palaeo-agricultural peoples that "the girl who at her first menstruation spends three days in a dark hut without speaking to anyone [does so] because the murdered maiden, having become the moon, remains three days in darkness". (Eliade 1959:101-102). This is also noted by Jensen (1963:200-201), and the practice of confining menstruating girls exists among certain Philippine tribes (Demetrio 1970:609). This is strongly echoed in the Manuvu epic, for in this narrative two maidens are in fact pre? sented as being enclosed or shrouded in dark? ness. This suggests a tabu enforced in comme? moration of the primordial murder that sepa? rated the mythic from the mortal period. It is relevant to note that Benedict cites as one of the popular Bagobo tales the enmity between sun and moon, a tale popular in a number of variant forms among archaic cultivators. In the Bagobo tale, the sun kills the moon's daughter out of disappointment that the child turned out to be a girl. The parts of the girl's body are then scattered and become the stars. In other versions, the moon hides the girl in a box and a dialogue between sun and moon refers to the girl's rejection because her body, like that of the moon, is dark (Benedict 1913:17-18). In other variants still, the child is eaten or parts of her body are scattered, out of which come into being fishes and plants. All these are closely reminiscent of the mythologem (i.e., mythic theme) of the primordial murder which intro? duced procreation and death into the world, a theme that Jensen calls "the basic formulation of the world view of the archaic root-crop culti? vators". (1963:92). It is clearly a primal murder which is commemorated in the blood-sacrifice of human victims and the offering of the fruit of the field at Bagobo festivals called ginum, during which special types of chants are per? formed (Benedict 1916:9). All this suggests that a "genuine myth" is the original model and content of the Tuwaang story. This fact leads to the inevitable con? clusion that (1) the content of the story can be understood only within this mythic frame? work, and that (2) its style will have to be assessed in the light of the functions of myth. To proceed now to the Sulod epic: The cultural history of the Sulod is not as clear or as full as that of the Bagobo or Manuvu. But a belief in a my thic era can also be safely assumed for this group on the basis of the cultural data presented by Jocano (1965:13, 18, 30-31; 1968:268-270). The Epic of Labaw Donggon clearly suggests a mythic matrix; its characters with their supernatural attributes are clearly dema-deities. The interesting figure in the epic is Buyong Saragnayan who is referred to as the Keeper of Light living at the "foot of the eastern horizon" and controlling the course of the sun. There is the motif binding the vitality of Saragnayan with the vitality of nature itself. When upon being vanquished he weakens, the world of living things suffers: Saragnayan returned home. The plants are now withering The leaves were wilting. They were lifeless And drooping. Even the tiny weeds turned Brown and dry. (11. 1830-1836)</page><page sequence="7">Mojares / MYTHIC STYLE 207 When he dies, the whole world is shaken: And it sent atrembling The whole world And when Saragnayan fell The earth quaked terribly For it was in Saragnayan's body That the earthquake was kept. (11. 2002-2008) Furthermore, we are told that Saragnayan's breath was kept in a pig's heart which Labaw Donggon's sons had to kill and eat to vanquish the god. Again, this suggests the mythologem of the primal murder and the consequent change in the order of things. The mythologem is not centrally or fully developed in the epic itself but it is to be remembered that our text is merely a part of a longer cycle and, being a recent recording, it is heavily overlaid with later acculturative in? fluences. The "law of semantic depletion" (Jensen 1963: 76-79) has left us with a heavily adulterated and heterogeneous story. This is not the moment for a full evaluation of this depletion. It is sufficient for our purpose to note that what we have here is a broken-down myth and that its full evaluation must, there? fore, take into account the stylistic and thematic configuration of myth. The Mythic Style It remains now for us to point out the dis? tinctive features of what we shall call "the mythic style". Here we must be guided by the principle that form is never more than an extension of content. As Jacobs expresses it, style and content are "contrasted extremes in an intergrading continuum of interacting features" (1959:4). In this light, the rationale for the mythic style is to be found in the design of myth itself. First, we must consider the nature of the reality imitated in myth. As pointed out earlier (p. 205), the genuine myth deals with the creative activity of the gods at "the beginning of time", at the period when the primal era came to an end and "the present Order of things" came about, or as Eliade (1959) puts it: in the transition from sacred to profane time. Myth is a record and a commemoration of this sacred reality. This reality is constituted by a number of primordial events still vividly remem? bered and of dema-deities who live in an eter? nal present. The mythic world is conceived in the literary presentation as vaguely geomorphic and its inhabitants as anthropomorphic, but they are situated in a dimension different from that which we inhabit today. While this former state is conceived to be similar to the present in many respects, it remains a reality that is distinct and separate. Hence, in the literary des? criptions of this era, we have miraculous births (e.g., of Baranugan who was a grown man as soon as he was born and could fight even while his umbilical cord was yet uncut), no real death (e.g., the warriors who die in the Tuwaang and Lumabat tales are quickly resurrected), trans? formations, and a host of other magical happen? ings. It is a curious world of the human and the transhuman; with the gods in creative ferment, and the natural order and the human condition already in the process of becoming. It is to this condition that Jacobs refers in his remark that the earth in the mythic era was "in various conditions of incompleteness" (1959: 195 196). This incompleteness can be understood if we conceive creation as a sequence of creative moments, the "various and sometimes dramatic irruptions of the sacred into the world" (Eliade 1959:97). If we take this as the reality that myth imi? tates, we can see the explanation for many of the stylistic characteristics of myth and of its degenerate forms and versions. The mythic reality has the following features relevant to literary style: it is discontinuous and incom? plete; it is constituted of mixed forms, for part of this reality is, as it were, still rooted in a vague half-realized primal existence whereas another part already tends towards the present order as we know it; and for this reason, too, space and time are neither homogeneous nor continuous, for the sacred and the profane are already intersecting. (Re concepts of space and time, see Eliade 1959:68). The above-mentioned features are expressed in the style of the myth. The discontinuity is reflected in segmented plots where certain</page><page sequence="8">208 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY areas stand brightly illumined while others recede into invisibility in the background. In this respect, it is reminiscent of the Old Testa? ment style in which "the decisive points of the narrative alone are emphasized, what lies bet? ween is non-existent" (Auerbach 1957:9). This discontinuity can be justified if we see myth as a dramatization of creative moments. Focus on such moments will necessarily bring some parts into high relief and relegate others to in? visibility. The same discontinuity is expressed in the often uneasy coexistence of the natural and the supernatural, the historic and the mythic dimensions of experience. Hence, we have the tension between details of the sensory woiid and everyday life (betel-nut chewing, preparing for a journey, and others), on one hand, and the portrayal of magical happenings in a sus? pended space-time dimension, on the other. This, it appears, has its roots in the tension bet? ween the sacred and the profane characteristics of both mythic and historic realities in view of the fact that the natural is projected in literary and religious representations into the super? natural and vice versa. Consequently, mythic narratives are often characterized by an unin tegrated juxtaposition of two varieties of ex? perience, the sacred and the profane. Furthermore, focus on the creative acts of the culture-hero, acts set where boundaries in space and time are not clearly delineated, pushes many things to the periphery. Hence, secondary characters, like the followers, the country lasses, and the watchman in the Manuvu epic, remain a peripheral, half-realized presence in the narrative. It is then in the character of the mythic reality itself that one finds a central explanation for the discontinuous character of the mythic plot. It must be pointed out, though, by way of extension and clarification to this argument, that certain discontinuities of the plot can also be explained as conditioned by acculturation, the revisions, additions and deletions the mythic plot undergoes as it moves along the line from expression to application (Jensen's "process of semantic depletion", 1963:4-6), by which pro? cess it acquired new content, new style, and new functions, without completely casting away the old. Hence, the discontinuity may also be related to the text's hybrid quality. We see this illustrated in comparing the relatively "purer" Manuvu epic with the more adulterated Sulod narrative: in the clearer segmentary character of the former as contrasted to the fuller, more naturalistic portrayals of the latter. We also see this in what appears to be an over? lay of superfluous metaphors in the Manuvu epic (cited on p. 204-5), which reenforce the discontinuity between the natural and super? natural worlds. But even as these points are taken into account, I think we can still safely posit that this discontinuous quality is germane to the mythic plot. After all, we must note that in the process of semantic depletion, there can be no sharp and complete break between expression and application. The marking of specific gra? dations in this transition (which would be necessary if one where to assign specific motifs and traits to equally specific sources and con? ditioning factors) would be significant, but this lies outside the aims of this paper. In considering the mythic style, another factor will have to be taken into account: the function of myth. Here, it is again instructive to turn to Eliade and Jensen. Both refer to the desire of "religious man" to be, to participate in reality, to be saturated with power (Eliade 1959:13). "Religious man" satisfies this desire in rites where he enters into "sacred time" by commemorating the primal past, chanting and acting out his myths. Thus, Jensen says that the recitation of a myth may be "an act of a pronounced cultic nature". (1963:40) Through myth man can enter into sacred time, partici? pate in the true reality and "be saturated with power." The recital of myth, because of its sacred or cultic function, cannot be done with? out regard for time and place. This recital of creation in myth is a "re-actualization" of creation. This re-actualization is periodic: man must always imitate the paradigmatic gestures of the gods, repeat their actions, for (1) by imitating the gods, man remains in the sacred, hence in reality; and (2) by the continuous re actualization of paradigmatic divine gestures,</page><page sequence="9">Mojares / MYTHIC STYLE 209 the world is sanctified (Eliade 1959: 98-99). This function of myth is suggested for both Manuvu and Sulod epics. Jocano notes that the Hinilawod is associated with a number of Sulod rituals; that a number of "sacred passages" are used only in special rites; that the bard is conscious of a relationship with the super? natural established through these passages (1967:305). In the case of the Manuvu epic, we cited Benedict (1916) and Raats (1969) who suggest an original religious matrix to the Tuwaang cycle: in the blood-sacrifice and rites which "repeated" the primordial slaying which marked the beginning of historical time and mortal life. The function of myth outlined above has a number of implications for the mythic style. We discussed earlier (pp. 202) repetitiveness of action and language as a distinctive feature of the mythic style. The relationship of this feature to the function of myth is obvious. Imitation, and with it repetition, is basic to the religious or cultic experience (Eliade 1959: 98-99) for it is in the imitation of the gods and the repetition of their acts that both man and the world are sanctified. Hence, we have the rites, ceremonials, and myths which imitate and periodically repeat the creative activity of the deities. It is not only the rite as a whole which is repeated but each of its parts has to be re-enacted. Here, emphasis is placed on the correct and meticulous observance of elaborate, cyclic and repetitive ritual patterns and tech? niques. The repetitive character of myth finds its natural expression in the style of mythic narratives. We see this in the pattern of the action itself, in the repetitive adventures of the culture-hero or dema-deity. We see this in the recurrence of rituals in such narratives and in the pattern of recurrence in the ritual itself. We see this in the ritualistic language in which certain words, phrases, and passages are con? stantly repeated. That this kind of repetition is germane to the cultic activity can be pro? fusely illustrated even in today's invocations, hymns, and prayers. The repetition is an ex? pression of renewal, and only the continuity of renewal guarantees for the religious man a life in the real. But the function of myth, like its design and content, does not remain fixed. We see this in the narratives under study. Both Manuel and Jocano note that the epics, for the modern Sulod and Manuvu, are now used for entertainment and the more obvious applications of social in? doctrination. With these shifts of function, we note corollary contentual and stylistic changes. In the Sulod epic, the event of primal murder is displaced in importance by Labaw Donggon's romantic adventures. In the Manuvu epic, a romantic motif is also made to stand as the main thread of the plot. Even while this is so, it is perhaps a testament to the unity of human experience that the reader still notes in these latter-day texts the persistence of the original stylistic and ideological configurations of myth. Conclusions We have isolated and analyzed in this paper two stylistic features shared by The Maiden of the Buhong Sky and The Epic of Labaw Dong gon: the obtrusive and obsessive use of repe? tition and the discontinuous character of action, time and space in these narratives. In explaining these features, we presented the argument that the style of these narratives is a natural extension or expression of basic features of the mythic ideology itself. Hence, the use of the description "mythic style". The discussion has not been as exhaustive or exact as I would have liked to make it; for this reason, its conclusions can only be tentative. This paper only aims to explore and suggest a perspective in which stylistic features of oral literature can be more fruitfully and justly evaluated, a perspective based on the recog? nition of the organic relationship of form and content in literature. It is hoped that more thoroughgoing and conclusive studies can be effected on this basis.</page><page sequence="10">210 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY SOURCES Auerbach, Erich 1957 Mimesis; the representation of reality in Western literature.
