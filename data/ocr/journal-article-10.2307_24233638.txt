<plain_text><page sequence="1">Raphael Shuchat Maimonides' Theology and the Place and Limits of Human Reason: A Discussion of Maimonides' Thinking and a Comparison with the Zemah Zedek A Rationalist is one who sees human reason as the measurement of all. Therefore, the religious rationalist must live with both revelation and reason equally without compromise. But can these lines meet? What is the place of human reason in understanding revelation? If the religious rationalist uses reason as a filter through which he understands revelation can he go a step further and infer revelation through reason? Can the same logical system of the Halakhists who derive new legal decisions through inference based on the principles of the halakhic system, exist in areas of faith? The goal of this essay is to examine the role of reason in Maimonides' writings in the area of beliefs. I will argue not only that Maimonides puts revelation and reason on equal status, but that reason can actually deduce articles of faith. I will demonstrate, that for Maimonides, this belief is so strong that if a principle of faith reached by reason contradicts a dictum of the oral tradition, the latter must be re-interpreted. My example will be Maimonides' understanding of the role of human free will as a dictate of reason. I will examine as well the limits of reason in Maimonides' thinking in contrast to Hassidism both in the question of the universality of human knowledge as well as in the question of Devekut. In addition, I will examine how Maimonides sees the essence of belief itself as a rational dictate in contrast to Hasidism. In the end I will come full circle to explain that for Maimonides, an additional reason why faith must be a rational dictate and why it is imperative to allow the maximum arena for human reason in understanding DAAT 64-66, 2009</page><page sequence="2">XXXVIII Raphael Shuchat beliefs, is due to his understanding that the human mind is ultimately a vehicle for unio mystica therefore acting as a means both for reason and revelation. Already in 1979, S. Pines discussed the question of the limits of human reason in Maimonides' writings, comparing his position to that of Al-Farabi and ibn Bajja. Pines described Maimonides' position as "the opinion that no scientific certainty can be achieved with regard to objects that are outside the sublunar world".1 It therefore goes without mention that Man can have no real knowledge of God. Rambam states this himself, if we understand Aristotle as Rambam's paradigm for human understanding: Everything that Aristotle has said about all that exists from beneath the sphere of the moon to the center of the earth is indubitably correct, and no one will deviate from it unless he does not understand it or unless he has preconceived opinions that he wishes to defend or that lead him to a denial of a thing that is manifest. On the other hand, everything that Aristotle expounds with regard to the sphere of the moon and that which is above it is, except for certain things, something analogous to guessing and conjuring.2 The only understanding one can achieve of God is "negative knowledge of Him, and he can know his attributes of action, that is, he can grasp the natural phenomena and their causes."3 Even the prophets, who seemed to have a cognizance of higher realms, experienced mere "lightening flashes", like Avicenna's experiences of arufun, or the sufi term awqat, that flash momentarily and are subsequently extinguished.4 D. Schwartz points out that for Maimonides, the attempt to focus on issues beyond the limit of human knowledge can be detrimental to the philosophic process.5 Pines went as far as arguing that Maimonides rejected the possibility of any non-empirical scientific knowledge including the 'possibility of metaphysical knowledge in the sense of knowledge of the incorporeal realm'.6 Rambam, accordingly, became a sort of forerunner of Kant. However, this being the case, one may ask, what is the point of Maimonides' discussion of negative Divine attributes, if we can only have knowledge of His existence and not His essence? This is a fundamental inquiry. Can anything positive be said about God? Rambam in 1: 53-54 assures us that this S.

Therefore, all the Divine attributes perceived via negativa are just tautologies stating that God is God.7 Even unity and existence cannot be seen as attributes since they are inseparable from His essence.8 Crescas, early on, picked up on this seeming contradiction in Rambam, for if you say that God has no attributes but you make negative deductions, you are de facto making positive statements. Rambam seems even to over step his own limits by affirming God's will, power and knowledge.9 Guttman tried to solve this problem by stating that these attributes are undetermined. Furthermore, he took the stance that the theory of attributes is part of Maimonides' theory of Knowledge in addition to his theology.10 For Rambam, as with the neo-platonists, God remains incomprehensible and mysterious.11 Wolfson, taking up Crescas' argument, stated: But here a question must have arisen in the mind of Maimonides. The very law of the excluded middle which makes every proposition "a" is "b" imply "a is not not-b" also makes every proposition "a is not not-b" imply that "a" is "b". Consequently, if we object to the affirmation of a "habit" of God, we cannot justify such an affirmation by saying that it means the negation of its opposite privation, for the negation of the privation reciprocally means the affirmation of its opposite habit.12 Wolfson tried to answer this by saying that the implied negative attribute is not a regular affirmation for we do not know what God's knowledge or power really is: Now since every affirmative proposition about God , such, for instance, as "God is powerful" is to be understood as meaning not a "privation" but rather a "negation", namely "God is not weak", it follows that the negation of weakness in such a proposition does not necessarily imply its opposite power, in its ordinary sense as the opposite of weakness, is indirectly predicated to God.13 Therefore, Maimonides differs from Aristotle in the sense that we can make an J.

Guttmann argued that Rambam's concept of negative theology is on the one hand neoplatonic in our inability to comprehend God, but on the other hand, even though we exalt God above knowledge we negate ignorance in God.

"You come nearer to the apprehension of Him, may He be exalted, with every increase in the negations regarding Him."16 This means that the theory of negative attributes gives us a partial apprehension of the Divine essence which is different than knowing God. The former is obligatory for those capable of it, and the latter is impossible.17 This seems to be the simple understanding of negative theology.18 Rambam calls the 'description' of God through negation a correct description not in the sense of substance or accidents, but "in order to conduct the mind toward that which must be believed with regard to him."19 This is not empty knowledge, but a way to draw near to an idea beyond human comprehension.20 Some recent scholars tend to see the intellectual apprehension of God through negative theology, according to Rambam, as a vehicle of intellectual 'devekut'. R. Birnbaum, limits the human intellectual capacity in Maimonides' thought claiming that not only is intellectual knowledge the lot of the select few but "in Maimonides' Aristotelian system, man is inferior in rank to the heavenly bodies, which are endowed with intelligence superior to him. Accordingly, his intellect is insufficient to comprehend the superlunary world."21 However, she points out that for Maimonides, "the intellect is the distinct faculty which links man to God, and man is rewarded and Buföfcäüaci), pHnttipp. Ä2SuWhiari8 ponjÄ^amröfiltolfifofflfciioigyiMepröpdtafcikinfephd 64 utoteiSfb In his: "Crescas on the Problem of Divine Attributes", JQR VII (1916-17), pp. 1-44, and pp. 175-221.

Ivri, continues Pines' line and quotes J. Stern, who wrote that, "Maimonides has a negative view concerning the ability of internal speech to apprehend the true nature of immaterial entities like the separate intelligences of the heavens and God."23 Ivri admits that "the nature of God's existence, so described, is beyond our comprehension ...We are left with the knowledge of God as a causal principle."24 Normally a distinction is drawn between God's existence, which can be known and proven, and God's essence which cannot be known. However Ivri argues that this ignores "the fact that the very concept of God as necessary existence obliterates this distinction ... There is no scientific grounds to claim that there is a divine essence in addition to and different from its existence." He adds: Professors Pines and Stern are right, therefore, in believing Maimonides felt we have no knowledge of God beyond the fact the He does exist; or, more accurately, that He is the very essence of existence. They are wrong in believing this knowledge is not about God's essence, for his existence is His very essence ... he [Maimonides] knew as well that he knew more of God's essence than he cared to admit.25 Both Birnbaum and Ivri point out that there is more to human understanding of the supra natural than just negation. Z. Harvey, points out that just like Averroes, Maimonides sees the use of intellectual philosophical contemplation as a religious duty. It is the fulfillment of the commandment to "love" God26 and a means to knowledge of the Divine.27 This ties in well with Manekin's approach mentioned above that knowledge of God plays a central role in Maimonidean thought, even if it is not through knowing God directly, because: "through knowledge man becomes truly man."28 From the discussion above it is clear that for Maimonides, the faculty of reason brings one closer to God both intellectually, as a process of understanding as well as existentially in which the intellect becomes a vehicle to perform a religious duty. We will return to this discussion at the end of this essay. I would like to proceed with caution but continue this line of thought to understand what the limits of human reason are for Rambam.

The Place of Human Reason in Revelation In an introduction to the third part of the Guide, before discussing the secrets of the chariot and metaphysical knowledge, Rambam writes: No divine revelation has come to me to teach me that the intention in the matter in question was such and such, nor did I receive what I believe in these matters from a teacher. But the texts of the prophetic books and the dicta of the Sages, together with the speculative premises that I possess, showed me that things are undoubtedly so and so.29 It has been said that this statement is a reflection of Rambam's modesty.30 Even if there is some degree of modesty in this paragraph31 the main point is that Rambam is endowing a legitimacy to the faculty of human reason in understanding revelation. Despite not being a direct recipient of that revelation one can say of what "has appeared to me as [intellectually] clear" that if I withhold it from another, I am "robbing one who deserves the truth of the truth, or begrudging an heir his inheritance."32 This is a particularly strong claim: that one can deduce the secrets of a past revelation through human reason and call these new understandings objective 'truths', as well as even claim that they are part of the 'inheritance' of this original revelation. Rambam sees human reason as a legitimate interpreter of Divine revelation. This means, that even if human reason may be limited, with the aid of Divine revelation it can comprehend higher vistas of knowledge, which was the purpose of these revelations; to give the human mind the tools to reach those heights. Here Rambam takes a bold stance, which runs contrary to other religious philosophic standpoints. Aquinas, for instance, sees reason as subservient to faith and theology. Consequently, theology does not need metaphysics because simple faith encompasses all of truth.33 To the contrary, Rambam goes so far as to make human reason the legitimate partner of all revelation. In a similar passage to the one from the Guide above, he writes: Guide, III, introduction, p. 416 in Pines' translation. A. Wallman, "Mi-Emunah le-Emunah beDerekh haTvuna", Iyyun 35 (1986), p. 220.

No revelation from God has come to teach me that they are parables. Nor did I find any rabbinic tradition derived from the prophets in which they say categorically that these matters are allegorical. I will only explain to you what impels me to speak this way. My endeavor, and that of the select keen-minded people, differ from the quest of the masses. They like nothing better and, in their silliness, enjoy nothing more, then to set the law and reason at opposite ends, and to move everything from being explicable. So they claim it to be a miracle, and they shrink from identifying it as a natural accident... but I try to reconcile the law and reason, and whenever possible consider all things as of the natural order.35 Rambam explains that human reason can be a tool to better understand revelation. This tool was given to a select few enabling them to understand the meaning of the revelation. In his introduction to Helek, Rambam calls those select few who understand the metaphoric statements of the sages as belonging to an exclusive group; "so few that it is impossible to call them a group."36 This group consists of those who can differentiate between the logically possible and impossible and understand that it is the way of the wise to speak in riddles, as Solomon said: "To understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles" (Proverbs 1; 6).37 These are the same select few who can understand the secrets of metaphysics.38 Despite the fact the Rambam is discussing the writings of the Talmudic and midrashic sages he does not confine his argument for allegoric language to this period and argues that the Biblical texts are full of the use of such means. He points out that not only did Solomon use allegories in Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Eclessiastes, but so did the Book of Chronicles (1; 11; 22) and the Prophet Ezekiel in the vision of the dry bones (Chap. 37).39 For Rambam, the use of metaphors to interpret the Bible is nothing new. Most of the first part of the Guide was written to explain the anthropomorphic language of the bible. However, it is interesting to see how according to Rambam, the Bible itself uses allegorical language in obvious ways as well as non-obvious ones. This adds to the legitimacy I used this translation but I find it faulty. Rambam means that the text does not force such an unequivocal explanation but logic does.

Now, if we say that the Bible intentionally included metaphors, this means that the Bible expected the human reader to use their faculty of reason to understand what it left out. Here we arrive again at Rambam's position stated above concerning the place of reason in revelation. So strong is Rambam's belief in the role of reason in revelation that he is willing to admit that even the first premise of the Bible, that God created the world, could have been understood as a metaphor if necessary: Know that our shunning the affirmation of the eternity of the world is not due to a text figuring in the Torah according to which the world has been produced in time. For the texts indicating the world has been created are not more numerous than those indicating that the deity has a body. Nor are the gates of figurative interpretation shut in our faces or impossible of access to us regarding the subject of the creation of the world in time. For we could interpret them as figurative, as we have done when denying His corporeality ... Two causes are responsible for our not doing this or believing it ... That the deity is not a body has been demonstrated ... however the eternity of the world has not been demonstrated ... The second cause is as follows. That the deity is not a body destroys for us none of the foundations of the Law and does not give the lie to the claim of the prophets ... On the other hand, the belief in the eternity the way Aristotle sees it ... destroys the law in its principle.40 Here Rambam explains the place of reason in revelation. Revelation cannot contradict reason, nor can reason uproot a tradition if it's contradiction to reason has been openly recognized placing it in the realm of the miraculous. In the arena of conflict between reason and scripture, one must first check to see if the theory has been demonstrated and whether the understanding of the scripture is correct. Only after such an endeavor does one seek further to attempt synthesis. Rambam is totally committed to reason and revelation and does not hold one above the other as far as the search for truth is concerned. Reason plays an inherent role in understanding revelation as we pointed out above. In fact, reason can also determine a principle of the Torah even if that principle was not stated openly. The best example of this is Rambam's discussion of free will. The Issue of Free will Rambam summarizes his stance on human free will in his Mishneh Torah. "Free will is granted to all men. If one desires to turn himself to the path of good and 40 Guide II; 25. pp. 327-327 in Pines' translation.</page><page sequence="9">Maimonides' Theology and the Place and Limits of Human Reason XLV be righteous, the choice is his. Should he desire to turn to the path of evil and be wicked the choice is his."41 Rambam describes this concept as a fundamental to Jewish belief. This principle is a fundamental concept and a pillar [on which rests the totality] of the Torah and mizvot as [Deut. 30: 15] states: Behold I have set before you today life [and good, death and evil]. Similarly, [Deut. 11: 16] states , Behold I have set before you today [the blessing and curse], implying that the choice is in your hands."42 Rambam states that this is a fundamental principle and the pillar upon which rests the Torah and mizvot. That is quite a strong statement. From where does Rambam derive this principle? It's true that the verses chosen imply human free will but they do not state it openly. The proof is what Rambam states later in this chapter, that if there were not human free will then what would be the point of the prophets telling us to better our ways and what would be the point of the mizvot in the first place?43 Again this is an inferred argument from the text and not a direct quote. In fact, in his introduction to Avot, Rambam goes beyond religious argumentation and wonders what the point would be of any study; theoretical or practical, any judiciary system or any human endeavor, without human free will.44 In his Guide, Rambam writes similarly that free will: "is a fundamental principle of the law of Moses our Master, peace be on him, and of all those who follow it that man has an absolute ability to act."45 But he reveals his real conviction when he writes: There are many things whose existence is manifest and obvious ... and in fact they would require no proof... such are the existence of motion, of man's free will, of phases of production and destruction, and of the natural properties perceived by the senses.46 For Rambam, free will is a "non-issue", an axiom as obvious as the perception of the senses. Those who deny its' reality, are simply involved in imaginative discussion: "Philosophers are thus required to establish by proof things which are self evident, and to disprove the existence of things which only exist in man's imagination."47 Sefer Hamada, hilkhot teshuva 5; I.E.

Guide Ibid. Here, Rambam goes on to compare the self evident character of free will to the understanding that Divine attributes are not an essential part of God. We will return to this idea later.</page><page sequence="10">XLVI Raphael Shuchat It is true that free will is universally accepted by Jewish scholars but not without differing opinions concerning its scope.48 Whereas Rambam writes: "This is a fundamental principle about which — praise be to God — no disagreement has ever been heard within our religious community."49 Now, you might counter by saying that the biblical text does imply human free will and this is quite obvious from rabbinic sources as well. However, we shall now demonstrate that Rambam sees not only free will as being fundamental to Judaism but specifically total free will, making any Rabbinic or Geonic source to the contrary illegitimate. In his epistle to Ovadiah the Proselyte,50 Rambam discusses the issue of free will. "All which you have stated that human action is not decreed from above — is a truth without a blemish."51 Ovadiah asks Rambam for his reaction to the Rabbinic sources which seem to limit human free will. The first is from the Talmud, "All is in the hands of heaven except for the fear of heaven."52 Rambam skillfully solves the problem by explaining that all human action is related to the term "fear of heaven" and all non-human activities are in the hand of heaven.53 However, despite his manifest ability in rabbinic exegesis Rambam feels the need to state a general rule: We have already explained this issue [that humans have total free will] in our commentary on the Ethics of the Fathers as well as in the beginning of our major work which we wrote on the mizvot.54 And whoever leaves these clear ideas, based on eternal foundations, and goes off to look for in the Aggadah or midrash or in the writings of the Geonim, to find some idea that might at first glance ['al peshatah'] contradict our words which are those of reason and knowledge — is committing [spiritual] suicide, and it's enough the [punishment] he has brought upon himself.55 Rambam is stating a fundamental rule in establishing the connection between reason and revelation. Reason is so inherently related to revelation that its deductions take precedent over post-biblical Rabbinic sources. In this instance, if an idea is logically clear, like free will, which is a logical deduction from scripture, then it takes Compare for instance, Rambam, Hilkhot teshuva 5 : 4 and Gersonides, Milhamot Hashem.

In trying to understand the rabbinic concept that marriages are made in heaven, an idea limiting human free will, Rambam argues that this is only true in exceptional cases and is not a general principle.57 In summary, we see that for Rambam, the idea of total human free will is fundamental to Jewish belief despite the fact that its true basis is inferred from biblical text and is not a clear dictum. His argument for reason in revelation is so strong, that he is even unwilling to compromise this issue in favor of the simple meaning of rabbinic or geonic texts. As stated above, the idea of reason as an interpreter of revelation is essential to Rambam's thinking. Through reason he feels that he has an understanding of the secrets of Torah. "My knowledge of them [the mystic passages of the Torah] is based on reasoning, not divine inspiration."58 This does not stop Rambam from feeling that he has the true understanding of these passages: "But if, on the other hand, I were to abstain from writing on this subject, according to my knowledge of it... I would then be guilty of withholding the truth from those to whom it ought to be communicated."59 The Metaphysical Meaning of Human Intellect Now that we have seen what an essential role Rambam gives to reason in the comprehension of revelation, we can understand that reason is the legitimate companion of revelation, both being Divine creations given to man. To understand the deeper meaning of the intellect in Rambam's writings, we need to go back to the beginning of the Guide where Rambam argues that human reason is what the Bible is referring to when it says that Man was created in the image of God: As man's distinction consists in a property which no other creature on earth possesses, viz., intellectual perception, in the exercise of which he does not employ his senses, nor move his hand or his foot, this perception has been In the epistle, Rambam brings an argument from scripture, from the exemption the torah gives to the newly engaged to go home from the battlefield to demonstrate that free will is a biblical dictum. However, it is obvious that Rambam does not base the prevalence of free will on this biblical source alone, for just as he reinterpreted the corporeal features of God stated in the Bible, so too could he have done so in this case if reason had so dictated. Ibid. p. 237. Rambam attempts to reinterpret the passage in Moed Katan 18 b. However, he does not mention how he would interpret the claim that business transactions are made in heaven. Even the argument countering marriages made in heaven that he brings from "less another man should marry her" was asked by the Talmud and resolved differently than Rambam's interpretation. See as well the previous note. Guide III: introduction. Guide Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">XLVIII Raphael Shuchat compared — though only apparently, not in truth — to the Divine perception which requires no corporeal organ.60 The human intellect for Rambam is the divine gift to man. Not only does it separate him from the animals, but it also creates a bond between Man and God. This follows well from our discussion above where we explained that the faculty of reason can act as a means towards devekut and can fulfill a religious duty of knowing God.61 The intellect is also Man's link to the upper spheres. Rambam adopts Aristotles theory, developed by Arab scholars like Al-Farabi, that the spheres are endowed with intellect and forever yearn for the living God.62 This theory describes ten celestial intelligences, the lowest being the active intellect being associated with the lunar sphere. Despite how primitive this might sound to the ears of a modern astronomer, there is a message here. Man, in his intellect, is compared to these lofty spiritual beings endowed with intelligence. Rambam goes on to show that scripture can be understood according to this explanation. He asserts that the angels mentioned in scripture are identical with these intelligences.63 Rambam does not state directly that the first cause thinks itself64 but this can be inferred from his statement: "He and the things comprehended are one and the same thing, that is to say, His essence".65 My point here is not to discuss the theory of neo-Aristotelian astronomy, but to show how it connects to Rambam's understanding of human reason. Man's reason is, accordingly, part of a larger order of things. It's true that his reason is limited and cannot comprehend that of the intelligences above him, but he is on the same scale as they, even if at a lower rung. This is a world view which sees spirituality as a form of intellect. Therefore, human intellect is the connection to the spiritual world. Even God is seen as having His intelligence as equal to his essence. This is difficult in light of Rambam's theory of negative theology,66 but again shows the centrality of the intellect in the spiritual order of things. It is therefore, no surprise to find that for Rambam the commandment of belief is to Guide I: 1. Freidlander trans. Above note 21 and 26. Guide II: 3-4. Rambam admits that this theory includes unproven assertions but sees it preferable to other theories of his time being more systematic.

This is a point I hope to expand on in another essay. Let it suffice by saying that by making one's belief intellectual, one shows "a desire to rise to a higher state, viz., that of reflection."68 This is where the theory of negative attributes comes in. I agree with the view that Rambam is trying to teach a way of affirming God through the negative theology. Rambam points this out clearly: The following question might be asked: Since there is no possibility of obtaining a knowledge of the true essence of God, and since it has also been proved that the only thing that man can apprehend of Him is the fact that He exists, and that all positive attributes are inadmissible, as has been shown; what is the difference among those who obtained a knowledge of God?69 Rambam argues that each negation of what God is not, brings one closer to some form of understanding of Him. He illustrates this out by way of example: A person may know for certain that a 'ship' is in existence, but he may not know to what object that name is applied, whether to a substance or to n accident, a second person then learns that the ship is not an accident; a third that that it is not a mineral; a fourth that is not a plant growing in the earth; a fifth, that is is not a body whose parts are joined together by nature; a sixth, that it is not a fat object... a seventh that it is not a sphere ... a tenth that is not a solid. It is clear that this tenth person has almost arrived at the correct notion of a 'ship' by the foregoing negative attributes.70 Despite the difficulty in applying this example to God, since we have no framework of reference in talking of God, Rambam sees his negative theology as one that gives one a true knowledge of God, by getting closer and closer to the idea, even if we never actually reach our goal. This is the first task of the intellectual theological perception for Rambam. However, aside from this first task, the philosophical one, the is a second task for the intellect, a more mystical one, whereby the intellect, being of divine substance, as if, is the connection between, man and god.71 This connection is activated by contemplating the Divine. Rambam explains this in a chapter which he describes as a conclusion of his treatise.72 I have shown you that the intellect which emanates from God unto us is the link that joins us to God. You have it in your power to strengthen that bond, if Book of Knowledge, Yesodei haTorah, 1; 6. Guide I: 50. Guide I: 59. Guide I: 60. See D.

It will only be strong when you employ it in the love of God, and seek that love; it will be weakened when you direct your thoughts to other things.73 Rambam goes on to explain how to reach this level of contemplation. It is not without reason that this chapter is the conclusion of his book. It is the basis of Rambam's thinking. Not only is human reason a vehicle to understand the world and God's existence but also a means of linking oneself to God. There is nothing above intellect except higher levels of intelligence. Therefore, in a certain way, it is that same intellect that ties man to God, and it is that same intellect which enables man to think or philosophize about God. For after all, if there is no coordinate that can link my thought to God, how can I think even about His existence? How can I say anything at all about God? For if I am to say for instance that knowledge is a totally human characteristic and that there are levels above it, than what assurance do I have that I can understand anything spiritual at all? Secondly, if God is absolute reality and if God is totally removed from my perception, would that mean that even what I perceive to be true about my world may be wrong from an absolute point of view? If the answer to this is affirmative, then what is the value of what I have perceived seeing that it is not universally true. Rambam as a rationalist assures us that this cannot be. "We cannot ascribe to God the power of doing what is impossible."74 and therefore what we perceive as true in this world is universally true. Using this Aristotelian concept of the impossible,75 Rambam ascribes to the Kalam, the view that God can do the impossible, albeit with some reservations which he describes. He lists as well those issues upon which the Kalam disagree. The Kalam believe that anything imaginable is theoretically possible76 However they do admit that what is not imaginable and logically inadmissible is also impossible for God.77 While he differs openly with the Kalam, Rambam admits that he holds one disagreement with the philosophers on this point; i.e. that he assumes creation ex nihilo possible at least for God and they disagree.78 This is a major query. If God cannot do the logically Guide Ibid. Guide III: 15. Aristotle, Physics VI, 10, 241b, 4-8. See Guide I: 73, the tenth assumption. See also Shemonah Perakim, chapter one. See H.

Maimonides 'Theory of Teleology and the Divine Attributes, Tarbiz 1,4 (1930), p. 117 note 6. A.

Possibly Rambam did not see this as something</page><page sequence="15">Maimonides' Theology and the Place and Limits of Human Reason LI impossible then what is a miracle?79 Is the concept of miracle part of Rambam's statement that creation ex nihilo is an exception to the rule? Is that why he lumps all the miracles into the sixth day of creation just before nightfall? Or is the miraculous an anomaly of nature that God created to be part of nature therefore giving it a sort of logical status?80 Joseph Albo tried to answer this problem by differentiating between things logically and innately impossible which cannot change, and things that are impossible due to the laws of nature and therefore are subject to a miracle.81 The issues here are abundant and were discussed by numerous philosophers of the middle ages.82 What about the theoretical issues here? If God's knowledge and our knowledge are only homonyms and are essentially different, could God know a reality where 1 and 1 are 3? Could God see that in our reality? Rambam must answer in the negative. First of all because that would mean that logic is not universal, which is the basis of rationalism. We can say that God knows things that we do not, but to say that what we know for certain God knows differently, is to take away the basis of human knowledge by making our understanding subjective. Secondly, we explained that there is an order of intelligences. While we are on the lowest rung, we still are connected so that what we do know is real knowledge. This would imply that it is not so? Therefore, this would not only take away the ground on which rationalist thinking is based, but also diminish the congruity of human reason with the metaphysical world an make real intellectual devekut impossible. The Kabbalistic Approach The Rashba [R. Shlomo Ben Abraham Adret 1235-1310] was one of the first to argue with Rambam on the scope of Divine knowledge. It should be noted, that even one with a superficial knowledge of kabbalah would realize that for the Kabbalists intelligence is neither the highest point of the human being nor of the cosmos. After all, isn't Keter higher than Hokhmahl Therefore we need to understand that the issue at hand is more essential than just the place of logical inquiry in theology. Rashba in a famous letter concerning the negative influence of philosophic Judaism on the masses, addressed what he perceived to be the major causes of confusion in Jewish thought. One of them was this issue of God's ability to enact the impossible. notable since it does not include a physical interaction with our world or change in the range of perceived logic but just an argument for an additional ability in God's knowledge. See Reines, Ibid., pp. 260-262. Reines Ibid, reached a different conclusion based on Strauss' concept of exoteric and esoteric Rambam. Sefer Ha-lkkarim, Part one, chapter 22.

They are for example: that God make another God like Himself or that He incarnate Himself or cause any change in Himself for we do not believe that the blessed God, can be described as capable of such thing as the great Rabbi [Maimonides], of blessed memory, wrote. Enumerated among these impossibilities are other necessary ideas [of faith] making it impossible to explain it all in writing.83 Despite the fact that the Rashba is close to Rambam's thinking in his argument against the Kalam,84 Rambam limits God's ability to perform the logically impossible to one instance, creation ex nihilo,85 whereas Rashba enumerates what impossibilities God cannot do, i.e. those items necessary for our belief, suggesting that all other humanly logical impossibilities are possible for Him. This seemingly slight argument is picked up and developed by Menahem Mendel Schneersohn (1798-1866), better know as the Zemah Zedek. In a treatise dealing with philosophic issues entitled Derekh Emunah, he quotes the Rashba's statement above and adds: "[concerning] this idea that the impossible have a steady nature ... does any one disagree that the Holy One Blessed Be He, master of wonders, can do any miracle or wonder even in areas that seem to us as impossibilities."86 He is willing to admit that in nature in general there are logical exclusions, but God can always perform miracles: Impossibilities have a steady nature if we say that Reuven is riding or not riding at the same time [which is humanly impossible] ... or to say that today is yesterday and tomorrow simultaneously, as seen there [in the Rashba's letter] but other impossibilities are not impossible for Him nay He be blessed, just as He created the world ex nihilo which is the greatest of wonders. The reason for this difference between the two types of impossibilities, is that the one they call having a steady nature is the one impossible for the created, because how could Reuven ride and not ride simultaneously. [However] this is not an impossibility for God but for the created ... Therefore we can say that generations of humans cannot extend into an eternal past; God alone is eternal.87 83 Shelot u-Teshuvot HaRashba, part one, letter 418, Jerusalem, 1997, vol. 1, p. 216.

Logical impossibilities are a human condition. There are certain things that we will call impossible for God for reasons of belief, but in general, there is no reason to limit God by human boundaries. If we extend this idea to the realm of logic, then this discussion has implications for the understanding of human logic. For if God can perceive our world differently, how can we know if logic is really universal outside our own perception? This type of thinking is every rationalist's nightmare. However, it is also a very different perception of God vis a vis creation than that of the rationalist. By way of illustration, I remember in my late teens taking a bus from Kiriat Malahkhi to Ashkelon. Two teens approached and asked me if I believed in God. Upon hearing an affirmative answer they proceeded by asking me if I believed that God was all-powerful. They then asked me if this God could create a stone which he could not lift. Being a devout rationalist at the time, I explained to them in accordance with the Guide III: 15, that logical limitations do not take away from God's perfection. Therefore, by answering in the negative to their question concerning such a stone, I was merely establishing that God could pick up everything for there is nothing he cannot pick up. Therefore, I claimed, it is illogical to imagine Him creating such a thing. Today, after reading Rashba and Menahem Mendel I would offer them a second explanation (if I could find them. At the time they seemed impressed that I was willing to offer an answer). Based on the assumption that God has no logical limitations, since he cannot be defined by human logic except for those which we need for our understanding of the tenets of faith, I would say: "Can God create a stone that he cannot pick up? Yes, and he can pick it up as well". You might point out the flawed human logic here but this is according to the opinion that there is no stable nature to impossibilities as far as God is concerned. Illustrations aside, this issue is not just a particular difference between Menahem Mendel and the Rambam confined to the discussion of logic. In his Derekh Mizvotekha, R. Menahem Mendel attacks Rambam directly for referring to God as a Being of intellectual essence. Following the lead of The Maharal of Prague, who claimed that it was a mistake to identify God with His knowledge, for His essence is beyond that,88 the Zemah Zedek wrote: "To explain their words [the Maharal and the Tosefot Yom Tov] they are differing with Rambam and his followers who said that His knowledge equals his essence and he is the knower, the knowledge and the known, since it was explained that His essence is much higher and exalted than any form of intellect. He is simple being; indefinable in any way. Therefore when God knows Himself, it is not through knowledge, heaven forbid, but [through a means] much higher than this. Therefore, there is no point or necessity to say that He is the knower and the knowledge etc. Only what God knows about His creation 88 Maharal, Gevurot Hashem, Jerusalem, 1971, Second introduction, p. 9.</page><page sequence="18">LIV Raphael Shuchat do we call knowledge, for this is how the Holy One Blessed Be He chose to know existence, through knowledge".89 This of course is a kabbalistic concept that the Ein Sof created the sefira of Hokhmah and through it created the world which shares in that Hokhmah. However, in contrast to Rambam, we have a different perspective on the Divine Being. God is neither knowledge, nor any type of intellect, but a simple existence beyond description. God created knowledge and all creatures share in this knowledge. Human beings share it in a cognizant way, whereas the rest of creation share in it incognito. Man can never have knowledge of God, for His essence is above comprehension. Therefore, one cannot speak of knowledge of God, as Rambam does, but only of belief in God. For Rambam, knowledge is above belief, but for Menahem Mendel, belief goes where knowledge cannot. This issue is how he starts his discussion, quoting Rambam who states that there is a Mizvah to know and believe in God.90 After bringing the famous query of Hasdai Crescas, who asks how there can be a command to believe in the commander, Menahem Mendel solves this logical problem by claiming that Rambam meant that 'knowledge' of God refers to the knowledge that God exists, which is logically obvious, since, after all, if we didn't create ourselves than who did?91 "What this means is that the command is to believe not in His existence; for that we do not need a command, for we already know that, but the command is to believe that He is of perfect existence."92 Da'at is the perception of His existence but not of His essence.93 Faith is concerning things we cannot perceive, "for faith is higher than the intellect".94 We therefore see that for R. Menahem Mendel, God is not intellect. God cannot be known through any intellectual exercise, neither can He be bound by any intellectual limitation. For Rambam this would be difficult not only philosophically but religiously too, for we pointed out that the intellect for Rambam, has also the task of devekut, that of binding the individual to God. However, for Menahem Mendel, even though he agrees that Man has to bind to God, this is not achieved through the intellect. The inner neshamah of Man is above intellect. It is Helek Eloha Mima'al, made, as if, from Divine 'stuff'. This soul is the connection between Man and God, having nothing to do with any intellectual capacity. This is not an anti-intellectual approach, as in the writings of R. Nahman of Braslav. It is an approach that values the intellectual quest but puts limits on its abilities. As a postscript it would seem that in a post-Kantian era, when even the existence Derekh Mizvotekha, New York, 1970, Mizvat Ha'amana Elakut, chapter 4, 47b. Sefer Hamizvot, Mizva 1.
