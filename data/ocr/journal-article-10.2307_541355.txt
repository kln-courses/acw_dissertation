<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Case of California. By Lawrence Rickels. (Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. Pp. ix + 373, pre- face, index) SUSAN RITCHIE Ohio State University Lawrence Rickels is no folklorist. The Case of California is not an ethnography of Cali- fornia. In fact, Rickels treats California not as a place, but as "California," a placeholder for various problematic moments in Freudian psychoanalysis, Frankfurt school critical the- ory, and poststructuralism. One could not even say that California is really just a state of mind. For Rickels, "California" is a side effect, an accidental, if symptomatic, inven- tion of modern critical thought. The Case of California provides a series of clips that race through the postmodern landscape, making any vestigial notions one might hold about actual people living in actual places seem for- ever quaint and impossibly naive. Of course Rickels has no ambition to be a folklorist, which is why his inclusion of enough intriguing social texts (the pictures of missing children on milk cartons, the dis- course of the anti-smoking movement, nar- ratives of religious conversion, the psychol- ogy of adolescent culture) to supply topics for all the dissertations in Indiana for a decade might give pause. For when Rickels writes that one of the accomplishments of his dis- course is to ensure that the cultural ephemera with which he is concerned "will not have been surrendered to journalism or the state" (p. 2), he seems blissfully unaware that there are disciplines that do take such cultural ar- tifacts and narratives as their object of study. Rickels, then, would be the last to suppose he has opened up a vista for folklore. Yet there is a great deal to feed on here for the folklorist interested in contemplating and perhaps extending the boundaries of the field. By treating psychoanalytic thought as the result of society-wide obsessions and cur- rents, Rickels has ingenuously (if unwit- tingly) invented psychoanalytic theory itself as a kind of modern lore. Psychoanalysis is an anonymous cultural invention (the same cultural current runs through Freud, Jung, and the California teenager on a mall crawl); psychoanalysis, like lore, is an inherited and necessary knowledge that both protects and invents its (post)modern society. The ramifications of understanding theory in this way have enormous and fascinating implications for folklore. It might be said, in fact, that Rickels uses the formulation of the- ory as lore to regard psychoanalysis not as a privileged metadiscourse, but as a discursive negotiation of cultural dynamics. That he himself is unaware of the discipline of folk-</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 111 lore is no reason to ignore his stimulating in- cursion into our field. One of Rickels's specific interests is in how German critical theorists such as Adorno worked their theory as a refusal of Nazism. The focus is a bold and difficult one, requir- ing that he make a connection between fas- cist Germany and California, a connection bound to be at least occasionally strained. The more fanciful versions of this link occur as Rickels suggests parallels between Califor- nia earthquakes and German history, when he writes, "The San Francisco earthquake of 1989 erected a wall in the place of a double bridge-to Germany, where another wall, the one separating unification of East and West, collapsed in the wake of the quake" (p. 220). But the basic premise, that of under- standing the connection between the Ger- man texts of modernism and their postmod- ern future as marked by California-as-phi- loseme, is both sound and interesting. As Rickels notes in a more modest statement, "If postmodernity is postmarked (like the re- pressed according to Freud) 'made in Ger- many' then California is its address and tech- no future" (p. 11). And the links Rickels establishes between the great German moderns, contemporary culture, death, sex, and theory (not necessar- ily in that order) are irresistible. Freud's con- tribution to the study of hysteria included the definition of a "conversion reaction" whereby hysterics would develop specific and symbolically important somatic symp- toms that would conveniently prevent en- gagement in the activities that cause psychic conflict. In Rickels's scheme, the Californian obsession with health and the human body would seem to be the conversion reaction of psychoanalysis itself. For Rickels's point is that California's surface projection of health and happiness is in fact the result of moder- nity's repression of what lies at its heart: Freud's death instinct. Yet I wonder if the conflicted activity that California's repression of the death instinct enables is not more than just aerobic class; namely, it seems to enable modern critical thought itself. Rickels himself vacillates be- tween seeing psychoanalytic theory as symp- tomatic of its cultural situation and as a tool of real enlightenment. His confusion is ap- parent in how he understands the sea-change German modernism underwent to become Californian postmodernism as a kind of di- minishment. What was a theory of mourn- ing in Freud becomes a practice of "haunt- ing" in Los Angeles as technology speeds up images to remove them further from reality and closer to simulacra (in this sense, Rickels picks up Adorno's and Benjamin's concern that California's most famous citizen, Mickey Mouse, represented the impossibil- ity of anthropomorphism-even for human beings-in technology). It is disappointing, though, that a thinker as sophisticated as Rickels would come around to blame this dialectic on that con- veniently evil monolith: the media. It is dis- appointing that Rickels would be so predict- able to discover-quelle surprise-that things are getting worse. One does wonder if a dose of folklore would not be in order here, to un- derstand the register of difference that exists between popular media culture and the folk- loric negotiations of the media enacted by California's youth culture. (Rickels, finally, cannot distinguish between the media and people who watch it, sometimes in creative ways.) And I do worry at the way in which Rickels invents all theory as psychoanalytic theory (one of the oddities of this book is the way in which it appropriates the Frankfurt School of critical theory for psychoanalysis without comment or explanation) and all psychoanalytic theory as California. To em- ploy Rickels's place-as-philoseme metaphor, I wonder if two spaces near to this reviewer, critical theory and the Midwest, are not thus reduced to intellectual wastelands. But perhaps I shouldn't wonder that Rick- els himself would become symptomatic of the system he describes. After all, he is well aware that in this post-Enlightenment cul- ture of invention, "invention is always the</page><page sequence="3">112 Journal of American Folklore 106 (1993) invention of oneself' (p. 337). And we can be forever grateful for this most excellent model of how our disciplines, our objects of study, and our social text are matters of mutual in- scription.</page></plain_text>
