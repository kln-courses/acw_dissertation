<plain_text><page sequence="1">HESIOD'S HAWK AND NIGHTINGALE (OP. 202-12): FABLE OR OMEN? In the Dinner of the Seven Wise Men Cleodorus the physician says that Aesop can more justly lay claim to being the pupil of Hesiod than the poet Epimenides (one of the candidates for a place on the list of sages) since the fable of the hawk and the nightingale (Op. 202-12) first suggested to Aesop the idea of this form of proverbial wisdom spoken by many tongues. From this passage it can be inferred that since antiquity Hesiod's hawk and nightingale has been hailed as the oldest surviving beast fable in Greek literature1. It is also the only acvos extant in Hesiod. This in itself is curious, since the didactic nature of 'The Works and Days' makes it receptive to parable, allegory, proverbial maxims, and other forms of wisdom literature from the Near East where the fable originated2. Is it a fable alone? Or is it something more? As a literary form fable, in fact, is quite fluid until the earliest extant collections, and fables are in any case difficult to define generically because of the diversity of materials on which they draw3. In Greek literature up through the classical period the fable is a flexible medium having affinities with other poetic 1 Plu. Mor. 158B; L. W. DALY, Hesiod's Fable, T.A.Ph.A. 92 (1961), 45. M. L.

BONA QUAGLLA, Gli Erga di Esiodo (Turin 1973), 131-141 surveys interpretations of the passage. The fable has been subsequently treated by F. R.

(For representative points of view on the question of Near Eastern influences on the fable in archaic Greek poetry in general, see La Fable, Fondation Hardt Entretiens, ed. 0. REVERDIN [Geneva 1984], 25-32). Various intepreters have compared the Hesiodic passage with Sumerian fables (e.g., C. Bradford WELLES, Hesiod's Attitude toward Labor, G.R.B.St. 8 [1967],19; West, 205). But in the rhetoric collections published by E. I. GORDON and others, birds are rarely subjects of what is discernably a fable. Talking birds, however, figure prominently in non-proverbial forms of Near Eastern wisdom literature, such as oracles and mythical narratives. A possible parallel is the conversation between the eagle and the vixen in the myth of Etana, which perhaps transformed into the partnership of the eagle and the fox in Archilochus fr. 174 West. 3 B. E. PERRY, Fable, Studium Generale 12 (1959), 18-20, stresses the importance of defining fable by its purpose, not by its material.

LONSDALE devices, including omens, similes, and parables; analysis of the eagle and lion imagery in the &gt;Agamemnon&lt;, for example, reveals that fable and other devices are often indistinguishable4. The &gt;&gt;or&lt; in the title of this paper is not meant to be disjunctive but rather conjunctive. I don't intend to argue that the passage at Op. 202-12 is either a fable or an omen, but influenced by both. Analysis of the text suggests that if it was adapted from a pre-existing fable, Hesiod has altered it to stunning effect in response to the demands of his narrative; comparison of the passage with epic contexts involving bird subjects shows Hesiod's creative response to traditional material5. That the passage could be read as both is not unlikely, since there are in effect two audiences. Although the poet says he will tell the aLvog for the kings, he in fact tells it to Perses, who, despite his ambitions, represents the bi4[og. I would suggest that to the kings the passage is a fable - a mere children's story, but to Perses and whoever else will harken to Hesiod's message, the passage carries a more ominous meaning. According to the so-called &gt;&gt;autobiographical&lt;&lt; interpretation of the passage argued by PUELMA, Pucci, and others the hawk represents the {UfeQL of the ja3cLXEL;, and the nightingale the voice of the poet6. Like the poet, the nightingale heroically resists a mightier aggressor. This interpretation complements PUELMA'S observation that the hawk's speech resembles the boasting words of Iliad warriors who have at their mercy a victim on the battlefield7. But in the Hesiodic passage the victim in effect turns tables on the assailant. The hunter becomes the hunted. As Pucci shows, the nightingale undergoes a metaphorical transformation into Dike, who as the informant of Zeus sings (y'Q'vrT', 260) to him about the unjust intention of men8. If the fable is conceived of as a narrative in which a conversion or change in status occurs between the two opposed characters, it is necessary to 4 ADRADOS, Historia de la fdbula, 204-16, discusses the overlap between fable and omens and similes.

The passage is not an independent, self-contained narrative with an internal con- version, but interacts thematically and linguistically with its place in the poem. This observation suggests that we are dealing with something more than a fable. The hawk and nightingale occurs towards the end of the first part of the poem, which is aimed at inculcating in Perses the principle of fair dealing and the import- ance of earning one's living. The poet strenghtens his naQaL'vEoLg to Perses and the paa3ckELg whith myth, parable, allusion, and the aLvog. The hawk and nightingale constitutes the fifth in a series of exempla to instruct Perses about justice. The other four - the'EQL&amp;Fg, Prometheus, Pandora, and the Myth of Ages - are mythologi- cal in content. As an illustration of the Iron Age the verses smoothe the transition between the final age (176-201) and a virtual golden age in the just community (225-237). The mythological context should alert us to the possibility of something other than fable influencing the passage. Still, there are several obvious features to commend the passage as a fable'0. The narrative is told in the past tense and involves talking animals. Moreover, the hawk and nightingale represent an antithetical pair, which is emphasized by the use of the masculine article for the predator and the feminine for his prey. One of the characters pronounces the moral". There is a further blurring of human and animal worlds in the use of anthropomorphic vocabulary, such as 6dinvov (209)12 for the hawk's potential meal, and &amp;oLb6g (cf. 208), which brings the song-bird closer to the poet13. At the same time the characters behave as animals. But there are also several departures from what characterizes a fable. Although the poet introduces his digression with the words &gt;&gt;Now I will tell a tale ... .&lt;&lt; the narrative itself has no prologue. It begins in medias res'4. There is no display of wit or 9 This criterion is applied to certain Near Eastern fables by R. S. FALKOWITZ, The Fable in Early Mesopotamian Literature, Fondation Hardt Entretiens 30 (Geneva 1984), 7. 10 It conforms to the narrative principles for fable (including narrative in the past tense, the principle of two characters, and the law of contrast) defined by M. N0JGAARD in La fable antique (Copenhagen 1964), I 186ff. 11 WEST 208 discusses objections since Aristarchus to the fact of the hawk's pronouncing the moral at Op. 210-11. But it is normal for the last character to pronounce the moral, cf. B. E. PERRY, The Origin of the Epimythium, T.A.Ph.A. 71 (1940), 403; but PERRY, ibid. 400, believes the two lines containing the hawk's moral are &gt;&gt;probably spurious&lt;, but nevertheless as old as Aristarchus who rejected them, and they may be considerably older&lt;&lt;. 12 Although the word is largely used in a human context, VERDENIUS 122 disproves WEST'S claim, ad loc., that 8ei3vov is used only of human meals in Homer by citing B 383 (horses). 13 Cf. VERDENIUS 121. WEST 206 and VERDENIUS 119-20 point out that the epithet noLxLX6- 8CLQog does not suit the nightingale. WEST, who argues that the epithet is more appropriate for thrushes (cf. Arist., H.A. 632bl9), may be right in thinking that the poet has substituted the nightingale for the dove, which is associated with thrushes. 14 DALY, art. cit. (above, n. 1), 47; ADDRADos, Historia de la fabula, I 388, however, believes that the poet's introductory words count as a prologue, brief as it is.</page><page sequence="4">406 STEVEN H. LONSDALE shrewdness on the part of either creature, as in the fable of the hawk and the nightingale (PERRY 4) where the nightingale argues that she is too small a bird to satisfy the hawk's appetite. Whereas there is obviously an agon between the hawk and nightingale, no resolution or motive for the contest is explicity stated, although aoLbov in verse 208 may give a clue. The status of the hawk and nightingale simply remains static'5. In certain respects, then, the passage has affinities with the epic simile which begins abruptly and often ends on a inconclusive or ominous note. WILAMOWITZ, in his commentary, states that the passage is &gt;&gt;only a simile&lt;&lt; 6. Several indications encourage reading the text as an omen, some of them suggested by the poem itself, and others by comparison with epic. First, the context of the poem is receptive to bird lore. Although Aesop abjured omens'7, Hesiod in 'The Works and Days' displays an interest in the craft of the diviner. The poem ends at line 828 with a reference to bird prophecy that looks back to a passage 28 lines earlier on the importance of consulting birds of men at the time of marriage. Proclus records the tradition that, according to some, the 'OQvLOo[tavTELa fol- lowed after the final verse'8. Although Apollonius of Rhodes, according to the scholiast, rejected the appended poem on bird divination as spurious, Pausanias (9.31.5) recorded in his list of poems ascribed to Hesiod two separate works that followed the 'The Works and Days', one of which was E3Enq ,LavTLxa. The two references to bird divination toward the end of the poem, plus an earlier reference to a bird omen at 747 strengthen the possibility of a poem on divination. But even without an appended 'OQvLOo[tavT4a the 'The Works and Days' shows a predis- position to treat birds in the context of prophecy'9. Since there are no omens in Hesiod of the type encountered in Homer, it is necessary to turn to epic examples to support a reading as an omen20. That a fable could also be read as an omen is not a priori unlikely. The famous omen at B 308 ff. 15 ADRADOS, Historia de la fabula, 193, calls the type of fable in which the stronger imposes his force on the victim without anything more happening as in Hesiod extremely rare or non-existent. 16 &gt;&gt;Es ist eigentlich keine Tierfabel, sondern nur ein Gleichnis,&lt;&lt; Hesiodos Erga (Berlin 1928), 64; contra PERRY, art. cit. (above, n. 3), 18, who suspects that WILAMowrrz so interpreted the passage because Hesiod's narrative was too short and not enough of a story. 17 Aesop (Vita Aes. 770), is made to interpret an omen of an eagle, and he thereby saves his master Xanthus from humiliation. But he makes no claims to prophetic gifts and considers the interpretation of omen an idle pursuit. 18 Scholia vetera in Hesiodi opera et dies, ed. by A. PERTUSI (Milan 1955), ad loc., cf. WEST 364-65. 19 The 'Works and Days' in general shows an interest in birds. Elsewhere in the poem birds appear as a class to be distinguished from mammals and sea creatures (Op. 277), in an agricultural context (Op. 470), and in a mythological allusion to the metamorphosis of the swallow who appears at the onset of Spring (Op. 568-69). 20 In Homer there is, of course, no beast fable, but birds appear in similes, omens, epiphanies and dreams. See WEST 27 and 205 on the similarity of Homeric and Hesiodic rhetorical techniques, cf. P. WALCOT, Hesiod and the Near East (Cardiff 1966), 124-25 on borrowings.</page><page sequence="5">Hesiod's Hawk and Nightingale (Op. 202-12) 407 of the snake and sparrows in the tree has parallels with fables dating back to the ancient Near East about a contest between a snake and a bird in a tree21. WEST, who argues that one medium through which the fable came to Greece was Near Eastern wisdom literature, observes &gt;not only fable itself, but its admonitory function was native to the orient&lt;&lt;22. The specific parallels between the Hesiodic passage and Homeric bird omens are of three kinds: thematic, structural, and linguistic. In Homer the actions of animals which receive interpretion as omens or portents are those involving a snake or a predatory bird attacking or devouring a small bird, exactly as in the Hesiodic passage23. Among the predatory birds are eagles and hawks which harry sparrows, doves, and the like. WALCOT believes that the hawk may been chosen for the aggressor because of its association with bird-omens2A. The hawk accord- ingly would add gravity to the poet's message. In Homer, the hawk appears in a portent that greets Telemakhos upon his return to Ithaka (o 525-28). There it is called b 6t;og OpvLg (525, 531) and the messenger of Apollo. The hawk in the portent carries a pigeon in its claws, much as in the Hesiodic passage. Theokly- menos interprets the hawk's supremacy over the pigeon as a sign of the sovereignty of Telemakhos' family on Ithaka. The portent thus parallels our passage both in terms of subjects, the hawk's action, and in its symbolic application to kingship. Compare the word PacoLtXvmpQov at o 533, with j3aoLke6a' (Op. 202)25. In a simile at N 62-65 Poseidon is compared to a hawk as he departs from the battlefield; moments before he was standing in the guise of the bird diviner Khal- kas encouraging the Aiantes (N 45-58). The connection between the hawk and prophecy here is suggested by context. Aias, son of Oileus, recognizes the foot- prints of the speaker to be those of a god, and remarks that a god, not the famed bird seer (OconQO63og O'OVL1ovt , N 70), spoke. "Ieil, the generic word for hawk, occurs elsewhere in Homer in similes with divinities as subjects of comparison26. Thus the hawk in Homer has divine and ominous connotations, and there is no reason to think that the associations are markedly different in Hesiod. In Homer, an omen is a supernatural phenomenon that, like a dream, often provokes or requires an interpretation. The interpreter is normally human but can 21 Cf. G. S.

An eagle, the only talking bird in Homer, is given human voice to interpret Penelope's dream of the eagle and the geese at T 546-7027. In analyzing the dream the eagle performs the same role as the bird diviner in relating a phenomenon in the natural world to a human event. In the Hesiodic passage there are in effect two responses to the hawk's attack on the nightingale. The first is spoken by the hawk at Op. 210 f. and the second by the poet himself in a postponed response at 276ff. on Zeus' allotment of bixq to mortals, but not to fish, land animals, and birds. The hawk's speech is called a RNOog, a word which is attested in classical Greek as a fable for children28. In Homer it is the substantive of the verb [LvsooiaL used at f3 159 of the superior ability of the diviner Halitherses to read an eagle omen29. The well-known overlap between omens and similes in Homer3o and the post- posed response to the hawk and nightingale invite a comparison with a hawk simile in the chase scene of the Iliad followed sometime later by Achilles' oaths parable. The simile at X 139-42 is part of a sequence of similes with ominous import for Hektor's eventual death31. It compares Achilles in pursuit of Hektor to a hawk swooping down upon a tremulous dove. As in the Hesiodic passage the distinction between predator and prey is emphasized by the use of the contrasting masculine and feminine article. The verb a6oxw also occurs in the simile, although here it applies to the hawk instead of to the victim32. The simile seems to suggest that the same lawlessness that applies in nature to predator and prey applies to Achilles' pursuit of Hektor on the battlefield; like the hawk, Achilles will go on to express a wish to eat Hektor raw (X 347). Fearing that something like this may be the case, Hektor appeals to justice by attempting to make Achilles swear an oath that the victor return the corpse to the enemy. Achilles responds at X 261-72 in a boasting speech of the kind that PUELMA compares to the hawk's menacing words to the nightingale. In his famous parable he negates the institution of oaths by placing his enmity with Hektor on the same plane as that between lions and men and wolves and sheep. Achilles' parable in effect interprets the simile in much the same way that the poet offers a postponed interpretation of the hawk and nightingale at Op. 276 ff. 27 Cf. PEABODY, The Winged Word (Albany 1975), 251-52. 28 L.S.J. 29 Cf. .iivtv 'AUXokwvog, A 75. 30 See, e. g., A. PODLECKI, Bird Omens in the Odyssey, G.&amp;R. 14 (1967), 12-23. 31 The sequence of similes begins with the race-horse simile (X 22-23), and continues with the dog-star simile (26-31), the snake simile (93-95), the fire and hawk vs. dove similes (139-142), the race-horse simile (162-64), the dog vs. fawn and dream similes (189-200), the eagle vs. lamb or hare and Hesperos similes (308-318).

(1983), 36-48, discusses the ominous import of the hawk simile in relation to other similes in II. 32 Cf. VERDENIUS 120, PUELMA, art. cit. (above, n. 6), 90f., 93, n. 33.</page><page sequence="7">Hesiod's Hawk and Nightingale (Op. 202-12) 409 At this point Hesiod repeats &gt;&gt;listen to justice&lt;&lt; (Op. 275, cf. 213). He reminds Perses of the dangers of hybris by stating the law that Zeus ordained for men (Op. 277-80): ?[that] as for fish and wild animals, and the flying birds, / they feed on each other, since there is no idea of justice among them; / but to men he gave justice, and she in the end is proved the best thing&lt;&lt;33. The mention of birds suggests that the poet still has the hawk and nightingale fresh in his mind34. The Homeric and Hesiodic interpretations of justice are similar for the animal world, but Achil- les' moral lesson allows for no distinction between man and beast. Although Achilles couches his moral in terms of a lack of oaths, while Hesiod expresses his in terms of b&amp;x, Hesiod follows up with a contrast between the disastrous effects of foreswearing oaths and the benefits of living by them35. The insistence on oaths in both passages makes it tempting to ask if Hesiod's clarification of the hawk's moral is not also a reversal of the negation of oaths in the famous Iliad passage. We know from the catalogue of Prometheus' gifts to mankind (P.V. 488-92) that the art of divination pressupposes knowledge about the birds' habits and about their loves and quarrels36. The Hesiodic narrative, of course, describes the enmity between the hawk and nightingale. The hawk and all thrush birds are natural enemies37. But in one crucial aspect the nightingale is the specific enemy of the hawk. When a nightingale is being pursued by a hawk it will blow its disguise by 33 Hesiod: The Works and Days (Ann Arbor 1959), tr. R. LArrIMORE. 34 Cf. WEST 226. 35 Ot&amp;E TLg ?V6OQXOU XaQSg (op. 190), cf. b; ovx ?a i ... 6Qc 3Oa (X 262). See M. GAGARIN, Dike in the Works and Days, Cl.Ph. 68 (1973), 90, on the connection between bcXq and the swearing of oaths. 36 WEST 365 believes that &gt;&gt;information about their enmities and loves must have involved some reference to metamorphosis-mythso. The metaphorical transformation of the nightingale into Dike (who may have been conceived in popular thought in winged form) may help to explain the choice of subject for the fable. From the divine bird epiphanies in Homer we know that gods frequently exchange shapes with birds. WELLES, art. cit. (above, n. 2), 19 and n. 45, points out that the negative attitude toward the nightingale stems from myths in which a woman - Prokne, Aedon, Philomela - undergoes transformation into a nightingale as punishment for killing her son Itys. The myth is already known in Homer, where it appears in a simile at t 518-23; Hesiod alludes to a version of the myth (Op. 568), which mentions the swallow, the nightingale's accomplice in the crime for serving up Itys to Niobe. The reference is to the swallow's song at the advent of spring, EaQog veov oTaEvoLo, a phrase applied somewhat less exactly to the nightingale in the Homeric version at T 519; for whereas the swallow's punishment as accomplice was to be sleepless only half of the year, the nightingale was to go forever without sleep, the better to mourn the loss of her son. The details of the punishment of Aedon and Khelidon were known to Hesiod, if one can trust Hes. Fr. 312 (= Ael., VH 12-20), where the illicit meal is called a brzivov 'aOEoRov. Although we have no proof that Aelian is reproducing Hesiod's words, ROSCHER, 11 570 s. Itys, believes it not unlikely that they are in fact his. If they are actually Hesiod's the 86?ivov (Op. 209) which the hawk threatens to make out of the nightingale may have an ironic ring. The emphasis on illicit eating may be related to the swindle over meat alluded to in the Prometheus exemplum (Op. 48, cf. Th. 535). 37 Arist. H.A. 620a 17-33.</page><page sequence="8">410 STEVEN H. LONSDALE emitting a cry of alarm to warn the other small birds in the area that a predator is in pursuit. The smaller birds may then mob the hawk and peck out its eyes38. I would suggest that the hawk alludes to the nightingale's annoying and potentially lethal habit when he refers to her as aoLo6v Eob,oav in 208. This naturalistic motive for the hawk's attack avoids the awkwardness of reconstructing a previous song-con- test between the hawk and nightingale39. It also accords with PuccI's interpreta- tion that like the nightingale, the poet heroically struggles against his oppressors in his mission to warn the 6i[tog, who will otherwise pay for the folly of the jcaoLkEi; when they pass crooked judgments40. From the Prometheus passage we also know that birds with crooked talons are of vital interest to the seer. In the Hesiodic passage the curved talons of the hawk (Op. 205) participate in the dichotomy between crooked/straight justice41 in 194, 219, 221, 224-6, 230, which is one of several Iron Age/Golden Age contrasts42. The 38 I owe this information to Ch. TAMBIAH, Fellow in Wildlife Conservation, Smithsonian Institution. Despite the realism, there is also a distortion of naturalism for dramatic effect in the Hesiodic passage: Hawks catch their prey with their curved talons, but kill them upon impact. Also, as W. B. STANFORD, Homer: Odyssey2, (London 1958) II, notes on the nightingale simile at T 518 ff., the female nightingale does not sing. 39 Conjectured by DALY, art. cit. (above, n. 1), 47-48. 40 Pucci, op. cit., (above, n. 6), 64-69. 41 Crooked talons and justice are juxtaposed in a Homeric context that is illuminating because of its relation to Zeus. In a simile at Hl 384-393 Zeus sends a flood when angered at men who pass crooked decrees and banish Dike; Zeus' reappearance in the narrative at H 431 and the epithet &amp;YXUXO 'T?-u (cf. its use with Kronos at H 431) is all the more striking because the epithet is obviously an echo of the epithet ayxvXoiXEkaL used of ya14d0vxe; (sc. aLyUnLoL) four lines earlier in a simile composed according to ring composition. In Hesiod 'ayxvoko s 'Tiis applied not to Zeus but to Kronos (Th. 137, 168, 473, 495), cf. Prometheus (Th. 546, Op. 48). 42 Hesiod's golden age is characterized, among other things, by peace, justice, family unity, abundant food, freedom from pain and toil, and harmony. Each of these elements is contrasted in the description of the Iron Age, and in certain cases again in the hawk and nightingale passage. Thus, the negative portrayal of the family in 182 - children and fathers who are unalike - is balanced by women who bear children like their parents in 235. The discordant words of children in 186, reinforced by the screaming of Envy in 195, are echoed in the screams of the nightingale in 207 and the public outcry and wailing of outraged Dike (220, 222). The theme of nurture in 188, which the ungrateful children will not even return to the aging parents, is contrasted with freedom from famine (230), Peace as a xovQorQopo; on earth (228), as well as the fertile flocks, honey bees, and bountiful harvest of the just community (223-37). In the hawk and nightingale the predator threatens to make a meal of the helpless song-bird (209). The pains that are left in the Iron Age once Aidos and Nemesis have departed from the earth (200) are reinforced by the pains which the hawk in his moral says the weaker suffers for opposing the stronger (211). The 6einrvov of the hawk can be compared to the bribes that the judges take (221). A further distinction between the Iron and Golden Ages can be inferred by taking Hesiod's portrayal of the raptor and prey as a response to the often positive light in which birds are represented in epic, where even the predatory vultures are held up as models of family loyalty in similes and omens, e. g. the vultures bereft of their young (3 216-18); cf. the self-sacrificing mother bird who feeds her young while she herself goes without food (I 232-34), the mother sparrow who experiences anguish as she stand by</page><page sequence="9">Hesiod's Hawk and Nightingale (Op. 202-12) 411 crooked words (InvOoLoL OxokLoig) of evil men in 194 are contrasted with the straight justice in 230 carried out by honest men in the just community. In the hawk and nightingale [tMo; is juxtaposed with the idea of crookedness in the adjective yvacqiTog 205 f. (Does this imply that the hawk's own p~ Oog is a crooked, i. e. untrue one?) This interaction between vocabulary from bird lore and the law court encourages taking the verb xQivw in 221 in the phrase OxokLfl; &amp; bFt g XQLVWOL 04ILorraq in its literal as well as in its technical sense of reading bird omens, such as it appears in 801 (oowvobg xQivag) and in the final line of the poem (oQvLOag xQLvwv)43. At one level the passage seems to be saying that it is Vi5QL; for the bribe- devouring judges to interpret laws with crooked justice, just as it is outrageous for the hawk to snatch up the nightingale in its crooked talons. But if we understand xQIvw and [Oog in their prophetic senses, we can see that another act of i,SQL; is being levelled at the hawk. As it is wrong for the judges to take justice into their own hands and &gt;&gt;read&lt; the law to their advantage, so it is unlawful for the hawk to interpret the import of its own actions. The adverb 'nLxQaTEWg in 206 supports this interpretation44. Perhaps there is even some implied injunction against animals talking now that they no longer live in the Golden Age of Kronos45, for later the poet will recall the law that under Zeus' reign &amp;ixq now applies only to men. Finally, a phrase from the hawk and nightingale resembles a Homeric omen in linguistic detail. pEQwv o6vU5XEooL ?i ptaQ0g (204) is the metrical equivalent of p?Qwv OVvxlXEOL ntXwQov at M 202, 220. It appears in the eagle omen interpreted by Polydamas which Hektor disregards to his peril. In sum, the hawk and nightingale has an affinity with omens in subject, content, structure, and linguistic detail. A prophetic bird with curved talons harries a smal- ler bird. That action is interpreted in human terms by the hawk, much as the eagle in the Odyssey interprets Penelope's dream of the eagle and geese. The word that introduces the hawk's speech is related to a verb used of reading omens. The prophetic overtones in the hawk and nightingale passage in turn awaken the tech- nical sense of xpivW in the ensuing narrative. A phrase from the hawk and nightin- gale resembles a Homeric omen in linguistic and metrical detail. Since fable and omen have natural affinities, and since it appears in the context of a poem receptive to prophetic bird lore, it is not unlikely that the passage in helplessly observing her young devoured in the omen of the snake and the sparrows (B 311-15), or the eagle prevented from returning home to feed its young (M 221-22); cf. EASTERLING, art. cit. (above, n. 5), 57-59. 43 Cf. the related form bVAxQ6Tou5, A., PV 458. 44 VERDENIUS 120 translates the adverb &gt;&gt;with overwhelming might&lt; and cites a Homeric parallel in Agamemnon's speech to Chryses introduced by the words xQaceQ6v b' iii pvOov ?mXe (A 25). 45 On the convention in fables of representing the action as taking place in the golden age of Kronos 6mT qp(ov'xa Av T'a t,pa see B.

LONSDALE: Hesiod's Hawk and Nightingale (Op. 202-12) Hesiod can also be read as a warning to the b6jto;, represented by Perses. A prophetic reading would then throw into an ironic light the poet's prefatory remarks to Perses that he will tell a tale that the IacLkoX will understand (sc. pQovEoiut, Op. 202). They will interpret it in a way favorable to them, i. e., as a fable for children46, that would almost seem to sanction the hawk's behavior; but taken in the context of the ensuing narrative in which the nightingale transforms into Dike, the passage has a more ominous meaning for the pmkcEl, who may lose their power and impunity. Instead of being sanctioned by Zeus as in the beginning, their very existence will be threatened by destruction. If we think of an omen as presaging something that will be accomplished in the near future, whereas a fable reveals a constant occurence or trait of human behavior47, the import of the hawk and nightingale is much more urgent as an omen than as a fable. It is Hesiod who clarifies the meaning of the fable/omen in retrospect when he says that Zeus gave &amp;Lxr to men alone while animals are left to devour one another48. In using the hawk's behavior as a model the iaaokpXcZ act as beasts, not men. It is as if they would prefer to see the blurring of animal and human worlds which is characteristic of the fable, but not of the omen, where the natural world is analogous to but distinct from the human. By disregarding it as a portent, they fail to perceive what is revealed about the workings of the world under Zeus' control. The interpretation of the hawk and nightingale in the context of a metaphorical transformation into 6(xr is not immediately apparent, and on its own the passage is ambiguous. If the passage inspired as much discussion among its intended audi- ence as it has among modern interpreters, its ambiguous implications would have served well the poet's larger purpose of rousing a clamorous debate among the people, so that the question of might versus right might have a fair hearing before Zeus. We have in Hesiod's hawk and nightingale yet another example of the interplay between poetry and prophecy. Davidson College, North Carolina STEVEN H. LONSDALE 46 Cf.
