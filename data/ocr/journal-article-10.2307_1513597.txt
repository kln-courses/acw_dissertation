<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEPARTMENT OF PRIMITIVE ART PRECOLUMBIAN ART PAIR OF WARRIOR FIGURES Peruvian (Moche), lst-3rd century. Gilded copper with shell and stone inlays, height 43/4" (12.1 cm); 53/8" (13.7 cm). Gift ofJane Costello Goldberg, from the collection of Arnold I. Goldberg. 1981.459.31,32 These hollow warrior figures, constructed of many pieces of gilded copper sheet metal crimped and tabbed together, were meant to hang freely by a thick wire extend- ing out from the backs of their heads. Such dangling figures are highly unusual in ancient Peruvian art; only one other is known, and it comes from the same site as these. Their use remains unknown. Another unusual aspect of these figures is the presence of smaller figures, with high-relief heads and incised bodies, on the backs of their shirts. One warrior bears a splayed feline, whose tail extends down past the bottom of the shirt. The other bears disembodied human parts: a head, two feet, and two hands. Both the feline and the dis- embodied human parts are related to a cult of human sac- rifice and trophy-head taking in which warriors apparently participated by providing victims. These two figures are from a cache of metal objects- numbering almost 600 and most of them gilded copper- that was found in 1969 at a site called Loma Negra, in far northern Peru. It is the largest find of Moche metalwork known to date. The gilding was done by an ingenious proc- ess of electrochemical replacement plating; copper corro- sion products now cover most of the surfaces. Bibliography: Disselhoff, Hans-Dietrich.

Vogel, Senior Consultant for Afrian Art; Anne-Louise Schaffer, Andrew W. Melon Felow before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas have unpolished, monochrome, but significantly decorated surfaces. Deeply incised punctate designs and added raised elements, often in the form of human or animal heads, embellish the plain, almost gritty-textured vessels. The vessel illustrated here, with two raised pairs of heads at either side, has a distinctly ornate outline. It is reported to be from the interior of Hispaniola, not far from the bor- der between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The un- derstated vigor of the beige and gray brown ceramics is a quality common to the art of the islands at this time.

Meyer. 1981.297 eramic vessels in sculptural form have a long history in ancient Mesoamerica. As early as the first millennium B.C., ceramic vessels were made in the shape of animals, birds, and human figures; in later times the basic vessel shape took precedence over the form of the depicted figure. The round-bodied vessels that depict bird and animal forms, such as the one illustrated here, exemplify the later approach. Often three-legged, these vessels enjoyed con- siderable popularity when they were made. They were also widely traded. The marked stylistic diversity among them is an indication both of their success and of their wide distribution. The present bird vessel is carefully conceived-the line of the wings echoes the angle of the legs-and elegantly finished-the shiny dark red and black of the polished sur- face contrast well with the matte, powdery quality of the head and feet. A degree of anthropomorphism is present, most notably in the large "thumbs." JJ AFRICAN ART SEATED FIGURE Mali (Djenne), early 13th century. Terracotta, height 10" (25.3 cm). Purchase, Buckeye Trust and Mr. and Mrs. Milton F. Ro- senthal Gifts, Joseph Pulitzer Bequest, and Harris Brisbane Dick and Rogers Funds. 1981.218 This seated male figure with elaborate raised and punched scarification on his back is shown clasping his raised knee in both arms. The figure is conceived as a slow heavy curve around an opening in the center of the body, with the bold line of the back played off against the sinu- ously entwined limbs in the front. The total lack of tension 66 in the body, which seems almost boneless and muscleless, the pensive attitude, and the bald head suggest that it might depict a mourner. In traditional African societies, mourners often shave their heads and sit on the ground. The artist has given this figure almost no anatomical details except for the gently curving shoulder blades, the fingers, and toes. He has also simplified all the features of the head and subordinated them to the long sweeping curve of the back and neck, which culminates in the expressive turn of the head. The roughness of some details and the suppres- sion of others may have to do with the expression of grief. In Africa, as elsewhere, the mourning period is one of dep- rivation and austerity. Mourners eat little and often cover their bodies with ashes, or are forbidden to bathe. Thermoluminescence tests of this figure show that it was fired during the first half of the thirteenth century. Excava- tion has only just begun on the archaeological site of Djenne, on the inland delta of the Niger River. Finds from the site, however, include a vast array of terracotta figures with a complex iconography executed in several styles. Most figures date from the twelfth century to the seventeenth. Djenne sculptures are usually solid although they are relatively well fired-probably in open-pit kilns fueled by wood and straw. Many figures are massive, and compact in composition-rarely pierced as here-though, like this one, they often have relaxed, asymmetrical poses. Djenne artists seem to have had considerable freedom in their choice of subject. The Djenne region is one of politically centralized states and a long history of trade with the Islamic world. The Em- pire of Ghana, whose beginnings are lost in time, fell in 1076. Parts of Ghana were absorbed into the Mali Empire, which before its fall in 1468 exported considerable amounts of gold to North Africa. The city of Djenne is situated within the borders of the Mali Empire and was converted to Islam at the end of the twelfth century. Mansa Musa, one of ancient Mali's great rulers, made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca about 1325, passing through Cairo on the way. When Mali fell, it was succeeded by the Songhai Empire, which in turn lasted until about 1600. Whoever they were, the build- ers of Djenne and the makers of Djenne sculptures saw the fall of Mali and the rise of Songhai, and lived in a world that</page><page sequence="3">was part of a vast trade network that reached thousands of miles from the forests of the Guinea Coast through Tim- buktu and across the Sahara Desert to the Mediterranean. sv MASTER OF THE CASCADE COIFFURE Zaire (Luba people, Shankadi subgroup), 19th century NECKREST WITH FEMALE FIGURE Wood, beads, height 63/4" (16.2 cm). Gift of Margaret Barton Plass, in honor of William Fagg (C.M. G.). 1981.399 his neckrest is one of a group recognized as being the work of a single anonymous master. Because of his exuberant treatment of the typical Shankadi fan-shaped coiffure, he is known as the Master of the Cascade Coiffure. He is the creator of a series of charming neckrests sup- ported by small sculptures; no larger works by his hand are known. A miniaturist at heart, he gives a great deal of at- tention to refined workmanship and delicacy of carving. His works can be recognized by his dramatic treatment of the sweeping coiffure for which he is named, by his use of balanced asymmetrical poses, and by his fondness for ac- tive, open compositions; triangular openings under the arms and legs often repeat the shape of the wedges of the hair. The sculptures lack volume; they are all sharp angles and thin linear forms, made even more dynamic by a tor- sion of the body. This female figure, with her asymmetrical pose, is one of the most animated and inventive figures by the Master of the Cascade Coiffure. Her one leg bent back and one leg raised, one hand to her stomach and the other to her hair give her a lively, playful quality characteristic of the artist's best works. Of the fewer than twenty works identified as by this master, none repeats this posture. Constantly ex- perimenting, the artist in fact rarely repeats himself, even within the narrow confines of the neckrest format. Often his figures gesture or are shown doing something in a way seldom seen in African art. Despite the animation of his figures and the broken silhouette of his caryatids, the Mas- ter of the Cascade Coiffure never fails to provide a satisfy- ingly solid-looking vertical support down the center of his compositions. Elaborate coiffures like the one shown here took up to fifty hours to produce, and could last for months if properly cared for. Sleeping on a neckrest helped to preserve the coiffure.

Wood, height 211/4" (54 cm). Gift of Lawrence Gussman. 1981.397 he image of the mother and child is so often found in African art that it is important to remember it almost never represents an ordinary woman with a baby. Rather, it is likely to refer to the invisible world, to what is known or believed more than to what is seen. Among the Senufo, the Creator is conceived as dualistic in nature, and in its protec- tive, nurturing aspect is known as Ancient Mother. Mem- bers of the men's Poro society say they are "at our Mother's 67</page><page sequence="4">work" when they are engaged in Poro affairs, and Poro ini- tiates are referred to as "children of Poro." One scholar has suggested that figures such as this one allude to the initia- tion process, wherein Poro absorbs unformed adolescents, nurses them with the milk of knowledge, and redelivers them as complete human beings, adult members of society. This figure exudes palm oil from years of libations, a phenomenon often seen in sculpture from Gabon but found only rarely in art of the Western Sudan. Signifi- cantly, one of the few other Senufo figures with an oil sur- face is in a style very close to this one. The segmentation, geometrization, and simplification of the human body seen in this sculpture are typical of African art. All except essential features are rigorously eliminated; here, for example, coiffure and facial scarification are es- sential to the identity of the figure, but the front legs of the stool are superfluous, and they have thus been omitted. Because the child is significant for its suckling gesture, the head and mouth are carefully rendered, while the less im- portant arms and legs are made amorphous, suggesting the socially undefined initiate. The figure is animated by a spi- ral movement through the entire body that puts the left leg in profile when the face is seen from the front. sv OCEANIC ART HELMET MASK WITH PRAYING MANTIS New Britain (Sulka people), before 1914. Wood, paint, height 431/2" (110.5 cm). Gift of Evelyn A. J. Hall. 1981.331.1 he Sulka are a group of about 1,100 people who live on the northeast coast of New Britain. Although they have been in contact with Westerners-originally, missionaries and traders-for about a century, little is known about them to this day, a deplorable fact in view of the fascination of their fragile and highly colorful art. Unlike so many other Melanesian groups, the Sulka were not devoted carvers, but they made several types of masks, the most famous being the sisu, which are cone shaped with humanoid fea- tures, and the umbrellalike hemlaut. These were painstak- ingly constructed from innumerable narrow strips of pith and painted primarily in a glaring pink, with fine details and large flowing designs in white, black, yellow, and green. Accessory human features such as ears and mouths, as well as figures of humans, animals, and birds, were carved in light wood and attached to the masks. A lesser-known type of mask or dance costume is repre- sented by this carving. The animal shown here is a quite naturalistically formed praying mantis, its body growing out of a swelling cone. The natural wood surface is covered with geometric patterns in blue black and faded green min- eral colors. The mask was clearly meant to be carried on the head, since the interior of the cone is hollow. Comparison with objects now in Budapest and Cologne (Gathercole et al.) suggests that the vertical projection at the back was intended to support a slender upright standard, most likely cut from light wood and painted with a typical Sulka cur- sive design. The total assembly would have been about thirteen feet high. The significance of the object is unknown, although it has been remarked that a neighboring tribe used similar constructions at "a festival commemorating the dead, which also formed the end of the circumcision rites" (Kaufmann, 1979). That such objects were canoe prow or- naments seems questionable in view of their fragility, al- though carvings known to be from prows certainly show the same general form (Kaufmann, 1980). Our carving, one of a pair, was collected before 1914 and until recently was with its mate at the Missionsmuseum, Hiltrup, Germany; the mate is now at the Museum fur Vol- kerkunde, Basel (Vb 28055). The two works are practically identical in size, and are surely by the same hand; the only significant difference between them is the painted design on the cone, which in the Basel example is of the cursive type.
