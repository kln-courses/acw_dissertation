<plain_text><page sequence="1">Playful Paws Brian Massumi's What Animals Teach Us about Politics, Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2014 Lisa Poggiali What do animals teach us about politics? This is the central question of Brian Massumi s brief, though complex meditation on animality, hu- manity, and the relational dance through which they each become them- selves. Frequently opaque, though occasionally beautiful - "The story of evolution is a mad proliferation of forms so fertile as to defy the human imagination" (21), Massumi remarks in a particularly lucid moment - his text invites the reader along on an idea-journey rather than providing a straightforward analysis of what animal politics are or could be - this de- spite the fact that the text is formally polemical, the main essay closing, for example, with fourteen "propositions" that outline "what animals teach us about politics." The central thesis that coils through the book, boa constrictor-like, is that the point of departure for thinking politics should not be humanity, but animality. Thus, Massumi writes against the liberalism foundational to most animal studies scholarship, the proponents of which argue that human rights should be extended to animals. The crux of Massumi s ar- gument is radically different; namely, that to start from the perspective of "human rights" means to deny the animality that is immanent to humani- ty - and the humanity immanent to animality - and thus to misrecognize both. This is no space, he intuits, from which to begin political analysis or to articulate political claims. Epistemologically, Massumi decenters the human and (re)places her "on the animal continuum" (3). Contrary to what he sees as the anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism implicit in more conventional theories of animality, for Massumi, the paw engulfs the hand without replacing it; the human/ animal dialectic implodes.

Philosophically, Massumi merges critical theory and evolutionary biology, drawing on such thinkers as Deleuze and Guattari, Gregory Bateson, Raymond Ruyer, and Alfred North Whitehead. "Play" is his way in. It is the central concept that anchors his text, and thus the concept from which his understanding of politics unfolds. For Massumi, Bateson s notion of play as a theory of difference is instructive. A wolf cub communicates whether it is biting (engaging in combat) or nipping (en- gaging in play) through the style in which it performs - and enacts - the gesture. "A ludic gesture in a play fight ... is not so much 'like' a combat move as it is combatesque : like in combat, but with something different, a little something more. With a surplus: an excess of energy or spirit" (9). The crucial point for Massumi - and what sets him apart from some other thinkers of animality, such as Giorgio Agamben - is that play and combat are neither distinct zones in an absolute sense, nor do they meld complete- ly with one another, i.e., they do not produce either an "excluded middle" or a zone of undifferentiation. Rather, they operate according to the logic of the "included middle." Combat modulates the game, and play stylistical- ly deforms combat, nudging each into a "zone of indiscernibility" where their differences are nevertheless maintained. The logic of play, for Massu- mi, is one of "mutual inclusion." Mutual inclusion governs the process through which the animal con- tinuum differentiates and reproduces itself, which is to say, the process through which humans become themselves. It is in the creativity implicit in animal play that one can be able to think (and do) human creativity. This "zone of indiscernibility" therefore "does not observe the sanctity of the separation of categories, nor respect the rigid segregation of arenas of ac- tivity" (6). While Massumi is clear that there is no foundational or norma- tive distinction between human and animal, animal politics nevertheless cannot be understood vis-à-vis hybridity, i.e., a melding or a blurring of boundaries. Hybridity assumes undifferentiation. Animal politics, rather,</page><page sequence="3">Playful Paws 333 is a mode of maintaining difference in the face of the continual creation of future copossibilities. "When we humans say 'this is play/" says Massumi, "we are assuming our animality" and when animals play "they are prepara- torily enacting human capacities" (8). Where can one locate subjectivity in animal politics? How does human becoming - and by extension, nature itself - unfurl? On this question, Massumi is critical of both subject- and object-oriented ontologies. "There is no subject behind the creative act," Massumi cautions, "existing prior to the process. The subject is always ahead of itself, in the movement of expression" (96). In order to think the world, he tells us, we must start at events rather than objects, processes rather than substances. To capture the forward motion of animal politics, Massumi invokes Alfred North Whitehead s idea of the "super ject," which he describes as "always to come, or already surpassed in a next pulse of life" (96). Agency is thus a fraught concept for conceptualizing animal/human becoming; rather, the "actor" of animal politics is a "subjectivity-without-a-subject." Nature is (recreat- ed through self-propulsion, dynamically surpassing the given world. There is therefore also no place for Bruno Latour s "parliament of things" in ani- mal politics,1 as this concept denies the world its processual character. As Massumi puts it, "The world is made up of verbs and adverbs more primor- dially than nouns and adjectives. One sniff at the parliament of things, and the animal s expressive event is apt to snarl: smells of representation" (40). One of the most successful sections of Massumi s book - and one that can help us think through the problem of survival - is his commentary on the zoo, entitled "The Zoo-ology of Play." Of course, zoos are spaces where animals Uve in a kind of suspended animation. For some, captivity quite literally shortens their life span; the day-to-day experience of life as simu- lacrum takes its toll. Animals cannot "survive" here. For others, the zoo is a space to regain life that would otherwise be lost. Behind the iron bars that categorically separate humans from animals, the latter can quite literally live beyond the parameters imposed by the natural world (a natural world that is, of course, always already social). But this is not the kind of survival Massumi is interested in; this is a survival that is imagined as purely utili- tarian, devoid of play. For Massumi, survival is wrapped up with the issue of instinct, which in his formulation - via Darwin and biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen - is creative and expressive, rather than functional. Play, Massumi tells us, is present in all instinctive acts. "In nature, creativity and instinct are inex-</page><page sequence="4">334 Lisa Poggiali tricably entwined. They are in the act together, and play out together in the forward sweep of supernormal tendency carrying both to higher pow- ers" (91). As a gesture of living beyond the given, survival, too, is creative and expressive. Survival is the possibility, always present, that the animal continues to enact gestures with vitality despite the rigidity of human ex- ceptionalism that reigns supreme in a space like the zoo. When humans recognize this vitality, they assume their animality. Animal politics is thus sympathetic; it emerges when humans willingly relinquish their sovereign- ty. "There was never a child that did not become-animal in play," Massumi reminds us. "The project of animal politics: to make it so that the same could be said of adults" (89). If there is a question to be raised about Massumi s politics, it is that he is perhaps not prescriptive enough. How might humans sympathetically connect to their animality - enabling them to reimagine and thereby in- tervene differently in the anthropocene at large - when so many arenas of everyday life mimic the dynamics of the zoo? How can we (humans) recognize animal vitality in a way that does not simply anthropomorphize; in other words, how can we bring ourselves closer to, rather than further from ourselves, opening up new political horizons in the process? Massu- mi offers us a hopeful starting point - noncognitive animal gesture as a way to move continuously between the "is" and the "could be" - but not a roadmap, however tentative, to arrival. Perhaps a roadmap would be anti- thetical to animal politics itself, a denial of the creativity intrinsic to animal instinct, and the difference that it could thereby produce. If there is a critique to be leveled on Massumi s text, however, it is not so much with its ideas as with the way they are expressed. On the one hand, new thoughts demand new language to make sense of them; Massumi pro- duces both in spades. However, his linguistic play at times seems more of a stylistic exercise than a means to propel us beyond rigid structures of thought. Does not, after all, animal play reproduce the world at least as often as it reinvents it? How far must one travel down the rabbit hole of neologisms in order to write like a bunny wiggles its nose, or as he puts it, "like a rat flicks its tail" (55)? Thankfully, Massumi s metacommentary on language rarely detracts from his broader argument; more often than not it produces a rhythm that, fittingly, recalls animal gestures themselves: a wolf cub bumbling out of its den, a hummingbird fluttering in a strong gust of wind, a chick pecking assiduously at its mother s head.</page><page sequence="5">Playful Paws 335 Lisa Poggiali is an interdisciplinary scholar who combines the insights of science and technology studies with ethnographic methodologies to interrogate the sociopolitical di- mensions of new technologies and infrastructures in urban Africa, in particular Kenya.

With the concept "parliament of things" Latour ( 1993) attempts to decenter the human and foreground the "quasi- object" or "hybrid" - which are ways of knowing that gather together nature, culture, science, and society in com- plex interrelation - as a way to move beyond the dualistic thinking founda- tional to modernity (nature/society; object/subject).
