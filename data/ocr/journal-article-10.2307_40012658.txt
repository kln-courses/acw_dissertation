Printed in the Netherlands. University of Georgia Who could imagine, replied Demea, that Cleanthes, the calm, philosophical Cleanthes, would attempt to refute his antagonists by affixing a nickname to them, and, like the common bigots and inquisitors of the age, have recourse to invective and declamation instead of reasoning? Or does he not perceive that these topics are easily retorted, and that anthropo- morphite is an appellation as invidious, and implies as dangerous consequences, as the epiphet of mystic with which he has honoured us? Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion1 Indeed, as Hume's Demea here hotly contends, the terms "anthropomorphite" and "anthropomorphism" have long been means for verbal abuse in discussions of theological language. It is the purpose of this paper to reexamine the justice of this deep seated antagonism to anthropomorphism in discourse about God, and to offer reasons to praise rather than to bury such speech. Before I conclude, I shall have occasion to comment on the ethical issues involved in acknowledging or denouncing anthropomorphic language at the lower end of the Great Chain of Language, as it links not only God and man but also man and animals. I shall also make a sharp distinction between anthropomorphism, which I hold is in- evitable and often justified, and mthiopocentrism, which is not. I The main motive for rejecting the use of anthropomorphic language in connec- tion with God lies deep in the tradition of spirituality that insists on defending the * Prepared for the Conference on God: The Contemporary Discussion, held in Seoul, S.

The horror of engaging in idolatry, the misplacement of worship from the sacred to the secon- dary, is a long and worthy religious sensibility. Hume skillfully plays on this theme when he has the skeptical Philo join the orthodox Demea in ironic alliance against anything tainted with the merely human: "I was from the beginning scandalized, I must own," Philo says, "with this resemblance which is asserted between the Deity and human creatures, and must conceive it to imply such a degradation of the Supreme Being as no sound theist could endure."2 Such a motive, rooted in fundamental value intuitions, is easy to respect in view of the grossness of some of the background religious practices and conceptions against which this spiritual revulsion was aimed. Ancient Greek methology, attrib- uting blatant sexual misconduct and other all-too-human foibles to the gods, was offensive to morally sensitive Greeks like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; the vulgar ideas and rituals of the Canaanites deeply offended the Hebrew prophets. The in- comparable power and majesty of the true focus of worship, as against the feeble constructions of human hands and brains, is well sung by Isiah: To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him? The idol! a workman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts for it silver chains.... Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is he who sits above the circle of the earth and its inhabitants are like grass- hoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing.... To whom then will you compare me, that I should be like him? says the Holy One.3</page><page sequence="3">205 This strong religious inclination to insist upon the specialness of the sacred and thus to recoil from any downgrading of the ultimately worthful by classing it with the valuationally secondary is encountered in many traditions and cultures. The Hindu neti, neti ("not that, not that") refuses to identify the ultimate with any- thing proximate.4 The Christian mystic returns from his or her rapture with warn- ings and advice against using profane language as though it could give access to the ineffable.5 In the various religious traditions of the world, as well, the valuationally-based revulsion from degrading the most worthy becomes a logically- expressed prohibi- tion against the use of positive predication in language about the most real. Avi- cenna among Muslim philosophers and Maimonides among Jewish are strong con- tenders for the doctrine of negative theology, succinctly summarized in The Ency- clopedia of Philosophy as follows: According to this doctrine, nothing positive can be known about God, who has nothing in common with any other being. No predicate or descriptive term can legitimately be applied to him unless it is given a meaning which is wholly different from the one the term has in common usage and is purely negative. All statements concerning God considered in himself should, if they are to be regarded as true, be interpreted as providing an indication of what God is not. This applies even to the statement that God exists.6 Immanuel Kant, from a different theoretical context, gave arguments for the general incapacity of the human mind to cognize the noumenal realm into which God, if there be a God, would need to be classified. But the noumenal realm is defined only "problematically" or "limitatively," by Kant. As he puts it, "The concept of a noumenon is ... merely limitative, and intended to keep the claims of sensibility within proper bounds, therefore of negative use only."7 In consequence of this, Kant concludes: Our understanding thus acquires a kind of negative extension, that is, it does not become itself limited by sensibility, but, on the contrary, limits it, by calling things by themselves (not considered as phenomena) noumena. In doing this, it immediately proceeds to prescribe limits to itself, by admitting that it cannot know these noumena by means of the categories, but can only think of them under the name of something unknown...8 S^ren Kierkegaard pushes the unknowability of God over the brink of paradox, by declaring that the infinite gap between the finite and infinite requires that God, the Wholly Other, be declared the Wholly Unknowable. "So let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it."9 If this is so, then there is no logical impediment (here is the paradox that delights and stimulates Kierkegaard) to considering God (if wholly unknowable) Wholly Like the human, as is affirmed in the Christian doctrine of Incarnation, God-become-fully-man.10</page><page sequence="4">206 II This paradox has brought us full circle and must suggest that something is wrong with a doctrine that, by means of fierce opposition to anthropomorphism, ends by embracing it in its most complete theological expression. This is not to suggest that something is wrong with the religious sensibility that finds itself impelled to stress the vastness of the qualitative difference between the proper focus of worship and the human world of dullness and compromise. Nor is it to criticize the spirituality that prescribes the systematic emptying of the mind as a method of gaining in- describably valuable religious experiences of unity with the Holy. Nor is it, of course, to fault the doctrine of Incarnation or the religious intuition, lying behind it, that senses the identity of the Cosmic Logos with the Son of Man. These matters are not at issue here. What I suggest, rather, is that the spiritual motives behind the prohibition of anthropomorphism are ill-served when formalized into a logical doctrine that can- not be followed, finally without self- destructive consequences. It is only by affirm- ing anthropomorphic discourse, under constraints, that spirituality can in the end be focused and forwarded by the mind. St. Thomas Aquinas realized the difficulties in the full-fledged via negativa of Maimonides. As Thomas writes: But as regards names of God said absolutely and affirmatively, as good, wise, and the like, various and many opinions have been held. For some have said that all such names, although they are applied to God affirmatively, nevertheless have been brought into use more to remove something from God than to posit something in Him. Hence they assert that when we say that God lives, we mean that God is not like an inanimate thing; and the same in like manner applies to other names. This was taught by Rabbi Moses [Mai- monides] .n The problems with this position, taken as logical doctrine rather than as pious praise for God, are fatal, however. First, Thomas points out, on the basis of the via negativa there is no way in principle that a reason could be given "why some names more than others should be applied to God."12 If "God lives" is meant merely to deny something, why not equally say "God is dead" or "God is a body" or "God is a mushroom" or "God is a polka-dotted balloon," or the like, in a mere- ly negative sense? What does it matter, if nothing whatever is meant positively, what is said or not said in spiritual matters? On what criterion are we to guide our speech in order to avoid error and even blasphemy? Nothing remains. Next, on this doctrine any terms used for God "would be said of Him by way of being taken in a secondary sense,"13 but this is demeaning religiously (how can the creature be primary as against the creator?) as well as radically unanchored logical- ly. Any alleged secondary sense would not be interpretable without some primary sense to ground its meaning in the context of the divine. Third, as Thomas correctly points out, "this is against the intention of those</page><page sequence="5">207 who speak of God. For in saying that God lives, they assuredly mean more than to say that ... He differs from inanimate bodies."14 What, though, can we human beings mean "more" by our words except what we, by human experience, have come to understand? If we mean something at all significant by the affirmation that "God lives" - something more than the denial that God is as inanimate as a stone or as automatic as the tides - then we must draw upon those internal experiences of creativity and joy and vitality that may count, in rare moments, as the peak experiences of human life. If we mean some- thing at all by the words "good" or "wise," cited by Thomas, then the general domains of human goodness - though doubtless greatly magnified - and of human wisdom - though expanded beyond our limited capacities to imagine - must be presupposed. This is, of course, anthropomorphism. It is, however, not vulgar anthropo- morphism, attributing obscene or unworthy traits to the divine. On the contrary, it is precisely by the selection of specific traits acknowledged as eminently worthy that (logically) believers may eliminate the unworthy in connection with the Most High. Without some such positive criterion, as we have seen, anything goes. Not only so, but even the religious evocation of the Holy itself, in its incom- parable grandure, often relies on the use of frank but unobjectionable anthropo- morphic imagery. Isaiah, in the passage cited above, while denouncing the de- meaning of God, does not shrink from depicting the Holy One as "sitting" above the circle of the earth, and looking down from a great height at grasshopper-like earthlings, smug with their ludicrous pride. He pictures God, like a nomad pa- triarch, stretching out the great tent roof of the sky as a dwelling. The passage, of course, despite its vivid imagery, does not itself in the slightest demean God. With- out these harmless anthropomorphisms, the prophet-poet could never have ex- pressed so well his wonderfully ironic judgment upon vicious anthropocentrism. We saw earlier that Immanuel Kant was one of the most resolute opponents of anthropomorphic (or any intelligible human) discourse when applied to the domain he "problematically" defined as the noumenal; but even Kant found it necessary to allow speech reflecting human conceptualises rather than to enforce sheer silence about God. God, for him, was a postulate of pure practical reason and filled the need of assuring that the summwn bonum (the proper adjustment of happiness to morality) is not beyond final reach. But such assurance, though re- quired for thinking in accordance with the necessities of morality, depends on imagining God as capable of knowing our moral worth and acting with perfect dependability to arrange the proper balance according to our deserts over the long run, including life beyond this worldly existence. As Kant puts it: Therefore, the summum bonum is possible in the world only on the suppo- sition of a Supreme Being having a causality corresponding to moral charac- ter. Now a being that is capable of acting on the conception of laws is an intelligence (a rational being), and the causality of such a being according to this conception of laws is his will; therefore the supreme cause of nature, which must be presupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being</page><page sequence="6">208 which is the cause of nature by intelligence and will, consequently its author, that is God.15 But such language is clearly anthropomorphic and, on Kant's earlier argument, quite illicit. How does he handle the problem of talk about "moral character," "intelligence," and "will" in reference to a noumenal being, when even the lan- guage of "cause" and "time" have been proscribed as supplied by the mind? His answer is not clear, but in the Critique of Judgment he returns to the matter by making a distinction between "thinking" and "cognizing." The need to represent God somehow is practically pressing, forced by thinking in accordance with morali- ty, and therefore a special analogical dispensation is allowed, as follows: ...if I wish to think a supersensible Being (God) as an intelligence, this is not only permissible in a certain aspect of my employment of Reason - it is unavoidable; but to ascribe to Him Understanding and to flatter ourselves that we can cognize Him by means of it as a property of His, is in no way permissible. For I must omit all those conditions under which alone I know an Understanding, and thus the predicate which only serves for determining man cannot be applied at all to a supersensible Object; and therefore by a causality thus determined, I cannot cognise what God is. And so it is with all Categories, which can have no significance for cognition in a theoretical aspect, if they are not applied to objects of possible experience. - However, according to the analogy of an Understanding I can in a certain other aspect think a supersensible being, without at the same time meaning thereby to cognise it theoretically....16 Even Kant finds it impossible to dispense with (circumspect) anthropomorphic discourse, then, even though his explanation of how it is logically justified through "a certain other aspect" leaves much to be desired. Little wonder, then, that Lud- wig Feuerbach goes all the way in drawing his conclusion: Where man deprives God of all qualities, God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being. To the truly religious man, God is not being with- out qualities.... The denial of determinate, positive predicates concerning the divine nature is nothing else than a denial of religion, with, however, an ap- pearance of religion in its favour, so that it is not recognized as a denial; it is simply a subtle, disguised atheism. The alleged religious horror of limiting God by positive predicates is only the, irreligious wish to know nothing more of God, to banish God from the mind.... He who dreads an existence that may give offence, who shrinks from the grossness of a positive predicate, may as well renounce existence altogether.17 Ill My aim to this point has been to show that positive predication, what has often been denounced as anthropomorphism, not only is not necessarily demeaning religiously to the Most High but also is necessarily not avoidable logically if the</page><page sequence="7">209 language of either the believer or the philosopher is not to be emptied of all content and all thought about God, however reverently intended, thus to be made impos- sible. I have not here attempted to argue for any analysis of how such positive predi- cates are to be taken. This is a daunting problem, and one with which Thomas Aquinas wrestled hard. His basic sense was right, that we need the thread a way between crass literalism, on the one hand, and self-defeating negativism, on the other. His own proposals for this middle way of analogy are beset with difficulties of their own, as I have on various occasions attempted to point out in detail,18 but, as Kant also saw, some middle way is needed. Helpful suggestions sometimes come from unexpected directions, and in this case we might profit from contemplating the issue of anthropomorphic language as it relates not to the higher reaches of mystery, "upward" towards God, but rather to what we often call the "lower" orders, towards the animals. There has recently been much sneering about "anthropomorphism" in connection with animal protectionists' criticisms made against contemporary methods of raising meat-animals in stalls where, for a whole lifetime, they can neither exercise nor so much as turn around, or against egg-production methods in which chickens are kept in small cages in lighted rooms, where round-the-clock laying onto con- veyor belts is achieved at the cost of all other normal activities. Critics of this economically profitable tenderizing and mechanizing of animals are told that they are attributing "anthropomorphic" frustrations to the creatures involved, and that in the absence of any knowledge of animal preferences - or, indeed, whether there are any such things at all as animal preferences - they should refrain from "complaining with their mouths full."19 There may be useful parallels here to the arguments over negative theology. From the fact that certain characteristics are well understood in connection with human life, e.g., anguish from imprisonment and forced labor, frustration from inability to participate in normal physical and social activities, etc., it is held that only in connection with human life can such characteristics be understood. Swine and poultry are not human; and therefore, we are told, moral criticisms based on anthropomorphic extensions of our concerns to them are without basis or point. Mary Midgley effectively criticises the assumptions behind this argument, how- ever, as follows: ...the argument... apparently runs: Our idea of jc...is made up of elements drawn from human life: But x is not human: Therefore that idea is only a mirror and tells us nothing about x. Now this argument is not really impressive because it proves far too much. It suggests that the sphere of "human life" can never be extended. Yet it often is extended. Every new thing that we meet has to be under- stood in terms drawn from earlier human experience. This is inevitable, because "understanding" anything new simply is relating it to what we have already experienced, finding a way to bring it within reach of our existing range of concepts. The newness of the new thing has to be assimilated or</page><page sequence="8">210 digested in this way if we are to make it ours. Of course sceptics are right to point out that we make all kinds of mistakes in doing this. But this argument cannot support a more drastic scepticism, because the mistakes can only count as mistakes if we take the correcting insight to be less mistaken.20 The animals around us, however, are not even strange "new things" that need to be somehow awkwardly incorporated into our conceptual framework. On the con- trary, as Midgley points out, the earliest known contexts for the formation of human languages were the very contexts in which rich and varied interactions with animals were already implicit. What we mean by such terms as "frightened," for example, includes as part of its broad range of meaning not only the frightened hunter running from the tiger but also the frightened deer running from the hunter! This does not commit us to the view, of course, that the qualities of the fright of the hunter or of the deer - much less of the bird or the fish - are all identical. Language allows for variety within its range of generality. But it is a strange aberra- tion, allowed only recently by the unprecedented domination by our hypertechni- cal civilization of all other species, to make the anthropocentric assumption that would restrict the true meaning of all such terms to human beings alone. These are, rather, terms generated in the "mixed community" - humans and other spe- cies - that has been characteristic of the vastly greater part of human experience.21 If this is so, then the semantic scruples of the defenders of modern methods in egg-production, for example, turn out to be more ad hoc defenses of economic unscrupulousness than eternal truths of logic. It is surely true that we cannot pre- tend to see the world in all respects confidently from a chicken's point of view, but this fact does not invalidate all ethical concerns about the creatures with whom we interact and whose fate is sometimes in our hands. In the mixed community there are many deep differences between the species, but it would take a weighty argu- ment - and a difficult one to make in view of the evolutionary and physiological evidences - to show that these differences are absolute. To return once more to the question of God, it is clear that the issue depends here, too, on the extent to which the vast differences between God and man are not merely vast but literally without any foothold for comparison. This extreme position may indeed be claimed - as we saw it was claimed by Maimonides and Kierkegaard - but such claims can be sustained only at an immensely high price for philosophy and - as we also have seen - for religion itself. Many aspects of human personality are doubtless objectionable if attributed to the divine, but must that include as objectionable every aspect of human personality, including thinking, planning, loving, willing, and the like? As Midgley concludes, The argument which I have just criticized says that it must do so, simply because personality, emotion and so forth are human. But this means ruling that God - and indeed all non-human life - must be so unlike us that none of it can be understood from a human standpoint at all. This seems to be an arbitrary, groundless dogma.22</page><page sequence="9">211 If religion is to mean anything to human devotees, the supreme focus of their worship must not be beyond representation as supremely worthy, and for this the highest and most valud traits known to the religious community need to be in- voked on pain of spiritual emptiness and triviality. If, likewise, the concept of God is to be theoretically important for theologians and philosophers, God must be somehow in relation to all else, on pain of utter irrelevance. This does not make God less holy or awesome. On the contrary, it makes possible the positive affirma- tion of "holiness" and specification of those other traits that make for legitimate awe. Human language cannot deal absolutely with absolutes. To this extent humans must realize that when they speak of God's "absolute" knowledge or power or perfection, they do not speak literally or with full understanding. We know what power means in human contexts and then we take it as a conceptual model to refer upward, either indefinitely (if we are simply at worship), or until our metaphysical theories interpret the concept for us in its various theoretical relationships (if we are also attempting to think critically in connection with our highest values). As William Paley pointed out, "Omnipotence," "omniscience," "infinite" power, "infinite" knowledge are superlatives expressing our conception of these attributes in the strongest and most elevated terms which language supplies. We ascribe power to the Deity under the name of "omnipotence," the strict and correct conclusion being that a power which could create such a world as this is must be, beyond all comparison, greater than any which we experience in ourselves, than any which we observe in other visible agents, greater also than any which we can want, for our individual protection and preservation, in the Being upon whom we depend.23 We should realize, thus, that one more religious use of language is equally a "super- lative," and is more properly to be taken as a poetical compliment to God than as strictly meant: this is the uncautious claim, criticized in all the foregoing, that God is "absolutely" other, in all respects, from the rest of reality. It is fitting for an Isaiah to exult in the "incomparability" of Jehovah; it is, however, destruction of faith and of thought for others to overinterpret this poetic superlative and treat it as a logical doctrine. Humanly understandable qualities, in the last analysis, ...are the fire, the vital breath, the oxygen, the salt of existence. An existence in general, an existence without qualities, is an insipidity, an absurdity.... Only where man loses his taste for religion, and thus religion itself becomes insipid, does the existence of God become an insipid existence - an existence without qualities.24</page><page sequence="10">212 NOTES 1.
