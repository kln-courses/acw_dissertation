<plain_text><page sequence="1">Romance Languages 487 DUECENTO AND TRECENTO I DANTE By Donna L. Yowell, Assistant Professor 0f Italian, University of Washington, Seattle 1. General Though D.'s remains appeared to be in some jeopardy this year, D. studies continued to flourish on both sides of the big pond, with perhaps the most noteworthy sign of their current vitality in the continuing good health of the recently resurrected DaSt, the oldest and one of the most prestigious American scholarly journals in the field. After several years of inactivity, the presses turned out a second issue in 1987 and two in 1988, along with a pledge to recover completely from past delays by 1991. Yet another new periodical, Lectura Dantis New berry ana, ed. Paolo Cherchi and Antonio Mastro buono, Chicago, Northwestern U.P. (hereafter LDanN), joins the growing ranks of studies devoted to D. Promising multi-disciplinary interpretations, it will focus not on single cantos but on problems and themes, and will be published biannually. Details of its contents are given separately below. Dante e la Bibbia, ed. Giovanni Barblan, F, Olschki, 370 pp., is an impressive collection of 20 articles on various topics relating to D. and the Bible, delivered in Florence in September 1986, by a number of illustrious scholars attending an international conference promoted by 'Biblia'. Though, regrettably, limited space permits only a listing of the contents, the work in its entirety is heartily recommended for all students and scholars of D.: C. Vasoli, 'La Bibbia nel Convivio e nella Monarchic; J. Freccero, Tronia e mimesi: il disdegno di Guido'; M. E. Artom, 'Precedenti biblici e talmudici del contrapasso'; P. Boitani, 'Kenelm Foster: la mente innamorata'; P. Dronke, 'L'Apocalisse negli ultimi canti del Purgatorio'; G. Mazzotta, 'Teologia ed esegesi biblica (Par. iii-v)'; R. Jacoff, 'Dante, Geremia e la problematica profetica'; M. Adinolfi, T personaggi neotestamen tari nella Divina Commedia'; P. Armour, 'L'Apocalisse nel canto xxix del Purgatorio'; G. Cremascoli, 'Allegoria e dialettica: sul travaglio dell'esegesi biblica al tempo di Dante'; F. Mazzoni, 'Un incontro di Dante con l'esegesi biblica'; J. Ferrante, 'Usi e abusi della Bibbia nella letteratura medievale'; M. M. Chiarenza, 'Legato con amore in un volume'; G. Petrocchi, 'San Paolo in Dante'; A. C. Leonardi, '"Le bianche stole": il tema della resurrezione nel Paradiso';]. T. Schnapp, 'Trasfigurazione e metamorfosi nel Paradiso dantesco'; L. B. Ricci, 'Scrittura sacra e "Sacrato Poema"'; G. Gorni, 'Parodia e scrittura in Dante'; D. De Robertis, Tl caso di Cavalcanti'; P. S. Hawkins,</page><page sequence="2">488 Italian Studies 'Virgilio cita le Scritture'. Ruggiero Stefanelli, Dante: net mezzo del cammin di nostra lingua, Bari, Adriatica, 1986, 151 pp., traces the development of D.'s linguistic theories as expressed in PWand Purg., xxiv and xxvi. I. Toppani, 'Dante e la letteratura Greca', Atene e Roma, 33:27-36, summarizes earlier studies on D.'s scanty knowledge of Greek and argues for a mythological, legendary importance of Greek poetry to the poet whose debt to Greek philosophy has been more readily acknowledged. M. Trovato, 'Dante and the tradition of the "two beatitudes'", LDanN, 1:19-36, 'examines the teleological theory as interpreted by early medieval philosophers, by the Aristotelians of the Faculty of Arts, and by the commentators on Aristotle's Ethics at the end of the thirteenth century', in order to explore 'the ways in which Dante's writing reflects his acceptance of the conclusions reached by philosophers on the question of human beatitude'. 2. Fortuna On the basis of a meticulous and methodologically sound comparative study of the linguistic-syntactic-rhythmic similarities between the Maesta terzine and D.'s own, F. Brugnolo, 'Le terzine della Maesta di Simone Martini e la prima diffusione della Commedia\ MedRom, 12:135-54, suggests that the poetic inscription on the fresco in the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena is evidence of an early diffusion (slightly earlier than that generally accepted for the Purg.) and immediate popularity of the first two canticles. This year saw the publication of Bernardo Daniello's commentary, * L'espositione di Bernardino Daniello da Lucca sopra la Comedia de Dante, ed. Robert Hollander et at., Hanover, New England U.P., 520 pp. R. Hollander, 'A checklist of commentators on the Commedia (1322-1982)', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987): 181-92, provides a chronological listing of 130 commentaries along with useful bibliographical information. E. G. Caserta, 'Gli studi danteschi di Rocco Montano', ib., 145-66, assesses M.'s polemical, sometimes seminal, but often overlooked contribu tions to the field of D. studies. G. Stentella, Tl dantismo de Fedele Romani', CLett, 14, 1986:789-805, places this DeSanctian critic into an historical framework and provides a brief review of his primarily aesthetic-psychological brand of criticism. L. Sebastio and R. Stefanelli, 'Aldo Vallone "Dantista"', LDan, 3:3-10, 'indicate the salient moments of Vallone's critical contributions' which span 40 years and include the entire spectrum of D. scholarship. comparative studies. The growing interest in iconographically oriented approaches to the DC is matched by what appears to be an increasing number of studies on D. and the figurative arts, many of</page><page sequence="3">Duecento and Trecento I 489 which, however, are addressed primarily to the student of art, rather than the student of literature. J. P. Barricelli, 'The conscious and the subconscious: Rauschenberg and Dali face Dante', CLS, 24, 1987:353-69, compares the earthly and moral focus of R.'s drawings of Inf. with the 'oneiric treatment' and visionary nature of Dali's modernization of the DC to reflect the artists' different inspirational forces and philosophical conceptions of Hell. D. Fuller, 'Blake and Dante', Art History, 111349-73, disagrees with modern scholarship which sees B.'s illustrations of the DC as highly interpretative criticisms deriving from the artist's own symbolism and mythology, claiming instead that B.'s designs are for the most part literal renderings of D.'s text with additions from Scriptural context. J. Saltz, 'Every picture tells a story: one of Rauschenberg's 34 illustra tions for Dante's Inferno', Arts Magazine, 63, no. 3:19-22, provides a straightforward image by image explanation of R.'s drawing of Inf. xxxm for those presumably unfamiliar with the poem; of some interest is the description of R.'s visual rendering of those sinners whose bodily shells walk the earth while their souls suffer the torments of hell. J. B. Holloway, 'Chancery and comedy: Brunetto Latini and Dante Alighieri', LDan, 3:73-94, describes seven chan cery documents penned by B.L., more interesting as historical artifacts than as interpretative keys to the DC; H. concludes her study with interesting hypotheses about the poem and the notorial tradi tion. S. Botterill, 'Re-reading Lancelot: Dante, Chaucer, and Le Chevalier de la Charrette', PQ, 67:279-89, examines 'Chaucer's re writing' and the 'Monk's re-reading' of the Ugolino story and points out an analogous instance of the imprisonment-in-a-tower motif from I2th-c. France. S. Ellis, 'Chaucer, Dante, and damnation', Chaucer Review, 22:282-94, is a reading of the House of Fame 'which, beginning with the "test-case" of Dido, sees the poem as a satire on what one might call Dante's procedures of damnation and on his Virgilianism'. C. C. Breen, 'Proust, Dante, and Vergil: an incident of intertextuality along the Vivionne', CML, 9: 73-78, locates references to the Inf. and Aeneid in a passage of Proust's Swann's Way. R. A. Day, 'Dante, Ibsen, Joyce, Epiphanies, and the art of memory', JJQ, 25:357-62, suggests D. 's attention to specificity among the likely sources for the emphasis on 'quidditas' as 'claritas' in J.'s epiphanies. P. L. Hays, 'Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Dante's Vita Nuova', Explicator, 46, no. 4:49-50, is a delightfully brief and provocative piece on illusions to the young D.'s love for Beatrice in McMurphy's commitment to salvation and in his 'caritas masquerading as eros'. J. Thiem, 'Borges, Dante, and the poetics of total vision', CL, 40, no. 2:97-121, examines B.'s reluctance to acknowledge D. as his source in 'The Aleph' despite numerous parallels and obvious allusions. Citing both</page><page sequence="4">490 Italian Studies Bloom's concept of poetic anxiety and Borges's own pronouncements on literary influence, T. concludes that 'through the example of his own tale the author of "The Aleph" has sought to define a modern poetics of total vision based on significant omission'. 3. Textual Tradition There continues to be nothing to hand in this category. 4. Minor Works An increase in the amount of scholarly attention given the so-called minors is encouraging. V. Branca, 'Poetics of renewal and hagio graphic tradition in the Vita Nuova', LDanN, 1:123-52, approaches the VN as a 'legend of St Beatrice' firmly grounded in medieval hagiography; the translation is choppy, at best. P. Hainsworth, 'Cavalcanti in the Vita Nuova', MLR, 83:586-90, proposes an alternative interpretation (one which he claims is more justifiable linguistically and stylistically) to what has traditionally been regarded as the 'dedication' of the 'libello' to Cavalcanti in VN, xxx. 3. Robert Pogue Harrison, The Body of Beatrice, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins U.P., 207 pp., is an intriguing and welcome new study of VN which moves beyond the work of Singleton and De Robertis and whose primary and laudable aim is to consider the work 'on its own terms' rather than as a proem to the DC. Particularly noteworthy is H.'s treatment of figurative representation in the VN; contains analyses of the poetry of Cavalcanti and Petrarch, and an epilogue on Ezra Pound. J. B. Holloway, 'The Vita nuova: paradigms of pilgrimage', DaSt, 103, 1985 (1988): 103-24, discusses the two major paradigms of Judaeo-Christian pilgrimage used in medieval literary texts (the Emmaus and the Exodus patterns) and demonstrates the ways in which 'Hebraic pilgrimages liturgically, archeologically, inform the later Christian ones, all of these shaping the Vita nuova as well as other major pilgrimage texts'. F. Sanguined, 'Un proemio anticavalcan tiano', Letteratura fra centro e periferia. Studi in memoria di Pasquale Alberto DeLisio, ed. G. Paparelli and S. Martelli, Naples, ESI, 1987:27-37, *s a study of dissimulation in VN, the aim of whose poetry or 'bella menzogna' is to hide the truth, to cite from the book of memory in order to forget the traumatic event that determines it as text. S. sees the epilogue as a dissimulated condemnation of cavalcantian dis course. G. Tassinari, 'Metalingua e metadiscorso: prospettive sulla base di un'analisi della Vita Nuova di Dante', LS, 23: 71-94, discusses and defines the notions of metalanguage and metadiscourse and then applies them in her analysis of VN, 'un esempio precocissimo di</page><page sequence="5">Duecento and Trecento I 491 letteratura che si fa metaletteratura'. M. De Bonfils Templar, 'La "donna gentile" del Convivio e il boeziano mito d'Orfeo', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987): 123-44, sees tne polysemous Beatrice of the DC as a conflation of the allegorized 'donna gentile5 of both Cvio and VN, and relates the 'donna gentile' episode in the latter to Boethius's presentation of the Orpheus myth in De Consolatione Philosophiae. M. De Bonfils Templer, Tl dantesco "Amoroso Uso di Sapienza": sue radici platoniche', SIR, 7, 1987:5-27, cogently argues that in its title, in its doctrine (in particular, that of angeology, the generation of the soul, the concept of philosophy as 'the mother of all virtues') and in its platonic terminology, D.'s philosophical treatise contains references and echoes, indirectly derived, of Plato's Convito. L. Peterman, 'Reading the Convivio', DaSt, 103, 1985 (1988): 125-38, underscores certain of the ways in which the Cvio employs numerical patterns. A. Fratta, 'Discussioni esegetiche sul I libro del De vulgari eloquential, MedRom, 13:39-54, is an acute and suggestive reinterpretation of certain key concepts in the first book. M. Tavoni, 'Contributo al l'-interpretazione di De vulgari eloquentia 11-9', RLettI, 5, 1987:385 453, is a thoughtful and painstaking analysis whose primary contri bution is a re-evaluation of D.'s linguistic terminology. Arguing against the claim made by both Marigo and Mengaldo that D. used terms interchangeably and without precision or differentiation, T. closely examines the context and sequence in which these terms appear to reveal a precise system of terminology. Among the articles in Katharina Comoth, Mediaevalia Moderna, Heidelberg, Winter, 64 pp., is 'Pax universalis: Philosophic und Politik in Dantes Monarchia', which focuses on concepts of unity and harmony in the political sphere. H. A. Kelly, 'Dating the accessus section of the pseudo-dantean Epistle to Cangrande', LDan, 2:93-102, attempts to reignite the debate over the authenticity of the letter. Basing his argument on a sentence from Boccaccio's Italian commentary, K. claims, in fairly convoluted fashion, that the accessus (paras 5-16) and the exposition (paras 17-33) are not by D. and that the accessus in its original form was not penned by the compiler posing as D. It is safe to suggest that K.'s argument will not convince otherwise those who believe in the letter's authenticity. S. Botterill, ' "Quae non licet homini loqui": the ineffability of mystical experience in Paradiso 1 and the Epistle to Can Grande', MLR, 83:332-41, deals not with the spurious issue of the letter's authorship but with its content, in particular the references, biblical (Corinthians, Matthew, Ezekiel) and non-biblical (Richard of St Victor, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Augustine), cited in support of the 'theologically and linguistically audacious evocation of sublime experience in Paradiso', which, B. concludes, are connected to the issue of ineffability, both in proclaim ing it and in going beyond it.</page><page sequence="6">492 Italian Studies 5. Divine Comedy S. Adams, ' "Ut pictura poesis": the aesthetics of motion in pictorial narrative and the Divine Comedy1, SIR, 7, 1987:77-94, considers D.'s pronouncement on the art of the miniaturists in Purg., xi as part of an elaborate pattern of visible speech in the text, and in its relation to the 'painterly discourse' in Purg., xxxn, as both 'speak for the underlying poetics of the Commedia'.J. Ahern, 'Dante's last word: the Comedy as a liber coelestis', DaSt, 102, 1984 (1988): 1-14, ingeniously suggests that, in addition to the already established reasons, D. concludes each canticle with 'stelle' to discourage scribal tampering with the manuscript and to combine the metaphor of the book of the heavens and that of the alphabet of stars, thereby asserting, once again, the sacred origin of his text. W. Anderson, 'The central man of all the world', Parabola, 13:8-17, adapted from Dante the Maker, London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1980, discusses the ways in which the 'psychic energy' of the DC is transmitted to the reader. K. Brownlee, 'Phaeton's fall and Dante's ascent', DaSt, 102, 1984 (1988): 135-44, demonstrates the way in which references in the DC to Ovid's Phaeton 'function collectively as a program' to 'highlight the presentation of Dante's journey upward as a succession of guided stages'. D. A. Carozza, 'The motif of maturation in the Commedia\ LDanN, 1:57-70, traces through the three canticles the leitmotif of maturation, most often expressed in the contrast of words like acerbo/maturo. Giuseppe Godenzi, Manifestazioni e considerazioni delta morte nella Divina Commedia, F, Firenze Libri, 1986, 166 pp., is a curious study of the theme of death in the DC. While scholars will find G.'s comments and brief essays rather vague and banal, and his conclusion ? that the DC can be considered a Christian poem 'perche mostra la vita dopo la morte, e la mostra in azione, con grande sicurezza' ? foregone, certain of the various tables and lists of associated terms and their appearance in the poem, as well as in other vernacular and classical works, may prove useful. N. Iliescu, 'The roman emperors in The Divine Comedy', LDanN, 1:3-18, claims that D. exalts the figures of the emperors, based not on 'considerations of a historical-moral nature', but 'as instruments of a providential motus, intent on conducting history along the path which from the human leads to the divine'. E. Mallin, 'The false simile in Dante's Commedia', DaSt, 102, 1984 (1988): 15-36, redefines the pseudosimile as a 'rhetorical representation of consciousness', and compares the absence of a clear resemblance or correspondence between tenor and vehicle in this rhetorical device to the limited vision and confusion that the pilgrim suffers in iter. A. C. Mastrobuono, 'The powerful enigma', LDanN, 1:153-98, is an elaborate interpretation of the</page><page sequence="7">Duecento and Trecento I 493 'cinquecento diece e cinque' which supports M.'s earlier argument that the Veltro be 'interpreted as Christ in His First Advent'. P. Shaw, 'A parallel structure for the Divina Commedia', SIR, 7, 1987:67-76, proposes an oversimplified schema of themes or significant elements that thematically tie the corresponding cantos of each canticle. M. U. Sowell, 'A bibliography of the Dantean simile to 1981', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987): 167-80, lists 147 works from 1707 to 1981 which deal with D.'s use of the simile and encourages further study of this rhetorical figure. Jeremy Tambling, Dante and Difference: Writing in the Commedia, CUP, 206 pp., is admirable, though not unique, in its attempt to apply modern critical theories of hermeneutics to D.'s poem; it unfortunately does justice to neither. INFERNO The Inf. remains by far the most popular and fertile realm for D. scholars. A. Cornish,' "Quali i fioretti": Euryalus, Hyacinth, and the pilgrim', SIR, 7, 1987:205-15, proposes similes of the dying flower in the Aeneid and the Metamorphosis as classical antecedents for the simile in Inf., 11, the latter functioning as an image of resurrection, the former employed in reference to the earthly immortality of untimely deaths. C. proceeds to explore the ways in which this early flower simile in Inf. 'expands in its resonance and meaning' throughout the poem. M. Aeschliman, 'The heirs of canto m of Dante's Inferno', LDan, 2:5-14, departs from D.'s description of the 'genti dolorose' to launch a sociological commentary on the hopelessness of contemporary cul ture and its waning religious spirit, as evidenced in the words of modern poets, sociologists, and philosophers. M. de Bonfils Templer, 'Elisio e Tartaro nelPInferno dantesco (Pegaso e Medusa)', DaSt, 102, 1984 (1988): 37-49, considers the ways in which D.'s antithetical representations of Dis (Inf. vn) and of Limbo (Inf. iv) reciprocally gloss one another, and discusses the pagan and Christian significance of the Medusa figure. R. Fleming, 'Francesca's sweet new subversive style', LDan, 3:11-22, concludes that 'Francesca's adoption of the sweet new style is, from the view of conventional, i.e., male-imposed, morality, subversive in the extreme because it calls into doubt that same morality by adopting the vocabulary of poetry, the sweet new style, whose primary concerns are ethical, yet such literary speech now refuses to recognize those patriarchal categories and prohibitions with even so much as a perfunctory glance'(?). B. Vinken, 'Encore: Francesca da Rimini ? rhetoric of seduction ? seduction of rhetoric', DVLG, 62:395-415, summarizes 'romantic' and 'modern ist' readings of the overworked episode while contributing little that is new. B. Marsiglia, 'Rileggendo i canti vn e vm dell' Inferno:</page><page sequence="8">494 Italian Studies osservazioni e ipotesi su "quei de la palude pingue"LItal, 40:378? 86, citing passages from Aquinas's .STand Aristotle's Etica, identifies the 'tristi' immersed in the mire of Styx in the fifth circle as the 'invidiosi' and 'accidiosi5, while those besmirched are the 'iracondi' and 'superbi'. C. Kleinhenz, 'Inferno 8: the passage across the Styx', LDan, 3:23-40, discusses the canto's 'structure of pause-movement pause' and offers insights into 'the problem of righteous anger which controls the dramatic tension in this episode'. H. A. Mason, 'A journey through Hell: Dante's Inferno revisited', Cambridge Quarterly, 17:28-56 and 126-55, laments the fact that D. is not Homer. G. Cambon, 'Lectura dantis: Inferno x', LDan, 2:15-29, focuses on the first half of the canto and contains a cogent rhetorical-rhythmic analysis of certain passages. F. Rosengarten, 'Gramsci's "Little Discovery": Gramsci's interpretation of canto x of Dante's Inferno', Boundary, 14, 1986, no. 3:71-90, uses biographical information gleaned from his letters to suggest that G.'s imprisonment illumin ated levels of meaning and contributed to his anti-Crocean interpre tation of the episode. The exact dating of Guido Cavalcanti's death on 29 August 1300, together with Farinata's statements on the sinners' perception of time, encouraged Gramsci to locate the dramatic centre of the episode in the doubt and anguish which torment the father, ignorant of his son's imminent present. S. Botterill, 'The form of Dante's minotaur', Fol, 22:60-76, cites numerous descriptions of the minotaur from both traditional and medieval texts and privileges the depiction of the bull-headed man in Ovid's Heroides, x, as a possible source for D., while acknowledging the early manuscript illustrators' preference for the human-headed image. V. Cioffari, 'Inferno xm from Laurentian Pluteo 40.2 and its sources', Z)&amp;SV, 101, 1983 (1987): 1-25, publishes his transcription of the Laurentian Plut. 40.2 text and accompanying commentaries (primarily those of Benvenuto da Imola and Guido da Pisa) for Inf. xm, a key canto in determining chronological sequence of the commentaries. J. Harris contributes three notes to LDan, 2:73?92, the most provocative of which, 'Brunetto the sodomite', suggests that D. portrays Brunetto as a 'homosexual man with characteristically, even stereotypically, gay attributes and mannerisms'. P. Cerchi, 'Geryon's canto', ib., 31-44, fails in his overly ambitious attempt to present Inf. xvn as 'one of the most memorable cantos of the entire Comedy, but very ably under scores the poetic skill demonstrated in the representation of Geryon's flight. Though C.'s discussion of the canto's dominant rhetorical features is at times forced, it contains intriguing comments about their effects on the canto. R. Kay, 'The spare ribs of Dante's Michael Scot', DaSt, 103, 1985 (i988):i-i4, cites passages in Scot's Liber physiognomiae to explain the detailed reference in Inf., xx. 115-17, to</page><page sequence="9">Duecento and Trecento I 495 the leanness of Michael's flanks. J. Falvo, 'The irony of deception in Malebolge: Inferno xxi-xxm', LDan, 2:55-72, examines the theme of deception, farce as the device employed in treating this theme, and the relation of these to the nature of comedy as truth and/or deception, claiming, in addition, that at the centre of Malebolge Dante stages 'the two most important events in Salvation History: Man's Fall and Redemption'. R. Hollander, '"Ad ira parea mosso": God's voice in the garden (Inf. xxiv, 69)', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987): 27-49, argues for a restoration of the 'ancient reading' of verse 69 based on a close examination of the text and its biblical dimensions. DaSt, 102, 1984 (1988) contains a cluster of essays on Inf., xxiv, and the episode of the thieves. R. J. Ellrich, 'Envy, identity, and creativity: Inferno xxiv-xxv' (61?80), is an eloquent and expansive study which 'proposes that the design of meaning in Cantos xxiv-xxv is organized around Dante's perception of theft as a movement of envy whose consequences are the negation of identity and creativity', and offers another interpretation of D.'s boasting of poetic superiority. J. T. Chiampi, 'The fate of writing: the punishment of thieves in the Inferno' (51-60), studies the episode in relation to others in the poem as an example of the way in which 'Dante uses writing as a metaphor to join his poetic act to the process of spiritual reformation', and compares the 'scriptural' fate of the thieves (portrayed as letters that do not reveal meaning) to the 'scriptural' fate of the blessed which conform perfectly to the Word. Both M. Frankel, 'Dante's anti-Virgilian villanello (Inf. xxiv, 1-21)' (81-109), and R- Hollander, 'Dante's "Georgic" (Inferno xxiv, 1?18)', (111?21), treat the lengthy and puzzling simile which opens the episode of the thieves. F. claims to discern in the simile clues to understanding 'Dante's evolving conception of Virgil as a character in the Commedia', the nature of the sin for which Dante has relegated Virgil to hell; Dante's succeeding stages in his understanding of the Aeneid; his own intention of writing the Commedia as an anti-Aeneid.' H., following Pietro di Dante, points out an echo of Virgil's Georgic in the simile which he views as a 'Christian vernacularization "in modo remisso et humile" of a Virgilian georgic'. J. Harris, 'Guido's portrait (Inferno xxvn)', LDan, 2:73-92, is a brief comment on 'Dante's art of portraiture' which contrasts the heroic elements of Ulysses's character with the self dramatizing self-pity that characterize Guido da Montefeltro. R. P. Harrison, 'Comedy and modernity: Dante's Hell', MLN, 102, 1987:1043-61, though it at times overstates to support its claims (it is Diomedes, not Guido, who is paired with Ulysses, for example), is a suggestive study of the episode of Guido da Montefeltro as 'Dante's broad critique of the modern era', which also manages to make insightful contributions to the much overworked 26th canto. M.</page><page sequence="10">496 Italian Studies Parker, 'Lectura dantis: Inferno xxvm', LDan, 3:41-50, explores notions of cleavage, separation, and dispersal in the canto, alongside the 'unseen recombinations of poetic and bodily integrity'. D. Heilbronn, 'Master Adam and the fat-bellied lute (Inf. xxx)', DaSt, 101,1983 (1987): 51-65, is a well-documented study of'the lute simile and its inherent musical symbolism'. S. J. Patti, 'Inferno xxxi', LDan, 2:45-54, notes 'the emphasis that Dante's poetry places on the idea of clear perception'. D. Cervigni, 'Dante's Lucifer: the denial of the Word', ib., 3:51-62, focuses on the perversion of Christological imagery in the final canto of Inf., in particular, the parody of Christ, the Word, in the eternal silence of Lucifer. S. Spence, 'Myrrha, Myrrha in the well: metonymy and interpretation in Inferno xxxiv', DaSt, 103, 1985 (1988): 15-36, draws on iconographic representa tions to argue that D.'s description of Lucifer 'refers specifically, and in an other-than-allegorical way, to a well-established and equally well-suppressed narrative that connects Mary with the taboo figure of Myrrha'. PURGATORY J. C. Barnes, 'Liturgical schemes in Dante's PurgatorioT, in Brown Vol., pp. 1-16, argues convincingly against recent theories which have posited liturgical elements as a controlling structural basis for the Purg. While acknowledging patterns of liturgical derivation in the canticle and aptly demonstrating one such pattern in the episode of the Valley of the Princes, B. sensibly discourages the imposition of rigid schemes on a poem characterized by its flexible use of sources for its own poetic ends. A. Levitan, 'Dante as listener, Cato's rebuke, and Virgil's self-reproach', DaSt, 103, 1985 (1988): 37-55, points to two passages in the Aeneid as the frames of allusion in D.'s encounter with Casella in Purg., 11. D. Pietropaolo, 'The figural context of Buon conte's salvation', ib., 102, 1984 (1988): 123-34, establishes the figural context for the dispute between angel and devil over the body of Buonconte in the Epistle of Jude, and thereby claims to render the episode more substantial and more significant by linking it typolo gically 'to the death and assumption of Moses, to the inheritance of Moses' role by Joshua, and to this final succession by Jesus'. A. Scaglione, 'Dialectic composition in Purgatorio v', LDan, 3:63-72, is a thorough and traditional lectura which manages to offer some new insights. N. J. Vickers, 'Seeing is believing: Gregory, Trajan, and Dante's art', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987) :67~85, proposes interesting scriptural and iconographic subtexts for the Trajan/Gregory story in Purg., x. 73-93. C. Kleinhenz, 'Virgil, Statius, and Dante: an unusual trinity', LDanN, 1:37-55, investigates Statius's role in the poem as</page><page sequence="11">Duecento and Trecento I 497 'the poet of civic harmony and political order', discusses the 'political and prophetic dimensions' of these cantos, and considers the recurrence here and elsewhere of two 'parole possibilmente politiche'. W. Wetherbee, 'Dante and the Theb aid ofStditim\ ib., 71-92, attempts to explain the Roman poet's significant role in the poem 'in terms of Statius's own poetry'. G. Sansone, 'Varia ermeneutica di Purgatorio xxvi', MedRom, 13:55-74, a primarily structural analysis of the canto, it underscores its pervasive binary oppositions, and is worthwhile, in particular, for its discussion of the variant readings of verse 146 of Arnaut's monologue (S. convincingly defends the 'escalina' reading over the recently suggested 'calina'). C. A. Cioffi, "Tl canto de' bucolici carmi": the influence of Virgilian pastoral on Dante's depiction of the Earthly Paradise', LDanN, 1:93-122, is a methodical and informative attempt to demonstrate that D.'s depiction of Eden as 'a place of radical ambiguity' derives much from Virgil's own pastoral vision. PARADISO The third canticle continues to become ever more popular, with the number of studies devoted to the realm this year exceeding (for the first time ever?) those dedicated to the Purg. G. Muresu, 'Dante tra ragione e intelletto (Par. 11)', RLI, 91, 1987:5-23, considers Beatrice's discourse on the moon spots a 'spostamento della prospettiva metodologica' and an appeal to the intuitive-intellective faculty necessary for the remainder of the journey. M. also speculates on D.'s understanding and representation of Aquinas's distinction between 'intellectus' and 'ratio'. G. Oliva, 'Paradiso v: codici culturali sulla questione dei voti', REI, 33, 1987:9-18, at times rich, at times incohesive study of the question of vows in Par. v, which notes the mercantile language employed in the canto and explores the rapport between 'misura commerciale e mondo religioso-morale' in D.'s text and in its socio-historical context. T. Barolini, 'Dante's heaven of the sun as a meditation on narrative', LItat, 40:3-36, is a fascinating study of the 'nature and constraints of narrative' as demonstrated in the narratives or 'Saints' Lives' recounted by Thomas and Bonaven ture in cantos xi and xn, and the ways in which these issues relate to D.'s own representational task of narrating paradise. In discussing the canticle's 'tension regarding multiplicity', B. announces a forthcoming metatextual study 'that will approach the Paradiso by using piu, meno, differenza, differente, etal. as "markers of differences"'. R. S. Beal, 'Beatrice in the sun: a vision from Apocalypse', DaSt, 103, l9&amp;5 (1988): 57?78, argues that 'the primary vision of Canto x is based on a Biblical "magnum signum", that is of Beatrice as the</page><page sequence="12">498 Italian Studies "mulier amicta sole", the woman in the sun described in Apocalypse 12'. E. Bonora, 'Di Fra Tommaso il discreto latino (sulla lingua del canto di san Francisco)', GSLI, 164:161-80, not always coherent or convincing in his consideration of the narrative material, treats the 'rigorous order' and the abundance of latinisms (classical, New Testament, scholastic, and hagiographic) with which Thomas enno bles his homily to Francis. J. Harris, 'La gloriosa rota (Paradiso x)', LDan, 2:88-92, is a brief study of the Boethian clock image from De Consolatione through VN to Par., x, which includes an acute and sensitive reading of the canto's closing lines. G. Muresu,' "La gloria della carne": disfacimento e trasfigurazione (Par. xiv)', RLI, 91, 1987:253-68, challenges the overly simplified amalgamation of Aquinas's position on the nature of the body after the resurrection to D.'s luministic representation of the souls in Paradise, thereby re-enforcing the claim that D. tended to avoid anthropomorphism in the third canticle. G. Petrocchi, Tl canto xvm del Paradiso', CLett, 16:3-11, sees the canto's bipartite structure as reflecting the poet as exile and as prophet. Both A. Battistini, '"Se la Scrittura sovra voi non fosse . . .": allusioni bibliche nel canto xix del Paradiso', CLett, 16:211-35, and V. Russo, 'Paradiso xix: "similis fictio numquam facta fuit per aliquem poetam"', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1988):87-110, examine the central issues of divine and human justice in Par., xix. K. Taylor, 'From "superbo Ilion" to "umile Italia": the acrostic of Paradiso 19', SIR, 7, 1987 ^7-65, asserting that the standard interpre tation of the acrostic in Par., xix 'does not fully satisfy' since it ought to do more than 'merely make sense', adds the 'lettere mozze' (i, m) of Par., xix to the trunk of the VOM acrostic in Purg., xn, and rearranges the order of the mutilated letters to yield 'umile'. This imperfect way of writing, distinct from God's writing, is, T. claims, a sign of the poet's own humility. J. Madaule,' "Le fol outrepas d'Ulysse": Dante, Paradis, xxvn, 82?83', Corps ecrit, 27:121-28, uses the passage as a springboard for philosophical musings. R. Harring, 'Dante's allegory of mysticism in Paradiso xxx: a comparative analysis', Studia Mystica, 11:44-56, explores the extent to which D.'s journey coincides with the transcedent vision of other mystics by comparing the Beatific Vision of Par., xxx, with the experiences of three non-Christian mystics, culturally and temporally remote from D. A. L. Rossi, ' "Miro gurge" (Par. xxx, 68): Virgilian language and textual pattern in the river of light', DaSt, 103, 1985 (1988): 79-101, is a painstaking study of the double Latinism in the 'most conspicuously Latinizing canto of the Commedia". G. C. Di Scipio, 'The Hebrew women in Dante's symbolic rose', DaSt, 101, 1983 (1987): 111-21, explores the intentions behind D.'s opting for his own as opposed to the biblical ordering of the Hebrew women, all 'typi Ecclesiae', in the White Rose.</page></plain_text>
