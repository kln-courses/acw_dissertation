<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGES OF ANIMALS: ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND AN- IMAL MIND. Animals, Culture, and Society. By Eileen Crist. Philadelphia (Pennsylvania): Temple University Press. $34.95. xv 1 245 p; ill.; index. ISBN: 1-56639-656-5. 1999. The author critically reviews the observation lan- guage of historical contributors to the study of ani- mal behavior (Darwin, naturalists, ethologists, be- haviorists and sociobiologists). Crist's now familiar general premise is that no complete objectivity ex- ists. This premise is accompanied by two illogical corollaries: (1) to understand behavior we must de- scribe it in the everyday language of feelings, de- sires, and intentions, and (2) attempts at objectivity are misguided at best, and, at worst, have led to "our thoughtless and destructive relationship with the natural world" (p 222). The author leaves aside potentially interesting discussions of the possibility of a provisional objec- tivity, the value of limited anthropomorphism, the value of models, and whether one can take an ani- mal's view without turning it into a human one. Her critical omission, though, is a careful discussion of the usefulness of attributing to animals human thoughts, feelings and desires. The capacity to em- pathize appears an important and remarkably in- voluntary part of our social "tool-kit." Before chil- dren can talk, they appear to attribute feelings and intentions to objects. Even adults seem powerless to stop their own attributions of individual agency to plants, cars, computers and the government. Indi- vidual attributions seem wonderfully accurate in ex- plaining behavior after the fact, but our ability to agree on these attributions or to use them to predict behavior is frequently marginal, and decreases fur- ther in the case of unfamiliar people and cultures. It is not practice in attribution that improves our predictions, but experience with the relation be- tween stimulus conditions and resultant behavior, combined with a testable implicit or explicit model of underlying functional organization. It is easy to parody a scientist carefully avoiding words like "grief" or "sorrow" while describing the behavior of a chimpanzee mother carrying her dead child. But gathering such information is im- portant in finding out more about grief and sorrow, their time course and coherence, physiological sub- strate, differences among individuals, and role in social relations. By insisting on abandoning "mech- anomorphic" language like that of Tinbergen, the author abandons an important ground of agree- ment and analysis in favor of the comfort of familiar words. Anthropomorphism can contribute to the study of behavior, but alone it leads inevitably to the realm of human social relations, not to the realm of understanding behavior.
