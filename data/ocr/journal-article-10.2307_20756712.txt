<plain_text><page sequence="1">73 Notes on Sacred Laws 1. Argos The temple of Hera at Argos has yielded a bronze tablet of the sixth century B.C. inscribed with a law.1 The tablet is complete at top and bottom; as reconstructed by Jeffery, the text begins: 1 [at xioxk; xa y]pa0paxa xaSev h&lt;e&gt; ayvoi [he acpave] [aq rcoieoi] he ouyxeot, xaq apaq xaq [Hepac; ?] [mi xpexo ck] yaq xaq Apyeiaq (kxX.) K?rner modified this somewhat but retained the same sense, a curse for harming the tablet: [at xiGXiq xa y]pd0paxa xd5ev hayvox[axa2 xai Hepai] [he dcpavi^oi] he auy%eoi, xaq ?paq x?q [Hepag ?] [Kai xpexo ck] yaq xaq Apyeiag If anyone either erase or damage this text that is most sacred to Hera,... the curse of Hera and he is to be exiled from Argive territory. Jeffery's text was unargued; and K?rner was troubled that such a stipulation would come first in a document rather than last. But the mention of writings and a curse together in a conditional sentence supports Jeffery's sense of the whole, whatever might be the exact wording at the break of lines 1-2.3 To restore the end of line 2, Rogers already saw that the sense should be evo%o&lt;; "subject to" (so still Koerner), but no wording has been proposed. Caution is requisite, as the line length is a guess. But later texts point to the phrase that is needed here. In Roman Imperial times and later, we find imprecations phrased xdc; ?p?q/xr\v dpdv + genitive + e%eiv. Thus at Termessos, a grave monument threatens that any violator "will have the curses of the dead", e^ei x[a]q ?paq xcbv Kaxoi%opevcov (J. Strubbe, Arai epitymbioi 326). More often this sentiment is expressed in other ways, of which there are very many examples: e.g., again from Termessos, eva%e0r|oexai... dpaiq xai&lt;; siq xovq Kaxoi%opevoD&lt;;, "he will be held in the curses (sent) to the dead" (309); ei;ei npbq xovq Kaxoixopevouq ?paiq KaxaxOovioic; (328, dative for accusative).4 This is synonymous with evoxoq ... eaxai eiq xohq Kaxoixopevouq ?paq, "subject to a curse (sent) to the dead" (313, cf. 228). The phrase "have the curse(s) of" is also frequent in Christian curses - most often, invoking the curse of the 318 Fathers (of the Council of Nicaea):5 a funerary example is SEG XV 545 (Chios), ex(fl) xriv dpdv xov xiri' dr|o(v) rcax(epcov). It is also common in Byzantine monastic donations, e.g. 6 xouxo rcotcov exexco xtiv dpdv xcov xtr)' dyicov rcaxepcov.6 For some Christians blunt simplicity was enough: OiA,i7i7io[(;] mcxbq ev0d8e Kixe* ei xiq eKxpdvioq dvoi^ei, dpdv exexco, "may he have a curse".7 1 Published independently by J. D. Rogers, AJA 5,1901,159-174, and M. Fraenkel, IG IV 506; E. F. De Cou, in The Argive Heraeum II (1905) 333-336 no. 1826, pi. 106-107 [L. H. Jeffery, LSAG2 p. 405; R. Koerner, Gesetzestexte 29; H. van Effenterre and F. Ruze, Nomima 1100]. 2 The end of line 1,1 or T, reflects Rogers' text, whose drawing and (possibly) photograph show the lower half of a hasta; so too Kirchhoff's copy in IG. The superior drawing and photograph in Argive Heraeum show the bronze broken off after O, so too Fraenkel's copy in IG. 3 "Defacement" envisaged already by Rogers (164-165).

Philadelpheus, Deltion 6,1920/1, 124 no. 41 and fig. 18 [SEG III 208, where it is attributed to Athens and the third century A.D.]. The stone was found in Athens in a merchant's home with other antiquities. It is certainly later than III A.D., and to judge from maxoc,, likely from Thrace or Anatolia. The Latinism extranius is attested at Termessos (TAM III 481,541,608) and Thessalonica (P. M. Nigdelis, EmypdcpiKa QeooaXoviKew (Thessalonica 2006) 356-358, with commentary).</page><page sequence="2">74 K. J. Rigsby The verb 8%eiv is found in curses without dpd: thus tov Kpewovxa ^covraq Kai veKpouq 0?ov k8%oAcop8vov ?%oito (TAMY 1157, Thyateira), ?%?[tco] xr|v pepi5a tou 'Iou8a xov TcpoSoxou (IG IV 621, Argos). It could also serve in expressing the opposite sentiment: xXzcoq Saipovaq Kai Geouq navxaq ?%?Tco (IGLSyrie 1 1.232, Commagene). These instances are late; but the authors use the expression ap?q ?%?iv at an early date: so Aesch. Ag. 1413 SripoGpouq x' ?%?iv dpdq, Soph. Phil. 1120 oxuy?pdv ?%? 8uo7coTpov dpdv en' aXkoiq. And in archaic inscriptions, a penalty clause is common: ?v TTi7capf|i ?X?O0ai (M./L. 30.B.34, Teos); [r]Ti7tapfji e[v]exea9(D (Gesetzestexte 63, Chios); ?v i?7cidpoi k' ?V?%oito xoivraw' ?ypap?voi (Minon, I.Eleennes 10, cf. 22). These are good grounds to restore this verb in line 2 of the Argive law: xaq ?paq x?q \Hepaq ?%?to]; or if the name of Hera is rightly restored in line 1, then x?q [Qzaq ?%?io].8 He who damages the tablet is to "have the curses" of the goddess. To threaten the curses of Hera, however, raises a theological question. What is the force of the genitive: a curse uttered by the god or to the god? The same doubt affects a curse stipulated in Plato's legislation against those who do not come in aid against an abuser of a parent: "let him be held in a curse of Zeus", dpa ?v?%?o0a&gt; Axbq opoyvuro Kai Tiaxpcpou Kara vopov (Leg. 881d). We might think that gods have no need to curse or to pray, as they have the power to work their will. Humans curse, gods act.9 With the curses of the Nicene Fathers, there is no difficulty, for mortals call down curses, and the Fathers' utterance of a curse was on authoritative record. So also "the curse of Socrates" at Plut. Mor. 662b: a curse uttered by him, as is made explicit at SVFI 558. Admittedly, gods are occasionally described as issuing dpai - curses or prayers.10 So Hera herself in Hymn.Horn.Ap. 331-342: angry with Zeus, she prayed (xcoop?vr| ... fipdio) to Earth and Heaven and the Titans for a son who could oppose him, pressing her palm to the ground;11 and like an ordinary mortal, she was delighted when she saw that her request would actually be fulfilled (t?p7i?To ov Kaxd 0up6v, 6i?io yap t?^??O0ai). But this portrayal of divinity is exceptional, and can be attributed to the extreme anthropo morphism that characterizes this story - and perhaps to the particular character of Hera as neglected wife. Again, when Cronus curses his son Zeus for dethroning him (Aesch. PV 910), that too reflects a degree of anthropomorphism, in that Cronus, like a mortal, is now powerless to work his will. The "curses of the dead" raise this question also, though less pointedly. For the dead might be imagined to issue curses: Agamemnon and Clytemnestra both did so (Aesch. Cho. 912 Y?v?0?io\)&lt;; dpdq, cf. 924 925), and the dead Clytemnestra stirs up the Furies (Eum. 116 ?vap yap upa&lt;; v?v KAmaiprioxpa KaAco). A later lady, however, non-heroic and non-fictional, doubted whether this power was possessed by the dead (I.metr.Egypte 46.22 ei y' ?ot' ev ASod ?ai?q ex&gt;%(okr\q Aoyoq, "if there is even a weak word of prayer in Hades"). The fuller phrases in Anatolian epitaphs cited above show that ?^?i x?q ?paq x&amp;v Kaxoi%op?vcov is meant to imply the far more frequent "curses/prayers (sent) to the dead". Normally the vengeful dead haunt, in response to someone's curse,12 rather than themselves issuing a curse.13 8 Fraenkel rendered accusatives, x?q dpdg xaq-(also van Effenter re/Ruze); Rogers (also De Cou, K?rner) genitives, xaq dpdq xaq-; Jeffery's version, unaccented, is indeterminate. Rogers (167-168) held that in Doric the accusative article must be xavq. F. Bechtel, Die griechischen Dialekte II (Berlin 1923) 467, cited early Doric instances of acc. pi. xoq rather than xovq, but did not address this text. See however I.Cret. IV 41.vi.6 xaq xi\iavq (Gortyn, V B.C.), 184.13 xaq nevxe xitadSavc, (III/II). 9 On curses and consequent divine wrath see W. Speyer, RAC 7,1969, 1176-80. On the wide range of meaning of dpd, including personified Vengeance/Justice, see R. Vallois, BCH 38,1914,250-271, esp. 259-261. 10 Cf. Jul. Ep. 88 B-C xaq 8K Oecov dpdq, which the pious Julian deprecates (I owe the reference to Georg Petzl). 11 Hymn.Hom.Ap. 333, xetp't KOCToarpnvei 8' ekaaz x^ova. For this seemingly human gesture cf. Bacch. 5.42, and again Hera at //. 14.272, an anthropomorphic and comic scene (with her very human prayer at 232-241) later called Hera's Oath C'Hpac; ?pKoq, Paus. 8.37.5). 12 A locus classicus for the powers of the dead is Xen. Cyr. 8.7.18: the souls m^apvaioDc; xoiq dvoaioiq ercuieuTiouoi. Cf. F. Cumont, RendPontAcc 5,1926/7,69-73 [SEG VI 803; J.

Graf, ThesCRA III 247-270, esp. 261; R. Parker, Miasma (1982) 104-143.</page><page sequence="3">Notes on Sacred Laws 75 This then will be the meaning of "curses of Hera", and also of Plato's "curse of Zeus": a curse call ing upon, not pronounced by, the god.14 For nothing is more familiar than calling upon a particular god to carry out a curse; a sixth-century example is a Rhodian gravestone, Zei) 5e viv ooxiq 7cr||iawoi XexoXt] 6ei8, "may Zeus render ruined whoever damages this" (SEG XXVI 865); cf. in Roman Anatolia ?oxco K]axr|pa^?VO&lt;; vno x? Aia rf|v "H?uov, "let him be cursed and under (the power of) Zeus, Earth, Helios".15 A careful combination is sometimes seen in the medieval instances: ?%?xco xtjv opyriv xo? 7iavayd0ot&gt; 0(e)o\) k(ai) xo dvd0?|ua k(oci) x^v dpdv xfj&lt;; vn(epayiaq) 0(?ox6)kod kccI xcbv xir|' dyicov 7i(axep)cov, "may he have the wrath of all-good God and the condemnation and curse of the holy Theotokos and the 318 holy fathers".16 This is theologically rigorous: God can be angry, while Mary and the fathers can only curse - that is, invoke God's anger. There was not always such a clear distinction: a poet offers ?%?xa&gt; xr\v dpdv xou 7cdvxa 7toir|Gavxo&lt;; (Tzetzes CM. 3.156), where "the curse of the Almighty" might imply the same dubious theology as might curses "of" Hera or Zeus. But poets have licence to be abrupt and allusive. So do lawyers. Plato postulates a "curse of Zeus" that is stipulated by law, Kaxd vojiov: this suggests as background a legislated public formula calling down the god's wrath.17 The Argives' "curses of Hera", invoked in a document set up in her precinct, likewise implies an imprecation known to all, part of the official usage of the temple, and so easily referred to in brief form. 2. Lagina In the late fourth century B.C. cultic honors at Lagina were voted for the daimon of a benefactor named Leros.18 The opening lines present a number of difficulties; the editor gave: [Jo[-------..........] ooigx; Koc[i e\)oe?c?(;, 8e86x6av drco?] t&gt;eiv Kocxd 7ta[xpun)(; vojuoik; urcep auxco] 4 v, euepyexaq d[vaypd(p?iv auxouq Kai] iSpuoao?ai 8e ?co[|i6v Kai vaov? urcep %ox&gt;] Sai|uovo(; Aepco Kai [ 0t)] ?iv Aeovxa xov tepeia ?[pi(pov veov? Kai] 8 Kpi?v ?Kaaxoi) ?viai)xou, [Qveiv auxov] Kai Koaivaq* The text later makes it clear that Leros is the benefactor and still alive, and not the name of the daimon in line 6 (i.e., "the daimon of Leros", not "the daimon Leros"). Worship of the daimon of a living person is attested in other inscriptions from Caria.19 The adverbs in line 2 were probably introduced by 8iaK?i|i?v0d&lt;; vel sim.; they might describe either the honorands (Leros and his wife) or the group (city, deme, or private thiasos) that is honoring them. In 2-4, those establishing a new cult regime are not likely to invoke "ancestral laws", where also an article would be needed (as Chaniotis has seen, who suggests-vexv Kaxd 7ud[vxa). The phrase vnep aux?&gt;]v is otiose; while "inscribe them benefactors" is clumsy, and usually the place for inscribing would be stated. I propose instead that this provision of the decree was to "proclaim them as their benefactors at each festival", dvayop?]u?iv Kaxd 7ca[aav ?Opxriv (bq xovq ?auxa&gt;]v evepyexaq. For such a requirement see Peek, LDorJnseln 88.12 (p. 40) dvayop?D?xco Kax' ?Kaoxav awo8ov; SEG XLIX 1115.45 dvayop?t&gt;r|xai 14 Parker, Miasma 7 n. 29, rightly includes Plato's phrase in noting as parallel sentiments "held in the curse" and "held in the agos" of a god.

In line 5, 6e shows that a new provision of the decree begins here (and Kai is not to be restored in 4). The editor's restoration was tentative. The pair "altar and temple building" is a rarity in new foundations,20 and perhaps surprising inside of the precinct of Hecate. Chaniotis too judged vaov to be unlikely and restored Ka0]li8puoao0ai 8? ?co[pov vnep xov] Saipovoq ??pco. This however appears to be too short, and the preposition is unusual, an altar "in behalf of the daimon, rather than simply "of". Hence I pro pose: ?co[pov Kai x?p?Voq xou] Saipovoq ??pco. "Altar and precinct" were the material elements of many small or new cults - the phrase was common because it described a common fact, an altar in the open air on a bounded sacred plot. The pairing in describing a new cult-place is frequent from the beginnings of Greek literature: Horn.Hymn.Ap. 88 Ooi?o\) xfjSe 0uco8r|(; ?og?xai aid ?cop?q Kai x?p?vog; Bacch. fr.1.52 ?co]pov x? nu0a&lt;i&gt;?i kxio?[-Kai] x?p?Voq ?d0?ov; Hdt. 2.178 ?vi8puoao0ai ?copouq Kai x?p?v?a 0?Oiai, 3.142 ?copov i8puoaxo Kai x?p?voq; Callim. dieg. x.12 (p. 218 Pf.) ?cop?v Kai x?p?Vo&lt;; auxfjq Ka0i5puo0ai. In the inscriptions, e.g. IG II2 1338.9 ?copov iSpua[ap?vr| Kai] x?p?vo&lt;; KaxaoK?udaaoa, OGIS 6.20 dcpopioai awcoi x?p?vo&lt;; Kai ?copov rcofjoai21 The site apparently was within the great temple-precinct of Hecate, where the stele was found; no very substantial structure could be expected here for the daimon of Leros.22 This was a modest cultic gesture. It would be typical that such honor consisted of that least minimum apparatus of Greek religion, an altar on a demarcated plot of land. In line 6, Carbon reasonably took the wife to be named; that a wife was honored here is supported by the plural in line 4 and by LSAM72, which shows (lines 10 and 35) a single agathos daimon of husband and wife jointly. Recognizing a Carian proper name in line 9 Kooivaq 23 he restored in 6 [Koaivaq]. That name can be either masculine (I.Mylasa 223) or feminine (336). But the nominative on record for both genders is Kooivaq; we ought to assume that the name here in line 9 is likewise nominative. As such, it needs to be the subject of a verb. If this is so, what seems most likely is the citation of a precedent: cbq ?7ioi?ixo] Kai Kooivaq. Kosinas then would be Leon's predecessor as priest24 Thus, if Leros' wife was mentioned in line 6, we cannot guess her name. And a further caution is in order: the space in 6 might instead hold a banal adverbial phrase, e.g. Kai [eiq xo ?.out?v 0u]?iv. I propose then the following reconstruction: [.]o[-5iaK?ip?vou&lt;; npoq x? 0?iov?] ooiax; Ka[i evaefi&amp;q-dvayop?] U?iv Kaxd 7ca[aav ?opxTyv cbq xovq ?auxco] 4 v ?U?pY?xa&lt;;, a[\)xou&lt;; xe Kai EKyovouc;*] i?puoaoOai be ?co[pov Kai x?p?voq xou] Saipovoq A?pco Kai [-(?7u)0u] ?iv A?ovxa xov kpda e[n\ xou ?copou] 8 Kpi?v ?Kaoxou ?viauxou, [d&gt;&lt;; ?7roi?ixo] Kai Koaivaq* 20 A classical example is Xen.

Magnesia on the Maeander These last considerations can be applied to a sacred law from Magnesia on the Maeander.25 In the second century B.C. the city took charge of what apparently had been a private cult of Sarapis. The inscription, broken at the top, details the obligations that the priest Pharsalius will owe to the god and the obligations that the city will owe to the priest; a rider extends these rules to his successors, who will obtain the cult by purchase. The first surviving provision describes the city's responsibilities to supply sacrificial victims. Then come the priest's obligations (text Sokolowski 1974): 9 Kaxaoxr|oei Se k[ai iepea ev xanj [xjepivei xcoi dvaxeGevxi xcoi Gea&gt;v Ax|\|/exai 8[e xcov Guojievcov] [e]v xtm xepivei dcp' eKaoxou iepeiou CKiXoq Kai [xcov xiGepivoov] 12 [x]coi Gea&gt;i xd xpixa pipr)* ev a^Acoi 8e xorccui yd] [rcoieixo) ie] [p]6v XapdmSoq* (ktA,.) In the temenos he will establish: a neokoros (9 K[ai vecoKopov Dittenberger), which is too long; or with Sokolowski a priest - an "auxiliary priest", as he put it (1974,448). Most recently, Bricault has put a query after the word iepea: rightly so, for this duplicated title is improbable for two persons of different rank and function.26 But the idea was a reasonable deduction from the verb, which often serves for "appointing" a person to an office; most pertinent here is an Athenian text, KaGiaxdxco 5e r\ dei Xav^dvouaa iepe[ia ?aKo]pov 27 However, there is no further mention of this additional personage or his duties 28 More impor tant, one does not appoint a person "in" a sacred space; Dittenberger's justification, that the task of a neoko ros was to oversee sacred space, is uncogent, at least in connection with this verb. What one might set in a temenos is more likely a structure, as Kern had assumed ("einen Altar?"): we should restore in line 9 K[ai ?coia?v. The verb KaGicjxripa is admittedly unusual for this. LSCG 129.15 has x?v ?co|i?v Kai x? c;odviov Kaxaoxaoai nakiv eq x?v xoi%ov; cf. Malalas 8.13 Kaxaoxriaaq eVrcpocGev amr\q ?a&gt;|i?v u\|/r|A,6v. These are feeble support. But an altar is what we would expect of a cult in its begin nings, and the most that an individual is likely to have been required to build, at least before the wealthy of the Roman Empire. The restoration ?cojaov is almost certain if Kern's restoration of the priest's next duty (lines 12-13) is right, \n\ [rcoieiXG) ?col|Li?]6v lapaniboq (followed by Vidman and Bricault). Sokolowski (1974, 448) pre ferred ielpjov here because a temple is "more important" to build than an altar. Whatever the relevance of importance, a building would more likely be the ill-fitting vla]6v. This line as restored is short; rather than Tioieixco, perhaps i8p\)eo0co or a compound - the most common verb for establishing an altar;29 or KaGiaxdxco in keeping with the verb in line 9. Whatever the verb, an altar, as Kern thought, is again the likely object here, a prohibition parallel to the action that is required in lines 9-10. Given the specification of what animal part the priest is to receive, the "one third" that follows (or 8i5o|ievcov Stengl; Kaiojuevcov Dittenberger) will refer to cash donations, perhaps in connection with the 25 O.

Where had the cult been before? Certainly in private space - perhaps the house of Pharsalius, or in various and changing places. For Magnesia has not only taken over the cult but also, as line 10 dvaxe?evxi suggests, provided land. The city's prohibition against other altars may derive from concern about a prior tradition of a moveable or private rite. Thus the Magnesians inaugurated the public tendance of Sarapis with a new precinct and a new altar. The city has donated the first, Pharsalius is responsible for building the second. 4. Lampsacus In the second century B.C. Lampsacus regulated in great detail the public cult of Asclepius; the text is known from a copy made by H. Kiepert.32 Two national celebrations are stipulated for each year; all Lamp sacenes are to wear crowns. The initial act is assigned to the priest (19-21): 6 be iepevq Gupidxco ?ai[? 87ri] 20 xou ?copou xou AcjkAiituou Kai empe^eioGco cmcoc; 8dcpvr|{i} Kaivri [? ev] [xco] iepco eiq xouq oxecpdvouq* This is followed by a public proclamation, then by a procession; and then the epimenioi of the Asclepieia are to sacrifice on the altars in the precinct: 0uex]cooav erci xcov ?copcov xcov ev xco xepevei (29). The priest's gesture in line 19 seems inauguratory - so perhaps not a sacrifice, which the epimenioi perform later. In 19 commentators reasonably have sought a direct object for 6\)pidxco,33 something to set smoking on the altar 34 Robert's solution is the best Greek and the best-attested behavior: Gupidxco &lt;A,i&gt;?av[cox6v 35 Frisch cited good parallels for this, but declined to incorporate so substantial an emendation into his text. I propose an alternative which preserves the reported letters. The verb Gupidco can be used absolutely, "perform a fumigation" (a number of citations in LSJ) - that is, to burn incense (or other aromatics), or sulphur. So among the Athenians' honors for Ariarathes, o[xe](pa[vouv x? dya^pa x? xou ?aoi^ecoq] Kai Gupiav k[ai] 8a!5a ioxdveiv (IG II2 1330.37); upon the opening and closing of a temple at Teos, a[Tcev8eoGai] Kai GupidaGai Kai ^uxvarcxeioGai (LSAM 28.12); 30 Sokolowski 1974,440, considered that this was a one-third portion of sacrifices for his secondary priest, tacitly leaving the main priest two-thirds. 31 Sokolowski (1974) restored ev xcoi iepcoi in lines 7 and 27, which state where sacrificial food is to be consumed. The space available for the first is indeterminate, but in the second Kern had restored ev xco[t xeuivei, which suits the space better and is consistent with the terms of the surviving text. 32 P.

Aromatics can of course be burned on an altar. But as in some Christian sects, a priest might also walk in procession swinging a censer. Small thymiateria have been excavated in the hundreds. Many are on chains, meant to be carried; and we read of them being so used.36 A purification often preceded a major ritual event;37 and purification of a space with a censer inevitably involved walking - "Bring me fire", orders Odysseus as he stands in his house 38 Accordingly, I suggest ?upidxco ?ou[vcuv ?nb] xou ?copou: the priest "is to cense/fumigate, walking from the altar, and is to see that fresh laurel... in the sanctuary for the crowns". The starting-point of his action is specified, the altar that typically stood in front of a Greek temple. His path may have been from there into the temple building and up to the cult statue; or, as in some purifications, a circuit around the building and back to the altar,39 perhaps visiting the several altars mentioned in line 29. The actual sacri fices on the altars were subsequent (29). 5. Cius A fragmentary inscription at Cius in Bithynia records an oracle, probably of Apollo of Claros, giving rules for a cult that seems confined to women.40 The divinity is not identified in what survives; a goddess is assumed. The date is the end of the Hellenistic period or the early Empire. Most editors have printed a properly conservative text.

In lines 2-4, simplicity of dress is required of the women: "You are all to accompany the basket unshod and in clean clothes; but leave your gold at home, for this she heartily despises, but to those she is well-disposed" 41 The first line presents a textual problem.

Stavrianopoulou (ed.), Ritual and Communication (2006) 151-179. 41 This last is difficult: TtpooaD?dv means "address" and takes the accusative (see H. W. Nordheider, LfgrE 11538-1540). "Freundlich anreden" = "wohlgeneigt sein" tentatively Koerte, "welcomes simple garb" Cook (Zeus III 993), "erh?rt" Corsten. H. van Herwerden, Mnemosyne 28,1900,364, judged the word impossible and wondered if it might be a mistake for rcpoadiSi or Tcpoarjvfiq. I can imagine 7tpo%aipe!

This clearly is impractical. Furthermore, the line does not scan, and ouceToq is the culprit.

The dative case is implied by 8aixp&lt;?&gt;uex(u, and the feminine plural by what follows, where 7tdooci shows that women have already been introduced as the topic. This participle then ought to have an object; and what seems most needed in the fragment is a referent for the unexpressed subject of the verbs in line 4.1 suggest therefore for line 1: [-i]^aooopev[aioi Gedv] 5aixp&lt;e&gt;i)?xco dvip. What precedes might well be Sokolowski's xouq 8', "for the women who will propitiate the goddess, the carver is to be a man"; or (bq, for the women who come "in order to propitiate". The gravamen of the ruling, then, is not that the slaughterer must be male kin or a male priest, but that he must be male.42 In a cult reserved for women, that exceptional presence might well prompt an anxious question to be put to an oracle for clear adjudication. The act of killing was particularly fraught, and care could be applied in choosing who might do it (so LSCG 151.A.42-44); and that person's clothes would not be clean 43 Kent J. Rigsby, 5840 S.
