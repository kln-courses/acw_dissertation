<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 13, Number 4, October 1996 THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT: A NIETZSCHEAN ACCOUNT Fredrick Appel INTRODUCTION It is sometimes argued that one of the most important lessons we can learn from Nietzsche is the essentially dogmatic nature of all claims to objective truth.1 Nietzsche is said to demonstrate how all notions of truth and objectivity can be traced back to metaphysical, Platonic-Christian fantasies of an eternal, objective realm of Being or Reality to which truth seekers claim privileged access. According to this view, he is said to expose claims to objective truth for what they are: limited, partial interpretations that attempt to conceal their partiality under the language of objectivity. By contrast, Nietzsche (it is often argued) proposes an enticing type of non-dogmatic "perspectivist" thinking that remains aware of its particu larity and partiality. Inherent in this celebrated notion of perspectivism is said to be an admirable epistemic humility, a frank acknowledgement of the intrinsic limitations of the theorist's own position. And as one influen tial commentator has argued, this humility rescues Nietzsche's position from the inevitable charges of relativism: a stance of this sort is supposedly better than any of its rivals in virtue of its awareness of its own limitations (Nehamas 1985: 20-1, 33; cf. Blondel 1991: 146). This received view has been strongly criticized of late, and the piece that follows is meant to further and deepen the challenge. It will not be argued that the received view has been completely off the mark. On the contrary, it has succeeded in identifying an undeniably important element of Nietzsche's thought: his critique of a strong notion of objectivity rooted in the assumptions of metaphysical dualism and found, for example, in nine teenth-century positivism. As we shall see, Nietzsche's concern with dis tancing his own work from dualism leads him to approach terms like "truth" with extreme caution. Nietzsche considered these terms tainted by their long-standing association with Platonism and its descendents. However, his tendency to place terms like "truth" and "objectivity" between inverted commas should be seen in light of his own project of real truth telling. There is another notion of objectivity to which the author o? Beyond Good and Evil wholeheartedly subscribes, an account of objective truth that owes nothing to belief in a Platonic or Christian "real" world of Being. 483</page><page sequence="2">484 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Nietzsche thinks it possible to make a truth-claim in the strong sense ? a claim that something is true not just for oneself, but true ?berhaupt, as such ? while subscribing neither to Platonic metaphysics nor to positivist philosophy of science. Many commentators who subscribe to the received view have rightly noted Nietzsche's refusal to countenance the possibility of infallibility, even on his own behalf. In light of the impossibility of the universal standpoint of Being and the infinite number of possible perspectival viewpoints, Nietzsche concedes that his perspective, too, must be partial and limited. However, this claim is crucially balanced by his insistence that his own perspective (on the nature of the universe, human psychology, morality, etc.) is not as limited ? and nowhere near as distorted ? as those of its rivals. Far from demarcating his perspectivism from all conceptions of objectivity, as the received view assumes, Nietzsche aims at reconciling the notion of objective truth with the ubiquity of perspective. An outline of how Nietzsche identifies a particular anthropomorphic standpoint ? his own ? as the one most likely to grasp a complex, multifarious reality will be presented below. True, he describes his views on what he sees as the facts of life as "limited", but only because he dismisses as nonsensical any notion of a limitless, perspective-less under standing (a "God's eye view" of reality). The received view is quite right to draw our attention to this, but what it has obscured from view is Nietzsche's other crucially important claim: that his limited stance is truer or more objective than those of his rivals in virtue of his ability to rise above popular prejudice and ignorance and grasp the dynamics of certain natural phenomena ?e.g. the fundamentals of human psychology and the perva sive role of the "will to power" in all of life ? that remain hidden from cruder sensibilities. A critical inquiry into Nietzsche's substantive views on the "will to power" and on the existence of a natural order of rank (Rangordnung) between different types of human beings is beyond the scope of this essay. Indeed these views are vulnerable to attack, if only because Nietzsche often chooses simply to assert their allegedly self-evident nature rather than mount serious arguments for their veracity. This paper focusses rather on an exploration of Nietzsche's own claim to objectivity and its relationship to his (rather dubious) assumptions of Rangordnung. It will be argued that Nietzsche's conception of objective truth is inextricably linked with his belief that the human species is characterized by an ontological hierarchy of higher and lower types. Only the creative few who possess inherently noble, life-affirming "instincts" and who recognize themselves as truly superior, he claims, can realistically strive for and courageously and joy fully embrace truth. Nietzsche concludes that an ?lite so defined enjoys an almost proprietary right over objective truth in its inimitable ability to attain a point of view that is much less one-sided than those of lower order human beings.</page><page sequence="3">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 485 This dimension of Nietzsche's thought ? his belief that the pursuit and grasp of objective truth is the business of superior human beings who recognize themselves as such ? has not been well explored by recent commentators. While we may recoil from the anti-egalitarian assumptions behind Nietzsche's conception of objectivity, we ought not to let our liberal democratic sensibilities prevent us from examining this conception more closely. It is uncontestable that Nietzsche's dissatisfaction with positivist and Platonic accounts of truth is widely shared in contemporary philoso phy. In conclusion, once Nietzsche is rescued from the received view's subjectivist reading (a reading he would have found abhorrent) he may be of some help to us in developing a more adequate account of the objective standpoint. Truth versus "Truth" In a revealing passage from the autobiographical work Ecce Homo, Nietzsche lumps together the concepts "'God', 'soul', 'virtue', 'sin', 'the Beyond', 'truth', 'eternal life'" and denounces them as mere "imaginings, more strictly speaking lies from the bad instincts of the sick." (EH "Clever" 10; FN's emphasis) He claims that our adherence to this "servile" concep tual package has led us to interpret the world "in a false and mendacious [falsch und l?gnerisch] way, in accordance with the wishes of our rever ence..." (GS 346); thus we have actually banished truth "on principle" (EH Forward 3). Even worse, previous philosophers and moralists have all but succeeded in monopolizing the word "truth" for this mendacious package of beliefs and practices, making his own project of real truth-telling all the more difficult: "When mendaciousness [Verlogenheit] at any price appropriates the word 'truth' for its perspective, what is actually veracious [der eigen tlich Wahrhaftige] must be discovered bearing the worst names" (EH "Destiny" 5; D Pref. 3). In these passages the inverted commas around "truth" function not as an ironic distancing from all notions of truth, but rather, as Richard Schacht has perceptively observed, as a rhetorical device meant to flag "the putative 'truths' (which he takes actually to be Ties' and 'deceptions') of other-worldly religious thinkers and metaphysically in clined philosophers..." (Schacht 1983: 59). This unmasking of "truth" as lie clearly presupposes the existence of an authentic realm of truth outside the inverted commas. Nietzsche, however, is often reluctant to invoke the term itself because of the metaphysical baggage associated with it. He insists that authentic philosophers (like himself) "use big words sparingly; it is said that they dislike the very word 'truth': it sounds too grandiloquent" (GM III.8). His own taste, Nietzsche informs us elsewhere, "is for more modest expres sions..." (D Pref. 4). We should keep this preference in mind when inter preting his use of inverted commas in passages like Beyond Good and Evil,</page><page sequence="4">486 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY paragraph 43, where, after asking himself whether the "coming philoso phers" (of his sort) will be "new friends of 'truth'", he replies: "[i]n all probability: for all philosophers have hitherto loved their truths. But certainly they will not be dogmatists." Here the inverted commas are placed around "truth" to remind us to treat this term with great caution in light of its traditional association with transcendental metaphysics and theology. Nevertheless, as this and many other passages demonstrate, Nietzsche cannot avoid using it altogether. In stressing the non-dogmatism of the "coming philosophers", BGE 43 shows Nietzsche's keen interest in demar cating his genuine truth-telling from traditional philosophical efforts that have been bogged down in dogmatic accounts of the world. That Nietzsche is interested in real, as opposed to pseudo-truth-telling is demonstrated by his many unapologetic, serious claims to truth. When, for example, Zarathustra declares that one should combat "false values and false scrip tures" [falscher Werte und Wahn-Worte] (Z II OP) and when Nietzsche claims elsewhere that the "future task of the philosophers" is to solve "the problem of value" [das Problem vom Werte zu l?sen], to determine "the order of rank among values" [Rangordnung der Werte]u (GM 1.17), the goal seems to be a true, undogmatic account of the world. In a retrospective assess ment of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche declares that the work was "born out of the innermost abundance of truth [aus dem innersten Reichtum der Wahrheit]..." (EH Forward 4). "Zarathustra," he declares, "is more truthful [wahrhaftiger] than any other thinker. His teaching ... upholds truthfulness as the supreme virtue [die Wahrhaftigkeit also oberste Tugend]..." (EH "Destiny" 3). Until Zarathustra, he continues, "one does not know what height, what depth is; one knows even less what truth is." (EH "Z" 6)5 Just what is Nietzsche claiming when he purports to tell us the truth about reality? Consider a passage like the following: "Another mark of the theologian is his incapacity for philology. Philology is to be understood here in a very wide sense as the art of reading well ? of being able to read off a fact without falsifying it by interpretation [Tatsachen ablesen k?nnen, ohne sie durch Interpretation zu f?lschen]..." (AC 52; FN's emphasis). Here Nietzsche clearly evokes a reality independent of our interpretations and suggests that his "art of reading well" constitutes a privileged form of access to that reality. Is he succumbing here to positivist dogma, the largely discredited enterprise of attempting to gain an unmediated, theory-inde pendent access to reality? The Critique of Positivist "Objectivity" A positivist reading of AC 52 cannot be sustained. Nietzsche's critique of positivism, after all, has been widely recognized in the secondary litera ture, and something like it has been embraced in much of present-day</page><page sequence="5">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 487 philosophy of science and epistemology. Nietzsche famously claims that the positivist conception presupposes "an eye that is completely unthink able, an eye turned in no particular direction, in which the active and interpreting forces, through which alone seeing becomes seeing something, are supposed to be lacking..." (GM 111.12; FN's emphasis. Cf. WP481). The bogus "objectivity" that aims at "eliminat[ing] the will altogether" and at "suspending] each and every affect" strikes him as both ludicrous and contemptible (GM III. 12; FN's emphasis). Unlike the positivists, Nietzsche insists on what he sees as the inevitable intertwining of practical-normative commitments and the pursuit of knowledge. A fine summation of his position is found in the following fragment from the Nachlass: "the measure of the desire for knowledge depends upon the measure to which the will to power grows in a species: a species grasps a certain amount of reality in order to become master of it, in order to press it into service." (WP 480) Nietzsche claims that all forms of science ? indeed, any practical pursuit ? always involves a commitment to "an ideal of value, a value-creating power." [eines Wert-Ideals, einer werteschaffenden Macht] (GM 111.25). Even behind the apparently autono mous realm of logic, he insists, "there stand evaluations [Wer thsch ?tz un gen]..." (BGE 3; cf. BGE 6; WP 643). The so-called scientists and scholars who attempt to pursue their ideal of "absolute" or "pure" knowledge [Rein-Erkennenden] in a disinterested, value-neutral fashion turn their backs upon this reality. Refusing to offer value judgements of the objects of their study, they try "to be mere specta tors in everything" (Z II OIP) and act as though they were "objectifying and registering mechanisms with their innards removed." (GS Pref. 3) These efforts, however, are futile. Nietzsche claims that purveyors of positivist "objectivity" are themselves the unconscious partisans of a practical-nor mative stance, and a particularly loathsome one at that, as the appellation "learned cattle" [gelehrtes Hornvieh] (EH "Books" 1) indicates. He places them on the side of so-called "slave" (or "herd") morality because of their inability or unwillingness to differentiate between phenomena that are worthy of investigation and those contemptible, lowly aspects of the world that ought to be ignored. Their "prostration" before "petits faits" is derided as a form of "bad manners" (EH "BGE" 2; FN's emphasis). Nietzsche's vision of an ignoble modern "scientificality" [Wissen schaftlichkeit] (Ibid.) is vividly revealed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra in the persona of the "conscientious man", who observes and records "the facts" from the vantage-point of his home, the swamp. Regarding the objects of his investigations, the "conscientious" man asks rhetorically, '"what matter if it be great or small? If it be swamp or sky?.../ In truly conscientious knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small'" (Z IV L). Nietzsche believes that "conscientiousness" of this sort conceals an inability or un willingness to discriminate or rank that leads to an overall levelling of</page><page sequence="6">488 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY phenomena: the great is placed on the same plane as the insignificant. This levelling move, in Nietzsche's view, clearly favours the latter and dimin Q ishes the worth of the former. In light of this uncompromising critique of positivist notions of objectiv ity, on what basis can Nietzsche speak of the objectivity of his own claims to truth and knowledge? Are passages like the aforementioned citation from The AntiChrist (AC 52) simply inexcusable lapses on his part into positivist dogma? How is it possible, in other words, to make claims for the ubiquity of a practical-normative perspective without thereby defeat ing the claim to objective truth? OBJECTIVITY AND PERSPECTIVISM When Nietzsche declares that his position is better than those of his rivals he means neither than he has attained some universal viewpoint denuded of all perspective, nor (pace Nehamas) that he is the first philoso pher to have recognized the idiosyncratic, particular origin of his own views. Rather, Nietzsche believes that he has overcome the excessive one-sidedness of rival points of view, be they Christian, Kantian, socialist, anarchist, etc. "Before knowledge [ein Erkennen] is possible," he remarks, one must come to see the limitations of each and every "one-sided view [einseitige Ansicht] of the thing or event" in question (GS 333). Taking this first step towards knowledge requires a "mature freedom of spirit" that "permits access to many and contradictory modes of thought..." (HAH I Pref. 4), which in turn is the precondition for real objectivity: [T]he more affects we allow to speak about one thing, the more eyes, different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete [vollst?ndiger] will our "concept" [Begriff] of this thing, our "objectivity", [&lt;Objektivit?t&gt;] be. (GM III.12;FN's emphasis).9 Nietzsche deems this ability to "reverse perspectives" [Perspektiven um stellen] (EH "Wise" 1) a form of "impartiality" [Unbefangenheit], although, as noted above, he does not associate this term with value neutrality. His notion of impartiality or objectivity involves taking a "grand view for the course" [der gro?e Blick f?r den Gang] (EH "CW 2) that allows one to transcend the all-too-common prejudices of one's age. In The Gay Science this ability is described metaphorically in terms of overcoming gravity: In the main the question is how light or heavy we are ? the problem of our "specific gravity." One has to be very light to drive one's will to knowledge into such a distance and, as it were, beyond one's time, to create for oneself eyes to survey millennia... One must have liberated oneself from many things that oppress, inhibit, hold down, and make heavy precisely us Europeans today. (GS 380; FN's emphasis). In "overcoming gravity" in this sense, one is able to see that much of what had been considered timeless, eternal and self-evident is, in fact, histori cally contingent and problematic. In an early essay, Nietzsche refers to</page><page sequence="7">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 489 this as the attainment of a truly "suprahistorical vantage point" [?berhis torischen Standpunkt] from which "the essential condition of all happen ings" can be discerned (UM II. 1). Zarathustra demonstrates his attainment of this suprahistorical perspective by dismissing the purport edly eternal nature of "slave" morality as merely conventional, i.e. "only intervening shadows and damp afflictions and passing clouds" (Z III BS; cf. Z III OSG 2, GS 115). One of the great shortcomings of slave morality is its consistent inability or unwillingness to countenance and embrace this idea of impartiality: "Conscience, reputation, Hell, sometimes even the police have permitted and continue to permit no impartiality..." (D Pref. 3). This conception of objectivity incorporates the necessity of perspective, the fact that "[t]here is only a perspective seeking, only a perspective 'knowing'..." (GM 111.12; FN's emphasis). Through the attainment of ob jective knowledge, one learns that "all life is based on appearance, art, deception, point of view [Optik], the necessity of perspective [Not wendigkeit des Perspektivischen] and error" (BT "Attempt" 5; cf. HAH I Pref. 6, GS 374). It is in this, and only this sense that Nietzsche speaks glowingly of the "rich ambiguity" [vieldeutigen Charakters] of existence (GS 373; cf. WP 134, 481). Far from implying that existence is too rich to be decipherable or captured by any schema of meaning, as partisans of the received view often proffer, Nietzsche suggests that any one-sided view unable to recognize the need to take many vantage points into account will be unequal to the task of positing reality. Proponents of one-sided views, unable to scan the "big picture", remain caught within the insecure, exces sive solemnity and pomposity that Nietzsche associates with narrow minded dogmatism. By contrast, Nietzsche claims to have attained a better (and not simply a different or unique) understanding of reality by having experienced and transcended a plurality of narrow, limited perspectives. In describing the superiority of his philosophical position, Nietzsche pictures himself flying high above his dogmatic, one-sided rivals. From the serene, magnanimous viewpoint of this "meta"-level of analysis, which he claims to have attained after having "climbed above himself" and beheld "the ground of things and their background [aller Dinge Grund schaun und Hintergrund]" (Z III W), Nietzsche purports to see his own perspective at combat with, and victorious over, other perspectives. The achievement of this objective viewpoint is associated with a feeling of joyful equanimity: "[the great artist] arrives at the ultimate pinnacle of his greatness only when he comes to see himself and his art beneath him ? when he knows how to laugh at himself (GM III.3; FN's emphasis).12 Nietzsche balances the metaphor of height and bird-like transcendence with that of a descent into "the depths" of the human condition. As Zarathustra puts it, "[t]he highest must arise to its height from the deepest [Aus dem Tiefsten mu? das H?chste zu seiner H?he kommen]" (Z III W). The problem with most efforts at attaining a transcendent viewpoint</page><page sequence="8">490 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY heretofore, in his view, has been the lack of appreciation of this intimate relationship between ascent and descent. Resorting to a metaphor from nature, Zarathustra notes that the tree can rise to the heights only by plunging its roots "into the depths ? into evil" (Z IOTM. Nietzsche claims that his attainment of a transcendent, "suprahistorical" view has come about only through his exploration of the dark recesses of the human soul and his discovery therein of certain "hard" truths that only a select few could face unblinkingly. In sum, Nietzsche insists upon both the ubiquity of perspective and the possibility of objective truth through the cultivation of a nuanced, complex view of reality that transcends all one-sided perspectives in the course of a scientific exploration of the "depths" of the human psyche. While the pairing of perspective and objectivity may strike us as counterintuitive because of our routine association of the latter concept with the absence of bias or "disinterestedness", Nietzsche calls upon us to overcome this preju dice. An interpretation may be objectively true, claims Nietzsche, not because someone from a disinterested, God-like view could confirm that this is so, but rather because a highly cultivated and gifted person, capable of attaining the objectivity required for the grasping of truth, has recog nized it as such and deemed it to be so. This type of person ? a "strong" or healthy type, to use Nietzsche's terms ? "delineates reality as it is [dieser Art Mensch, die er konzipiert, konzipiert die Realit?t, wie sie ist]" (EH "Destiny" 5; FN's emphasis) and, unlike the "learned cattle" whom he disdains, is courageous enough to make the proper distinctions between that which is deserving of our consideration and those allegedly contempt ible aspects of reality that do not merit our close attention. To whom does this gifted character type refer? When he refers to a strong or master-type of human being, is Nietzsche simply talking about himself? It is tempting to think so, given the no small amount of self-aggrandize ment that characterizes his writing (particularly in a mature period work like Ecce Homo). However, for the most part Nietzsche imagines truth and knowledge to be the property (at least potentially) of a select number of human beings who share a sensibility and character similar to his own, a group of "kindred spirits" with whom he feels in spiritual solidarity and shares a certain "rank". Rangordnung and the Majority's Flight from the Truth Nietzsche regards every human being as first and foremost a "physiologi cal representative" or "carrier" [Tr?ger] of a particular order or rank of human existence and believes that our rank shapes our entire existence, determining the nature of our relations with others, how and why we seek to understand the world around us, and what we think most important in life (e.g. TI FGE 2). Of course, Nietzsche's conception of rank denotes hierarchy, as is clearly demonstrated by his repeated mention of an "unal</page><page sequence="9">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 491 terable innate order of rank [Rangordnung] between man and man" (BGE 263; cf. BGE 228). According to the laws of Rangordnung, each living species is divided generally into "different kinds of life" (WP 592) and more particularly into "ascending" and "descending" forms of the species in question. "Every individual," therefore, "may be regarded as representing the ascending or descending line of life" (TI EUM 33). Our place in this "order of castes," [Ordnung der Kasten] Nietzsche claims, "is only the sanctioning of a natural order [Natur-Ordnung], a natural law of the first rank over which no arbitrary caprice, no 'modern idea'has any power." (AC 57, FN's emphasis; cf. BGE 213) The natural order also ordains that the representatives of "a higher, brighter humanity" are "very small in number (for everything outstanding is by its nature rare)..." (WP 993, FN's empha sis; cf. WP 317, 420), while those who represent degeneration will be many: Among men, as among every other species, there is a surplus of failures [Mi?ratenen], of the sick [Kranken], the degenerate [Entartenden], the fragile [Gebrechlichen], of those who are bound to suffer [Leidenden]; the successful cases are, among men too, always the exception. (BGE 62). As argued elsewhere,15 it is Nietzsche's view that the minority of "higher men" have at all times represented the human species at its peak. Strong, life-affirming creative types are treated as exemplars, as it were, of hu mankind. Nietzsche believes that only those few within the ascending line of humanity have the innate capacity to aspire to the sort of objectivity described above as necessary for the attainment of a true grasp of reality. Since Nietzsche's conception of objectivity is tied to the ubiquity of perspec tive, truth and knowledge appear in his view to be tied to the position of the minority, ascending line of the human species. Only they can turn "from a morbid perspective [Kranken-Optik] towards healthier concepts and values [ges?nderen Begriffen und Werten]..." (EH "Wise" 1; FN's emphasis). To think the contrary, to suppose that truth can be made accessible to everyone (given the proper circumstances, a strong system of mass education, etc.), is, in Nietzsche's eyes, a grave mistake. Truth can never be the property of that unhealthy, declining fraction of humankind, the weak-minded "herd". Indeed, one ought to follow Nietzsche's lead in "get[ting] rid of the bad taste of wanting to be in agreement with many" (BGE 43) and come to realize that the "supreme insights" of the higher type of man "must ? and should! ? sound like follies, in certain cases like crimes ... to the ears of those who are not predisposed and predestined for them" (BGE 30; cf. BGE 87, 202, 287; GS 381; AC Pref.; EH Pref. 3, 4, "Books" l).16 Because "the service of truth" is for Nietzsche "the hardest service" (AC 50), it remains forever the purview of a minority. "To be truthful [Wahr sein]? few can do it!" (Z III ONL 7; FN's emphasis). The truth remains inaccessible to the majority because its uncompromising harshness pre</page><page sequence="10">492 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY vents its easy embrace: "the truth speaks out of me. ? But my truth is dreadful [furchtbar]..." (EH "Destiny" 1; FN's emphasis). Elsewhere he describes the truths that must be told as "plain, harsh, ugly, repellent, unchristian, immoral" (GM 1:1; cf. GM 1.16, 17; BGE 202, 228; EH "GM"), and declares that the value of a human life is measured by "how much truth can a spirit bear, how much truth can a spirit dare..." (EH Forward 3; FN's emphasis). What is so difficult about these harsh truths, and why, in Nietzsche's view, are so few capable of facing them directly? Nietzsche argues that the "herd" ? or the "good" men, as he sometimes calls them ? could embrace neither the death of God nor the non-existence of any higher plane of existence because their belief in these nonentities undergirds their lives and helps them make sense of their worldly suffer ing. "Good men never tell the truth," he claims, for the condition of their existence [Existenzbedingungen] "is the lie ?: expressed differently, the desire not to see at any price what is the fundamental constitution of reality..." (EH "Destiny" 4; FN's emphasis). He speaks, for example, of the "most inherent cowardice in the face of reality" of most of his fellow Germans, "which is also cowardice in face of truth [Feigheit vor der Wahrheit]..." (EH "CW 2; FN's emphasis). The lies of the many are looked down upon as the scarcely willful, pathetic responses of those without the strength of character to look an intrinsically fearful reality in the eye. In other words, the weak, cowardly majority lie out of necessity; because of their innate defects of character they must falsify reality. Nietzsche suggests that being forced to come to terms in a forthright, honest manner with the absence of a transcendental ground for meaning would lead a lesser, servile sort of man "to nausea and suicide" (GS 107). Confronting the nonexistence of transcendental sources of meaning and the absence of any other-worldly redemption after mortal life, believes Nietzsche, would utterly crush him. Life, for such a disillusioned, weary soul, would "be felt to be undesirable, valueless in itself"; it would be "crushed beneath the weight of contempt..." (BT "Attempt" 5). Such a man, who finds his life of deprivation and suffering difficult to bear and is bereft of the internal resources necessary for a more autonomous, optimistic stance, tends to push aside the truth and craves instead a mythical, external source of validation of his existence. Hence the origin, amongst the needy, un-self-sufficient majority, of tran scendental, religious worldviews and ascetic practices which "slam shut" the door to "all suicidal nihilism" by providing a supposedly externally grounded interpretation for human existence and suffering and the hope of redemption (GM III.28). "It was suffering and impotence [Unver m?gen]" claims Zarathustra, that created all afterworlds.../ Weariness, which wants to reach the ultimate with a single leap, even a death-leap [Todessprunge], a poor ignorant weariness [eine arme unwissende M?digkeit], which no longer wants even to want: that created all gods and afterworlds. (Z I OAW; cf. TI RIP 6; WP 586c).</page><page sequence="11">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 493 Even post-religious philosophical constructs, like Kant's Kingdom of Ends, are said to be rooted in this same, insecure need "to render the 'moral realm' unassailable..." (D Pref. 3; WP 519). This desire for external valu ation of morality lead to flights of metaphysical fancy and spurious, dual istic constructions pitting a supposedly higher, transcendent realm of Being against an "apparent," transitory world of human life that invariably comes out second best. "Reality has been deprived of its value, its meaning, its veracity," insists Nietzsche, "to the same degree as an ideal world has been fabricated..." (EH Forward 2, FN's emphasis; cf. WP 461; EH "Des tiny" 8). Given Nietzsche's propensity to trace intellectual positions back to ques tions of character and disposition (e.g. GS Pref. 2, GS 370; BGE 4, 6; TI PS 2), it should come as no surprise that his criticism of this supposed web of fabrication is inseparable from his disparaging, ad hominem assessments of those who allow themselves to be caught in it. Just as some philosophers need their philosophy as "a prop" or "a sedative" (GS Pref. 2), so servile people in general need to flee the truth about reality and take refuge in the comforting lie: Recognition, affirmation of reality [Die Erkenntnis, das Jasagen zur Realit?t] is for the strong man [den Starken] as great a necessity as is for the weak man [den Schwachen], under the inspiration of weakness, cowardice and flight in the face of reality ? the 'ideal'... They are not at liberty to know: d?cadents need the lie ? it is one of the conditions of their existence [Erhaltungs-Bedin gungen]. (EH "BT 2; FN's emphasis). This passage clearly suggests that the false and unhealthy beliefs held by the "weak" must be accounted for by something much deeper than an ill-advised, easily-remedied decision to embrace a set of false theories. Were the latter the case, the weak and unhealthy could presumably become stronger and healthier by being weaned from the false belief systems and encouraged to embrace views more in line with the true state of things. For Nietzsche, however, this is simply inconceivable. The vulgar majority's embrace of falsehood and illusion is seen as a symptom of a much more deeply-rooted state of affairs ? the mean state of their souls, the base quality of their desires ? and as such cannot be broken. Any efforts at changing their patterns of belief or desire are doomed to failure, as Nietzsche's Zarathustra learns in the Prologue to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, where his vision of the ?bermensch is ridiculed and his dark portrait of the "last man" enthusiastically embraced.17 Truth as an Elite Vocation The idea that Nietzsche associates truth-seeking with the pragmatic aims of individuals or groups has been resisted by a number of commenta tors (e.g. Kaufmann 1974: 360; Schacht 1983: 7, 74-5; Warren 1988: 93) who point to Nietzsche's claim that the "harsh" truths of which he speaks clash with the pragmatic needs and aims of so-called lower human beings.</page><page sequence="12">494 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Nietzsche refers to the metaphysical beliefs of the herd, for example, as "life-preserving errors" (lebenerhaltenden Irrt?mer) (GS 110) that have nothing to do with truth (WP 487; cf. WP 172, 255, 483). We have already noted his view that the majority tend to avoid truths that would be "harmful and dangerous" to them "to the highest degree" (BGE 39). This does not mean, however, that Nietzsche scorns any and every pragmatic approach to truth. To argue that Nietzsche always holds truth to be separable in principle from the affirmation of a particular life-form is to fall into the error of assuming that he believes truth to be something neutral, divorced from all forms of human life and tables of values. On the contrary, Nietzsche posits an intimate link between objective truth and the self-affirmation of a particular form of human life ? the "higher" type. In Nietzsche's view, truth is only accessible to and is revealed only through the joyous self-ag grandizement of this higher type. To put it another way: the self-centered creative outbursts of the Nietzschean free spirit is conceived as part and parcel of a joyous embrace of the "terrible" truths of human existence (EH "BT 2; cf. Leiter 1994: 346-7). Among the "privileges of the very few", claims Nietzsche, "is that of representing happiness, beauty, benevolence on earth. Only the most spiritual human beings are permitted beauty, beautiful things" (AC 57). Only the very best human beings, in other words, can define what is good and bad, or beautiful and ugly, as such. Thus the healthy, pragmatic aims of a truly life-affirming caste of higher men are wholly in line with truth. Nietzsche believes that ownership of truth is so securely in the hands of the highest sort of human being as to warrant his playing with it, twisting it as he sees fit with "mendacious innocence" in the manner of Socrates' "noble lie" [edlen L?gen] (Z IV S). The highest sort is someone for whom "the lie is sanctified and the will to deception has a good conscience" (GM III.25; FN's emphasis) precisely because he is in such confident possession of it. In the hands of the highest sort, lying may even be compatible with justice: "[t]o him who wants to be just from the very heart," claims Zarathustra, "even a lie becomes philanthropy [Menschen-Freundlichkeit]" (Z I OAB). By contrast, those not in possession of the truth ? the vast majority ? can only be slaves to what they believe to be true; i.e. they feel obliged to "speak the truth" (i.e. what they consider to be true) regardless of the worth of their utterance or the consequences. As Zarathustra sug gests, "inability to lie is far from being love of truth [Ohnmacht zur L?ge ist lange noch nicht Liebe zur Wahrheit]... He who cannot lie does not know what truth is" (Z IV OHM 9).18 Nietzsche's truth-seeker is someone with the courage and intellectual honesty to acknowledge that his desire for truth is driven by a noble self-aggrandizement. When Zarathustra says that his "will to power" walks with the feet of the enlightened man's will to truth (Z II OSO),</page><page sequence="13">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 495 Nietzsche means to suggest that the highest man's cognitive activity is, first and foremost, a tool used to exert his mastery over the world: "In knowing and understanding [Erkennen], too," insists Zarathustra, "I feel only my will's delight in begetting and becoming [meines Willens Zeuge und Wer de-Lust]., r (Z II OBI). Unlike the bloodless pseudo-scientist dis cussed earlier, who subscribes to wrongheaded positivist ideals of value neutrality, Nietzsche's new philosopher joyfully acknowledges that his sensations [Sinn] and cognition [Geist] are but the "instruments and toys" [Werk- und Spielzeuge] of his will to power (Z I ODB). Moreover, the truth-seeking related to this healthy, expansive will to power is said to be directed to something else, something grander than but inseparable from the free spirit's self-assertion. In this context Nietzsche speaks repeatedly of an important sense of responsibility that "penetrate[s] to the profoundest depths and become[s] instinct" in superior men (GM II.2; cf. BGE 203, 212; WP 944; EH "Z" 6). Nietzsche ? and, in his view, any self-respecting higher man ? feels deeply responsible for "the preservation and enhancement of the power of a certain species of animal," the human species (WP 567). He believes that the ultimate value of all truth-seeking worthy of the name is to contribute the search for "a new greatness of man [eine neue Gr??e des Menschen], a new untrodden path to his enlargement [Vergr??erung]." (BGE 212; FN's emphasis).19 In the prologue to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, this all-important project of humankind's moral-spiritual improvement is represented by the ?ber mensch. As Zarathustra insists, truth and knowledge ought to be directed towards his cultivation and flourishing: "I love him who lives for knowledge and who wants knowledge that one day the Superman may live" (Z Pro logue 4). And since Nietzsche believes that only a few, higher human beings can strive for ?bermenschlich-status, he calls upon these few to abandon their misguided concerns for the fate of the vast majority and work towards the improvement of the species through a "selfish" preoccupation with themselves and their own moral and spiritual development (see, for exam ple, Z IV OHM 11). In contrast to the narrow-minded, petty selfishness of 90 the lower orders, Zarathustra speaks of "the sound, healthy selfishness [die heile, gesund Selbstsucht] that issues from a mighty soul..." (Z III TET 2), where concern with the self and with human excellence merge: "there will be worship [Anbetung] even in your vanity [Eitelkeit]]" (Z II OSM) "For the sake of his children," claims Zarathustra of himself, "must Zarathustra perfect himself [sich selbst vollenden]" (Z III OIB). CONCLUSION In this essay Nietzsche's complex and often ambiguous relationship to the notions of truth and objectivity have been clarified. Nietzsche's often ironic and derisive treatment of these terms have led more than a few commentators to the conclusion that he wishes to distance himself from</page><page sequence="14">496 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY any idea of objective truth. It has been argued, on the contrary, that Nietzsche's irony and derision are selective, directed only at a certain conception of these terms stemming from a metaphysics that he steadfastly rejects. He aims at debunking fraudulent claims to objectivity ? notably of Platonic and positivist varieties ? in the name of a more accurate, honest account of reality. Nietzsche's claim to have grasped objective truth is in no way dependent upon an attempt to leave behind the particular. While the traditional imagery of transcendence remains part of Nietzschean objectivity (in, for example, his claim to have attained a "supra-historical" vantage point from which the apparently eternal is unmasked as historically contingent and transitory), it is balanced by his insistence that ascent depends crucially upon the ability to descend into the "depths" of one's particularity. In Nietzsche's view, however, not just anyone's personal self-examination will lead to a true account of the world. Only the investigations of a particular type of human life ? an "ascending", "healthy" or "higher" type represented by only a very few ? have the potential of bearing fruit, for only the superior few are equipped (in a dispositional, instinctual sense) to face and joyfully embrace the "terrible" truths of existence. Nietzsche's substantive views of what constitutes the objective truth of human existence ? for example, that life is will to power, that a natural inequality amongst human beings exists and is sanctioned by an allegedly ontological rank order, and that hierarchy, domination and exploitation are preconditions for human excellence (e.g. BGE 259) ? are open for and indeed highly vulnerable to criticism. In the end, what may be most valuable about Nietzsche's stance is less his substantive views than his attempt to develop a non-positivist, non-Platonic notion of objectivity. His dissatisfaction with existing models of objectivity seems to foreshadow more recent discontent expressed by contemporary philosophers. A recent article reviewing the state of contemporary moral philosophy notes, for example, that this dissatisfaction is widely shared across a variety of schools of thought. The authors suggest that a (modest) convergence of sorts is emerging around the Nietzschean idea of a conception of objectivity that incorporates some strong component of particularity: "[m]oral real ists, constructivists, and quasi-realists alike look to the responses and reasons of persons, rather than some self-subsistent realm to ground moral practice." (Darwall et.al., 1992: 187. Cf. John McDowell 1994) Nietzsche's agenda, in this limited sense, remains our own.

A list of the abbreviations is provided at the end of this article. 4. Berkowitz notes that Nietzsche's ideal philosopher "refrains from presenting himself as a martyr to truth, and even avoids using the word truth. This avoidance</page><page sequence="17">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 499 does not stem from an aversion to truth but, quite the contrary, reflects a kind of love that recoils from the degradation through common usage that the word truth has suffered..." (1995: 91, Berkowitz's emphasis) 5. For a sampling of other earnest appeals to truth, see: D 91, 164, 456, 556; GS 2, 319, 335; BGE 227, 229; AC 36. See also BGE 230, where Nietzsche insists that the task of the "seeker after knowledge" must be the recognition of "the eternal basic text [ewigen Grundtext] o? homo natura." In this passage Nietzsche asserts that prior claims to "knowledge" have been superficial precisely because they have ignored this "eternal basic text" of man. As Leiter correctly notes, "[t]hat this text is eternal and basic implies ... that readings which do not treat man naturalistically misread the text ? they 'falsify' it. And it is precisely such misreadings of 'texts' that Nietzsche the 'good philologist' aims to correct." (Leiter 1992: 279) 6. It should be noted that Nietzsche's critique is not absolute. Like the positivists, he remains committed to the general empiricist criterion that sense experience is the source of all genuine knowledge. See, for example, BGE 134: "All credibility, all good conscience, all evidence of truth comes only from the senses [Sinnen]" Cf. TI RIP 3,6 and the discussion in Leiter 1994: 336-37. 7. Martha Nussbaum rightly points out that Nietzsche believes "all our cognitive activity, including logical reasoning, including the abstracting and generalizing tendencies, are ... ways in which we try to master the world and to make ourselves secure in it." (Nussbaum 1991: 95) 8. Nietzsche sees the same sort of levelling in nineteenth-century literary Natu ralism. See GS Pref. 4; GS 347; TI EUM 7; WP 821. 9. Berkowitz's commentary on this passage is most useful: "[Nietzsche] advises his fellow philosophers to view 'one thing' from as many angles as possible. But the collection of multiple perspectives of 'one thing' presupposes that the 'one thing' under examination stays the same and that its look or nature can be pieced together by synthesizing views attained from many angles... [T]his key passage advances a method for overcoming or neutralizing the inevitable distortion that results from viewing a multifaceted object from a single vantage point." (1995: 288) 10. See, for example, Allison 1985: xvii; and Blondel 1991: 5-6, 145. 11. Nietzsche suggests that his new, superior brand of philosopher attains this ascendant position only after a long period of self-transformation. The new philoso pher must have lived in, and shed, many different "skins." He "must perhaps have been critic and sceptic and dogmatist and historian and, in addition, poet and collector and traveller and reader of riddles and moralist and seer and 'free spirit' and practically everything, so as to traverse the whole range of human values and value-feelings and be able to gaze from the heights into every distance, from the depths into every height, from the nook-and-corner into every broad expanse with manifold eyes and a manifold conscience." (BGE 211; FN's emphasis) 12. Nietzsche routinely uses the term "artist" in an unconventionally expansive way to refer to endeavors that have little to do with the realm of "art", narrowly conceived. Thus, for Nietzsche, the scientist at his best is a sort of creative artist (GS 335), as is a great politician like Pericles (PTA 19; GM 11.18). This point is discussed at length in Ruth Abbey and Fredrick Appel, "Nietzsche and the Will to Politics", unpublished manuscript, 1996. 13. While a full examination of Nietzsche's stance towards science is beyond the scope of this essay, I would simply suggest that the common view of the author of Beyond Good and Evil as an unrepentant sceptic about science is mistaken. (For a recent articulation of the commonly-held opposing view, see Leslie Paul Thiele 1990: 103-118). Nietzsche's advocacy of (non-positivist) scientific method extends beyond the so-called "positivist" works of the late 1870s into the mature writings of the 1880s. For a sampling of Nietzsche's privileging of objective scientific method</page><page sequence="18">500 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY as the way to truth, see: GS 335; BGE 23, 207; GM 1.17, 11.12, 111.16, 111.23; AC 12-13, 47, 49, 59; WP 442-3, 466, 469. 14.1 disagree with Strong's suggestion that for Nietzsche, there are "no necessary and permanent characteristics of a so-called human condition." (1988: 26; cf. 37) Nietzsche identifies Rangordung as an intrinsic, ubiquitous part of the human experience, one that we share with all of life. 15. "Nietzsche's Natural Hierarchy," in International Studies in Philosophy, Vol. XXIX, no. 3 (Fall 1997, forthcoming). In this article I argue that wherever Nietzsche speaks highly of the creative capacities and grandeur of the human species (in, e.g., Z II OV; Z III OVR 1; GM III. 13), he is always referring in fact to the capacities and grandeur of a small minority. 16. Cf. Berkowitz: "Nietzsche's understanding of dogmatism is rooted in the deeply aristocratic view that only the Tiigher type of man' is fit to hear, and live in accordance with, the higher insights... [H]uman beings are radically unequal in their capacity for, and right to, truth... Nietzsche [claims] that there is no reason for the superior individual to insist that everyone recognize the shape and require ments of the highest truths." (1995: 242) 17. Nietzsche is less pessimistic, however, about the prospect of communicating truths to other, "higher" men who (potentially) have the "ears" to hear them but whom he feels have been led tragically astray by mendacious doctrines of egalitari anism. As I argue in Nietzsche's Ethical Vision: An Examination of the Moral and Political Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche (Ph.D. dissertation, McGill University, 1995), Nietzsche hopes through his works to entice higher, free spirited individuals "out of their closets" and to embolden them in their strong individuality. Because "the best men have remained hidden ? and have often misunderstood themselves" (WP 870), his writings aim to give them the confidence to see who they are and act against modern doctrines of universal equality and uniformity and in accordance with their spiritual superiority. See also my "Bodily Wisdom: Nietzsche's Complex Relationship to Rationality" (unpublished manuscript, presented at the Annual Meeting of the Northeastern Political Science Association, Newark New Jersey, November 11th 1995). 18. See also GM III. 19: "Our educated people of today, our 'good people,' do not tell lies ? that is true; but that is not to their credit! A real lie, a genuine, resolute, 'honest' lie (on whose value one should consult Plato) would be something far too severe and potent for them..." (FN's emphasis) Kaufmann's insistence that "Nietzsche had the greatest scorn for [the noble lie]...." (1974: 326), while revelatory of Kaufmann's efforts at putting a respectable Enlightenment face on Nietzsche, is not borne out by the textual evidence. More helpful is Berkowitz: "Unlike Kant who rejected all lying in principle, Nietzsche advocates a virtuous use of true and lies. It is not an aversion to lying per se that compels Nietzsche to declare war on Kantian moral philosophy, but rather the fact that Kantian morality lies about the worth of lies, poisoning the truly virtuous by undermining their belief in their right to lie." (1995: 106; cf. 118) 19. Nietzsche's concern with the value of truth (and not, as is often suggested, its very existence) is most memorably taken up in the famous third essay of On the Genealogy of Morals. 20. See, for example, Zarathustra's attack on "sick selfishness" [die kranke Selbstsucht] in Z I OBV 1, and the reference to the "self-seeking [eigenn?tzig] cattle and mob" in WP 752.</page><page sequence="19">THE OBJECTIVE VIEWPOINT 501 ABBREVIATIONS AC BGE BT D EH GM GS HAH KGA PTA TI The Antichrist Beyond Good and Evil Birth of Tragedy "Attempt" Daybreak Ecce Homo "BGE" "BT "Books" "CW" "Clever" "Destiny" "GM" "Wise" "Z" On the Genealogy of Morals The Gay Science Human, Ail-Too Human AOM WS Werke: Kritische Gesamtausgabe Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks Twilight of the Idols "Attempt at a Self-Criticism" "Beyond Good and Evil" "The Birth of Tragedy" "Why I Write such Good Books" "The Case of Wagner" "Why I am so Clever" "Why I am a Destiny" "On the Genealogy of Morals" "Why I am so Wise" "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" "Assorted Opinions and Maxims" "The Wanderer and his Shadow" UM WP "FGE" "EUM" "PS" "RIP" Untimely Meditations The Will to Power "The Four Great Errors" "Expeditions of an Untimely Man" "The Problem of Socrates" "'Reason' in Philosophy"</page><page sequence="20">502 Z HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Thus Spoke Zarathustra "BS" "L" "LS" "OAB" "OAW" "OBI" "OBV" "ODB" "OHM" "OIB" "OIP" "ONL" "OP" "OSG" "OSM" "OSO" "OTM" "OV "OVR" "S" "TET' T "Before Sunrise" "The Leech" "The Last Supper" "Of the Adder's Bite" "Of the Afterworldsmen" "On Blissful Islands" "Of the Bestowing Virtue" "Of the Despisers of the Body" "Of the Higher Man" "Of Involuntary Bliss" "Of Immaculate Perception" "Of Old and New Law-Tables" "Of the Priests" "Of the Spirit of Gravity" "Of the Sublime Man" "Of Self-Overcoming" "Of the Tree on the Mountainside" "On Virtue" "Of the Vision and the Riddle" "The Sorcerer" "Of the Three Evil Things" "The Wanderer"</page></plain_text>
