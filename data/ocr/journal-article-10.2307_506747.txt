She has taught in several respected departments of Art History and Classics, worked as an innovative museum curator, and served as a generous and perceptive board member for numerous schol- arly organizations and museums. A pioneer in several areas of underwater archaeology, she has continued at the same time to publish in the fields of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. She has won prestigious awards for her books in fields as diverse as Roman sculpture and Roman harbors, and for a children's book on deep- water archaeology. Dr. McCann took her B.A. in Art History and Classics (Phi Beta Kappa) at Wellesley College in 1954 and spent the following year at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens on a Fulbright Scholarship. An M.A. in Art History at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York followed in 1957. Her Master's thesis, "Greek Statuary Types in Roman Historical Reliefs," reflects her early interest in Roman Imperial sculpture, which she followed up in her research for the Ph.D. in Art History and Classics at Indiana University in 1965. At Indiana and during her tenure of a Rome Prize Fellowship at the American Academy from 1964 to 1966, she worked on her study The Por- traits of Septimius Severus, A.D. 193-211, which appeared as a volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome (MAAR 30, 1968). During her years at the American Academy, Dr. McCann was struck by the potential importance of the still un- touched harbor site at Cosa. In 1965 she began the excavation of both the marshy lagoon and the submerged outer anchorage. An early believer in the value of a team approach to complex sites, Dr. McCann synthesized her collaborators' efforts in a remarkable contribution to the history of ancient technology and the economy of Re- publican Rome- The Roman Port and Fishery of Cosa: A Center of Ancient Trade (Princeton 1987) -awarded the AIA's James R. Wiseman Award for an outstanding archaeological publication in 1989 (AJA 94 [1990] 296), and the Outstanding Book Award of the American Association of University Presses for 1987. In the 1989 Jason Project, Dr. McCann moved from shallow to deep-water survey and excavation with Robert Ballard, at the site of a Byzantine shipwreck near Skerki Bank. Together, using the very latest technology, they demonstrated that controlled archaeological survey and sampling could take place at a depth of 800 m, far be- yond the limits of scuba. In this venture, as in a larger, follow-up project with Ballard in the same area in 1997, Dr. McCann had to endure initially much ungenerous and ill-founded criticism. Typically, she chose the route of scholarly publication (editing Deep Water Archaeology [JRA Suppl. 13, Ann Arbor 1994]) and intelligent, polite dis- course to win over her critics. Other archaeologists are now beginning to follow in her pioneering footsteps. It is typical of Dr. McCann's interest in the broad dissemination of archaeological information that she has also pre- sented the results of this research in numerous public lectures and television programs, in the popular press, and in a coauthored award-winning book aimed at children: The Lost Wreck of the Isis (Toronto 1990). Although her work in underwater archaeology would constitute an outstanding accomplishment in itself, Dr. McCann has carried on a parallel career in ancient art history. Her book Roman Sarcophagi in the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art (New York 1978) won several awards, including the Outstanding Book Award from the American As- sociation of University Presses. Dr. McCann has also published many seminal articles dealing with Greek and Roman sculpture. In large part as a result of her devotion to her family, Dr. McCann chose not to pursue long-term academic po- sitions, but she has nevertheless taught with great success at a number of distinguished institutions across the United States. She has worked generously with both undergraduate and graduate students, inspiring them with her enthusiastic teaching, providing excavation opportunities, and establishing scholarships for their support. Dr. McCann has given herself generously as well to the important task of lecturing to the public, in part through the AIA Lecture program and AIA Norton Lectureship for 1994-1995. She has been a pillar of support for the AIA for decades, with long service on the Executive Committee and Board of Trustees, and as a member or Chair of numerous committees. Throughout all this, Dr. McCann has concentrated with selfless generosity on another goal, inspiring young people and laypeople in general with her own enthusiasm for the study of ancient art and culture. Her firm belief</page><page sequence="3">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 257 in the dignity and importance of every individual has endeared her to literally thousands of people in the course of her professional career-from day laborers at Cosa to ambassadors in New York-and she has helped many students, colleagues, and fellow administrators simply to see more clearly and to think more humanely. Dr. McCann's most abiding and endearing qualities in the eyes of her many friends, however, are her absolute integ- rity, her loyalty to her colleagues and students, and her heartfelt devotion to archaeology. She exudes a warmth and humanity that inspires all who come in contact with her to reach beyond themselves. She is without doubt one of the great American archaeologists. "Where you lay up your treasure, there your heart will be also." ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA POMERANCE AWARD FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY NIKOLAAS J. VAN DER MERWE As archaeological science enters its fifth decade, it is unfortunately still true that many studies in this area nei- ther pose nor answer any question of real archaeological significance. Some individuals, however, have shown a talent for developing new methods to address important archaeological issues. Few have done this better than the South African archaeologist NikolaasJ. van der Merwe. The son of a school teacher in the remote eastern Cape Province, van der Merwe's career in archaeological sci- ence began by chance when in 1958 he won a scholarship, provided by a South African shipping line, to attend Yale University. In 1962 he majored there in physics and minored in anthropology. Yale was then active in the new field of archaeological science, and van der Merwe worked in the radiocarbon laboratory of Minze Stuiver and with the irrepressible geochemist Karl Turekian. A casual remark by the latter, to the effect that it ought to be pos- sible to date charcoal-smelted steel by the radiocarbon method, was pursued by van der Merwe as his Ph.D. re- search. This was almost certainly the first dissertation in anthropology to have been funded by NASA, and it was published as The Carbon-14 Dating of Iron (Chicago 1969). Archaeological application of this technique was lim- ited, however, by the large size of the sample required for decay counting. The advent of AMS radiocarbon dating in the 1980s has revived interest in this technique, making it possible to date important innovations in ferrous metallurgy without doing significant damage to valuable museum specimens. This is currently an area of active research by other scholars. Van der Merwe has made other significant contributions to the development of radio- carbon dating, most notably as consultant archaeologist to the Oxford Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Unit in the mid-1980s. From 1966 to 1974 van der Merwe taught anthropology at the State University of New York at Binghamton and applied his interests in radiocarbon dating and metallurgy within a large field project in his native South Africa. With support from the National Science Foundation, he directed a major program of field survey and excavation focused on preindustrial mining in the copper ore body at Phalaborwa, then in the earliest stages of destruction by open-pit mining. A major interest during this period was the scientific study of indigenous African mining and metallurgy; subsequently he expanded this interest to include ethnographic work on the last remnants of indige- nous iron smelting technology in West and East Africa. His work on this topic, together with that of fellow pio- neers Peter Schmidt and Don Avery, was highly influential and has been emulated by their students and col- leagues. The result is an exceptionally rich archive of ethnographic and technical data that supplies invaluable analogues for archaeologists to draw upon in interpreting prehistoric metalworking sites worldwide. In 1974 he moved to head the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cape Town, and his major re- search interest shifted to the work for which he is now best known. Since the mid-1960s the radiocarbon commu- nity in North America had known that 14C dates on corn kernels were systematically younger than those obtained on wood charcoal from the same levels, but could be corrected if the ratios of the stable carbon isotopes 13C and l"C were also measured. By 1970 plant physiologists had shown that the aberrant carbon isotope content of corn and many other tropical grasses resulted from a different mechanism of photosynthesis than that of plants in temperate climate zones. Van der Merwe's brilliant insight came in realizing that in certain circumstances the</page><page sequence="4">258 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 stable isotope analysis technique offered a means of tracking the spread of cereal agriculture. Since we are what we eat, the adoption of corn as a staple cereal in a temperate environment should result in a marked change in the stable carbon isotope ratios of bone protein (collagen) and bone mineral (apatite) in consumers. Van der Merwe demonstrated in 1977, after working with J.C. Vogel at the radiocarbon laboratory in Pretoria, that the adoption of corn agriculture in northeastern North America occurred in the later first millennium A.D.-half a millennium later than archaeologists then believed. He subsequently documented the rise of corn agriculture in the Amazon, highland Peru, and Belize, and extended the method to study marine and terrestrial components in the diet of prehistoric coastal peoples in South Africa and Ecuador. Stable isotope analysis has since become a standard method in the study of past diets, and the Cape Town laboratory remains at the cutting edge of research in this area. Van der Merwe and his former students Judy Sealy and Julia Lee-Thorp are also in- ternationally recognized for their research in the field of isotopic ecology and palaeoecology, where they employ stable isotope ratios to infer the diets of organisms from elephants to australopithecines. In 1988 van der Merwe was appointed the first Landon T. Clay Professor of Scientific Archaeology at Harvard University, but he continues to hold an adjunct appointment at Cape Town and to head the isotope laboratory there. At Harvard he has expanded his research into studies of the provenance of Greek and Roman marbles (a field pioneered by a previous recipient of the Pomerance Medal, Norman Herz). This account by no means exhausts van der Merwe's contributions to scientific archaeology, but constraints on space preclude discussion of other work. (We cannot however resist mentioning his chromatographic identifica- tion of residues in ancient smoking pipes, in the course of which he was licensed by the South African police to possess cannabis!). Few scholars in the field of archaeological science have been as innovative as Nik van der Merwe, and for this the Archaeological Institute of America honors him with the Pomerance Science Medal for 1998.</page><page sequence="5">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 259 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA EXCELLENCE IN UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING AWARD SUSAN E. ALCOCK The 1998 recipient of the Archaeological Institute of America's Undergraduate Teaching Award is Susan E. Alcock of the University of Michigan. Sue Alcock has been a remarkably innovative and successful teacher for the Department of Classical Studies. Rather than focus on traditional genre or period divisions, her undergraduate courses deal with important thematic topics such as "Food in the Ancient World: Subsistence and Symbol" (which also had an accompanying web site and a student-organized museum exhibition), "Death in the Ancient World," and a seminar for first-year students called "Death on Display in the Ancient World." In addition, she sub- stantially revised and reinvigorated two standing courses: "Introduction to Field Archaeology" and "Roman Ar- chaeology." Enrollments for the "Introduction to Field Archaeology" increased by a factor of five after a single teaching-it now enrolls over 200 students. Susan Alcock's courses integrate a variety of ways and methodologies on how to look at the past. Students praise her ability to make them see issues in a new light. As one said, "Sue's thinking is remarkably synthetic and wide- ranging; she sees connections and mutual intellectual interests across disciplines, which in turn shed new light on given issues. This has inspired me to take classes and seek out discussion partners in comparative literature, anthropology, and in other areas of art history." She is often cited by students for teaching them to think criti- cally, to go beyond their immediate preconceptions, and to question the current state of scholarly knowledge. Professor Alcock's excellence in teaching has been recognized already by the University of Michigan. She has received the Class of '23 Award in 1995 for excellence in undergraduate teaching, one of the most competitive prizes in the University; the Michigan Association of Governing Boards award for a Distinguished Faculty Mem- ber in 1996; and, most recently in 1998, the University's highest honor for ajunior faculty member, the Henry Russel Prize. Her citation for the Class of '23 Award neatly sums up her strengths as a teacher: "For her dynamic and enthusiastic teaching, her use of innovative and multimedia materials, her talent for making difficult mate- rial accessible and bringing the past to life, her transmission of professional and ethical standards, her time spent on field trips to show students the uses of the past, and, above all, her genuine concern for her students and their intellectual growth." But beyond the university citation's prose, perhaps her students say it best in the end: "Alcock is amazing. I want to be her when I grow up." That is the best praise of all-a healthy sign that the future may hold yet another archaeologist for the profession, the ultimate legacy of a good teacher.</page><page sequence="6">260 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA CONSERVATION AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AWARD DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION INSTITUTE OF ARCHAEOLOGY UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON The Department of Conservation at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, is the 1998 recip- ient of the Archaeological Institute of America's Conservation and Heritage Management Award. This is a newly instituted award to recognize exceptional achievement in the areas of archaeological conservation, conservation science, heritage management, or education and public awareness of archaeological conservation through teaching, lecturing, exhibitions, and publications. When the Institute of Archaeology was formally opened in 1937, the rudiments of a conservation program were already in place. Ione Gedye was hired on a part-time basis to mend pots and talk to students about what she was doing and why. Slowly her informal lectures developed into courses, and archaeology students came to learn the theory behind treatment as well as to receive practical experience in the treatment of artifacts. Gradually con- servation laboratories were properly equipped. After World War II, the program began to attract students specif- ically studying conservation and the Department of Conservation came into its own. Initially, the course was a one-year certificate program. Later it became a two-year course, then a three-year course. Finally, in the 1970s, the three-year course was turned into a degree course. Over the past 60 years, the Institute's conservation program has been unique in devoting itself exclusively to the training of archaeological conservators. Coming from many different countries, its graduates have been in- strumental in establishing and practicing conservation on excavations around the world, and caring for some of the world's most important cultural heritage. In addition, many graduates hold positions in museums interna- tionally and have been directly responsible for establishing conservation in these institutions. Some have as- sumed responsibilities in museum administrations where they have successfully advocated the importance of con- servation and collections care in the museum's daily activities. Others have gone on to establish training programs that have carried on the Institute's tradition of training archaeological conservators. In addition to training conservators, the Department of Conservation has continued its early practice of pro- viding archaeology students (and for the last 10 years museum-studies students) with a basic course in the princi- ples and theory of archaeological conservation. Over the years, this has served to provide a common ground for conservators, archaeologists, and museum curators, facilitating communication and understanding that has re- sulted in the better long-term care of our cultural heritage. It can be argued that in its 60 years of training archaeological conservators, the Department of Conservation of the Institute of Archaeology has been largely responsible for defining the discipline of archaeological conserva- tion and determining its direction. In recognition of this achievement, the Archaeological Institute of America is proud to present this award.</page><page sequence="7">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 261 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD WALTER V. ROBINSON Walter V. Robinson,journalist, is the first recipient of the Archaeological Institute of America's Award for Out- standing Public Service. Presented for exceptional contributions to the public understanding of and interest in archaeology, this award is given in recognition of the important series of articles written by Walter Robinson of the Boston Globe on the plunder of archaeological sites. Walter Robinson has devoted two decades of his professional career to reporting on local, national, and inter- national affairs for the Boston Globe. In addition to serving as the Globe's Bureau Chief at Boston City Hall and the Massachusetts State House, he has been the White House and national political correspondent during three Pres- idential campaigns. Robinson was Middle East Bureau Chief in Jerusalem, reporting on the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991. The paper's Assistant Managing Editor since 1993, he has been a roving foreign and national re- porter, and has written extensively on artworks stolen from victims of the Holocaust during World War II. His ar- ticles on the modern-day traffic in antiquities looted from archaeological sites have focused national scrutiny on a problem of worldwide concern. Walter Robinson's timely reports on the damaging effects of pillaging to supply the international trade in an- tiquities explore long-standing conflicts between countries rich in archaeological heritage and U.S. museums. Il- luminating the scope and inner workings of the illicit trade through front-page coverage of disputed objects from Central America, West Africa, South Italy, and Turkey, Robinson's skillfully researched articles have brought the cause of archaeology to audiences well beyond the Boston area. Together with Globe reporterJohn Yemma, he has covered Guatemala's recent attempts to recover its Mayan artifacts and has written as well about Mali's pursuit of its plundered patrimony. Two important investigative reports prepared by Robinson on location in Sicily trace artworks allegedly looted from the American excavations at Morgantina to prominent New York collections. Giv- ing voice to divergent perspectives, he demonstrates an impressive ability to elucidate the complex legal and eth- ical dilemmas that confront collectors, dealers, museums, and archaeologists. Dramatic discoveries of the evi- dence of past civilizations will continue to thrill audiences, but the probing inquiries of Walter Robinson encourage best practices and will help to safeguard this precious evidence for future generations. The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to bestow its first Award for Outstanding Public Service on Walter Robinson in recognition of his commitment to the values of archaeological research, the accountability of public institutions, and the education of the wider public.</page><page sequence="8">262 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA JAMES R. WISEMAN BOOK AWARD JANET DELAINE The Archaeological Institute of America is pleased to present the James R. Wiseman Book Award for 1998 to Janet DeLaine for her book The Baths of Caracalla: A Study in the Design, Construction, and Economics of Large-Scale Building Projects in Imperial Rome (JRA Suppl. 25, Portsmouth 1997). This book is a landmark study of a major im- perial Roman building-the Baths of Caracalla-by a scholar who is a trained civil engineer as well as a classicist- historian and an archaeologist. A combination of disciplinary modes are used in this volume to provide a truly in- tegrated picture of Roman public architecture-its design process, the economics of its construction, and the social and political implications of its existence. This is not a straightforward architectural analysis of the entire bath complex, but rather a discussion of as- pects of the project at large. Clearly written and superbly illustrated with plans drawn by the author, its detailed discussion of labor and economics provides insight into the building industry of Severan Rome, including infor- mation on how and where constructional materials were obtained, calculated estimates of the quantities of mate- rials used and manpower employed, as well as timetables for the schedule of construction-all questions that are not traditionally addressed by scholars. DeLaine's work demonstrates a totally new and exceptionally promising method of analyzing standing Ro- man buildings, one that breaks new ground in the examination of ancient architecture. This book not only changes the nature of the discipline, but it also raises the hurdles for anyone doing research in architectural and social history.</page><page sequence="9">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 263 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION lA: AIA PRESIDENTIAL COLLO- QUIUM: A CENTURY LATER: THE AIA ANNUAL MEETING LIBATION RITUALS AT INTERMENT? Two ARTIFACT TYPES FROM THE ROYAL CEMETERY OF UR AND THEIR FUNCTION: Irene J. Winte;, Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Harvard University In this paper I investigate the functions assigned to two object types found by Woolley in the Royal Cemetery graves of the Early Dynastic Period at Ur, suggest alterna- tives, and proceed to argue for the importance of studying deposition patterns in the archaeological distribution of artifacts in graves to reach a better understanding of their possible uses. I conclude by arguing for the performance of libation rituals at the moment of interment-acts that would complement the post-burial rituals performed to commemorate the deceased, which are well attested in cu- neiform texts, thus adding a temporal sequence to the larger package of ritual praxes associated with death in early Mesopotamia. THE OTHER DARK AGE: THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF CORINTH BETWEEN ANASTASIUS I AND MICHAEL II: Guy Sanders, Corinth Excavations, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Historical sources present a discouraging picture of the condition of southern Greece in the three centuries after 522. The historical orthodoxy for Corinth is a long period of desertion introduced by earthquakes, plague, and barbarian invasions at the end of the Roman period and followed by the introduction of a mature Byzantine culture from outside. Recent excavation and research at Corinth suggest that archaeology cannot entirely sustain the historical interpre- tation. Substantial buildings were being erected in the mid-sixth century, imported and domestic pottery se- quences continue into the mid-seventh century, and some tombs once considered fourth-sixth century in date can be redated to the late seventh-early ninth century. It is now clear that although the earthquake in 522 damaged the city, that of 552 had no serious effect. What was thought to be a plague pit of ca. 532 in the Lerna fountain tunnels is now dated to the later sixth century. Only one whole vessel and four sherds may reflect any "Slavic" pres- ence or influence. Given an unbroken sequence of burials down into the ninth century, there is no longer any reason to consider Corinth deserted in this period and the task of looking for domestic and other evidence of settlement has begun. The available material culture, however, is suggestive of a continuous development of Late Roman population and institutions rather than desertion and rehellenization. THE CAPITOLINE HILL IN ROME: Albert. Ammerman, Colgate University Much still remains to be learned about one of the most important hills in Rome even after several centuries of study. This report presents the results of the fieldwork that we have done on the Capitoline Hill since 1992. The work, for instance, has led to the first proper contour map of the natural relief of the hill-something not available in the literature before. Indeed, the literature-in part because of the long history of investigation itself-is often marked by misconceptions about the hill's size and shape, its geol- ogy, and the setting of major sites such as the Temple of luppiter Optimus Maximus. The report begins with a review of the various attempts since the Renaissance to recon- struct the original hill. New evidence drawn from a series of 51 deep machine-made cores now makes it possible to work out in detail the structure of the Capitoline Hill and to date the volcanic events that contributed to its forma- tion. Finally, some of the wider archaeological implications of the new knowledge are discussed with specific regard to early Rome: the best route for access to the top of the southern summit, the nature of the land surface at Colini's favissa site, and the setting of the Temple of Jupiter. The temple was located not in the center of the southern sum- mit, as commonly held; instead, it was situated on one side with an artificial terrace supporting its west corner. A CENTURY OF ARCHAEOLOGY AT CHACO CANYON, NEW MEXICO: Stephen H. Lekson, University of Colorado at Boulder Ten decades of research at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, produced a new and unexpected view of Pueblo Indian prehistory. Excavations sponsored by the American Mu- seum of Natural History (1896-1899) were the first of a se- ries of expeditions to Chaco, culminating in the National Park Service's Chaco Project (1971-1979). By 1980, Chaco Canyon emerged as a political capital and ceremonial city, unprecedented in the ancient Southwest. Research during the last two decades has shifted from Chaco Canyon to the regional context of this 12th-century great center. We now have fine-grained knowledge of the rise of Chaco Canyon as a ceremonial city, and we are developing a comparably detailed knowledge of the geography of the Chacoan world. Chaco was, perhaps, the seminal event of Pueblo prehistory, and the trajectories of later Pueblo life reflect Chaco's emergence, end, and memory. Subsequent politi- cal centers appealed to ancient Chaco for symbolic legiti-</page><page sequence="10">264 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 mation; what happened at Chaco shapes Pueblo govern- ment and society to the present. This presentation reviews Chacoan archaeology over the last hundred years, and previews startling new ideas about Chaco's place in New World prehistory. AMERICAN MUSEUMS AND THE ACQUISITION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL OBJECTS: Ricardo j Elia, Bos- ton University A paper by Sara Y. Stevenson, titled "Some Points of Mu- seum Policy" and presented at the first annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in 1899, provides a starting point for a centennial review of American museum acquisition policies and practices pertaining to antiquities. Despite some early efforts at sponsoring excavations as a way of obtaining antiquities, American art museums have always relied on the art market-either through direct purchases or through gifts from private collectors-as their primary source of archaeological acquisitions. In re- cent decades, increasing attention has focused on the harmful relationship between antiquities collecting and the looting of archaeological sites throughout the world. As archaeologists and countries of origin struggle to pro- tect and conserve archaeological sites, monuments, and objects, some museums and museum organizations have adopted codes of ethics that discourage the acquisition of looted material. In contrast to these protective efforts, however, many American art museums not only continue to acquire unprovenienced, undocumented antiquities in the same way that they did a hundred years ago, but are currently in the midst of a vigorous campaign to protect their traditional methods of acquiring plundered archaeo- logical objects.

SESSION 1B: COLLOQUIUM: ARCHAEOL- OGY IN CHINA AND VIETNAM: A NEW CHAPTER INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ARCHAEOLOGY AT NIUHELIANG, A CEREMONIAL SITE OF THE HONGSHAN CULTURE: Sarah M. Nelson, Univer- sity of Denver, and Guo Dashun, Liaoning Prov- ince Archaeological Research Institute The site of Niuheliang, in Liaoning province in north- eastern China, is a large ceremonial center with a central building known as the Goddess Temple because of the fragments of a life-sized statue of a woman found there, to- gether with pieces of other statues. Other features include an artificial hill and at least 13 areas of large stone- mounded tombs containing graves with jade ornaments as the only grave goods. Huge numbers of pottery cylinders, some of them painted black on red, encircle these tombs, sometimes in several rows. Chinese excavation crews have investigated many of these areas. The international crew focused on an area on the slope behind the Goddess Temple. This is a raised platform with stone edging, which is about 100 m on each side. It may represent two or three different raised areas where unknown activities took place. We hypothesize that it may be the locus of elite living quar- ters and/or workshops to manufacture the jade artifacts, pottery cylinders, and unbaked clay statues found else- where in the site. The first year entailed nondestructive ar- chaeology to learn the shape of what is beneath the ground: ground-penetrating radar, magnetometer read- ings, and resistivity survey. Maps made from these activities are the subject of this presentation. GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT SHANG- QIU AND ANYANG, CHINA: George Rapp, Jr, and ZhichunJing, University of Minnesota, Duluth The Shangqiu Project is a cooperative project of the Chinese Institute of Archaeology, Harvard University, and the Archaeometry Laboratory of the University of Minne- sota, Duluth, with the Archaeometry Laboratory respon- sible for the geoarchaeological exploration component. The focus of this project is an attempt to locate the deeply buried capital of the first Shang Dynasty, thought to be sit- uated in the vicinity of Shangqiu, Henan province. Core drilling over a period of six years, with associated remote sensing, has located a major site, now thought to be the "Great City Song" of the later Eastern Zhou Dynasty. City walls of rammed earth have been located, and minimal ex- cavation has been undertaken. The Anyang Project is an interdisciplinary joint re- search effort between the Chinese Institute of Archaeology and the Archaeometry Laboratory. Anyang has a special place in Old World archaeology. Excavations since 1928 have unearthed large architectural foundations, numerous major bronze vessels, chariots, uncounted fine ceramics, more than 100,000 oracle bones, and a plethora of human skeletons. The goals of the current project, begun in 1997, are to add a major archaeological science compo- nent to the ongoing archaeological investigations, and to undertake a major geoarchaeological survey of the Anyang region. INVESTIGATIONS INTO EARLY SHANG CIVILIZA- TION: A SINo-U.S. COLLABORATIVE FIELD PRO- GRAM IN THE NORTH CHINA PLAIN: Robert E. Murowchich, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University The ongoing collaborative field program between the Peabody Museum (Harvard University) and the Institute of Archaeology (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing) seeks to shed light on the cultural chronology of the heavily alluviated eastern part of Henan province,</page><page sequence="11">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 265 China, and to locate and investigate sites of the poorly un- derstood predynastic and early dynastic periods of the Shang civilization (ca. 2000-1500 B.C.). The project, based near the city of Shangqiu Xian, involves an extensive program of geological coring to reconstruct the ancient to- pography, and geophysical remote sensing (radar, resistiv- ity, magnetometry, EM, and aerial/satellite image analysis) to locate subsurface features. Archaeological excavations at Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Shangqiu District have clarified the pre-Shang sequence, including a rich Long- shan settlement at Zhecheng Shantaisi (with evidence of ritual activity very similar to that practiced by Shang); a Yangshao/Dawenkou cemetery at Yucheng Mazhuang; and Yueshi cultural strata at Shangqiu Panmiao. The dis- covery of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty city of Song and its ini- tial excavations have verified the existence of this historic city, which some ancient texts say was built on top of the site of Dayi Shang, or "Great City Shang." Dayi Shang is mentioned in Shang and other early texts as the ritual and political center of the Shang culture during its predynastic phase, and as the preeminent ritual center of Shang after the political center moved to other cities throughout the dynastic reign. Its discovery would shed new information on the formation of the Shang culture. REGIONAL LIFEWAYS AND CULTURAL REMAINS IN THE NORTHERN CORRIDOR OF CHINA: A COOP- ERATIVE PROJECT: Katheryn M. Linduff Uni- versity of Pittsburgh We know that agro-pastoralism and/or nomadic lifeways emerged in the Northern Corridor, but how that hap- pened has not been studied using systematic field meth- ods. The goal of a cooperative project of the University of Pittsburgh,Jilin University, and Hebrew University is to put into regional context the relevant archaeological materials already accumulated and, by using regional survey meth- ods followed by test excavations, to investigate systemati- cally the emergence of pastoralism in two targeted areas. We consider in this paper the processes by which the small-scale societies in these two areas made the relatively rapid transition to complex societies before the third cen- tury B.C. The time depth and research questions touch upon fundamental issues relevant to the historical, art his- torical, and anthropological study of many human socie- ties in the world. The central issues addressed are 1) the emergence of pastoral cultures and the social, economic, and cultural patterns of these cultures; 2) the relationship between pastoral and agricultural societies, with a focus on exchange between ancient China and the borderlands; and 3) the role of interaction in relation to the rise of com- plex societies in the research areas. The first phase of the project is designed to test the his- torical notion about what constitutes typical interaction be- tween pastoral and agricultural groups in Chinese history and about how alternate lifeways emerged. Research fo- cuses on eastern Inner Mongolia and the contiguous areas of Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, incorporating the results of previous survey, recent intensive survey, targeted test exca- vations, and analysis of artifacts. Negotiating and arrang- ing to work in China take special care and patience-the trials, tribulations, and techniques needed to obtain per- mission to carry out this project are reviewed as well. THREE GORGES ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE FATE OF CHINA'S SOUTHERN HERITAGE: Elizabeth Childs- Johnson, New York University The potential for further archaeological discovery in the Three Gorges area of the middle Yangzi River valley is considerable. Excavations primarily of burials, including a few from the royal cemetery at Xiaotianxi, Fuling, Sichuan, show that the people and culture, known through later his- tories as Ba, formed a powerful kingdom that interacted with their better-known western and eastern neighbors, the Shu and the Chu, during the Chunqiu and Warring States periods (ca. 741-221 B.C.). An idiosyncratic script and set of bronze war implements distinguish the Ba from their neighbors. Excavations have also provided data to document that the Ba were related to those who settled along the Yangzi much earlier, during the Neolithic and Bronze Age (ca. 3500-800 B.C.). These excavations, how- ever, are preliminary. We know these eras primarily through piecemeal finds of painted pots, mythologically figurative jades, and large-scale ritual bronzes, types that also characterize the more thoroughly excavated northern part of China. Chinese archaeologists have surveyed but still not excavated major, large-scale Neolithic and Bronze Age sites such as Lijiaba, Shuangyantang, Luoguanmiao, and Ganjinggou, which dot the Yangzi from western Hubei and the Three Gorges west and south to Zhongxian and Fuling in eastern Sichuan. If we are to understand the southern origins of Chinese civilization, we must not only document previously unearthed remains but also excavate major sites and more burial areas before this area is inun- dated in 2009 with the construction of the Three Gorges dam and reservoir. PUTTING INTO CONTEXT THE MUMMIES OF XIN- JIANG: Irene Good, University of Pennsylvania The nature of archaeological data is such that the ar- chaeologist is accustomed to trace remains, and works comfortably with a "porous" or open form of hypothesis that is easily mutable, according to the most current state of gathered data and interpretive methods. As new data are incorporated, the hypothesis is either reinforced and clarified or restructured. This is the nature of Western sci- entific method, particularly with regard to archaeological inquiry. Sometimes, however, the circumstances are quite the opposite. The Tarim Basin mummies represent just such a circumstance: we have at our disposal a wealth of ex- tremely unusual finds, almost perfectly preserved, relating to mortuary behavior of a cluster of cultures otherwise vir- tually unknown. In this paper, these recent discoveries made by Chinese and Uighur archaeologists are put into perspective. Problems of chronology, context, curatorship, and cultural heritage, as well as international press atten- tion, serve as investigational impediments but also as op- portunities for intellectual exchange.</page><page sequence="12">266 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 THE DONGSON ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT OF VIETNAM: FIELD INVESTIGATIONS IN THE RED RIVER DELTA: Francis Allard, University of Pitts- burgh, and Brian Vincent, University of Otago The Bronze Age archaeological culture of Dongson, centered in northern Vietnam and dated to the second half of the first millennium B.C., has attracted much atten- tion as a result of the rich and distinctive material culture recovered from its burials. A collaborative project with the Institute of Archaeology of Vietnam aims to clarify the na- ture and development of Dongson culture, along with the multifaceted impact that the early Chinese presence had on it. The field project focuses on a 200-km2 area of the Red River delta east of Hanoi where the Chinese are be- lieved to have established a capital prior to the Christian era. In this paper, we discuss the results of the recently con- ducted first phase of the project, and consider how a range of methods to be employed over the length of the project will contribute to achieving significant results. These in- clude a systematic survey of the area, a detailed geomorpho- logical study, excavations, ceramic and metals analysis, pol- len analysis, and the use of historical texts and early maps to clarify the topographical features (relief and hydrology) of the early delta at the time of Dongson occupation. SESSION iD: NUMISMATICS A NEW LOOK AT AN OLD HOARD: SILVER FROM ZINJIRLI: Christine M. Thompson, Tufts University Barrekub, son of Panamuwa, ruled Zinjirli as a vassal to the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser in 730 B.C. The three "cake ingots" inscribed in Aramaic, "belonging to Bar- rekub" or "on behalf of Barrekub," found in the North Pal- ace of this small kingdom in the Taurus Mountains are well known as possible representatives of the first coinage, but little has been published about the other pieces of silver currency found with them. A total of 178 pieces of uncoined silver from Zinjirli were available for study at the Vorderasiatisches Museen in Berlin during September 1997. These were compared to similarly shaped objects from hoards of uncoined silver brought to light by recent excavations in the Near East. The types of uncoined silver in these hoards have often been loosely referred to as Hacksilber, or scrap. Here, the more descriptive names of distinctive ingot shapes, such as the "rolled tongues" found at Ekron and Nush-iJan, are re- viewed and new names for other frequently recurring ingot shapes are proposed. In addition, the possible mone- tary functions ofjewelry contained within these hoards are explored in material and textual contexts. When understood in conjunction with what other cur- rency and coin hoards demonstrate, the uncoined silver from Zinjirli is able to shed new light on the possible func- tion of the inscribed "cake ingots" as stored wealth rather than coin and calls into question linear conceptions of the development of coinage. CYPRIOTS IN CILICIA: A RARE COIN OF ANEMOU- RION: Mary-Grace Weir, Princeton University, and James Russell, University of British Columbia In 1915 the Mfinzkabinett of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin acquired a unique silver coin of Anemourion (inv. 857/1915). On the obverse appears a laureate head of Apollo with the legend NIAOKY-HPOI (or OY); the re- verse, inscribed AN[EM]QPIEQN, depicts a naked strik- ing Herakles with club and bow. Everything about the coin- its style, size and weight appropriate to a Persian stater, and the local significance of the two legends-is consistent with a source in coastal Cilicia, a region of the Persian empire with a well-established tradition of Hellenization. Both obverse and reverse quite closely resemble similar images on city coins of Cyprus (e.g., from Marion, Kition, Lapethos) dated to the early fourth century B.C. The Ber- lin stater would thus provide the earliest evidence for the existence of the Cilician city of Anemourion, antedating the earliest written record of the city's existence (Pseudo- Skylax 102), from around the mid-fourth century. The name Philokypros associated with Apollo on the ob- verse indicates some connection with Cyprus, 40 miles by sea from Anemourion. Although Philokypros is well at- tested as a Cypriot personal name both on Cyprus and else- where from the sixth century B.C. until Roman times, there is good reason to associate the striking of a coin link- ing coastal Cilicia with Cyprus in the early fourth century with the known activities of King Evagoras of Salamis on the mainland. EMPERORS, ORACLES, AND THE COINS OF THE NEW PYTHIAN GAMES: Robert Weir, University of Victoria Scattered evidence attests to the establishment of ath- letic festivals called Pythian Games at over 20 cities of the eastern Roman empire between the late second and mid- third century A.D., but no study has yet examined the phe- nomenon as a whole. In this paper I collect and compare the primarily numismatic evidence for Pythian Games at two well-attested venues, Thessalonike and Side, to illus- trate the level of similarity between them and the signifi- cance of each festival in its local context. Die studies show that most Pythian Games coinages were very limited in vol- ume and thus of symbolic, not economic, importance for their issuing cities. Thessalonike was exceptional for its va- riety and abundance of reverse types with allusions to the local Pythian festival. Furthermore, the evidence of ico- nography and inscriptions shows that an adventus of Gor- dian III and his army in A.D. 242 is likely to have occa- sioned both the festival's foundation and the coins to commemorate it. On the other hand, the Pythian Games featured less prominently among the coins of Side; but their reverses and the epigraphic record do prove the in- volvement of Delphi's oracle and the elite of Side, though not an emperor, in the founding and maintenance of its Pythian festival. Although the new Pythian Games through- out the Roman empire were surely inspired by the Delphic original, there was clearly scope for each host city to tailor the festival to suit its own sense of civic identity.</page><page sequence="13">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 267 CONTORNIATES: SOME NEW EVIDENCE FROM CARTHAGE: Liane R. Houghtalin and John D. Mac Isaac, Mary Washington College Among the finds of recent years in the excavations of the Yasmina necropolis at Carthage (sponsored by the Uni- versity of Georgia, Athens, and directed by N. Norman) were a pair of contorniates. These pieces replicate known sestertii of Trajan and Hadrian, without the inscriptions found on those true coins, and have the characteristic raised rims of the contorniate. This, the eldest class of ex- onummia, has never previously been found in North Af- rica. In fact, this pair represents only the third instance of recovery of their kind in an archaeological context any- where. This discovery occasions a review of what we know about the nature of this unusual class in the Roman numis- matic corpus. Since the publication of Elizabeth and An- dreas Alfoldi's Die Kontorniatmedaillen (Berlin 1972), much attention has been paid to those authors' radical interpre- tation of the use of these pieces (anti-Christian propa- ganda) or to an ongoing attempt to purge the body of known examples of their Renaissance and later imitations. The types of the Yasmina contorniates are not among the entries in the Alfoldi's exhaustive work but, nonetheless, provide a number of touchstones in dating, method of manufacture, and subject material that allow us to suggest some adjustments to their conclusions. The value of ar- chaeological discoveries in supplementing purely numis- matic research is plainly demonstrated. THE NUMISMATIC FINDS FROM AMORIUM: NEW EVI- DENCE FOR THE BYZANTINE MONETARY ECON- OMY: E.A. Ivison, City University of New York, and Chris Lightfoot, University of Durham The question of the survival of coinage as the principal form of exchange in the Byzantine empire, especially dur- ing the so-called Dark Ages (seventh-eighth century A.D.), is one that has vexed medieval historians for de- cades. Over 30 years ago Speris Vryonis stated in a lecture delivered in Ankara that "it would be of considerable inter- est to have a general tabulation of Byzantine coins in the various collections and museums of Anatolia at the present." Despite the importance of such work for the study of the survival of a monetary economy and the continued exist- ence of urban sites in Anatolia during the Byzantine pe- riod, little progress has been made until the last few years. Now, however, the Byzantine coins in several Turkish muse- ums have been studied. Those in the Amasya Museum have already been published and similar catalogues of the collections in the museums of Sinop, Fethiye, and Afyon are presently being prepared. In addition, the coins in the municipal museum at Bolvadin have recently been re- corded. This work was carried out as part of the Amorium Project, which conducts excavations at the principal Byzan- tine site in Anatolia. Excavations at Amorium since 1988 have produced a total of 252 coins, of which nearly two-thirds have been identified as Byzantine (seventh-llth century A.D.). The evidence forms a pattern quite unlike that from other sites, both in Anatolia and in Greece, where the medieval coin finds have been published. SESSION 1E: CERAMICS AND TRADE THE TRANSPORT AMPHORAS FROM THE LATE FIFTH-CENTURY B.C. SHIPWRECK OFF ALONNE- sos, NORTHERN SPORADES: Eleftheria Mantzouka- Syson, East Carolina University In the summers of 1992 and 1993, personnel from the De- partment of Maritime Antiquities in Athens, under the di- rection of Elpida Hadjidakis, excavated a late fifth-century B.C. shipwreck found off the island of Alonnesos. A mound of amphoras 25 X 12 m in extent marks the site, lying on a sloping sandy bottom 22-33 m in depth. Besides other preliminary work, the team established a 72-section rope grid over the mound and labeled 976 surface amphoras. The site contains approximately 4,000 amphoras arranged in three or four layers. Only two sections were fully excavated, yielding 140 transport amphoras identified primarily as Mendean and Peparethian. Most of them are intact and in good condi- tion. This presentation focuses on the amphoras, their ori- gin, composition, typology, and capacity as well as method- ological aspects of their examination and problems encountered during their study. The Alonnesos shipwreck is significant for two reasons: the site contains Mendean and Peparethian amphoras that total a greater carrying capacity than found at any site, and the ship that carried the amphoras and other cargo ap- pears to have been larger than any fifth-century B.C. ship- wreck yet discovered. KILNS AND POTTERY PRODUCTION AT LEPTIMI- NUS: RESULTS OF THE 1998 EXCAVATION SEA- SON: Lea M. Stirling, University of Manitoba, and Nejib Ben Lazreg, Institut national du patri- moine de Tunisie In 1995 and 1996, excavation on the periphery of the ancient city of Leptiminus exposed two circular updraft kilns of the Roman period (AJA 101 [1997] 372). In 1998, excavation continued at the same site to investigate addi- tional kilns and workspaces. It is essential to study the kilns not as isolated structures but as part of a wider potting complex, itself located in an urban context under study through field survey (AJA 99 [1995] 352). Two new kilns were excavated, bringing the total known at the site to seven. They were quite large, with a diameter of 4-5 m. In one, a central brick hub and remains of brick vaulting were found. Sherds of stamped Africana II A and D amphoras were found on the floor of this kiln. West of the kilns, steps cut into the bedrock led to an under- ground chamber or passage. A nearby building was appar- ently used for pottery manufacture; unfired coarseware sherds were found there.</page><page sequence="14">268 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 Some evidence of phasing appeared in the area west of the kilns. Damaged mosaic floors (surely not part of an in- dustrial structure) were laid over deposits containing kiln brick and wasters. Three graves cut the mosaic floor. Thus, the industrial phase appears to have been followed by a do- mestic phase and then a cemetery phase. The ceramics from all phases (under study byJ. Moore and A. Opait) ap- pear to date broadly to the second and third century, sug- gesting that the chronology was quite compact. THE CONTINUITY OF INLAND TRADE IN SUB-ROMAN NORTH AFRICA: WAS THE BREADBASKET LEFT HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL? TD. C. Barnes, Uni- versity of Nottingham Africa Proconsularis was the "breadbasket" of Rome and the source of Africa's prosperity and prestige. But after the decline of the Roman empire, was Africa left holding the proverbial basket? The continuation, alteration, or cessation of the inland markets and routes will have influ- enced the sub-Roman economy. In this paper, I examine the evidence for continuing ag- ricultural production and supply, as well as movement of the produce from the rich cereal lands in the hinterland toward the lucrative coastal markets. The amphora assem- blages from Carthage and other harbors provide an index of the transported produce-a witness to the movement of certain valuable goods. I also discuss the maintenance and survival of market towns in the hinterland and the extent to which their survival rested on the fate of the export mar- ket. The interruption and reduction of the late sixth-century export market, as seen in the pottery assemblages from coastal cities, induce a similar contraction in the market towns of the hinterland. SICILIAN NAXIAN WINE AMPHORAs: A NEW LOOK AT WINE IN NORTH AFRICA: Joann Freed, Wilfrid Laurier University, and R.J.A. Wilson, University of Nottingham In 1979, Riley labeled a loosely defined class of small flat-bottomed amphoras at Benghazi "Mid-Roman Am- phora 1"; his distribution map for the class shows a central Mediterranean distribution. Earlier, Panella had illus- trated three amphoras belonging to this class at Ostia (StMisc 1973, 632, nos. 44-46), distinguishing Ostia III.44- 45 from Ostia 111.46. Her dating evidence ranged from the first to the fourth century A.D., and she thought a North African provenance likely. The forms of the rims, handles, and bases are distinctive and easily recognized and a fairly fine red fabric with paler slip is characteristic, but the class is thin-walled and the am- phoras break up easily, so that a complete profile is rare. Published petrological analyses, which indicate micaceous, and therefore not North African, fabrics, are not linked to a specific type. In 1990, Wilson published his observation of kiln wasters of Ostia III.44-45 from Naxos, a Sicilian coastal site south of Taormina. The find proves that at least part of the pro- duction of this amphora type is Sicilian. Naxos is the cen- ter of a wine-producing region, suggesting that Ostia III.44-45 held wine. In this paper we combine our knowledge of amphoras of these types from excavations in Sicily and Carthage in order to identify the fabric of specific types and to clarify the evidence for a wine trade among Sicily, peninsular Italy, and North Africa. BEEHIVES, HONEY, AND THE WHOLE BALL OF WAX: Jane Francis, Concordia University Beekeeping in western Crete has been illuminated by the Sphakia Survey's discovery of nearly 500 fragments of ancient ceramic beehives ranging from the Classical to Byzantine period. These fragments follow the typical Med- iterranean type: long tubes with a flaring rim and rough scoring on portions of their interior; extension tubes were also found-short cylinders with plain rims. These are smaller than Attic beehives but comparable in size and shape to other Cretan examples. The value of beekeeping in antiquity is well established: honey was in constant demand, and ancient references and archaeological evidence all confirm Sphakia's reputa- tion as a major producer. It is not only for honey, however, that beekeeping warrants a closer look. One of the major commodities used in the artistic world was wax, particu- larly for the manufacture of sculpture. The production of bronze statuary required wax for models; the encaustic technique used wax mixed with pigments; and ganosis of- fered a smooth, shiny, waxen finish to stone sculpture. This aspect of beekeeping is never considered, yet the necessity for large quantities of wax must have heightened the value of bees because of the economic importance of their every by-product. This paper presents the Sphakia beehives, ex- plores the uses of wax in Greek art, and considers the trade in beeswax around the ancient world. THE SUPPLY OF CERAMICS AND RELATED GOODS TO POMPEII DURING THE LATE REPUBLICAN AND EARLY IMPERIAL PERIODS: EVIDENCE FROM THE CASA DELLE VESTALI: Eric C. De Sena, University of Bradford The recent Anglo-American excavations of the Casa delle Vestali, Regio VI, Insula 1 at Pompeii, has seen the re- covery of a large assemblage of domestic pottery and trans- port amphoras from well-stratified deposits. The ceramic evidence is shedding considerable light upon the pro- cesses involved in the formation of the property and struc- tures on which the Casa delle Vestali is situated. It is hoped that the study of this pottery assemblage will also contrib- ute to a more complete understanding of the broader so- cioeconomic conditions of Pompeii and the Bay of Naples. This report provides a preliminary assessment of the supply of pottery and related agricultural goods to Pompeii from the Late Republican period to the eruption of Vesuvius, based upon the ceramic evidence from the Casa delle Vestali excavations. This period is an especially crucial one in the economic history of Rome, having seen the height and decline of Italy as the significant manufac- turing entity of agricultural and craft goods in the Mediter- ranean and the rise of Hispania and Africa Proconsularis as dominant economic forces. The chief objectives of this</page><page sequence="15">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 269 study are to indicate the trade patterns of domestic wares and transport amphoras during this period and discuss the trends in light of broader political and economic events. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between im- ported and regionally manufactured pottery. Ceramic production groups are currently being estab- lished through macroscopic and microscopic analyses, as well as a limited program of petrographic analysis that is being performed in the archaeometry laboratory of the Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei, Ercolano e Stabia. A REASSESSMENT OF SO-CALLED ARRETINE CERAM- IC PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH ASIA: THE AFGHAN CONNECTION: Charles C. Kolb, National Endowment for the Humanities During three field seasons (1966-1968) in northern Af- ghanistan, ceramic artifacts were recovered from caves and open-air sites excavated by personnel of the Prehistoric Re- search in Afghanistan Project of the American Museum of Natural History. The ceramic materials span the eras from the ceramic Neolithic (beginning ca. 5200 B.C.) to the present, and include whole vessels, sherds, and fired clay figurines. Pottery vessels dating to the Iron Age in north- ern Afghanistan came from transit loci and human inter- ments situated on major trade routes, including the so- called "Silk Route." The initial ceramic analysis resulted in the identification of more than 50 ceramic types, including Red Streak-Burnished ware, which was apparently derived from Roman Arretine/Eastern Sigillata prototypes. Since 1991, political changes in Central Asia resulting in the for- mation of independent polities and the diminution of hos- tilities in Afghanistan have resulted in greater access to col- lections and the publication of reports on excavated materials. Relevant archaeological data are now available from the independent states of Kazakstan, Kyrgizstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as from Pakistan. In addition, new excavations have led to a reassess- ment of imported and locally made Roman ceramics recov- ered from Arikamedu, a seaport located on the southeast- ern coast of India. This new information is incorporated into a reassessment of the earlier conclusions about over- land and maritime contact between the eastern Mediterra- nean and India in the first centuries B.C. and A.D. SESSION 1F: (RE)INTERPRETATIONS OF GREEK SCULPTURE PROBLEMS OF THE CLASSICAL PEPLOPHOROS: Mireille M. Lee, Bryn Mawr College The peplophoros is conventionally defined as a female figure wearing a pinned woolen garment that is frequently girded and sometimes worn with an overfold. "Peplo- phoros" is not an ancient term, but was invented around the turn of the century. The term and the type, while stan- dard, are highly problematic. The garment was not identi- fied as a peplos until 1886, when F. Studniczka argued that it was the same as the "Dorian chiton." The overfold of the garment is frequently identified as the "apoptygma," a misnomer resulting from a misunderstanding of epi- graphic evidence. Reconsideration of the textual evidence for peploi sug- gests further that the word peplos cannot be identified ex- clusively with the garment to which it has been linked. In classical tragedy peploi are frequently identified as linen and are worn by men as well as women. Peploi are used for other purposes as well, as swaddling clothes for infants, as shrouds for the dead, and as fabric panels for the banquet tent in Euripides' Ion. Although some have argued that the simple form of the peplos allowed for multiple uses of the garment, it is equally likely that the term peplos had a more general meaning and did not identify a specific type of garment. The archaeological evidence for peploi is also problem- atic. Although pinned garments appear in classical sculp- ture and painting, dress fasteners are conspicuously absent from the archaeological record of that period. The dearth of actual pins suggests that the so-called peplophoros does not record a fashion favored by women at that time, but that it represents an iconographic construct involving this simple garment. WRESTLER TO RUNNER: A GRAVESTONE FROM THE ATHENIAN AGORA AND A NEW INTERPRETATION OF AN ATHLETIC TYPE: Janet Burnett Grossman, J. Paul Getty Museum Among the sculptures discovered in the excavations of the Athenian Agora is a fragment (no. S 379) of a grave- stone that depicts the lower torso and upper legs of a nude man. Enough remains to reconstruct a pose that is nearly identical to that of a figure shown on the grave stele of Agakles in the Athens National Museum (no. 2004). Since its discovery in Attica in 1857, the Agakles stele has been thought to depict uniquely on a grave monument a nude athlete in a pose interpreted by scholars as either that of a wrestler, pankratiast, or ball catcher (C. Clairmont, Classi- cal Attic Tombstones I [Kilchberg 1993] 238-39, no. 1.100). The appearance now of a second grave monument with similar iconography presents an opportunity to reconsider the interpretation of this type of figure. The man leans for- ward in a slightly crouched position, left leg in front of the right and both arms held out in front at about eye level. According to both literary (e.g., Philostr. On Gymnastics 32-33) and visual references (e.g., bronze statuette from Olympia, A. Mallwitz and H.-V. Herrmann eds., Funde aus Olympia [Athens 1980] 157, pl. 107.2), this erect stance is typical of ancient runners lining up at a starting line. A comparison of the bodies and poses of the men on these gravestones with other depictions of runners supports an identification of Agakles and the man on the Agora stone as runners in starting position for a race. ATHLETE OR APOLLO? CASES OF MISTAKEN IDEN- TITY: Catherine M. Keesling, Georgetown University The reader of almost any catalogue of small bronze stat- uettes from the Archaic and Classical periods will find mul- tiple examples identified as athletes. Renate Thomas, in Athletenstatuetten der Spitarchaik und des strengen Stils (Rome</page><page sequence="16">270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 1981), outlines two broad categories of male athletic repre- sentations. Statuettes of the first group exhibit action poses that correlate with typical Greek athletic events-they in- clude discus throwers, runners, jumpers, and even racers in armor (hoplitodromoi). Statuettes of the second group are young, nude male figures standing at rest, and extend- ing one or both arms forward to hold objects that have, for the most part, been lost. Examples of the latter group, which Thomas calls "Athleten-kuroi," are typically labeled "athletes" in publications despite the fact that their poses do not suggest any specific athletic event. These young, nude male statuettes not characterized as athletes by their poses deserve a closer look. Even when their handheld attributes have been lost, the positions of the statuettes' arms can be used to group multiple exam- ples into distinct categories. Using the resulting typology, clear analogues for some arm poses can be found in extant sculptural, vase, and coin representations of Apollo. In particular, certain two-handed combinations suggest the presence of Apollo's characteristic attributes: bow, kithara, laurel branch, and phiale. Unlike most Greek marble sculptures, the bronze statuettes of the Archaic and Classi- cal periods encourage a typology based upon their identi- ties, revealed by poses and by handheld objects that origi- nally served as identifying attributes. Applying this approach to male statuettes suggests that a large percent- age of "athletes" should be reidentified as small-scale vo- tive Apollos. THE MISSING DECK OF THE VICTORY OF SAMO- THRACE: Ira S. Mark, New York University When Charles Champoiseau transported the prow of the Victory of Samothrace to Paris in 1879, he left behind an enormous block of Lartian marble from the center of the deck. A Lartian block on Samothrace, now in two pieces and broken at one end (inv. 78.10 and 78.11), is ei- ther part of that very block or another block of very similar form. There is a plinth cutting in the Samothrace block with a preserved depth of 0.044-0.073 m, and the statue there bedded was secured by two massive dowels. If 78.10 and 78.11 are not from the prow of the Victory, their close mirroring of the remains in Paris offers at least indirect confirmation for the view that the Louvre Victory stood directly on the deck, as in the initial museum display of 1880-1883. Observation of the toolings on the deck of the Louvre prow supports that placement, although they indicate that the statue was further to the stern than ini- tially installed. Two alternative restorations of the monument appear implausible. In a study of 1931, Hermann Thiersch thought to identify the remains of the plinth cutting for the statue in a low course of Lartian marble unearthed by Cham- poiseau at the findspot of the Victory in 1891 (Paris, Lou- vre, Ma 4194, ex no. 2373). Thiersch restored the inscrip- tion on this fragment, --]g 'P6&amp;og, as the signature of the well-attested early second-century Rhodian sculptor Py- thokritos son of Timocharis. The plinth cutting is for a small-scale sculpture, however. It may be from a dedication that stood within the architectural setting of the Victory, but it is not from the monument itself. The second proposal raises the statue a full course above the deck on a high modern base. This is how the statue has been installed in the Louvre since 1934. The ad- justment to the display was partly for aesthetic reasons. The visitor approaches the monument up a grand stair- case, and the base helps compensate for this. But the change was also justified in nautical terms: the block was identified with a forecastle. The Louvre prow represents a trihemiolia, a light, narrow- hulled warship that was prized in antiquity for its speed and maneuverability. Forecastles or towers are attested for larger warships in the Hellenistic period, but there is no in- dication that trihemioliai were ever outfitted with them, and they indeed seem inappropriate for this class of ves- sel. If 78.10 and 78.11 are not in fact from the block left on Samothrace by Champoiseau, they indicate a place- ment for the statue much as one would conclude from other evidence. SCULPTED VICTORY MONUMENTS AND WAR MEMO- RIALS IN THE HELLENISTIC WORLD: E.E. Rice, Oxford University Although major Hellenistic victory monuments such as those dedicated by the Pergamene kings to commemorate their victories over the Gauls are rightly acclaimed, their iconography belongs more to the earlier Classical trend of "generic" representation in which mythology and heroiz- ing legend play a leading role in symbolizing the success of contemporary victors over the vanquished. This harks back to the type of victory monument conceived by fifth-century Athens after the Persian Wars. Certain trends toward "spe- cific" representations of historical events can be pin- pointed in the Late Classical period and in monuments associated with Alexander the Great, such as the Spartan Aigospotamoi dedication at Delphi, Alexander's Granikos monument at Dion, and Alexander's Funeral Carriage. Ev- idence for royal victory monuments and war memorials from the three major Hellenistic kingdoms comes to us in- directly from literary sources, but various monuments from civic contexts exist that bear witness to the continua- tion of the generic type of iconography. Monuments wor- thy of consideration in this light include the Colossus of Rhodes, the Rhodian Chariot of Helios at Delphi, Ship Dedications at Delos and Samothrace, and various Lion Monuments, including the Lion Tomb at Knidos, which links the study of war memorials to that of monumental tombs. The increasing diversity and individuality of tomb design in the Hellenistic period allowed for new repre- sentations of military victory to be portrayed. Finally, Hel- lenistic commemorations of victory influenced Roman victory monuments and the tradition of Roman narrative art beginning with the Monument of L. Aemilius Paullus at Delphi. KELES SCULPTURAL DEDICATIONS: HELLENISTIC IMAGES OF EQUESTRIAN AGONISTIC VICTORY: Sean Hemingway, Harvard University Art Museums This paper is concerned with a specific class of eques- trian statues made in commemoration of victory in the</page><page sequence="17">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 271 single-horse races (keles events) at the panhellenic games and local festivals throughout the ancient Greek world. Unlike civic and military equestrian statues, Greek eques- trian agonistic statuary has received little attention. Al- though few keles sculptural dedications of the Hellenistic period are preserved, it is possible to gain some under- standing of this important class of equestrian statuary through a careful synthesis of epigraphic and literary ev- idence and fragmentary remains from the archaeologi- cal record. A tradition of keles sculptural dedications can be traced back at least to the Late Archaic statues of victorious horses and horses with jockeys, most of which appear to have been considerably under life-size. Statue types of the Clas- sical period, known only from literary and epigraphic sources, include a horse-and-jockey type, as well as portrait statues of the owner, sometimes standing with the victori- ous horse and jockey. Horse racing reached the height of its popularity during the Hellenistic period when the equestrian events of the panhellenic sanctuaries were en- larged to their fullest extent. Races associated with local festivals are attested at more sites than at any other time in antiquity. Sculptural types of the Classical period contin- uied to be made and bronze statues of victorious owners were particularly common. It is argued that the horse-and- jockey type is represented by at least one extant group, the famous bronzes from the shipwreck off Cape Artemision. CULT-STATUE BASES WITH RELIEF DECORATION: ICONOGRAPHY AND FUNCTION: Angeliki Kosmo- poulou, American School of Classical Studies at Athens In recent years there has been renewed interest in Clas- sical cult-statue bases, stimulated in part by the ongoing restoration of the Rhamnous base. Relevant studies focus predominantly on the reconstruction of the original ap- pearance of individual carved pedestals and, to a lesser de- gree, on their interpretation. In this paper, a brief overview of all available evidence regarding cult-statue bases-actual remains and literary sources, as well as presumed reflections in later works of art-serves as the starting point in order to assess their ico- nography and function collectively. The monumental re- lief bases are discussed as an integral part of the statuary they supported, as well as a fundamental component of the overall iconographic program of the temples that hosted them. I propose that their introduction in Athens in the second half of the fifth century B.C. is linked with a shift in the character of cult images from purely religious into civic monuments that expressed political and social messages and demonstrated an enormous display of wealth for pro- pagandistic reasons. Furthermore, I suggest that the imag- ery of relief cult-statue bases, which evolved around mytho- logical scenes, specifically births of deities and conflicts between divine and monstrous beings, operated at mul- tiple semantic levels, carrying religious symbolism illumi- nating the nature of each divinity, as well as civic and polit- ical allusions to the city's origin, tradition, recent history, and institutions. Miraculous creation, divine retribution, and the restoration of moral order are identified as com- mon underlying themes of the narrative scenes, appropri- ate to illustrate divine power. SESSION iG: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ROMAN PROVINCES PETRA: BROWN UNIVERSITY EXCAVATIONS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE: Joseph J. Basile, Maryland Institute, and Martha SharpJoukowsky, Brown University In 1997, the Brown University excavations at Petra intro- duced the spectacular discovery of a theater-like structure located inside the Great Temple. Clear evidence, both stratigraphic and artifactual, shows that this structure was constructed in the second phase of temple building, which is dated to the first century B.C. One of the main objectives of the project is to reconstruct and interpret the changes in the temple after the theater was introduced, during its use and operation as a center of activity. A second major objective is to reconstruct how it might have been used during the Nabataean and Nabataean-Roman periods. In this paper I consider the problems of the use of the Great Temple from several points of view in order to ques- tion how theater-temples might have functioned. First, the contexts of this well-preserved structure, unique to Petra and the Nabataean world, are investigated within the urban fabric of Petra. Second, the temple architecture is dis- cussed. Third, the inscriptions indicate that this structure may have had official use during the Nabataean-Roman period. What do they offer the archaeological record? This structure is unique not only in Jordan but in the entire ancient Near East. The formulation of hypotheses concerning the use of the temple must account for this structure within its cultural environment. NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT OF PETRA: Zbigniew T Fiema, Dumbarton Oaks Two conflicting opinions exist concerning the urban de- velopment of Petra in Jordan. The early opinion held that Roman art and architecture had substantially influenced the monuments of Petra, and that the major development of the city should thus be dated to the Roman period (second-fourth century A.D.). More recent opinion asso- ciates most of the main public buildings as well as the basic design of the city's center with the activities during the Nab- ataean period (first century B.C.-first century A.D.). The results of the current archaeological fieldwork in Petra call for a more balanced approach: both periods appear to have witnessed considerable building activities. The Roman Street in Petra Project, conducted by the American Center of Oriental Research in 1997, has substantially sup- ported this position. The results indicate that the origins of the street area should be assigned to the Nabataean pe- riod, although the design then was on a more modest scale. The extant appearance of the site-the eastern part of the Colonnaded Street and its pavement, the monu-</page><page sequence="18">272 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 mental stairway to the Upper Market, the sidewalk, and the shops at the southern side of the street-is the result of considerable expansion dating to the Roman period. Coupled with the extant historical information concern- ing the city, it is apparent that Petra did not lose its political- economic importance after the annexation of the Naba- taean kingdom in A.D. 106, and that it continued to flour- ish afterward. THE ROMAN ODEON AT CARTHAGE: EXCAVATIONS SINCE 1994: Colin M. Wells, Trinity University The odeon, partially excavated by Gauckler in 1900- 1901, occupies three city blocks at the summit of the Odeon Hill, between decumani V and VI north and cardines IV and VII east. The site was once a Punic cemetery, and we have found several infant burials. Our excavations support Tertullian's evidence that the odeon was built ca. A.D. 200, and also Victor de Vita's accusation that the Vandals burned the building. How the drainage system of the building worked remains a puzzle, despite intensive study. Decumanus VI was first laid down at the end of the first century B.C. over the remains of a Late Punic house. A vaulted sewer was installed under the street in the late sec- ond century, and street repairs continued until the early sixth. The paving of decumanus V, however, is contempo- rary with the odeon, and the sewer is of different construc- tion. We uncovered cardo IV at its junction with decumanus V, and also found the ends of the destroyed street drains of cardo V and cardo VI running into the sewers of the decu- mani, thus proving that these cardines once existed and sug- gesting that, contrary to Gauckler's opinion, the odeon oc- cupies the site of demolished earlier constructions. Massive walls defined the perimeter, but that on the north, flanking decumanus VI and enclosing a courtyard with porticoes, was demolished, probably to reuse the stone in the Thedosian Wall of ca. 425, after which burials infiltrated the site. A THIRD-CENTURY MONUMENT TO AUGUSTUS AT CARTHAGE? Karen E. Ros, New Haven Society A fragmentary relief in the Carthage National Museum preserves most of a male head, beside which hovers a cap- ricorn. Thisjuxtaposition suggests an identification for the male figure: capricorn was the birth sign of Augustus and appeared on many Augustan coins and the Gemma Au- gustea (cf. Suet. Aug. 94). Although the arrangement of the male figure's bangs in short, comma-shaped locks does not conform precisely to any of Augustus's three main por- trait types, it is, in my opinion, similar enough to D. Bos- chung's Beziers-Spoleto Type (DI)ie Bildnisse des Augustus [ANRIW1.2, Berlin 1993] 25-26) to support the identifica- tion. Examination of portraits of Augustus on the Se- basteion at Aphrodisias demonstrates that posthumous representations of Augustus could include variations in the depiction of the hairstyle. On the Carthage relief, the method of drilling the eyes, the presence of numerous struts spanning the drill chan- nels, and the use of the drill to outline the figures all sug- gest a date in the third century A.D. A second relief frag- ment in the Carthage Museum, carved in the same style and scale, preserves a second head of Augustus, perhaps indicating the commissioning of an important monument to Rome's first emperor two centuries after his death. Sur- prisingly few representations of Augustus are definitely post-Julio-Claudian. The existence of these two late re- liefs suggests a continuing reverence for Augustus at Carthage, which may be linked to his role as (re)founder of the colony. THE 5EKERHANE K6IKfi AT SELINUS, TURKEY: TRA- JAN'S CENOTAPH: Scott Redford, Georgetown Uni- versity, and Jennifer Tobin, Arizona State University Since the early 19th century, travelers to the ruined Roman port city of Selinus in Rough Cilicia have searched for a commemorative structure connected with the death of the emperor Trajan there in A.D. 117. Attention has fo- cused on the best-preserved building, located in the middle of a colonnaded square. That building has often been dismissed as a medieval construction of reused blocks, built by the Turkish Seljuk dynasty. We agree with this as- sessment, but think that the building is more than a medi- eval hunting lodge built of spoliated masonry. Redford, in a survey of Seljuk gardens and pavilions un- dertaken in 1994-1997, was the first to make complete plans, sections, and elevations of this building, which had had only schematic plans published previously, once in 1914, and again in 1967. Careful examination of the build- ing in connection with this survey revealed that the Seljuk building encased an earlier two-chambered, barrel-vaulted masonry building different in materials and techniques from the exterior. Moreover, the masonry of this building matched that of the surrounding porticos. The architectural form of this building-within-a-build- ing is identical to the monumental tomb form most com- mon in Roman Rough Cilicia. It is our conclusion that this structure was a second-century cenotaph erected together with the forum in which it stands to commemorate Trajan, and was reclad by the Seljuks in the 13th century. VALENTINIAN'S AND VALENS'S FORTIFICATIONS AND THE SYSTEMATIC CONSTRUCTION OF FRONTIER DEFENSES: Noel Lenski, University of Colorado Archaeologists have debated for over a decade about the nature of Roman frontier defenses. While some have charged that the location of fortifications along identifi- able lines reflects a broader strategy of linear defense against external enemies, others have argued that these same structures simply follow communication routes and that they were intended to maintain internal security. The arguments and relevant literature are well summarized in the opposing papers of T. Parker and D. Graf in the pro- ceedings of the most recent Congress of Roman Frontier Studies in 1995. The debate has begun to stagnate, both because it has focused too narrowly on a single region- Palestine and Arabia-and because it has failed to focus on a sufficiently narrow time period. This paper examines the fortification efforts of one pair of co-emperors over the entire empire. Archaeological evi-</page><page sequence="19">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 273 dence from 60 forts, towers, or walls securely datable to the reigns of Valentinian and Valens (A.D. 364-375) demonstrates that systematic efforts were indeed made to strengthen frontier systems against external foes. This hy- pothesis is confirmed by 18 inscriptions-some from Pal- estine and Arabia-which show that Valentinian's and Valens's efforts were concentrated in a narrow chronologi- cal window between 367 and 371 and were implemented in a systematic fashion. Finally, abundant contemporary tex- tual evidence-Symmachus Or. 2, Them. Or. 10, De rebus bellicis, and Auson. Mos.-substantiates that the program was advertised as a planned effort to guard against exter- nal foes. BENEFICIARI IN THE SERVICE OF FINANCIAL PROCU- RATORS: Robert L. Dise, Jr, University of North- ern Iowa During the last 10 years, a group of scholars has emerged in Europe and America whose research focuses on the seconded legionaries, or beneficiarii, who served se- nior Roman officers and administrative officials during the Principate. Their work has borne ample fruit, in the form of epigraphic commentaries, historical monographs, and a growing number of articles. But it has dealt almost exclu- sively with two issues: the place of beneficiarius service within the military career system, and the details of benefi- ciarius activity in the service of the governors. This paper is concerned with an area thus far neglected: the beneficiarii serving officials of the financial administration. Analyzing the more than 1,000 beneficiarius inscriptions published through 1994, I show that during the late second and third centuries, the nature and conditions of service as a benefi- ciarius within the financial administration diverged radi- cally from those of beneficiarii serving governors, despite the fact that the men were drawn from the same military sources. While gubernatorial beneficiarii developed into administrative representatives of the governors, posted in- dependently to stationes remote from the provincial capi- tals, the beneficiarii of procurators appear almost exclu- sively at the procurators' headquarters, evidently employed as staff officers. Data are compared from the two branches of administration on beneficiarius recruitment, deploy- ment, and lengths of appointment. The results emphasize the extreme diversity that characterized beneficiarius ad- ministrative service and dramatically underscore the ab- sence of uniformity in administrative practice within the evolving bureaucracy of the late Principate. SESSION 1H: POSTER SESSION RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF MONTE CATALFARO (MINEO, SICILY): Lucia Arcifa, Univer- sit degli Studi di Palermo, Claudia Cirelli and Laura Maniscalco, Soprintendenza ai Beni Cultur- all ed Ambientali di Catania, and Brian McConnell, Emory University High in the hills along the northwest edge of the Hyblean plateau, the archaeological sites of Monte Catal- faro dominate the valley of the Margi River and mark a crossroads from central Sicily to Syracuse and from Cata- nia to Gela. Since Tomasso Fazello's early explorations in the 16th century, Monte Catalfaro (Qalat al-fahar, or field- mouse Fort, mentioned by the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi in the mid-12th century) has been known to be an impor- tant ancient center, possibly the ancient Sikel city of Trina- cia mentioned by Diodoros Siculus. Excavations in se- lected areas by the Superintendency for Cultural and Environmental Resources of Catania from 1995 to 1998 have revealed an Early Bronze Age (Castelluccian) settle- ment and a sequence of levels attributable to the Archaic and Hellenistic periods. Despite a somewhat haphazard, agglutinative arrangement, the Hellenistic constructions include impressive terrace walls, well-squared blocks, and plaster surfacing. Although no Roman Imperial compo- nent has been identified to date, the occupational se- quence includes Late Roman or Byzantine arcosolium tombs of the fifth-sixth century and the extensive remains of a Swabian castle datable roughly to the later 13th cen- tury A.D. The castle's architecture presents a rectangular plan with an added cistern and an arrow-shoot on the northern side, as well as a well-built stairway on the eastern side. The discovery in 1998 of a necropolis of individuals apparently buried according to Islamic and later Christian rites offers an added dimension to our knowledge of rural eastern Sicily in the Middle Ages. COPPER SMELTING SLAGS FROM CHRYSOKAMINO, CRETE: Philip P Betancourt and George H. Myer Temple University The copper smelting workshop at Chrysokamino is the only such installation known from the Minoan period of Crete. Its pottery covers the periods from Final Neolithic to Early Minoan III. Finds from the site include furnace fragments, pieces of bellows, and many tons of slag. An analysis program for investigation of the slags, ores, furnaces, and other material remains from the site has been initiated in order to provide information on the tech- nology in use at the installation. In this investigation, the slags provide important information on several aspects of the technology. Optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction analy- sis, and elemental analysis by proton microprobe show that a great diversity exists in the final product, indicating vari- able conditions during the long life of the workshop, and a likelihood that the installation was using more than a single ore. This latter conclusion carries an important con- sideration for persons involved in analysis of artifacts in at- tempts to determine provenance because, if true, it means the sources were already mixed before smelting occurred. It also means that the source of the ore and the location of manufacture were not necessarily identical. SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN FIFTH-CENTURY GAUL: Karen E. Carr Portland State University In 1996 I began to explore the relationship between the political transformations of the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. and rural prosperity in the catchment basins of the Rh6ne and Garonne rivers in southern France. Prelimi-</page><page sequence="20">274 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 nary results (K. Carr, in Actes du Colloque international d'his- toire. Clovis: Histoire et mimoire, Paris 1997) indicated an im- portant negative effect. A statistical study of 289 previously published sites from the Carte archdologique suggested that with the Visigothic settlement in 415, the use of money and imported goods fell off sharply in the Garonne basin, where people fled to the hills and abandoned the river- banks and roads. In the Rh6ne valley, still under Roman control, the settlement pattern remained relatively un- changed. Continued study suggested that Ostrogothic con- trol of the Rh6ne valley also had negative consequences, though less than the earlier Visigothic settlement. The ar- rival of the Franks was a disaster for the rural residents of both river valleys: the flight to the hills and to isolated areas intensified. Since 1996, further work in this area has permitted me to identify several hundred more datable sites, and the use of GIS technology and larger-scale maps has served not only to confirm these initial results, but also to suggest new avenues of inquiry. This report presents graphical informa- tion on the changing settlement patterns of fifth-century France, together with a discussion of the emerging results of this project. VULCI B: A MISSING ETRUSCAN TOMB GROUP REDISCOVERED: Richard D. De Puma, University of Iowa, and Ann Blair Brownlee, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology In 1896, the Field Museum of Natural History in Chi- cago acquired 12 Etruscan tomb groups through the ef- forts of Arthur Lincoln Frothingham, Jr. (1859-1923). Frothingham, a Princeton archaeology professor and founding editor of AJA, was acquisitions agent for several American museums (Berkeley, Philadelphia, Princeton, St. Louis, and Washington). The tombs had been excavated by Francesco Mancinelli in 1895. As was often the case, the objects were accompanied by Frothingham's cursory in- ventories and record photographs of each tomb group. Two Vulci tombs in Chicago were fully published by Rich- ard De Puma in Etruscan Tomb-Groups (Mainz 1986), but the third, Vulci B, posed problems. While the record pho- tograph shows 29 vases and some small metal objects, De Puma located only two vases from the tomb group, and there was no record that any of the other objects had ever arrived in Chicago. De Puma's efforts to locate the missing items at other museums that had employed Frothingham were unsuccessful. Recently, using De Puma's descriptions, reconstructed dimensions, and the record photograph, Ann Brownlee lo- cated the missing vases at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. It is now possible to reassemble this significant tomb group containing Etruscan bucchero, Corinthian, and Etrusco-Corinthian pottery. It is not clear why two buc- chero vases and the tomb documentation went to Chicago, while the remaining vases went to Philadelphia. Frothing- ham was usually careful to maintain the integrity of his tomb groups. The poster presentation treats the history of the group's migration and its archaeological significance, and introduces it after a century of obscurity. SINOP PROVINCE REGIONAL SURVEY 1996-1998 FIELD REPORT: Owen P Doonan, IV, University of Illinois, Chicago, AlexJ. Gantos, Tufts University, and Fredrik Hiebert, University of Pennsylvania This poster presents the results of the 1996-1998 survey in the hinterland of Sinop (ancient Sinope), Turkey. The 1998 field season continued investigations of the nearby hinterland of Sinop port and initiated a systematic under- water survey. The 1998 underwater survey focused on the area outside the south harbor of Sinop, primarily at depths of 40-100 meters, using side-scan sonar to conduct a broad-scale survey of the seafloor and to map all man- made features. In three seasons, the land survey has docu- mented approximately 150 sites, ranging from Upper Palaeolithic to Ottoman in date. During the 1998 season we investigated the middle and lower Karasu River valley 5 km west of Sinop port. Objec- tives included reconstructing the formation of the pre- modern shoreline by means of a geomorphological coring survey, establishing coastal and inland settlement patterns in all periods, and investigating the effects that the 16th- century Ottoman shipbuilding industry had on the geo- morphology of the valley and the preservation of archaeo- logical remains. The systematic archaeological survey documented settlement on the slopes overlooking the delta, using a new data collection strategy that employs dig- ital photography together with more commonly employed recording techniques. Digital photography allows us to minimize the volume of pottery collected, reducing the impact of the survey on the archaeological record. The 1998 Karasu valley survey has refined settlement models suggested by the 1996-1997 survey, clarifying the expan- sion of inland settlement during the Bronze Age and Late Roman period, and the relationship of inland settlements to the coastal economy in all periods. THE "TUSCAN" STYLE ( TSCANICAE DISPOSITIONES): VI- TRUVIUS'S THEORY AND ARCHITECTURAL PRAC- TICE: Ingrid E.M. Edlund-Berry, University of Texas at Austin One of the most difficult sections of Vitruvius's De archi- tectura is the description of the proportions of the different orders, including the Tuscan (or, more precisely, Tuscan- like) style (IV.7). Renaissance architects and modern scholars alike have grappled with the problem of applying Vitruvius's proportions to existing buildings, including Etruscan temples (G. Morolli, in Fortuna degliEtruschi 1985, 82-101). The results have often led to "strained categori- zation and arbitrary reconstructions" (A. Boethius, Etrus- can and Early Roman Architecture 1978, 37). New discoveries of Etruscan and Etrusco-Italic architec- tural remains (Acquarossa, Murlo, Poggio Colla, Rome, Rusellae, and Satricum) and an increased appreciation of the local development of Etruscan architecture (indepen- dent of Greek models) (e.g.,J.M. Turfa, BSR 64 [1996] 1- 39) provide evidence for a better understanding of the true Tuscan style. In addition to Vitruvius's analysis of the Tuscanlike elements in his own time, we can now iden-</page><page sequence="21">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 275 tify the development of Etruscan building practices, based on archaeological evidence from ca. 650 B.C. to the first century B.C. As already emphasized by L.T. Shoe in 1965 (Etruscan and Republican Roman Mouldings, MAAR 28), an essential difference between Greek and Etruscan architec- ture is the use of architectural moldings and their propor- tions. By going one step further and comparing the pro- portions of foundations and features such as column bases and capitals or revetments with the proportions of the so- called Tuscan round used in podia, column bases, altars, etc., it is now possible to identify the unmistakable and id- iosyncratic elements of the Tuscan style in ancient Italy. EXCAVATIONS AT HUMEIMA (ANCIENT HAWAR), JORDAN, 1998: Rebecca M. Foote, Harvard Univer- sity, M. Barbara Reeves, State University of New York at Buffalo, and John Peter Oleson, University of Victoria In the 1998 field season, the Humeima Excavation Project continued to work at structures already identified in fields E125 and F103 in order to illuminate activity at the Hawar/Humeima settlement in greater detail during its Roman through Islamic periods of occupation. Two sea- sons of excavation in field E125 have shed considerable light on a little-known aspect of Humeima history: the do- mestic architecture of the Roman period. E125 contains a mudbrick house with frescoed walls and stone arches. Pre- liminary analysis suggests that the house was built in the late second or early third century and destroyed suddenly in the late third century. Artifacts found within the house demonstrate the synchronous adoption of Graeco-Roman culture (in the fresco motifs), survival of indigenous cul- ture (in the pottery forms), and interaction with Egyptians (in objects originating there). The fifth season of excavation at field F103 confirmed attribution of the Islamic qasr/mosque complex as the Ab- basid family homestead and its early eighth-century date. The findings also suggest an immediate subphase of con- struction at the qasr: by the mid-eighth century the origi- nal 52 x 42 m structure expanded to its extant 61 x 50 m. Indication of later, Fatimid-Ottoman, use and subdivision of spaces continued, and an earlier, Byzantine, wall be- neath part of the qasr and mosque was clarified. Room 02 in the qasr yielded more finely carved ivory veneer panels, which were produced nonlocally and include two military figures, foreshadowing the Abbasid revolution. In addi- tion, consolidation work continued at the Roman fort and lower church. ROUGH CILICIA REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SUR- VEY, 1998 SEASON: THE URBAN ARCHITECTURE: Michael Hoff University of Nebraska, and Rhys Townsend, Clark University In 1998, the third season of the Rough Cilicia Regional Archaeological Survey, the architectural team completed the work it had begun in the previous two seasons at three of the area's major Hellenistic and Roman centers: Iotape, Antiochia ad Cragum (modern village of Gfiney), and Seli- nus (modern Gazipasa). At all these cities, important areas had never been drawn, including fortification walls, colon- naded streets, and extensive domestic areas. Although some major public buildings at these sites were surveyed in the 1960s, no attempt was made at that time to investigate either their function or date. These structures were investi- gated in 1998 in order to come to a more complete under- standing of their purpose and chronology. The architectural team also initiated the survey of two other sites, Nephelion and Kestros, neither of which had ever been studied, despite well-preserved remains that in- clude at least one temple preserved to the peak of its pedi- ment. Finally, the expedition surveyed a sampling of smaller rural sites. This evidence was combined with the results of the ground survey of the whole region in order to understand better the relationship between the major urban centers of the region and the outlying areas that supported them. The survey also lay the foundation for fu- ture excavation at one of the urban sites. LH III METAL HANDLES FROM THE NORTH SLOPE OF THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS: Susan C. Jones, Bryn Mawr College Among the more than 300 copper-alloy artifacts found during the American School of Classical Studies' early ex- cavations on the north slope of the Athenian Acropolis was a small group of LH III vessel handles. These seven han- dles vary in size and in the level of the technical skill that they exhibit, but they are typical of the wishbone and knobbed handles on Mycenaean trays, cups, and lekanai. Such vessels were found in the nearby Agora, at other sites on the Greek mainland, and at contemporary sites around the Mediterranean, including Mycenae, Asine, Dendra, Phaistos, Sellopoulo, and Enkomi. In general, vessels with such handles were manufactured in a variety of media-in precious metals, copper alloys, and even clay-and deco- rated in a variety of styles from simple undecorated sur- faces to delicately inlaid designs. Mycenaean handles from the north slope come from settlement contexts, while those found in the Agora are from burial deposits. Com- parisons of the archaeological contexts of the north slope with others in which similar vessels were found shed light on the general functions of these vessels within Mycenaean society. Comparisons also clarify Late Bronze Age activity on the northern side of the Athenian Acropolis and rela- tionships between the Acropolis and the cemetery below. USES OF THE EPIGRAPHICAL RECORD IN THE GEO- LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF HARBOR AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AT EPHESOS AND THE ARTEMISION: John C. Kraft, University of Delaware, and Helmut Engelmann, Cologne University A more precise understanding of ancient geographies of the harbors of Ephesos and the Artemision is attained by a careful integration of clues from the written record with sedimentological facies studies. We use 14 comments</page><page sequence="22">276 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 from antiquity to improve upon the coastal environmental delineations now underway by our team of geologists and physical geographers under the auspices of the Oster- reichisches Archdiologisches Institut and the Efes Mfizesi. For instance, Archestratus of Gela, in the Early Hellenistic period, speaks of the (fat) fish in the brackish Selinus River near the Artemision. Sedimentological studies show a low- lying prograding deltaic shoreline near the Artemision at that time. Thus, the estuarine mouth of the Selinus River was probably nearby. Livy comments in 190 B.C. on the mouth of the great harbor of Ephesos during a siege by the Roman, Pergamene, and Rhodian fleet: "the mouth of the harbor was like a river: long, narrow and full of shoals." Similarly, Strabo, writing in the time of Tiberius, notes a destructive harbor engineering "improvement" by Attalus II Philadelphus, who built a mole to narrow the harbor mouth in order to prevent siltation, while in fact creating a sediment trap that further diminished the usefulness of the harbor (perhaps the most frequently quoted negative environmental impact action by peoples in antiquity). Hadrian undertook a diversion of the Cayster River (Man- thites River?) to prevent further damage (sedimentation) "in the harbors of the city." These and many other refer- ences to harbor dredging, infill, expansion, and reloca- tion throughout the long history of Ephesos tell us much about coastal and harbor evolution at the site over one and a half millennia. IN THE SHADOW OF HADRIAN: Two ROMAN AQUE- DUCT BRIDGES IN ATTICA: Shawna Leigh, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania The remains of two aqueduct bridges are located in Nea Ionia, a northeastern suburb of Athens. Two late 19th- century A.D. general works on Athenian water supply and the Karten von Attika, dating to 1879, are the earliest cer- tain records of the existence of the monuments. The struc- tures were never excavated, and thus there is no associated material that may be used for dating evidence. Still, in the brief discussions that do exist of the piers, they are gener- ally assumed to be contemporary with one another, and part of the water supply system constructed for Athens, which was completed in A.D. 140. There is no detailed work on Athenian water supply during the Roman period, and these structures have never been studied properly. In this poster presentation I demonstrate that, given the rela- tive elevations above sea level of the two aqueduct bridges and the main tunnel of the second-century A.D. aqueduct, it is hydraulically unlikely for these two bridges to belong to the Hadrianic system, either as a part of the original construction or as a later addition. Alternatively, I argue that the building techniques used in the structures suggest that they were part of a well-attested fifth-century A.D. im- provement of the water supply system of Athens. WHAT IS THE SINO-AMERICAN FIELD SCHOOL OF ARCHAEOLOGY? Alfonz Lengyel, Fudan Museum Foundation In 1990, the Fudan Museum Foundation, in collabora- tion with Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Archaeological Research Institute of the Shaanxi Province, Xi'an, estab- lished the Sino-American Field School of Archaeology. The school is accredited by the Education Commission of Shaanxi Province and the Society for Professional Archae- ologists (SOPA), and has provided the first opportunity for foreign archaeologists to work in China since 1906. At present, other foreign groups are also working in the field. Although there are a great number of foreign specialists on Chinese art, none of them had previously excavated in China. Through the field school, participants can now es- tablish contacts with leading archaeologists in China, pav- ing the way for future collaboration. The program is an ar- chaeological practicum and accepts a limited number of interested adults. With the exception of a few large-scale excavations, emphasis in China is on salvage archaeology, which suits well the purposes of this field school. IT DOES TAKE A BRAIN SURGEON: A SUCCESSFUL TREPANATION FROM KAVOUSI: Maria A. Liston, University of Waterloo Trepanation, the surgical removal of a portion of the skull, is known from skeletal evidence at archaeological sites around the world. In this procedure a hole is made in the skull by drilling, cutting, or scraping through the bone. These techniques were developed long before the appear- ance of sterile surgical techniques, anesthesia, and anti- biotic therapy, and as a result, most patients quickly suc- cumbed to the surgery or subsequent infection. Literary and palaeopathological evidence suggests that trepanation was indicated for traumatic injuries to the skull, and for other conditions such as headache or mental disorders. In Greece, a number of ancient perimortem trepanations are known from Bronze Age archaeological sites on the main- land. None of the patients survived for long after the sur- gery. There is also evidence for postmortem drilling of skulls. Trepanation is later attested in Hippocrates' Epidem- ics as treatment for head wounds, but not for cranial frac- tures. At Kavousi, Crete, a Dark Age cremation burial has produced evidence of a large trepanation on the side of the skull of an adult male. The beveled edges and the oval shape of the incision indicate that the scraping technique was used. There are no fractures or other indications of why the surgery was performed. There is no evidence of in- fection and the wound appears to have been completely healed at the time of death, indicating long-term survival after surgery. This is the first definite evidence of trepana- tion from prehistoric Crete, and of long-term survival fol- lowing cranial surgery in Greece. THE 1998 EXCAVATIONS AT ABILA OF THE DECAP- OLIs: W Harold Mare, Covenant Theological Seminary The 1998 season of excavation at Abila of the Decapolis, northern Jordan, took place between June 13 and August 1, under the direction of W. Harold Mare. We continued our investigation in several different areas. On the north tell, Tell Abila, we expanded our excavation around the pe- rimeter of the sixth-century basilica, seeking to find fur- ther remains of the life-size marble statue of Artemis dis-</page><page sequence="23">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 277 covered in 1994. We also expanded the nearby deep trench with its extensive Iron and Bronze Age materials. On the south tell, Umm el Amad, we further excavated the area of auxiliary buildings just south of the seventh- century basilica and expanded excavation in the earlier ba- silica just to the west, probing its north wall complexes. In the central civic center between the two tells, search was made for additional remains of the theater, including re- mains of the large Zeus statue, which stood in the central niche on the theater's back wall. Besides excavating addi- tional Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine tombs along the ledges of Wadi Quailibah, we continued our search for the Iron Age and Bronze Age cemetery. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IN ETRUSCO-ITALIC ARCHI- TECTURE: AN ACCESS ANALYSIS: Gretchen Ellen Meyers, University of Texas at Austin In recent years, classical archaeologists and social histo- rians have begun to apply spatial architectural theory to ancient structures to understand the relationship between architectural boundaries and social functions performed within them (A. Wallace-Hadrill, Houses and Society in Pompeii and Herculaneum, Princeton 1994, and R. Laurence, Roman Pompeii: Space and Society, New York 1994). In access analysis (B. Hillier and J. Hanson, The Social Logic of Space, Cambridge 1984), an "access map" of a building is created, indicating all transitional areas (i.e., passageways). Analysis of this plan determines each room's potential for social in- teraction, both on a public level between the structure's inhabitants and guests, and on a more restricted private level among the inhabitants. Thus, one gains a better un- derstanding of movement within the structure, as well as the relationship among its patrons. While scholars have already directed such efforts toward Roman architecture, it is also possible to utilize access anal- ysis for the study of three Etrusco-Italic building com- plexes, the Upper Building at Poggio Civitate, Area F at Ac- quarossa, and Building A at Satricum. These complexes, characterized by inner courtyards and substantial room differentiation, are not well understood and are often in- terpreted using intuition. Access analysis, as an impartial methodology, reveals great accessibility of movement be- tween the architecturally defined areas within these com- plexes. This arrangement facilitates a maximum of social interaction between both regular and invited patrons and indicates a public aspect to the function of each building. ROMAN AND LATE ANTIQUE COARSE WARES FROM SOUTHERN EPIRUS, GREECE: Melissa G. Moore, Boston University Utilitarian ceramics dating from the late third century B.C. to the sixth century A.D. are used to consider the so- cial impact of the Roman presence in southwestern Epirus, Greece. New regional sequences have been developed for Late Hellenistic, Roman, and Late Antique Epirote ceram- ics, with special attention given to those vessels connected with the distribution, preparation, and service of food. These new typologies, based on studies of excavated ce- ramic deposits and material collected by the Nikopolis Project regional survey, are the product of the first system- atic study of Roman and Late Antique ceramics in south- ern Epirus. The creation of new regional sequences for this body of ceramic material has made it possible to document broad regional patterns of ceramic production and exchange in southern Epirus. Developments in the production technol- ogy and functional morphology of locally produced am- phoras and cookware are considered, as are the changing ratios of local products to imported wares. It is argued that changes in the production and importation of three pri- mary ceramic classes, all related to food preparation and consumption, reflect deeper shifts in the social organiza- tion of southern Epirus during the Roman and Late An- tique periods. Graphs, line drawings, and photographs are used to illustrate these points. THE IDALION SURVEY PROJECT, CYPRUS, 1995- 1998: Margaret E. Morden, University of Michi- gan, and Sarah T Stewart, Toronto Society The Idalion Survey Project is an interdisciplinary inves- tigation of the hinterland of ancient Idalion, one of the more important kingdoms of Iron Age Cyprus. The project seeks to place ancient Idalion within its archaeological, his- torical, and environmental frameworks, with special atten- tion being paid to the chert and clay resources used by the communities situated in this ancient and evolving landscape. While our initial, preliminary survey conducted in 1995 was strictly judgmental in nature, our overall goal for the 1998 season was the documentation of all past human ac- tivity in our study area. To obtain such a predictive model of the past from the present archaeological landscape, a probabilistic sampling strategy rather than a judgmental selection of the survey areas must be employed. Through sampling the present pattern of archaeological finds in this manner, it is then possible to predict to what extent these finds are an accurate reflection of the past use of the area. One method of testing the validity of the archaeolog- ical sample, especially when it is limited in size, is through selective resampling. If the survey sample is rigorous enough, similar results should be obtained through resur- vey. This has proved to be the case at Idalion. The report includes findings from specialists studying the pottery, terracottas and sculpture, lithics, chert and clay resource areas, and soil horizons, as well as ethno- graphic studies of the modern pottery and the historic Dhoukani industries. POSEIDON'S HORSES: RECONSIDERATION OF EARTH- QUAKES AND "SYSTEMS COLLAPSE" AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE IN THE AEGEAN AND EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN: Amos Nur and Eric H. Cline, Stanford University In light of the accumulated evidence now published in, for example, Stiros and Jones's Archaeoseismology (Athens 1996), the often denigrated suggestion that major earth- quakes took place in the Aegean area during the late 13th and early 12th centuries B.C. must be reconsidered. A new</page><page sequence="24">278 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 study of earthquakes occurring in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean region during the 20th century A.D., utiliz- ing data recorded since the invention of seismic tracking devices, shows that this area is crisscrossed with major fault lines and that numerous temblors of magnitude 6.5 (enough to destroy modern buildings, let alone those of antiquity) occur frequently. It can be demonstrated that such major earthquakes often occur in groups or so- called "storms," in which one large quake is followed days, months, or even years later by others elsewhere on the now-weakened fault line. When a map of the areas affected (i.e., shaken) by earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 and greater during this cen- tury in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean region is overlaid on Robert Drew's map of sites destroyed in these same regions during the so-called "Catastrophe" near the end of the Late Bronze Age, it is readily apparent that vir- tually all of these LBA sites lie within the affected ("high- shaking") areas. While the evidence is by no means con- clusive, we would like to introduce these new data into the debate and to resurrect tentatively the hypothesis that earthquakes may, in fact, have played a major role in the "systems collapse" that led to the end of the LBA Aegean and eastern Mediterranean worlds. EXCAVATION AND SURVEY AT HACIMUJSALAR (CHO- MA) IN LYCIA: Ilknur Ozgen, Jean Oztiirk, and Deniz Kaptan, Bilkent University, Mark Garrison, Trinity University, and Pedar Foss, University of Cincinnati Finds from the site of Hacimfisalar in Lycia indicate a pe- riod of occupation extending back as far as the Neolithic. Besides its importance as a multiperiod site, the mound is the largest in the Elmah plain (300 X 350 m and 13 m in height). Four seasons of excavation have revealed evi- dence, primarily of Late Roman date, of fortification sys- tems, a cemetery area, industrial activity, and structures representing at least four major building phases. The in- vestigations conducted so far provide a solid framework for future excavation. A regional survey of the Elmali plain complements the work on the site itself, with the aim of es- tablishing a pattern of intersettlement relations, ancient communication systems, and land use from the prehistoric period onward. This poster presentation, besides presenting the data al- ready obtained from both excavation and survey, intro- duces the site as an ideal model for establishing a regional material culture sequence, particularly a definitive ce- ramic sequence, and includes results of the 1998 season during which extensive use was made of electronic re- cording systems. EXCAVATIONS AT KOURION'S AMATHUS GATE CEM- ETERY, 1998: Danielle A. Parks, University of Missouri-Columbia The 1998 excavation season of the Kourion Amathus Gate Cemetery, sponsored by the Cyprus American Ar- chaeological Research Institute (CAARI), was the fourth undertaken by this project. The cemetery presents a rare opportunity to study the evolution of a Roman necropolis from the first century to the fifth, spanning the transition from paganism to Christianity. This phase of the project has several aims. Efforts con- tinue to emphasize the Late Roman segment currently under intensive excavation in order to clarify the funerary customs of this poorly understood period. The presence of rich burial assemblages indicates that the cist tomb type housed the wealthy as well as the poorer classes, contrary to previous supposition. Investigation of the area immedi- ately outside the city gate and to the northwest of the first region has begun. The 1997 survey located the original ac- cess roads to the settlement and the cemetery. It now re- mains to test this area in an attempt to locate the city gate and to examine the tombs in this area to see if they are of higher status than those further from the city gate. Efforts continue to focus on how the Kourion cemetery interacted with its settlement and the adjacent landscape, and how these relationships evolved over time. The analysis of the human remains will establish the number of occupants of these tombs, their age and sex, and equally important, will provide a complete picture of the general health and occupational stresses enjoyed by the inhabitants of Late Roman Kourion. ROUGH CILICIA REGIONAL SURVEY PROJECT: REPORT OF THE 1998 SEASON: Nicholas K. Rauh, Purdue University, Rhys Townsend, Clark Univer- sity, Michael Hoff University of Nebraska, Rich- ard Rothaus, St. Cloud State University, Kathleen Slane, University of Missouri-Columbia, Stephen Tracy, Ohio State University, and Mette Korsholm, Danish Institute in Athens Our investigation entails a systematic surface survey of a 60-km coastal strip of western Rough Cilicia, from Corace- sium (Alanya) to Antiochia ad Cragum (inclusive). The project is contributing new data and ideas to social theo- ries that address the consequences of interaction at the scales of world system, area, and region. The study region, while environmentally marginal and never the site of a major polity, was well situated in a way other marginal re- gions were not to seaborne commercial flows along the boundaries of important polities, and between major Med- iterranean sea routes and the inland populations of Anato- lia. Rough Cilicia proved an ideal setting for the develop- ment of semiperiphery and boundary polities, a process most clearly expressed in the growth of the powerful Cili- cian pirate societies of the Late Hellenistic period (139-67 B.C.). Through a systematic surface survey, we are locat- ing, describing, and analyzing all sites within the survey re- gion to reconstruct patterns of long-term social change and to contextualize the pirate social system within the sys- tems that preceded and followed it. Preliminarily, our data indicate that the period of greatest change for the region was not the pirate era but that which immediately followed (first-second centuries A.D.). We summarize these data- ceramic, architectural, land-use, and epigraphical-in our</page><page sequence="25">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 279 report. The project's larger goals are to expand awareness of the nature of social change in an influential semiperiph- ery, and to contribute to the growing comparative study of semiperipheral actors in the transformation of world sys- tems generally. ELITE CACHES AND CACHING PRACTICES IN THE MAYA LOWLANDS: Yasha N. Rodriguez, Finger Lakes Society This poster presentation deals with an investigation of elite caches and caching practices in the Maya lowlands during the Classic period (A.D. 200-900). A total of 505 elite caches are examined. The caches compiled for this study come from seven Maya sites: Altun Ha, Chalchuapa, Copan, Piedras Negras, Quirigua, Tikal, and Uaxactun. A series of quantitative tests were performed to detect possible patterns in caching practices of elites during the Classic period. Similarities and differences between cache contents, assemblages, and locations were explored. Two theoretical models, those of Mary W. Helms (1993) and Colin Renfrew (1986), are brought together in an effort to understand elite caching behavior. The analysis and evaluation of the data reveal the com- plexities of elite caching practices. Conscious choice of cache assemblages, such as pairing of specific items, and of the degree of elaboration of the cache, for example, by num- ber of types of items, is documented. Overarching aspects of caching (shared by all sites), site-specific variations, and sharing of caching practices between specific groups of sites are detected. The similarities and differences of elite caching behavior are explained in terms of the relations and associations among elites at particular sites, which in some cases are neighbors and in other cases are at a con- siderable distance from one another. Overall, I hope to contribute to the understanding of caches and elite cach- ing practices in the Maya lowlands. POT BELLOWS FROM CHRYSOKAMINO: A THEO- RETICAL RECONSTRUCTION: Alexandra Smith, Temple University Several challenges faced ancient peoples as they began processing metal ores. Of specific interest here is the tech- nique utilized in achieving temperatures high enough to smelt the ores. Due to the biodegradable nature of a por- tion of the pot bellows' materials, archaeologists are left only with pot fragments and do not have a clear under- standing of how the device worked as a component of an- cient metallurgical processes. This poster focuses on the pot bellow remains recently uncovered at Chrysokamino, Crete. The Chrysokamino find is significant because re- searchers date these fragments to the Early Minoan III pe- riod, placing them earlier than any other bellows discov- ered in the Mediterranean. To develop more fully the design and operation of the Chrysokamino pot bellows, I examine evidence of several bellow types from other Medi- terranean civilizations. Also, information gathered from a full-scale reproduction and experimental operation of a pair of Chrysokamino pot bellows helps to focus the theory of design by eliminating or reinforcing specific details. THE CYPRO-MINOAN CORPUS PROJECT: FIRST PRE- LIMINARY REPORT: Joanna S. Smith, Cyprus Amer- ican Archaeological Research Institute, and Nicolle E. Hirschfeld, University of Texas at Austin Approximately 250 objects bear inscriptions in the un- deciphered script called Cypro-Minoan, a linear script used on Cyprus and in Syria between 1550 and 1050 B.C. These inscriptions appear on a range of objects such as clay tablets, votive stands, jewelry, loom weights, and vases. Several are short in length (1-10 signs), though there also exist longer documents (up to 400+ signs). It is difficult to determine whether the signs conform to a single writing system or, indeed, language because of the wide geograph- ical, chronological, and contextual differences among the inscribed objects. Cypro-Minoan's unusual variety of use, however, allows us to study it through time and space over six centuries. Both the context (archaeology) and content (epigraphy) of the inscriptions are important. Archaeological details of their contexts can indicate details of their functions even without understanding their contents. Epigraphical details indicate how the script was written, as well as what it con- veys and by whom. At this time Cypro-Minoan inscriptions are inadequately published and scattered in museums in the Mediterra- nean, Middle East, Europe, and the United States. The goal of the Cypro-Minoan Corpus Project (CyMCoP) is to restudy thoroughly and widely publish the script in The Corpus of Cypro-Minoan Inscriptions (CCMI) (printed volume and electronic format). In this poster session we present the results of our work to date, including new drawings and interpretations of inscriptions from Enkomi and Kalavasos- Ayios Dhimitrios as well as the CyMCoP database. IVORY AND BONE FURNITURE VENEERS IN LATE ROMAN EGYPT: Wilma Stern, Pennsylvania State University Among the fragmentary furniture excavated in 1965 at Kenchreai, the Saronic Gulf port of ancient Corinth, are ivory- and bone-veneered elements that demonstrate the use of a technique of softening and shaping these normally hard materials. At least three ivory-veneered framing mem- bers consist of a flat, rectangular panel pegged along its length into either a half-round or flattened oval rod. The ivory covering one rod is 47 cm long. Strips were cut from the tusk longitudinally as is evident from the elongated parabolic rings visible on the surface. The ivory was prob- ably partially demineralized and, while softened, formed into a curved shape that was glued directly to the wooden core where it finished drying and rehardened. In other ex- amples, narrow strips of ivory and bone veneer were shaped to fit against the boldly curved inner and outer sur- faces of both cabriole and curule chair legs and the edges of struts. The Kenchreai furniture demonstrates that at</page><page sequence="26">280 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 least in Egypt, where the furniture was produced, ivory and bone veneer shaping was routinely practiced in the fourth century. Larger flat surfaces were covered with rows of strips, indicating that no technique of producing expanded sheets of veneer, as would be developed in the 19th century, was in use. The reciprocating motion of ancient lathes probably precluded the development of the necessary spiral-slicing technique. The Kenchreai furniture dramati- cally expands the known examples of ancient ivory shaping enumerated by K. Lapatin (AJA 101 [1997] 663-82). PLAIN-FACED CAPITALS ON CYPRUS: Pippa Vander- star, St. George's School A corpus of 26 Plain-faced capitals on Cyprus sheds light on the origins and uses of this capital in the Mediterra- nean during Roman times. The Plain-faced capital is a blocked-out version of a Corinthian capital and occurs on Cyprus during the first three centuries A.D. This capital has been called a Nabataean capital, but the term cannot be applied to those capitals found outside Nabataea and a more universal term is sought. I distinguish two types of Plain-faced capitals on Cyprus, each relating to a different form of the Heterodox Corinthian capital found there. Plain-faced capitals are capitals in their own right and not merely unfinished Corinthian capitals. This is clear from their high degree of finish, intricate detailing, and the fact that fully finished entablatures and bases occur with them. On Cyprus, the Plain-faced capital supplants the Corin- thian capital and is employed on the Roman temples of Aphrodite at Amathus and Apollo at Kourion. Plain-faced capitals found outside the island are reinter- preted in light of the evidence from Cyprus. One of the two types of Cypriot Plain-faced capitals has a comparable structure to Plain-faced capitals from Petra and Bosra in ancient Nabataea, Marina el Alemain in Egypt, and Ma- sada in Israel. They are modeled on similar versions of the Heterodox Corinthian capital popular at these sites and are not necessarily evidence of communication. In this poster presentation, I reevaluate the method of manufac- ture of Plain-faced capitals, their usage, and possible rea- sons for the increased popularity of the form. SURVEY OF CLASSICAL HARBORS IN TURKEY: 1998 SEASON AT APERLAE IN LYCIA: Robert L. Vann, Tony Belanger and Steven C. Boyle, University of Mary- land, Robert L. Hohlfelder and Mary Wilard, Univer- sity of Colorado, Davis Alvey, University of Vic- toria, and fames Bucko, James Mason University The summer of 1998 marked the sixth season of the University of Maryland Survey of Ancient Harbors in Tur- key and the third year in partnership with the University of Colorado. Previous reports were presented in 1992 on the original survey of Cilicia, in 1994 on the survey at Pompeiopolis, in 1995 on the survey at Korykos, and in 1996 and 1997 on the first two seasons at Aperlae in Lycia. The 1998 survey of Aperlae continued the work of the first season. Vann directed the survey of structures on land. The for- tifications survey was extended to include several watch- towers of remarkably similar plans from the environs of the city. The detailed study of the Upper Church and a prelim- inary study of the Lower Church by Mary Wiland of the University of Colorado and Eduardo Lyon of the Univer- sidad de Chile also took place, and a survey of the sarcoph- agi located in the two major necropoli as well as others scattered through the countryside continued. Hohlfelder continued work on the submerged church as well as some of the minor structures that may have been associated with the purple dye industry. Ayse Atauz of the Bodrum Museum recorded this year's ceramics and Jason Prescott of the University of Colorado continued the inves- tigation of the murex middens. EXCAVATIONS AT THE ETRUSCAN SITE OF POGGIO COLLA (1997-1998): P Gregory Warden, South- ern Methodist University, Michael Thomas, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin, and Karen Vellucci, University of Pennsylvania Since 1995, excavations at the Etruscan site of Poggio Colla, 22 miles northeast of Florence, have revealed an acropolis area whose main feature is an Archaic Tuscan temple. Parts of this temple (monumental molded blocks as well as three large sandstone column bases) were reused in the later, Classical and Hellenistic, phases of the site. This reuse has made reconstruction of the Archaic struc- ture(s) difficult, but new evidence has been provided by the discovery of the temple foundations, disposed in a north-south direction. The Archaic phase was prosperous; finds include decorated bucchero, figured bronzes, and imported Greek pottery. The 1998 campaign has also pro- duced new information about the acropolis in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Two buildings of these later phases were excavated in 1998. Also new is the excavation of an area on the lower terraces of the site, almost a kilo- meter from the acropolis. Here there is evidence of a vio- lent destruction of what may be structures of Hellenistic date. Excavation at Poggio Colla has also been augmented by remote sensing, an archaeo-topographic survey of the region, materials analysis, and palaeobotanical studies. This varied evidence from a site that spans most of Etrus- can history, from the seventh through the third centuries B.C., offers a rare view of the growth and development of a prosperous Etruscan settlement. A DIACHRONIC STUDY OF THE EXPLOITATION OF CERAMIC RAW MATERIALS IN THE BERBATI VAL- LEY, ARGOLID: Ian K. Whitbread and Matthew J Ponting, Fitch Laboratory, British School at Ath- ens, and Berit Wells, Swedish Institute in Athens This investigation of diversity and temporal continuity in the exploitation of ceramic raw materials arises out of increasing evidence for local production in the Berbati val- ley from the Late Bronze Age onward. Over 200 samples of ceramics, from Neolithic to modern, were taken for petro- graphic and elemental (ICP-AES) analysis. These samples</page><page sequence="27">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 281 came from material collected in the 1988-1990 Berbati- Limnes Survey, with supplementary material from excava- tions in the valley. Prospection for potential raw materials was undertaken, including both clays and rocks. Much of the central and eastern area of the valley is composed of alluvial fans that, apart from very rare lenses, have not retained their clay fraction. Raw material resources are therefore restricted. As a result, prospection for clays has concentrated on the western end of the valley. A number of good sources have been located and compared with ancient ceramics through elemental and petrographic composition. The range of ceramic fabrics mainly reflects local geol- ogy, i.e., limestone, flysch, marls, and alluvial sediments. A few imported volcanic fabrics occur in Neolithic and Early Helladic ceramics. Detecting ceramic imports that have compositions consistent with local geology is extremely dif- ficult. Fabric groups based on broad geological character- istics are particularly unreliable in this respect. This project has therefore focused on more subtle differences in fabric structure and clay-dependent properties for dis- criminating between fabric classes in terms of chronology and vessel form, and in seeking correlation with potential clay sources. SESSION 2A: COLLOQUIUM: RECENT DE- VELOPMENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SRI LANKA THE "BAMBOO CURTAIN HYPOTHESIS" IN SRI LAN- KAN PREHISTORY AND PALAEOBIOLOGY: Ken- neth A.R. Kennedy, Cornell University The diminution of the Indian subcontinent's Acheulian technological tradition along the northeastern border- lands of Assam and Burma during the Middle Pleistocene is ascribed by some prehistorians to the replacement of stone for manufacturing bifacial hand axes and cleavers by bamboo and other organic raw materials. A parallel cul- tural development of a "Bamboo Curtain" is hypothesized for the Palaeolithic inhabitants of southern India, where Acheulian tools decrease in frequency south of the Kaveri (Cauvery) River in Tamil Nadu and are absent in Sri Lanka. The present study assesses the evidence for this the- ory in the context of the relative cultural and biological isolation of the Pleistocene inhabitants of Sri Lanka. Skele- tal remains of anatomically modern Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene cave sites of Fa Hien (ca. 34,000 B.P.), Bat- adomba Lena (ca. 16,500 B.P.), and Beli Lena Kitulgala (ca. 12,500 B.P.) reveal morphometric variations unique to the island's prehistoric populations, palaeobiological data that complement the archaeological evidence of cultural separateness from the Indian mainland and islands of the Indian Ocean domain. Microlithic tools of a Mesolithic technological tradition continued from Late Pleistocene times until the dawn of the Iron Age in Sri Lanka, but there is no archaeological record to demonstrate that Palaeolithic (Acheulian), Neolithic, and Chalcolithic tech- nologies and lifeways were present on the island. It is con- cluded that the thesis of a "Kaveri Bamboo Curtain" once present in southern India contributes significantly toward a more accurate reconstruction of the palaeoecological and palaeobiological factors accounting for Sri Lanka's ap- parent cultural and genetic isolation from adjacent land- masses and islands from the Middle Pleistocene to the Middle Holocene period. "LOOKING FOR LINEAGE ANCESTORS": THE ARCHAE- OLOGY OF EARLY IRON AGE MEGALITHIC BURIALS IN SRI LANKA: Sudharshan Seneviratne, University of Peradeniya The Early Iron Age (EIA) Megalithic Black and Red Ware (BRW) culture was the formative techno-cultural ma- trix that ushered in the "beginnings of civilization" to southern India and Sri Lanka. Nearly 50 habitation or burial sites of the EIA have been identified in diverse bio- climatic and resource zones on the island. At the end of the second millennium B.C., the EIA culture introduced the use of metals, wheelmade pottery, bead production, plant and animal domestication, village settlements, rudi- mentary water management, and megalithic burial ritual to Sri Lanka. In 1997, the Government Department of Archaeology and the Department of Archaeology, University of Pera- deniya, began a collaborative venture at the three-ha mega- lithic site of Pinwewa with a focus on investigative research and training in palaeoenvironmental archaeological meth- ods and techniques, proto- and early historic archaeology, and ethnoarchaeology. Excavations revealed cist and urn burials containing grave deposits of BRW and plain ware; calcined bones; iron, copper, and gold objects; and beads of agate, carnelian, and glass. A total of 42 "lineage" sym- bols engraved on the capstones of the graves have been identified and recorded. Analytical studies and documen- tary work on the materials from these graves are currently being carried out in the university laboratories. The project also included a program targeted toward visiting school children that employed on-site lectures and a mobile poster exhibition on heritage management and the palaeoenvironment of Sri Lanka. THE STUPA: ITS SYMBOLISM AND A NEED TO RE- THINK POLICY, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SRI LANKA: Ashley de Vos, ADV Consultants Over the years, the stupa, or dagoba, evolved from a simple burial mound to an object of great importance and veneration in the Buddhist community. The role of Sri Lanka at the center of the trade route between Rome and China further enhanced its evolution. A detailed study carried out on the 400-ft-high Jetavana stupa, which at the time of its construction in handmade bricks in the third century was the third tallest structure in the ancient world, shows that the Stapathis understood the symbolism and effect of structural stresses and movements and allowed for them in their designs. This presentation encompasses the large stupas of Anuradhapura (3 B.C.- A.D. 3, Ruwanwelisaya, the Abeyagirisaya, and the Jeteva- naramaya) and the special stupas, the "Vatadages," the</page><page sequence="28">282 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 Thuparamaya, Medirigiriya, Thiriyaya, and Vatadage in Polonnaruwa. Over time, the kings of Sri Lanka maintained, restored, and added to the stupas. The chronicles confirm that slaves were never used. The work was carried out by the public with veneration. The basic concept of the stupa and its execution are steeped in symbolism. The current resto- ration and conservation policy, which includes excavation, requires radical review. MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES OF SRI LANKAN MURAL PAINTINGS OF THE LATE HISTORICAL PERIOD (A.D. 1750-1900): B.D. Nandadeva, University of Kelaniya The tradition of artistic representations in the form of cave paintings dates to the historic period in Sri Lanka. While the early literary texts record the existence of mural and fresco paintings during the historical period, the earli- est surviving evidence is found at Sigiriya (fourth century A.D.). This tradition was nourished through both Indian (e.g., Ajanta and Ellora) and Southeast Asian schools of art. The evolution of the mural painting tradition, both in its content and technique, can be seen at Polonnaruwa (11th century A.D.), Dambulla, and Kandy (post-14th cen- tury A.D.). This paper outlines scientific analyses of the materials and technology employed in historic-period paintings by artists of various stylistic schools. Samples of supports, primers, and paint layers from mural paintings were analyzed from six randomly selected sites using optical microscopy, micro-chemical methods, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, X- ray spectrometry by dispersive microanalysis, Fourier trans- form infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography, and pyrolisis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Microscopic examination of samples shows that the paintings were done in the tempera technique, frequently on a clay and sand ground covered with a thin priming layer. Investigation revealed huntite, clay, lithopone, lime, barite, lead white, and gypsum in the priming layer. Analyt- ical data confirm that vermilion, orpiment, gamboge, Prus- sian blue, and soot have been used as pigments. Binding media analyses suggest the presence of gums, oils, resins, and proteins. SESSION 2B: COLLOQUIUM: MEDITERRA- NEAN CIVILIZATIONS AND THEIR EURO- PEAN NEIGHBORS: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON INTERACTIONS "MINISTERS OF MEAD AND WINE": THE MEDITER- RANEAN WINE TRADE AND THE INSTITUTIONAL- IZATION OF IRON AGE ELITES: Bettina Arnold, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee The role of alcoholic beverages in establishing and maintaining social hierarchies at least as early as the Bronze Age in Western Europe is well attested. Several al- coholic beverages are documented in the archaeological record as well as the Mediterranean texts from the sixth century B.C. on: beer, made without hops or preservatives; mead, made from the honey of wild bees, requiring an ex- tremely long fermentation period and with a relatively short shelf life; and wine, imported from the Mediterra- nean world, which contained enough resin to allow it to be stockpiled for relatively longer periods of time than beer or mead. Regular access to wine seems to have been re- stricted to elite individuals whose graves contained not only Mediterranean imports but also other locally pro- duced high-status items. A diachronic study of grave good assemblages from sev- eral elite burials from west central Europe (Late Bronze Age through the Late La T&amp;ne period) suggests that feast- ing, particularly the distribution of alcoholic beverages, ac- quired increased sociopolitical significance through time partly as a result of the superior storage qualities of Medi- terranean wine and the relative scarcity of the imported drinking vessels. This would have allowed elites to time their feasts strategically, resulting in a concomitant in- crease in political influence. The social complexity re- flected in burial and settlement data beginning in the Early Iron Age reflects the changing influence of the "min- isters of mead and wine" who controlled and monopolized the movement of alcoholic beverages and drinking equip- ment through their societies. GALATIAN GORDION: Mary M. Voigt, College of William and Mary Documentary sources attest to the migration of Galatian mercenaries into Anatolia in 278 B.C., and these merce- naries presumably moved into central Anatolia soon there- after. A Galatian settlement at Gordion was described by Livy in his account of the campaign of Manlius Vulso in 189 B.C. Vulso found the settlement abandoned, its inhab- itants having fled to a mountain fortress. This historical event has been linked to archaeological remains at Yassi- hoyuk/Gordion that were assumed to represent a single occupation phase dated to the third/second century B.C.; this phase is characterized by buildings that were filled with domestic equipment, i.e., "abandoned." Recent excavation has significantly increased our un- derstanding of Galatian Gordion (phase 3A in the Yassi- hoyuk stratigraphic sequence, or YHSS). Three YHSS 3A architectural phases have now been defined and dated by Attic imports. The initial phase dates to the second quarter of the third century, and ends with an "abandonment" as does the second architectural phase, which probably rep- resents the settlement visited by Vulso; the third architec- tural phase apparently dates to the mid-second century. Newly excavated buildings on Yassihoyuk include a figurine- maker's workshop, a large structure built of ashlar blocks, and an ashlar wall ca. 2 m thick that sets off these build- ings from the rest of the settlement. This complex may account for Livy's characterization of Galatian Gordion as an "oppidum" or fortified place. Evidence for ritual practices comes from the Galatian cemetery at Gordion, where deposits of human and animal bone document</page><page sequence="29">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 283 human sacrifice, a continuation in Anatolia of practices found in Celtic Europe. TRANSFORMATIONS IN IRON AGE EUROPE: BEFORE AND AFTER THE ROMAN CONQUEST: Peter S. Wells, University of Minnesota Greek and Roman texts, such as those by Caesar, Strabo, and Tacitus, draw sharp distinctions between Romans and barbarians, and specifically between Romans, Gauls, and Germans. Modern scholarship in history and archaeology typically represents the Roman conquest as a major dis- junction in cultural development in temperate Europe. But new approaches and archaeological discoveries show that, well before the Roman conquest, many Iron Age soci- eties had begun a process of transformation from small rural communities to centers of political power and com- mercial activity, linked to their growing contacts with the Roman world. Contextual analysis of recent excavation re- sults at Late Iron Age settlements such as Villeneuve-St. Germain in France and Manching in Germany helps to clarify the character of these changes. Examination of burials such as those at Hannogne in France, Duhren in Germany, and Goeblingen-Nospelt in Luxembourg allows us to analyze the ways in which Late Iron Age Europeans integrated the Roman goods they imported, as well as Mediterranean practices and rituals they adopted, into their changing social relationships. A new perspective that explains these transformations in Late Iron Age societies also explains the observed effects of the Roman con- quest and subsequent integration of the new provinces into the empire. INSULAR LA TEtNE AND THE COMING OF ROME: PRE-CONQUEST FRONTIER POLICY AND THE "MIRROR STYLE": David Castriota, Sarah Lawrence College In recent times, scholars have come to look increasingly at the dynamics of cultural interaction between the Celtic regions of Western Europe and the classical civilizations of the Mediterranean. This process no longer appears simply as an artistic or material cultural phenomenon, but one that affected Celtic society at all levels, involving issues of economic and military organization, diplomacy, and the ritual display of prestige objects associated with the social elite. Here, I propose to extend this approach to the study of the arts of southeastern Britain in the Late La Tene phase directly preceding the Claudian invasion. Scholars have noted that the most complex manifestation of Insular La Tene art, the so-called "Mirror Style," involved the im- pact of new ideas from Roman decorative arts. Still, there has been no systematic attempt to pursue this connection, or to see it as part of the larger pattern of diplomatic rela- tions between expansionist imperial Roman authorities and the tribal hierarchy that patronized the "Mirror Style." Consequently, I would like to outline the autonomous fea- tures of this phase of La Thne ornament in order to clarify the nature and substance of the Roman artistic impact. U1- timately, I would like to explain this process of reception and transformation as a native British response to the high-level gift exchange comprising Roman decorative sil- ver, bronze, and pottery so well attested in our literary sources and the archaeological record. AT THE END OF THE WORLD: DRUIDIC AND OTHER REVITALIZATION MOVEMENTS IN EARLY POST- CONQUEST GAUL AND BRITAIN: Jane Webster Uni- versity of Leicester Classical ethnographies of the northwestern European peoples conquered by Rome have recently been subject to increasing scrutiny. New approaches to this body of writing owe much to the post-colonial critique of modern West- ern constructs of the colonial "other." In turn, as I argue here, these new readings force archaeologists to chal- lenge traditional assumptions regarding the development of Romano-Celtic societies. Yet is it a testimony to the continuing power of classical rhetoric that some crucial elements of the Graeco-Roman portrait of "Celtic" society remain unchallenged. The dru- ids of Gaul and Britain are a case in point. The classical portrait of a powerful pre-conquest religious/judicial elite, rapidly descending into harmless soothsaying in the after- math of conquest, has been little questioned. Drawing on post-colonial approaches to the literature of contact and culture change, I propose a radical new reading of the role of the post-conquest druids. The druidic response to the conquest, I argue, took the specific form of millennial (or "end of the world") protest. This is a reading that recognizes that experiences of con- quest are discrepant, a point that cannot be accommodated by the traditional model of the homogenous "Romaniza- tion" of the western provinces. For the druids, unlike other more opportunistic sectors of the indigenous elite, the Roman conquest was literally the end of the world. ROMAN INTERACTION IN NORTHWESTERN IBERIA: Martin Millett, University of Durham A range of recent research has addressed the different ways in which the expanding empire of Rome interacted with indigenous societies to produce a variable mosaic of Romanized cultures. This work has been principally con- cerned with areas either on the Mediterranean littoral or in temperate Europe; less emphasis has so far been placed on areas more remote from Mediterranean or military in- fluences, such as the northwestern Iberian peninsula. This area had already achieved a high level of development in the pre-Roman period with the growth of distinctive indig- enous cultures typified by nucleated hilltop sites. In con- trast, it was comparatively underdeveloped in Roman terms, with few towns or major villas. In this paper I discuss the nature of Roman impact in this area, drawing principally on the results of a recently completed fieldwork project in northern Portugal. This work has demonstrated a more complex pattern of Roman rural settlement in the region than had hitherto been rec-</page><page sequence="30">284 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ognized. I relate the evolution of this rural settlement pat- tern to the process of annexation and explore how the overall pattern of the Roman period evolved from that of the Iron Age. The various explanations of these changes are discussed and a model is presented that relates devel- opments in the region to those elsewhere in the empire. ROME FROM AN IRISH PERSPECTIVE: Theresa Early, University of Minnesota Ireland lay beyond the scope of the Roman empire, and thus Strabo (Geog. 4.5.4) could say that "concerning this is- land I have nothing certain to tell, except that its inhabit- ants are more savage than the Britons." Yet the Irish Sea was little more hindrance to travelers than the Danube or the Rhine. Both archaeological and textual sources show that Ireland maintained contact with its neighbors through- out the period of the Roman empire. Indeed, as Roman rule in Britain broke down, various Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms were quick to establish colonies under Irish rule in Wales and Scotland. This paper compares evidence of the economic and social impact Romans and Irish may have had upon each other with evidence from other Roman frontiers. How does the "Irish frontier" differ from the German? For example, "Roman" materials turn up on the richer sites in Ireland, as Irish material appears on sites in the west of Britain. Yet the Irish adopted very little of the Roman way of life before the fifth century, and only selec- tive elements thereafter. By looking at the empire from the perspective of peoples who had the opportunity to adopt Roman culture but largely ignored it, we learn more about the process of Romanization and reevaluate the supremacy of Roman culture. SESSION 2C: COLLOQUIUM: THE REANAL- YSIS OF A WELL DEPOSIT FROM THE SEC- OND CENTURY B.C. IN THE ATHENIAN AGORA: ANIMAL SACRIFICE AND INFAN- TICIDE IN LATE HELLENISTIC ATHENS? BABIES IN WELL G5:3: PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND FUTURE ANALYSIS: Lisa M. Little, Indiana University In 1945J. Lawrence Angel published a short description of human skeletal remains recovered from Well G5:3 in the Athenian Agora (Hesperia 14:311-12). In addition to an adult male and an 11-year-old child, Angel reported that the well contained "about 175 infants." In 1995 it was discovered that the bone material from the well had never been completely sorted, leaving considerable commin- gling of human and faunal remains. Following a resorting of the collection in 1996, the estimated minimum number of infants in the well increased dramatically to 450. The ex- amination of the male adult adds to the unusual nature of this collection. The presence of severe osteoarthritis throughout the joints of his body may suggest extensive de- generative joint disease or a lifetime of habitual heavy labor. The estimation of the age at death of each infant speci- men has demonstrated that, while a few can be classified as fetuses and older infants, the majority of the individuals were neonates. This fact, as well as the size of the collec- tion, raises questions about how the bodies of these infants came to rest in Well G5:3. The remains may represent indi- viduals who died of natural causes and whose bodies were disposed of in the well rather than given formal burial. The practice of infanticide, known through ancient texts, may provide an alternative explanation for the deposit. These hypotheses will be explored in future analyses through the sexing of the infant sample, using both mor- phological and DNA analysis, and the examination of evi- dence for pathology and/or trauma. THE ANIMAL BONES FROM WELL G5:3: DOMESTIC DEBRIS, INDUSTRIAL DEBRIS, AND POSSIBLE EVI- DENCE FOR THE SACRIFICE OF DOMESTIC DOGS IN LATE HELLENISTIC ATHENS: Lynn M. Snyden Smithsonian Institution The domestic dog skeletons and other animal bone de- bris recovered from Well G5:3 in the Athenian Agora re- ceived little immediate notice in 1937/1938, beyond a mention in Hesperia 8 (239) that the bones of "over eighty- five dogs" had been recovered. A brief, unpublished in- ventory of other faunal materials from the well by Gjevall in 1938 listed bones of horse, pig, goat, cattle, cat, birds, and turtles. Restudy of these materials indicates that a number of ac- tivities, both mundane and ritual, were responsible for their presence in the well. Limb bones and cranial debris from domestic pig, cow, and sheep or goat, and fish bones probably came from discarded butchering or food debris. Several broken tools made of cattle scapulas may be cast off fragments of scraping or mixing tools associated with the nearby industrial area. The absolutely unique portion of the animal bone de- posit, however, is the skeletal remains of as many as 150 do- mestic dogs (CanisJamiliaris). These animals ranged in size from small terrier to large shepherd/hunting dog types, and in age from newborn or possibly fetal puppies to aged individuals suffering from worn and missing teeth and ar- thritic bone development. The relatively frequent occur- rence of broken and rehealed limb bones and skulls also indicates that the dogs were probably common urban dwellers, rather than specially bred and raised animals. They were unquestionably associated with the human in- fants in the well. Ancient sources on ritual suggest that the dogs may have been sacrificed in purification rites, per- haps associated with female fertility or childbirth. THE ARTIFACTS FROM WELL G5:3 AND SOME CON- CLUSIONS CONCERNING THE DEPOSIT: Susan I. Rotroff Washington University Stamped amphora handles indicate that the deposit from Well G5:3 in the Athenian Agora was closed around 150 B.C. The surrounding neighborhood was derelict then; houses had been abandoned and other nearby water sources were filled in at the same time. The uniformity of the pottery suggests that the deposit accumulated over a short period of time, although whether this was one or 20 years is difficult to say. Most artifacts are of types familiar</page><page sequence="31">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 285 from domestic dumps elsewhere around the Agora, but some may have special reference to the newborns: a baby feeder, a female herm, and a large number of sizable basins. Although epidemic, famine, and siege have previously been suggested as explanations, this deposit may reflect normal rather than abnormal conditions. An infant was not accepted as a member of the family until the am- phidromia, on the fifth or seventh day after birth. Chil- dren who died before that time would probably not receive formal burial. Natural infant mortality was high; it was also accepted practice not to rear children with any handicap or weakness, and families sometimes chose not to raise healthy girls. Demographic models suggest that, in the normal course of events, Athens could have had sufficient births to account for the number of individuals in the well over a fairly short period of time. The abandoned indus- trial neighborhood in which the well is located offered a secluded spot for exposure or disposal; its proximity to the Agora also offered the comforting possibility that the ex- posed child might be found and reared by others. SESSION 2D: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON SPARTAN WOMEN WOMEN AND THE POPULATION DECLINE AT SPARTA: Sarah B. Pomeroy, Hunter College Existing analyses of the population decline at Sparta fail to appreciate the female role in reproduction. These stud- ies make repeated reference to "manpower" and to the numbers of males of all ages at various dates, but, with only minor exceptions, ignore the number of females and their reproductive failures, successes, and strategies. In this paper I discuss the reproductive economy and focus on Sparta, chiefly because the ancient sources give more di- rect data and commentary on demography at Sparta than they supply for other Greek communities. Eugenics, wife-lending, sterility, breeding by helot part- ners, polyandry, late age of marriage, male infanticide, sex- ual stimuli, state-supported incentives for child produc- tion, and family limitation are among the practices attributed to Spartans. Spartans are the only respectable Greek women we know of who are reported to have exer- cised control over their own fertility. The Spartans, who were notorious for their innocence of business matters, had devised a reproductive calculus as early as the constitution attributed to Lycurgus. Even if sev- eral of the practices I review were Hellenistic, or part of the mirage, it is clear that Sparta served as a kind of laboratory for demographic ideas or actual experiments in which the state and private individuals made investments in order to reap dividends in the form of human capital. EXERCISE, NUDITY, AND SPARTAN FEMALE SEXUAL LICENSE: A RECONSIDERATION: Ellen Greenstein Millende; University of Iowa Scholars who posit the existence of the powerful and sexually liberated Spartan woman have tended to focus on Spartan women's supposed penchant for exercise and for wearing revealing clothing. The ancient literary and ar- chaeological evidence, however, presents a more nuanced picture of Spartan female athletics and the seminudity or nudity that writers have long incorrectly associated with the Spartiate female's daily dress. The ancient sources generally fail to link Spartan women's physical exercise with sexual incontinence. They rather stress its eugenic aim (e.g., DK6 88, fr. 32 [Critias]; Xen. Lac. 1.3-4) and suggest that some of the female sporting events--particularly the foot races-had a ritual significance (cf. Alcm. Parth. 1.39ff; 3.8-9). The seminu- dity and nudity that several ancient sources associate with Spartan women's participation in athletic events further indicate the intermingled eugenic and ritual character of Spartan female exercise. While Critias praises the eugenic benefits of female exercise in the nude, Plutarch (Lyc. 14.4-15.1; Mor. 227e) and a series of Laconian bronzes of ca. 570-470 depicting girls in various states of undress highlight the ritual aspect of athletic nudity and Spartan female exercise and their significant role in Spartan girls' transition to marriage and adult life. In Sparta, consequently, exercise and seminudity or nu- dity belonged to a state-organized system of education and initiation rites for Spartan girls. This comprehensive pro- cess of socialization ultimately served the interests of the male-dominated community and its promotion of mar- riage and healthy offspring. THE WOMEN OF ARTEMIS ORTHIA, SPARTA: Lin Foxhall, University of Leicester In our surviving literary sources, the women of Sparta have been represented by a kind of "butch Madonna" image. Depicted as tough and athletic by our main sources for Ar- chaic and Classical Sparta, Xenophon, Aristotle, and Plu- tarch, they were trained to bear healthy children to serve the state rather than to sit idly and work wool (Xen. Lac. 1.3). This paper is an attempt to penetrate the ideological curtain drawn over the lives of Spartan women as depicted in the literary record by exploring the archaeological re- mains of Spartan women's activities. Domestic and votive deposits of weaving equipment and textile-related artifacts from the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia and the Acropolis of Sparta quite unambiguously represent the remains of women's activity. Much of it, maybe even all of it in the case of the votive deposits, may well also represent the activities of free women of Spartiate status. Preliminary analysis of this material, dating from between the Archaic and Helle- nistic periods, the bulk of it probably sixth-fifth century B.C., suggests that at this time the occupations and con- cerns of Spartan women were more similar to those of women elsewhere in Greece than our literary sources would have us believe. ELITE WOMEN OF ROMAN SPARTA: Nigel M. Kennell, Memorial University of Newfoundland The fascination of Classical Sparta has long lain in the perceived singularity of its institutions, constitutional and social, including the relative freedom afforded women. The later city, in contrast, has suffered from scholarly ne- glect and disparagement, precisely because its distinguish- ing characteristics vanished in the turmoil of the Hellenis-</page><page sequence="32">286 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 tic period. But Spartan history did not end with Leuctra or the Achaean War, and the Roman city is a suitable object of study in its own right. The same holds true for upper-class women in Roman Sparta, whose participation in public life is amply attested (e.g., IG V.1, 573-602). Such activity, though not unusual for the period, makes it possible to draw upon the extensive parallel evidence from other Greek cities to delineate elite women's public lives to a de- gree unattainable for earlier periods. SESSION 2E: MINOAN CRETE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AGHIA PHOTIA: A UNIQUE MM IA BUILDING COMPLEX IN EASTERN CRETE: Heidi M.C. Dierckx, Elmira College, and Metaxia Tsipopoulou, National Archaeological Museum, Athens Aghia Photia lies 5 km east of the modern town of Siteia, in the middle of a plain by the sea. A Middle Mi- noan IA rectangular fortified building stands atop a 26-m hill. This building presents new features, hitherto un- known in Minoan architecture, such as the symmetry and regularity of the ground plan. The existence of a central courtyard may represent the earliest example of a feature characteristic of later palaces. The fortification wall consti- tutes another problem, because we have ignored the his- torical conditions leading to its construction. It is the only Minoan fortification wall completely excavated. Of impor- tance is the presence of clay molds for casting a rare type of double ax. Supporting evidence for the significance of Aghia Photia as a metallurgical center comes from the sub- stantial number of ground stone tools-roughly 600- recovered from the site. Large quantities of querns and whetstones were concentrated in several rooms, indicating that their function was not solely domestic. Some of these tools were probably used in the process of metallurgy. The spatial distribution of the tools is examined and may yield a relation to metallurgical practices within the settlement. It seems probable that a small group of people, possibly from another area of Crete, built Aghia Photia for the ex- ploitation of the plain between Siteia and Palaikastro. This monumental complex contributes to our knowledge of the social organization during this early obscure period. This early concentration of power is significantly connected with metallurgy. MINOAN TOMB ALTARS AND SHRINES: Christofilis Maggidis, Brown University Fixed tomb altars of various types have been identified in several Minoan cemeteries, including Mochlos, Gour- nia, Palaikastro, Aghia Kyriaki, Moni Odigitria, Apesokari, Kamilari, Malia, and Phourni at Archanes. A striking case study, comparable to the Apesokari tholos tomb, is Burial Building 19, a unique semivaulted MM IA-II collective tomb in the Phourni cemetery at Archanes, where the focal points of the funerary ritual were an open-air fixed altar, situated immediately outside the tomb in the area of an unpaved court, an indoor fixed altar, surrounded by the most important burials of the tomb, and an external depository niche, each serving different funerary and rit- ual functions. The comparative analysis of the evidence from all these sites provides a number of criteria for the identification of tomb altars. Furthermore, the topological study of their variations forms the background for an attempt to trace their chronological evolution, geographical/regional dis- tribution, proportional frequency in funerary contexts, particular association with certain types of tombs, and dif- ferences from shrine or palatial altars. The contexts, finds, and offerings associated with the tomb altars, in connec- tion with their precise location and association with other subsidiary structures or areas (paved platforms or unpaved areas, often bordered by a circuit wall and occasionally provided with paved terraces, steps and sidewalks, benches, niches, antechambers, and pillar crypts), shed new light on the function and roles of tomb altars, reveal several aspects of the funerary ritual, and provide evidence of social rank- ing from mortuary contexts. THE PROTOPALATIAL PALACE ECONOMIES OF CRETE AS SYSTEMS OF STAPLE FINANCE: Jan Arvanitakis, University of Toronto Service (1962) defined redistribution -the economic institution characterizing stratified, non-state societies, or "chiefdoms"--as an administered exchange system coordi- nating locally specialized economies. Service's classic ac- count was adapted by Renfrew (1977) to the Aegean con- text in his well-known "subsistence-redistribution" model for the rise of social stratification in the Aegean around 2000 B.C., according to which redistribution appeared as an institutionalized mechanism for distributing agricul- tural surpluses between locally specialized subsistence econ- omies. Accounts of the Minoan palace economies by schol- ars such as Halstead (1981) and Branigan (1988) also have a strong functionalist component. Recent studies (Earle, 1977; Earle and D'Altroy, 1982), however, have indicated that economic systems in other stratified and early-state so- cieties, such as the complex chiefdoms of Hawaii and the Inca state, functioned primarily to mobilize subsistence commodities and labor to finance the elite stratum and its activities. The early palatial period in Crete (MM IB-II) is charac- terized by the appearance of functionally specialized build- ings with clear elite associations. The discovery within these buildings of administrative documents recording consignments of measured amounts of basic staples, and the concentration of storage facilities and of craft work- shops at these centers, imply that specialized production was being performed and financed at the centers. As such, converging streams of evidence suggest the rise in early palatial Crete of a system of staple finance (Polanyi, 1968), rather than a symmetrical redistributional system, within which economic surpluses and labor were mobi- lized from subsistence producers, probably as a fraction of their production, and used to finance the full range of elite activities.</page><page sequence="33">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 287 POTTERY AS A BAROMETER OF ECONOMIC CHANGE IN NEOPALATIAL CENTRAL CRETE: Aleydis Van de Moortel, Seattle Pacific University The Italian excavators of Phaistos and Ayia Triadha in the south-central Cretan plain of the Mesara have sug- gested that, following the destruction of the first Palace at Phaistos, a period of instability led to the establishment of Knossian political domination over the area in the Neopa- latial period. I have attempted to detect the impact of these alleged political changes on the ceramic record of the Me- sara and Knossos. Following Costin, I define pottery pro- duction as an economic activity affected by sociopolitical conditions, among other factors, and thus likely to re- flect major political disruptions of the sort proposed by the Italians. I found indeed drastic changes in the rationale of pot- tery production in the Mesara at the beginning of the Neopalatial period. Labor-intensive production techniques are abandoned, and there is obvious concern with speed- ing up production. Cost-cutting trends also are observed in contemporary pottery from Knossos but there they do not represent a radical change but rather a continuous development beginning much earlier in the Protopala- tial period. The differences between the pottery production of Knossos and the Mesara in the Protopalatial period and their convergent developments in the Neopalatial period are paralleled by trends in contemporary sealing and writ- ing practices. They support the notion of organizational diversity among the early Cretan states in the Protopalatial period, and of increased interregional contacts and unifor- mity in the Neopalatial period. Knossos obviously played a leading role in pottery developments, but need not have dominated the Mesara politically. THE MIDDLE MINOAN III FLORAL LANDSCAPE MOTIF IN POTTERY: Elizabeth Shank, Temple University The pictorialization tendency of Middle Minoan III pot- tery sometimes includes plant and animal motifs, which, in several cases, form what may be titled the "Floral Land- scape Group." In this group, which has not previously been isolated or discussed, individual motifs and landscape ele- ments are combined with the same types of composi- tional organization that are later used in monumental wall paintings. This paper explores whether the MM III landscape mo- tifs in pottery were used in the Late Minoan I period by art- ists creating wall paintings with landscape motifs. The Flo- ral Landscape Group in MM III pottery can be illustrated by examples from Kommos and Phaistos. These examples can be compared to the "Blue Monkey" and "Blue Bird" frescoes from Knossos and the "Spring Fresco" and Minia- ture Landscape Frieze from Akrotiri. Comparisons are based on a study of composition, technique, and the usage of individual and combined motifs. In conclusion, the hy- pothesis that these MM III landscape motifs in pottery con- stitute the point of origin for the LM I landscape motif in wall paintings must be considered, and a case can be made for the existence of a limited relationship between aspects of the landscape motif on pottery and wall paintings. THE POLITICS OF DANCING: THE REPRESENTATION OF DANCING WOMEN AND LATE BRONZE AGE PALATIAL SOCIETY: Senta C. German, Columbia University Recent work on representations of bulls and bull leap- ing in the Bronze Age Aegean poses these images as the vi- sual expression of political ideology in Neopalatial Crete. These arguments are based on the frequent occurrence of these images on seals and sealings, their prominence in wall paintings at Knossos, and their currency abroad. Using these same criteria, I propose that images of dancing women functioned in the same way. In my paper I first establish dancing as a formal icono- graphic type in the visual culture of the Minoans and Mycenaeans and bring together examples from palatial wall paintings, glyptic art, and foreign contexts. Next, not- ing the similarity of this repertoire and that of bulls and bull leaping, I argue that images of dancing women also functioned as potent symbols in palatial society both on Crete as well as on the mainland. This paper not only fur- thers our understanding of "political art" in the ancient Mediterranean but, by focusing on images of women in this sphere, it expands our understanding of the kinds of roles this group might have played in Aegean Bronze Age culture. Two NEW POPPY-SHAPED RHYTA FROM THE LM III CEMETERY AT MOCHLOS: Ann M. Nicgorshi, Willamette University In 1993, the Greek-American excavation team at Moch- los discovered two matching rhyta in Tomb 13 of the Myce- naean cemetery. The shape and decoration of these rhyta are unusual. The shape suggests an organic prototype, spe- cifically an opium poppy capsule. The painted decoration includes the unparalleled motif of upright, open lozenges that resemble the vertical cuttings made in actual poppy capsules to extract opium. Like the goddess with the tiara of poppy capsules from Gazi (LM IIIB) and the pyxis with painted poppy capsules, birds, and horns of consecration found in a chamber tomb at Pachyammos (LM IIIA), these poppy-shaped rhyta provide important evidence for the use of opium in religious and funerary rituals on LM III Crete. Curiously, these poppy-shaped rhyta are also decorated with a characteristic six-armed Mycenaean octopus. Several scholars have suggested that this octopus motif, occurring almost exclusively on ritual pottery from funerary con- texts, is a symbol of rebirth related to the octopus's ability to regenerate lost arms. The juxtaposition of this octopus motif with the poppy-capsule shape is certainly to be un- derstood as a reference to the idea of cyclical renewal in nature. In the funerary context, the opium poppy repre- sents the sleep of death, just as it later comes to represent</page><page sequence="34">288 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 the sleep of nature during winter as an attribute of Deme- ter. Coupled with the six-armed octopus, a symbol of re- generation, the poppy-shaped rhyta from Mochlos express the hope that death is only one phase in a natural cycle that leads to rebirth and renewed life. SESSION 2F: LATE ANTIQUE ICONOGRA- PHY AND STYLE THE APOTHEOSIS OF ANTONINUS PIUS IN 161 AND 461: David H. Wright, University of California, Berkeley The apotheosis relief on the base of the column of An- toninus Pius is a familiar landmark. The ivory half-diptych in the British Museum depicting the apotheosis of an un- identified emperor remains an enigma. On stylistic grounds we can place it in Rome in the mid-fifth century but its monogram has never been read satisfactorily and offers no help for interpretation. The Divus is certainly an emperor but it cannot be Julian (as frequently suggested) because there is no dia- dem and no long pointed beard; the head does resemble Antoninus Pius, the toga suggests an Antonine date, and the details of the apotheosis iconography are specifically suitable for him. Antoninus had a very high reputation in Late Antiquity. It seems likely, therefore, that this ivory was carved in 461 to celebrate the tercentenary of his deifica- tion, when this iconography was long out of use. The artist introduced a new feature in showing ances- tors receiving the Divus but he followed common ancient iconography for the pyre and for the figure being carried aloft. On the other hand, he must have had a model of An- tonine date for the elephant quadriga with the statue of the Divus, an iconography documented on coins of An- toninus Pius, Lucius Verus, and Marcus Aurelius, but not later. The varied actions and correct anatomy of the four mahouts are too well understood to have been invented in 461 and they could not have been deciphered in a coin image. Therefore, the ivory must reflect some lost monu- ment of the Antonine period, perhaps a relief recording the ceremony of the deification for Antoninus in 161. THE MOSAIC HUNTERS OF ANTIOCH-ON-THE- ORONTES: SIGNS OF IMPERIAL VIRTUS OR GOOD FORTUNE? Laura A. Voight, Brown University The imperial hunt motif, depicted countless times from the Hellenistic period onward, represents the symbol of princely virtus. In 1947, D. Levi posited that at Antioch this motif, found in mosaics dating to the fourth through sixth centuries A.D., still carried its original meaning of imperial virtus. That is, the Antiochian use of the hunter motif, ei- ther on horseback or on foot, spearing an animal, was not necessarily influenced by the genre-derived hunt scenes that dominated North African floors of the period; Anti- och's preference for allegorical themes largely excluded such mundane genre subjects from its repertoire. In this papei, however, I argue that the victorious hunter has been imbued with a more popular, less imperial function than was previously recognized: he has become a symbol of good fortune. An indication that this is the case in the Antioch scenes is that the hunter's garb has changed: he now wears the contemporary costume of the exomis adorned with clavi and segmenta. Most of the later mosaic floors from Antioch contained abstract personifications with apotropaic pow- ers or general themes of good fortune; these figures were similarly dressed in contemporary garb. The floors depict- ing the hunt scenes are seemingly anomalous if they are bereft of such symbolism. But can the hunter then be in- terpreted as a symbol of good fortune as well? Recent re- search has indeed found that the motif of the hunter spearing an animal was a commonly employed good luck symbol, from amulets to textile ornamentation. Thus, these mosaic hunters should be "read" not so much as de- scendants of imperial virtus, but rather as apotropaic sym- bols, dressed in contemporary garb, bringing prosperous good luck to the household. ORIGINALITY AND DESIGN IN THE GREAT PAL- ACE MOSAIC, CONSTANTINOPLE: Martin Beck- mann, McMaster University The twin issues of originality and design source are only two of the many controversies surrounding the Great Pal- ace Mosaic at Constantinople. In this paper, through an identification and discussion of the significance of a Late Roman transport amphora depicted in the mosaic, I at- tempt to shed light on both these issues. The scene in question depicts a boy bending over an amphora that, through comparison with amphora types known archaeo- logically to have been current when the mosaic was laid, can be identified as the type known to modern scholars as Late Roman Amphora (LRA) type 1. The primary signifi- cance of this identification is that it demonstrates that at least this component of the mosaic's decoration was taken from contemporary life. Either this scene was copied from a contemporary copybook (or, as has been more recently suggested, a manuscript) or, perhaps more likely, was com- posed in full or in part on the spot. Any discussion of the methods followed by the mosaic's designers must now ac- knowledge the possibility of custom, on-the-spot composi- tion, a factor that emphasizes the originality of the mosaic. Moreover, there is an interesting correspondence between the known production sites of LRA 1 and the known ex- amples of figure-carpet mosaics (the stylistic group to which the Great Palace mosaic belongs): both are con- centrated in southeastern Asia Minor and northwestern Syria, a correspondence that may bear on the origin of the mosaic's designer. EARLY CHRISTIAN PAINTING IN THE CATACOMB OF CALLISTUS: THE RHETORIC OF EMPIRE: Kathleen Enz Finken, Moorhead State University Recent scholarship in the history of art and in archaeol- ogy seeks to clarify our understanding of the growth and development of Christianity in the context of pagan Ro- man culture. The theme of death and burial is one area that has received significant attention. This paper ad- dresses the relationship between the earliest Christian pro- grams of tomb decoration (Catacomb of Callistus, ca. 195- 215) and traditional pagan Roman programs. Foundation myths found in the pagan Roman funerary setting estab-</page><page sequence="35">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 289 lish the cultural matrix for understanding the programs of decoration in these earliest Christian tombs. Reconstitut- ing the programs of decoration in these early tomb cham- bers reveals a programmatic emphasis on the history of sal- vation as outlined by Christian apologists of the second and third centuries. Salvation history established an ances- tral heritage of great antiquity for the newly formed Church and answered the charges of the new and revolu- tionary character of the Christian religion brought by pagan detractors. The method of selection and display of images revealed in these tombs, where disparate images are torn from their immediate narrative context and placed within the great and expansive narrative of the his- tory of salvation, is in accord with pagan Roman examples that also purport to promote the history of their "race" or family. In addition, the purposeful manipulation of the tra- ditional funerary themes of triumph and sacrifice reveals the Christians as inheritors of Roman tradition, even as they redefined themselves as members of a group whose identity was based on shared religion. THE MOSAIC FLOOR OF THE BYZANTINE MONASTIC CHURCH AT KHIRBET YATTIR: Joanne F Besonen, Tufts University The remains of Khirbet Yattir, a large ancient village, is located in the southern Judaean mountain region, south of Hebron. This village, mentioned in the Bible, both in the Book of Joshua and 1 Samuel, was occupied from the third millennium B.C. through the 14th century A.D. Excavations, which have been carried on since the summer of 1995, have uncovered two Byzantine (sixth- century) public buildings and a monastic church of the same period, paved with a unique mosaic floor. The mo- saic, which contains unusual symbols considered to be magical in nature, and abbreviations of holy names, a dated inscription, and a large central circle with a Byzantine- style processional cross, leaves major questions open for in- terpretation. Were the symbols intended for magic or were they strictly for decorative purposes? What was the sect that occupied or used this basilical church? Were they Christian or a Jewish-Christian sect? In this paper I present the results of my investigation of this enigmatic mosaic and attempt to answer some of these intriguing questions. THE POST-ANTIQUE LIFE OF SACRED LANDSCAPE IN THE VALLEY OF THE MUSES: Amy Papalexan- drou, Pennsylvania State University In the Byzantine period, as in antiquity, the Valley of the Muses was regarded as a sacred site. This is clear from the unusually large number of churches and monasteries erected there, at least nine of which are known to have ex- isted and one of which still stands today. It is at present dif- ficult to determine the nature and extent of this commu- nity during the medieval period, primarily due to the fact that the buildings were systematically and completely dis- mantled during the late 19th century to expose and liber- ate the vast number of antiquities used in the construction of their walls. The purpose of the present paper is to inves- tigate the medieval form and appearance of the buildings found within the Valley of the Muses and to examine the importance of this site during the Byzantine period. Spe- cial consideration is given to the incorporation and place- ment of ancient spolia within the medieval walls as well as to the potential significance of this act in a region where the ancient past was still highly regarded in the Middle Byzantine period. Early travelers' accounts, archaeological reports, and the observation of existing remains are all considered in an attempt to clarify the post-Antique form and meaning of this sacred landscape. SESSION 2G: REMEMBERING THE DEAD: ROMAN FUNERARY RELIEFS LATE REPUBLICAN FUNERARY RELIEFS FROM AMIT- ERNUM DEPICTING A FREEDMAN AS MAGISTER LUDI: Lisa A. Hughes, Indiana University Road construction in 1879 prompted excavations at San Vittorino situated between the modern towns of Preturo and L'Aquila and located approximately 85 km northeast of Rome. The finds, now in the Museo L'Aquila, include an interesting group of reliefs and inscriptions of local limestone from the necropolis of ancient Amiternum. One relief depicts two men in combat with their attendants, the other a funeral procession. The dates of both reliefs in addition to the identity and status of the deceased are controversial. This study of the Amiternum reliefs dem- onstrates through a close examination of military equip- ment, hair, and clothing styles that these reliefs date to the Late Republic. Moreover, this study provides evidence that these reliefs belonged to the tomb of a freedman who held a position of office at Amiternum. Because freedmen living in Rome during the Republic did not hold magistracies, the general assumption has been that this was also true for the rest of Italy, and that no Italian freedman could become a magis- trate prior to the organization by Augustus of the collegia of the Augustales in various municipalities and colonies. This assumption is clearly incorrect. One inscription, CIL IX, 4226, previously unassociated with these reliefs reveals that a freedman served as magister ludi at Amiternum. This inscription, as well as the magisterial lists from Capua, pro- vides further support that freedmen held positions of office during the Republic, at least outside of the capital. THE ROMAN FUNERARY ROUNDELS FROM MACE- DONIA IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM OF THESSALONIKI: Chrissula loakimidou, University of Thessaloniki The Roman funerary roundels in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki (exhibition and inventories) comprise a group of 20 reliefs presented here in the con- text of the basic characteristics of the type. These tondi fall within a larger set of 140 similar monuments collected (by the author) to date from the region that was once the Roman province of Macedonia and the island of Thasos. The roundels of this type were private monuments carved in marble, usually white, ranging in diameter from 45 to 90 cm. They date to the first three centuries A.D. Their frames are either left plain or decorated with orna-</page><page sequence="36">290 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ments in relief (interlacing design, astragal, or Ionic egg- and-dart molding). Some of these tondi stood on a short rectangular base, while others were fixed in the walls of fu- nerary monuments. The roundels portray figures of men, women, and children in bust form, arranged in two or three tiers. The depicted figures range in number from two to nine. In this paper I consider not only the artistic value of these funerary roundels, but also attempt to interpret them contextually, as products of their time and society. Special attention is given to issues such as the historical cir- cumstances under which they were created, their original location, as well as the individuals who commissioned and the artists who crafted them. Artistic and dating issues are also addressed, as are discussions regarding the origin of the Macedonian roundel from the imago clipeata (i.e., the Hellenistic and Roman custom of depicting figures on round shields). THE DOUBLE BIND: EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE FOR THE LIBERTA-CONIUNX: Caroline E. Dexter, George Washington University The huge number of extant Roman funerary inscrip- tions provides a tantalizing glimpse of the varieties of per- sonal relationships among inhabitants of the Roman world. This presentation examines the epigraphic evidence of one specific relationship: the situation in which a woman is both the freedwoman (liberta) and the spouse (coniunx) of the same man. While this twofold relationship has been noted by various modern writers, a closer examination of the legal status and obligations of the woman in such a sit- uation sheds light on both relationships. For example, a freeborn woman had her birth family as natural allies, in the event of difficulties, but the freed- woman-spouse had the freedwoman's legal obligations to her patron with none of the legal or economic protections that a freeborn wife might expect from a birth family. A wife could initiate divorce, but could a wife who owed the obligations of a freedwoman to her patron do so? Legal sources help us to understand the obligations and status of a former slave, and also of a wife; exploring the in- tersection of the two can offer insights into the complex social relationships of the ancient Romans. Legal sources offer principle, but by examining the wording of the in- scriptions themselves, as well as the placement and context of the monuments, we can catch a glimpse of practice: do we see the bonds of affection so rarely perceivable-or is this just another double bind? THE STATUS OF WINE VENDORS ON ROMAN FUNER- ARY RELIEFS: Alexis Young, McMaster University The importance of the wine trade during the Roman empire is well known. That wine was the popular beverage of choice can be seen in the widespread distribution of wine amphoras, the remains of wine installations, and the many visual images of viticulture including the imbibing of the finished product. Evidence of the vendors who sold wine is limited to a small number of inscriptions, wall paintings, and funerary reliefs. This paper focuses on a small group of second- and third-century funerary reliefs of wine vendors from Italy and Roman Gaul. The depictions of wine vending show a transaction taking place in the settings of taverns, cellae vinariae, or wine shops with distinctive wine-dispensing counters. How these vendors presented themselves on their tombs aids in defining not only their occupational status, but also their position in Roman society. It is argued here that their dress, gestures, and the objects that they hold, in conjunction with the iconographic elements of setting, represent the desire of these vendors to show for the sake of posterity that they had achieved prosperity and success during their lifetimes through their work. The vi- sual evidence on tombs also implies that the selling of wine, a prestige product in itself, would have further en- hanced the perceived social status of these vendors. ACCULTURATION, APPROPRIATION, AND INNOVA- TION: FUNERARY PRODUCTION AND COMMEM- ORATION IN REGIO X, ITALY: Laurel Taylor, University of Pennsylvania The funerary monuments of the Roman provinces have significant-though rarely exploited-potential to illumi- nate acculturation among diverse populations in the Ro- man empire. This case study, part of a larger thesis examin- ing funerary production in three provinces of the Roman West (Regio X, Aquitania, and Cyrenaica), considers the funerary monuments of Regio X in northeast Italy and out- lines major trends in the commemorative traditions of this area. Although there is a perceptible urban/rural dimen- sion in the monuments of Regio X, exemplified at one end of the spectrum by large urban mausolea with freestanding sculpture (Aquileia), and at the other by anthropomor- phic stelae from rural areas (Adria), the bulk of evidence does not fall easily into topographical binaries. Rather, commemorative habits are specific to site and, often, cul- ture. One of the largest cities, Brescia, lacks monumental tombs entirely, producing epigraphical stelae as the pri- mary commemorative mode for its mixed population and portrait stelae for its Celtic inhabitants, while second-tier cities, like Altino and Este, produce standard stele types as well as original, idiosyncratic monument series. What emerges are not distinct urban/rural patterns but zones in which certain types flourish and which may be reflections of the geographical areas-a western plain and an eastern littoral-of the pre-Roman Celtic and Venetic cultures. The evidence from Regio X, a province with multiethnic substrata and a vigorous Late Republican Roman cultural tradition, is important for mapping how populations re- spond to Roman cultural forms and how provincial Romans themselves are inventive. APA PRESIDENTIAL PANEL: THE APA HON- ORS THE AIA'S 100TH ANNUAL MEETING: CLASSICS AND MATERIAL CULTURE ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE: Robin Osborne, Oxford University In this paper I endeavor to show how the interpretation of individual archaeological phenomena needs to take place in the context of broad-brush archaeological pat- terns, and how literary and archaeological evidence needs</page><page sequence="37">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 291 to be read together if historians and archaeologists are to make progress with the interpretation of texts and mate- rial remains. In 1961 J.M. Cook argued that the failure of the Ionians to build as much in the fifth century as they did in the sixth needed explaining, and he proposed to explain it by the impoverishment of an Ionia that he argued was paying both to Athens and Persia under the Athenian empire. Whether Ionia was paying both ways has been debated, but that the absence of monumental building implies Ionian impoverishment as a result of Athenian imperialism has become a regularly repeated "fact." How are we to interpret the failure of a Greek state to erect monumental buildings? By surveying the record of other cities within the empire, I try to establish that Ionia was not peculiar within the Athenian empire, and by com- paring the record of cities within the empire with that of cities outside, I argue that the cities of the Athenian em- pire were not peculiar within the mainland Greek and Ae- gean world. But if impoverishment will not explain failure to build, what will? By looking more closely at the places where and times when monumental building occurred, I argue that building relates more closely to assertion of identity than to wealth. In the context of the Athenian empire, whether we interpret the failure to build as a sign of oppression or a sign of the popularity of Athens will depend on, but also af- fect, the way in which we read the literary evidence. CULTURE AND HISTORY AT POMPEY'S MUSEUM: Ann Kuttner University of Pennsylvania Abstract not available. THE PSEUDO-HISTORY OF MESSENIA UNPLUGGED: Susan E. Alcock, University of Michigan One can read, in perfectly respectable scholarly ac- counts, that Archaic and Classical Messenia had no history or, at any rate, no history of its own, and few worthwhile monuments. Responsible for this unhappy state of affairs, of course, was Sparta's domination and exploitation of the region. With Epaminondas and freedom, however, came the need to make a past, to create some memories, to for- get the conquest years-the need to spin a pseudo-history for use in Hellenistic and Roman times. In this paper I set out to unpick certain aspects of this story. Some elements are already well unraveled, not least the denial of history to conquered peoples and the not- always-hidden scorn for "invented traditions." Other pit- falls are now beginning to be recognized; for example, our collective willingness to be bear-led by Pausanias, without sufficient attention to the Guide's agenda or designs. None of these mildly deconstructive remarks, however, do away with what has been called "the problem of Messe- nian history." Basic questions remain: how did the once- subject, once-exiled Messenians respond to their radical social and political transformation? Just how did they choose to construct and present what had happened to them, and its relationship to their more antique past? Pres- sure to acknowledge matters such as these has increased, even for classicists, in a late 20th-century, postcolonial climate-so how to approach these issues afresh? One option is to turn to the sacred and memorial land- scape of Messenia, seeking evidence for changes in com- memorative practices and in mythic and historical empha- ses. This paper examines monumental and cultic continuities, revivals, radical alterations, and new founda- tions, scanning both the Hellenistic and Roman periods in city and countryside. Signs of sanctuary use and monu- mental veneration continuing from earlier times belie the notion of total disjunction between periods of servitude and freedom; on the other hand, new cults, and revisions of ritual practice and patronage, reflect close awareness of postliberation, and then Roman imperial, conditions and contingencies. The dominant version of the Messenian past celebrated emerges as less of a new invention, than an ongoing reinvention - engaging with certain memories, discarding others-a process continually seen, if not de- clared "pseudo," elsewhere in the ancient, and not-so- ancient, world. HOUSEHOLD ARCHAEOLOGY AND GENDER IDEOL- OGY IN ARCHAIC GREECE: Ian Morris, Stanford University In this paper I combine archaeological and textual evi- dence to construct a new model of gender ideologies in Early Archaic Greece. Feminist historians of modern peri- ods emphasize household space as a way to make sense of gender dynamics. The Greek textual evidence is poor, but archaeology points to changes in the use of household space in Aegean Greece in the eighth and seventh centu- ries B.C. I suggest that these mark a decisive turning point. Dark Age houses (ca. 1100-750) were typically one- room, curvilinear structures, in which all activities went on in a single space or in the open air. Artifacts from house floors and the areas in front of houses confirm this. But starting around 750, we see the gradual emergence of new multiroom, rectilinear houses; by 600 the kind of court- yard house typical of Classical sites was normal all over the Aegean. The best evidence comes from Zagora on Andros, where one-room houses were rebuilt with the multiple, functionally distinct rooms around 725/700. In contrast to the Dark Age houses, food storage, cooking, and feasting went on in distinct spaces. These are strongly gendered ac- tivities in the literary sources from Hesiod to Demos- thenes. Before 750, the kind of "gender asymmetry" that some archaeologists see as fundamental to the Classical courtyard house would have been difficult to maintain; but by 600 it was built into the physical space experienced by most Greeks in the Aegean area. I link these changes in household structure to equally significant changes in religious space. I suggest that in the eighth and seventh centuries there was a new symbolic chopping-up of human space, creating new boundaries. Classical ideologies of gender, ethnicity, class, and cosmol- ogy were not timeless, but emerged in their broad outlines between about 750 and 650 B.C. "MORE ITALY THAN PROVINCE": LAND, FOOD, AND CULTURE CHANGE IN ROMAN PROVENCE: R. Bruce Hitchner University of Dayton Agrorum cultu, virorum morumque dignatione, amplitu- dine opum, nulli provinciarum postferanda breviterque Ita- lia venius quam provincia. (Plin. HN3.31)</page><page sequence="38">292 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 The Elder Pliny's famous assessment has long been read as testament to the profound impact of Roman-Italian cul- ture on Provence. But what does Pliny mean precisely when he states that Provence was "more Italy than prov- ince"? Recent archaeology relating to land use, produc- tion, and culinary tastes in Roman Provence, in tandem with literary and documentary evidence, provides some an- swers to this question. Material and epigraphic evidence from the lower Rhone valley, for example, points to significant wetland reclamation efforts to increase food production modeled on comparable entrepreneurial drainage schemes under- taken in Italy in the late republic and early empire. The re- sulting changes to parts of the Provenial landscape reflect the adoption and implementation of specifically Roman- Italian attitudes toward the environment that remained a hallmark of the province's agricultural economy through the end of antiquity, but not significantly into the Medi- eval period. No less interesting in this regard are newly integrated archaeozoological data from a broad range of sites in Roman Provence relating to shellfish production and con- sumption. Specifically, the evidence indicates a major shift from mussel consumption centered on coastal communi- ties to a broad regional and social preference for oysters in imitation of contemporary Italian culinary tastes, but also reflecting new economic opportunities related to the in- troduction of Roman rule. While certainly lending clarifi- cation to the Plinian vision of an Italianized Provence, this change in culinary tastes ultimately gave rise to a set of so- cial and economic realities in Provence that proved quite distinct from the Italian experience, but which, again, did not extend beyond the late antique period. These and other examples considered in my paper demonstrate not only the particular nature and evolution of cultural change and invention in Roman Provence, but also the nourishing effect on our knowledge and under- standing of the ancient world of blending archaeological and textual evidence. SESSION 3A: GOLD MEDAL COLLOQUIUM IN HONOR OF ANNA MARGUERITE McCANN ARCHAEOLOGY ON EARTH'S LAST FRONTIER: DEEP- WATER ARCHAEOLOGY AT SKERKI BANK: John Peter Oleson, University of Victoria In the 1960s and 1970s, Anna Marguerite McCann di- rected pioneering work on Roman and Etruscan harbors in the shallow coastal waters of Italy. In 1989, she became a pioneer once again by serving as Project Archaeologist for the deep-water survey and excavation of a Roman ship- wreck at a depth of 850 m near Skerki Bank in the Mediter- ranean, directed by Robert Ballard. The Jason Project proved the feasibility of scientific study and recording of ancient shipwreck sites on the deep ocean floor through the use of manned and unmanned submersibles and an array of data-collection devices. In 1997 McCann and Bal- lard returned to the Skerki Bank survey area with even more sophisticated submersibles and recording tools, and carried out survey and artifact sampling on five Ro- man and four more recent shipwrecks. The images and artifacts recovered provided new data on Roman trade routes, cargo stowage, and subsidiary cargoes. In addi- tion, the project successfully integrated a specially re- cruited team of scientists with expertise in oceanography, engineering, hydrodynamics, archaeology, and conserva- tion. Shipwreck sites are particularly rich in archaeologi- cal data, and the remarkable preservation of deep-water wrecks marks them out as a major source of future archae- ological knowledge-one that must be protected from commercial exploitation. THE PORT OF COSA AND ECONOMIC ROMANIZA- TION IN GAUL AND THE DANUBE VALLEY: Eliza- beth Lyding Will, University of Massachusetts, Amherst The pioneering excavations at the Port of Cosa by Anna Marguerite McCann and her team uncovered important parts of that facility and confirmed the roles of the port and of the Sestius family as longstanding, major contribu- tors to the economic Romanization of Gaul and of the Danube valley as far east as Manching. The publication of the port in 1987 marked a milestone in our knowledge of Roman trade. Evidence of an economic connection be- tween Cosa and Gaul had been published as early as 1956, when study of finds from Frank Brown's excavations on the hill of Cosa revealed an unusually large number of Sestius amphora stamps datable on the basis of Athenian Agora contexts to the late second and early first centuries B.C. At the same time, coincidentally, the upper Grand Congloue wreck off Marseilles, explored in 1952 and filled with hun- dreds of Sestius amphoras, seemed logically to be one of the ships that took wine from Cosa to Gaul. There, we know from Cicero (Rep. 3.16), Rome had practiced protec- tionism as early as 129 B.C. McCann's excavations of the harbor facilities at the port of Cosa support Cicero's state- ment. Like the port (and the hill) of Cosa, Gaul is full of stamps of the Sestii, the powerful Roman family whose properties at Cosa, mentioned by Cicero (Att. 15.27.1), produced wine and garum sent chiefly to Gaul, but also to the Danube valley, and as far east as the Aegean. ROME'S TRADE WITH INDIA: NEW DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE: Lionel Casson, New York University We have long been aware that the trade that Roman Egypt carried on with India involved the import from there of costly goods. A recently published papyrus document dating from the second century A.D. provides proof in a form we rarely come upon in ancient contexts-facts and figures. The recto contains details of an agreement drawn up in Muziris, the commercial center of southern India, concerning a shipment to Egypt. The verso contains an ac- count that deals with the goods in that shipment; the pre- served portion lists specific quantities of ivory, nard, and fabric and their value; these plus three other parcels item- ized in the lost portion had a total value of no less than 1,154 talents-a sum that would pay the wages of all the soldiers in a Roman legion for a year. The men who drew</page><page sequence="39">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 293 up the agreement, in other words, had a formidable amount of capital at their disposal. A seagoing vessel of merely average size could have carried 50 such shipments or even more. Fully loaded with such goods, they were ver- itable treasure ships. A NEW CATALOGUE OF SIGNED ITALIAN TERRA SIGILLATA: WHAT 36,000 VESSELS CAN TELL US ABOUT ROMAN CRAFT AND TRADE: Philip Ken- rick, University of Oxford The fine red terra sigillata made in Italy during the Au- gustan period and the first century A.D. was traded throughout the Roman empire and beyond. It influenced existing styles of pottery production and gave rise to new provincial industries to an extent that is otherwise unparal- leled in the Roman period. The presence of makers' marks on these vessels gives us an opportunity to investigate the history and trade patterns of individual production centers at a level of detail that is also unsurpassed. The compilation of a universal catalogue of such marks was begun by August Ox&amp; of Krefeld in 1896 and the cata- logue was subsequently brought to publication by Howard Comfort of Haverford College in 1968. This catalogue comprised some 18,000 entries. Now a second edition of this work is nearing completion: this is based on Ox&amp;'s original notes, further material recorded by Comfort dur- ing many years of museum visits (particularly to American collections that were not accessible to Ox&amp;), and another 50 years of published excavation reports and monographs. The new catalogue will be published on CD-ROM and will contain approximately 36,000 entries. The medium of publication will facilitate a wide range of inquiries into the nature of this important industry. Examples of its potential as a basis for archaeological, historical, and economic re- search are presented. HELLENISTIC TEXT ILLUSTRATION AND ARRETINE POTTERY: Maria Teresa Marabini Moevs, Rutgers University A fragmentary mold signed by Perennius Bargathes, therefore belonging to the third (Tiberian) phase of the most important workshop of Arretine pottery, bears a scene so far unexplained. Here an "Eselmensch," or a man with the head of an ass, is brandishing a club in an attempt to fend off the attack of two personages from both sides. He has just set himself free from a thong whose extremity can be seen in the hand of the figure to the right. This eld- erly man, who is wearing a wild animal skin, holds a knife in his left hand. From the left a monkey-headed personage strides in with menacing countenance. He holds in his right hand a small situla and brandishes in the other an unusual weapon similar to a big hook. The features of the personages, their costume and in- struments, and especially the action in which they were ini- tially involved, which meant the capture, binding and sacri- fice of a human figure with the head of an ass, correspond in detail to the ritual for the destruction of the god Seth, the principle of chaos and evil in Egyptian religion. The fight between Seth and the god of order and goodness, Horus, assisted by the monkey-headed Thot, appears al- ready in the Pyramid Texts, but only in the Late Dynastic and Hellenistic periods did it acquire great popularity. In these times the image of the god as a donkey-headed man along with the magic rites to exorcize his power became fa- miliar, offering in the meanwhile a good pretext for merri- ment to the satirical vein of the Greeks of Egypt. A mime where Seth is transformed from assailed into assailant fits well that trend of desecration that in Greek theater goes back to at least the fifth century B.C. In a broader context the circulation in Hellenistic Alex- andria of a mime of the "Eselmensch" Seth, now attested by the illustration preserved on the Arretine mold, finally provides definite support to those scholars who had postu- lated the existence of such a mime as the original Egyptian source of Lucius or the Ass, possibly by Lucian, and the Meta- morphoses of Apuleius. A PORTRAIT OF A SEX-SLAVE "STUD" (?) IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART IN NEW YORK: John Pollini, University of Southern California In 1914, G.M.A. Richter, Curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, ac- quired a rather unusual portrait head of good quality dat- ing to the late first-early second century A.D. Richter's brief acquisition notice described this as a "not so common Roman representation of a barbarian, wearing long hair with prominent cheekbones and an aquiline nose." Forty- three years later, in her pictorial catalogue Roman Portraits, she was even more laconic, noting only that the youth por- trayed was "evidently a barbarian." Aside from these few comments, this portrait has attracted little attention, at least until very recently. As we now know, the "feminized" iconographical hairstyle of this youth marks him out as a slave, a fact that was not realized by Richter. As such, he was probably an enslaved barbarian or a youth born into sla- very (verna). In Roman imperial art, priestly sacrificial assistants, min- istrants in triumphal processions bearing certain objects, and sex-slaves were commonly represented wearing similar "feminized" hairstyles. However, unlike these individuals, who were invariably portrayed as androgynous-looking and/or as idealized types, the male portrayed in the Metro- politan Museum head has rugged and rather unhandsome features. In this paper, I propose that this portrait repre- sents a male slave whose other "assets" probably out- weighed his looks. Well-endowed sex-slaves and/or prosti- tutes are mentioned in Latin literature, but thus far no visual portraits of them have been identified. OUT OF THE WATER: THE WOODEN THRONE FROM VERUCCHIO: Larissa Bonfante, New York University The recently restored wooden throne exhibited in the Museo Civico in Bologna was found in a rich grave of the mid-seventh century B.C. from Verucchio, in Romagna. It is remarkable not only in the unusual preservation of the wood but in the scenes that decorated the back. The semi- circular back of the throne, of a shape familiar from other</page><page sequence="40">294 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 thrones of this period, is decorated on the inside with a carved design representing scenes of wool working. It shows sheep pasturing and being sheared, and two women weaving in the courtyard or doorway of a house. The sub- ject of the decoration is similar to that of a bronze pendu- lum or tintinnabulum in Bologna cleaned in 1975, 100 years after its discovery: there, women are represented cleaning the wool, spinning, and weaving it on a remark- able two-story loom.

Nikolaenko, National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos In this paper we attempt to synthesize the results of re- cent investigations in the chora of Chersonesos and high- light those aspects that are the object of ongoing investiga- tion. The chora of Chersonesos is the outstanding example of systematic Greek land division--a fact that has long been recognized. The first published plan of the area dates to 1786, and until very recently it was the only one. We present in this paper a new plan and a geomorphologi- cal analysis of landscape changes based on ongoing re- mote sensing research. The topics covered include 1) rela- tions with the pre-Greek population; 2) the date of the division of the chora and contraction and destruction of the fortified farmhouses; and 3) the economic basis of the chora as revealed by studies of the internal divisions of the regular plots, the analysis of pottery types from the ex- cavation of farmhouses, palaeobotanical investigation, and studies of faunal remains. These subjects are discussed in relation to what is known from documentary sources about the history of the colony, both polis and chora, and against the wider background of studies of the agricultural settle- ments of Western Crimea, summarized by A. Scheglov in Polis et Chora (Besangon 1992). ON THE PERIPHERY OF EMPIRES: TAURIC CHER- SONESOS IN THE HELLENISTIC, ROMAN, AND BYZ- ANTINE PERIODS: Douglas R Edwards, University of Puget Sound In this paper I examine the complex interactions be- tween colonial powers, indigenous peoples, and "barbari- ans" in and around ancient Chersonesos, one of the busi- est port cities in the Black Sea region. The city retained autonomous status throughout most of its early history de- spite its contentious relations with the Mithridatic king- dom and its importance for the Romans in the first and second centuries A.D. Chersonesos represents a unique opportunity to examine in some detail the interaction of various ethnic and cultural groups in a city known throughout the ancient world. Two key questions frame this paper. First, how does the archaeological evidence from this peripheral city reflect its encounter with the colonial center from the fifth century B.C. to the seventh century A.D.? Second, what does the ar- chaeological record tell us about the interaction of various groups within the city and with the nearby chora? Special at- tention is paid to how local elites negotiated the delicate task of maintaining ties to representatives of the colonial power and to the local population. Evidence of this rela- tionship includes the following: 1) signs of collaboration (education, building programs, epigraphic pronounce- ments, religious affiliation, appropriation of imperial sym- bols); 2) resistance to imperial power (rebellion, redefini- tion of imperial or colonial symbols within a new symbolic framework that makes local systems the perceived arbiter of power); 3) attitudes toward groups and countries adja- cent to but not part of the Roman empire (e.g., treaties or honorific titles given to outsiders); and 4) cultural, social, and economic relations between urban and rural areas. SINOPE AND THE GETO-DACIANS: Steven A. Krebs, Indiana University In the Hellenistic period, Geto-Dacian fortified centers (davae) rose to prominence on the banks of the Danube River and its tributaries. Inscriptions from Histria attest to the pressure native elites exerted on the Greek poleis on the western shore of the Black Sea. Part of the explanation for the emergence of the davae and the native elites must be economic. Greek cities around the Black Sea and the Aegean were trading large quantities of agricultural pro- duce to the Geto-Dacians of the lower Danube basin. The distribution of amphoras bearing the stamps of Greek ex- porters demonstrates the extent of this trade. One of the principal exporters was Sinope, whose amphora-borne produce reached 25 sites in the Dobrogea and many more in the plains beyond the Danube. This far-flung trade network connecting Sinope, the West Pontic poleis, and the Geto-Dacian davae of the lower Danube basin, which had existed since the fourth century B.C., collapsed rather abruptly in the first century B.C. Among the causes may have been the Geto-Dacian king Burebista's prohibition on the consumption of wine and a redirecting of Sinopean trade to Rome. Julius Caesar's founding of a veterans' colony at Sinope in 46 B.C. sig- naled the city's full incorporation into the Roman empire. Using settlement data and the evidence of Sinopean amphora stamps, I outline Sinope's contribution to the de- velopment of the Geto-Dacians and highlight nuances of this relationship. GREEK COLONIES IN COLCHIS IN THE ARCHAIC AND CLASSICAL PERIODS: Otar Lordkipanidze, Institute of Archaeology, Georgian Academy of Sciences The foundation of Greek colonies in Colchis (Phasis, Dioscurias, and Gyenos) by the Milesians during the so-</page><page sequence="41">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 295 called second phase of Ionian colonization (ca. 590-560 B.C.) was dictated chiefly by the desire to exploit and ex- port natural resources (iron, gold, timber, flax, and linseed oil). Finds of Ionian pottery dating to the second half of the sixth century in the territories of local peoples sur- rounding the Greek colonies indicate that the Greeks al- most immediately entered into trade contacts with the local population. Trade with the local population was probably carried out at the markets of the Greek cities (cf. Strabo, 6.4.5; 11.2.3; 12.2.17). At the same time, Greek merchants obviously penetrated deep inland, using not only land routes, but more importantly waterways, elo- quently attested by the distribution of Greek imports. From the sixth to the first half of the fourth century B.C., Greek imports penetrated deep into the region in- land from the Black Sea littoral, including eastern Geor- gia. Finds are known of a black-figure Little-Master cup, for example, and the handles of a fikellura vessel and an Attic black-glazed bowl of the fifth century B.C. from the valleys of the Kur River and its northern tributaries, the Liakhvi and the Prone (Khovle, Avlevi, and Rustavi). These finds were probably brought from the city of Phasis. An East Greek silver phialamesomphalos (fifth century B.C.) with an Aramaic inscription was discovered in the high moun- tain village of Qazbegi. Fragments of Ionian and Attic pot- tery of the sixth and fifth centuries have also been found in southeastern Georgia (Atsquri). BEYOND THE CHORA: GREEKS AND NATIVES IN TRANSCAUCASIAN GEORGIA: Jacques Morin, Bil- kent University In this paper I explore whether the picture of the Helle- nization of Iberia presented by Strabo and in other written sources can be supported by archaeological evidence. Data collected by the Canadian-Georgian excavations (1993- 1997) in southern Georgia are used to evaluate the docu- mentary record; the results of other Georgian research, notably on the acropolis of Mtskheta, the capital of the an- cient kingdom of Iberia, are also discussed. There is little reason to suspect that the presence of the Greeks on the coast had any lasting, or at least visible, im- pact on areas of the hinterland throughout all of pre- Christian antiquity. Any influence was of a limited nature and quite late, no earlier than the Roman principate (per- haps as early as the time of Strabo). Influence is demon- strated, for example, by the presence of a small Roman- type bathhouse on the acropolis of Mtskheta. Influence on the local religion in Colchis, vividly suggested by the finds at Vani, does not appear to have spread further inland, in spite of the literary evidence. Documentary accounts sug- gesting influence are likely the result either of misinter- pretation by classical authors or by much later local Christian writers deeply influenced by contemporary Byz- antine culture and education. The few excavations con- ducted in and around pre-Christian Iberia have pro- duced a limited amount of Greek and Roman material: ceramics and small finds, as well as a few Greek inscrip- tions. Together these prove that contacts existed early on, but do not suggest that they ever developed beyond mere episodic exchanges. CHORAl OF THE GREEK CITIES OF THE NORTHERN BLACK SEA COAST IN THE CLASSICAL AND HEL- LENISTIC PERIODS: SergejJ. Saprykin, Institute of World History, Russian Academy of Sciences On the northern Black Sea coast, military concerns were very important to the organization of chorai. In Olbia, the first organization of the chora belongs to the early sixth-early fifth century B.C. After a short period of devas- tation, it was reinhabited from the early fourth to the mid- third century B.C. The rural area belonged to the city itself and a large part of it was populated by a mixed population of Greeks and locals. The sites of the chora were destroyed by the Scythians and the Sarmatians around the middle of the third century B.C. The chora of Tauric Chersonesos on the Heraclean peninsula was occupied in the mid-fourth century B.C. In the early third century, many farms there went out of use because of raiding by Scythians and/or Sar- matians. Others were fortified against the siege equipment of the Scythians. Despite fortification, repeated destruc- tion phases are known at these sites. In contrast, up until the mid-third century B.C., the Bosporan chora consisted of both polis and royal land, the latter located on the Taman peninsula. From the mid- third century onward, when royal power became stronger, the area of royal land was expanded over the whole Kerch peninsula in the eastern Crimea. During the Mithridatic and post-Mithridatic period, the system of polis lands and royal lands was revived: settlements were converted into ka- toikiai called upon to defend the kingdom and oppose the rebellious Hellenic poleis. This system of land division was maintained into the Roman period. POLIS AND CHORA IN THE PONTUS: SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES: Gocha R. Tsetskhladze, Univer- sity of London There is no evidence concerning the chorai of the first Greek colonies founded in the Black Sea region in the sec- ond half of the seventh century B.C. By the end of the sixth century, most Greek Pontic poleis opened up and estab- lished agricultural territories. Information varies with the extent of study of particular regions. Nevertheless, we can identify similarities and differences between the various Black Sea littorals depending on whether colonies were es- tablished by Ionians or Dorians, with contrasting conse- quences for relations between Greeks and locals. In all areas of the northern Black Sea except Dorian Chersonesos, gradual and peaceful penetration of the hin- terland by the colonists can be inferred. The reduction of the Olbian chora in the fifth century requires further de- tailed study. Histria, in western Pontus, established only a few dozen rural settlements, and evidence points to peace- ful relations with the Getic population. There is no evi- dence concerning settlement on the Bulgarian coast. For Colchis it can be supposed that Dioscuria had its agricul- tural territory, whose population had to defend itself against the locals of the mountainous part. Hostility arose from their habits and practices, not those of the colonists, in contrast with the Chersonesos area, where the hostile nature of the Dorians (observed also at Heraklea Pontica)</page><page sequence="42">296 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 pushed natives far into the hinterland to permit the estab- lishment of a chora. Another feature of the area is the foundation by existing cities (Histria, the Bosporan cities, and Apollonia Pontica) of dependent poleis and emporia on the coast and in the hinterland (e.g., Pistiros and Elizavetovskoe). SESSION 3C: COLLOQUIUM: THE PRODUC- TION OF POWER: ECONOMY AND IDEOL- OGY IN THE MYCENAEAN WORLD COMMODITIES OF IDEOLOGICAL CONTROL: IM- PORTS IN THE MYCENAEAN POLITICAL ECON- OMY: Bryan E. Burns, University of Michigan In this paper I discuss inequality in Mycenaean society in terms of the political economy, exploring the interac- tions of different types and sources of power. Monuments and artifacts function as important instruments in the cre- ation, maintenance, and renegotiation of power relation- ships. The consumption and circulation of imports were part of this discourse in Mycenaean society, since certain materials and symbols were directly connected with poli- tics, force, and belief. Thus, ideological factors, as well as economic ones, directed the production, storage, and dis- play of valued objects. Goods and materials acquired through long-distance exchange were especially suited to manipulation in these power strategies not only because they could be recognized as exotic, but also because access to these resources could be controlled. Semiprecious stones, metals, ivory, and glass were all im- ported into the Aegean as crafted objects and also as mate- rials for Mycenaean workshops. Analysis of these imports demonstrates the role of trade goods as markers of wealth and prestige, and moreover, as active tools of administra- tion, coercion, and ritual. The distribution of imports, taken as an indicator of stability, reflects the range of power dynamics found in different regions of mainland Greece. The production and storage of Mycenaean goods crafted from imported materials reveal the identity and strategies of those competing in the acquisition, crafting, and recycling of exogenous materials. This approach of- fers an expanded view of the Mycenaean power structure, going beyond palatial centers to incorporate local elites who maintained their position in the social hierarchy through economic and ideological means. TEASING OUT THE POWER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PALACE AND THE RELIGIOUS SECTOR OF MYCENAEAN SOCIETY: Susan Lupack, University of Texas at Austin In Mycenaean society the palace elite, with the wanax at their head, clearly held a great deal of economic power through the management of the redistributive system. It is becoming clearer, however, that their economic power was probably not absolute. The religious sector of society may also have wielded some economic influence within the community. The Knossian DI tablets indicate that Potnian workers</page><page sequence="43">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 297 final phase of a craft item's life-its consumption. Artifac- tual, artistic, and textual analysis of textile data is directed by a theoretical model of staple and wealth finance to un- derstand better the ideological role of cloth in the con- struction and maintenance of the Mycenaean social hierar- chy. Since cloth is one of the few commodities that can be considered both a staple and wealth finance item, I exam- ine various types of cloth manufactured under the admin- istration of the palace centers and the use of cloth by Myce- naean elites. As a staple good, textiles were required tribute from outlying areas of the palaces and were probably redistrib- uted within the kingdom. As an item of wealth or prestige, finely woven and elaborately decorated textiles signified status and bestowed authority on subordinate administra- tors, valued exchange partners, and on the Mycenaean elites themselves. Either of linen or wool, the textiles re- corded in the Linear B tablets are described by a variety of epithets, including cloth that "befits the wanax" (wa-na-ka- te-ra), "befits the followers" (e-qe-si-ja), or was "meant for foreigners" (ke-se-nu-wi-ja). Comparing cloth production and consumption at Mycenaean centers with the function of textiles in palatial systems of the eastern Mediterranean, I demonstrate cloth's vital role in disseminating ideology and sustaining power in Mycenaean society. PITHOI IN THE CORRIDORS OF POWER: IDEOLOGY AND ACTIVITY IN THE PALACE OF NESTOR: Sus- anne U. Hofstra, University of Texas at Austin Since Blegen first assigned functions to rooms in the Palace of Nestor, studies have focused on how Mycenaean palatial architecture and decorative programs emphasize the megaron-centered system: the hearth-wanax ideology. These analyses have been based largely on monumental features that "signal" designers' intentions. At the same time, integrated approaches to artifacts, tablets, and architecture have added an understanding of more mundane types of pa- latial activities, modifying Blegen's interpretation-often influenced by Homeric images of kingly residences-and indicating that workshops and specialized storage spaces occupied a significant area; in later periods, the "drawing- in" of activity, and architectural modifications, limited ac- cess to the Main Building's resources. The palaces were not static entities. Behavioral and envi- ronmental studies reveal that a building's users are not merely passive recipients of architectural messages, but re- spond by modifying not only their activities, but their liv- ing and working environment in ways that confound build- ers and decorators: structures, even monumental ones, are not necessarily always used in the way that their designers intended. In this paper I explore how users' behavior re- flected and affected the power of the hearth-wanax ideol- ogy in the Palace of Nestor, and examine, on the basis of an integrated contextual analysis of artifacts, how the in- habitants used (and abused) the building's spaces in its last days. This palace provides an excellent opportunity to learn about the interaction of people and space in a Myce- naean administrative complex, and users' response to its architecture and iconography, as reflected in the remains of their activities. THE IDEOLOGY OF EXCHANGE IN MYCENAEAN ARCHITECTURE OUTSIDE THE PALACE: David R. Scahill, American School of Classical Studies at Athens Architectural units outside the citadel at Mycenae, such as the "Ivory Houses," present an interesting case for the study of exchange and status in Mycenaean society outside of palace structures. Linear B documents and luxury items found within the buildings are suggestive of activities asso- ciated with the palace economy, but no direct association exists between the palace and the houses. I. Tournavitou argues (The "Ivory Houses" at Mycenae [London 1995] 299) that we should view the economic activity within the build- ings as somehow dependent on the central authority of the palace, while she does not rule out the possibility that pri- vate enterprise could have taken place. Whether such houses operated under the economic supervision of the palace or independent merchants, however, the architec- ture and contents nonetheless reflect ideological if not di- rect control by palace administration. Access to material was limited or controlled by the spa- tial arrangement within houses in ways not unlike the pal- ace. The architecture and contents of these lesser build- ings suggest that they express symbolic values of exchange directly related to the larger ideological framework and central authority of the palace. Architectural elaboration such as columns, porches, and courtyards present in some houses but not others, taken with the evidence for distinct building phases, is also examined more closely as a sign of the development of status. This study has implications for our understanding of the role of individuals outside the palace in the control and redistribution of material wealth within the Mycenaean economy. SESSION 3D: ATHENIAN ISSUES DRINKING IN THE ATHENIAN AGO1RA: SYSSITION AND SYMPosloN: Ann Steiner, Franklin and Marshall College A deposit excavated in 1972 in the Athenian Agora (H4:5) has been identified as debris discarded at about 425 from a syssition. A reconsideration of earlier debris from the same eating establishment found in a nearby well (H6:5) expands our picture of public drinking in fifth- century Athens. The graffiti on fragments from Well H6:5 tell us that the pottery was publicly owned and that elite Athenians, including Charmides, who elsewhere is paired with the Glaukon as kalos, were participants. They praise and insult each other in the caustic terms of the symposion. Pottery shapes suggest sympotic activity: fragments of a red-figure neck-amphora, an oinochoe, and black-glaze drinking vessels are preserved in the deposit. Thus, it ap- pears that vessel shapes and dialogue typical of private sym- posia were also part of the syssition. The suggestion that the "bobbin," an object much like a yo-yo, is the iunx, a wheel spun to seduce resistant lovers, is supported by the evidence here: a white-ground bobbin was found with sympotic pottery and graffiti, a convincing context for a mechanical aphrodisiac. In sum, the graffiti</page><page sequence="44">298 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 and bobbin suggest a carryover from private to public drinking behavior. The evidence of "sympotic" pottery pre- serving names of members of the Athenian elite may indi- cate a disjunction: if men used gold and silver at home, they adjusted to clay vessels in public. BLACK-FIGURE, RED-FIGURE, AND COMMUNAL DRINKING IN A LATE ARCHAIC ATHENIAN HOME: Kathleen M. Lynch, University of Virginia In 1994 and 1995, the Athenian Agora excavations re- vealed a household well containing Persian destruction de- bris deposited shortly after 479 B.C. This well provides a rare opportunity to examine the coarse, cooking, and fine wares of a Late Archaic Athenian pottery assemblage from a secure domestic context. One expected use of figured wares-black-figure and red-figure-in the household is for the symposium. My examination of the painted pottery from this well confirms the importance of communal drinking in this home, but also demonstrates that commu- nal drinking was not limited to symposia. Nearly all of the figured wares from this well would be described as "sympotic." A closer look at the assemblage re- veals that the household owned several sets of drinking cups and serving vessels distinguished by technique, shape, size, and date. The sets range from two red-figure cups with intentional red, one if not both by Euphronios, to a set of five red-figure cups of moderate quality, to over 15 black-figure skyphoi of poor quality. The finest pieces in the household, the two cups with intentional red, are also the oldest and bear ancient repairs, while the largest set features hastily rendered stock scenes. The conclusion is that communal drinking in this household occurred in a range of settings: from two drinkers-presumably the owner and an intimate-to a group of 10 or more, and in this particular house, the more intimate the group, the higher the quality of the pottery and the more specific its imagery. THE EXCAVATION OF THE NORTH SLOPE OF THE ACROPOLIS, 1931-1939: Kevin T. Glowacki, Indiana University The excavations on the North Slope of the Athenian Acropolis conducted by Oscar Broneer and the American School of Classical Studies from 1931 to 1939 profoundly influenced the study of the topography and cults of an- cient Athens. The best known of Broneer's discoveries are the Sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite, the underground Mycenaean Fountain, and a series of Archaic wells filled in the early fifth century B.C. Less well known are the results from the later years of excavation, whose study and publi- cation were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. These include the unusual "Skyphos Sanctuary" with a de- posit of more than 200 miniature vessels of the early third century B.C. all turned upside down and placed in rows, and Broneer's limited excavations on the East Slope of the Acropolis, where he discovered part of a marble-paved road of the Roman period leading toward the Theater of Dionysos. This paper uses archival photographs from the collection of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and new plans based upon the original excavation notebooks as a focus for a synoptic overview of Broneer's North Slope excavations, highlighting their contributions to Athenian topography, archaeology, and religion, and clarifying problematic issues and interpretations that have developed in the more than 60 years of research since Broneer began his work in this area. GLASS DEDICATIONS IN CLASSICAL ATHENS: THE EVIDENCE OF THE INVENTORY LISTS: E. Mari- anne Stern, Toledo Society Our knowledge of glass in Classical Greece is based pri- marily on publications of glass objects found during exca- vations and of objects in Greek museums. Colorful core- formed glass bottles dominate the archaeological record. An important source for additional information is the cor- pus of inscriptions detailing the private and public dona- tions housed in the temples and sanctuaries of the Athe- nian Acropolis (S.B. Aleshire, The Athenian Asklepieion, Amsterdam 1989; D. Harris, The Treasures of the Parthenon and Erechtheion, Oxford 1995). The inventories of the Parthenon and the Asklepieion list objects of gold, silver, precious stones, and hyalos, a ma- terial that some scholars identify as rock crystal but that must have been glass because this was the only material known at the time that answered to such disparate descrip- tions as diaphanes (transparent) and poikilos (many col- ored). Dated to exact years in the late fifth and fourth cen- turies B.C., the glass dedications include vessels, gems, miscellaneous items, and even raw glass. Several glass ob- jects are identified by their weight. Combined with existing archaeological evidence, the in- scriptions shed new light on form, function, and apprecia- tion of glass in the Classical period. Perhaps even more im- portant, they raise the intriguing possibility of a native glass industry that specialized in making clear, colorless glass vessels. CELEBRATING DIVINE VICTORY: THE PANATHE- NAIA AT ATHENS: Julia L. Shear, University of Pennsylvania The Panathenaia, held to honor the goddess Athena, was the greatest festival in ancient Athens and conse- quently modern scholars have frequently described it as the goddess's birthday celebration. Our ancient testimo- nia, however, indicate that it commemorated Athena's vic- tory over the Giants (Arist. fr. 637 Rose; schol. Aristid. 3.323 Dindorf). Thus, the Panathenaia was a victory cele- bration, and the invention of the pyrrhiche, a dance in armor, was associated with Athena's own rejoicing after her con- quest of the Giants (Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 7.72.6-7). The important role of the Gigantomachy in the origins of the festival explains why it decorated Athena's peplos and why, from the middle of the sixth century B.C., it appeared re- peatedly in Athenian art and especially on monuments on the Acropolis.</page><page sequence="45">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 299 The Athenian participants at the festival imitated the goddess's rejoicing by performing the pyrrhiche them- selves. They emphasized the military side of the celebra- tion in other contests, such as races of armed men and also of chariots and apobatai, or chariot dismounters, inven- tions attributed to Erichthonios, the human founder of the Panathenaia. Dedications of panoplies by Athenian colonies and allies reinforced the military aition of the fes- tival. That the people of Priene still dedicated a panoply in the second century B.C. attests to the importance and lon- gevity of the Panathenaia's victory theme (I. Priene 45, lines 8-12). The repeated theme of military victory served to unify the entire festival. In the procession, Athenian hop- lites and cavalry passed both monuments attesting to Athe- nian greatness and military success, particularly the Stoa Poikile with its battle paintings and captured shields, and also memorials of past Panathenaic victors. Athena's own military success was imitated and repeated by her people who, in celebrating her victory, commemorated their own. HERMES THE CHISELER: Richard W Johnston, Mil- waukee Society In this paper it is suggested that the marble sculptors of Classical Athens who occupied the small studios and statu- ary shops along a street in the southwest Agora were de- scendants of the Archaic hermoglypheioi (P1. Symp. 215AB), whom Herodotos (2.51) alludes to in religious terms as ed- ucators in the masonic trades. Their unique square herms (Paus. 1.19.2, 4.3.3; Thuc. 6.27), the proverbial tetragonon- type, are seen under the name of Hipparchos (ARV 2.75.59). Simonides (fr. 5 Bergk), a protege of Hipparchos (Arist. Ath. Pol. 18.1), first used "tetragonon" in terms of human perfection, all but suggesting that these Athenian stonecutters may also have been the same individuals who used the chisel as a stylus or pen, writing out the first pub- lic documents of the incipient democracy. Their literacy and use of grammata in apprenticeship perhaps reflects the paideia that benefited even Socrates, sculptor and teacher par excellence. At Hymn to Hermes 41, the poet places a chisel (glypha- non) in the hands of Hermes, as if to suggest that his maieutic was prized by masons for its educational value into the trades, paralleling Hermes' own lyrical career as he soared to new heights and a place among the gods of Olympos. It is suggested that archaeology and literature find new clarity and meaning in the Hymn, which also is concerned with the theme that Hermes' lyre moved stones to build the walls of Thebes (Paus. 9.5.6-8). THE FORM AND FUNCTION OF THE DEXILEOS PRECINCT: Wendy E. Closterman, Johns Hopkins University The funerary precinct containing the well-known Dexi- leos stele, located on the Street of the Tombs in the Ker- ameikos, exhibits an architectural feature unparalleled in other family burial plots-the so-called heroon of Dexi- leos (a structure consisting of a curved wall terminating in antae, which circumscribes the northeast corner of the precinct, and which supported Dexileos's stele). The rea- son why this family burial plot has an unusual form has never been explained. In this paper it is argued that the unique appearance of this burial plot results from two phases of construction that reflect two distinct functions. The "heroon," constructed in 394 B.C. or shortly thereafter, was not part of a family burial plot by original design, but served solely as a com- memorative monument marking the cenotaph of Dexi- leos, who was himself buried in the Demosion Sema. Later, probably in the mid-fourth century B.C., both the function and appearance of the precinct changed; the family of Dexileos transformed the "heroon" into a family burial plot. Only at this time do burials and additional funerary monuments first appear in the precinct. Probably contem- porary with the first burials, the "heroon" was incorpo- rated into a peribolos tomb, the typical form of family burial plots, by extending its north wall to the west. Thus, roughly 40 years after the construction of the "heroon," its architectural setting was modified to conform to the ap- pearance of a peribolos tomb in order to match its new function as a family burial plot. SESSION 3E: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE EAST RECENT EXCAVATIONS AT NEOLITHIC KFAR HAHO- RESH, ISRAEL: Steven E. Kangas, Dartmouth Col- lege, and Nigel Goring-Morris, Hebrew Univer- sity, Jerusalem The recent excavation of Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites in the southern Levant has forced researchers to reconsider widely held notions regarding early agricultural society. The investigation of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Kfar Hahoresh (ca. 9000-8500 B.P.) is yielding significant new information regarding burial practices, the production and use of lime plaster, as well as early art forms. Kfar Hahoresh is a small site located near Nazareth in the Lower Galilee. It was accidentally discovered in 1990. Subsequent investigation confirmed the presence of exten- sive, undisturbed deposits containing large quantities of bones, lithics, and a series of plastered surfaces. Large numbers of human burials, both primary and secondary, have been found beneath all of the plaster surfaces. The number and configuration of bodies vary throughout the site. It is especially interesting that the human remains are often associated with animal bones. In one burial pit a fully articulated but decapitated gazelle was found in asso- ciation with human skeletal remains. Nearby was found a human skull, minus the lower jaw, whose fleshy features had been re-created in plaster and paint in the tradition of Jericho and Ain Ghazal. The close association between hu- mans and animals finds unique expression in the discovery in 1997 of an image of a bovine creature outlined by laying human bones on a bed of ashy sediments. The most recent excavations suggest that the site served the region as a seasonal mortuary center and that the plas- tered surfaces were created as part of the burial ritual.</page><page sequence="46">300 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 EXCAVATIONS AT DOMUZTEPE, TURKEY: AN OVER- VIEW OF THE FIRST FOUR SEASONS OF EXCAVA- TIONS: Elizabeth Carter, University of California, Los Angeles Domuztepe lies in a fertile plain about 35 km southeast of Kahramanmara?, in southeastern Turkey. The site covers an area of around 20 ha and its major occupation dates to the Halaf period, the fifth millennium B.C. (uncorrected) or sixth millennium B.C. (corrected). Domuztepe is un- usual because of its large size, the very restricted nature of its later settlement, and its location on the northwestern frontier of the Halaf cultural horizon. This report summarizes the results of the UCLA-Univer- sity of Manchester excavations over the last four seasons (1995-1998). The presentation highlights the discovery of a large burial pit with at least eight human skulls and a large (nonmatching) number of long bones, and also out- lines briefly the characteristic ceramic, stone vessel, and glyptic assemblages. The ceramics show close links to the Halaf cultures of Greater Mesopotamia; however, a new phase, called Post-Halaf, is now beginning to emerge. Twenty-five stamp seals, including some new types for the Halaf period, indicate the complexity of Halaf society at Domuztepe. The use of obsidian from both eastern and western sources on the Anatolian plateau, shell from the Mediterranean, and Levantine ceramics documents the man- ifold trading networks of the fifth millennium. I conclude by offering some preliminary speculations on the nature of the settlement at Domuztepe and dis- cuss the possible reasons behind its growth in an isolated valley far from the supposed Halaf heartland in Greater Mesopotamia. THE EARLIEST EVIDENCE FOR ROYAL EGYPTIAN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SOUTHERN LEVANT: Eliot Braun, Israel Antiquities Authority Recent excavations in the Soreq Basin of south-central Israel have unearthed a number of villages dating to the period just prior to Dynasty I in Egypt. Two villages of the Early Bronze I horizon have yielded sizable assem- blages of artifacts indicating that the material culture of these sites was primarily local in origin and inspiration. A modicum of artifacts from these sites, however, are im- ported or of Egyptian derivation--either made locally by Egyptians or produced by locals in imitation of Egyptian prototypes. This last category of objects includes two royal Egyptian titularies, serekhs, related to the period of Dynasty 0, prior to the unification of the two crowns under King Narmer. All previously discovered serekhs in the southern Levant have been related to this king (either the last king of Dynasty 0 or the first king of Dynasty I) or later rulers. In this presentation I examine these and other Egyptian- related artifacts and offer suggestions as to how their pres- ence at these sites should be understood. NEO-ASSYRIAN IMPERIALISM IN THEORETICAL PER- SPECTIVE: BradleyJ. Parke University of Utah During the Mesopotamian Iron Age, from about 1000 B.C. to about 600 B.C., the Neo-Assyrian empire was the greatest power the world had yet known. Although sources of information about this once great empire are relatively abundant, few archaeologists have focused their attention on the mechanisms behind Neo-Assyrian imperialism. In recent years I have attempted to combine the vast textual data with archaeological data from recent surveys of the upper Tigris river valley in southeastern Turkey. In doing so several key aspects of Neo-Assyrian imperialism have come to light. The Tigris survey data indicate that the Assyrians established territorial control in some areas through colonization and the construction of networks of fortifications and administrative centers. Social control was imposed in rural villages through the deployment of vast numbers of low-ranking officials called "village managers," who are frequently referred to in Neo-Assyrian letters and administrative documents. In other areas the Assyrians used coercive means to establish hegemonic rule over ex- isting states. In some peripheral regions, the Assyrians con- centrated their empire-building efforts in restricted zones along transportation and communication corridors creat- ing a "network empire" in which large tracts of land around and between Assyrian provinces remained largely outside imperial control. The archaeological and textual data discussed in this paper indicate that the Assyrian authorities maintained a flexible policy toward the implementation of imperialism and that the type of control imposed was dependent on the specific characteristics and circumstances of each region. PASARGADAE REVISITED: TOWARD A NON-HERO- DOTEAN VIEW OF THE BIRTH OF ACHAEMENID PERSIA: David Stronach, University of California, Berkeley Following the conclusion of the excavations of the Brit- ish Institute of Persian Studies at Pasargadae, the capital of Cyrus the Great (559-530 B.C.), in the early 1960s, and following the publication of a final report in 1978, I find I am still not "released" by a number of major issues that go to the heart of the study of early Persian history in the sec- ond quarter of the first millennium B.C. In particular, cer- tain ongoing researches now suggest that Darius the Great (522-486 B.C.), not Cyrus, was the author of the site's so- called Cyrus inscriptions, which define Cyrus as "an Achae- menid." This surprising finding at once obliges us to look beyond the dynastic claims contained in Darius's trilingual Bisitun inscription, and the general acceptance of these claims in Herodotos's Histories, and raises fundamental questions about the true pattern of events that led up to the formation of the first Persian empire. In this context the argument is made that it is time to look again at the ways in which the archaeological evidence from Pasar- gadae, combined with the powerful testimony contained in the text of the famous Cylinder of Cyrus, can be used to chart new lines of inquiry. NEW EXCAVATIONS AT TARSUS: Levent Zoroglu, Selhuk University The American excavations at Tarsus-Gozlfi Kule con- ducted between 1937 and 1939 opened only pre- and pro- tohistoric small settlements; the remains of the famous city of Caesar, Anthony, and Paul lay under the modern town. An underground park project in 1993 brought to light a</page><page sequence="47">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 301 street and colonnade on the western side of the city. This is probably the west portico of ancient Tarsus, with an exca- vated length of ca. 75 m. The street is nearly 7 m wide and is covered with polygonal basalt stones. Water channels on the sides collected rainwater and directed it to the main channel, which is nearly 0.80 m wide and 2.30 m high, placed under the street. On the eastern part of the street is a colonnade on a podium with three steps constructed of local limestone. Shops lined the back, the walls of which had been reused in Late Antiquity. It appears that the street was constructed in the Late Hellenistic period, when the city was under Seleucid domination, and the colon- nade was added in the time of Hadrian. THE 1998 COMBINED CAESAREA EXPEDITION EXCAVATIONS AT CAESAREA MARITIMA, ISRAEL: Martha K. Risser, Trinity College, and Jane DeRose Evans, Temple University King Herod the Great founded Caesarea Maritima at the end of the first century B.C. on the site of an earlier Helle- nistic town named Straton's Tower. A large urban site, Cae- sarea flourished through the Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Crusader periods, until it was destroyed in A.D. 1265. In all periods, Caesarea functioned as a commercial, indus- trial, administrative, and residential center for its hinter- land, and also as a seaport, especially in the centuries after Herod built the artificial harbor adjacent to the city. During the 1998 season, the underwater team of the Combined Caesarea Expeditions continued to explore the ancient harbor, focusing on the morphology of the harbor in order to understand how it changed over time. On land, excavations continued on the Temple Platform at the eastern end of the Inner Harbor, on which are the re- mains of King Herod's Temple to Roma and Augustus. Ex- cavations resumed on the foundations of the temple to un- derstand the structure of the building. We also proceeded with work in area LL, to the north of the Inner Harbor, where Hebrew University excavations in the mid-1970s dis- covered a large corridor-type warehouse, street, and do- mestic quarter. The second story of the warehouse dates to the Byzantine period, with the original building probably dating from Herod's time. The 1998 excavations concen- trated on securely dating the warehouse and exposing more of the Islamic, Byzantine, and perhaps Roman levels of the warehouse, street, and residences in this commer- cial and domestic quarter. THE RETURN OF PROSPERITY? THE ECONOMY OF CAESAREA MARITIMA IN PALESTINE BETWEEN A.D. 70 AND 253: Jane DeRose Evans, Temple University Since Caesarea Maritima became the capital of Pales- tine in 70, one would expect relative prosperity in the city, given the influx of money to pay for troops and govern- mental officials stationed there, and the available loot from the first Revolt. There are indications that Caesarea's economy did not really recover, however, and the city suf- fered in the economic depression that gripped the rest of Palestine. Evidence for economic recovery cannot come from the evidence of coins alone. My study of the coins from the Joint Expeditions to Caesarea Maritima, conducted between 1971 and 1987, provides a basis from which to study the ex- cavation coins of other cities in the province. Together with the evidence of building programs, imported pottery, ancient sources, and evidence from the ancient harbor of Caesarea, a picture begins to emerge of depopulation, de- monetization, and economic depression in the years im- mediately after the first Revolt. A certain degree of recovery occurred after the Bar Kohkba Revolt, as the cities in Palestine benefited from imperial building projects. Yet sometime in the second century the province again suffered from an economic malaise, though the number of coins in Caesarea and com- parative cities actually rose. A real recovery can only be posited during the Severan age, when building programs and ancient sources agree that in spite of the increasing in- flation, Palestine was prospering. By 253, all local mints in Palestine were closed and the province depended on ex- ternal sources for coin. SESSION 3F: CHRISTIANITY IN THE EMPIRE PUPPUT (NEW HYPAEPA): THE EIGHTH CHURCH OF ASIA - THE FIRST CHURCH OF AFRICA: Charles Peirce, Member at Large The seaside archaeological site of Pupput, located some 50 miles southwest of Carthage on the Gulf of Hammamet in Tunisia, is notable for its large collection of enigmatic mosaics covering a span of four centuries. In this paper it is argued that early in the second century A.D., possibly dur- ing the reign of Hadrian, Christians from the site of Hy- paepa near Sardis in Asia Minor settled there, building a community house or domus ecclesiae, which by the sixth cen- tury had expanded to an extensive ecclesiastical complex. The paper focuses largely on the second-century "House of the Triclinium" (A. Ben Abed, La maison du tli- clinium a Pupput, Tunis 1989). The chief evidence for Christian habitation of the site is iconographical, provided by the second-century mosaics of the House of the Triclin- ium. The extensive collection of geometric mosaics can be analyzed as a system of coded references to the identity of the settlers and to their Christianity. For example, in one second-century geometric mosaic, there is a Greek cross composed of eight Latin chi-crosses. This argument is sup- ported by contemporary numismatic, literary, and geo- graphical evidence. If the building is correctly identified as Christian, it would be about a century earlier than any other extant Christian structure in North Africa. URBAN ADAPTATION IN THE TEMPLE-TO-CHURCH CONVERSION AT APHRODISIAS IN CARIA: Laura Hebert, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University The conversion of the Temple of Aphrodite into the ca- thedral of Aphrodisias, executed ca. A.D. 500, presents one of the most structurally ambitious and best-preserved examples of the widespread phenomenon of adapting temples for use as churches. In a manner unique among known examples, the conversion at Aphrodisias basically turned the temple inside out to create a large (ca. 60 x 28</page><page sequence="48">302 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 m) basilica-plan church. The temple's exterior colonnade was rearranged to form the two interior colonnades sepa- rating the church's nave and aisles. The cella walls were dismantled and their blocks reused in the church's exte- rior walls. While the main outlines of the conversion have long been known, I present new evidence for the date of the conversion, a new state plan, and reconstruction draw- ings that show, for the first time, what the cathedral actu- ally looked like in both interior and exterior views. New findings also show how the architects of the conversion in- tegrated the church complex into the city's ancient grid plan, with which its axes are not aligned. In another unique example of urban adaptation, they transformed part of the temenos wall that had surrounded the temple into a monumental columnar gateway in the atrium of the church. This newly created monument not only made for a dramatic entrance, but also set up a new axis that mediated the difference between the main axis of the church and that of the city plan. DATING EARLY CHRISTIAN BASILICAS ON CRETE: THE EVIDENCE OF SCHOOLS OF MOSAICS: Rebecca Sweetman, University of Nottingham As with many Early Christian basilicas, the proposed dat- ing of the some 70 known examples in Crete remains somewhat dubious. Although many of them have been ex- cavated, secure dating evidence is limited to only a couple of basilicas. Previous preliminary work has suggested the existence of a common school of mosaics in Crete and the Peloponnese. With this as a basis, my aim in this paper is to analyze the evidence for schools of mosaics in Crete in the Early Christian period. Through a study of individual geometric motifs and certain combinations of them, I have found evidence for two geographically distinct schools of mosaics on Crete in the Early Christian period. By compar- ing these two groups of mosaics and some of the more ac- curately dated mosaics outside Crete, it is clear that there is also a chronological distinction between the two groups. In this paper I discuss the possibility of using the evidence of these schools to date the mosaics. Subsequently, I com- pare the results of this process to the archaeological, epi- graphic, and numismatic evidence of the basilicas them- selves and propose and test a new chronology for some of the Early Christian basilicas of Crete. THE REIMS CATHEDRAL GROUP PROJECT: RESULTS OF THE 1992-1997 CAMPAIGNS: Walter Berry, Asso- ciation pour les fouilles archeologiques nation- ales, and Robert Neiss, Service r6gional d'archdo- logie, Champagne-Ardenne Severely damaged during the first World War, the 13th- century cathedral of Notre-Dame at Reims was restored during the 1920s and 1930s by the architect Henri De- neux, who also conducted extensive excavations. The lat- ter brought to light what Deneux concluded were three earlier churches. Incomplete and poorly reported at the time, the results of these excavations are known prima- rily through Hans Reinhardt's summary study published in 1963. Under the auspices of the Monuments historiques and the Service r6gional de l'arch6ologie de Champagne- Ardenne, a large-scale archaeological reappraisal of the site became possible as part of the preparations for the cel- ebration of the 1500th anniversary of the baptism of Clovis at Reims in 1996. Work on the site began in 1992 and con- tinued until the end of 1997. The operation involved exca- vation north and south of the cathedral, as well as the re- examination of previously excavated features below the church itself. This paper summarizes the reinterpretation made pos- sible by the recent intervention, and the parallel study of the archives and finds from the excavations of the 1920s. This concerns not only elements belonging to the Late Antique cathedral group (and the discovery of its fifth- century baptistery), but also the major transformations of the Carolingian and Early Gothic periods. In addition, much new information is now available concerning the large Roman-period bath complex that occupied the site from the mid-first to the later fourth century. SESSION 3G: HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE AND PATRONAGE QUEENLY EMULATION IN EARLY HELLENISTIC ARCHITECTURE? Gretchen Umholtz, McMaster University Architectural emulation and rivalry in the Early Helle- nistic Aegean are discussed in this paper, with particular reference to the introduction and dissemination of the boukranion-garland frieze. Strong cases have been made for the existence of distinctive Macedonian and Ptolemaic regional or dynastic architectural styles in the late fourth and early third centuries B.C. The Rotunda dedicated by Arsinoe II and the Propylon dedicated by Ptolemy II in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace have impor- tant stylistic connections to both Macedonian and Ptole- maic architectural spheres. They were influential outside of these spheres as well, particularly in the dissemination of boukranion-rosette and boukranion-garland motifs in monumental architecture. The Temple of Demeter at Pergamon, dedicated (prior to 263 B.C.) by Philetairos and his brother Eumenes on be- half of (V7rEQ) their mother Boa, bore one of the earliest datable examples of the boukranion-garland frieze, almost certainly inspired by Samothracian examples. This temple contrasts with previous Pergamene architectural practice not only in the decoration of its frieze, but also in using marble and the Ionic order. Was the ornamentation of this monument, built on be- half of the matriarch of what would become one of the most important Hellenistic dynasties, chosen in direct em- ulation of the Samothracian dedication of Queen Arsinoe II? Discussion includes a brief review of other examples of early boukranion friezes, a consideration of the signifi- cance of O{ice in dedicatory formulas, and of the role of women in architectural projects of the Hellenistic period.</page><page sequence="49">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 303 BUILDING IDENTITIES: WOMEN AND ARCHITECTURAL PATRONAGE IN EARLY IMPERIAL ROME: Margaret L. Woodhull, University of Texas at Austin The role of women as patrons of monumental architec- ture has received relatively little attention in current litera- ture on women in antiquity. In this paper I argue that elite Roman women of the empire expressed public voices and identities through architectural commissions. Modern schol- ars, following ancient literary sources, attribute to Augus- tus building projects named for imperial women, like the porticoes of Livia and Octavia. Instead, I argue that evi- dence exists for Livia and Octavia themselves having au- thority over these projects. Indeed, I suggest that this evi- dence lies in architectural patronage by elite women outside Rome, looking to the capital for models. Finally, I suggest that in female-authored monuments the viewer finds autobiographical information about the patron that allows one to reinsert her "voice" into ancient history. In the wake of massive urban renewal in Rome, includ- ing the projects of Livia and Octavia, a corresponding rise in architectural patronage by women in other areas of the empire appears. For example, in the Roman colony of Pola, Salvia Postuma Sergia erects the monumental Arch of the Sergii to honor her family. While it ostensibly com- memorates her male relatives, much as Octavia's portico in Rome did for her son Marcellus, Salvia's commission includes biographical information about Salvia herself through inscriptions, a portrait statue, and a personal ge- nealogy. In Salvia's effort we find important parallels with Octavia's and Livia's activities in Rome that provide us with insight into ways that women looking to imperial models could construct their own identities in the Roman world. A REAPPRAISAL OF THE "SEAT OF THE AUGUSTALES" AT OSTIA: Margaret L. Laird, Princeton University In 1941, G. Calza (NSc 19 [1941] 196-215) published the first archaeologically documented "Seat of the August- ales" along the Decumanus to the east of the forum at Ostia (V.vii.5). Calza's argument, that the structure functioned as the meeting place of the freedmen priests of the impe- rial cult, centered on two inscriptions found in the building-a dedication on a statue of A. Livius Chryseros, a sevir Augustalis, and a fragmentary inscription to another sevir Augustalis. Two additional epigraphic fragments asso- ciated with Augustales were excavated in the vicinity. Sculptures found in the building's peristyle were identified as imperial portraits (Sabina, Fausta, and Maxentius) and as priests of the imperial cult. These attributions have been widely accepted. However, information overlooked by, or unavailable to, the publishers of both the building and its sculptural con- tents compromises their association with the seviri August- ales. The presence of two lime kilns directly adjacent to the structure explains the eclectic selection of sculpture, while continued work on imperial iconography calls into ques- tion the attributions of the "imperial" portraits. Further study of the Ostian epigraphic corpus has revealed addi- tional fragments of the inscriptions utilized by Calza, dem- onstrating their sepulchral origins and indicating that they were imported to the area in a later period, either as fod- der for the kilns or as building materials. Other structures used by the Augustales diverge typologically from the Os- tian example, and suggest a different center for the impe- rial cult. A likely candidate is the so-called "Curia," origi- nally associated with the Augustales by Calza and advocated by Meiggs. THE SEPTIZODIUM OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS: A REAP- PRAISAL: Susann S. Lusnia, Intercollegiate Cen- ter for Classical Studies, Rome The Septizodium, generally dated to A.D. 203, was lo- cated at the foot of the Palatine next to the Circus Maxi- mus facing the Via Appia. It was a monument of immense size and architectural richness, but its surviving ruins were destroyed in 1587. Archaeological investigation has re- vealed a portion of its foundations and fragments of its decoration. The Severan Marble Plan, along with Renais- sance drawings and descriptions, provides its general plan and elevation. The Septizodium clearly had a cosmological theme, which can be determined from comparing other known septizodia. Astrology and omens played a significant role in Severus's imperial propaganda. The Septizodium's cos- mological theme conjoined with the dynastic message of Severus, evinced in its inscription and probably also repre- sented in sculpture, projected a powerful image of Severus's ambitions to the people of Rome. To interpret the monu- ment and its role in Severus's dynastic program, however, we must look not only at its decorative themes but also at city planning and the way in which this monument was sit- uated in the urban landscape of Rome. In this context, the current dating of the monument seems wrong. On the basis of a reassessment of the epigraphic evi- dence and the monument's part in Severus's overall urban plan, I propose a new date, A.D. 201, for the Septizodium. Its setting was part of a larger urban plan undertaken by Severus in preparation for his decennalia and triumph in A.D. 202, which included the monumentalization of the Via Appia from the Porta Appia to the Palatine. MITHRAS, HERCULES, AND THE FORUM BOARIUM: CATTLE MARKETS AND CATTLE THIEVES FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE: Alison B. Griffith, University of Canterbury The extant Mithraic temples of Rome are chronologi- cally and spatially dispersed, apparently at random. In this paper I argue that the topographical milieu of the Forum Boarium, rich in mythical and religious traditions, consti- tuted a mise-en-scene for the late third-century mithraeum there. The Mithraic congregation created new symbolic as- sociations byjuxtaposing the bull-slaying sun god, Mithras, with the most ancient Roman deities. In short, these Mith- raists drew a cult long associated with social and geo- graphic periphery into the Forum Boarium, one of the oldest and most venerable parts of Rome. Their efforts aided and were aided by the restored prominence of Her-</page><page sequence="50">304 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 cules, the preeminent god of the place and tutelary deity of the Tetrarchs. The Forum Boarium and the nearby Scalae Caci were toponyms commemorating Hercules' rescue of Geryon's cattle from the cave of Cacus. In their midst, the mith- raeum, lavishly appointed and built into a barrel-vaulted building to imitate the cave where Mithras sacrificed the soteriological bull, echoed these famous topoi of cattle- stealing myth. Mithras and Hercules shared the epithet "invictus," and a dedication to Minerva from the mith- raeum itself reminds us that she, as Helios, assisted in Her- cules' labors. Fundamental aspects of Mithraic belief recall other topoi. Among these were the temples of Ceres and Luna, represented in Mithraic iconography by the sacri- ficed bull from which all plant and animal life ema- nated, and overlooked from the Aventine hill, while Por- tunus's temple and Janus's arch, long associated with crossings, transitions, and the river, spoke to Mithraic belief in metempsychosis. SESSION 4A: AIA/APA JOINT COLLOQUIUM: THE ELECTRONIC STOA: THE FUTURE POTENTIAL (AND PROBLEMS) OF ON- LINE PUBLISHING IN CLASSICS PUBLISHING ELECTRONIC DATA: ARE WE READY? Harrison Eiteljorg, II, Center for the Study of Architecture Materials created by scholars in electronic form-data tables, geographical information system (GIS) files, and computer-assisted design (CAD) models-should logically be distributed in that same electronic form. Paper versions necessarily sacrifice information content, so something is lost in reducing electronic data to paper. Using electronic files, however, requires access to appropriate computer software. Examples are used to illustrate the problems encoun- tered with publication of electronic data. With each of these technologies, significant advantages are available to scholars who create electronic files and to those who use them. The advantages for the latter, however, are depen- dent upon access to appropriate software. If the user has the same software as the data provider, the files can be used easily. If the user has only similar software, it may still be possible to use the files, but only after transferring them from a standard transmission format to the format needed for his or her software. That, of course, means that the user must have some level of sophistication with computers- more, indeed, than most archaeologists currently have. If the user has neither the correct software nor the skills nec- essary to use the files with other software, access to the electronic data is effectively impossible. These problems make it clear that electronic publica- tion must not be undertaken lightly. Projects must be eval- uated carefully to determine when electronic publication is possible; whether publication should be only electronic, only on paper, or both; and, in general, how to distribute information most fully to the largest number of users. How Is A DATABASE NOT LIKE A BOOK? Jocelyn Penny Small, Rutgers University The topics that a book and a database cover may be the same. The time it takes to produce both may be the same. The audience may be the same. The review process and publishers may be the same. But there the similarities stop. A book has a finality, an end to it. A database is rarely fin- ished. A book can be read a hundred years later. A data- base will have died by then, unless it has been carefully nurtured through myriad software and hardware changes over that hundred years. So why use a database at all? It is the ability to find precisely the information you want from enormous sets of data that separates the database from the book. It is the ability to ask kinds of questions that are not feasible from books. These issues and others distinguish- ing books from databases are explored. A NEW CONSORTIUM FOR ELECTRONIC PUBLICA- TION: ADVENTURES IN STOICISM: Ross Scaife, University of Kentucky With the help of a three-year grant from the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education, classicists and classical archaeologists have in 1998 begun a new con- sortium for electronic publication in the humanities. This talk introduces the audience to the project and also pro- vides both an overview of accomplishments and a glimpse at future directions. Our purposes are to foster a new style of refereed schol- arly publications in the humanities not only of interest to specialists but also-and just as importantly-accessible by design and choice of medium to wide public audiences; to develop and refine new models for scholarly collabora- tion via the internet; to help insure the long-term in- teroperability and archival availability of electronic mate- rials; and to support resolutions to copyright and other legal issues as they arise in the course of scholarly elec- tronic publication. This consortium, which we have named "The Stoa," op- erates under the primary direction of the editor-in-chief, who is assisted on general questions of policy by an advi- sory board and supported in detail by editors for particular areas and by ad hoc working groups. The editors fre- quently seek out the advice and opinions of experts in par- ticular fields of specialization. Criteria for editorial review include the quality and importance of the work from a dis- ciplinary perspective, accessibility to wide audiences, and consistency with the technical considerations advanced by this consortium. The Stoa will continuously explore and implement the best available technical practices and solutions to prob- lems in electronic publication as they emerge. Two specific examples include the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and Extensible Markup Language (XML). The DOI not only ensures authentication of content and protection of copy- right, but also provides a flexible yet stable content man- agement and tracking system with constant identifiers for specific content. Moreover, the DOI facilitates a variety of automated cost-recovery strategies. The XML, on the other hand, is designed "to make it easy and straightforward to</page><page sequence="51">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 305 use SGML on the Web: easy to define document types, easy to author and manage SGML-defined documents, and easy to transmit and share them across the Web." Even more to the point, XML has been designed to allow groups of people or organizations to create their own customized markup languages for exchanging information in their domain: classics, archaeology, music, surfing, linguistics, mathematics, history, engineering, rabbit-keeping, etc. COLLABORATIVE, INTERACTIVE CRITICAL TEXTS AND COMMENTARIES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB: THE VERGIL PROJECT AND BEYOND: Joseph Farrell, University of Pennsylvania Even in their printed form, critical texts and commen- taries, two of the most traditional and indispensable tools for studying classical literature, are hypertextual and col- laborative ventures. Every text, every apparatus criticus, and every note is linked with a network of information that sends the reader flipping pages and opening other books in a way with which everyone here is familiar. Furthermore, a comparison of any two texts or commentaries will reveal how truly every commentary is a collaborative venture be- tween the latest commentator and every one of his prede- cessors. The old variorum commentaries, which collected the different opinions of previous commentators into a single corpus, made the derivative character of the com- mentary form more explicit than is usual nowadays, but most commentators, particularly those working on the most intensively studied authors, must be conscious of tak- ing part in a collaborative scholarly effort that extends across the ages. The hypertextual environment of the World Wide Web offers us the opportunity to develop these aspects of tradi- tional scholarly tools far beyond what the printed book al- lows. The Vergil Project represents one effort to create an on-line, interactive, hypertextual, multiauthored text and commentary on the works of an author central to the clas- sical and the humanities curriculum. The project aims to create a critical edition of the works of Vergil in Latin that will be linked to an English translation, information on grammar and syntax, commentary on a range of topics in- cluding textual issues, meter, rhetoric, mythology, geogra- phy, literary models, literary influence, themes, structure, etc. The information will be arranged in such a way as to offer the user commentary appropriate to his or her inter- ests and level of expertise; e.g., it will be possible to consult only commentary on mythology written for a beginner, or only commentary on textual matters suitable for an expert-or vice versa. These materials will be created col- laboratively, first by groups of participants taking part in a pair of NEH-sponsored summer institutes at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998 and 1999, and then by users who will be encouraged to contribute to the commentary as they use it via the web. In my presentation I discuss and demonstrate the mate- rials that the project has created to date and outline plans for future work. The project is meant to be extensible be- yond the study of Vergil; once the main technical obstacles have been overcome, it should be possible to undertake similar projects involving other Latin and Greek authors. Obviously, this vision implies the existence of a set of stan- dards; and for this reason in particular, I describe the rela- tionship between sites like that of the Vergil Project, Per- seus, and VRoma both to one another and to the effort that is underway to establish specific protocols for the pub- lication of scholarly materials such as critical texts and commentaries via the web. At the very least, projects of this sort offer us the possi- bility of maintaining the best features of traditional forms of scholarship while bringing them to a much higher level of utility. Beyond this, they may be instrumental in releas- ing the energy of a much larger, better integrated, and more involved community of scholars than our field has ever before known. THE SUDA ON-LINE PROJECT: Elizabeth Vandiver,; Northwestern University In January of this year, a casual suggestion made over the "Classics" e-mail discussion list led swiftly to the cre- ation of the Suda On-Line (SOL) project, which has as its aim the production of an electronically accessible, anno- tated translation of the entirety of the Suda lexicon. In the few short months of its existence, SOL has grown from a moderately harebrained idea to a serious effort involving dozens of translators, editors, subject-area consultants, and computer programmers from at least six different coun- tries. SOL already has a stable home, a custom-made SGML DTD and a working site where translators can sub- mit their own work via forms for editorial approval. Trans- lators are currently hard at work at over 300 of the more than 30,000 entries in the lexicon. The plan of the project is to assemble an SGML data- base, searchable and browsable on the web, with links to the TLG's Greek text of the Suda and to other electronic resources such as Perseus, Diotima, Website Attica, and Gnomon Online. The editors intend to make translations of individual entries available on the web as quickly as pos- sible, with only the minimum necessary proofreading and editorial oversight. A diverse board of area specialists will eventually edit every entry, altering the content as needed and adding annotations, links, and bibliography. The dis- play of each entry will include an indication of the level of critical scrutiny it has received. This plan is designed to en- courage the greatest possible participation in the project and the smallest possible delay in presenting a usable re- source to the public. The goal of SOL is not just to be a useful tool for re- searchers, but to serve as an example of a new paradigm of scholarship made possible by computer technology and the internet, one that is cooperative rather than solitary, communal rather than proprietary, worldwide rather than localized, and evolving rather than static. We anticipate that as SOL progresses it will provide proof of how elec- tronic media can be used to take advantage of an enor- mous reservoir of untapped creativity in the scholarly com- munity. In this paper, I sketch the history of the SOL project and discuss its current state and future plans. Mem- bers of the audience are invited and encouraged to be- come participants in the project.</page><page sequence="52">306 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ENCOURAGING COLLABORATION: ON-LINE PUBLI- CATION OF MEDITERRANEAN POTTERY: Sebas- tian F.S.

It is currently available on the internet at http://antaeus.holycross.edu/rmp/. RMP is a preliminary effort to make ceramic data accessible to both specialist and nonspecialist audiences in a manner that promotes cross-project analyses of economic and cultural phenom- ena in the ancient Mediterranean. As such, it raises issues that will become prominent as more electronic publica- tions become available. Central to RMP is a flexible and uncomplicated representation of archaeological ceramics that describes finds from many different projects- projects that have used diverse methodologies for collec- tion and varied standards for recording ceramic data. This representation is one starting point for discussing the ex- tent to which on-line publication can encourage the cre- ation of cross-project databases without attempting to en- force arbitrary standards that do not satisfy the needs of any single project in particular. As a web site, RMP exists as a set of interactive queries that determine how the database can be used, a fact that emphasizes that on-line publication requires as much at- tention to functionality as it does to content. This is partic- ularly true of a database such as RMP, which should allow users to explore questions that the author or authors may not have considered. The issue of RMP's audience leads to the last topic discussed: the possibility of interfaces to on- line resources being defined by the user. Ways of accessing a database can proliferate in an attempt to accommodate users who range from specialists interested in specific sherds to less-focused audiences looking for Mediterra- nean-wide distribution maps. RMP allows user-initiated customization of that which functionally is available so that flexibility does not come at the cost of unreason- able complexity. SESSION 4B: COLLOQUIUM: URBANISM OF WESTERN ASIA MINOR: THE CURRENT STATUS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH THE FOUNDING OF PERGE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HELLENISTIC THROUGH ROMAN PERIODS: Halik Abbasoglu, Istanbul University Ka-as-ta-ra-ia and Par-ha-a, mentioned on a tablet from Hattusa, have a link with Perge on the Kestros River. Our excavations yielded graves and pottery indicating that oc- cupation occurred on the acropolis of Perge in the third to second millennia B.C., although there is not yet archaeo- logical evidence for the Parha/Perge phase referred to on the tablet. The ktistes names in the inscriptions imply an immigration following the Trojan War. Around 700 B.C., Greek colonization occurred, and structures on the acrop- olis testify to the development of an autonomous city. In the Hellenistic period, when Perge flourished, the lower city took shape-a process manifested in the con- struction of city walls and the main gate with its round de- fensive towers. Our soundings, following upon observa- tions by A. Mansel and H. Lauter, confirmed that the gateway had three building phases, dated to the Hellenis- tic, Early Roman, and Imperial Roman periods. Other well- preserved monuments survive from Imperial Roman times, the most glorious era in the city's history, when it expanded southward. Excavations of the public baths in this area show that they underwent three phases of construction. A final prosperity came in the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods, when both the lower city and the acrop- olis were inhabited. Clear evidence for this comes from the basilicas constructed on the acropolis and from similar structures and peristyle houses located in the lower city. Studies of the architecture and small finds indicate that the peristyle houses lasted from the third to sixth centu- ries A.D. THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT OF PERGAMON: Wolf- gang Radt, Deutsches Archdiologisches Insiti- tut, Istanbul Recent excavation at Pergamon by W. Radt uncovered a fortification wall surrounding quite a large settlement that existed on the southern slope of the Pergamon hill from the seventh to fifth centuries B.C. The wall consisted of rough boulders and had a gate of the overlap type. Datable ceramic sherds appeared, but there remained no walls of houses. After a period of abandonment in the fourth cen- tury B.C., the city had a new founding under the dynast Philetairos (281-263 B.C.), displaying a regular grid of narrow streets and deep sewer channels cut into the rock below. The circuit wall closely followed the line of the Ar- chaic wall and featured good ashlar masonry. The next enlargement of the city occurred under Eumenes II (197-159 B.C.) and established new quarters outside Philetairos's older town. The new street grid was very regular and had a different orientation from the pre- vious one. A third extension of the city, directed toward the plain at the base of the hill of Pergamon, took place during the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan (A.D. 98- 117). The city grew to more than twice its earlier size, and its grid-shaped plan was aligned with the Temple of Trajan on top of the acropolis. Large Roman buildings preserved from this period, such as the Red Hall, clearly reflect the latest street system. During the Late Antique and Early Byzantine periods, the city once again confined itself to the hill, hiding behind newly built fortifications, one belonging to each period. THE HISTORICAL TOPOGRAPHY OF EPHESOS: Peter Scherrer, Osterreichisches Archiiologisches Insti- tut, Vienna Recent excavations have clarified several aspects of the urban development of Ephesos after ca. 300 B.C., when Lysimachos moved the city's center. We now understand much better the Hellenistic phase of Ephesos, especially in the commercial agora, whose earliest major structures have come to light along with successive rebuilding and monumentalization of this space (explored by P. Scher-</page><page sequence="53">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 307 rer). The lines of city walls and the receding coastline have appeared through surveys and geological soundings made in 1995 and 1997. Other excavation has demonstrated how the shape of Ephesos changed under Augustus and evolved with the Julio-Claudian emperors after an earthquake in A.D. 23. Most important were the creation of a new political center in the upper city and the establishment of new sites for the theater and stadium outside the Hellenistic walls near the coast. From the time of Domitian to Antoninus Pius, urban expansion reached a peak through the construction of ternples of the Imperial cult, a new harbor, and three large bath-gymnasium complexes with aqueducts. The city's wealth also appears in the luxurious terrace houses in the central zone-structures that recently have received much scholarly attention. Current research also has confirmed that the earth- quake of A.D. 262 devastated Ephesos, and that the city did not recover before the late fourth century. With the advent of Christianity, many new buildings appeared, including a cathedral, the so-called Church of Mary, recently reinvesti- gated by S. Karwiese. Several other existing structures ac- quired new functions. PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGORA AT APHRODISIAS: Christopher Ratte, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Recent discoveries have shown that Aphrodisias ac- quired a grid plan in the second or first century B.C. At the center of this plan lay the Agora, a large public square sim- ilar in conception to the Civic (or Upper) Agora of Ephe- sos. The development of this city square mirrors the chang- ing fortunes of Aphrodisias from the Late Hellenistic to the Late Roman period. Of special interest is the north side of the square. The double-colonnaded stoa that runs the full width of the square bears a dedication by C. Julius Zoilos, a prominent citizen of the late first century B.C. The Bouleuterion cen- tered on the north side of the square is a structure of the mid- or later second century A.D., probably replacing an earlier building on the same site. Two over-life-size portrait statues of a woman and her uncle set up in the north stoa of the Agora in front of the Bouleuterion are probably as- sociated with this renovation. West of the Bouleuterion lies a large Late Roman peristyle house, the so-called "Bishop's Palace." Like the Bouleuterion, this structure may replace an earlier building on the same site, perhaps, as P. Gros has suggested (in Aphrodisias Papers 3 [1996] 111-20), the Pry- taneion. A pair of portraits of Imperial officials set up in the stoa in front of the house attest to its continued use as a public building in the Late Roman period. HIERAPOLIS OF PHRYGIA: ITS EVOLUTION IN HEL- LENISTIC AND ROMAN TIMES: Francesco D'Andria, Universiti degli Studi di Lecce The urban layout of Hierapolis extends over a large cal- careous plateau, situated 350 masl and overlooking the broad valley of the Lykos River. Of the original Hellenistic phase of the city, dating from the beginning of the second century B.C., there remains sparse evidence in the necrop- olis, in the form of inscriptions and tumulus tombs, and perhaps also in the urban plan. The city's definitive layout occurred in the Flavian period, with the reconstruction following an earthquake in A.D. 60. Hierapolis was orga- nized along a spacious north-south avenue (plateia) 13 m wide. The various buildings facing onto the principal street share a continuous travertine facade of Doric de- sign. The street's two entrances have monumental gates with triple arches, flanked by towers that bear dedicatory inscriptions of the Proconsul of Asia, Sextus Julius Fronti- nus (A.D. 86). Recent excavations by F. D'Andria and H. Baysal have clarified the development of Hierapolis during the sec- ond century A.D., when the city enjoyed continuous growth. This included the construction of a monumental agora with Ionic porticoes and a stoa-basilica decorated with extraordinary figural capitals that depict lions and sphinxes. To the same period also belong the theater, two sets of public baths, the Sanctuary of Apollo, and a necropolis. One of the latest Roman monuments is the Nymphaeum of the Tritons, attributed by an inscription to Alexander Severus and featuring a rectangular basin 70 m long, as well as a marble relief frieze representing the Amazonomachy. THE CITY OF XANTHOS FROM HELLENISTIC TIMES TO THE EARLY BYZANTINE ERA: Jacques des Courtils, Universite de Bordeaux III-Michel de Montaigne Xanthos is the only Lycian city whose excavation has re- vealed the principal stages of its development. Current research aims to clarify the city's archaeological topogra- phy and to distinguish indigenous features from Helleniz- ing ones. The Lycian acropolis and its rampart formed the city's nucleus in the Archaic and Classical periods, and it was believed that only in Roman times did the city achieve its present size, marked by a large fortification wall. We must now revise that view, for current investigation of the circuit wall by J. des Courtils and T. Marksteiner has shown that it already attained its maximum extent in the Classical period. The recent discovery of the remains of Classical and Hellenistic houses outside the original acropolis demon- strates that by that time Xanthos was a city of large scale, and that an internal rampart separated the acropolis from the rest of the city, as in other Lycian towns. The lo- cation of tombs and city gates also allows us to determine the principal urban axes. More unusual is the rarity of re- ligious monuments in the excavated areas. Finally, cur- rent studies of the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine levels have caused revisions in our understanding of ur- ban development in these periods. It seems that Xanthos underwent a complete transformation in the Late Em- pire, with a series of gates marking city squares and axes in the plan. In the Early Byzantine era, there occurred a concentration of domestic buildings and the construc- tion of several churches, enriching our picture of the city's latest phase.</page><page sequence="54">308 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 SESSION 4C: ASPECTS OF PREHISTORIC PRODUCTION AND ECONOMY MILLSTONES AND CEREAL PROCESSING AT NEO- LITHIC FRANCHTHI: Anna Stroulia, Indiana University Excavations conducted (1967-1976) at the site of Franchthi, in the southeastern Peloponnese, Greece, un- covered a plethora of cultural and environmental remains in a sequence of deposits extending from the Upper Palae- olithic through the end of the Neolithic period. Among these remains is a substantial collection of around 750 ground stone tools from all phases of the Neolithic. Inter- estingly enough, very few of these tools can be identified on the basis of their shape, size, raw material, and use wear as millstones used for processing cereal grains. Even more interesting, all of these millstones seem to date to the Early and Middle Neolithic. Franchthi palaeobotanical evidence, nevertheless, confirms the consumption of cereals through- out the Neolithic. How can the absence of cereal-processing millstones from the Late and Final Neolithic record be explained? Is this the result of excavation sampling? Does it reflect changes in economic or cultural strategies or even changes in the populations occupying Franchthi? Could cereal- processing techniques not involving millstones have been used by the inhabitants of Franchthi in the later phases of the Neolithic? I explore these questions in light of evidence coming from other kinds of ground stone tools and artifacts such as ceramics and chipped stone tools. Moreover, I examine the chronological distribution of cereal-processing mill- stones at other Neolithic sites of southern Greece in order to detect possible similarities in patterning and place Franchthi cereal-processing in its regional context. BRONZE AGE CHIPPED-STONE TOOLS FROM EXCA- VATED CONTEXTS IN THE ARGOLID: AN ALTERNA- TIVE PATTERN: James M.L. Newhard, University of Cincinnati Current discussions regarding the production and dis- tribution patterns of chipped stone tools in the Greek Bronze Age have relied upon data derived from surface surveys, specifically those in the southern Argolid (the Ar- golid Exploration Project) and Messenia (the Pylos Re- gional Archaeological Project). Research indicates that within each region a particular site near the sea had a sig- nificantly higher proportion of obsidian debris in compar- ison to the surrounding sites. These findings have led scholars to conclude that obsidian was being processed at one specific site before being distributed to the surround- ing settlements. This "central processing" theory has been suggested as the primary manner in which obsidian was transported onto the mainland. My analysis of chipped stone from the sites of Tiryns and Midea, combined with published data from Lerna, suggests that settlements in the central Argolid were manu- facturing their own tools, as opposed to relying upon a centralized location. Since chipped stone is primarily utili- tarian, this material gives us evidence of local relationships at the most functional level. This decentralized pattern suggests that a higher level of self-sufficiency was occurring in the Argolid than in other regions. THE DYNAMIC OF THE NORTH AND EAST AEGEAN ISLAND SOCIETIES DURING THE THIRD MILLEN- NIUM B.C.: TOWARD A REASSESSMENT OF THE "TROJAN CULTURE": Ourania Kouka, Foundation of the Hellenic World Since Schliemann's excavations, Troy represents the be- ginning of Aegean archaeology and serves as a reference point for studies related to chronology, architecture, ce- ramics, small finds, and technology. The similarities of the material culture of the Early Bronze Age island settlements on Lemnos, Lesbos, Chios, and Samos to that of Troy led to the designation of this culture as the "Trojan Culture." My study focuses on the settlement organization of Troy, Poliochni, Thermi, Emporio, and Heraion and analyzes three aspects of each habitation phase: architecture (plan- ning, buildings, interior equipment); economic activity and craft specialization; and function of the architectural units and distribution of special economic activities within the settlements. The results of my research, in association with those of recent excavations at Troy, Limantepe, Baklatepe, Lemnos, Samothrace, Thasos, and Skyros, indicate the existence of a cultural koine and point to increasing competition be- tween the urban settlements of the northeast Aegean is- lands and those of the Asia Minor littoral, as well as among the island societies, visible in Thermi V, Poliochni Green, and Troy I-late. This competition becomes pronounced in the second half of the third millennium B.C. in major urban centers like Poliochni Yellow, Troy II-late, and Limantepe. Since Troy II, wealthy because of trade but conservative in terms of local material culture, had Poliochni (Green- Yellow) as a great competitor in maritime trade and was not the only fortified settlement on the western coast of Asia Minor, I propose the introduction of the term "North and East Aegean Culture," suitable for both the island soci- eties and the littoral settlements of western Asia Minor. I limit the use of the term "Trojan Culture" to the local socio- political phenomenon of Troy II. EXPLORATION IN THE LARNACA HINTERLAND, CYPRUS, 1998: Albert Leonard, Jr., University of Arizona The Larnaca Hinterlands Project is a multiseason project designed to elucidate the social, political, and cul- tural relationship(s) of the Late Bronze Age sites in the land behind Larnaca, especially the association between the two great coastal emporia (Kition and Hala Sultan Tekke), and the group of wealthy, intermediate sites (Klav-</page><page sequence="55">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 309 dhia, Arpera, Kivisili, Aradhippou, etc.) situated approxi- mately on the 100-m contour, midway between the ports and the copper/timber rich regions further inland. The cemeteries of these sites, most excavated during the last century, were exceedingly rich in imported Aegean pottery and other prestige goods, indicating their integral role in the Aegeo-Cypriot commerce of the Late Bronze Age. The 1998 season, funded by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory, was centered on the site of Arpera (Aghios An- dronicos) and included the salvage excavation of a dis- turbed LBA tomb (first recorded in 1997), and the conven- tional excavation of what appears to be the associated settlement, complete with evidence for copper smelting in the vicinity. Intensive, pedestrian survey in the vicinity of the chapel of Aghios Andronicos suggested sustained (?) human presence in this area since the Early Bronze Age. More extensive survey, designed to define the economic "catchment" of the site, was also conducted in order to fa- cilitate the formulation of a model that would help to define the relationship of the intermediate sites with each other, as well as the role that they played in the trade between the resource-rich hinterland, the large coastal emporia, and the important international markets that they served. THE BALANCE WEIGHTS FROM THE LATE BRONZE AGE SHIPWRECK AT ULUBURUN: Cemal Pulak, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas A&amp;M University The Institute of Nautical Archaeology's excavation of a Late Bronze Age (1300 B.C.) shipwreck at Uluburun, near Ka? in southern Turkey, revealed one of the wealthiest as- semblages of trade goods found in the Mediterranean. The ship's cargo, perhaps a royal one, comprised mostly raw materials in the form of copper and tin ingots, but manufactured goods were also represented. The 149 balance weights from the site comprise one of the largest and most complete collections of contempora- neous weights from the Bronze Age. Because every ancient merchant probably carried his own set(s) of weights, which would have been needed for conducting commercial transactions in port, this unique assemblage affords a rare glimpse into the world of seafaring merchants and their weights, weight sets, and balances. Subjecting the well- preserved weights to a statistical analysis by quantal meth- ods revealed, for the great majority of weights, a standard whose unit mass is ca. 9.3 g. The same statistical analysis also suggests the presence of at least two additional stan- dards of lesser importance, with unit masses of ca. 7.4 g and ca. 8.3 g. These weight sets and the standards they incorporate may be taken as near-conclusive evidence that Semitic mer- chants were aboard the Uluburun ship. The absence of weights based on the Aegean mass standard, however, is puzzling if at least two Mycenaeans were accompanying the venture, as suggested by the pairs of Mycenaean personal possessions recovered. Perhaps these Mycenaeans were merely envoys charged with escorting, presumably to a Mycenaean port, the goods on the Uluburun ship. SESSION 4D: CLASSICAL GREECE AND CRETE THE EXCAVATION IN 1997 OF THE SANCTUARY OF AGIOS ELIAS IN ASEA, ARCADIA: Jeannette Forsen, Swedish Institute at Athens, Bjorn Forsin, Finn- ish Institute at Athens, and Erik Ostby, Norwe- gian Institute at Athens The sanctuary of Agios Elias in Asea, Arcadia, was exca- vated in 1997 by a Nordic team under the auspices of the Swedish Institute at Athens. Only some preliminary sound- ings had previously been made at the site in the late 1930s by the Swedish scholar Erik Holmberg. The aims of the ex- cavation were many: to establish if some cult activity existed at the site prior to the building of the Late Archaic temple around 500 B.C., to find the altar of the temple, to form a more accurate idea of the temple construction, to deter- mine the identity of the deity worshipped there, and fi- nally, to establish when the temple was destroyed. Through the four-week excavation campaign we found answers to most, but not all, of our questions. Now we know that some cult activity took place at the site at least 400 years before the construction of the Late Archaic temple. The earliest pottery found has been dated to the LH and Protogeometric periods. In the pottery repertoire we see both Corinthian and Laconian imports. An ash altar was found about 10 m northeast of the tem- ple entrance. The altar was only partly excavated due to time restrictions; nevertheless, large quantities of votive of- ferings, e.g., bronze, iron, lead, bone, and terracotta arti- facts, and the remains of at least 80 individual sheep or goats offered to the deity were found. The temple was pos- sibly destroyed in the late fourth or early fifth century A.D., as suggested by a coin found in the destruction layer. THE MINIATURE VOTIVE VESSELS FROM THE NOR- WEGIAN EXCAVATIONS AT TEGEA: Leslie Ham- mond, University of Missouri-Columbia The Norwegian Institute at Athens conducted excava- tions at Tegea from 1990 to 1994, concentrating efforts within the Classical Temple of Athena Alea and the area to its north. Investigations confirmed the existence of an Ar- chaic temple and two Geometric apsidal structures be- neath the Classical cella, while a metalworking area and a bothros were uncovered in the pronaos. The area to the north of the Skopaic structure yielded remains ranging in date from Archaic through Byzantine. Miniature vessels figured predominately among the numerous finds during this campaign. Miniature votive vessels are ubiquitous components of sanctuaries and cult places throughout the ancient world. While few will question their cultic signifi- cance, fewer still have undertaken the task of processing the mass of material these objects encompass. In this paper I discuss the miniature votive vessels un- covered at Tegea by the Norwegian expedition, presenting them by locus, specifically from beneath the pronaos and cella of the Classical Temple of Athena Alea and the area to its north. The vessels from these regions are quite dis-</page><page sequence="56">310 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 tinct from one another. These differences are evident among the shapes, wares, and decoration of the miniature vessels that were found within the two apsidal buildings, in the metalworking area, and in the sector to the north. These different characteristics are radically apparent, how- ever, among the miniatures found in the bothros. The di- versification of attributes among these vessels emphasizes their function in relationship to the areas in which they were found. The chronological change in the types of min- iature vessels corresponds to the differences illustrated among the other votives, indicating a change in ritual ac- tivities. Improved understanding of these miniature votive vessels, present in nearly all cultic contexts, will enhance our interpretation of religious practices. CORINTHIAN PRODUCTS AT ARCADIAN STYMPHA- LOS: A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE VOTIVE TERRACOTTAS FROM THE ACROPOLIS TEMPLE: Kathleen Donahue Sherwood, Montreal Society The ancient city of Stymphalos is located in the moun- tains of Arcadia, an area little known archaeologically until recently. An international team under Canadian direction is currently reexamining selected aspects of the ancient city. The terracotta figurines discovered at the site, with a few exceptions, come from the acropolis area where they were found in association with a small stone temple, an al- tar to the east, and an auxiliary rectangular building to the northeast. The temple is tentatively identified as that of Athena Polias on the basis of a boundary stone found in the vicinity by Orlandos during excavations there earlier in this century. The terracotta figurines, about 175 in number, range in date from the fifth to the late first century B.C. and fall into two distinct groups. The first and oldest group of gen- erally small, plaquelike votive offerings is comparable in both clay and type to material from the so-called "Potters' Quarters" at Corinth, and was imported to the site to serve the votive needs of the population. At Corinth, as at Stymphalos, despite the Late Archaic style, the figurines are found in contexts of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. and their manufacture is dated to that period-evidence of conscious archaizing of votive offerings dedicated at the site. The second group dates primarily from the fourth- second centuries B.C., displaying a wide variety of styles and sizes. Among these fragmentary examples are some large-scale pieces that are similar to unpublished examples of fourth-century peplophoroi, massive in scale and sculp- tural in concept, reflecting the tradition of large-scale ter- racotta sculpture at Corinth. Others are more delicate in scale and execution, but also sculptural in style; one partic- ularly fine example shows an enthroned female with gilded sandal perched on the edge of a footstool, her in- formal pose reminiscent of the Tyche of Antioch. As we await the publication of Merker's comprehensive study of terracotta production at Corinth, the figures from this sec- ond group expand our knowledge of the products of Corinthian coroplasts in the Hellenistic period. The aim of this paper is to present the chronological, stylistic, and typological range of figurines from the acrop- olis site, to make some preliminary observations about a single facet of votive deposition in the Arcadian hinter- land, and to examine the influence of the important coastal city of Corinth on votive dedications in the ancient city of Stymphalos. ROCK-CUT INSCRIPTIONS, "THE RESIDENTS," AND THE TWO-DEME ORGANIZATION OF ATTICA: Nicholas F Jones, University of Pittsburgh Membership in the demes of Athens was hereditary, with the consequence that citizens who relocated outside the ancestral center retained their original aaffiliations. Thus, the members of the deme Marathon may eventually be found residing not only in Marathon itself but also in Athens and elsewhere in Attica. This, the familiar "consti- tutional" deme, over time experienced a steady loosening of its territorial cohesion. Rock-cut inscriptions from various locales in Attica pub- lished by Traill and others suggest strongly, however, that the deme was also defined by precise territorial bound- aries. This inference is supported by epigraphic texts local- izing properties with reference to a deme, by the taxation of land by deme, and by the practice of identifying metics as "residing in" a particular deme. This last mentioned phrase prompts a new analysis of the formulation "the res- idents" occurring in epigraphic texts from Ikarion, Eleusis, and Rhamnous. I suggest that these words too have refer- ence to the territorial boundaries of these, and inferen- tially of all, Attic demes. Among the implications of the "two-deme" model worked out in my forthcoming Associations of Classical Ath- ens (Oxford), the territorial deme, in contrast to its "consti- tutional" counterpart, embraced not only resident demes- men but resident nondemesmen, metics, and perhaps slaves as well. Thus, for the first time we can understand how the great mass of disfranchised individuals, legally de- barred from participation in governmental institutions, were nonetheless included in the public life of Athens. "THIS ISLAND KYKLAS": THE CYCLADES UNDER THE SECOND ATHENIAN LEAGUE: Brian Rutishauser Ohio State University For most periods in antiquity, the Cyclades have been characterized as backwaters by modern scholarship. The period of the Second Athenian League (378-338 B.C.), however, may have been an exception. Epigraphic and lit- erary evidence from the period indicates that the League was an organization that the poleis of the Cyclades turned to their political and economic advantage. These islands had strategically important locations along Aegean ship- ping routes, and their membership in the League allowed them to enjoy the protection of the Athenian navy. Several of the islands had local commercial products, such as the marble of Paros or ruddle from Keos, and there is evidence that these were exported throughout the period of the League. Naxos and Siphnos produced local coinages that facilitated exchange between weight standards used both on the Greek mainland as well as Asia Minor. The temple</page><page sequence="57">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 311 treasury of Delos, which was under Athenian control in this period, allowed the debts of several islands to remain in arrears during the time of the League. The evidence of recent survey work on Keos, Naxos, and Amorgos shows a high level of agricultural exploitation during this time, and there is epigraphic evidence from Keos and Tenos of a rel- atively large number of landowners on these islands. The prosperity of these islands may also have been the result of conscious policy, as the islands recognized the advantages of League membership, and Athens saw the importance of favorable economic conditions to the continued loyalty of her allies. URBAN PLANNING AND ARISTOPHANES: A NEW NOTE ON Av. 995-1009: Etta M. Saunders, Uni- versity of Maryland In Av. 995-1009, Aristophanes paints a humorous tab- leau of the mathematician Meton as he instructs the inhab- itants of Cloudcuckooland on the fine art of laying out a city. He measures and draws various lines, and inscribes a circle; the end result is an image that looks to his audience much like a circular star with radiating lines. The instru- ments used by Meton and the resulting "radiating" plan have long been a source of discussion for scholars of both Aristophanes and Greek urban planning. In this paper I ex- amine these issues in the context of ancient urban planning. Aristophanes' account goes beyond a simple lampoon- ing of Meton or its modern misinterpretation of the construction of a traditional, radiating city plan. A new understanding emerges when this passage is read in the context of other ancient theoreticians such as Vitruvius, Aristotle, and Thales. Meton's "radiating" plan, which "squares the circle," is closely related to the issues of site condition and wind direction, subjects that were of genu- ine concern to Greek and Roman surveyors. These and other sources record in theory and on paper actual urban design practices. Although they were first written down in the fourth century B.C., they were based on a rich tradition that had existed as early as the eighth century as illustrated by the orthogonally planned cities of Magna Graecia and Sicily. I show here how Aristophanes embedded invaluable information on ancient surveying instruments and urban planning in the mathematician's nonsensical jargon. CYDONIA AND WESTERN CRETE IN THE SIXTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES B.C.: Brice L. Erickson, Univer- sity of Texas at Austin The sixth and fifth centuries on Crete are a poorly un- derstood part of the island's history. Crete receives only passing notice in the ancient literary sources. Archaeolo- gists, for their part, have reported mysterious gaps in the material record, involving a near-absence of finds dating between ca. 600 and 400 B.C. Most of the sites where these gaps occur belong to a single geographical region (central Crete), but this factor has not curtailed speculation that the whole island may have suffered from a general decline of catastrophic proportions. Historians have rarely consulted the evidence from west- ern Crete. This is unfortunate because literary and archae- ological sources for Cydonia, one of the region's chief cities, are relatively plentiful during the period in ques- tion. The testimony of Herodotos (3.59) and Thucydides (2.85) relating to the city's historical foundation and its ex- ternal relations can be supplemented with a composite of archaeological sources combining epigraphical and nu- mismatic evidence with the excavations of burials and rural sanctuaries. The resulting picture is one of a region thriv- ing thanks to its trade connections with mainland Greece and a tradition of Aeginetan involvement in the area. West- ern Crete does seem, however, to experience a temporary recession in the second half of the fifth century, a conse- quence, I suggest, of severed trade relations following the first Peloponnesian War and the ascendancy of Athens in the Aegean. SESSION 4E: ROMAN ARCHITECTURE AND TOPOGRAPHY EXPLAINING THE ORIGIN OF THE ROMAN BASILICA: EARLY BASILICAS AND THE GRAECOSTASIS: Katherine Welch, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University In this paper I attempt to solve the riddle of the origin of the basilica, one of the most distinctively Roman and ar- chitecturally influential of ancient building types. I argue that the basilica was conceived in the late third/early sec- ond century B.C. for a specific location (the northwest cor- ner of the Forum Romanum), and with a particular audi- ence in mind (ambassadors of the Hellenistic kings). Topographical considerations, a passage in Vitruvius (6.3.9), and analogies with early basilicas at Cosa and Alba Fucens suggest that the first attested basilica, the Basilica Porcia of 184 B.C., had much in common-similar pro- portions and freestanding columns running along the walls-with the oecus of Hellenistic palaces and mansions (e.g., the "Palazzo delle Colonne" in Ptolemais). The rea- son for the similarity is that the earliest basilicas (the Basil- ica Porcia and a possibly earlier basilica, Plaut. Curc. 472) were conceived with an ambassadorial audience in mind: indeed, the Basilica Porcia was located very close to the Graecostasis, where ambassadors of Hellenistic kings pre- sented themselves before entering the adjacent senate house. The first Roman basilicas, then, were designed not just as places of business, but to reassure Greeks of Roman cultural sophistication and to provide them with a familiar and welcoming space in a forum that at that time was still surrounded by Italic-style houses of the Roman elite. That the basilica was conceived for an audience that repre- sented royal power solves two mysteries: why the Basilica Porcia was said to have been built against senatorial oppo- sition (Plut. Cato 19.2); and why the word basilica ("kingly") was chosen for the building type. How NORMAL IS NORMAL? THE "NORMAL" BASILICA OF VITRUVIUS: Paul D. Scotton, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania During the past three decades, scholarship and archae- ological findings have led to a revised understanding of</page><page sequence="58">312 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 the form of the pagan basilica. Perhaps most significant is the realization that Vitruvius did not consider his basilica at Fano to be typical nor did he consider it to be illustrative of his so-called "normal" basilica. The recognition that the description of the basilica at Fano is not an elaboration of Vitruvius's five basic characteristics of a normal basilica has led scholars to place even more emphasis on the "normal" basilica. These five characteristics have been determinate in the architectural interpretation and restoration of many basilicas. There are, however, strong reasons to use caution when applying the "normal" basilica as the basis of an ar- chitectural investigation. This paper presents architectural and archaeological ev- idence from such sites as Corinth, Pompeii, and Ordona to show that there was a greater tendency toward variation from rather than compliance with Vitruvius's prescribed features and proportions. Even in the most basic of pro- portions, the ratio of width to length of the building, the majority of known basilicas do not conform to Vitruvius's ratio of 1:3 to 1:2; only approximately 40% do. In fact, the known structures indicate that deviation from the "norm" is more common than the "norm." What is now clear is that Vitruvius's "normal" basilica is not necessarily the norm nor is it the model by which all other pagan basilicas should be evaluated, let alone be restored. THE PORTICO OF OCTAVIA IN THE CONTEXT OF AUGUSTUS'S MORAL PROGRAM: Linda Maria Gigante, University of Louisville With spoils from his Macedonian victory in 146 B.C., Quintus Caecilius Metellus constructed a portico near the Circus Flaminius. Perhaps damaged in the fires of 31, it was renovated during the principate of Augustus and re- named for Octavia, the princeps's sister. Although not mentioned in the Res Gestae, this project was probably fi- nanced by Augustus. While the Portico of Octavia is dis- cussed in the context of the Augustan building program, little attention has been paid to the dating of and motive for the remodeling of the famed Republican structure. This paper is an examination of the Portico of Octavia and its relationship to Augustus's moral program. I pro- pose that he undertook this remodeling project at the be- ginning of his principate, honoring Octavia as the mother of Marcellus, his intended successor. Further, I argue that, in restoring the Portico of Metellus, Augustus intended to associate himself with Metellus because of their mutual concern for family life. In 131 Metellus, as censor, ad- dressed the issues of marriage and children and, influ- enced by his pronouncements, Augustus read Metellus's speech to the Senate (Suet. 89). Augustus's remodeling of the Portico of Metellus may well have coincided with his first legal attempt, in the early 20s, to promote marriage (Prop. 2.7). In its multiple messages the Portico of Octavia is typi- cally Augustan. It extolled the maternal virtue of Octavia and, hence, legitimized Augustus's dynastic ambition; it linked the princeps to a distinguished Republican; and, above all, it signified a renewed interest in the fabric of the Roman family. THE CARYATIDS FROM HADRIAN'S VILLA AT TIVOLI AND THE PANTHEON OF AGRIPPA: Pieter B.F.J. Broucke, Middlebury College The Pantheon of Agrippa, the precursor to the Hadrianic Pantheon in Rome, incorporated Caryatids, ar- chitectural supports in the form of female figures that Pliny attributed to Diogenes of Athens (Plin. HN 36.38). These Caryatids have been considered lost. In 1952, four Caryatids, full-scale copies of those from the Erechtheum in Athens, were excavated at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. As freestanding sculptures they decorated the southwest edge of the so-called Canopus. But compositional characteristics of the sculptures and technical articulations on their abaci indicate that the Caryatids had been recycled from a pre- Hadrianic architectural context. Comparison with the smaller Caryatids from the Forum of Augustus permits dating two of the Caryatids from Tivoli (Type A) as Augustan and the other two (Type B) as Fla- vian. This chronological framework matches the history of Agrippa's Pantheon: erected between 27 and 25 B.C., the building was damaged in the fire that ravaged the Campus Martius in A.D. 80, during the reign of Titus (Dio Cass. 66.24.2). Agrippa's Pantheon was restored under Domi- tian (MGH 9.146; Hieron. ab Abr. 2105), only to burn again in a fire under Trajan (Oros. 7.12.5; Hieron. ab Abn: 2127). The Caryatids of Type A appear to have belonged to the original Agrippan building. Those of Type B, then, can be associated with the Domitianic restoration. Considered in this context, the Caryatids provide new physical evidence for the elevations of the pre-Hadrianic Pantheon. As such, they add to the scant evidence for the building's form yielded by the foundations. SESSION 4F: COLLOQUIUM: "I WAS MOVED OF THE LORD TO GO TO CAROLINA": THE 17TH-CENTURY SETTLEMENT OF THE ALBEMARLE REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA "WEE CLEERED, FENCED &amp; PLANTED WHAT GROUND WE COULD": ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT THE EDEN HOUSE SITE: Loretta Lautzen- heiser, Coastal Carolina Research, Inc., and Thomas J. Padgett, North Carolina Department of Transportation Archaeologists working for the North Carolina Depart- ment of Transportation have investigated the 17th-century component of the Eden House site (31BR52) on the west bank of the Chowan River in the Albemarle region of North Carolina. The site contained a stockade complex ap- parently associated with the colonization in ca. 1660 of the Albemarle region, and is one of the earliest settlements in the colony. The complex contained over 500 features rep- resenting remnants of earth-fast structures, along with nu- merous fence lines and a probable stockade line. The site</page><page sequence="59">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 313 later became part of the estate (ca. 1718) of Charles Eden, governor of the colony. These investigations provide in- sight into the adaptation of European lifeways on the Caro- lina frontier. GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS AT EDEN HOUSE, AN EARLY COLONIAL SITE IN THE ALBEMARLE SOUND REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA: Thomas Hargrove, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill In the summer of 1996, archaeologists conducted flux- gate gradiometer and resistance surveys on a colonial site in the path of highway construction near Edenton, North Carolina. By combining results of two geophysical survey techniques, archaeologists were able to direct data recov- ery efforts to an area containing the remains of two houses and numerous other early colonial features. Early discov- ery of major features led to timely recognition of the site's importance and a significant expansion of the data recov- ery program. More generally, the success of the survey demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques for management and study of historical sites. The results also point out the importance of tailoring field methods and interpretations to suit North American sites, rather than using approaches that have been successful in Euro- pean settings. "THUS THEY LOITER AWAY THEIR LIVES [WITH] SCARCELY ... BREAD TO EAT": ARTIFACT ANALY- SIS OF THE EDEN HOUSE SITE: Patricia M. Sam- ford, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Loretta Lautzenheiser, Coastal Carolina Research, Inc. In The History of the Dividing Line (1728), gentleman sur- veyor William Byrd left little doubt of his low esteem for the people of eastern North Carolina, calling them slothful and indolent. Recent excavations at the Eden House site (ca. 1660-1730), one of the first settlements in the Albe- marle Sound area of North Carolina, belie Byrd's generali- zations. Analysis of the artifacts recovered there showed ev- idence of thriving trade, sophisticated architectural detailing, and the practice of genteel social rituals on the North Carolina frontier. The artifacts from the site are compared with those from similarly dated sites in Virginia and Mary- land to compare and contrast late 17th- and 18th-century life in these colonies. "FEASTING ON THE FAT OF THE LAND": FAUNAL REMAINS FROM THE EDEN HOUSE SITE: Mary Ann Holm, Coastal Carolina Research, Inc. Excavation at the Eden House site has yielded the larg- est assemblage of faunal remains from a colonial site in North Carolina to date. Analysis of the 14,000 fragments of animal bone provides valuable insight into the ecological and social adaptations of 17th- and 18th-century settlers of the coastal plain. Preliminary analysis indicates that the in- habitants of the site relied heavily on wild resources in ad- dition to domestic livestock. Although a large number of wild birds (such as passenger pigeons, ducks, and geese), fish, and small to medium terrestrial resources were uti- lized, there is a surprising scarcity of deer remains in the assemblage. I explore in this paper the ways in which the residents of the site adapted to changing environmental and social conditions over a period of more than 70 years. SESSION 5A: COLLOQUIUM: BEYOND BOR- DERS: TRANSCAUCASIAN-ANATOLIAN IN- TERACTIONS IN THE BRONZE AND IRON AGES THE SECOND WAVE: TRANSCAUCASIAN-ANATOLIAN INTERACTION IN THE MURAT/EUPHRATES BASIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C.: Mitchell S. Rothman, Widener University The presence of burnished, often incised, black and red pottery over a wide expanse of eastern and southeastern Turkey at the beginning of the Bronze Age has led to a number of theories of what this presence represents. Does this Transcaucasian, Karaz, or Kura-Araxes ware indicate a massive migration of farmers and herders out of the Trans- caucasian region where this pottery first appears? Is the pottery carried by pastoral nomadic groups? Is its presence simply a marker of the spread of another technology, that of metals, among Late Chalcolithic populations? Is this a rapid migration or a series of waves of either cultural con- tact or migration? I examine in this paper some of the evidence from south of the undulating plains of the northern Taurus mountain massif along the Murat River and at the link be- tween eastern Turkey and Mesopotamia. The latter area is where the Murat meets the Euphrates in modern Malatya and heads south toward the Syrian border. I attempt to un- ravel some of the alternative explanations implied in the questions asked above, looking both at regional survey data and at excavations along the Euphrates. The conclu- sion suggests some further questions that need to be asked before convincing and more complete answers can be offered. AT THE HEADWATERS OF THE ARAS: RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGNS AT SOS HOYUiK: Antonio Sagona, University of Melbourne Sos H6yfik is a multiperiod mound site near Erzurum in northeastern Turkey. The site has so far provided a discon- tinuous stratigraphic sequence of human occupation from the Early Bronze Age to the medieval period. Anchored by nearly 50 radiocarbon dates, the sequence comprises fun- damentally new information for a region whose archaeol-</page><page sequence="60">314 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 ogy is poorly understood. The deposits dating to the third and second millennia B.C. are especially important. The evidence necessitates a rethinking of both the chronology and nature of cultural contact with the lands of Transcau- casia. Late Early Transcaucasian (also known as Kura- Araxes and Karaz) material culture datable to the late third millennium B.C. is followed, at Sos H6yiik, by re- mains that bear a strong affinity with those from the Mart- kopi kurgan burials in Transcaucasia. Later still, in levels distinguished by temporary settlements, pits, and shaft burials ascribed to the first half of the second millennium B.C., very late Early Transcaucasian material continues to be found in association with remains that are similar to those recovered from the Trialeti kurgans in Georgia. These data are making it possible to begin a reconstruc- tion of late prehistoric highland communities of eastern Anatolia and Transcaucasia; until now, we have had to rely largely on mortuary evidence. SILVER VESSELS AND CYLINDER SEALINGS: PRE- CIOUs REFLECTIONS OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE IN THE EARLY SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C.: Karen S. Rubinson, Barnard College Exotic and elite objects excavated in Middle Bronze Age burials in Transcaucasia, and often compared to materials from Anatolia and Mesopotamia, have been used to date those burials. A systematic explanation for the external similarities, however, has been lacking. Among the silver objects of the so-called Trialeti culture are a goblet and a bucket excavated in the late 1930s by B.A. Kuftin from two large burials at the type-site in Geor- gia. A similarly shaped goblet with more elaborate decora- tion was excavated in 1987 by V. Hovanisian at Karashamb in Armenia. Taken together, these three silver objects, em- bellished with embossed human figures and animals, pro- vide a fruitful opportunity to examine cultural interaction during the first few centuries of the second millennium B.C. between Transcaucasia and the greater Near East. Previously, many scholars, including myself, have pointed out similarities between various objects from Ana- tolia and the Trialeti silver vessels. I demonstrate here that the strongest iconographic connections of this Transcauca- sian silver are specifically with the Anatolian-style cylinder sealings from the period of the Assyrian trading colonies at Kanesh and other Anatolian sites. In fact, it is possible, based on its style, that the silver bucket from Trialeti is an import from Anatolia. I propose that the artistic connec- tions are a reflection of an active trade between Transcau- casia and Anatolia during the time of the Assyrian trading colonies, a trade documented by elite objects but not re- corded in the Assyrian texts. THE EARLY IRON AGE IN THE VAN REGION, EAST- ERN ANATOLIA: Veli Sevin, University of Istanbul Despite excavations at Hasanlu and Dinkha Tepe and reconnaissance trips conducted between 1960 and 1970 by R. Dyson and his colleagues in the southwestern corner of the Urmiyah basin, northwestern Iran, archaeological evi- dence for the Early Iron Age in the nearby Van region has been almost nonexistent. Prior to 1992, the Early Iron Age in the Van region was only known through the small-scale investigations of A. Erzen at Ernis, on the northern shore of Lake Van. In 1992, a new cemetery was found on the eastern shore of the Lake Er;ek, located between Urmiyah and Van, near the village of Karagfindfiz. Eight chamber tombs were ex- cavated. The tombs and their contents are quite different from earlier Bronze Age burials, suggesting that a signifi- cant change in cultural pattern had taken place in the Van region toward the end of the second millennium B.C. Mul- tiple burials in stone chambers with an entrance shaft, red- polished monochrome ware, ornamental items, and ceremo- nial arms made of iron are the most characteristic features of the new culture. These distinctive new cultural elements appear later among the traits of the classical Urartian cul- ture, between the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. Present evidence suggests that there was a cultural unity around the Van basin during the Early Iron Age-a very different situation from Late Hasanlu IV, Late Dinkha Tepe III, and Early Dinkha Tepe II. Urartian culture was derived from the Early Iron Age culture of the Van region, which, thanks to the Karagfindiiz excavations, we now understand better. RECENT EXCAVATIONS AT THE URARTIAN FORTRESS OF AYANIS: Altan tilingiroslu, Ege University Excavations over the past 50 years at Rusai Eidurukai (Ayanis) have yielded important Urartian finds. In recent excavations that I have directed, tablets, hundreds of mon- umental jars, and inscribed bronze and iron artifacts have been discovered, associated with a susi temple. I concen- trate in this paper, however, on the art and history of Urartu. Ayanis was built by Rusa son of Argishti. There are another four towns established by Rusa throughout the Urartian territory. According to dendrochronological re- sults, Rusai Eidurukai was the last of these towns, with the fortress possibly built in 651 B.C. According to an inscrip- tion on the susi temple, Rusa II campaigned and took hos- tages from the lands of Mushki, Hatti, and Assur, and he built a town that we located on the eastern slopes during the last season of excavation. We should thus reexamine suggestions about the last years of the kingdom. Although the Khorsabad relief shows lion-headed shields hanging on the walls of the Musasir temple, no such artifact was found. An inscribed bronze shield depict- ing a lion head from Ayanis is unique in Urartian art. The occurrence of "shuri" on a dedicatory bronze spear, 76 cm long, ends the long-lasting argument about the meaning of this word. THE URARTIAN STATE ASSEMBLAGE AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE OUTER TOWN AT AYANIS: Paul Zimansky, Boston University A newly discovered inscription indicates that the late Urartian center of Rusai Eidurukai (Ayanis, Turkey) was</page><page sequence="61">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 315 constructed by the labor of populations imported from many neighboring lands, including Mushki, Tabal, Assyria, and Hatti. Despite the diversity of the people who worked and presumably resided there, the material culture seen on the citadel is typical of Urartian sites generally and may be characterized as a "state assemblage" in which artifacts and structures were created to uniform standards under imperial direction. In this paper I take up the question of how deeply this uniformity penetrated below the level of elites by comparing material from the settlement areas sur- rounding the site with that from previously excavated do- mestic areas at the Urartian sites of Argishtihinili, Karmir Blur, and Bastam. The model that best appears to explain the balance of uniformity and diversity is suggested by Inca archaeology, where the same population would use and produce state artifacts when engaged in compulsory ser- vice, and follow their own traditions at other times. SESSION 5B: COLLOQUIUM: AEGEAN PAINT- ING IN THE BRONZE AGE: A COLLOQUIUM IN HONOR OF SARA A. IMMERWAHR THE ENIGMATIC LADY IN YELLOW FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LADIES: Suzanne Peterson Murray, University of South Florida Excavations in the House of the Ladies at Akrotiri re- vealed fresco fragments of at least three female figures that decorated a room in the eastern section of the building. The scene of the room's north wall has been persuasively interpreted as a woman holding out an unattached flounced skirt toward a yellow-robed female in an act of rit- ual costuming (S. Peterson, AJA 85 [1981] 211; N. Marina- tos, Art and Religion in Thera [Athens 1984] 97-105). Numerous problems arise in attempting to define or re- store this scene further, or even to affirm this interpreta- tion. The yellow-robed figure, the presumed recipient of the skirt, survives in fragments that preserve only a section of her torso and one arm, touched by the hand of the first woman. This fragment group displays curious discrepancies from Aegean iconography and generates many questions. In this paper I address some of the more problematic details of this scene and particularly this figure, including 1) the tilted position of the yellow torso in the museum res- toration (an upright position is preferable), 2) the unusual placement of her arm and shoulder, 3) the uncharacteris- tic delineation of the back and hip, 4) the absence of black hair falling across her back, and 5) the low position of the unattached flounced skirt. By putting these enigmatic details together in different combinations, some divergent possibilities emerge in de- termining the pose and identity of this figure and the sub- ject of this scene. The yellow torso should almost certainly be viewed as a standing figure facing right (Marinatos's seated, frontal figure is untenable), but the activity repre- sented could be argued as costuming, disrobing, or the presentation of offerings. The identity of the yellow-clad figure remains the pivotal point in interpreting this scene, and the few preserved clues about her lead in in- triguing directions. THE "PRIEST-KING" FRESCO FROM KNOSSOS: MAN, WOMAN, PRIEST, KING, OR SOMEONE ELSE? Maria Shaw, University of Toronto Always problematic (poorly preserved and with unusual iconography), the restoration of the fresco of the "Priest- King" by Sir Arthur Evans has been the subject of much de- bate. More recently, J. Coulomb and W.-D. Niemeier have proposed that the nonjoining plaster fragments, depicting a crowned head, a torso, parts of a lower body wearing a codpiece, must belong to separate figures. Recent reexamination of the plaster fragments dis- played in the Archaeological Museum of Herakleion has convinced me that the torso must be restored with a head that faces right. Evans may be correct in assigning to the torso the only preserved head, which does turn right. Its crown is adorned with waz-lilies, which appear again as the beads of the necklace of the torso. Such matching symbols may well have identified the role and status of the individ- ual. I propose that the figure could represent either a male or a female athlete (the original color of the skin remains ambiguous). This assumption relies on the analogy of an iconographic detail that appears in scenes showing tum- blers and bull-leapers in the Minoanizing frescoes found recently at Tell el-Dab'a in Egypt and dated to the early New Kingdom. A triumphant athlete would have deserved the prominent position that the "Priest-King" holds in the mural decoration of the Palace of Knossos. THE SHIELD FRESCO IN THE PALACE OF KNOSSOS RECONSIDERED: Kathleen Krattenmaker Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens The Shield Fresco, found in what has been considered the domestic, or residential, quarter of the palace at Knos- sos, has been restored to the walls of the loggia of the Hall of the Colonnades. On first view, the painting, depicting large figure-eight shields as if suspended against a painted spiral frieze, seems merely decorative and thus appears not to fit into a fresco cycle that some have viewed as depicting the ritual life of the palace. A survey of glyptic representa- tions, however, provides clues to the significance of the shield fresco and its possible place in this cycle. A number of sealings from Knossos and elsewhere de- pict figure-eight shields, usually a set of three, placed over or on top of a spiral frieze, thus duplicating the elements in the painting. One sealing adds an additional element: warriors carry the shields, with the spiral frieze forming the ground line on which they walk. Because the spiral frieze here can be connected with the carved, relief, or painted spiral friezes that decorate the Minoan palaces, and which have not been found in other types of Minoan buildings, the setting of the procession depicted in the sealing would seem to be the palace. This sealing thus provides a strong indication that figure- eight shields were carried by warriors in a procession within the palace and helps to identify the shield fresco as emblematic-another "signpost" of the ritual cycle of the palace. It may be that at Knossos this shield procession passed through, originated in, or had as its destination the Hall of the Colonnades.</page><page sequence="62">316 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 THE NATURE OF NARRATIVE IN AEGEAN FRESCO PAINTING: C.D. Cain, University of Toronto Until quite recently, narrative in visual media has been identified with recognizable story content, particularly of a mythological or historic nature. Consequently, the figural arts of Bronze Age Aegean cultures have been largely over- looked in formal discussions of pictorial narration in an- cient art. In Aegean Painting in the Bronze Age (London 1990), S. Immerwahr includes a category for "Mycenaean Narrative Compositions," in which hunt and battle themes are addressed. Although it was not Immerwahr's intent to describe what constitutes a picture-story, her treatment of generic conflict scenes in such terms indicates that narra- tive features or values may be present even in formulaic and conventional representations. Building upon the contributions of Immerwahr and art historians who have broached the topic of visual narrative, I propose the adoption of a broad definition of pictorial narration derived from recent developments in the theory of narratology. When one's focus shifts from a search for known story matter to an identification of the underlying narrative structures and the discernment of levels or de- grees of narrativity, the narrative potential of Aegean art can be appreciated more fully. Indeed, despite the seem- ingly typical and recurrent aspect of their subjects, some Aegean paintings of ritual activities may be read as ac- counts of processes or events, i.e., as simple narratives. The Grandstand and Sacred Grove and Dance frescoes are cases in point. It seems suitable, therefore, to consider de- votional or religious themes as an additional class of Ae- gean narrative compositions. FROM THERA TO THEOPHILOS: AEGEAN PAINTING IN DOMESTIC CONTEXT: Sarah P Morris, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles The wall paintings decorating the houses of Bronze Age Akrotiri on Thera have received thorough study by Aegean specialists over the past 25 years. Technique and pigment, style and artist, and content and meaning of figural and landscape scenes, particularly ritual, have inspired interna- tional congresses, specialized monographs, and a host of dissertations and scholarly articles. Central to analysis has been the explication of the paintings within an Aegean fresco corpus to understand their production and icono- graphic program(s). In my study of the miniature frescoes from the West House (Aj 93 [1989] 511-35), I pointed to similar deco- ration in Roman houses around the Bay of Naples, the largest ancient corpus of murals with themes from nature, narrative, and ritual in private homes. Expanding this par- allel develops more rigorous models and methods for understanding art in a private context, well explored in Roman art. The houses of Thera belong to an island settle- ment unusually wealthy for the Bronze Age Cyclades, whose fuller disclosure (Xeste 4) may reveal grander struc- tures resembling Cretan villas and palaces. But we have lost sight of their domestic function in our pursuit of ritual and palatial themes. Fruitful comparison lies in domestic art closer to Thera than Pompeii, if more remote in time: the painted decoration of wealthy mansions in the Greek is- lands and mainland in the last century by painters like Theophilos, and artists decorating towns in Thessaly and Epirus. This exercise opens Aegean scholarship to more constructive engagement with domestic art in private homes, and allows us to consider more critically what guides such decoration. MINOAN MURAL ICONOGRAPHY IN ITS EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND NEAR EASTERN CONTEXT: Charles Gates, Bilkent University The Minoans featured a restricted range of subjects for the wall paintings that decorated certain palaces and villas in the New Palace period. Selected aspects of the natural world and religious and ceremonial activities predomi- nate; virtually absent are images of warfare, hunting, and the rulers. The absences are particularly conspicuous in contrast with the pictorial imagery of contemporary cul- tures of the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East, in which these themes often play an important role. Past commentary has often interpreted Minoan images as evidence for a nonviolent society. But this a priori as- sumption about images, that art directly reflects society, seems misguided in the case of Minoan art. It seems un- likely, for example, that the Minoans lived without warfare or foreswore hunting during the Neopalatial era. An exploration of the function of pictorial imagery in Minoan society is helped by a comparison of Minoan mural iconography with that of other Middle and Late Bronze Age cultures of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East. Varying choices of decorative themes in Old Babylonian, Mitannian, Kassite, Egyptian, and Mycenaean palaces re- veal similarities as well as differences with Minoan prac- tices. The larger lesson made clear by this contextualiza- tion of Minoan mural art in a broader cross-cultural perspective is that art need not be a direct representation of society, but instead reflects an ideology whose message varies according to context and audience. SESSION 5C: INTERPRETATIONS OF FEMALE IMAGERY THE APHRODITE OF APHRODISIAS: A HELLENISTIC IMAGE IN AN ANATOLIAN CULT CONTEXT: Lisa R. Brody, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Aphrodisias in Caria was an important regional sanctu- ary and, in the Roman period, a provincial capital. Its pri- mary deity was a local fertility goddess who eventually be- came identified with the Greek Aphrodite. In the second and first centuries B.C., the newly established polis ofAph- rodisias began to promote its patron goddess and to ex- ploit her connections with Julius Caesar and Augustus, who claimed Venus as their divine ancestor. As part of this promotion, the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias received a new image combining her ancient Anatolian stance with con- temporary Hellenistic iconography. The sanctuary of Aph- rodite prospered throughout the Imperial period, and the goddess became recognized around the Mediterranean. Her image survives in numerous versions and replicas, in- cluding statues, statuettes, reliefs, gemstones, and coins. The popularity and extensive dissemination of these repre-</page><page sequence="63">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 317 sentations reflect the Roman interest in exotic eastern dei- ties, particularly during the High Empire. The most striking attribute of the Aphrodite of Aphro- disias is her heavy, concealing overgarment (ependytes), which is decorated with figural reliefs. The style and design of these reliefs reflect Hellenistic concepts of myth and cosmology, and they date the creation of the image to this period. Although the overall form of the Aphrodisian im- age is similar to that of several other Anatolian deities, in- cluding the Artemis of Ephesos, its iconographic motifs uniquely suit Aphrodite and symbolically express her univer- sal nature. This paper presents the image of the goddess in its original context, exploring the cultural significance of an Anatolian divinity having a Hellenistic Greek iconography. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BODY: STATUES AND COSTUMES OF ROMAN WOMEN: Julia Lenaghan, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University We can learn much from the bodies and costumes de- picted in portrait statues of Roman women. Nonetheless, apart from a few well-known types, the female body for- mats have not been thoroughly examined in terms of their Roman presentation. This paper illustrates the signifi- cance of such formats on the basis of a representative ex- ample, a variant of the Hera Borghese. This format features the palla worn as a hip mantle, which consequently reveals the upper body. The upper body is distinctive because the tunica is not belted and has a stola over it. (The stola is infrequently visible on statues of Roman women.) To evaluate the use of this dress by Roman women, I confine my discussion to the eight stat- ues in this format that preserve portrait heads. All but one, which is Trajanic, date to the Late Claudian, Neronian, or Early Flavian period. Seven securely, and possibly eight, represent women of the imperial family. Moreover, six, three of which are the same, depict unsatisfactorily identi- fied Julio-Claudian princesses. In summary, the format has a defined period of popu- larity, conveys qualities readily associated with imperial women, and coincides more than once with the same por- trait head. These three facts can be profitably investigated and plausibly explained. The last is perhaps of greatest in- terest since it suggests that distributed imperial images might have consisted not only of a portrait type but also of a body format. From the case study, it clearly emerges that the bodies of statues were specifically chosen to en- hance the meaning of the monument and can yield valu- able information. AGRIPPINA MINOR: AUCTRIX OF NERO'S IMPERIUM: Katrina M. Dickson, Emory University Both ancient authors and modern scholars describe the empress Agrippina Minor as a power-hungry woman who would stop at nothing to gain control of the empire. In- deed, Agrippina did exploit her prominent position within the imperial house to attain the principate for her son Nero. Literary and historical sources stress her reputation as a formidable opponent. It is Agrippina's depiction in the visual record, however, that completes the definition of her place in Roman history. During the reign of her husband Claudius, Agrippina's position as the mother of a potential heir, Nero, is under- scored by her representations as the goddesses Concordia and Abundantia, fiurther reinforcing her role as guarantrix of Rome's continued prosperity. Subsequently, during Nero's reign, her preeminent political position and au- thority are broadcast in numismatic, sculpted, and glyptic images where she is presented as the auctrix of her son's im- perium. On a relief from the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias as well as a cameo in the cathedral at Cologne, Agrippina is depicted as Roma/Concordia crowning her son with a lau- rel wreath. Nero appears as a glorious victor, but it is his mother who confirms and grants the victory. A reevalua- tion of the visual evidence bears out Anthony Barrett's re- cent assertion that, in the later years of Nero's principate, Agrippina retains her power and influence. THE SALVATION OF IPHIGENIA: Glenda Middleton Swan, Princeton University The panel painting of Iphigenia from the peristyle of the Casa del Poeta Tragico (VI.8.3) at Pompeii, which is now housed at the Museo Nazionale in Naples (MN 9112), is usually referred to as the "Sacrifice of Iphigenia." This traditional title is taken from Pliny's description of a fourth-century B.C. Greek painting by Timanthes (HN 35.36.73): "Iphigenia ... stands before the altar on which she is to be sacrificed." Most scholars consider the panel to be a free copy of this Greek masterpiece, whose subject matter continues the epic theme found in many of the other paintings in the house. Unfortunately, this traditional interpretation of the panel ignores its most unusual and important feature- the use of continuous narrative. Iphigenia is carried to- ward the altar in the lower portion of the panel but, in the upper portion, she is also carried by a stag toward Artemis. This addition of Iphigenia's rescue distances the panel even further from its supposed Greek prototype, as the sal- vation of Iphigenia is absent from epic tradition. However, while the panel's placement in the peristyle isolates it somewhat from the other epic panels in the house, the nat- ural line of sight from the atrium makes an actual Lar altar its visual pendant. In this location, the theme of divine sal- vation, rather than the pollution of human sacrifice, is clearly more appropriate. Thus, the continuous narrative element shifts the intent of this panel dramatically, and this aspect of salvation should be included in all readings. SESSION 5D: WATER SUPPLY, BATHING, AND HYGIENE WATER, WEALTH, AND STATUS AT POMPEII: THE HOUSE OF THE VESTALS IN THE FIRST CENTURY A.D.: Rick Jones and Damian Robinson, University of Bradford Around the Augustan period the House of the Vestals in Insula VI. 1 was given a high degree of luxury, including ex- tensive mosaic floors, a bath suite, and fountains. Water features became a strong expression of wealth and status in a private house.</page><page sequence="64">318 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 Around the end of the second century B.C., the house was already an imposing property with garden areas and rooms with cocciopesto floors, but only a century later did it gain the trappings of a grand residence. Luxury was a late addition. The house had extensive mosaics, mostly monochrome, but with some polychrome elements. There were imposing water features, with fountains in its atria and gardens. The ceramics for this phase are consistent with a date after the construction of Pompeii's aqueduct. Later the running water features were abandoned, pre- sumably in reaction to the disruptions in supply caused by the A.D. 62 earthquake. Water was still used for display in the peristyle and atria, but with static features, reduced in scale. Water was now supplied from large tanks newly cre- ated within the house, probably collecting from roof areas. This sequence shows how grandeur and status came to be expressed in the earlier first century through the extrav- agant supply of running water. Facing a disrupted supply, the houseowners retained what water features they could, and made massive changes to the house to let them do so, suggesting that display remained a strong imperative for demonstrating status in the final years of Pompeii. ... HIC CACAVIT BENE: SANITARY CONDITIONS IN PUB- LIC LATRINES AT POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM: Ann Olga Koloski-Ostrow, Brandeis University Columella (Rust. 9.5.1) valued human excrement as a powerful fertilizer. In fact, it can provide as much "fertile" ground for the skilled social historian as it might for an ag- riculturalist. Did Roman urban planners in Italy in the first century A.D. construct public latrines with health motives in mind? The question may seem strange to us. How could public health and sanitation not be considerations for such facilities? In this paper I explore more closely the archaeo- logical evidence and the social and cultural realities of sev- eral Roman public latrines in Pompeii and Herculaneum in order to seek a more accurate answer. I build on the work of Richard Neudecker (Die Pracht der Latrine, Munich 1994), who has drawn a connection be- tween changing societal ideologies and the advent of "lux- ury latrines," dating to the second century A.D. and later. In the first century, however, while the medical writer Cel- sus was studying the color of urine (urina alba, dein rufa) and the causes of diarrhea, the archaeological evidence suggests that little attention was paid to sanitary standards in the public facilities built to dispose of such human waste. Flies gorged freely on many an open dung heap, and public latrines were not only dark, dank, and unsani- tary, but (with few exceptions) removed from general view, well hidden behind porticoes in distant corners of the city, and undecorated. The reality of the public latrine and the ideal of public sanitation for this period are scarcely con- nected at all. A POMPEIAN BATH AT SIDI M'CID (CONSTANTINE, ALGERIA)? Sonia Hewitt, McMaster University The baths of a Roman building uncovered in 1961 dur- ing a salvage excavation in the west suburb of Constantine, Sidi M'Cid, are undated. Two small bath suites situated in the southeast end of a partially revealed peristyle each have one room with a hypocaust floor. The smaller suite has only one additional room, and no distinctive features. In the larger suite, the hypocaust room is entered from a row of two unheated rooms, and is provided with an apse. Its floor is decorated with a mosaic in black and white with details in colored tesserae. G.C. Picard drew attention to similarities between this mosaic and those of a group of Pompeian private baths dating to the Second Triumvirate. I argue that a Campanian origin for the mosaic is prob- able, but the date appears too early, since the motifs also appear in the first century A.D. Meanwhile, the larger bath strikingly resembles the private baths of Campania in gen- eral, and Pompeii in particular. Notable is the absence of a frigidarium with an immersion cold pool. The apsed room resembles the caldaria of Pompeian baths, with a heated immersion pool over the furnace and a labrum in the apse, the type described by Vitruvius (5.10.4). This type of bath was being replaced before the end of the first century A.D. by one that incorporated different features in the bath suite. It is argued that these baths are important evidence for the diffusion of an evolving architectural form beyond the Italian peninsula. WERE THE PRIVATE TOILETS OF POMPEII HYGIENIC? Gemma C.M. Jansen, University of Nijmegen In recent years I have documented over 200 private toi- lets among the houses of Pompeii. Since they are found in houses of every class of Pompeian society, there is no doubt that private toilets were standard facilities in most domestic dwellings. This discovery seems to support the commonly held belief that Romans lived according to a high standard of hygiene. But is this true? Detailed investi- gation of the remains of a number of Pompeian private toi- lets reveals the extent of their hygienic qualities. That toilets could be flushed and that they were de- signed for easy cleaning suggests a concern for hygiene. Other indications, however, argue against this evaluation. The toilet itself was not at all hygienic. Open connections with either a sewer or a cesspit allowed easy access to rats and insects (like flies) to the toilet room itself and to the house generally. Also, the Roman habit of using sponges tied to sticks for the purpose of cleaning the body (the Roman equivalent of our toilet paper) posed tremendous health risks. Although the stick device was washed off, it was used many times over by many different people. Fur- thermore, most toilets were situated in the kitchen, which compounded the possibility of spreading germs. Although most Pompeian houses had a toilet, this does not automatically imply a lifestyle of strict hygienic stan- dards. We can now conclude that private toilets, in fact, did not improve hygienic conditions, but actually wors- ened them. FRONTINUS'S LEGACY: A CRITIQUE OF THE DE AQUAEDUCTU: A. Trevor Hodge, Carleton University Frontinus's legacy (the title of a forthcoming book) comes in two parts: what he says and what he leaves out. His work has almost completely escaped the critical exami- nation normal even for such respected sources as Thucy- dides: when he says that his measurements for the dis-</page><page sequence="65">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 319 charge of an aqueduct differ from the official records, we invariably assume, unquestioningly, that it is Frontinus who is right. Yet when he asserts that the Marcia carried 4,960 quinariae at source and delivered only 1,840 at Rome, the discrepancy by theft works out to a 1-quinaria illegal tap- ping around every 10 m of the 30 km most exposed to theft-which is ridiculous. Similarly, the well-known in- competence of his predecessors and the dishonesty of his own staff are accepted as fact purely because Frontinus says so. There is no other evidence. His lacunae are even more thought-provoking. What did an aqueduct cost to build? Where did all the money come from, and where did it go? Did there even exist such a concept as a budget? If the army was used, did that ap- pear as a cost in the accounting, or did it serve for free? How long would the job take? Our guess for the Claudia is 10 X 106 man-days, over half being in the quarrying. In tunneling the rate was probably around 0.25-0.3 m per day, and Suetonius's figure of 30,000 workmen on the Fu- cine Lake tunnel is astonishing. What were they all doing, and how many could actually get at the workface? All of these are vital questions--easier to ask than answer-yet perhaps from these gaps in Frontinus's legacy will come a better understanding of his society. THE AQUEDUCT AT ANDRIAKE REVISITED: Dennis Murphy and Melissa Mengel, Denver Society Ancient Andriake is first mentioned as a Hellenistic set- tlement at the mouth of the Andrakos River in Lycia. Over time, it developed into the port city of Myra. The city came into its own under Roman rule when it became an impor- tant shipping center for grain sent to Rome. As Andriake grew and prospered, additional fresh water for drinking and bathing was needed, as the water sources in the immediate vicinity were both sulfurous and saline. This fresh water was obtained from a source near Myra and brought down to Andriake via an open channel aqueduct. As the aqueduct neared the city, the terrain forced a single large drop in elevation. This elevation drop was accom- plished with a structure that an earlier archaeological sur- vey identified as a possible water mill. In 1997 we studied this structure and would like to sug- gest that instead of a water mill it is actually a water cas- cade. In this presentation we discuss the basis for this conclusion, the method of construction of the cascade, and its importance as an economic engineering solution. THE WELLSPRING OF THE ROMAN BATH: Garrett G. Fagan, Pennsylvania State University The origin of the Roman-style bath has been a matter of considerable scholarly debate in recent decades. Archaeol- ogy has been used to locate the wellspring of the Roman bath variously in Greece (R. Ginouvis on Gortys or Olym- pia), central Italy (E. Fabricotti and F. Yegil on domestic bathing suites), or Magna Graecia (J. DeLaine on Syra- cuse, Megara Hyblaea). Another approach, rooted in the literary evidence, has placed the development in Campa- nia, since the elusive Sergius Orata is credited with invent- ing pensiles balineae there, which many have taken to denote hypocausted baths (I. Nielsen). The contention of this paper is that the champions of Campania are right, but for the wrong reasons. Too much uncertainty surrounds Orata's invention to be certain it had anything to do with Roman baths. Instead, other con- siderations point to Campania as the context for the first appearance of the Roman-style bath: the concentration there of evidence, archaeological and literary, for early Roman baths; the later tradition emphasizing Campanian bathing luxury; the spirit of architectural and technologi- cal innovation attested in other Campanian "leisure" struc- tures (e.g., amphitheaters, theaters); and the convergence of central Italian, Greek, and Roman cultural influences in the area. The Campi Flegrei add another dimension to the debate, since their presence adds a powerful argument as to why the Romans developed the hypocaust into the fa- miliar suspensura system: to reproduce artificially the amenities of natural hot springs. All this makes Campania the strongest candidate for the wellspring of the Roman- style bath. SESSION 5E: THE WINE-DARK SEA How THE GREEKS SAILED AROUND THE SOUTHERN PELOPONNESE: David L. Conlin, Brown University Passage around the triple capes of Malea, Akritas, and Tainaron in the southern Peloponnese of Greece pre- sented one of the most difficult nautical problems for the ancient sailors of the Aegean. Historical, meteorological, and oceanographic evidence, combined with an account of the mechanics of sailing, helps explain why this passage was so difficult, and reveals part of the logic behind settle- ment at Late Helladic sites such as Epidauros Limera, Zarax, Kastri on the island of Kythera, Pavlopetri on the Laconian island of Elaphonisi, Tainaron, Nichoria, Pylos, and Korakou. The principles illustrated by an examination of the southern Peloponnese have application to periods beyond the Late Helladic and regions elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Additionally, the example of the southern Peloponnese points toward the potential of nautical fac- tors to help explain terrestrial archaeological patterns. ROMAN SAILING: OFFSHORE NAVIGATION BY WIND DIRECTION: Harry R. Neilson, III, Florida State University The recent discovery of offshore ancient Roman ship- wrecks north of Skerki Bank (A. McCann and J. Freed, JRA Suppl. 13, Ann Arbor 1994) dispels the previous notion that ancient sailors navigated by coastal piloting alone. An- cient sailing technology, keen Roman awareness of the car- dinal points in relation to wind direction (Vitr. De arch. 1.6.13), and the nature of Mediterranean weather patterns support the hypothesis that sailing by wind direction was an essential method of offshore navigation during the Ro- man period and was employed by the ships that foundered near Skerki Bank. The accuracy of a course sailed by wind direction de- pended on the wind holding a steady bearing over several days, a pattern common to Mediterranean weather. The prevailing wind in the Strait of Sicily and the Tyrrhenian</page><page sequence="66">320 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 Sea is northwesterly, or 3150. A direct north-northeasterly course steered from Carthage to Ostia is 150. O. Roberts (IJNA 24 [1995] 307-15) has determined that a close reach, a bearing 500 off the wind, is the point of sail closest to the direction of the wind that an ancient vessel could have steered. Therefore, a vessel sailing a close reach from Carthage to Ostia could have steered a course of 50 and maintained a course made good of 150, with the difference of 100 from the course steered accounting for leeway. Other factors affecting the course made good included hull design, sail equipment, wind velocity, currents, and sea condition. ROMAN HARBORS AND THEIR ECONOMIC HINTER- LANDS: A CYPRIOT CASE STUDY:John R. Leonard, State University of New York at Buffalo Although numerous Roman harbor sites have been studied, including such well-known installations as those at Cosa, Caesarea Maritima, and Carthage, few projects have attempted to reconstruct the economic hinterlands that served or were served by particular coastal facilities. The fundamental problem behind any such attempt to under- stand economic hinterlands remains the dearth of ade- quate archaeological or other data. Furthermore, eco- nomic hinterlands may have been quite extensive and numerous within a particular region, and can only be satis- factorily distinguished when the region as a whole can be considered. The island of Cyprus provides an exceptional opportu- nity for the study of Roman harbors and hinterlands, since the island is relatively small, the land is already to some ex- tent subdivided by natural features, and the entire coast- line is occupied with an extensive series of ancient mari- time facilities. The Cyprus Coastal Survey, which I have conducted since 1989, has recorded the southern sites in this island-wide distribution of harbors, while coastal sites and hinterlands in the north, a region inaccessible due to Turkish military occupation, are also considered through library research. This paper presents the distribution of Roman harbors in Cyprus and a reconstruction of their economic hinter- lands, based upon my own survey data, that of other past surveys in Cyprus, pertinent topographical data, and pre- modern evidence from the Cypriot carob bean industry. The singular correlation in Cyprus between ancient har- bors and premodern carob export anchorages provides a particularly useful tool for theoretical modeling in the identification and reconstruction of ancient hinterlands. "THEREFORE PLOW THE SEA": A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DESIGN OF DUTCH EAST INDIAMEN AND THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE VERENIGDE OOSTvINDISCHE COMPAGNIE: Andrea H. Schultz, Univer- sity of West Florida Economic historians and underwater archaeologists worldwide have long been fascinated by the industrious Dutch of the 17th and 18th centuries. Their country be- came the center of trade in Europe, and those associated with that trade found themselves moving goods all around the globe. The Dutch, especially the charter company Vere- nigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), or Dutch East India Company, were the "carriers of the world" and occupied a position of world commercial dominance between 1600 and 1800 due to their progressive economic policies and their specialization and standardization of ship design. What do the historical documents and shipwrecks of the VOC reveal about the owner? Records and wrecks are sim- ply dusty pieces of paper and soggy timbers without inter- pretation. The analysis of historical documents and sub- merged archaeological remains by historians and archaeologists shows that the Dutch were master shipbuild- ers who capitalized on the use of space and cargo in rou- tine ship functions to maximize their carrying capacity. The artifact assemblages illustrate that the Dutch were in- deed the "carriers of the world," routing goods to and from all corners of the globe. And what made all of this possible? The progressive economic policies of the VOC and its superior skill at designing "more ships [that were] relegated to specific duties and able to earn more [money] because they had design features specific to those functions" (R.W. Unger, The Ship in the Medieval Economy 600-1600 [London 1980] 277). These ships helped the Dutch economically conquer the world in the 17th and 18th centuries. SESSION 5F: PERSONAL AND PUBLIC PRO- PAGANDA IN ROMAN SCULPTURE ADORNING THE IMPERIAL HEAD: STYLE AND MEAN- ING OF ROMAN WREATHS AND CROWNS: Lee Ann Riccardi, The College of NewJersey The problems of identity and date that interest most scholars of Roman portraiture are normally approached by examining hairstyles and facial characteristics, as few other features, such as context or inscriptions, survive. Some Roman imperial portraits, however, do bear externally dat- able attributes in the form of wreaths or crowns. No real ty- pology has thus far been established for their treatment in sculpture, yet regional and chronological variations can be easily observed. For example, ribbons of the headdress can be tied at the back of the head in a variety of knots or bows, or obscured altogether by a swath of material that covers them more or less completely. Leaves can be large and full, or small, adhering closely to the head. Often, these are choices made by the sculptor that do not affect the overall meaning of the crown, yet no specific study of this sort of artistic variation in the treatment of Roman imperial head- dress has appeared. In this paper I first discuss the different types of Roman imperial headdress and their meanings, and then suggest a typology of wreaths and crowns, based on patterns deter- mined through my examination of sculpted portraits from Rome and the eastern provinces. The main features con- sidered in the typology are 1) arrangement and treat- ment of component parts (ribbons, leaves, or gems); 2) presence or absence of added jewels as well as their size and character; and 3) treatment of ribbons at the back of the head.</page><page sequence="67">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 321 GREEK PORTRAITS, ROMAN RECEPTIONS AT THE VILLA OF "CASSIUS" IN TIVOLI: Sheila Dillon, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill In the Roman period, portraits of Greeks of the distant past became essential decoration for the luxury villas of wealthy upper-class Romans, serving as icons of their classi- cal education and intellectual pursuits. The portraits of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are usually considered typical of this practice, and have been the focus of much programmatic analysis. While this villa indeed presents the best-documented display context, its portrait collection does not represent a typical cross-section of Greek por- traits copied in the Roman period. The subjects repre- sented at the Villa of the Papyri are, in fact, quite unusual and particular: many are unknown and many of the por- trait copies are preserved in only this single example. Better for understanding typical practice is the mostly neglected second-century portrait gallery from the Villa of "Cassius" in Tivoli. Here, all the subjects represented are identified by inscription, and the extant portraits-for ex- ample, Perikles, Antisthenes, and Aeschines-are well known from examples found elsewhere. In addition, the various inscription, portrait, and herm styles allow one to show how the collection was modified and added to over time. This paper sets the Greek portrait collection of the Villa of "Cassius" in its archaeological context, reconstruct- ing the history of the collection and its setting; and sug- gests how the portrait collection reflects the intellectual and cultural aims of the villa owner as well as those of the period, that is, the so-called Second Sophistic, during which the collection was formed. AN UNKNOWN PORTRAIT OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS: THE "VERMINA" COINS FROM NUMIDIA: John M. Riley, Institute of Archaeology, Oxford University As part of my larger study of portraits of Scipio Africanus-which will cover all portraits of Scipio from his adolescence to his death in the 180s B.C.-I discuss today the Numidian silver portrait-coins minted under King Ver- mina (son of Syphax) in ca. 200 B.C. These coins, which are always thought to represent Vermina himself (e.g., by Toynbee), should rather be identified as portraits of Scipio Africanus. The identification of the so-called Vermina coin-portraits is based on the following points: 1) the sudden appearance of an obviously Roman portrait on (previously artistically inferior) Numidian coinage, in sharp contrast to the Berber- featured earlier coins of Syphax (and even Vermina); 2) Scipio's fame ("Africanus") in Africa, not least as patron of Vermina in particular and Numidia in general- together with Scipio's African "settlement" (ca. 202) and his being seen as the embodied bearer of Roman imperium; 3) the history and political situation of Numidia under Ver- mina, coupled with Vermina's petitioning to be named "friend and ally" of Rome; 4) above all, the extremely strong resemblance of the so-called Vermina coins to Scipio's New Carthage coin-portraits (identified by E.S.G. Robinson in the 1950s), together with the equally strong resemblance of the "Vermina" coin-portraits to Scipio's "Canusium" coin-portraits and to the marble portrait head of Scipio (identified by Hafner) from Schloss Erbach. In- deed, "resemblance" is too weak a word, for the "Vermina" Scipio-portraits match exactly the Scipionic portraits just discussed. (Alternatively, one can believe that the Berber King, Vermina, just happened to look not only Roman but precisely like Scipio Africanus.) With the recovery of the "Vermina" portraits for Scipio himself, one more link is established in a chain of portraits spanning Scipio's career and campaigns-from the Canu- sium Italian portrait-coins (portraying Scipio as he was just after Cannae in 216 B.C.) to the New Carthage Spanish coins (of ca. 209 B.C.) and now to the "Vermina" portraits from Africa (ca. 200 B.C.). My full study of Scipio's por- traits will finally carry the Scipionic story down to his death in the 180s. FROM CITY TO EMPIRE: PROGRAMMATIC STATU- ARY AT ROMAN PERGE: Jennifer Y Chi, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University During the Roman Imperial period, a major urban phe- nomenon was the architectural and sculptural aggrandize- ment of many cities throughout Asia Minor. Perge, a city on the southwestern coast of Asia Minor, provides us with an excellent example of one such transformation. In the past 40 years, excavations here have concentrated on sev- eral Roman structures including the city wall, the south city gate, and a large-scale nymphaeum (F2). These struc- tures were positioned in close proximity to one another along the main north-south thoroughfare of Perge and were adorned with comprehensive programmatic statuary. While these sculptural programs provide evidence of the social, political, and civic values of Perge's citizens, an anal- ysis of the programs' iconographic aims and their effect on the visual experience of the Roman viewer has never been fully carried out. This paper provides a general discussion of the thematic relationship among these three statuary programs from Perge. While the architectural backdrop for these pro- grams varied, I argue that the programs were designed to express the city's position both within their local civic and cultural context and in the Roman Imperial world. The programs, for example, included sculptures of key Perge- ian deities as well as ones of the imperial family. Further- more, their placement within the city plan suggests that the programs were meant to be viewed in conjunction with one another. The wider aim of this paper is to suggest how a balance can be struck between the actual archaeo- logical evidence and a historically driven reconstruction of these programs. THE NINOS FRIEZE FROM APHRODISIAS IN CARIA: Bahadir Halil Yzldzirm, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University The excavation in the 1970s and late 1980s of the Civil Basilica at Aphrodisias uncovered an impressive and well- preserved series of sculpted marble parapets, known after its central figure as the "Ninos Frieze." The frieze com- prises a combination of figured and floral parapet reliefs</page><page sequence="68">322 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 that decorated the east and west upper colonnades of the Basilica. Its most significant scenes are inscribed with the names of the figures: Semiramis, Gordis (Gordios), Pega- sos, Bellerophon, Apollo, and Ninos. The main panel fea- tures the legendary founder ofAphrodisias, Ninos, sacrific- ing in front of a barren tree at an altar surmounted by an eagle. This unusual depiction, elements of which are known from the local coinage, demonstrates the impor- tant role of foundation imagery in the self-representation of Greek communities like Aphrodisias. Reexamination of the architectural setting of the Ninos Frieze indicates that the parapets were installed during the initial phase of construction of the Basilica in the first cen- tury A.D. Recent study of the technical and stylistic charac- teristics of the parapet reliefs, however, suggests that the frieze was carved at a much later date as part of a major re- furbishment of the Basilica in the late third or early fourth century A.D., after Aphrodisias had become the administrative center of the newly created province of Caria-Phrygia. The unpublished Ninos Frieze is remark- able both as a major series of Late Antique relief sculpture from a known archaeological context and as evidence for the long-standing Greek tradition of venerating legendary and mythological founders. THE SCULPTURAL PROGRAM OF THE NERONIAN ODEUM AT COSA:Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton, Cornell University Three headless marble portrait statues came to light in 1951 during the excavation of the Basilica at Cosa. One is a fragment of a partially draped male figure in the "hip- mantle" type, often used to connote a heroic or divine sta- tus for deceased men of distinction. The second is a toga- tus. The third is a draped female whose statuary type is a unique variant of a Roman creation used to represent priestesses. The latter two are clearly pendants both in their size and in the Late Claudian or Early Neronian style of their drapery. All were found in or adjacent to an Odeum built into the ruins of the Basilica, which collapsed in an earthquake, possibly the one recorded in central Italy in A.D. 51. An in- scription found within the Odeum documents Nero as the donor of the funds for the rebuilding late in the reign of Claudius. The Odeum has a scaenaefrons with three niches, the perfect setting for the three statues, considering both the Roman taste for decorating theaters with sculpture and the fact that the male in the hip-mantle was discovered in situ below the central niche. Archaeological, art historical, and epigraphic evidence suggests that the "hip-mantled" figure represents Claudius, dead and divinized in A.D. 54, and that it stood in the cen- tral niche of the scaenae frons, flanked by the draped fe- male statue representing his wife, Agrippina the Younger, on his left, and by the togate figure representing Nero on his right. Agrippina gestured toward her husband as priest- ess of his cult. The three together conveyed a message stressing both Agrippina's power at the time and Nero's dy- nastic roots: (adopted) son of Claudius and, through his mother, great-great-grandson of Augustus. ROMAN ARCHITECTURAL RELIEFS AT ANCIENT CORINTH: Aileen Ajootian, University of Mississippi A group of large Roman reliefs, excavated over the past hundred years at ancient Corinth, represents an unusual and ambitious architectural program at this important city in Roman Greece, and capital of the province Achaia. The most familiar panel, the so-called Man and Dog Relief dis- played in the Corinth Museum, is also the best preserved, but fragments survive from at least six additional slabs, each bearing one nearly life-size, frontal personage, both male and female. Stylistically, the assemblage can be dated to the first half of the second century A.D. While some fig- ures may represent gods, others could be personified local geographic entities, or regions of Roman Achaia. The clos- est parallel for the composition and possible themes of the Corinth reliefs is the sculptural program of the Julio- Claudian Sebasteion at Aphrodisias, which included per- sonified tribes, nations, and provinces, as well as divinities, imperial personages, and as yet unidentified heroes. The Corinth reliefs are tentatively restored in a column and screen frieze adorning the upper facade of the badly pre- served Lechaion Road basilica in its second phase. If this building was not erected by the city in honor of Hadrian, or by the emperor himself, another possible patron can be considered, Gn. Cornelius Pulcher, one of the first archons of the Hadrianic Panhellenion. An important civic com- mission, this sculptural program formed an ideological and visual link with the Trajanic Arch framing the Lechaion Road, emphasizing Corinth's role as the leader of Roman Achaia. THE HADRIANIC ROMA AETERNA: HER EASTERN PRECEDENTS AND LATE ANTIQUE LEGACY: Kim- berley Christensen, Florida State University Roma gained a new domain in Rome when she was in- stalled in the Hadrianic Temple of Venus Felix and Roma Aeterna, a temple that according to Athenaeus (8.361) housed the T1V;O Ilg 6Xoecog. As a city protectress, the Eastern Tyche was closely allied to fertility and the prosper- ity of her city, aspects that Roma occasionally gained in Eastern iconography but were traditionally lacking from her military guise in Rome. With the Hadrianic cult, Roma remained helmeted but acquired the epithet aeterna, an association with Venus Felix as well as the occa- sional cornucopia, thus linking Roma to the prosperity and longevity of Rome. I contend that the Hadrianic cult was inspired by the Eastern notion of Tyche and Roma's Eastern type. The Hadrianic temple and enthroned cult statue soon became popular symbols of Rome, and later writers consis- tently termed the temple Templum Urbis (e.g., Amm. Marc. 16.10.4; S.H.A. Hadr. 19.12). The established con- nection between the temple and the welfare of Rome was evident, for example, in a coin of 307, which named Max- entius Conservator Urbis in honor of his rebuilding of the temple after its destruction by fire. Although no longer worshipped, the Tyche gained a new prominence within imperial iconography in Late An-</page><page sequence="69">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 323 tiquity. There was continuity in type between Roma Aeterna and the Late Antique helmeted Roma repre- sented alongside other traditionally rendered Tychai. I fur- ther suggest that the Late Antique Tyche of Rome was Roma Aeterna both iconographically and symbolically, thus illustrating the impact and popularity of the Hadrianic notion. SESSION 5H: AIA/APAJOINT COLLOQUIUM: THE LATIN EPIGRAPHY OF ROME AND OSTIA (IN HONOR OF HERBERT BLOCH) "DLANA RECEPTA": John Bodel, Rutgers University An unpublished verse inscription from the Roman col- ony of Cosa in Etruria presents a puzzle. An elegiac cou- plet inscribed across the base of a statue of Diana describes the image of the goddess (Diana Augusta), "with these sa- cred cornua," as recepta and as showing the way to her temple. The stonecarver has contrived to arrange the text so that the goddess's name and the participle constitute the cen- tral line, and much seems to depend upon the sense of the phrase Diana recepta. Much, too, hangs on the horns. Of what sort? Stag's antlers? A hunter's bow? Trumpets? The horns of the crescent moon? These and other possibilities will be considered in the light of the inscription's discovery with the fragmentary remains of a cult statue of Diana, in the garden of what seems to be a private house at the end of a path leading to a temple. In its attempt to enlist topography in the solution of a textual puzzle, the presentation of this new inscription aims to pay tribute to Herbert Bloch, whose pioneering contributions to the study of the epigraphy of Rome and Ostia over more than 60 years are characterized by acute sensitivity to the relationship between inscribed texts and the archaeological contexts in which they are found. HERBERT BLOCH AND THE NEW CIL XV.1: E.M. Steinby, University of Oxford Probably every editor of Roman brickstamps has strongly felt the need of a new edition of Heinrich Dressel's masterpiece, now 100 years old. If this ever is achieved, the credit will largely go to a very young man who 60 years ago revolutionized the study of brickstamps and 10 years later published the first supplement to CIL XV. Well-known changes in his circumstances obstructed the way to what would have been-and indeed was planned to be-the logical conclusion of these studies: the new CII XV. But the foundations had been laid. The supplement in- cludes 618 stamps, both new and corrected or completed editions of those already known. The combined efforts of later brickstamp editors have not produced much more in half a century. Both specialists and archaeologists had every reason to rejoice at the publication of indices that Dressel never accomplished. While nobody questions Dressel's editorial skills, Bloch demonstrated with his I bolli laterizi e la storia edilizia romana the information that could be drawn from stamps when seen in their archaeological and historical context, giving a practical demonstration of method on pages that still re- main fundamental for the dating both of stamps and build- ings. The impact of that work is such that it seems incon- ceivable that Bloch had to dedicate much space to demolishing chronologies resulting from research meth- ods that did not take the stamps into account (e.g., Van Deman) or interpretations that, though completely unhis- torical (e.g., Cozzo), still had the power to undermine con- fidence in what Bloch proved to be most important histor- ical documents. The fields of research that have profited from the use he has made of those documents are many, ranging from the prosopography of the landowners to the history of the officinatores and the figlinae, from onomastic studies to lin- guistics, from social to economic history. What the archae- ologist and the topographer dealing with ancient Rome and Ostia see in everyday work are the results of research and a method that remain fundamental for the dating of most buildings of the Imperial period. There is no need to stress what this means for the history of Roman architec- ture or to the history of the brick industry. All this information should go into the new CIL XV.1, and something new can be added. The lists of stamps that can with reasonable certainty be attributed to named figli- nae will be much longer, and not only because of the new stamps. As Bloch has pointed out, there is no reason to sep- arate the various classes of opus doliare, and many "extra- urban" figlinae should join the "urban" ones. A no less im- portant addition comes from Dressel's chapter entitled "Lateres privati." Hitherto, hypotheses on provenance have been based on closer dating and conclusions drawn from the contexts in which the stamps have been found; these hypotheses can now often be confirmed by clay anal- ysis. A systematic analysis of all "urban" brickstamps would completely revolutionize the traditional alphabetical order of the "lateres privati," but to reach that goal, we need a wealthy sponsor. The comments on the single figlinae and stamps will be enormously enriched, as will the lists of findspots. All this could hardly be done without the aid of a powerful per- sonal computer. But references to Bloch's precomputer- ized magnum opus and later articles will constitute the core of the innovations with respect to Dressel. And the work will, it is hoped, be guided not by the intelligence of a com- puter, but by that of an exceptional scholar. WARRIOR, WAR-BAND, AND GODDESS: Paul B. Har- vey, jr., Pennsylvania State University We salute a scholar of multifaceted interests in the an- cient and medieval societies of Italy. Here are some obser- vations on a newly discovered, recently published text from central Italy that enhances our knowledge of epigraphic documentation in Italy and our appreciation of Late An- tique erudition. We thereby honor at least two aspects of Herbert Bloch's scholarship. A small black impasto bowl of an early fifth-century type</page><page sequence="70">324 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 known well in southern Latium, with a dedication to the deity Trivia, has come to light; this artifact reportedly (its recent history is murky) comes from the sanctuary of the goddess Marica at the mouth of the Garigliano River (cf. Strabo 5.3.6 c233). The bowl's exterior is inscribed with a nomen in an archaic Italic tongue (AHUIDIES); inside the bowl is an archaic Latin dedicatory/possessive statement. Both texts are written in a variant of the western Greek/ Etruscan alphabet. The texts have been published and dis- cussed as to linguistic and orthographic aspects by Mauro Cristofani (QArchEtr 25 [1966] 10-32), Marco Mancini (Biblioteca di ricerche linguistiche e filologiche: Opuscula IV..1 [1997] 5-39), and Brent Vine (UCLA I-E Newsletter 7 [1997] 15-19). Here I discuss three historical issues: 1) The dedicant Ahuidies as (archaic) evidence for a nomen (probably Hirpine) attested in the "historical" pe- riod as Afiedius at nearby Fundi (an aedile: ILLRP 604) and as Aviedius, a nomen potent among the Hirpini (cf. A. Schulten, Klio 3 [1903] 235-41). We thus have some addi- tional (epigraphic) evidence for the occupation of the ex- tended Latin plain by Italic hill-folk. 2) The remarkable phenomenon of another dedication by the leader of an Italian war-band to a deity at a known holy site. That is, the lapis Satricanus records a Valerius (Poplicola?) and his sodales dedicating to archaic Mars at Satricum (C. Stibbe et al., Lapis Satricanus [1980]; cf. J.A. de Waele, Gnomon 53 [1981] 677-82). This new text gives us a Hirpinian and his socii dedicating to the goddess Trivia at Minturnae. We thus have additional evidence for the social and political situation in archaic Latium--a situ- ation only hinted at in Livy's tidy annalistic structure. 3) We already knew of two dedications to Marica at Min- turnae (ILLRP 216; ILS 9264) and a third from Pisaurum (ILLRP 19). We conclude with comments on the remark- able confirmation the present text offers for the Late An- tique (fourth century) learned equation, Trivia = Diana = Marica. That learned equation can now be demonstrated to be correct: as Bloch has noted (in quite a different context), Macrobius and friends knew whereof they spoke. A NEW IDENTIFICATION FOR THE PORTICUS AEMILIA? Steven L. Tuck, University of Evansville An inscription in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology might provide a clue to the identification of a building that has been a source of debate in the archaeology of Rome. The inscription (KM 1428) is a modest columbarium slab that preserves a simple epitaph to a Philargyrus, horrearius of the Sullan family. This three-line inscription preserves the only evidence for a horrea privata in Rome owned or named for the family of Sulla and has not been included in the evidence for horrea at Rome collected by G. Rickman in his Roman Granaries and Store Buildings (Cambridge 1971) or the Lexicon topographicum urbis Romae. Other hor- reae are known at Rome from only a single mention in the epigraphical or literary record including the Horrea Pedu- ceiana, Horrea Caesaris, and Horrea Aniciana. If a Sullan horrea existed and was constructed in the first century B.C., as the inscription implies, it would have been named Horrea Cornelia following the practice of using the nomen as was standard then, but changed to the cogno- men for public buildings in the first century A.D. This brings us to the currently named Porticus Aemilia. The building as it is preserved is certainly not a Porticus of any type. Its identification is based on the location of the porticus, known from Livy 35.10.12 and 41.27.8, and the fragment of the marble plan of Rome that preserves the form of the building and the end of its name, LIA. From these it is taken to be the Porticus Aemilia. This identification has always proved problematic especially for the history of concrete construction and the use of opus in- certum. If the extant building is the Porticus Aemilia it would predate other buildings of similar form by almost 100 years in Rome. The construction of the building was in fact described by A. Boethius as more consistent with the period of Sulla. If we have a Sullan horrea, which would have been named Horrea Cornelia, and a building whose construction is consistent with the period of Sulla whose name I read as ending in [E]LIA, it seems a small step to suggest that it might be the Horrea Cornelia. THE ARCH OF AUGUSTUS AND THE ROMAN TRI- UMPH: Russell T Scott, Bryn Mawr College Fascination with the Roman triumph begins generically with Flavio Biondo's Roma triumphans (1457-1459), imita- tion with Charles V in 1536, seconded by Panvinio's De tri- umphis liber unus (1542). Had the latter work been com- posed a few years later, attention might have been given fragments of the Fasti that were discovered in 1547 in the Roman Forum in the general area where Otto Richter would discover the remains of the triple arch of the em- peror Augustus in 1888. Speculation about the nature of the monument(s) to which the fragments belonged con- tinued from the time of their discovery in the 16th century until the 1940s. Drawings made by Pirro Ligorio provided the basis for associating them with an arch of remarkable design that might-depending on the interpretation of his language - have been situated near the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. Support for this position, although not for the design of Ligorio's arch, could be alleged from the draw- ings of Martin van Heemskerk. Other scholars, mindful of the original findspot of the fragments, argued for their having been displayed on the Regia (also discovered in the 1880s), a building whose eccentric design owed nothing to Ligorio's pen. While there were and still are reasonable historical grounds to argue that such documents as the consular and triumphal Fasti might well have adorned the headquarters of the Pontifex Maximus, the peculiar trapezoidal shape of the Regia could not be made to accommodate the calcu- lated number of panels of the Fasti with their architectural frame. Attilio Degrassi made that demonstration and its corollary: namely, that the Fasti had decorated the Arch of Augustus, near which additional fragments had been found in the 1870s. It is true that the arches of Augustus have themselves been objects of scholarly debate (admirably summarized by Elisabeth Nedergaard in the Lexicon topographicum urbis Romae I, 80-85), but for the purposes of this paper it is only necessary to remember the setting of the triple arch, between the south flank of the Temple to Caesar and the northeast corner of the Temple of the Castors-that is to say, the southeast corner of the Roman Forum-and what was on it: a recapitulation of Rome's triumphs down to the Augustan era. While there are a multitude of other arches in Rome, some attested archaeologically, others only liter-</page><page sequence="71">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 325 arily, with which scholars of the Roman triumph must reckon, I argue that the Arch of Augustus is perhaps the most important of them all for a reconstruction of the tri- umphal procession's route to the Capitoline. P. LUCILIUS GAMALA OF OSTIA: A NEW APPROACH TO THE DATING OF His CAREER: John H. D'Arms, American Council of Learned Societies A famous and much discussed inscription--CIL XIV.375 (= ILS 6147), found at Portus in the 16th century, transported to Rome, and subsequently lost-records the cursus honorum of Ostia's best-known local notable, P. Luci- lius Gamala. The late Russell Meiggs and Fausto Zevi have notably advanced our understanding of the time frame into which Gamala's career must be fitted. For Meiggs, evi- dence internal to the inscription pointed to an early date; he thus summarized the chronology of Gamala's career: "Gamala. .. was born in the late Republic, probably be- tween 80 and 60 B.C. He had reached maturity when Cae- sar crossed the Rubicon, and was a leading figure in Ostia during the difficult years of civil war. He lived to see the new order established after Actium and deserved the pub- lic funeral that was voted to him when he died under Au- gustus" (Roman Ostia2 [Oxford 1973] 500). Zevi, while appreciative of Meiggs's efforts to analyze the text in its Ostian municipal context, parted company with him on archaeological grounds. The dating of the "quattro tempietti" east of the castrum and west of the the- ater, which both scholars identify with the temples of Venus, Fortuna, Ceres, and Spes mentioned in the inscription (lines 23ff) as Gamala's work, was the principal point at issue. Whereas Meiggs believed workmanship of the com- plex pointed to "a date towards the end of the Republic" (Roman Ostia2 351), Zevi argued for "the beginning of the first century B.C." (Zevi, in MEFRA 1973, 571). In Zevi's view, Gamala was born around 120 B.C.; his local career unfolded during the period of Pompey's ascendancy; and he died in or around 57 B.C. A gap of some 40 years thus separates Meiggs's Gamala from that of Zevi. Neither Meiggs nor Zevi was unequivocally committed to their respective positions, however; and Zevi concedes that a future exploration of the "quattro tempietti" will be required in order to solidify arguments for the earlier date. Under the circumstances, a different approach seems called for. I focus upon one distinct grouping in the se- ries of Gamala's benefactions mentioned in the inscrip- tion, his feasts for the people (idem epulum trichilinis (sic) CCXVII colonis dedit/idem prandium sua pecunia colonis Ostiesi- bus (sic) bis dedit, lines 17-20). The following points de- serve to be emphasized: 1) Among municipal benefactions in the Republican period, the epulum and prandia offered by Gamala are completely without precedent: S. Panciera's recent analy- sis of a dossier of 532 Republican texts attesting to some form of "euergestismo civico" by local magistrates yielded no parallels. 2) There are no municipal parallels for this precise combination of alimentary benefactions (epulum and pran- dium bis) at any time or place, throughout all of Roman his- tory. But given the special ties binding Ostia to Rome, the metropolis will repay attention. 3) The Elder Pliny makes it clear (HN14.66) thatJulius Caesar was the first in Rome to create official sanctions for public feasting; and in contrast with Pompey and other Re- publican magnates, Caesar is consistently represented as setting new standards for feasts, as going beyond what all others had done before (Plut. Caes. 5.5; Suet. lul. 26.2; Plin. HN 14.97) 4) The public feasting that accompanied Caesar's cele- bration of his triumphs (in September of 46 and October of 45) left an indelible impression on ancient minds. After the triumph of 46, Caesar gave an epulum publicum at which the people were said to have feasted altogether at one time at 22,000 triclinia (Suet. lul. 38.2; Plut. Caes. 55.4). Sueto- nius distinguished this epulum from the feast after the Spanish triumph in the following year, and refers to both feasts in the first clause of the same sentence, where his ex- act words are important: adiecit (Caesar) epulum ac viscera- tionem (after the triumphs of 46), et post Hispaniensem victo- riam duo prandia (Suet. lul. 38.2). These two prandia were considered important enough to find their way into the consular Fasti: (Cupra Maritima: G.V. Gentili, Epigraphica 10 [1948] 136-41); Caesar opened his gardens in Traste- vere to the people on this occasion (horti Transtiberim: Gen- tili, 136ff; cf. Val. Max. 9.15.1). I believe that there is a parallel for Gamala's benefac- tions, and that it is to be found in Rome. Gamala, in offer- ing an epulum to the colonists of Ostia at 217 triclinia, and in addition, at a separate occasion or occasions, prandium bis, was consciously imitating Julius Caesar, who followed his first triumph with an epulum at 22,000 triclinia, and his second, in the following year, with duo prandia. Finally, I seek to place Gamala's feasts in the context of his other benefactions, and believe it is thus possible to outline the main phases of his career-a career that indeed must have extended, as Meiggs rightly guessed, into the outset of the Augustan Age. SESSION 6A: COLLOQUIUM: THE LIMES IN THE ROMAN EAST A BRIDGE TOO FAR: ROME BEYOND THE EUPHRA- TES: Chris Lightfoot, University of Durham Territorial ambitions, power politics, diplomacy, reli- gious differences, and racial tensions all played a part in molding the shape of the Roman frontier in eastern Anato- lia and northern Mesopotamia. Similar issues conspire to thwart attempts by modern archaeologists to investigate the remains of this long-neglected frontier. In addition, in these areas emphasis has traditionally been laid on much earlier remains and precious few re- sources have been devoted to the excavation of Roman sites on or beyond the Euphrates. As a result the historical geography and archaeology of the Roman provinces of Ar- menia, Osrhoene, and Mesopotamia are poorly known, de- spite the fact that there exists a wealth of material. The frontier that Rome shared with the Parthian and later the Sassanian empire was the focus of Roman military and diplomatic attention at least from the time of Trajan until the coming of the Arabs in the seventh century. This fact has long been ignored by limes scholars, who have tended to concentrate on military sites in western Europe, the Balkans, or the Arabian desert. A number of sites in eastern Turkey, however, demand our attention. Indeed, some have already been irretrievably lost, notably the Com-</page><page sequence="72">326 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 magenian capital and legionary fortress of Samosata on the Middle Euphrates. The present paper is intended to highlight some of the Roman sites that exist beyond the Euphrates and, while ac- knowledging the difficulties inherent in working in that area, to encourage field archaeologists to take up the chal- lenge of investigating this lost frontier. ARMENIA AND THE EASTERN FRONTIER: REASSERT- ING GEOPOLITICAL ANALYSIS: Everett L. Wheeler, Duke University Primitivist trends in archaeology, combined with literal- ist interpretation of literary sources, have produced sweep- ing generalizations about the Eastern limes: a lack of strat- egy, no Parthian/Sassanid threat, and the Roman army as an oppressive occupation force; strong rebuttals have countered these views. Other recent surveys of only the southern sector create the false impression of the East as a Semitic desert frontier. I argue here against the primitivist- literalist school, in favor of the validity of geopolitical anal- ysis of the Eastern limes, Rome's only border with a state, rather than pre-state tribes. Armenia serves as the case study, through which Roman policy on the Upper Euphra- tes, the Caucasus, and even northern Mesopotamia be- comes explicable. Second, I reassert the significance of the East's northern sector. Geography dictated that the north, predominantly neither a desert nor Semitic, became the chief battleground of Roman/Byzantine-Iranian power politics: invasion routes followed the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, and Armenia (more often than not) was an area of contention. Transhumance, so prominent in the debate about Arabia, has no role in the north; foreign policy, not exploitation of local populations, guided developments and troop deployments on the Upper Euphrates and in northern Mesopotamia. Further, Armenian feudalism and border disputes with neighbors hindered either Roman or Iranian control of Armenia and necessitated finely tuned international conventions--even partitions of Armenia. In sum, the uniqueness and complexities of the Eastern limes receive emphasis. ROMANS AND PARTHIANS IN THE KHABUR RIVER VALLEY OF SYRIA: Michael Fuller and Neathery B. Fuller, St. Louis Community College Intensive archaeological surveys and excavations in the Khabur River valley during the 1980s and 1990s have helped clarify the range and distribution of Roman and Parthian material culture remains. Important discoveries at Thannouris (Tell Tuneinir), Resaina (Tell Fakhariye), Tell Beydar, and Tell Barri require reevaluation of models concerning the Roman/Parthian frontier along the Khabur. Rescue excavation work at Tell Tuneinir sponsored by St. Louis Community College has demonstrated that many features attributed by aerial photographic interpretation to Roman Thannouris must be reassigned to the Ayyubid- period Christian/Muslim community of Tuneinir. Roman and Parthian features at Tuneinir are buried beneath meters of Islamic deposits and have been explored in one portion of the site. Continued work in the Khabur valley promises further definition of the range and function of Roman sites along this frontier. NEW RESEARCH ON THE ROMAN FRONTIER IN NORTH SYRIA: Michaela Konrad, Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften From 1990 to 1995, the mission of the German Archae- ological Institute (DAI) at Damascus carried out a project on Roman defenses in North Syria. The investigations con- centrated on the area between Gabal Bigri and the Eu- phrates, where quite good historical evidence exists in con- trast to the archaeological situation. In this 60-km sector, seven Roman-Byzantine fortifications are known; six of them were already verified by A. Poidebard's aerial surveys published in 1934. The lack of datable materials from the sites and reliable ground plans is a well-known problem of this work. Consequently the project focused on the exact determination of the date, size, and architecture of the for- tifications in order to provide a basis for subsequent stud- ies on the history of Late Roman frontier organization. Sys- tematic field surveys or excavations were conducted at five locations: Sura, the fort of the Legio XVI Flavia firma, Qusair as-Saila, two fortlets south to Resafa, and Cholle. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) the first military installations probably date back to the middle of the first century A.D.; for the first time, we have proof for Roman activities along the desert road at this early stage; 2) Diocletian gave the impetus to refortify these places after the Persian Wars and the Palmyrian revolt, but this defensive system was not completed until the time of Con- stantine I; 3) the Romans maintained their desert frontier in this sector until the end of the sixth century, and there is no proof for an earlier abandonment of the military instal- lations; hence, the role of the Gassanid allies has to be seen in a different light; and 4) there are no settlements apart from the military installations, consisting always of the fort itself and a fortified vicus attached to it. These vici are completely uniform at the beginning but, from the sec- ond half of the fifth century and especially after the Per- sian invasion in A.D. 540, they develop very individually. This is also true for the Umayyad period where at most places there is proof for continuity. THE LimWES IN SOUTHEASTERN JUDAEA: Jodi Magness, Tufts University The limes Palaestinae has traditionally been understood as part of a fortified line of defense erected by the Romans to protect the eastern borders of the empire from nomadic invasions and the Persian threat. According to scholarly consensus, the system reached its peak in the fourth to fifth centuries, as a result of Diocletian's reorganization of the Arabian frontier. The references to the southern Judaean fortresses of Chermela (Carmel), Malatha (Mal- hata), Berosaba (Beersheba), and Thamara (Mesad Tamar?) in the Notitia Dignitatum and other ancient sources indicate that they were bases for Roman military units during the fourth and fifth centuries. This paper fo- cuses instead on other sites in southeastern Judaea, which have been identified by some scholars as forts belonging to the limes Palaestinae in an apparent attempt to "connect the dots" and create a continuous line of defense. Specifically,</page><page sequence="73">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 327 these are forts at Ein Boqeq and Upper Zohar and a series of sites along the eastern side of Mount Hebron. A review of the archaeological evidence, especially the pottery and coins, reveals that the forts at Ein Boqeq and Upper Zohar were constructed in the mid-sixth century, while the east- ern Mount Hebron sites date to the first century B.C.-first century A.D. Thus, the concept of a continuous line of de- fense of fourth-fifth century date is not valid for south- eastern Judaea, supporting those scholars who have re- cently questioned the traditional interpretation of the function and date of the limes. THE LIMES ARABICUS RECONSIDERED: David E Graf University of Miami Of Rome's 2,000-km eastern frontier, the province of Arabia is the best known archaeologically. In this area, S.T. Parker has argued for a limes Arabicus, a broadly fortified eastern frontier zone that insulated the province from no- madic raiders. Three particular problems about this hy- pothesis need to be reconsidered. 1) Terminology. On the basis of literature, papyri, and inscriptions, there is growing recognition that the word limes merely refers to a demarcated frontier zone, not a hermetically closed militarized frontier defensive system. 2) Distribution of the forts. The central sector, a 150-km string of Roman forts between Amman and Ma'an, is desig- nated the "outer limes" (Brfinnow and Domaszewski) or "central sector" of the limes Arabicus (Parker), but our sur- vey has exposed sizeable gaps in the fortified line and more forts existing within the area defined by it than along it. The eastern fringe forts are better preserved than those in the settled western area, where soldiers were barracked in towns. 3) Function of the forts. Pre-Islamic graffiti called "Safai- tic and Thamudic" found mainly east of the frontier line are cited as evidence of threatening nomadic invaders, but many are the product of a pastoral population operating within and outside of the provincial borders. In fact, our recent survey between Amman and Qatrana includes finds of these graffiti well within the "central limes zone," indi- cating an acculturated population. In sum, it appears that the primary function of the army in the East was internal security, not defending frontier borders. SESSION 6B: MYCENAEAN GREECE THE MIDEA MEGARON COMPLEX: RESEARCH IN 1996-1998: Gisela Walberg, University of Cincinnati Recent excavations on the Lower Terraces of Midea in the Argolid have revealed more of the surrounding build- ing complex and brought to light important new evidence for cult activity at Midea and for the presence of a shrine on one of the terraces. A large-scale system for the collec- tion and storage of water datable to the late Middle Hella- dic and Early Mycenaean period has also been discovered within the citadel, which apparently lacked access to a spring within the walls. The system includes two cisterns and five aqueducts. The problem of water collection and storage at Midea, which has been debated since the 1930s, is thus largely solved. The remains of three building phases dating to LH IIIB and one LH IIIC phase have been iden- tified on the Lower Terraces. NEW EVIDENCE FOR THE MYCENAEAN ENTRANCE TO THE ATHENIAN ACROPOLIS: lone Mylonas Shear, Athens Society Earlier restorations of the Mycenaean entrance on the west side of the Athenian Acropolis have assumed that the Mycenaean fortifications belong to a single phase and that the West Cyclopean Wall marks their western limit. These assumptions are challenged by a new restoration presented here. Examination of the site reveals that the bedrock to the west of the Mnesiklean Propylaea has been hammer-dressed in a manner characteristic of the Myce- naean period. At the point where the bedrock falls most steeply, it has been roughly leveled for a width of 4.50 m. In this same area there are badly weathered blocks of Acropolis limestone that appear to have belonged origi- nally to a massive Mycenaean wall. They suggest that the original western limit of the Mycenaean fortifications lay under the west side of the Mnesiklean Pinakotheke. I sug- gest that the fortifications in Athens had more than one phase, like the better-preserved sites of Mycenae and Tiryns, and that the West Cyclopean Wall, which differs in construction from the other parts of the fortifications, was a later addition. This restoration makes the bastion of Ath- ena Nike an integral part of the fortification system and it avoids the necessity of restoring terraces outside the fortifi- cation wall. The addition of the West Cyclopean Wall at a later phase creates an interior corridor with a right-angle turn and it makes the restored entrance at Athens, both in its plan and in its history, a close parallel to the en- trance at Tiryns. NESTOR'S WINE CUPS: POTS AND MYCENAEAN PYLOS: Michael L. Galaty, Mississippi State University Chemical and petrographic analysis of 310 Late Hella- dic IIIB ceramic samples from sites located in the region of Pylos provides substantial evidence for organization of the potting industry. Different vessels were produced and dis- tributed at variable scales. For example, coarse utilitarian pottery is likely to have been crafted at dispersed work- shops and exchanged in local contexts, whereas finewares, such as kylikes, were manufactured at one large nucleated facility and are found throughout the whole of the study area. Combination of these archaeological data with Lin- ear B tablet references to pottery allows the degree of state involvement in the ceramic system to be inferred. Individ- uals at the state's center, Ano Englianos, maintained little interest in pottery production and distribution, preferring to focus instead on the manufacture and controlled dis- pensation of prestige items at the expense of staple goods. Given the regional political economy (Linear B refer- ences seem to indicate ongoing segmentation of the "kingly" lineage and restricted, as opposed to free, access to wealth), this choice would have led to financial and so- cial instability. The structure of the Pylian potting industry can be fur- ther explained with reference to the ceramic ecology of Messenia, such as the location and suitability of clay re-</page><page sequence="74">328 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 sources. Pylian state administrators may have perceived very few commercial incentives encouraging operation of pottery workshops. The ceramic evidence from Pylos can be compared to that from other archaic states, such as Oaxaca, Pella in Jordan, and early Mesopotamia, revealing similar evolutionary trajectories in the development of pot- ting industries. CERAMIC ECOLOGY AND POTTERY PRODUCTION IN CENTRAL GREECE IN THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE: Thomas F Tartaron, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ian K. Whitbread, Fitch Laboratory, British School at Athens, and Kalliope Sarri and Efthalia Velli, University of Heidelberg . This paper presents results of a collaborative study of Middle Helladic (MH) I-Late Helladic (LH) I pottery from two important central Greek sites, Orchomenos on Lake Kopais in Boeotia and Kirrha on the Corinthian Gulf in Phokis. The research comprises detailed classification studies carried out by Sarri (Orchomenos) and Velli (Kir- rha); and scientific studies, including petrographic analysis of pottery, clays, and other raw materials, and the examina- tion of ecological factors in pottery production systems. Central Greece has long been deemed a center of inno- vation and production for Minyan and other MH-LH I wares. Few ceramic assemblages from the area have been published, however, and much of the systematic work on MH pottery of likely central Greek provenience has been undertaken in southern Greece. The typological study pro- vides new information concerning many aspects of pottery production at the two sites, e.g., ware and fabric types, local variability, and extraregional contacts. Similarly, the petro- graphic study is among the first for central Greece. For each site, we highlight significant archaeological problems to demonstrate the fruitful integration of petro- graphic, ecological, and traditional approaches. In the case of Orchomenos, we evaluate that community's role as a center of the Minyan potting tradition, and explore the intraregional dynamics of resource exploitation and pot- tery production in the Kopais region. For Kirrha, we assess the extent and nature of influences from continental and Aegean sources, and their assimilation into local material. We approach these issues from the perspective of ceramic ecology, which emphasizes the interrelationships of ceram- ics, environment, and human culture. MOLDED GLASSJEWELRY AND THE MYCENAEAN PAL- ACE ECONOMY: Amy Ostenso, Cornell University Molded relief beads of blue glass are a common type of Late Bronze Age Aegean jewelry. I contend in this paper that molded glass was a luxury item for elites produced as part of the Mycenaean palace economy. The strongest ar- gument for this position is that craftsmen produced glass jewelry in palace production centers, as indicated by the steatite molds found in palatial sites, including Mycenae and Midea in the Argolid and Knossos on Crete. Jewelry workshops discovered in the Kadmeion at Thebes also sup- port the idea thatjewelry production was a palatial activity. In addition, Linear B tablets from the Palace of Mycenae mention ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i (glassworkers), implying that glass- working was a regulated part of the economy. Glass was also a prized commodity and a high-status ma- terial. The blue glass ingots in the cargo of the Uluburun shipwreck show that glass was a trade good. Also, the quan- tities of glass buried with the dead in high-status tholos tombs indicate its value. Together, the evidence suggests that glass jewelry was a luxury item, produced in palatial sites and prized by people of high status. Made from im- ported material and accounted for in the Linear B records, glass ornaments were clearly part of the Mycenaean palace economy. Thus, molded glass jewelry is comparable in so- cial significance with gold, ivory, precious stones, and faience, the elite artistic commodities of the Aegean world. THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF LITTLE ICE AGE CLI- MATIC EVENTS ON THE PREHISTORY OF THE MED- ITERRANEAN: Jennifer Moody, Baylor University Few archaeologists would disagree that major glacial ep- ochs have had a huge impact on the Mediterranean cli- mate. Pollen diagrams from Greece and Turkey illustrate these changes quite dramatically. "Little Ice Age" events (LIA's), however, are ignored by Mediterranean scholars, who seem to view them as exclusively Continental Euro- pean events. Recent work on the medieval Little Ice Age has shown this to be false. According to J. Grove and A.L. Conterio (Climate Change 30 [1995] 223-47), the medieval LIA in Crete was characterized by significant winter and spring droughts, exceptionally severe winters, and summer rain. Frosts repeatedly destroyed olive crops in France and Italy, but did not affect Cretan olives, which flourished. Significant Holocene glacial advances date from 9400- 9000 b.p. (Schlaten Advance), 3600-3000 b.p. (Loebben Advance), A.D. 800-900, and A.D. 1350-1850 (medieval Little Ice Age). Of particular interest is the Loebben Ad- vance, which was probably more severe than the medieval Little Ice Age. Its major advances seem to correspond to Early Bronze III and Late Bronze III in the eastern Medi- terranean, both periods of tremendous cultural upheaval. Colder temperatures in continental Eurasia may have pushed mobile populations south toward the milder cli- mates of the Mediterranean basin, while drought to the south and east of the Mediterranean drove other popula- tions north. Coincidence does not prove causality. Nevertheless, in light of the recent impact of the much lesser El Nifio weather event on the modern world, it would be foolish to continue to ignore the relevance of European Little Ice Age events in Mediterranean studies-past, present, and future. SESSION 6C: FIRST-MILLENNIUM B.C. CY- PRUS AND ANATOLIA RECENT EXCAVATIONS AT IDALION, CYPRUS: Pam- ela Gabes University of Arizona, Margaret E. Morden, University of Michigan, and Larissa Hordynsky, Boston Society During recent excavation seasons, the University of Ari- zona Expedition to Idalion under the direction of Pamela Gaber investigated a six-acre sacred grove/outdoor te- menos dedicated to the deity known as the Young Lord, or "Adonis." The past few years of excavation have unearthed</page><page sequence="75">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 329 evidence of metalworking, olive oil production, and votive dedications of terracotta figurines and limestone statuary (some life-size and larger). Some of these practices are well known from elsewhere; others are unknown within sa- cred precincts; but all are informative about cult. In addi- tion, in 1997, a pair of Cypro-Minoan inscriptions was found, pushing the dates of the two acropoleis back to the 11th century B.C. Similarly, in the Lower City domestic and industrial complex, a massive bothros has been located very near the center of olive oil production. Almost all the artifacts from this deposit dated to the Cypro-Geometric period. Excava- tions in the 1997 season, however, demonstrated that the bothros was filled during the Hellenistic period. What ap- pears to be a horn-working complex was also unearthed in 1997. Its excavation was completed during the 1998 sea- son, revealing a rectangular, plastered basin carefully built into the virgin marl. Nearby was found what appears to be a "blacksmith's shop," with remains of copper, iron, and lead all being worked within the same enclosure. Also during the 1998 season we opened a new field in the Lower City opposite the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age industrial area discovered recently by the Depart- ment of Antiquities of Cyprus. In this area we uncovered substantial architecture that appears to date back to the Cypro-Geometric period. Work will continue in 1999. AEGEAN POTTERY: A LATE BRONZE AND IRON AGE ROAD MAP TO SOUTHERN ANATOLIA: Lynn Swartz, University of California, Los Angeles During the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, there is a no- table scarcity of Aegean-related pottery in the Kahraman- marash Valley in Turkey. This valley forms the northeast edge of the Cilician Plain and is due north of the Amuq. It was home to the Luwian kingdom of Gurgum in the Iron Age, and presumably was incorporated into the Hittite em- pire in the late second millennium. From 1993 to 1997, a UCLA team led by Elizabeth Carter extensively surveyed the Kahramanmarash Valley, finding over 250 new sites, including more than 50 with Late Bronze or Iron Age remains. Of the hundreds of thousands of sherds collected, however, only a miniscule percentage were of Aegean or Aegean-related types. This distribution prompts a reconsideration of assump- tions about trade and travel patterns in this area in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Strong local control of borders, the existence of competing centers, and the difficulty of tra- versing this valley in summer and winter are possible expla- nations for the fact that, while Aegean pottery is common- place at Tarsus, Kinet Hoyinik, and (atal H6oyk (Amuq), the amount found in the Kahramanmarash Valley is mini- mal. Thus, despite Irene Winter's assertion that "all roads lead to Marash," the regional distribution pattern of Aegean- type ceramics suggests quite the opposite. THE CYPRO-CILICIAN IRON AGE ASSEMBLAGE AT KINET HOYUK, TURKEY: Tamar Hodos, Univer- sity of Cambridge The Near Eastern coast provides us with rich evidence for Iron Age commerce over long distances. Levantine, Cypriot, and Greek ceramics have been found at sites such as Tarsus, Ras el Bassit, Tell Sukas, and Tyre. These harbors have been discussed as ports of trade serving the elite of the neo-Hittite and Assyrian kingdoms. Scholarship has tended to focus on more far-reaching communication, however (notably with Greece), rather than on features that might define the regional character within which the extended exchanges took place. This paper addresses how another harbor site, Kinet H6yilk, on the eastern coast of the Iskenderun Gulf, can define such cultural distinctions in the eastern Mediterra- nean. Excavations conducted by Bilkent University since 1992 are uncovering significant Iron Age occupational de- posits, as part of the site's long history of settlement. Dur- ing the Middle and Late Iron Age (ninth-sixth centuries B.C.), ceramic imports show a settlement actively involved in trade with its regional neighbors, and more limited ex- change with Greece. Locally made Kinet vessels appear to have been inspired by Cypriot vessels in shape and decora- tion. The sample shows its greatest affinity with the as- semblage from Tarsus, where kilns were also attested. Therefore, Kinet and Tarsus can be considered specifi- cally in a Cypro-Cilician milieu within the more general Levantine context. ATHIENOU ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, 1998: THE NINTH SEASON OF INVESTIGATIONS AT ATHIENOU- MALLOURA, CYPRUS: Michael K. Toumazou, David- son College, P Nick Kardulias, College of Wooster, and Derek B. Counts, Brown University The Athienou Archaeological Project, sponsored by Davidson College and supported by a National Science Foundation grant, conducted its ninth season of investiga- tions at the site of Athienou-Malloura between 31 May and 18 July 1998. Our work involved some 40 individuals repre- senting 14 U.S. institutions, and focused on the Archaic- Roman rural sanctuary. In the eastern part of the sanctuary, EU 10, excavation down to bedrock of the floor packing associated with the sanctuary's reorganization in the late fourth century B.C. did not reveal any new architecture. Among the most inter- esting finds were incised sheep/goat scapulas, a fragmen- tary incised sherd in Cypro-syllabic making reference to "[good] fortune," and a molded terracotta figuring of the Astarte-Aphrodite type; the figurine represents the only ex- ample of a female divinity from the sanctuary. Excavation to the west (EU 18) revealed basal levels of a previously discovered east-west peribolos (?) wall and an adjacent hard-packed floor. Most noteworthy among the many finds here was a fully preserved one-third life-size limestone statue of a draped male wearing a conical cap. The purpose of work in two new areas, EU 22 and 24, and the reinvestigation of EU 2 was to define the western limits of the temenos and clarify the relationship between the eastern (EU 10), central, and western parts of the sanctu- ary. Due to pitting, EU 22 failed to determine conclusively the sanctuary's elusive southwest corner. Extensive pitting hampered our work in EU 4 and 24 as well; however, a hard-packed layer resembling that in EU 10 was exposed. Stratified finds (e.g., lamps, and two coins of Alexander the Great) above and within the packing support an Early Hellenistic date for it. In EU 24, a possible northwest- southeast wall (resembling, and at right angles to, a wall exposed last year in EU 94) may represent an attempt at</page><page sequence="76">330 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 terracing during the Archaic period. Further excavation is needed to establish the architectural layout of this central portion of the sanctuary and its relationship to previously discovered walls in other areas. A REEXAMINATION OF THE CULT PLACES AT THE VOUNI PALACE, CYPRUS: Mary-Grace Weir, Prince- ton University Discussion of the primarily fifth-century B.C. palace at Vouni in Cyprus has often focused on whether its history can illuminate the political situation and ethnic relations of the period. The palace is also remarkable, however, for the number of cult sites that have been identified in its im- mediate vicinity. They are interesting for the continuation of cult and the elaboration of the temene from the Archaic into the Classical period and for the rather unusual pres- ence of the goddess Athena. To date, the cults and their significance for our understanding of the society that par- ticipated in them have received little attention. In this pa- per I consider the evidence for the cult places surrounding the palace and for the sanctuary of Athena located just above the palace on the highest terrace of Vouni hill. The reexamination of excavated material leads to two main conclusions: 1) there is little evidence for identifying as sanctuaries some of the structures near the palace, and they should no longer be included in the discussion of sanctuaries and their typologies; and 2) there is some evi- dence for a limited use of the Vouni sanctuaries after the destruction of the palace itself. These conclusions pro- vide a framework for a brief consideration of the securely identified cult places, the types of cults practiced there, and their significance for the palace and in a wider Cyp- riot context. THE EARLY ARCHAIC CEMETERY FROM CLAZOME- NAE: Yayar Ersoy, Bilkent University Recent excavations at Clazomenae on the west coast of Turkey have uncovered a cemetery in an excellent state of preservation, comprising 185 burials dating from the seventh to fourth centuries B.C. There are three clearly distinct phases of Archaic burials, those of the first two phases in separate wall-enclosed compounds, suggesting family plots based on descent and kinship. The earliest of these burials are cremations, followed by inhumations in terracotta coffins, and amphoras for the infants. The cem- etery appears then not to have been used for at least two generations until the late sixth century, when there is again interment in terracotta sarcophagi. Grave goods include East Greek pottery and Corinthian imports (the latter providing solid dating evidence), bronze rings, bracelets and fibulae, and occasional terra- cotta figurines. Notably absent are metal weapons. Cook- ing pots and drinking vessels found above the graves sug- gest that a funerary banquet followed interment. The practice of making terracotta coffins at Clazome- nae began by the end of the seventh century B.C., probably as a result of the establishment of close links with Egypt. The sixth-century sarcophagi in this newly discovered cem- etery are of canonical type, but those of the seventh cen- tury, the earliest examples of Clazomenian sarcophagi ever found, are decorated with large-scale scenes of ani- mal fights, reflecting a direct influence of Wild Goat Style pottery. The information from this cemetery makes a significant contribution to our present knowledge of artistic currents, social dynamics, burial practices, and beliefs in Ionia dur- ing the Archaic period. SESSION 6D: GREEK ICONOGRAPHY WARRIORS, YOUTHS, AND TRIPODS: THE VISUAL POETICS OF POWER IN GEOMETRIC AND EARLY ARCHAIC GREECE: Nassos Papalexandrou, Prince- ton University In the last generation, a considerable amount of schol- arship has concentrated on the typology and chronology of Geometric and Early Archaic tripods, the most presti- gious dedications at Olympia, Delphi, and Athens. Yet, comparatively little attention has been given to the iconog- raphy of their anthropomorphic attachments in bronze. These figures take the form in the eighth century of a war- rior with uplifted right arm holding a spear, a schema suc- ceeded in the seventh century by the so-called handle- holders (Ringhenkelhalter). In this paper I discuss the ico- nography of these bronze attachments in light of the meanings of the tripod in early Greek culture. A symbol of wealth, authoritative discourse, and political power, the tri- pod can be seen as an attribute of the dedicator whose ideological claims are encapsulated by the warrior schema that renders in visual terms the Homeric ideal of leader- ship "to be a doer of deeds and a master of speech" (II. 9.443). On the other hand, in the seventh century the handle-holder iconography is devised to encode a novel political statement: in the hands of the handle-holding youths the tripod becomes a shared symbol as it actualizes the collective representation of the community in the eyes of the gods and the panhellenic society of the humans. In early Greece tripods played a focal role in public rituals that dramatized the messages encoded in their anthropo- morphic attachments. MYTHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE PAR- THENON FRIEZE: THE EAST FRIEZE - THE ARGU- MENT CONTINUES: JoanJ. Earley, State University of New York at Albany Archaeological evidence is the most compelling founda- tion for any theory involving the interpretation of mytho- logical iconography and it is this evidence that is used to challenge Joan Connelly's position in "Parthenon and Par- thenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze," AJA 100 (1996) 53-80. Extensive research casts doubt on her theory in general; moreover, a stone docu- ment described by J.K. Davies in Democracy and Classical Greece2 (London 1993) concerns the Praxiergidai, the pres- tigious Athenian clan responsible for the weaving and maintenance of the peplos that was placed on the statue of Athena during the Panathenaic festival. The document is clearly political and reveals their demand for more public recognition. In this paper I argue that the hereditary rights of the Praxiergidai were literally carved in stone on the</page><page sequence="77">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 331 east frieze of the Parthenon in order to pacify the clan. The two figures on the east frieze upon which Connelly bases much of her theory of ritual sacrifice represent the handing over of the worn peplos from an adult member of the clan to a younger male, symbolizing the continuity and tradition of the Praxiergidai. DOCUMENTATION AND RESTORATION: A WHITE- GROUND CUP BY THE SOTADES PAINTER REEXAM- INED: Maria Papaioannou, University of British Columbia The traditional approach to the study of vase painting concentrates primarily on the identification of the artist/ workshop and the pictorial representation. This approach is well illustrated by the scholarship on the collection of Greek vases in the British Museum, which includes a famil- iar white-ground kylix, London D7, depicting a seminude male about to attack a snake, and the lower half of a fe- male. The cup, attributed to the Sotades painter (475-450 B.C.), belongs to a group believed to have come from an Athenian tomb in 1890. Most major publications on the kylix focus on the identity of those portrayed; Eurydice and Aristaios, Orion and Artemis, and Kadmos and Eu- ropa are among the many proposals (A. Collinge, AntK 31 [1988] 9-19). Research, however, into the documentation of museum pieces that originated from illicit excavations-such as the London D7 kylix-is seldom emphasized. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is not to propose yet another identifi- cation of the enigmatic scene, but to focus on the docu- mentation of the artifact. Questions concerning the prove- nance of the cup, its findspot, the exact date and circumstances of its discovery, those responsible for the discovery and reconstruction of the object, and the condi- tion of the cup before its arrival at the British Museum are addressed. This investigation not only sheds light on some of the questions posed, but also reinforces the importance of exercising caution when dealing with museum objects not acquired through scientific excavation methods. ABDUCTION IN ARCHAIC GREEK ICONOGRAPHY: DOES "No" REALLY MEAN "No"? Ann-Marie Knob- lauch, Virginia Polytechnic Institute The FranCois Vase, the polos from the caryatid of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi, and Archaic staters from Tha- sos are all Archaic Greek objects that depict a satyr clutch- ing a female in his arms. The female's apparent state of helplessness has led to the interpretation that she is being abducted. Similar compositions are common on Attic vases of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., often in scenes of Dionysiac revelry. This paper addresses three points regarding these ab- ductions: the precise nature of the relationship between the satyr and the female and the appropriateness of the word "abduction" to describe the activity; the validity of comparisons with similar compositions found on Attic vases with Dionysiac themes; and a clarification of the meaning of this scene in Archaic cult. The identification of the female figure is critical in this analysis. An inscription identifies her as a nymph on the Francois Vase, and I argue that she is a nymph (not a maenad) on the other monuments as well. The union of satyrs and nymphs, both semidivine creatures of the wild, is beneficial for agriculture, and, appropriately, sexually en- ergetic. A positive perspective on their relationship is also more suitable for the public monuments on which this scene at times occurs. Furthermore, nymphs do not have the same long-standing relationship with Dionysos that the maenads do. In the Archaic world, the satyrs and nymphs unite in the natural world as potent, independent, and positive demons. EXPRESSIONS OF HARMONY: FEMALE MUSICIANS ON FIFTH-CENTURY ATTIC VASES: Sheramy D. Bundrick, Emory University A red-figure bell krater by the Danae Painter (Metropol- itan Museum of Art, 23.160.80) featuring a woman playing a barbitos before two female listeners raises interesting questions regarding the relationship between women, mu- sic, art, and society in Classical Athens. The scene is one of many images of female musicians in a domestic setting found on fifth-century vases. These representations, which date from the period ca. 460-410 B.C., mark a significant departure from earlier images of women playing music. I argue that rather than depicting Muses or professional hetairai, this scene and others like it show privileged mor- tal women who engage in musical performance as an expres- sion of leisure. The scenes are likely to reflect some aspect of reality, but should not be interpreted as photographic snapshots of daily life. Rather, they are constructions that have several layers of meaning, referring both to the actual activities of women and to the symbolic aspects of music and gender. The Danae Painter's krater is particularly striking be- cause of its intense portrayal of the relationship between performer and audience, and the effects of music upon both. The emphasis on performance found in this scene is echoed in other musical images of the period. I propose that the iconography of the vase reflects contemporary developments in musical theory and philosophy. Most no- tably, the scene appears to convey ideas of ethos, the charac- ter of musical composition, through its artistic composition. Moreover, the artist has drawn upon the contemporary in- terest in female subject matter to create an image that communicates the ideals of harmonia, harmony in a musi- cal, social, and visual sense. SESSION 6E: ETRURIA AND SOUTH ITALY FAMILIES, FEASTING, AND FUNERALS: TOMB PRAC- TICE AND RITUAL AT CAERE: Lisa Pieraccini, Uni- versity of California, Santa Barbara In recent years, Etruscan banquets have been the topic of much discussion, in particular, the study and decoding of their iconography. Interest in banquets in Etruscan daily life is a refreshing change from the numerous articles on tombs, but have we really exhausted all information the tombs have to offer concerning the funerary feasting cus- toms and rituals of the Etruscans? Since much of our evi- dence for Etruscan banquet iconography has a funerary context, it seems only logical to ask whether feasting took</page><page sequence="78">332 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 103 place in the tomb as part of the funerary ritual. Caere is a most appropriate area to look for such practices. The act of honoring the deceased in the tomb rein- forces the attempts made by Caeretans to re-create the home of the living. We can assume that items left in tombs were part of this custom. Yet one wonders whether they were placed in the tombs to supply the deceased with ban- quet accoutrements to use in the afterlife, and also whether they were used by the family of the deceased prior to sealing the tomb? Both scenarios are likely. By careful observation of the contents in the princely tombs at Caere, comparisons between the iconography and the archaeo- logical data promise to shed new light on this topic. The numerous scenes of banqueting in tombs implies that it was a very important facet of the funerary ritual; this study seeks to determine who the real banqueters were. THE LOCRIAN PINAKES AND THE CULT OF APHRO- DITE AND HERMES: Rebecca K. Schindler, Stan- ford University Only three joint cults of Aphrodite and Hermes are commonly known: Samos, Kato Syme, and Megalopolis. A rereading of evidence from the early fifth-century B.C. Locrian pinakes, however, argues for an Aphrodite and Hermes cult at that South Italian polis. Among the pinakes from Persephone's Mannella sanctuary at Locri, three show Aphrodite with her paramour Hermes. These plaques do not conform to the principal narrative se- quence of the pinakes, i.e., the rape and marriage of Perse- phone. Imbued with rich sexual imagery, they indicate that Aphrodite and Hermes were considered a divine couple at Locri-on two examples they are even shown as cult stat- ues. One depicts a temple of mixed Doric and Ionic or- ders, probably representing the sixth-century B.C. temple at Marast, which was associated with Aphrodite's seaside "Stoa ad U" sanctuary. The third plaque depicts Aphrodite in a chariot with Hermes stepping in behind, traditionally interpreted as Hermes leading Aphrodite to the under- world, or as Aphrodite's birth. The scene's upward-moving chariot and the positioning of the figures may, however, instead represent the paired planets Venus and Mercury, astronomically recognizable during the Mediterranean sailing season. The iconography of the pinakes and the sacred topogra- phy of their cult indicate that Aphrodite and Hermes func- tioned as protectors and facilitators of maritime travel and commerce, including perhaps Locri's attested sacred pros- titution. The use of the Ionic order and the existence of an earlier joint cult at Samos suggest introduction to Locri by East Greek merchants. RITUAL ICONOGRAPHY AND ETHNICITY: CERAMIC REMAINS FROM PIZZICA-PANTANELLO (META- PONTO): Kara Nicholas, University of California, Los Angeles The cult of the rural sanctuary at Pizzica-Pantanello, outside the Greek colony of Metapontion in southern Italy, has been interpreted primarily on the evidence of architec- ture and votive terracottas. The relation of the sanctuary's ceramics to its religious rituals has remained largely unex- plored; this may be due to the virtual absence of strictly ritual shapes and of religious scenes on figured vessels. In my exploration of the cultic use of black-glaze ceram- ics at Pizzica-Pantanello, I have turned to images of reli- gious ritual in vase painting for examples of the use of specific forms. The skyphos is the sanctuary's most common ceramic shape from the fifth century B.C. onward. A small group of red-figure vases from Campania depicts the skyphos used to pour libations, rather than the customary phiale. In ad- dition, these scenes consistently represent the participants clothed in native Italian dress, suggesting that this version of the ritual is not Greek but native Italian. Such a reading may affect the interpretation of Pizzica-Pantanello's rituals, the identity of its worshippers, and ultimately its function within the pattern of sacred sites across the Metapontine chora. Rather than serving as an unambiguous symbol of Greek culture among the countryside's mixed population, was the sanctuary a locus for the integration and helleniza- tion of the native Italian population? Strong native influ- ence has already been suggested for the site in the late fourth century on the basis of architectural remains, but the ceramic evidence extends this discussion to the fifth century as well. RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN THE HEEL OF ITALY: THE WORK OF THE SOUTHERN MESSAPIA SURVEY: Duane W Roller Ohio State University Since 1989 an archaeological survey in the heel of Italy has defined a variety of cultural phenomena in this un- usual part of the Mediterranean world. This region is closer to Athens than Rome and long sustained Greek civi- lization, eventually becoming part of the Byzantine em- pire. Even today the Greek language survives in a number of villages. Members of the project identified over 60 sites, from Bronze Age to early modern, and a number of significant conclusions regarding the history of the population can be drawn. Numerous Bronze Age megaliths indicate an early affinity with the western Mediterranean, but Greek settle- ment in the Iron Age shifted the focus east and led to the development of a culture based on cottage industries in well-watered farmsteads surrounding a number of prosper- ous villages. Greek imports became common. Roman con- trol was slight: cities issued their own coins as late as the Augustan period, and the region was never assimilated into the empire. In late antiquity the countryside became depopulated due to frequent barbarian raids. Farms were abandoned; by Byzantine times few people lived outside of fortified villages, a pattern that survives today. In addition to identifying the rural sites that made these conclusions possible, project members the two most signif- icant townsites, Uxentum and Veretum, the former an im- portant regional center, whose fourth-century B.C. walls are a prominent local archaeological feature, and the latter the site of the original Greek settlement of the eighth century B.C. Neither site had ever been systematically surveyed.</page><page sequence="79">1999] THE 100TH ANNUAL MEETING 333 INDEX OF AUTHORS Each author's name is followed by the page number(s) in this issue on which his or her abstract is printed.
