Dead - dead - my Annie - that for ten years was my constant companion, inspiration and ideal - a perfect mother .... Dead - what does it mean?'l The diaries of Dr John William Springthorpe open in 1897 with these words. In all six large volumes, covering the years until 1930, follow. There is an earlier volume, for the years 1883 to 1887, but it has infrequent entries and lapses after a few years. As the opening phrases suggest, these later diaries constitute an unusual record. Page after page, day after day, pained reflections on the death of his wife in childbirth - personal recollections, imagined conversations, remembered dreams, poems, newspaper clippings, photographs and drawings - a melange of texts which comprise a larger record of mourning. In fact there is no other topic for over fifteen years, until a few comments on his war experience intrude into the mourning ritual. These diaries represent an extraordinary and sustained meditation on death: 'my constant upholder, my best inspiration, my own true-hearted pure, whole-souled and absolutely devoted sweetheart and wife . . . what can I say when I think of her loss'.2 In fact he says quite a lot, thousands of words over many years devoted to inscribing its meaning. These reflections, with their mordant sentimentality and stilted profusion of emotion, in many ways seem typical of Victorian mourning.3 What mark them out as unusual are not so much their strength but their duration, pages of almost daily entries, unceasing for almost ten years, tapering off over another five years, with occasional bursts even twenty to thirty years later. Moreover, they stand in marked contrast to the early public announcements, an 1 J. W.

Springthorpe MD'- and there was no funeral notice or bereavement card as was common.4 The disjuncture between private grief and public reticence, however, was overcome in spectacular fashion, a few years later, with the completion of a grand mausoleum for his late wife in Kew Cemetery in Melbourne. It is tempting, then, to see Springthorpe as an instance of pathological mourning. Indeed the length of the mourning process, its intensity and the fact that it was nineteen years before he married again, might situate Springthorpe as one of those 'rare and sad victims of chronic and abnormal grief'.5 It is not surprising that mourning diaries have been read as pathological. Their form as episodic, notational and in these instances endlessly repetitious (almost figurative of Freud's analysis of the death instinct as the capacity to repeat) fosters a sense of pathology. Springthorpe's diary, however, allows us to glimpse formal structures beyond the episodic and repetitious. There are patterns in the writing which suggest that it is not so much disordered, emotional or diseased, but instead a peculiar performance, drawing on a rich repertoire of cultural currents - Romanticism, rationalism, spiritualism, superstition, Buddhism, liberal Protestantism - shaping and rendering explicable intense mourning.6 To read these diaries as merely expressive of some individual pathology is to miss something important about the self- consciousness of this type of writing, even though diaries in their very form would appear to be the genre least amenable to being shaped by broader considerations about a 'whole life'. Such diaries could be both expressive and patterned, and in this way they shaped, transformed and gave meaning to mourning. And these transforming processes were partly individual but also grounded in more general mentalities or forms of collective imagination.7 Moreover, this private grief failed to interrupt a thriving public career. The sharp distinction forged between public and private in this text and lived experience make Springthorpe's diaries an interesting vehicle for exploring patterns of Victorian masculinity. Historians of masculinity and manliness, notably John Tosh, have urged us to see the public and the private spheres as perme- able and interdependent domains, integral to the social order. By the late nineteenth century, however, there seems to have been a shift towards a greater distinction between the public and the private for professional men, with a consequent pull towards a homosocial and imperial world of adventure and manly achievement, and a related denigration of home as routine and feminine.8 4 The Age and the Argus, 25 January 1897. 5 Jalland, op. cit., 338. The arguments about 'pathological mourning' arise from wider psycho- logical theorizing which generally argues this arises when the mourner remains fixed in the phase of numbness, disorganization, yearning and despair, unable to readjust to society.

Australian men were idealized as laconic, practical, bachelors, confronting a hostile environment.9 Springthorpe's diaries and memorialization of his wife affirmed an older faith in the domestic sphere as the seat of a 'true self', and represented a social protest against prevailing codes of colonial masculinity, embroil- ing him in complex class and gender struggles. His mourning provides oblique but interesting ways into key dimensions of Victorian masculinity, suggesting that the general shifts in Victorian culture were more complex and contradictory than revisionist accounts have supposed. J. W. Springthorpe was a significant figure in Australia's emerging professional middle class. Born in Wolverhampton (Staffordshire) in 1855, he migrated with his family to Australia as an infant. Educated at Wesley College and the University of Melbourne, he won a number of prizes and exhibitions, graduating MA, MB, BS in 1879 and MD in I884. His first position was medical officer at the Beechworth Hospital for the Insane and in I88I he travelled to England, becoming the first Australian graduate to be admitted to the Royal College of Physicians. On his return to Melbourne in late 1883 he established a thriving private practice in Collins Street, later becoming a pathologist at the Alfred Hospital, physician at Melbourne Hospital and lecturer in therapeutics, dietetics and hygiene at the University of Melbourne. He received professional honours and responsibilities aplenty - President of the Victorian Branch of the British Medical Association (1891), President of the Hygiene Section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting (1895) and the Australasian Medical Congress (1896) and President of the Melbourne Medical Association (I900). Despite his busy private practice and professional responsibilities he edited the Australasian Medical Gazette (the leading colonial medical journal) for a number of years and wrote over thirty research papers and a two-volume textbook, Therapeutics, Dietetics and Hygiene (1914). In addition, he helped establish the Trained Nurses Association, was Chairman of the Masseur's Registration Board, worked with the Saint John's Ambulance, and was active in the care of epileptics and the insane, mothercraft training, child health and welfare and mental hygiene campaigns.l( Here is a solid and respectable professional career, characteristic of other Australian progres- sives.11 Although in the small and hothouse atmosphere of many of these organizations he inevitably alienated some like-minded reformers, Springthorpe none the less remained a widely respected doctor and social reformer. The range and scope of his activities also point to more 9 There is a very extensive literature on this.

Born and buried a Methodist, he nevertheless lectured to Congrega- tionalist and Anglican 'social questions' groups, urging the cause of medical, social and moral hygiene. He was an avid supporter of Charles Strong, a controversial figure in liberal church circles, who preached the virtues of ecumenical theology and the importance of the Christian social mission.13 For both Strong and Springthorpe, science and religion were not antithetical but complementary, science serving to confirm religion, not as dogma but as an evolving and socially relevant practice. Equally, religion served to justify science as an effort to realize the laws of God's creation and his plan for'man's' destiny. Springthorpe was clearly an earnest and worthy reformer, seemingly certain of his own social mission, unceasing in his efforts, stolid but lively of demeanour (or so his obituarists suggest) and part of that vast army of middle-class reformers, usually unremarkable in person but collec- tively so influential, who did much to change the face of Victorian society. But what of the private man? The intensity and duration of his mourning certainly marks him out as unusual. This impression is reinforced by the changing nature of'death rituals' by the 189os. As many have noted, the high point of the Victorian 'cult of death' was the I85os and by the I88os there was a vigorous and influential middle-class and liberal Christian reform movement urging the simplification of mourning ritual, some even advocating cremation. The consequence was the gradual disappearance, clearly evident by the I890s, of excessive public displays of grief and mourning.14 Springthorpe's mourning ran against the tide, but like so many of his fellow middle-class professional colleagues, he lived the codes of Victorian masculine culture which demanded self-control and public rectitude, allowing him to juggle private despair and public achievement.15 12 Again the literature on Victorian codes of self- control and the work ethic is also extensive. A number of these works draw a useful distinction between 'manliness' as an explicit code of conduct and'masculinity' as the embodiment of these codes. A few illuminating accounts include Tosh, 'What should historians do with masculinity', op. cit., I79-202; J. A. Mangan, Athleticism in the Victorian and Edwardian Public School (Cambridge, 1981); Robert A. Nye, Masculinity and Male Codes of Honor in Modern France (New York, 1993); and John Springhall, Youth, Empire and Society: British Youth Movements, 1883-1940 (London, I977). 13 Threatened with a heresy charge by the Pres- byterian church, Strong resigned to form his own Australian church, attracting many of Melbourne's liberal church elite to his fold. For a brief account of Strong see C. R. Badger,'Charles Strong' in Bede Nairn (ed.), Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol. 6 (Melbourne, 1976), 208-9.

The scales of suffering January 2002 43</page><page sequence="5">II Springthorpe's first diary, the single volume before his mature series, begins in August 1883, when he was twenty-eight. At the time he was in England furthering his studies, although his return to Australia was only a few months away. Its purpose is clear: I have long wanted some such thing - not to jot down failures or to rail against myself - but to keep myself in self-communion. I find meditation becomes reverie unless I have someone to talk to or confide in. I want this to supply that want. Here I want to talk to myself... and for this I must try to banish self-consciousness - and be perfectly true and honest with myself.16 Springthorpe's reasons for writing a diary were not uncommon. Journals, memoirs, diaries and autobiographies became an important part of new technologies of the self emerging in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, marking the emergence of possessive individualist subjectivities.17 The nature, origin and particular rhetorical strategies of these forms of writing have been the focus of much critical historical investigation, and these analyses provide essential caveats for the use of Springthorpe's text. It clearly is not a privileged site for historical truth but a text in which a self is invented. Moreover, what distinguishes the diary from other means for inventing the self, such as the autobiography, is the lack of narrative closure. Diaries are usually a series of repetitive representations of the self rather than a retrospective narrative that orders the self in a teleological structure. As Felicity Nussbaum has argued, the diary is not a classical realist text but a journal of existence, in this way both producing and reflecting individuals who believe they are the centre and source of meaning.18 This meaning was an imagined'truth' of the self, a 'reality' for the private self in opposition to the 'social perform- ances' required of the public self. The diary was a daily monitor of one's success in maintain- ing the integrity of the private self, not a map of its inevitable triumph (or failure). Springthorpe's desire to use his diary as a means of self-government was conventional, but there are other aspects of his diary that were unusual. As a number of scholars have argued, by the nineteenth century the private diary was largely the preserve of middle-class women and although women's diaries were characterized by tensions between the writing of a private self and a desire for a public record, men were increasingly inclined to publish their autobiogra- phies, travel journals and diaries, rendering them as public documents.19 This performative 16 Springthorpe Diaries, 25 August 1883. 17 For the relevant arguments about the nature of self-representation in diaries and autobiographies, and the differences between them, see Regina Gagnier, Subjectivities:A History of Self-Representation in Britain 1832-1920 (Oxford, 1991); Felicity A.

I</page><page sequence="6">mode suggests a retreat from the idea of a private self or at least its sublimation in preference to a public record of masculine achievement; a sense perhaps that the increasing codification of a 'muscular Christian' ethos inhibited the invention and expression of a potentially disruptive private self.20 Springthorpe held no such reserve, preferring the locked and private diary, even if expensively bound, as the means of self-expression. More than this, Springthorpe hoped that the diary would be a partner in an internal dialogue -'someone to talk to and confide in'. This comment is that of a lonely young man far from companions and family, but it is also a clue to his sense that an 'other' was vital for the formation of self. Far from being a means of constructing a private self away from the chaos of social intercourse, for Springthorpe the diary was a means of creating and engaging with society. In it he could re-create those social dialogues that helped form the boundaries of his self, allowing the diary to be his 'mirror'. Thus the diary was not a respite from the public world but an utterly social site. The entries in Springthorpe's first youthful diary are a series of moral and spiritual aspir- ations as well as confession and self-admonishment for his failures, conventional forms of Victorian masculine self-government.21 Statements such as 'I try to make my life Christ-like' or 'I want my life to be first true and then earnest in myself' are quickly followed by 'I have been wandering away from spiritual things' or 'I have been nearer actively impure than previ- ously in my history'. Much of it is a discourse on the tension between his'animal appetites and passions', admittedly 'constitutionally strong as they are in men', and his concern with moral restraint; his appetites 'utterly checked for twelve months'. But the entries are far from frequent, suggesting that the battle between appetites and morality was by no means one-sided or as tortuous as some of his admonishments imply. Moreover, they are less than the frank confessions expected of a private record. There are veiled hints of 'impurity', 'falling off', 'unworthiness' and a 'lack of constancy', which preface his resolve to be pure in the future, and point to occasional 'indulgence' in the periods between his diary entries.22 But the details of these 'failings' are not recorded, pointing to the narcissistic functions of the journal; in seeing the diary as a mirror, Springthorpe sought to mist over the darker images. These personal reflections took on new meaning in I885 and I886 during the period of his courtship of Annie Constance Inglis, a woman of eighteen, twelve years younger than Springthorpe. In the diary he begins to chart the course of their courtship and his confessions and admonishments are now centred on his worthiness for marriage and earnest protestations of his love. His sense of unworthiness is exacerbated by the fact that he was engaged to another woman and one of his close friends had expressed a keen interest in Annie.23 There were social risks involved in breaking off one engagement and undermining another man's chances, but convention was flouted because Annie embodied his ideal of the perfect woman and wife. 20 On the retreat of some Victorians from self- in addition to those already cited, see Peter absorption see Gagnier, op. cit., 239.

January 2002 The scales of suffering 45</page><page sequence="7">Like many Victorian contemporaries his desire was shaped by the 'naturalness' of the distinct 'characters' and 'capacities' of the sexes.24 In his different moments of expectant lover, mourning husband and scholar, Springthorpe praised the distinctive virtues of'woman'. In the course of their relationship we can also map a shift in the anthropology of their union - from one between different but complementary natures to a more overtly patriarchal and patronizing sense of her as sister, child and mother. In 1884, in a lecture 'A Perfect Woman', read before the Melbourne Shakespeare Society, he claimed that 'woman is a compound of sweet essences - beauty, modesty, tenderness, grace, sweetness, self-sacrifice and tact', she must be both 'womanly and wise' and her true mission was'helpmate of man'. By these criteria the most'noble' of Shakespeare's women was Rosalind. These conventional rhapsodies on the nature of'woman' were echoed in the diaries. But there are other virtues necessary for'woman'. For the scholar, women must'retain the womanly while acquiring the intellectual' and although he qualifies this with the claim that for him the womanly intellectual should have 'wisdom rather than knowledge and charm rather than logic' there is sense that the ideal woman should have a measure of intelligence. In the diaries he remarks on Annie's self-reliance and individuality, and while these are threatening qualities they are also attractive ones. There are tensions here between the ideal of female charms and their capacity for individuality and wisdom, between their otherness and their sameness, and in the interstices of these tensions lay Springthorpe's desire.25 Many of these claims about the nature and capacities of'woman' bear a striking resemblance to such classic Victorian texts on the distinctive characters of the sexes as Ruskin's 'Of Queen's Gardens' and the poems of Tennyson.26 These Romantic and Victorian notions of the 'perfect woman' were embedded in a larger middle-class culture which embraced the 'helpmate' ideal. Historians have charted the prevalence of the ideal of companionate marriage in Victorian culture, tracing its lineage back to chivalrous conventions, and ideas of sensibility and domesticity emerging in the eighteenth century. Middle-class women ideally supported and sustained the 'public' face of men, but the companionate ideal often made men more, not less, 24 The literature on the separate spheres is also vast.

In public he saw'womanhood's excellencies' contributing to 'man's possibilities' and in private he saw his forthcoming union with Annie as'my salvation, my purification, my ennoblement, my rescue from self'.28 It is here that we can glimpse a deeper sense to the 'helpmate' ideal, as the crucial means for achieving manhood, with all its Victorian connotations of manliness, chivalry, self-control and patriarchal authority. Woman became the means for making the male self, rendering the diary unnecessary. Springthorpe's early enthusiasm for the 'helpmate' ideal, however, undergoes a subtle shift in emphasis in his later reflections (after her death) on his 'ideal' wife. His memorial poem,'In Memoriam', with its echoes of Tennyson's influential consolation on the possibility of life after death, praises'a maiden, not too bright or good','a phantom of delight ... to haunt, to startle and waylay'.29 There is an undoubted consistency between the youthful lover's and the middle- aged widower's sense of the virtues of women, but in the latter there is a discernible decline in desire for womanly intelligence and independence. In fact Springthorpe seems to have lost his youthful enthusiasm for a partnership of different but equal people, stressing a more conventional ideal of a wife as someone to support, delight and complement male subjectivity. He seems to have embraced, more fully than before, widespread Victorian ideals of compan- ionate marriage, with their complex and contradictory imperatives towards partnership and subordination.30 Now a 'perfect woman [was] nobly planned to warm, to comfort and to command'.31 In his intense private musing after his bereavement there has also been a marked shift in the tenor of the relationship; from two people of different qualities enhancing each other to a sense of her'girlish delight', her'sisterly affection' and her virtue as a mother.32 Rather than separate spheres and companionate marriage being monolithic cultural discourses, the shifts in Springthorpe's attitudes indicate some of the ways particular marriages embodied and lived Victorian ideals and how these could evolve during the course of the union. These changes were to come. In January 1887 Springthorpe and Annie were married and 27 See Leonore Davidoff and Catherine Hall, Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780-1850 (London, 1987) and Mark Girouard, The Return to Camelot: Chivalry and the English Gentleman (New Haven, 1981).

James Hammerton, Cruelty and Com- panionship: Conflict in Nineteenth Century Married Life (London, 1992). Carnes and Griffin argue that the companionate ideal was rare before 1900, but this seems to be more appropriate to the American context. See Carnes and Griffin, Meanings for Manhood, op. cit., 81-2. In Britain the idea of partnership and companionship has a longer lineage, back to at least the late eighteenth century. See, for example, G. J. Barker-Benfield, The Culture of Sensibility: Sex and Society in Eighteenth-Century Britain (Chicago, 1992); Randolf Trumbach, The Rise of the Egalitarian Family:Aristocratic Kinship and Domestic Relations in Eighteenth Century England (New York, 1978); and Randolf Trumbach, Sex and the Gender Revolution Volume One: Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London (Chicago, 1998). 28 Springthorpe, 'A Perfect Woman', 4 and Springthorpe Diaries, 28 May I886. 29 J.

He was characteristically both frank and coyly reticent in his account. The incubus of the future union, as a father-daughter relationship, was already apparent in his delight in reading her novels, she 'listening beautifully'. But she also affirms his masculinity by 'looking happier than ever before', being unafraid 'of showing that she loves men'. After breakfast they 'have a morning's love-making' but 'what she said I won't repeat', 'if only you could see Annie putting a tuck in my shirt'.33 Here was Springthorpe's most explicit address to an audience. The diary, far from being a mere record, was a performance, an address to some other. Marriage, however, healed this divided self, creating a completeness that required no dialogue to comprehend itself. Marriage removed the necessity to write. There were no further entries in the diary except for brief notations on the birth and death of children, three of the four children born to them surviving to adulthood. The death of his wife in January I897 created the demand to write again. III The tenor of Springthorpe's diary of mourning has been glimpsed, but the intensity and duration of these reflections are difficult to grasp at such a distance. Two years after his wife's death he was still filling his diary with 'Oh sweet, sweet, sweet, how your loss pains'. Two years later he cried out'Death! Death! How much greater are the dead than the living- in all respects.' In July 1903 he reflected: 'It is now six and a half years after your disappearance - the old sweet- ness still lingers on ... memories - innumerable and holy throng in.' And so it continues. In April I906 he wrote'the only one who understood me - and loved me through it... my sweet now vanished almost ten years. Oh! how I miss her.' Even twenty-six years after the tragic event, on the anniversary of her death, he could still write 'what a blow . . . never forgotten since'.34 In fact from I897 until 1914 the diary is not a strict record of existence but a register of grief and mourning. Springthorpe clearly wants us to see mourning as the sum total of his private self, with every entry about Annie's death. Springthorpe might appear to be suffering from'pathological mourning', and by any reason- able account Springthorpe's protracted mourning was unusual. But the question of its pathol- ogy is more problematic than the duration of the mourning might suggest. Far from grief inhibiting his activity Springthorpe takes up his pen and begins to write lengthy accounts of his feelings almost immediately. Within a few months he wrote and produced the elaborate case-bound'In Memoriam' book, complete with poems, reminiscences, photographs and repro- ductions of Rossetti's painting'Dante's Dream', and before a year is out he had begun plans for her memorial. Moreover, although there does appear to be some pause in his public activity in the late I89os, particularly the publication of medical research, he continues to go to work, although he professes no interest in it, and by I900 is again taking on new reform and professional responsibilities.35 The interruption that mourning caused in his activity and career was far less than its duration. This may represent successful male sublimation, and it does, but it runs against the grain of his journal, pointing once again to Springthorpe's capacity to use 33 ibid.,27 January 1887-6 February 1887.

His grief is given expression through descriptions of daily events, memories, poems, dreams, conversations and visual images. He acknowledges his loss frequently; Annie was the most wonderful companion, wife and mother, the only woman who understood him and her loss is irreparable. Sometimes this idealization takes on bizarre visual forms. At a number of places in the diaries Springthorpe pasted in small reproductions of paintings of Joan of Arc, or Guine- vere accompanied by Lancelot (Springthorpe and Annie's house was called Camelot), or pictures of wood nymphs, and in each case he has cut out the face of Annie from a family photograph and pasted it over the face of the woman in the painting.36 Here we can glimpse some of the complex cultural currents in Springthorpe's mourning. His frequent recourse to images of Joan of Arc conjures images of Annie as noble martyr to a greater cause (although whether this was merely his marriage, love as an abstract or the perpetuation of the lineage through birth is unclear).Wood nymphs suggest recourse to bucolic romantic images of'natural' innocence, or might indicate darker themes of magical spirits and the power of nature. The most important cultural influence, however, seems to be Tennyson. This is apparent in Spring- thorpe's allusion in his memorial book to Tennyson's 'In Memoriam', with its hopeful message of immortality of the spirit, something that appealed directly to Springthorpe's liberal Protes- tantism. More interesting are the echoes of Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King', through the frequent deployment of images and references to Lancelot and Guinevere. Here Springthorpe seems to be struggling to represent his union as a supreme but guilty love, brought to a tragic end. Rather than seeing himself as Arthur, Springthorpe seems to suggest that he is the true but guilty lover, betrayed by fate and sin. How this tapped into deeper feelings about his marriage is unclear but it suggests a tortured, romantic and tragic sensibility, and perhaps a sense that past wrongs (the fraught circumstances of their courtship, perhaps) or deep pleasures have to be punished in the end. Perhaps there is also a hint here that guilt and pleasure were intertwined, awaiting fate to extract an appropriate price for transcendent love. These things cannot be pinned down with any certainty in such a complex text but there are enough hints and cultural references to point to some of the sources that inspired Springthorpe's specific representations of love. Despite Springthorpe's pre-eminence as a professional and a rational man of science, his visual and written vocabulary came from deeper romantic and emotional imaginings.37 36 Springthorpe Diaries, 26 February 1897, 14 February 1899, 17 June 1900. 37 Tennyson is a contested figure in modern scholarship. He has been seen as conservative, radical, romantic, Victorian and proto-modern. There are ways in which he developed a variety of major traditions within Victorian culture over a long career. Springthorpe, in his own private writ- ings, seems to respond most directly to the roman- tic and Victorian elements of Tennyson.

I These rich cultural allusions, however, are often undercut by a rather shallow, although under- standable, narcissistic dimension to his ruminations. He bemoans at length the consequences of Annie's death; the loneliness and meaninglessness of life, his 'vegetative life', without her. As she had been the means for his sense of completeness, her death fractured his self and writing was an effort to sustain himself. This is most apparent in his reminiscences of the past; their times of domestic happiness and shared pleasures. Soon after Annie's death he recalls their first meetings and courtship, glossing over the feelings of guilt and unworthiness that dominated his contemporary diary entries.38 But he continues sporadically to recall incidents and feelings throughout the following years. These memories obscure the boundary between past and present and allow a momentary healing reverie. But Springthorpe's romantic sentiments about the tragic consequences of guilt and ecstasy had deep roots in his life. This is most apparent in his dream work, which was fraught with tension and anxiety. In one he dreamt that to save her life Annie had to marry Fred (the man who had been courting her when Springthorpe sought her hand).39 It is a risky enterprise attempting to interpret dreams at such a distance (though difficult to resist), without access to the individual associations so central to dream analysis, but the dream seems to suggest an unconscious wish to escape mourning by constructing a dramaturgy involving her marriage to someone else. Other dreams contained a more frank erotic element, with references to 'loaded white guns', although even here there were anxious moments, when Annie replies to his proposal of marriage,'Don't be in such a hurry'.4" The phallic sense of the 'loaded white gun' seems clear, but the hint of delayed fulfilment undercuts the pleasure of the dream. In much of his dream work Springthorpe seems to be disentangling the knots of desire. In another dream he calls his wife 'Playfair Peggie', and by 1904 he has a series of dreams where he proposes marriage to Annie and then panics because he remembers that he is already married.41 This anxiety is resolved when he realizes that Annie and his previous wife are one and the same, but the play of wishing around a second marriage is a strong element in these dreams. Although his unconscious seems to be negotiating the work of disengagement, Springthorpe remains firm in his commitment to the 'everlasting' nature of their love. In memory, dream, poem, memorial and picture he seeks to maintain her presence in his life. But there was a much more direct sense in which Springthorpe sustained his marriage. He believed that his wife was actively present in his day-to-day existence. The emergence in the nineteenth century of a sense of continuity between the 'real' world and the afterlife has been the focus of considerable historical investigation. Diverse cultural currents, ranging from the decline in theological and popular beliefs in hell, the rise of romantic conceptions of the vital force of nature, Tennyson's faith in an afterlife, scientific naturalism and the increasing interest in Indian mysticism, contributed to the belief that with death the spirit continued, in corporeal form, for eternity.42 This was fruitful terrain for the growth of a small but influential spiritualist movement that 38 Springthorpe Diaries, 26 February 1897.

Spiritualism and alternative religious movements, such as theosophy, were active in late nineteenth-century Australia.43 Sentimental theologies of the afterlife and popular spiritu- alism have been seen as part of an attempt by women to assert cultural power. Heaven became a continuation and glorification of the domestic sphere and equally women, because they were closer to nature, were seen as more capable of communicating with spirits.44 Nevertheless, many men were active believers in spiritualist ideas and Springthorpe was undoubtedly aware of these currents of thought. But his attempts to put these ideas into practice were marked by doubt, frustration and conflict. With his gradual abandonment of mourning his theological under- standing of immortality underwent significant change. As an active liberal churchgoer he worked and reworked the prevailing arguments concern- ing immortality, eternity, salvation and resurrection in an effort to convince himself that his 'love' would continue in some fashion. Within a month of Annie's death he declared: 'Who can thus limit us when freed from the limitations of the body.... There is then a personal future - But what is it?'45 This sense of faith and doubt marked all his musing on the possi- bility of an afterlife. In 1898 he wondered about the resurrection of the body: 'What does it imply, what does it mean?' A few years later he maintained that: 'I hope and believe there is an eternal goodness there as well as here and that there is a divine far off waiting for me'.46 Only by sustaining himself with such a vision could Springthorpe hope to 'meet' Annie again. In discussing the plans for his memorial he argued his preference for a four-sided temple because of its signification of a deeper story of spiritual progress, from loss to memory to separation and finally to reunion. But edging around these declarations of faith were uncomfortable doubts -'what is it','who can know','where','why'- which threatened his faith, convincing him of the insignificance of 'man' in the universe, making him anxious for a sign of the truth, some affirmation of faith and divine purpose, some communication from Annie.47 In his daily existence Springthorpe searched for some direct spiritual contact. He negotiated his doubts but also attempted to conjure her presence. There were two main forms of address to Annie in his diary. The first was to write directly to her, using the present tense, to mask the sense of her absence. He wrote to 'Mumpie' (presumably his term of affection), describing recent events that might be of interest to her. He discussed how the children were faring at school, the state of the garden, trips he had undertaken, people they knew and significant politi- cal events, such as the death of Queen Victoria. Also he wrote to reassure her of his undying love: 'Mumpie, though there has been much to distract ... throughout all, my lost sweetheart ... [you are] still the sweetest, dearest, present recollection'.48 The act of writing, then, became a means of reifying Annie's spirit, making it a tangible and present force in his life. 43 Prominent citizens such as former Chief 44 See Ann Douglas,'Heaven our home: con- Justice of New South Wales, William Charles solation literature in the northern United States Windeyer, future Prime Minister Alfred Deakin I83-80' in Stannard, op. cit., 49-68 and Owen, op. and leading feminist, Rose Scott, attended seances cit.

I These attempts to write Annie's existence were continually undercut, however, by his second mode of address. Throughout the diaries he attempts to summon her presence, but each attempt is marked by failure. He entreats her to return, putting his faith to the test: 'Ah sweet, sweet, sweet - I have prepared the garden and planted it with trees and all the flowers that you loved. Will you come Love? Will you come? Here I am. Here I am'.49 Here the changing tense (past and present) betrays his doubts and confusions. With time these doubts become more apparent: '[I] feel my best self only when looking skyward ... once again my final cry is to hear from beyond the vale' and a week later,'the vast deep makes no response and all is farther away than it was while the Gracious Presence is unfelt'.50 But he found no comfort in spiritualism:'I have had no knowledge or communication, though certainly I have not had the "letting-go" of a Lodge or Conan-Doyle'.51 His failure to communicate fostered scepticism and a reworking of his theological understandings of life after death. In that year he expresses his first doubts about the survival of the soul in corporeal form - raising the possibility that she has'metamorphosed' into some other form. His scientific background also begins to influence his understanding of the spirit. He talks of people as insignificant 'reasoning germs' and wonders whether all his spiritual longing is but an effect of'the brain cortex'.52 But he does not abandon his faith for science, although he constantly despairs that he knows only of matter rather than the spirit. Instead he comes to a new theological position. By 1904, although not fully realized or argued, Springthorpe seems to conceive of the soul as immortal but not in anthropomorphic form, rather as infinitesimal spiritual particles ever present but dispersed throughout the universe - present but unable to communicate. The diary was largely a private record, despite its subsequent donation to the state's library. But Springthorpe gave a very public performance of his grief through the elaborate memorial to his wife, completed in I90I at a cost of more than /Io,ooo. It was a four-fronted Greek temple-style monument in imported Carrara marble, with ten-foot high dark green granite Doric columns, a tiled royal blue and malachite floor, a cathedral dome in ruby red glass, and the statements 'Light Evermore, Love Evermore, Life Evermore, Peace Evermore' carved into the pediments. Inside was a statuary group of three figures carved by noted sculptor Sir Bertram Mackennal - a recumbent woman 'sweetly sleeping', at her feet a figure of 'Grief' with an unstrung lute dropped to the ground and at the head of the woman an 'angel stretching out his hand to place a wreath of everlasting flowers upon her peaceful brow'. By Victorian stan- dards this memorial was remarkable for its size and elaborate decoration, reminiscent of Queen Victoria's Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens.53 It has an interesting relationship to the diary. The memorial was shorn of the guilt, doubts, ambivalence and religious questioning that troubled the private writings. The public display fostered the presentation of an idealized woman and a deep and abiding love. A memorial performance demanded a clear and unequiv- ocal statement that articulated acceptable sentiments. In the private domain Springthorpe was able to explore more complex emotions and feelings, ones essential to the overcoming of his grief but impossible to convey in a public space. 49 ibid., I5 September 900o. public memorialization, and for more detail on the 50 ibid., I5 January I908 and 23 January I908. memorial, its function and reception see Jalland, 51 ibid., 23 January 1923.

Although the memorial was generally praised by the colonial press, it quickly became known as Melbourne's 'Taj Mahal'.54 This term was riddled with ambivalence. Signifying a deep and abiding love, it also conjured up images of eastern potentates, excess, extravagance and superi- ority. This ran against the tenor of Victorian mourning. More significantly, it challenged colonial ideals of class and masculinity. In Australia class, gentility and respectability were more fragile than at 'home'. Class boundaries were more fluid, and in the colonies the 'nouveau' were numerous, significant and more likely to mix in 'the best circles', often to the embarrassment of those from more established lineages. Moreover, manliness in Australia was much more a working-class and egalitarian ideal than in England. This blurred the class distinctions between men. As a consequence, class distinctions, and codes of respectability and gentility within the Melbourne State Library, to Anon, 24 January I966, La Trobe Library Files,'Springthorpe Memorial'. 54 The history of the memorial as the'Taj Mahal' is from T.

Springthorpe saw this memorial as his chief form of consolation.57 It seems to have been a significant component of his grieving process, one that gradually eased his adjustment to his wife's death. But although it hid more complex feelings and did not solve the burden of contemplation and reunion, the memorial was also a challenge to masculine codes of accept- able behaviour. In asserting the importance of feelings and emotions, such as love and grief, the memorial deliberately flouted Victorian rectitude in matters of death, and more forcefully refuted colonial ideals of egalitarian, manly fortitude. In publicly announcing the importance of the private sphere, Springthorpe was flouting masculine conventions. In one sense his grieving harked back to some of the agonistic relations between nature and culture that were at the core of Victorian liberalism. Men had to overcome their appetites, their animal natures, in order to gain self-control and a sense of the civilized self. The cultivation of these attributes required complex intersections between the public and the private self. But as Tosh has force- fully argued, the sense of struggle within liberalism was increasingly externalized in the late nineteenth century. What was to be overcome was outside the self - an exotic 'other' - lands, climates, peoples that required incorporation into the empire. And this task required manly attributes and self-sacrifice, more so on the frontier than in the metropolitan centre. Spring- thorpe, however, forcefully asserted the affective, emotional elements of liberalism, sentiments that placed him outside colonial masculine codes. The sense of class ridicule uneasily edging around the reactions to the memorial points to the fact that Springthorpe's memorial was an unsettling presence in colonial culture. IV Springthorpe's mourning offers a rare insight into the tensions between the public and the private male self at a time when the codes of Victorian masculinity were focused on the rigorous 55 On the role of women in maintaining social codes and social status see Beverley Kingston, My Wife, My Daughter and Poor Mary Ann: Women And Work in Australia (Melbourne, 1975), 6-28 and Oxford History ofAustralia, volume III: Glad, Confident Morning 1860-1900 (Melbourne, 1988), 277-83.

See also Marilyn Lake,'Socialism and manhood', op. cit., 54-62. Some historians, however, have contested the extent of this masculinism, at least within the working class, and questioned its consequences for women, arguing that the sex imbalance in the population made women more highly prized.

Social History 54 VOL. 27 : NO. I</page><page sequence="16">presentation of a controlled and ordered self. The preference for the published autobiographical narrative in the late Victorian period worked to represent a unified self that was largely public. Springthorpe's diaries are just one piece of evidence, among many, pointing to fractures in these masculine codes of public fortitude, discipline and training. And although there seems, as Tosh argues, to have been a 'flight from domesticity' in the late Victorian era, Springthorpe's diaries demonstrate that many men still sustained their masculinity through an ordered and affirming private sphere. Family was still central to the formation of a strong public self for many men, particularly those who chose marriage in preference to the growing popularity of bachelor and club life.58 When private foundations collapsed for such men, the 'essence' of the public man was threatened. The diary was a form of private reconciliation for Springthorpe, a means of shoring up the public man by writing a world of mourning which gave his life its bearings through its echo of the world of the paterfamilias that had been his lot and was now lost. It also provided a means for healing the rupture between public and private occasioned by Annie's death. Here the mourning performance was far from pathological. In fact it sustained the public self for Springthorpe. Much of Springthorpe's diary, in its intricate maintenance of the presence of Annie, seems to be a refusal to accept his loss. But through the act of narrating his religious doubt, the failure of his efforts to communicate with Annie and his ambiguous dreams, Springthorpe appears to be undertaking the vital psychic work of disengaging himself from his grief. These efforts are protracted and by no means linear in their progression towards this end, but one final factor seems to tip the balance in favour of a break with the mourning process, a break that enables him to marry again in 1916. Of course the signs of a break have been apparent for a few years. Increasing doubts about communication and anxious dreams are obvious clues. More signifi- cant perhaps is Springthorpe's diary itself. After 1904 the entries become less frequent and shorter. But the crucial juncture seems to be January/February 1907, almost ten years to the day after Annie's death. On this anniversary of her death he reflects on the symmetry in his life -'ten years' absence after ten years' companionship'.59 In these and other comments he implies that he had to suffer in equal measure to his happiness, that there was some ultimate calculus of pleasure and pain. A few months after this anniversary there is an unprecedented break of nine months in the diary. He picks up his pen again early in I908, but then there is a further break of eighteen months from August I908 to March I910. Thereafter the entries become more sporadic. Having suffered for ten years, after ten years of happiness, Springthorpe seems released from his burden. This sense of a final evening of the scales of pleasure and suffering is so actively lived in his diaries it seems almost to have shaped the actuality of his mourning. This concern with the scales of suffering had diverse sources. In part it emerged out of debates in medical science. A sense of the need to balance life, to strike an accord between the faculties, and between physical and mental work, was related to the fundamental problem of excess for Victorians. In his published writings and his medical practice Springthorpe, like many of his contemporaries, was vitally interested in the problems of excessive concentration 58 For the broader dimensions of these develop- structing Brotherhood: Class, Gender and Fraternalism ments see John Tosh, A Man's Place, op. cit., 145-94 (Princeton, 1989); and Eve Sedgwick, Between Men: and'What should historians do with masculinity?', English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire (New op. cit., 183-9; Carnes, Secret Ritual and Manhood in York, 1985).

Drawing on the influential work of such medical theorists as Henry Maudsley, many Victorians, especially professionals and men of science like Springthorpe, saw self-indulgence and excess of animal appetite as a descent into barbarism.60 In contrast, control and self-denial were the hallmark of civilization. But this could go too far. The excitements of civilization increased nervous disorders. These problems were in part elaborations of an older concern with the relations between mind and body. But it is one that takes on a certain urgency in Victorian medical science. For doctors like Springthorpe there were pervasive fears that civilization was cultivating the mind at the expense of the body, while savagery did the opposite. The consequence of these 'imbalances' was decline and decay. This was not merely abstract theory. Springthorpe actively embraced such doctrines in wrestling with his own personal dilemmas. In his early diary it is the fear of indulgence and excess (of animal appetites) that his writing monitors and guards against. Later he is worried that morbid reflection, and obsessive involvement in his work, are threatening his constitution. It was excess or a compulsive absorption in one capacity, thought or desire that seemed most unsettling. What was required was an equal cultivation of both mind and body. For Spring- thorpe and others a healthy body meant a sound mind, but equally a fit mind ensured a sound body.61 These were pervasive themes in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century psychological medicine. But Springthorpe also had an unusual preoccupation with the psychological aspects of disease. He was aware of the work of Lombroso, Galton, Krafft-Ebing and other theorists of degeneracy. As a medical practitioner he was sympathetic to somatic theories of mental illness, argued forcefully by such eminent alienists as Henry Maudsley and Charles Bucknill. But while most of his contemporaries were attempting to expand the domain of physical theories of mental disturbance and ideas of hereditary degeneracy, Springthorpe always retained a central role for psychological factors.62 By the early decades of the twentieth century he was part of a small group of colonial doctors sympathetic to Charcot, Weir Mitchell and other theorists of psychological dimensions to mental phenomena. He was also one of the few sympathetic commentators on Freud's theories (prior to I914), although like his fellow-travellers he seemed to prefer the quicker therapeutic results of hypnosis and suggestion.63 Just before the Great War Bergsonian vitalism added a further dimension to his understanding of the nervous system and diseases of the mind. The body and the mind were animated by energies exploding or dissipating according to the actions of the nerve cells, and the disposition of the nerves was affected as much by psychological as physical conditions. For Springthorpe, psycho- logical maladjustment and fixations could affect the bodily constitution, just as physical conditions could shape psychological manifestations. It was essential, then, to ensure a balance 60 For Henry Maudsley's very influential study 62 ibid. See also J.

Excesses of either mental or physical stimulation could either unsettle or dissipate the vital energies generated within the nervous system leading to illness, degeneracy or madness.64 Perhaps this explains his vigorous work routine during his time of mourning. It was this that allowed him to'indulge' his grief. But these scientific preoccupations, important as they are, seem too abstract and arid to explain Springthorpe's intense investment in mourning and his equally sudden abandonment of the journal after a decade of obsessive writing. In the journal we can glimpse other factors shaping his suffering. For him it was not merely a problem of energies, although it seems clear that he understood his suffering as partly the effect of grief upon his nervous constitution. Although he sought the scientific foundations for such theories, his inspiration was as much literary and spiritual as medical. Drawing on writers such as Zola, himself an eager participant in French 'spiritism', Springthorpe was convinced that material science was never sufficient to encompass the 'mystery of life'.65 This sense of a greater mystery in life had religious sources, as we have seen, but there is something more mundane in Springthorpe's sense that ten years' mourning was enough. There is a strong undercurrent of superstition about the happiness of his married life. Superstition was on the decline in the Victorian world, especially among the professional middle classes, but Springthorpe's romantic imaginings in his journal still toyed with images of nymphs, magic, mystery and fate.66 And although there were no specific super- stitions informing the length of mourning necessary to appease 'fate', Springthorpe suggests time and again that his marriage had obviously been too contented and fulfilling. Existence inevitably delivered, he seems to suggest, an equal quantum of happiness and unhappiness; having enjoyed ten years of married pleasure it was only right that he experience a similar period of mournful suffering. This may explain why Springthorpe waited nearly another ten years before marrying the daughter of his housekeeper. Did he wish to have a further ten years of suffering to ensure a period of happiness after a second marriage? The journals are silent on this theme but the timing is striking. An evening of the scales was clearly a trope that Springthorpe played with in his journal. Something had to restore balance, and this could only be achieved by an equal measure of suffering. The most likely source of inspiration, however, was eastern religion. Colonial Australia was very alive to the richness of eastern ideas and culture. There had been strong political and institutional ties between India and Australia until 1857 (the early Australian colonies had in fact been part of the Archdiocese of Calcutta for many years), and throughout the nineteenth century trade and commerce kept the two in close contact. Prominent 64 Such ideas are present in some of Spring- Illness and American Society 1875-1940 (Princeton, thorpe's writings already cited.

More than once he writes of a wheel revolving on the pathway to the stars. After his own death in 1933 a bas relief,'The Wheel of Life', was added to his wife's memorial, depicting an aged Tibetan lama, seated on the bank of the river of peace after a long journey.68 This mystical, perhaps superstitious, sense of completion, of having evened the scales of happiness and unhappiness after ten years, appears to be the final break for Springthorpe. How else can we explain the almost casual sense in which he seems released from his burden on the tenth anniversary of Annie's death? And here we can see that the diary has shifted in its purpose; from a site for governing the self to a calendar in which he ticks off the days of his penance. After ten years he feels free to move on. He still occasionally reflects on his grief, but the diary entries become more infrequent and increasingly focused on his public life. In I909 he finally moved to a new home (oyous Gard), where 'you are not ... it knows you not and you ... know it not', Lancelot at last reconciled to being without his Guinevere.69 University of Sydney 67 For an interesting analysis of the complex relations between Australia and Asia in this period see David Walker, Anxious Nation: Australia and the Rise of Asia 185o-1939 (St Lucia, 1999), I3-97.
