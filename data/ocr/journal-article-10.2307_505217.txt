<plain_text><page sequence="1">Survey of Archaeological Research on Tartessos* JAVIER G. CHAMORRO Abstract In this paper a synthesis of Spanish archaeological stu- dies and excavation reports providing evidence for the famed Tartessos is presented. In contrast to earlier inves- tigations based solely on philological sources, the problem of Tartessos is examined from an archaeological point of view, summarizing research conducted systematically over the past 25 years. The archaeological materials in- vestigated in Portugal and Spain allow the reconstruction of the problematic pre-Colonial Late Bronze Age Phase (900-750 B.C.) and the much better known Orientaliz- ing Phase (750-550 B.C.). The trade routes established by Phoenicians and Greeks within the Iberian Peninsula and across the Mediterranean present Tartessos as an El Dorado of early commerce. The accumulation of silver necessary for the develop- ment of coinage in the Central and Eastern Mediterrane- an may have had its origin in the silver mines of Huelva in Spain where important metallurgical activity is veri- fied from the ninth century B.C. onwards. The oldest epi- graphic alphabet in the Iberian Peninsula is reviewed within the context of Tartessian necropoli excavated in southern Portugal. Stelae with engraved Herzsprung shields, indicating elements of Tartessian funerary ritual, are also discussed. The recent discovery of fine Greek ware dated from 600-550 B.C. supports the identification of ancient Tartessos with the modern city of Huelva. Ever since 1922, when Adolf Schulten collected and studied the ancient texts relating to the city called Tar- tessos in Classical literature and Tarshish in the Bi- ble,' scholars have sought to locate the fabled city re- nowned for its wealth and its mines.2 Tartessos is mentioned by, i.a., Herodotus (4.152), Strabo (3.2.13), and the elder Pliny (HN 4.120), and de- scribed by the fourth-century A.C. poet Avienus in his Ora Maritima (179, 223, 423, 463). Modern attempts to pinpoint the site of Tartessos have focused on Anda- lusia in southern Spain. When Schulten died in 1960, he still believed that, on the basis of the ancient texts, the only possible location of the city was west of the Guadalquivir River, inside the present-day bird sanc- tuary of Dofiana. A new era in the search for Tartessos began when a magnificent gold treasure was found at El Carambolo, 3 km. west of Seville, on 30 September 1958.3 Since then a series of important excavations in western Andalusia have uncovered significant ma- terial evidence that has allowed archaeologists to veri- fy the wealth and wide trading contacts of Tartessos during the first millennium B.C. and to identify the site with the modern city of Huelva.

THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROBLEM OF TARTESSOS The Tartessian epoch marks the rise of maritime commerce throughout the Mediterranean. For the first time, sailors from the East were able to cross the Pillars of Hercules on a regular basis, and venture in- to the unknown; increasingly seaworthy vessels as- sured safe return to the Aegean, Canaan, or Egypt. The improved means of transport available in the first millennium B.C. increased the feasibility of lucrative commercial enterprises.4 Eastern peoples had sailed to the coasts of Iberia since at least the Neolithic, presumably in search of new landscapes, good weather and soils, and plentiful game, rather than on economic missions in a world of supply and demand. Greek and Phoenician coloniza- tion throughout the Mediterranean contributed to the development of a close network of relations between East and West in which economic aspects played a central role. The invention and use of coinage in the middle of the seventh century B.C. encouraged the accumula- tion of metals, especially silver and bronze, an import- ant aspect of interrelations in the Mediterranean from this period onwards. A surplus of silver may well have been accumulated prior to the use of coinage. Franke- stein has suggested that the Phoenicians needed silver 4 J.

By the eighth century B.C., the value of all goods in Assyria was probably measured in terms of a silver standard.5 Investigation of Tartessos requires consideration of these economic aspects, the appearance of coinage in the Mediterranean, and metallurgical activity in gen- eral. The importance of metals in references to Tar- tessos is consistent with results obtained in recent metallurgical studies and archaeological excavations in the Iberian Peninsula (fig. 1). The province of Huelva is part of the Iberian Pyritic Belt, a unique geological formation covering southwestern Spain and southern Portugal-an area 35 x 250 km. Iron, cop- per, silver and gold are produced in great quantities within this belt.6 The active role played by Phoeni- cians in the Mediterranean metal trade is well corrob- orated archaeologically in southern Spain: ancient sil- ver slag is found in abundance in the Tartessian towns of Huelva so far investigated.' In 1970, Allan suggested that the slag dumps at Riotinto (Huelva) "represent the largest accumulation in one site of an- cient pyrometallurgical residues,"8 some 15,000,000 tons. He posited that this accumulation occurred largely during pre-Roman times-probably prior to the mid-first millennium B.C.-as a result of the smelting of silver by Cypriot and Phoenician technicians.9 In 1981, Rothenberg and Blanco published their extensive survey on the evolution of extractive metal- lurgy in the mining districts of Huelva province, from Chalcolithic times down to the Roman intervention. During the Late Bronze Age, the extraction of silver in Huelva reached industrial proportions. Archaeo- logical excavation in the Riotinto area was carried out by Blanco, Luz6n and Ruiz-Mata in 1968 at the site of Cerro Salom6n, occupied during the eighth and sev- enth centuries B.C. A group of Phoenician structures was uncovered; the associated artifacts-granite pes- tles, stone mortars and grinding implements-are ty- pical of ancient smelting sites and indicate that the structures had served as metallurgical workshops.10 Chemical analyses of slag samples indicate the pro- duction of silver.11 Another recent excavation in the Riotinto area has been undertaken by Pellicer at the site of Quebranta- huesos, a Tartessian metallurgical settlement dated to the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.12 The four seasons of digging at Almonte (Huelva) undertaken by Ruiz-Mata and Fernafndez-Jurado have clarified the process involved in reducing the ar- gento-jarosite ores for the exploitation of silver. The first step consists of heating the crushed mineral to- gether with a flux such as lime or silica in a furnace or kiln. From this procedure, two products are obtained: the slag and a compound of lead, silver, and gold. The second step involves cupellation:13 the metal com- pound is placed in a crucible made of lime, bone, and water. This crucible attracts lead, leaving silver free in profitable quantities. Unfortunately, no crucibles were found at Almonte,14 but 3,000 kg. of slag were analyzed by Riotinto Minera, and lime samples taken from the area of a possible furnace yielded an average of 18 gr./TM of silver (Ag) and 0.15 gr./TM of gold (Au). Another system of exploiting silver also docu- mented at Almonte involves placing the metal com- pound (lead, silver, and gold) in an open container: the application of heat produces the volatization of lead as litharge in the form of PbO, and thus liberates the silver. The analysis of 16 pieces of pottery with slag adhering to the walls showed an average of 358 Ag (gr./TM) and 0.9 Au (gr./TM). The only fur- nace so far excavated is a simple hole in the ground 5 S.

The survey by Rothenberg and Blanco was based mainly on surface materials from 39 mining and smelting sites and three non-metallurgical sites. Full- scale excavation was undertaken only at the metallur- gical settlement of Tejada (Huelva), a site with an area of ca. 10.42 ha., surrounded by broad mounds and bastions clearly visible in the contours of the ground.'" The excavation was limited in horizontal extension, but evidence from Trench A2-A3 docu- ments "the lowest layer (3) which belongs to a phase prior to the construction of the agger. The pottery was dated to the Middle and Late Bronze Age (ca. 11th century B.C.). Layer 2 represents the period of the settlement enclosed by the agger (ninth-eighth cen- turies B.C.) in which native handmade pottery con- tinued to be predominant, indicating that the major occupation of the agger was prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians, or before the domineering effects of their commerce were felt."'6 As iron tools are not employed, it appears that the Phoenicians did not introduce to the region any technological improvements in mining operations. Perhaps their only innovation was the sys- tem of shafts and galleries seen at Riotinto. The ar- chaeological and metallurgical evidence points to Ibe- rian exploitation of the mines prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians and Greeks in the eighth to sixth cen- turies B.C. The mines remained in Tartessian hands;'7 Phoenicians and Greeks simply provided new markets, encouraging large-scale exploitation of the resources, which led in time to an Orientalizing phase of Tartessian culture. Another metal found in the area was tin."8 Since this metal is found in alluvial deposits, no metallur- gical activities were needed. Cassiterite or tin-stone is usually associated with alluvial gold; Strabo and Pliny both refer to the exploitation of stream tin in Iberia, noting that methods of panning gold were used for tin as well. The richest alluvial deposits in Iberia are found in the northwest, in Galicia and Extremadura. Abundant Tartessian materials have been found at Extremadura, along with a kylix painted by Euchei- ros, dated to ca. 560 B.C. (fig. 2), and the famous Ori- entalizing treasure of Aliseda of 650 B.C. (fig. 3). With such precious resources of gold and tin, Extre- madura was part of the Tartessian area of influence. The analysis by atomic absorption spectrometry of 20 bronzes found at Tejada shows them to be tin- bronzes averaging 6.5% tin; this compares well with 15 Rothenberg and Blanco 245; J.

In March 1983, the excava- tion of an empty lot on Puerto Street, in the center of the city, provided an impressive amount of Greek ware-1400 sherds from a trench only 6 x 4 m.20 A wide variety of Eastern Mediterranean provenances and painters is represented:21 a black-figured cup (fig. 4) attributed to the Tlesson Painter (560-540 B.C.); a vessel (fig. 5) attributed to the Little Master group (560-540 B.C.); two cup-sherds from Laconia, one of which is attributed to the Naucratis Painter (570 B.C.); a Gordion cup with characteristics that point to Kleitias (560 B.C.); a Siana cup with floral decoration (570 B.C.); a tripod-pyxis (560 B.C.); cups and a sky- phos of the Komast Group (585-570 B.C.); two Io- nian cups of the early sixth century B.C. (type B.1 in Villard/Vallet's classification), one of them complete; a column-krater of uncertain workshop but with simi- larities to the Phocaean ware of southeastern France (600-575 B.C.); two inscriptions in Greek; Late Geo- metric bird-skyphoi (750-700 B.C.), unfortunately out of context; several amphora sherds from Athens (575-550 B.C.), Chios (early sixth century B.C.), Co- rinth (a type A transport amphora from the early sixth century B.C.), and Samos (first half of the sixth century B.C.).22 Recently, Cabrera and Olmos have Fig. 4.

(Courtesy Servicio de Arqueologia, Diputaci6n Huelva) published additional Greek pottery from Puerto Street (Huelva), including a cup from Samos found in Huelva within a late seventh-century context but dated elsewhere to the first half of the sixth century B.C.23 If a city of Tartessos indeed existed, it may well have been located beneath modern Huelva. These ex- ports are truly worthy of Herodotos's King Argan- thonios of Tartessos, who would have had access to the highly productive silver mines in Huelva as well as tin and gold from Extremadura.24 The luxury items brought by Phoenician and Greek entrepreneurs to the Far West were probably traded for the metals needed in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean for the beginning of coinage.25 As we have seen, the extraction of silver in the Huelva region is documented archaeologically from the eighth century B.C. onwards. The bullion ob- tained then, and throughout most of the seventh cen- tury B.C., was probably shipped in the form of Hack- silber, negotiable by weight in the Eastern and Cen- tral Mediterranean markets.26 The accumulation of metals was made possible by the plentiful supplies in the Iberian Peninsula. The idea of coinage must have come about once regular sources for the precious met- als were known. Navigators, prospectors, merchants, and colonists were able to obtain the bulk silver at Phoenician, Egyptian (Naucratis), Sicilian, and South Italian trading centers, or directly from the Tartessian area of influence.

Prior to the exploitation of the Laurion mines,29 the main sources for Aegean silver were the northern Greek mining districts in Macedonia and Thrace, the Strymon region, and the mines on Siphnos.30 The search for silver in the early Mediterranean metals trade (800-500 B.C.) took place within a general con- text of maritime movements. It is known that areas without silver mines such as Naucratis and Sicily were amply supplied with the metal by trade. Aegine- tans frequented Naucratis in the sixth century, the period during which Aegina served as a mint. Corinth was also able to use Tartessian silver brought by Samians who did not mine their own silver and did not have any regular source of supply abroad, according to results obtained through neutron activation.31 Evidence presented by Kraay on the movements of coins from their areas of origin suggests that only sil- ver-producing areas such as Athens, Thrace and Macedonia "exported" their coins with the surplus available. Such a surplus is not represented by sixth- century coins from Sicily or South Italy32 since their silver came from both ends of the Mediterranean: Huelva and the Aegean sources mentioned above. The earliest coins in Sicily date from 570-560 B.C. and were struck at Selinus and Himera.33 Soon after- wards, Zancle and Naxos started coining, employing the standard used at Himera and perhaps also the same source of silver (which is unlikely to have been in Italy since no ancient silver mines are known there).34 Recognizing Tartessos as a primary source of metal for Archaic silver coins is difficult since there are no coins struck in the Tartessian territory and the metal exported to the Central and Eastern Mediterranean was probably fused with bullion from a number of sources in "cities which had no immediate and exclu- sive access to a primary source of metal."35 Neverthe- less, the Huelva mines have never been seriously con- sidered in the provenance studies so far conducted and it is likely that lead isotope analysis of Tartessian sil- ver would support its extensive use in coinage during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CONTEXT OF TARTESSOS The archaeological excavations of the last decades have clarified the successive phases of Tartessian cul- ture (Table 1) and the regions in which we can expect to find more data in future investigations. Western Andalusia (Huelva, Seville, Caidiz, and C6rdoba), Extremadura (Badajoz and Ciceres) and southern Portugal (Baixo Alemtejo and Algarve) were charac- terized by a highly similar material culture during the Late Bronze Age (LBA); about 90% of all Tartessian objects from the Iberian Peninsula have been found in these areas. The extent and nature of archaeological investigations have varied among the three zones. Por- tugal has not been surveyed and excavated as exten- 27 J.H. Kroll and N.M.

Additional data from the Alemtejo and Algarve are required to clarify aspects of Tartessos still undeciphered. The Phoenician settlements and necropoli are lo- cated on the coasts of Cadiz, Malaga, Granada, and Almeria (fig. 1).36 These trading posts secured access to Tartessos, facilitating the transportation of bulky commodities such as metals, furniture, chariots, cloth, and oils. Phoenician materials from Tartessian sites of the Lower Guadalquivir (Carambolo) and Huelva (Cabezo San Pedro) are found together with imita- tions and a high percentage of handmade ware. The pattern followed by the Phoenicians was to locate fac- tories at the mouth of a river on the first hill, 12-20 m. from the delta.37 Guadalhorce, Toscanos, Morro Mezquitilla, Almufihcar, and Adra were structured in this fashion as was Cerro del Prado (Guadarranque, Cidiz), a site now lost under modern construction.38 Molina Fajardo and his team have located the Phoe- nician settlement of Sexi (Almufiecar, Granada) at Plaza de la Constituci6n. They date the Phoenician materials found to the eighth century B.C.39 The geographical reconstruction of Tartessos would be incomplete without the geological studies which document significant changes from the modern landscape. The main change lies in the navigability of today's decreased marshlands which correspond to the lacus Ligustinus mentioned in the Ora Maritima (291). Gavala and, more recently, Menanteau have traced the ancient shoreline in the estuaries of the Guadalquivir and Guadalete rivers.40 Ceramics excavated at LBA sites in eastern Anda- lusia-Monachil, Pinos Puente, Galera, Saladares, and others-show clear affinities with the ceramics from the Tartessian nuclear zone of western Andalu- sia: pattern-burnished ware, gray ware, and similar types of vase supports appear in stratigraphic se- 36 M.E.

Eastern colonists were more interested, during the eighth to sixth centuries, in the mineral wealth found in the southwest. The rich galena deposits found in the southeast were not exploited until Punic times, and it is known that "the silver mines of New Car- thage (Cartagena, Murcia) were for a long time the main source of silver for the Roman State."451 A review of the LBA chronology proposed by Mo- lina Gonzilez46 and Arteaga47 for eastern Andalusia is useful in defining the context of study although there are discrepancies with the chronology used by investigators in western Andalusia.48 The first sys- tematic investigations of the LBA and Iron Age in the southeast were carried out by the pioneers of Spanish archaeology, the Belgian Siret brothers. They identi- fied a series of cinerary graves on the coast of Almeria and Murcia,49 which represented the first phase of the Iron Age introduced by European Urnenfelder. In 1962, Schiile and Pellicer investigated the Bronze Age settlements of Cerro la Virgen and Cerro del Real. The lowermost stratum excavated at Cerro del Real represented a phase clearly "pre-iberica" and pre- Phoenician but post-Argarian.50 Recent excavations by researchers at the University of Granada in their province have supplemented our knowledge of LBA ceramics and metallic objects (palstaves, "hachas de tal6n," elbowed fibulas and Carp's Tongue swords); both classes of material reflect Mediterranean and At- lantic influences.51 The presence of cremation burials in the southeast and Tagus estuary two centuries be- fore the Orientalizing impact has not yet been satis- factorily explained although the cultural similarity of the two areas during LBA I (1100-850 B.C.) is well established. Necropoli of this early phase are rare in the southeast, however, and non-existent in the Tar- tessian zone. During LBA II (850-750 B.C.), rela- tions with western Andalusia are clear, and in the next phase, LBA III (750-600 B.C.), the appearance of Phoenician and Greek ceramics at sites excavated by the German Archaeological Institute provides a solid chronological framework.52 The "horizonte pre- ibe'rico" (675-600 B.C.) is defined by a greater fre- quency of intrusive elements such as polychrome and red-slip wares in conjunction with a great quantity of amphoras, all with parallels well documented at Tos- canos and Tartessian sites in western Andalusia such as Cabezo San Pedro, Macareno, and Castillo Dofia Blanca. The key site for establishing Phases II and III in the southeast is Cerro los Infantes (Pinos Puente, Granada) with stratified LBA and pre-Iberian depo- sits which clarify the rise of Classical Iberian culture during the fifth century B.C.53 41 A.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 Phoenician wares were found at Pefi6n de la Reina (Almeria), comprising 5% of the ceramic assemblage of Phase IIIa; a Canaanite jar was also dated to this phase. Phase IIIb includes typical Tartessian materi- als such as pattern-burnished ware while wheelmade ceramics (ca. 700 B.C.) represent only 1.31%. Pat- tern-burnished ware disappears in Phase IIIc and wheelmade ceramics, mainly amphoras, comprise 13.53% of the assemblage. The only Tartessian ele- ment found in this subphase is a bronze belt-buckle.54 Another important site for documenting Phoenician Orientalizing influences on Tartessian culture is Pefia Negra (Crevillente, Alicante). GonzMlez-Prats and his team from the University of Alicante have worked at Pefia Negra for seven seasons. Several cultural hori- zons have been established, dating from the Chalco- lithic to Late Iberian (2500-100 B.C.). The LBA and Early Iron Age (EIA) sequence at Pefia Negra is di- vided into Phase I (800-675 B.C.)55 and Phase II (675- 535 B.C.). In the first, we find burnished carinated bowls, vase supports, and incised geometric decoration with clear parallels in western Andalusia.56 The ne- cropolis from this phase includes 27 cremations, re- lated to those excavated by Siret and to others from Portugal and Setefilla, suggesting that the Tartessian world extended from Algarve to the Vinalop6 River in Alicante.57 Phase II is Orientalizing: the potter's wheel is introduced with the Phoenician repertoire of amphoras, ampullae, red-slip and polychrome ware; iron knives and bronze objects commonly found in the Tartessian zone include double-spring fibulas, belt- buckles, braziers, and elements from pyriform jugs. Gray ware with the same forms found in western An- dalusia and Extremadura are also present. The Medi- terranean colonization of Pefia Negra II is also seen in a "tesorillo" which included, among other interesting objects, a gold repousse diadem with Etruscan affini- ties, and six faience scarabs bearing Egyptian hiero- glyphs; four of the scarabs repeat the name AMON, three of which have cryptographic inscriptions of the god.58 Gamer-Wallert concludes that they are Egyp- tian objects, similar to those commonly found at Car- thage in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. and at Naucratis."9 TARTESSIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS The identification of elements specific to the ma- terial culture of Tartessos has resulted from archaeo- logical investigation in the area of western Andalusia.

A magnificent 7-lb. gold treasure (figs. 6-7) was unearthed by chance, and led to immediate excavation in the area known as "fondo de cabafia," where the treasure had been found, and shortly afterwards in the "poblado bajo," 150 m. to the north, where a series of rectangu- lar houses was exposed.60 The materials published and stored in the Museum of Seville include ceramics comparable to those found subsequently in other stra- tified deposits in the area. Recent excavations at sites such as Macareno, Sete- filla, Carmona, Colina los Quemados, Almonte, Ca- bezo San Pedro, Cabezo la Esperanza, and Medellin have produced comparable artifactual assemblages, dated to the LBA-EIA, from the ninth to the first half of the sixth century B.C.61 Further chronological divi- sion has been attempted by several archaeologists-- Almagro Gorbea, Pellicer, Molina Gonzalez, Arte- aga, Aubet, Ruiz-Mata, and Fernaindez-Miranda-- who dated the Tartessian materials from their excava- tions by reference to associated Phoenician ceramics known elsewhere on the Peninsula, at sites such as Toscanos, Morro Mezquitilla, Chorreras, Almufi&amp;- car, and Guadalhorce. In turn, the Phoenician ceram- ics were dated on the basis of Greek ceramics and parallels with other Phoenician materials well known around the Mediterranean. Phase I is most problematic to define because the Late Bronze Age begins at all sites except Setefilla after a Middle Bronze Age hiatus.62 Phase I corres- ponds to a time prior to Semitic influences, and is characterized by ceramics with painted or burnished geometric decoration of high quality. Some authors have pointed to the Atlantic Bronze Age as a probable source of inspiration for this early phase, as seen in the Huelva hoard (880-850 B.C.). The Carp's Tongue swords suggest this Atlantic connection but in the same hoard we find elbowed fibulas (fig. 8) which may be interpreted as evidence of early contacts with the Eastern Mediterranean. Iberian stelae with carvings of Herzsprung shields of the "V" type may also be from an eastern source (fig. 9). Such stelae are found 60 J.M. Carriazo, Tartessos y El Carambolo (Madrid 1973) 272. 61 These are the most important sites published, and there are more than 100 sites known from small-scale excavations and surface finds. 62 A grave with Argarian weapons at Setefilla dates to the Middle Bronze Age, with C14 dates in the 16th century B.C. Other Middle Bronze contexts include cist graves in the re- gion of Huelva and Chichina (Seville), but the graves have no significant offerings nor any connection to settlements.</page><page sequence="12">208 JAVIER G.

(Museo Ar- queol6gico Nacional, Madrid) in Cyprus, Crete, mainland Greece, and Samos,63 and are dated to the ninth century B.C.64 Frankestein states that the initial phase of Phoeni- cian trade in the Far West involved the distribution of Atlantic bronzework in the Balearics and southern Sardinia. From the western Iberian seaboard "they took bronze, raw materials, probably gold and amber, and used them to link up the islands of Sardinia and Sicily with North Africa and Northern Italy where such materials were much in demand."65 The Atlantic influence in western Andalusia is dif- ficult to trace, especially because such characteristic elements as the single- or double-looped palstaves are absent from excavated Tartessian contexts.66 Ceramic wares with geometric decoration, either painted or burnished, are the most representative Tartessian ele- ments from early deposits67 and will be individually discussed below. Ceramics Tipo Carambolo. Tipo Carambolo is a painted ware represented by large vessels (up to 1.20 m. in height and 50 cm. in rim diameter), carinated bowls, biconi- cal shapes with short vertical necks, and support stands (fig. 10). All were probably manufactured on a slow wheel. The pots received a reddish-brown slip which was then burnished. After firing, monochrome red straight lines were painted with a brush; in many Fig. 9.

The decora- tion is arranged in rectangular zones or in bands formed by metopes (fig. 10). Tipo Carambolo is found fully developed in western Andalusian contexts of Phase I (ca. 900-750 B.C.). Here lies a problem: how to explain such apparently advanced development, since Andalusia, as far as we know, does not offer evi- dence of any immediately previous ceramic stage, al- though most western Andalusian LBA settlements lie over Chalcolithic materials (Bell-Beaker decoration) found next to bedrock. The Greek Geometric period coincides with the chronological framework for the LBA in Andalusia. Although vessel forms are quite different, the arrange- ment of motifs on Greek and Andalusian vessels is similar, especially during the Middle Geometric Phase (850-760/750 B.C.).68 The Attic MG II krater (ca. 800-760 B.C.)69 discovered in Huelva City, un- fortunately out of context, reflects either an early Greek voyage to the Far West or a Phoenician cargo item. Early Tartessian commercial contacts with the Greek world probably occurred at the same time as Phoenician navigations.70 Tipo San Pedro. During Phases II (seventh century B.C.) and III (sixth century B.C.), the characteristic painted ware is Tipo San Pedro (fig. 11). This ware is absent from stratified deposits of Phase I at the site of San Pedro (Huelva City).71 The only form used is a thin-walled cup, possibly manufactured in a mold. Vessels are covered by a reddish-brown slip burnished to a high luster, almost metallic in appearance. Red paint is applied after firing in very thin and carefully drawn lines. The repertoire of motifs is less varied than in Tipo Carambolo, and the symmetry of compo- sition is radial (fig. 11).72 Pattern-burnished Ware.

The earliest examples are found at sites around Huelva and Lower Guadalqui- vir in contexts of Phase I; during Phases II-III the Retl cula bruffida is found in the hinterland of Extre- madura, Upper Guadalquivir, and eastern Andalusia. In Portugal this ware has also been identified at sites such as Cerradinha,76 Outeiro do Circo,77 Marchil,78 Ratinhos,7" and Sdo Brfis,80 with dates of 725-600 B.C. The ware was produced in a variety of shapes from the ninth to the sixth century B.C. in the Penin- sula (fig. 12). The name Reticula brufaida refers to the reticulate pattern-burnished decoration, the most common motif (fig. 13).81 The origin of this fully evolved handmade ware is still a matter of speculation. Schubart suggests that it derived from the "stroke-burnished decoration" found on the Phoenician coast between 1000 and 850 B.C.82 Maluquer associates the ware with pattern-burnished bowls found in Byblos and thought by the excavators to have been imported directly from Gadir.83 In his study of Tartessos, Maluquer states that a similar Fig. 12.

Thus, in this instance, the transmission of Greek influence through their colonies is not in evi- dence. On the other hand, archaeologists working in the Eastern Mediterranean are often unfamiliar with Tartessian gray ware (fig. 14) and thus cannot satis- factorily compare different varieties. Gray ware was manufactured in the Iberian Peninsula, and was pre- sumably in wide demand since we find it at all Span- ish sites with Orientalizing levels.86 Improved tech- niques of manufacture introduced by the easterners, such as the fast wheel and a more successful combina- tion of clay and tempering agents, presumably con- tributed to the demand for the gray ware. Phoenician Ware. The key to the establishment of a chronological framework for Tartessian materials is their association with Phoenician ware. The metho- dical excavations carried out by the German Archaeo- logical Institute in the Phoenician factories of Tosca- nos, Morro Mezquitilla, Chorreras,87 and necropoli such as Trayamar and Jardin, all located on the coast of Mailaga, have provided Spanish archaeology with a series of shapes, in a red-slip ware, known in the Le- vant and Cyprus from ca. 850 B.C. onwards. The ar- rival of this ware in southern Spain, however, is dated by reference to Greek ceramics found at Toscanos (Protocorinthian kotyle fragments, Attic "SOS" am- phoras,88 and an Ionian bird-bowl cup)89 and at Al- mufi&amp;car (two complete Protocorinthian kotylai). These settlements present a clear Phoenician context with very few intrusions of handmade ware,90 and the finds from the necropoli include mushroom-topped flasks and trefoil-lipped jugs typical of Phoenician rit- ual in Western colonies such as Carthage or Motya.91 From the late eighth century B.C. onwards, Phoe- nician wares begin to appear at LBA sites such as Ca- bezo San Pedro, Carambolo, and Cerro los Infantes. 85 A.M.

Nine strata with 26 archaeological levels were identified, including one LBA level (750-700 B.C.), six Orien- talizing levels (700-575 B.C.), and an uninterrupted sequence until Roman times, ca. 100 B.C.93 This ex- cavation demonstrated that the materials imported from the East, found in Orientalizing levels,94 were not all strictly Phoenician in character but were also from the Phoenician koine, including materials classi- fied as Syro-Palestinian, Egyptian, Cypriot, Rhodian, Samian, Corinthian, and Athenian. In 1985, Pellicer and Amores published the results of their excavation at Carmona (Seville). The site is located in the important Tartessian area of "Los Al- cores" and had been excavated by Raddatz and Carri- azo in 1959.95 The recent investigations in 1980 un- covered pre-Colonial, Orientalizing, and Iberian lev- els. The sequence resembles that of Macareno, and the findings from both sites have been extensively compared in order to construct chronological and ty- pological frameworks for characteristic Tartessian ce- ramic forms and decorative patterns, as well as for the wide array of Phoenician ceramics.96 The red-slip sherds found in southern Spain repre- sent the largest sample of Phoenician ware outside Phoenicia and, for this reason, Phoenician studies in Spain are increasingly important for understanding the Phoenician expansion to the West. Morro Mez- quitilla produced 9,000 Phoenician sherds in a single excavation season. A French team directed by Gran Aymerich has excavated in Malaga City (Castle of Al- cazaba) an Orientalizing level 3 m. in thickness with abundant Phoenician ware and Greek imports (late seventh century B.C.), an Ionian B.2 cup (600-575 B.C.), and Ionian and Attic amphoras; carinated bowls and handmade ware are found in an earlier level.97 The tell of Castillo Dofia Blanca, only 18 km. of navigable distance from the legendary Gadir, has pro- vided abundant red-slip pottery, the plate and cari- nated bowl being the most common shapes; the reper- toire of Phoenician ware is completed with ampullae, bowls, urns (polychrome decoration), lucernae, tri- pods and amphoras. The earliest Phoenician materi- als at the site date from the first half of the eighth cen- tury B.C., comparable to Oriental wares stratified at Hazor VII-V, Tyre IV, and Toscanos I and II. Dofia Blanca also shows cultural affinity with Phoenician materials from Mogador on the Moroccan Atlantic seaboard. During the seventh century wheelmade ce- ramics are predominant (90%) and ca. 550 B.C. there are some Greek imports: "SOS" and Corinthian amphoras, Ionian and Attic cups.98 Plain wheelmade ware comprises the bulk of Phoe- nician ceramics found at the Spanish factories. Am- phoras related in form to "Canaanite jars" must have contained olive oil and wine.99 During the seventh century B.C., such amphoras are found in all Tartes- sian sites, thus providing evidence of trade with the colonists.100 The most common shape in red-slip ware is the plate. The width of lip was used by archaeologists at Toscanos as a chronological index: narrow lips (2-6 cm.) were found at all levels, but wide lips (7 cm.) do 92 M. Bel6n, M. del Amo and M.

Ritual vases such as mushroom-topped flasks, trefoil- lipped jugs, and incense-burners were apparently re- stricted to the first few generations of colonists and on- ly appear at the factories.'13 The evolution of late red-slip ware (450-150 B.C.) can be observed at Macareno and Carmona; the slip becomes a purplish-red, typical of Iberian Classical wares, and quite different from the Orientalizing cor- al red-slip characteristic of the Phoenician workshops and Tartessian levels.104 Polychrome ware with parallel red and black bands is common in settlements but is completely absent from the early shaft graves of Almufi&amp;car and ashlar- built chambers of Trayamar. Here the cremation burials were placed in alabaster urns105 or red-slip amphoras. In funerary contexts of ca. 650-500 B.C., globular urns of polychrome ware (Tipo Cruz del Ne- gro) were used to hold the ashes of the deceased, as seen at Frigiliana, La Joya, and Setefilla (fig. 15).o06 In settlements, Cruz del Negro urns are found from the end of the eighth century B.C. onwards.107 Polychrome ware represents the earliest painted wheelmade ceramics in the Iberian Peninsula. The forms identified so far range from typical Phoenician shapes to others made by Tartessians (e.g., vase sup- ports and thistle-head vases).108 Recently, in Tartes- sian contexts of the seventh century B.C., several poly- chrome sherds depicting typical Orientalizing features such as lotus buds, griffins, and bulls have appeared (fig. 16).109 None, however, has been found at the Phoenician trading-posts. In summary, the evolution of Tartessian ceramics shows three phases: I) LBA: handmade ware with geometric decoration (Tipo Carambolo and Retfzcula brufiida); II) Early Orientalizing: alongside indige- nous handmade ceramics we see the first imports of Eastern materials starting ca. 750 B.C.; III) Late Ori- entalizing: wheelmade ceramics predominate in the strata of this phase (650-550 B.C.).

Bronzework In this section, Tartessian bronze objects in the form of jugs, braziers, incense-burners, fibulas and belt-buckles are analyzed. We shall concentrate main- ly on examples found during excavation. The Mediterranean wave of influence, during the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., reached the shores of Iberia presumably via the Phoenician colonies, but the material evidence is found primarily in the Orientaliz- ing contexts of Huelva City and along the Tinto and Odiel rivers (more than 50% of the finds), the lower Guadalquivir and the area to the north, along the Guadiana and Tagus rivers, just south of the Douro. This latter zone of expansion in Extremadura and Meseta was extremely rich in cassiterite (tinstone) and gold, both of which were found in hand-picked alluvial deposits. The economic importance of these metals and of silver was appreciated in the East by merchants who knew where and how to profit--in ex- change for luxury or prestige items-from the mer- chandise acquired in Tartessos.1" The indigenous population understood little about the geographical extension of the Mediterranean Sea, but knew per- fectly well where to find the precious stones that East- ern merchants desired. Jugs. Garcia Bellido was the first to publish the eight examples of Tartessian bronze pyriform jugs known before 1960, dividing them into three groups on the basis of the palmette at the base of the handle, and the type of rim: 1) trefoil lip and Phoenician pal- mette; 2) horizontal rim, and a Phoenician palmette with two lotus stems at its base and three serpents' heads at the rim; and 3) zoomorphic spouts and Phoe- nician palmette (fig. 17).112 Only one of the examples studied by Bellido could be related to an archaeologi- cal context. That example, now housed at the His- panic Society of America in New York City, had been published in 1899 by Bonsor, and was reported to have been found in a cremation grave which also con- tained a brazier and iron fragments. The characteris- tics observed in the workmanship and decoration of 12 bronze jugs permitted Blanco, Maluquer, Cuadrado, and Bellido to date them prior to the fifth century B.C. and to identify them as Tartessian. Grau Zimmerman has recently published a com- prehensive study of the bronze jugs, emphasizing the Orientalizing contexts of the Phoenician metal jugs known thoughout the Mediterranean.1I3 Cyprus of- fers clearly related examples made in pottery and 110 Fernandez-Miranda (supra n. 92) 850-51, fig. 4.

The appearance of jugs and bra- ziers in Phoenician tombs is rare; only in Almufiicar was one bronze brazier handle found. Braziers. As with jugs, the production of bronze braziers occurs in Tartessian Orientalizing contexts of the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. The braziers are shallow objects forged in bronze or silver with dia- meters of 20-45 cm., slightly convex bases, vertical sides and horizontal rims. Most distinctive are their handles, cast pieces held to the vessel by means of riv- ets;122 solid-cast rosettes are found along the rim. Ex- tended hands are usually represented at either end of the handles (fig. 20), and two rings often support the Fig. 19. Brazier with lotus-flower motif from Tomb 17, La Joya. (J.

(25th-26th Dynas- ties). From Egypt, Phoenicians and Cypriots carried the vessels to the Far West.'25 The shape is certainly familiar in Cyprus and there are clear examples in the Cesnola Collection.'26 Similar objects used in the fu- nerary ritual were also found at Gordion,'27 dated 725-700 B.C., as well as in the Regolini-Galassi Tomb in Italy.128 But no other place in the Mediter- ranean contains more numerous examples of the hand-motif as handle than the Iberian Peninsula, in- creasing the likelihood that this type of brazier was a Tartessian cultural object which spread to the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 been interpreted as part of a Tartessian funerary prac- tice, recalling its Oriental and Mediterranean deriva- tion; generations of colonists in the Peninsula adapted the ritual over time to a Tartessian practice. Almagro Gorbea thinks the jug was probably used in the liba- tion ritual,130 whereas Blizquez relates the braziers to the cremation of the corpse and/or perfumes.131 Comparable practices have been postulated for somewhat later Classical Iberian (fifth-fourth centu- ries B.C.) funerary contexts, especially in the south- east. The libation ritual is corroborated by a legend under Zeus's head on the Kylix of Medellin (fig. 2). Jugs and kylikes are frequently found in fifth-century necropoli such as El Cigarralejo and Cabecico del Te- soro,132 both in the province of Murcia. Bronze bra- ziers are also found in Classical Iberian necropoli such as Baza.133 Characteristic Orientalizing ele- ments of the braziers like lotus flowers, Hathor heads or rosettes, however, were not displayed.134 Incense-burners. Thymateria, or incense-burners, were also introduced to the Iberian Peninsula by the Orientals. The Phoenician examples known from necropoli such as Trayamar are made of a red-slipped ware135 while the incense-burners in Tartessos are made of bronze and are similar to metal and ivory ex- amples from Cyprus (Salamis, Curium, and Tamas- sos; see also the Cesnola Collection).136 The most characteristic Tartessian type has one or more lotus flowers ornamenting the shaft which rests on either a trumpet base or a tripod with feline's paws. The shaft supports a conical bowl with a hori- zontal rim on which the perfumes were actually burned. The repetition of the floral motif in all known examples suggests a connection with the essence of the incense burned within. The religious and sacred cha- racter of these thymateria has been recognized by se- veral authors but the nature of the ritual has not been explained.137 The so-called lotus-flower motif (figs. 18-19) may represent opium poppies, the intoxicating effects of which may have been used by the Oriental tradesmen on the indigenous population to introduce the metaphysical and spiritual world reflected in the new funerary ritual. Apart from the effects derived from the alkaloids, the average globular capsule of Pa- paver Somniferum contains between 6,000 and 7,000 seeds, and the oil obtained from the seeds is similar to olive oil, useful in cooking and also in lamps,138 ano- ther innovation brought by Phoenicians to Tartessos. Fibulas. Two types of fibulas are represented in the Peninsula: elbowed fibulas, found in the Huelva hoard (fig. 8) and represented on the stelae with Herz- sprung shields (fig. 9), and double-spring fibulas.139 The former are dated to the LBA (mid-ninth century B.C.), a time prior to Oriental colonization (if we un- derstand by this the estalishment of Phoenician settle- ments and necropoli).140 Recently, another elbowed fibula was found at a burial site at San Romain de Hornija (Valladolid), contemporary with material of the Cogotas I phase in the Meseta, where a C14 date of 870 B.C. was obtained.141 Still another, found at RoCa do Casal do Meio near Setubal (Portugal) in the ex- cavation of a LBA domed sepulcher, is similar to Whereas in Etruria silver was used more often than bronze, in Tartessos we observe the reverse trend and there are no known examples of silver jugs. 130 M.

Triangu- lar with two simple spirals, it is dated in Portugal by its excavators to ca. 900 B.C.142 The most characteristic type of fibula found in the Tartessian area and in the Phoenician colonies is the double-spring fibula. Phoenician in origin, this type is seen throughout the Mediterranean and is associated with the first appearance of iron.143 Parallels are found in Hamath, Tarsus, and Olympia.144 In Iberi- an Phoenician contexts, the fibulas are first seen at Toscanos, Frigiliana, and Trayamar during the sev- enth century B.C. Examples are known from Tartes- sian sites such as Cruz del Negro, Carambolo, and Setefilla; at Setefilla alone, 12 double-spring fibulas have been found in the excavation of Tumulus A.145 The only site in the Iberian Peninsula with el- bowed and double-spring fibulas stratified in dif- ferent levels is Cerro los Infantes (Pinos Puente, Granada). 146 Belt-buckles. Although belt-buckles are common in Celtic and Classical Iberian contexts, the Tartessian type, characterized by two pieces (one with hooks and the other with slots), appears only at Huelva, Seville, and Lower Alemtejo. Sporadic finds have been made in Caistulo (Jaen), Medellin (Badajoz), and Sanchor- reja (Avila).147 There are 75 examples known from this area which, when found within an archaeological context, always correspond to an Orientalizing phase of the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.148 Once more, the necropolis of La Joya in Huelva has provided graves which clarify the moment of use for these belt-buckles. The rich offerings in Tomb 17 in- cluded one of the five bronze belt-buckles found in the necropolis; a specimen from Tomb 19 was covered by a thin sheet of silver.149 The recent excavations at the necropolis of Setefilla also provide good examples alongside double-spring fibulas, Phoenician and handmade wares, and ivories.10s The motifs repre- sented on the buckles are the Tree of Life, griffins, quadrupeds, and geometric patterns. Although simi- lar features are found in Etruscan examples from Praeneste,151 the Tartessian belt-buckles were un- doubtedly manufactured in a local workshop which also produced bronze jugs, braziers, etc.152 An important underwater discovery in Caidiz (Sancti Petri) in December 1984 should be mentioned in closing. The discovery of three magnificent bronze statuettes (40 cm. high), apparently representing an Oriental "Smiting God" of the type identified with the god Reshep,153 still keeps alive the hopes of finding the famous temple consecrated to Hercules Gadita- nus.154 The statuettes have been published as repre- sentations of an Oriental god with Egyptian attributes (eighth-seventh centuries B.C.) related to examples found in Samos."15 142 K.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 Goldwork Gold is surely the easiest metal with which to work, and it is probably the first metal used for ornamental purposes.156 In the Iberian Peninsula the use of gold begins in the Chalcolithic period (third millennium B.C.) and continues during the Bronze Age (second millennium) in cultures such as El Argar. It is also common during the Atlantic Bronze Age in Portugal, Extremadura, and the northwestern corner of the Pe- ninsula. A magnificent collection of pre-Roman Por- tuguese treasures is exhibited at the Museu Leite de Vasconcelos (Lisbon), and another, equally impres- sive, at the Archaeological Museum of Madrid. During the LBA, the production of heavy pieces of jewelry (many over 2 kg. in weight) occurs in three areas: the Northwest, Extremadura, and the South- east. Goldsmiths in these areas smelted gold in sheets and solid bars, as in torques (fig. 21) and bracelets. The decoration is always geometric, usually engraved in the western examples and repousse6 with radial and concentric motifs in the 11 golden bowls from Villena, Alicante (fig. 22). In this same treasure were found the characteristic bracelets with grooves, prongs and open-work, techniques also seen in LBA examples from Portugal and Extremadura. Almagro Gorbea is of the opinion that the Villena Treasure was hidden during the eighth century B.C.'57 The torques from Extremadura (Berzocana and Sagrajas) have a much more extensive time span, from the 12th to the eighth century B.C., and are similar to torques from Brittany and halskragen from northern Europe. Also from Ex- tremadura, the Treasure of Bodonal well exemplifies the Atlantic influences deriving from Ireland. A drastic change in the type of goldwork manufac- tured occurs during the Orientalizing period in the Peninsula. This is best perceived in the jewelry from Trayamar and Aliseda: the former, a Phoenician ne- cropolis in Malaga dated ca. 650 B.C., and the latter, roughly contemporary, located in the rich auriferous zone of Extremadura. An Iberian source for the gold used in the Trayamar jewels has been ascertained by Pingel,158 but the use of the metal is completely dif- ferent from the LBA examples. Here, granulation, fi- ligree, and repousse are employed, and zoomorphic designs decorate new forms of jewelry like medallions, earrings, revolving rings, and articulated headbands. Thin sheets of metal are worked, in contrast to the heavier torques and bracelets of earlier times. The light fracture now prevalent is evident in the 93 ele- ments of jewelry recovered from Ebora (Caidiz), 30 of which were excavated by Carriazo.'59 As stated above, the discovery of the magnificent treasure at El Carambolo near Seville (figs. 6-7) pro- moted Tartessian studies in western Andalusia. The treasure itself,160 found inside a ceramic vessel, con- sists of 21 pieces of pure gold weighing approximately 7 lbs.: a necklace with seven pendants (fig. 6), two large bracelets, two ox-hide pectorals (fig. 7) that re- Fig. 21.

Forbes (supra n. 29) 156. 157 The discovery of the Treasure in Villena led to further excavation in the area by J.M. Soler, who dates the Trea- sure much earlier, ca. 1000 B.C. Most of the material from Soler's excavations is still unpublished. Almagro Gorbea has taken into account recent archaeological discoveries and dates the Treasure to the eighth century B.C.: M. Almagro Gorbea, "Orfebreria del Bronce Final en la Peninsula Iberi- ca," TrabPrHist 31 (1974) 89; Molina Gonzalez (supra n. 46, 203) agrees with Soler in the early date. 158 V. Pingel in H.

The delicate use of repousse, granulation and filigree gives a splendorous look of wealth to the jewels. The excavation undertaken during seven seasons (1976-1982) by Gonzilez-Prats at the site of Pefia Negra161 is an example of the solid archaeological work now clarifying many aspects of Iberian proto- history. The western Andalusian products and styles mingle with Phoenician elements. Most interesting is an Orientalizing treasure with only two gold orna- ments: a solid round bracelet and part of a headband on a thin sheet of metal with repousse closed pal- mettes. There are also two chains from silver neck- laces with their pendants: a phylacteric with a falcon's head, and six scarabs made in faience which have cryptographic inscriptions of the god Amon.162 Paral- lels for these objects are found in Carthage, Etruria, and Naucratis. Goldwork from Pefia Negra and the nearby sites of Saladares and Villena combines Tar- tessian and Orientalizing elements in a similar way. ARCHITECTURE AND TOWNPLANNING The LBA is marked by an absence of townplanning, with circular and oval huts (fondos de cabafia) scat- tered irregularly over the surface of sites. Single huts were identified at Carambolo Alto (the site of the treas- ure), Los Quemados (C6rdoba), Ategua (C6rdoba), and Montemolin (Seville), but the limited size of the stratigraphic trenches precluded recording the hori- zontal distribution of the huts. The site of San Barto- lome (Almonte, Huelva), however, provided such an opportunity since it offers only one level of occupation covering an area of 40 ha. During the first three cam- paigns (1979-1981), 34 features were identified, in- cluding dwellings in the form of fondos de cabania, smelting nuclei, and ditches of uncertain function.163 1'6 A.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 In the southeast hinterland, four LBA oval huts have been excavated at the site of Pefi6n de la Reina (Almeria). The dwellings, one of which is 10 m. long, were constructed ca. 700 B.C. (Phase III). All have foundations with a double line of vertical stones above bedrock filled with smaller pebbles, mud, and mud- bricks, while reeds and branches were used for the walls and roof. Hut 4 has two post holes in a central position, 2.25 m. apart. The huts were scattered ir- regularly over the site.164 At the site of Pefia Negra (Alicante) there is a C14 date of 740 (+50) B.C. from an oval LBA hut.165 The pattern of dispersed huts without stone foun- dations or apparent planning changes during the sev- enth and sixth centuries B.C. to one of rectangular houses with undressed dry stone foundations 40-50 cm. high, and streets laid out in an Eastern fashion.166 Successive building layers are characteristic, with one city built on top of the previous one. Most sites were abandoned during the fifth century B.C. for reasons neither historically nor archaeologically evident. Tell sites were identified in stratigraphic trenches excavated during the 1960s and 1970s, e.g., Caram- bolo Bajo, where an area of 15 x 25 m. was exposed, revealing four superimposed cities. More tell sites have been located and excavated in part at Setefilla,167 Alhonoz,'68 and Dofia Blanca (fig. 23). The last has revealed townplanning with rectangular houses dat- ing from ca. 750 B.C.; the walls have a coat of plaster and the floors are made of red clay. From the seventh to the fourth century B.C., there are two or three ur- ban levels stratified at the site.169 The use of rampart systems is also in evidence dur- ing the seventh and sixth centuries at Niebla, Car- mona, Setefilla, and Tejada la Vieja.170 The last site in particular will provide valuable information about the defensive systems of Tartessian cities as well as the role played by metal trade, with the publication of in- vestigations started in 1982 by Fernfindez-Jurado. Phoenician influence in architectural features is evident in the wall of San Pedro (Huelva City, 700 B.C.), excavated in 1978. The wall stretches 10 m. in Fig. 23.

It is com- posed of ashlar block pillars 2.20 m. high, with rubble filling,171 and belongs to the type that Pritchard called "Phoenician ribbed wall.""17 Examples from Ras Shamra, Megiddo IV, Tyre IX, and Hazor VB173 could have served as models for the construction of the San Pedro wall.174 The German Archaeological Institute has con- cluded that the wall of ashlar blocks at Toscanos dates from Roman times, for Roman pottery was discovered inside the foundation trench."17 The use of cushioned blocks is reminiscent of Palestinian building tech- niques (e.g., Samaria and Megiddo) but the only levels clearly associated with the wall are Roman (opus signinum) even though the foundation trenches had materials contemporaneous with the Phoenician trading posts. Niemayer states that the Romans of the first century A.C. probably used some ashlar blocks from older Phoenician constructions to build the wall. This would also explain the ashlar blocks without cushioning used by the Romans to complete the wall.176 The only Orientalizing temple as yet identified was excavated at Castulo (Jaen) by Blizquez and Vali- ente.'77 The Orientalizing period at Cistulo is dated about 100 years later than at Huelva or Malaga; no Greek wares appear until 425-400 B.C. The temple itself has rectangular rooms; the main room has an altar, a terracotta bull's head, a hearth, many ampho- ra sherds, slag with a high content of silver and gold, and a large jar with two hammers and crucibles."17 Blizquez compares this assemblage to those of rural temples in Cyprus. Another important feature is a mosaic made of river pebbles of various colors, dating to the end of the sixth century B.C.179 and thus the earliest mosaic in Western Europe. The temple was rebuilt at least three times and is dated to 700-500 B.C. on the basis of the ceramics: indigenous and Ori- ental wares, clay imitations of bronze cauldrons, etc. The divinity venerated in this temple is unknown. FUNERARY RITUAL As stated above, no pre-Colonial Tartessian necro- poli are known. The earliest examples in the first mil- lennium B.C. are Phoenician, located at Almufi&amp;car (Granada) and Trayamar (Malaga), both dated to the first half of the seventh century B.C. Thus, the first graves of Phoenician settlers have yet to be discovered: the site of Morro Mezquitilla, for example, was founded ca. 750 B.C., but the five graves from its ne- cropolis (Trayamar), excavated by the German Ar- chaeological Institute, date to 100 years later.180 The architecture and burial practices employed in these two necropoli are wholly Oriental. Several features occur that are not found in other peninsular necropoli: the 4 m.-deep shaft graves of Almufi&amp;car and the ash- lar-built tombs of Trayamar, alabaster cinerary urns, and red-slipped ceramic forms such as mushroom- topped flasks, trefoil-lipped jugs, incense burners and jars. The somewhat different Carthaginean influence can be seen in necropoli such as Villaricos (Almeria), Jardin (Malaga), Caidiz, and Galeado (Portugal), all dated to the late sixth century B.C."8' Tartessian Necropoli Tartessian necropoli dating from 650-550 B.C. have been excavated in the province of Seville: Bon- sor's excavations in the area of Los Alcores,182 and, re- cently, Tumulus A and B at Setefilla; the province of Cidiz (Las Cumbres); the province of Huelva (La Joya); and the province of Badajoz (Aliseda and Me- dellin).

Judging by Bonsor's finds in the chamber of Tumulus H, the chamber in Tumulus A probably contained inhumations and rich grave offerings of amber, gold, silver, and ivory objects.18' Of great interest in the new investigations was the discovery of 45 cremation burials (33 under Tumulus B) beneath the chamber, and throughout the area under Tumulus A, inside small circular pits dug 10-15 cm. into the rock.'"' These cremations and the chamber pre-date the artificial mound of earth of the tumulus. Each cinerary urn was accompanied by personal objects of the deceased, such as double-spring fibulas, belt- buckles, rings, curved iron knives, and plates which contained meat and fish offerings. The ceramics found are both handmade and wheel-thrown. Local hand- made traditions of pattern-burnished and painted wares are inferior in quality to those of the pre-Orien- talizing LBA phase. The most common handmade urns in the necropolis are the thistle-head vases also known as "Chardon" urns, a shape of great popularity in the early stages of West Phoenician culture (Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, and North Africa)."87 The most char- acteristic wheel-thrown urn is the "Cruz del Negro." The urns contained the metal offerings and charred bones which seem to have been cleaned and separated from the ashes.188 No funerary pyres were located. Las Cumbres. The necropolis of Las Cumbres is as- sociated with the settlement of Castillo de Dofia Blan- ca. Only one of its numerous tumuli was excavated in 1985 and the results have not yet been published. The tumulus covered 58 cremations inside urns (mainly handmade thistle-head and wheel-thrown "Cruz del Negro" urns) which were hidden in pits carved in the rock. Numerous offerings were recovered from the urns dating to the second half of the eighth century and the beginning of the seventh century B.C., such as incense burners of red-slipped ware, double-spring fibulas, belt-buckles, iron curved knives, and two small alabaster perfume containers. The process of excavation revealed an ustrinum carved in bedrock (1.80 m. long, 60 cm. wide and 30 cm. deep) where the actual cremation of the corpse took place. The graves and the ustrinum were covered by a tumulus, 1.80 m. high in the center.'89 La Joya. The graves at La Joya were found not un- der a tumulus but in pits containing "Cruz del Negro" and "Chardon" urns, or "Canaanite" jars with charred bones and no ashes. Some pits may have served as actual places of cremation whereas others contained inhumations. Double burials with a crema- tion and an inhumation together were found.190 This necropolis is certainly more Orientalizing in character than Setefilla; many of the luxury objects found were of types introduced by Phoenicians throughout the Mediterranean or produced in Iberian workshops. The burial custom of placing urns inside pits does not have its origin in Carthage or North Africa, but rather in Sicily (Motya) or the Eastern Mediterra- nean. In southern Spain, this funerary practice is ex- emplified in the necropoli of Frigiliana (Milaga),191 Cruz del Negro (Seville), and La Joya (Huelva), all dated to the seventh and sixth centuries B.C.192 Outstanding finds from La Joya, in addition to the bronze jugs, braziers, incense-burners, and belt-buck- les mentioned above, include the following: horse- drawn chariots in Graves 12, 17, and 19; horse-bits made of an alloy of copper and zinc; two felines' heads, interpreted by Garrido as wheel hubs in the form of lionesses, similar to examples in sixth-century Lydian art; vase supports, a bronze mirror and tray with incised lotus and volute motifs; an ivory chest with four round anthropomorphic figurines dressed in Egyptian costumes, acting as carriers of the precious 183 Bonsor and Thouvenot (supra n. 150); Aubet and Ma- luquer (supra n. 145) 53. 184 M.E.

Although Greek ma- terial was not found at La Joya, the recent finds at Puerto Street, only 300 m. away, show that high- quality wares from the Greek world were also arriv- ing at this port during the period 625-550 B.C. Cer- tainly, the archaeological evidence points to Huelva as the most probable location for the legendary city or center of Tartessos. Medellin. Upstream on the Guadiana River, se- parating the provinces of Huelva and Badajoz from Portugal, in Extremadura, we find the important Tartessian settlement and necropolis of Medellin. Al- magro Gorbea excavated an area 9 x 6 m. in the ne- cropolis where he identified three types of funerary features, the first being the most common: 1) an urn with charred bones and no ashes, covered by a plate or stone, inside a pit at one time filled with ashes, char- coal and soil; 2) "busta" or "loculi," features which correspond to actual places of cremation, 1.50 m. long, full of charcoal, burnt logs and small bones not in- cluded in the urns; 3) "silicernia," deposits of offerings near but without direct connection to the graves, usu- ally full of plates-mainly gray ware and red-slip ware-and animal bones (especially goat). Luxury or prestige items include ivories, scarabs, and belt-buck- les.194 In 1982, a 4 x 4 m. trench was dug, confirming previous results and providing a great amount of new material from the sixth century B.C. The association of the "bustum," "Cruz del Negro" urns, and the type of offerings found at Medellin is also seen at the necropoli of Los Alcores and in some of the graves at La Joya and Setefilla. More striking is the similarity with Portuguese necropoli in the area of Ourique. Tumuli and offerings from Mealha-Nova and Herdade do Pego are directly comparable to those from Medellin,'95 although urns inside pits are absent from Ourique, while stone stelae with Tartessian in- scriptions are found. The most important Greek artifact as yet found at Medellin is an Attic kylix of ca. 560 B.C. painted by Fig. 24. Athena at the Judgment of Paris by Kleitias. Puerto Street, Huelva City. (P. Cabrera and R. Olmos) Eucheiros (fig. 2), recovered by chance in 1968 in the zone later identified as the necropolis. On one side of the cup a bearded Zeus holds a bundle of rays in each hand; on the opposite side, a man rides a galloping horse; inside, on the bottom, two roosters face each other. This kylix, together with a fragment of an olpe by Kleitias (fig. 24), discovered at Huelva by Garrido, and the finds from Puerto Street excavated by Fernfin- dez-Jurado are evidence that two generations of out- standing Greek potters exported their wares to Tar- tessos. The Huelva fragment is especially important in its representation of Athena at the judgment of Par- is, a new subject in Kleitias's repertoire (fig. 24).196 Blanco suggests that these high-quality products were intended for some kind of court, similar to those in Etruscan cities like Caere or Tarquinia, which re- ceived the products through Phocaean traders active 193 La Joya 167, 169, 170-71, 182, 184.

Velleius Paterculus's founding date for Caidiz of the 11th century B.C. has yet to receive archaeological verification.198 The bulk of early finds from necropoli in Caidiz can be dated to the Punic phase (ca. 500 B.C.). The most interesting recent discovery (1980) is a marble anthropoid sarcophagus representing a fe- male (fig. 25),'19 similar in workmanship to another sarcophagus representing a bearded figure found in 1887, both dated to the fifth century B.C. Ivories Ivories are commonly found in the context of Tar- tessian Orientalizing necropoli. Recent finds derive from excavations at La Joya, Osuna, Setefilla, and Medellin. The majority of the 200 decorated frag- ments known to date were found in the necropoli of Los Alcores. The most striking feature about Spanish ivories of the Early Iron Age is that, although introduced by Phoenicians, they are not found in the trading posts or factories of Malaga and Almufiecar.

In 1980, a systematic underwater survey around the Caidiz Bay area was begun and numerous ancient and modern wrecks have been located.

The most comprehensive and up-to-date studies of Tartessian ivories are by Aubet, who concludes that they were locally manufactured at one or two work- shops located in Carmona and/or Cidiz.201 The style of most examples is very similar, and suggests a limited number of workshops. The representation of griffins is almost identical on ivories from Bencarr6n, Acebuchal, Cruz del Negro, and Samos. The resem- blance is also manifest in engraved figures of goats (fig. 26), rams, bulls, sphinxes, horsemen, and solar emblems on ivories from Bencarr6n, Santa Lucia, Acebuchal, Cruz del Negro, Setefilla, Samos, and Ju- no Hill (Carthage).202 The local workshops produced primarily combs, plaques, chests, cosmetic palettes, and spoons. Such objects are found not only in Spain but also at Car- thage and Samos in contexts critical for defining the chronology of Tartessian ivories. The four engraved ivory combs from the Samian Heraion found in a con- text dated 640-630 B.C. are directly related to exam- ples from Cruz del Negro and Osuna; the Samian combs are thought to have derived from a workshop in the Lower Guadalquiver,203 perhaps as part of the cargo brought back to Samos in the historical voyage of Colaeus to Tartessos (Hdt. 4.152). In Carthage, the recent excavations at Byrsa Hill have produced sev- eral ivories with geometric decoration similar to examples known from Cruz del Negro. The Cartha- ginean cremation graves also contained Oriental ivo- ries and Protocorinthian ware dated ca. 650 B.C.204 A series of Phoenician metal bowls (absent in Spain) from Italy and Cyprus provides an additional chronological index. Those similar in decoration and Fig. 26. Engraved ivory from Cruz del Negro. (Photo P.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 the appearance of ivories almost exclusively in graves suggest that the Oriental iconography was valued by the indigenous population, as both attractive and apo- tropaic.207 THE EARLIEST WRITING SYSTEM IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA Stelae with epigraphic texts have been known from the area since the 18th century, when seven examples from Ourique (Portugal) and one from Alcali del Rio (Seville) were considered "sepulchral stones with Phoenician or Turdetan letters" by Bishop Cenaicu- 10.208 Hubner published his Monumenta Linguae Iberi- cae in 1893, including all texts collected during the 19th century. Influenced by readings of the script pro- posed by Humboldt and various numismatists, Hub- ner concurred that a single prehistoric language had existed for the entire Peninsula, that from which Basque derived.209 He identified the name K 0 'P ', repeated with various spellings on several stelae, as the pre-Indo-European "Conios" located by Avienus, Herodotus, and Herodorus of Heraclea Pontica in southern Portugal.210 Apart from this identification, no other toponyms were identified. G6mez-Moreno was the first to abandon this posi- tion on Basque-Iberianism, suggesting that two scripts could be distinguished in the Peninsula: Bastulo-Tur- detan of the Southwest and the Classical Iberian of the eastern coast.211 The former is of particular interest as it was brought to the Peninsula from the Eastern Mediterranean in a fully developed form during Tar- tessian times, i.e., the seventh-sixth centuries B.C. G6mez-Moreno thought this script was a development of an earlier syllabic writing (second millennium) brought from Anatolia during the phase of El Argar in the provinces of Almeria and Granada.212 To date, however, no inscriptions have been located in the ex- tensive excavations of Argarian cities and necropoli. The Tartessian script is known from 72 stelae, 12 of which are now lost, and only 20 of which show a complete text; 1500 signs are recognizable213 and have been coded by Correa into 49 groups. Four of these ( A, , 0, v) account for more than 50% of occur- rences. At least three vowels have been recognized. Only 17 signs are repeated more than 10 times, and these account for 90% of all recognizable signs. In all probability, not all signs were phonetic, and a few could have been numerals. Separation between words has been attested by Coelho,214 although other schol- ars such as Correa believe that no separations are dis- cernible. Fourteen signs are followed by vowels, although it is uncertain which; in 75% of the cases the writing is from right to left and generally the legend is concentric (fig. 27).215 A funerary formula is repeated, in its entirety or in part, in 50% of the texts:216 LAPO A T KOMVr (kOVD/M), KOrT1t). Such are the conclusions after many years of investi- gation, but decipherment is still far from complete. The Tartessian script finds its place with similar Carian, Lycian, Lydian, and Phrygian alphabets. The last, in particular, shows great affinity with both the Tartessian script and the stelae used. The sign 1, for instance, is attested in Phrygian in the eighth cen- tury, but is foreign to Greek, and it disappears in the sixth century (fig. 28).217 In Tartessian script, the sign is identified with the vowel u, and continues into Clas- sical Iberian. We are far from understanding the lan- guage spoken in Tartessos, but certainly the Semitic and Greek "ambience" in southwestern Iberia fa- vored, as in the Eastern Mediterranean, the transmis- sion of early alphabetic writing. 207 The themes represented on the Spanish ivories are al- ways Oriental. But characteristic Phoenician themes such as the "Woman at the Window," "Nude Woman," and "Cow Suckling a Calf" are absent: Blizquez 164. 208 C. Mello Beirio and M.

(Photo P. Witte, Deutsches Archaiologisches Institut, Madrid) Excavations conducted by Mello Beirio (1970- 1979) in the necropoli of Lower Alemtejo and Algarve provide information on the archaeological contexts of the stelae. The 72 examples known are heavily con- centrated in southern Portugal: Ourique has 20 stelae in its vicinity. They are also found in the Lower Gua- dalquiver (three examples), and Extremadura (Siru- ela, Badajoz and Madrofieras, Caiceres).218 In addi- tion to inscriptions on stone, ancient grafitti-also in Tartessian script-are found on pattern-burnished ware from Huelva (Cabezo San Pedro) and Medellin. At El Carambolo the grafitti are on red-slip ware and at Medellin on gray ware.219 The discovery of two stelae at Herdade do Mealha Nova (Ourique) led to the excavation of necropoli from the first phase of the Iron Age, consisting of one tumulus with cremations and several tumuli of in- humations with offerings of an Orientalizing charac- ter. A chronological index is provided by a scarab with a hieroglyph of Petubaste, Pharaoh of the 23rd Dy- Fig. 28. Stele with Tartessian epigraphic text, Pego II, Ourique. (Photo P.

Ceramics include carinated bowls, some of earlier Bronze Age forms made without the potter's wheel. The few pieces thrown on the wheel are Phoenician red-slip wares like those recovered from the necropolis of Chada.221 The beginning of the second phase of the Iron Age in southern Portugal is marked by Celtic migrations from the continent in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. The phase is characterized neither by script nor contact with the Eastern Mediterranean.222 Hesperia 38 (1969) 252-60, 279-80, fig. 7.43; Mello Beirio and Varela Gomes (supra n. 213) 497. 218 For the basic similarity in Spanish and Portuguese ste- lae, see Extremadura 275-77, ill. 85. 219 J. de Hoz, "La epigrafia prelatina meridional en His- pania," Actas I, 240, 271-80, 282-85.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 TARTESSIAN STELAE WITH FIGURATIVE ELEMENTS Different from inscribed stelae are Tartessian ste- lae of Almagro's Type II,223 found primarily in Ex- tremadura, the Guadalquiver River between the cities of Seville and C6rdoba, Lower Alemtejo, and Algarve. While writing is not found on these stelae, the representation of Tartessian objects and ritual are of interest. Varela Gomes and Pinho Monteiro have classified 27 examples into four subtypes (A-D), according to their figurative elements. The designs never occupy more than three-quarters of the total stone surface, thus leaving space at the bottom for insertion into the ground.224 The kinds of stone used are granite, calcite, and less frequently schist or sandstone.225 Type IIA stelae represent only three elements: spear, shield, and sword. These are the most common elements in all subtypes, and deserve closer anal- ysis.226 Spears are depicted with a head and a spear butt on the opposite end of the shaft, similar to those actually found in Portuguese necropoli such as Her- dade de Mealha Nova and in the Huelva Hoard. The former serves as a terminus post quem (seventh-sixth centuries B.C.) and the latter as terminus ante quem (C14 860-840 B.C.).227 The shield depicted is round with concentric circles broken by a "V"-the type known as Herzsprung shields. The handle, which must have been placed on the interior, is always repre- sented. Almagro Basch points to parallels in the East- ern Mediterranean at Idalion and Paleopaphos in Cy- prus. He also cites clay examples found at the He- raion of Samos as well as in northern Europe (espe- cially Ireland).228 No actual examples of the shields have been found as yet on the Peninsula. In contrast, Carp's Tongue swords, represented on the stelae of Type II, were actually found in the Huelva Hoard; there are also several examples from stray finds along the Guadalquivir, and in the rich hoards from Por- tugal. In addition, a bivalve mold used to produce Carp's Tongue swords was discovered recently at Ronda (Milaga).229 In Type IIB, depictions of mirrors, combs, fibulas, chariots or carts, and helmets are added to the pre- vious elements. The shield continues to occupy a cen- tral position. An excellent example of this subtype is the Torrej6n I stele from Ciceres that shows a cart drawn by two beasts, funerary motifs typical of the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age of Central Europe, the Mediterranean, and Near East. These carts represent the first graphic evidence for the use of the wheel in the Peninsula. The arrow, elbowed fibula, and spear are of the same types found in the Huelva Hoard. Type IIC introduces the human figure, and a smal- ler shield, without the typical "V" angles, is common. The spear usually is shown parallel to the human fig- ure, and the sword is close to the warrior's hand. An outstanding example with a horned helmet was found at Magacela (Badajoz). The type is represented at Fuentecantos, Torrej6n III, and San Martinho I. The distribution of this subtype reaches the Guadalquivir (two examples) and Algarve (one example). In Type IID we see the warrior surrounded by his weapons and personal objects. In addition, other as- pects of his life that are difficult to interpret are por- trayed. In an example from Ategua (fig. 29), a warrior is shown accompanied by his cart and weapons; in the same scene, a corpse lies on the funerary pyre, animals are sacrificed, and a sort of hand-in-hand dance is per- formed.230 Bendala compares the scene in this stele with the prothesis represented in Geometric art of the Aegean, most notably in the Dipylon Krater.231 Type II stelae are stray finds, with the exception of one from Setefilla, found by Bonsor and Thouvenot in their 1926-1927 excavations, and which apparently 223 M.

Type II stele from Ategua, C6rdoba. (J. Latova, Ministerio de Cultura) covered an inhumation grave.232 The stele was redis- covered on the site in 1973 by Aubet during re-excava- tion of the necropolis. Bendala also would identify the engraving of a "phorminx," a Greek musical instrument of the eighth-sixth centuries B.C., on a stele recently found at Valpalmas (Zaragoza).233 This find is on a north- eastern route from Tartessian territory marked by ste- lae depicting V-type shields from Preixana (Leri- da),234 and Substantion (Montpellier, France).235 No other material evidence of Tartessian cultural contact exists along this inland route. The appearance of the "phorminx" certainly adds credibility to the "Geomet- ric rituals" performed at Tartessian graves, as seen at Ategua. Bendala suggests that other objects depicted on Type II stelae, interpreted as combs or fibulas, could also represent musical instruments. His hypo- thesis is that "early Graeco-Cypriot or Greek (eighth century B.C.) contact with the Iberian Peninsula was in the form of immigration, with settlers bringing with them arms, chariots, ritual and religious customs as well as their funerary practice, music, and some form of writing.""236 CONCLUSIONS Archaeologists working in southern Iberia have dis- covered a series of sites and materials which in all like- lihood represent the civilization of Tartessos. Much remains to be discovered, investigated, and explained, but the main patterns of Tartessian cultural evolution are discernible. The origins are obscure insofar as we must account for the appearance of very fine Geometric ceramics, without previous formative stages, in the Lower Gua- dalquivir and Huelva. Once Phoenicians establish their trading posts, Oriental wares appear in indige- nous Tartessian sites. Population increases during the course of the seventh century B.C. Aspects of material and spiritual context are influenced by the Phoenician presence: regular townplanning begins, the dead are buried with luxury objects of gold, bronze, and ivory in necropoli, figurative iconographic motifs are fa- vored, and a writing system, as yet undeciphered, is introduced. The outstanding discovery of Greek ware at Huel- va (Puerto Street) documents the extensive interaction within the Mediterranean during the first millennium B.C. The appearance of fine Greek ceramics at Tar- 232 There are two other examples (Granja de Cespedes and Solana de Cabafias) which apparently also covered inhuma- tion graves: Almagro Basch (supra n. 223) 27, 105, 201; Bonsor and Thouvenot (supra n. 150) 32. 233 Bendala (supra n. 231) 187, 190; G.

CHAMORRO [AJA 91 tessos is undoubtedly linked to Huelva's wealth in sil- ver and to the availability of gold and tin within Tar- tessian territory. The magnitude of metallurgical operations docu- mented lately by Rothenberg and Blanco-Freijeiro ac- cords well with the phenomenon of coinage in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, and explains the beginning of maritime long-distance trade. The Iberi- an Peninsula itself does not adopt a monetary eco- nomy until 400 B.C. (Emporion) but Tartessos was certainly a main supplier of silver as bullion from the eighth to the sixth century B.C. It seems clear not only that the long-sought splendorous urbs of Tartessos was located under modern Huelva City but also that Tartessian products and way of life prevailed over a wide territory always in contact with the Mediterra- nean world.
