<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay locates in eighteenth-century georgic poetry an attention to zoosemiotics, which interrupts the logo- centric practice of making the animal's ostensible silence grounds for ethical exclusion, and anticipates recent ethological studies of animal communication as well as Derrida's work on animality and the ethical call. Animal Signs and Ethical Significance: Expressive Creatures in the British Georgic TOBIAS MENELY Can the voice of the friend be that of an animal ? - Jacques Derrida, " Eating Well" The presence animals weeping among who stag populate has the an expressive abiding the presence among the expressive animals who populate the West s literary bestiary. In one of Ovid's tales of transfiguration, the huntsmen Actaeon surprises Diana bathing in her forest retreat. In retribution, the goddess of the chase transforms him into a stag, who sobs when he discerns his beastly visage in a still pool. Actaeon's tears are uniquely human, a sign of the trauma of discovering his beastliness made visible and the consequent loss of human privilege, made appar- ent when he is hunted by his own men. Virgil's weeping stag is, by contrast, not a metamorphosized man but a tamed animal. His pathetic tears and the sympathetic response they elicit attest to the affective proximity, rather than distance, between humans and nonhumans. In Book Seven of the Aeneid, the meddling god Juno encourages Aeneas's son, Ascanius, to shoot a stag who had been domesticated by a Mosaic 39/4 0027-1276-06/11 10 18$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">112 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) forest ranger and his daughter Silvia. The injured creature finds his human benefactors and fills their "House with heavy Groans, / Implores their Pity, and his Pain bemoans" (7.698-99). While Actaeon's tears are meant only for himself, affirming the presence of a narcissistically human self within the animal body, in Virgil's account the stag's cries are rhetorical. They assume an interspecies audience, a semiotic community in which groans are intelligible signs of a body's suffering, capable even of instigating sympa- thetic action. Her "household Beast" fatally wounded, Silvia prompts the outraged local swains to scuffle with the Trojans, leading to the war that consumes the second half of the Aeneid (687). The weeping stag frequently reappears in postclassical literature, a figure whose anthropomorphic tears raise questions about how humans recognize and respond to animal expression. In a scene that became a favourite subject for Shakespeare illus- trators including Blake and Constable, Jaques, the man of feeling in As You Like It , shares tears with an injured stag, who "heav'd forth such groans / That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat / Almost to bursting" (2.1.36-37). This sympathetic encounter inspires Jaques, whose passionate nature brings him nearer to the stag while demonstrating his singular humanity, to moralize on sport hunting: "we / Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse, / To fright the animals and to kill them up / In their assign'd and native dwelling-place" (2.1.60-63). The figure appears in the hunting sequence of John Denham's panegyric to Charles I, Cooper's Hill, in Margaret Cavendish's critical rewriting of Denham, "The Hunting of the Stag," which ends with the hart "Shedding some Teares at his owne Funerali " ( 140), and in several eighteenth- century works that probe the moral status of the chase. Alexander Pope published an essay in The Guardian arguing that humans are "accountable for the ill Use" of other creatures (256), which names the chase as one of the cruel customs that define the English character. He specifically animadverts on the practice of delegating to high- born ladies the slaughter of the stag, a "helpless, trembling and weeping Creature" (258). Such customs habituate "inhuman" feelings, which stifle the sympathy that arises from our innate capacity to read the language of animal expression. According to Pope, the likeness of affective signs in a providential world supplies a theological justification for human obligations toward animals: "Perhaps that Voice or Cry so nearly resembling the Human, with which Providence has endued so many Animals, might purposely be given them to move our Pity, and prevent those Cruelties we are too apt to inflict on our Fellow-Creatures" (260). In these works, the stag's expressive groans and pathetic appeal are the basis for a claim of ethical consideration and thus imply a relation, which I reflect on here, between affective communication and interspecies community. My case study is a</page><page sequence="3">Tobias Menely 113 poetic mode, the British georgic, notable for its literal rather than allegorical treat- ment of animals, written in an era, the early eighteenth century, when moral philoso- phers defined bodily sympathies as a primary vehicle of collective identification. Georgic poets recognized an animal world abounding with signs, a natural language of sound and gesture. Their work comprises an episode in literary history when non- humans - including hares, pheasants, nightingales, and earthworms, as well as stags - are depicted as articulate subjects, who draw attention to their torment at human hands. Yet the georgic is also a genre that exalts human agency, the divinely granted prerogative to remake the natural order, which makes it a productive arena for staging the conflict between a performance of human dominion, of which sport hunting is an incontrovertible example, and the animals who resist their fate by imploring sympathetic identification through their body language and cries. In its attention to animal expression and negotiation of the sympathetic identification initi- ated by such expression, the sentimental georgic verse of the early eighteenth century interrupts an intellectual tradition, to which I now turn, that has buttressed its speciesism by silencing the animal. In by The its compulsion Open: Man and to define Animal the Giorgio specific Agamben qualities of characterizes humanity's Western ontological philosophy unique- by its compulsion to define the specific qualities of humanity's ontological unique- ness, to constitute the human by excluding the animal. He attributes this operation to an "anthropological machine" that determines "the border between human and ani- mal" so that a categorical definition of "'man can be decided on and produced" (21). No aptitude has played a larger role in this effort to distinguish human from animal than language. Yet, while it establishes the primary domain of difference, language alone is never sufficient, perhaps because it is evident even to the most anthropocen- tric philosopher that nonhumans express states of being through gesture and vocal- ization. In Theories of the Symbol , Tzvetan Todorov observes that animal cries serve as a troubling test case in classical and scholastic discussions of what constitutes a sign. An animal's cry is, after all, not pain itself but an expression of pain, an intelligible sign of an inward state. Therefore to accomplish the work of setting apart the human, language must be further qualified. In his Politics , for instance, Aristotle holds that "man is the only animal who has the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure and pain, and is therefore found in other animals [. . .] the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and there- fore likewise the just and the unjust" (3). Aristotle defines human language as instru- mental and ethical - elsewhere he describes it as intentional, conventional, and rational - and distinguishes it from the "mere voice" of felt expression. Furthermore,</page><page sequence="4">114 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) abstract speech supplies the grounds for inclusion in ethical community, because, according to the principle of reciprocity, only beings capable of recognizing justice are in turn due justice. All others are "by nature slaves" (10). Aristotle's formulation retained currency among mediaeval and Renaissance thinkers, who either dismissed voces animalium entirely or saw them as an inferior phenomenon, useful primarily for distinguishing what is unique about human language. R.W. Serjeantson describes how early-modern natural philosophers differentiate between articulate speech and a natural language of the passions, a distinction held in place by a series of dichotomies - intentional/reactive, rational/passionate, symbolic/embodied, conventional/ instinctual - that purify humanity's linguistic activity from the bestial. Thomas Hobbes is notorious for exorcising from philosophy another longstand- ing marker of human distinction, the transcendent soul, but, even more forcefully than Aristotle, he equates humanness with articulate speech. Language enters the world when God instructs Adam to name the animals, and, Hobbes conjectures, Adam gave "more names, as the experience and use of the creatures should give him occasion" ( Leviathan 100). Language is invented in an exercise of human dominion, the domestication of animals, and thereafter it categorically differentiates man from brute. Animals cannot speak, and it is through speech that humans overcome their animal nature and establish social institutions: "The most noble and profitable inven- tion [. . .] was that of SPEECH, consisting of the Names or Appellations, and their Connexion; whereby men register their Thoughts; recall them when they are past; and also declare them one to another for mutuali utility and conversation; without which, there had been amongst men, neither Common-wealth, nor Society, nor Contract, nor Peace, no more than amongst Lyons, Bears, and Wolves" (100). There is no com- munity prior to human speech because the natural state is one of perpetual war. Speech constitutes the social world - with symbolic language, we negotiate a social contract - and "distinguish [es] men from all other living creatures" (98-99). Further- more, we have no ethical duties toward animals because they do not enter the realm of linguistic sociability and contractual responsibility: one may reduce "those to servi- tude which by art may be tamed, and fitted for use, and [. . .] persecute and destroy the rest by a perpetuali warre, as dangerous and noxious" (De Cive 8.10). The limited domain of social obligation is negotiated through the human capacity to speak; ethics and language are coextensive. Cultural and literary critics have tended to follow the philosophical tradition in this silencing of nonhumans, concerned as we are with language as the touchstone of human culture. In a reading of Moby-Dick , Philip Armstrong remarks on the limita- tions of a "traditional literary investment in animals as figures for human concerns</page><page sequence="5">Tobias Menely IIS (via fable, allegory, personification, metaphor)," which manifests in a critical recep- tion history in which the whale is solely "a screen for the projection of human mean- ings" (94-96). Interpretive strategies meant for allegorical beast fables are applied to all literary animals, who are read as symbolic substitutes for human beings and human qualities, evacuated of their animal presence. In the prevailing critical climate, to read a literary animal as an animal - to imagine the substantive, experiencing crea- tures who partake of, at times even instigate, literary mediation - is to fall prey to the pathetic fallacy, to commit the sin of anthropomorphism, or to reveal one's naÃ¯vetÃ© about discourse's dominion. Even in recent studies intent on recovering the cultural history of nonhumans, their silence remains axiomatic. In Perceiving Animals : Humans and Beasts in Early Modern English Culture , Erica Fudge claims that, histori- cally, animals "had no voices and left no textual traces" (2). Similarly, in The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age, Harriet Ritvo works from the premise that "Animals [. . .] never talk back" (5). These writers see animals as fully constituted within human discourse, as never themselves articulate subjects. This hermeneutic position follows the linguistic turn, which makes language and society synonymous; both terms establish the limitless domain of human activity, which sub- sumes all nature. Though its intentions are different, the poststructuralist privileging of human textuality is complicit with the philosophical claim that human singularity, and sociability, results from of our capacity to speak. Its self-evident logic offers an instance of what Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard calls a "diffÃ©rend," a case where a party or entity "is divested of the means to argue," is harmed and given no "means to prove the dam- age" (5-9). The perfect crime, Lyotard points out, is one where the victims are silenced, their testimony deemed meaningless, their idiom defined to be without significance. The differendo authority appears nowhere more forcefully than in the history of speciesism, whether a by-product of hermeneutic practice or justified through a phi- losophy of language. In the interview "'Eating Well,' or the Calculation of the Subject," and in his extensive 1997 lecture on the "autobiographical animal," Jacques Derrida has analyzed the anthropocentric logics with which philosophers have justified humanity's absolute sovereignty, exemplified by the "Cartesian tradition of the animal-machine that exists without language and without the ability to respond" ("And Say" 121). Derrida describes both a general silencing of the animal - a fundamental skepticism with regard to the animal sign, which translates into a denial of animal subjectivity - as well as the cataloguing of additional human qualities ostensibly constituted through symbolic language, including desire, the unconscious, the law, and the capac- ity to give. For philosophers such as Kant, Heidegger, and LÃ©vinas, to speak is to be</page><page sequence="6">116 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) deemed a subject and hence to be granted the ethical obligations due to a subject. Derrida's response to this "hegemonic" tradition is surprisingly positivistic. He cites ethological knowledge of the "complexity of 'animal languages'" ("Eating" 285) and asserts that we innately recognize, even if we philosophically dismiss, a corporeal lan- guage of animal expression: "No one can deny the suffering, fear or panic, the terror or fright that humans witness in certain animals" ("Animal" 121). Such communica- tion across species boundaries potentially expands the traditional domain of ethical community. Derrida challenges the doctrinal account of the formation of the ethical subject based on "presence to self," suggesting rather that "responsibility" is instigated by a "call," one not limited by assumptions about the "humanity of language" ("Eating" 274-77). The model for this constitutive address is friendship, which is why Derrida wonders if a friend's voice can be "that of an animal" (278). He indicates an affirmative answer when he argues that deconstructing the "indivisibility of the fron- tier that separates - already with respect to 'us humans' - reaction from response," will put pressure on the "the indivisibility of the concept of responsibility that ensues" ("And Say" 127). Because the definition of man as the speaking animal has had the effect of restricting the sphere of obligation - a sacrificial logic Derrida terms "carno- phallogocentrism" ("Eating" 280) - to allow animals "the call (Ruf) that provokes or convokes 'conscience'" is to extend the bounds of ethical responsibility. Concern is constituted not, as Kant would have it, through rational self-mastery, but rather when another calls out to a perceiving self. Obligation is initiated by interpellation into a semiotic community, by a shared language of "pathos" ("Animal" 120), and, in a biosemiotic world, such community, argues Derrida, is not delimited by humanness. This newfound attention to expressive animals among post-humanists like Derrida, Agamben, and Cary Wolfe, whose Animal Rites follows Derrida's analysis of a logocentrically-justified speciesism, has been paralleled by a resurgence of interest in animal communication among ethologists. In 1872, Darwin published the pioneering book on the subject, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , in which he describes similarities in mammalian expression - he focuses on facial expression, pri- marily in humans, dogs, and cats - and raises questions about the evolution of affec- tive communication and its role in animal societies. As in the Descent of Man , in Expression Darwin proposes that evolutionary continuity extends beyond physiologi- cal traits to encompass behavioural, emotional, and expressive attributes as well. Eileen Crist remarks that Expression "can be read as a philosophical treatise on the availability of mind" as it manifests in the physical expression of affect (28). While the behaviourist assumptions of early twentieth-century biology mandated skepticism regarding animal mind and thus the meaningfiilness of animal signs, the waning of</page><page sequence="7">Tobias Menely 117 behaviourism has encouraged a growing scientific interest in zoosemiotics. Widely- cited research had examined the behaviour of the honeyguide, an African bird who uses vocalizations to lead humans and badgers to beehives; the complex songs and pulses of marine mammals, with their discernable dialects, phrases, and signatures; the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, which referentially differentiate between predators; and the acquisition of human sign language by primates. The Danish philosopher of science Jesper Hoffmeyer has proposed that semiosis is in fact the shared domain of all living nature, an argument comparable to Derridas point that the marks of iterability "without which there would be no language, are themselves not only human" ("Eating" 285). Hoffmeyer reminds us that signification is the vehicle of biological reproduction: DNA is a "coded description" of an organ- ism, that must be interpreted by the egg, in a manner analogous to the relation between a musical score and symphony (29). Mimesis, Hoffmeyer suggests, is not something humans do to nature but something nature does to itself. For animals, sur- vival in a particular ecosystem requires mastery of a "semiotic network" (58), an apti- tude for the production and recognition of signs, which are channelled through "sounds, smells, movements, colors, shapes, electrical fields, thermal radiation, waves of all kind, chemical signals, touching" (vii). Organisms are selected for "patterns of interpretation" as much as any other trait, and in these capacities for "opening up to the world [. . .] of signs" Hoffmeyer sees the origin of subjectivity (58). Like Derrida, Hoffmeyer shows that human language, albeit atypically complex, is just one variety of signification in a semiotic world. Recent teenth-century interest in British animal writers, communication among whom would the universality have been of congenial expression to was eigh- a teenth-century British writers, among whom the universality of expression was a widely observed phenomenon. The period's literature is replete with communicative animals, including Swifts rational equines, the Houyhnhnms, Christopher Smart's miraculously animated cat Jeoffrey, and the woeful ass with whom Tristram Shandy converses on the open road. In 1691, the naturalist John Ray, observing our native capacity to read and respond to animal "significations," denounced the Cartesian evacuation of animal mind: "Should this be true, that Beasts were Automata or Machines, they could have no sense or perception of Pleasure or Pain, and conse- quently no Cruelty could be exercised against them; which is contrary to the doleful significations they make when beaten or tormented, and contrary to the common sense of Mankind, all men naturally pitying them as apprehending them to have such a sense and feeling of Pain and Misery as themselves have" (39). Animals express pas- sions, which we comprehend because of our senses in common. As for Pope, in Ray's</page><page sequence="8">118 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) natural theology, this affective intelligibility and the pity it evokes confirm the provi- dential intention of interspecies sociability and so undermine any anthropocentric defense of human cruelty. For the moral philosopher Lord Shaftesbury, writing contra Hobbes, our ability to understand "signs of joy and contentment" in the "countenances, gestures, voices, and sounds, even of creatures foreign to our kind" offers evidence of our natural social instincts (Cooper 204). In his 1776 animal-rights manifesto, A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and the Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals, the clergyman Humphrey Primati extends the vague imperatives of Shaftesburian sociability into straightforward moral obligations. Primatt s radical call for a legal recognition of ani- mal rights is premised on animal articulateness: the "cries and groans," which "are as strong an indication to us of" an animal's "sensibility of pain, as the cries and groans of a human being, whose language we do not understand" (13-14). A rhetoric of sensibility, which emphasizes such corporeal semiosis, supplied a framework for literary depictions of animal expression. Recent books by Ann Jessie Van Sant and Paul Goring have described how advances in medical science, particu- larly a growing stress on the nervous system and embodied cognition, account for the eloquent human bodies widely noticed by critics of the sentimental novel: the blushes, trembling, tears, fainting spells, and other gestures that make legible the emotional state of characters, bringing interiority to the body's surface. Nonhuman animals talk back in the eighteenth century in part because the widely held principle that man himself must be viewed as an embodied animal - a brain, a bundle of nerves and organs - justified attention to our own extra-linguistic forms of communication. As G.S. Rousseau remarks, "the nerve emerged as the signifier" in every non-transcen- dental theory of "human behavior" (39). Discourses of the nerve explained a variety of uniquely human phenomena, from melancholy to morality, yet were equally appli- cable to animals. Van Sant notes an essential rhetorical similarity between Richardson's Clarissa and Robert Whytt's accounts of animal vivisection: "Both are narratives of suffering; in both, suffering is revelatory" (vii). Bernard Mandeville employs precisely the sort of graphic body language Van Sant has in mind, when, while reflecting on the socialization of cruelty and our innate pity, he demands that we listen to, and look upon, the "Symptoms of Misery" in a dying creature: When a large and gentle Bullock, after having resisted a ten times greater force of Blows than would have kilPd his Murderer, falls stunn'd at last, and his arm'd Head is fastend to the Ground with Cords; as soon as the wide Wound is made, and the Jugulars are cut asun- der, what Mortal can without Compassion hear the painful Bellowings [...], the bitter Sighs that speak the Sharpness of his Anguish, and the deep sounding Grones with loud Anxiety</page><page sequence="9">Tobias Menely 119 fetch'd from the bottom of his strong and palpitating Heart; Look on the trembling and violent Convulsions of his Limbs; see, [. . .] his Eyes become dim and languid, and behold his Smugglings, Gasps and last Efforts for Life, the certain Signs of his approaching Fate? When a Creature has given such convincing and undeniable Proofs of the Terrors upon him, and the Pains and Agonies he feels, is there a Follower of Descartes so inur'd to Blood, as not to refute, by his commiseration, the Philosophy of the vain Reasoner? (173, 180-81) Through its cries and gestures, the bull speaks, signifies, and proves beyond a doubt its interior state, thereby claiming status as a sympathetic victim. The language of sensibil- ity, as Rousseau suggests, migrates from the New Science to the new humanitarianism. Eighteenth-century continuity between empiricism humans and proved animals a fertile nowhere context more for acutely assertions than of in semiotic georgic continuity between humans and animals nowhere more acutely than in georgic poetry. John Dryden's 1697 translation of Virgil's Georgics, published with an adula- tory preface by Joseph Addison, revitalized a genre that conveniently positioned rural life and labour at the heart of national identity in an age of shifting borders, growing metropolitan clout, and expanding global commerce. Stylistically, the georgic stands between the lofty epic and lowly pastoral, and, as scholars have long noticed, media- tion is one of its primary characteristics. Frans De Bruyn sees georgic poetry as work- ing to reconcile "pastoral ease and epic seriousness, sensory appeal and plain instruc- tion, retirement and engagement, cyclical return and historical progress" (661). In Georgic Modernity, Kevis Goodman characterizes the genre by its concern with the mediation of information. In a proliferating media culture, she argues, georgic verse discloses historical "presentness" as it is signaled in a perceptual dissonance caused by information overload (3). This recent preoccupation with georgic mediation is appropriate given that the original georgic poem is concerned with the original media: biosemiotics. The basic principle promoted in Virgils Georgics is that the suc- cessful husbandman must interpret the signs (signa) of an expressive natural order. The poem's opening lines promise to teach the farmer to interpret the heavens and so to place natural signs in the service of culture (tellingly, the Latin sidere denotes both signs and stars). Introducing a recent translation, David Ferry uses terms reminiscent of Hoffmeyer to describe a Virgilian world wherein all creatures are "readers of signs, and signs themselves" (xii). In The Georgics , Virgil shows himself to be an attentive reader of animal signs. He describes the habits of gulls, herons, and ravens, meditates on the impressive cognitive capacities of wild animals, and stresses the teachability of domesticated creatures like dogs and bulls. Eighteenth-century critics admired Virgil as a careful observer of animal life and a forerunner to James Thomson, their own</page><page sequence="10">120 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) nation's master of zoopoetics. In his proto-ecocritical An Essay on the Application of Natural History to Poetry ; John Aikin designates Virgil the ideal naturalist-poet, above all in his observation of animals: "No writer among the ancients appears to have made a more advantageous use of zoological observations than Virgil" (35). Aikin sees Virgil's descriptions of animals as true to nature because they are attentive to an economy of animal feeling, to how animals act and how their actions are expressive of an inner nature, so it comes as no surprise that the observant naturalist Gilbert White identi- fies Virgil as the classical wellspring for his own study of the "life and conversation of animals" (93, emph. mine). The georgic vogue inspired poems on various subjects, from raising sheep to cul- tivating sugarcane, but a surprising number focus on the blood sports enjoyed by the rural gentry: hunting, fishing, and fowling. Four widely read georgic poems published between 1713 and 1735 - Pope's Windsor-Forest, John Gay's Rural Sports , James Thomson's The Seasons , and William Somerville's The Chace - are centrally con- cerned with the arts and ethics of hunting. Though my analysis focuses on the latter two poems, Rural Sports and Windsor-Forest are equally notable for a naturalistic depiction of animal expression that transforms quarry into sympathetic subjects. Both poems emphasize observable evidence of animal experience, particularly signs of human-caused torment, such as "the gasping pains" (Gay 157), "quivering fins" (234), and "convulsive anguish" in a dying fish (252). A pheasant shot by a hunter "feels the fiery Wound, / Flutters in Blood, and panting beats the Ground" (Pope, Windsor 113-14) and a pursued hare exhibits "trembling" terror and emits a "screaming" death cry (Gay 382). Dramatically conveying pain and fear, animals in these poems beseech readerly pity. While both Pope and Gay endorse hunting as a rural custom that subli- mates violent impulses, they also depict hunted animals as experiencing beings, whose gestures and cries demonstrate their suffering. The reader is left in a position of affective and moral uncertainty, his or her sympathy for articulate animals placed in conflict with traditional assumptions about human dominion. The georgic would have been an unwieldy but not insuperable genre for sporting interests had it not been for Thomson's intervention in the hunting debate. Between 1726 and 1746, he published one of the eighteenth century's most popular poems, The Seasons , a work keenly attentive to animal signs and strident in its attack on field sports. Thomson declares his muse to be "most delighted when she social sees / The whole mixed animal creation round / Alive and happy" (3.379-83). Yet signs of animal torment are valid material for a poet who makes humanitarianism a motive for verse. As he castigates those who capture wild birds, Thomson describes how his own moral "music" resonates with animal voices, the listless song of the caged nightingale and the</page><page sequence="11">Tobias Menely 121 bereaved wail of a mother returning to a nest robbed of her offspring. "Be not the Muse ashamed," he writes, acknowledging the literary novelty of his concerns, "to bemoan / Her brothers of the grove by tyrant man / Inhuman caught" (1.702-28). Though The Seasons is an emblematic georgic poem in its attention to the inter- action between the field of human activity and the physical order of nature, Thomson's primary innovation as a poet, as early readers noticed, is in accurately describing natural phenomena based on first-hand observation. Aikin argues that Thomson is Virgil's heir as a proficient observer of the natural order, "particularly [. . .] that part of it which regards the animal creation" ( Essay 57). Animals are not allegorical figures in The Seasons. The stag is not a stand-in for Christ or monarch, as is often the case in Renaissance poetry. Songbirds do not symbolize creative freedom, as they do for Romantic poets. Rather, animals are literal, if also literary, presences: the "tortured worm" on a hook who "[cÄ¼onvulsive twist [s] in agonizing folds" (Thomson 1.388-89), the spaniel "with open nose / Outstretched and finely sensible" (3.364-65), the netted birds who "in vain [. . .] beat / Their idle wings" (370-71), the hunted stag whose "once so vivid nerves / So full of buoyant spirit, now no more / Inspire the course" (449-51). Thomson discovers in the natural world a rich semiology: visible and audible signs of animal affect. The Seasons teems with voluble, animated creatures. Bird song, for instance, is variously an expression of "joy" (1.589) or com- petition, a warning, a lament, a vehicle for flirtation and pair bonding. The central motive for animal communication is reproduction, a subject Thomson follows Virgil in foregrounding. The "voice of love" is found in "birds and beasts" alike (616), and the pressure of selection requires that the vocal "arts of pleasing" be "inventive" (616-18). Through body language and vocalization, animals convey pain as well as pleasure. When the steed is "provoked, / [. . .] his big sinews full of spirit swell / Trembling with vigour" (506-8). Even a fly caught in a spider's web may "declare extreme distress" through its "fluttering wing / And shriller sound" (2.278-79). Thomson represents ani- mals as subjects whose affective lives are recognizable and comparable to our own. The display of these expressive bodies is not just descriptive. Thomson's readers are meant to sympathize with the creatures whose inner states they have access to. Unlike Gay and Pope, who position readers in a space of moral ambiguity, Thomson's aim is straightforwardly didactic: to inveigh against cruelty, instigate sympathy, and lessen animal suffering. The poem's characteristic strategy for inspiring empathetic identification is to telescope in on an isolated and sympathetically available subject, creating a pathetic image capable of moving readers. In the Autumn hunting sequences, for instance, human agency, be it destructive or sympathetic, is contrasted with the visible helplessness and fear of the "weak and harmless" quarry (424), the</page><page sequence="12">1 22 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) "miserable prey" (986). Thomson enlarges the traditional definition of animal suffer- ing to include psychological torment as well as physical pain. In "Summer," the heat of midday silences all creatures except: The stock-dove [who] through the forest coos, Mournfully hoarse; oft creasing from his plaint, Short interval of weary woe! again The sad idea of his murdered mate, Struck from his side by savage fowler's guile, Across his fancy comes; and then resounds A louder song of sorrow through the grove. (2.615-21) The stock-dove and its mate are sentimentalized victims, particular cases that stand synecdochically for an animal creation tormented by the sportsman. These pitiable animals, in fact, establish the conventions of performative distress and sympathetic spectatorship that come to structure the sentimental novel, which makes its "primal scene," as Margaret Cohen observes, "a spectacle of suffering that solicits the specta- tor's sympathy" (108). In his 1777 Strictures , Critical and Sentimental John More includes a long section on Thomson's "pathetic" treatment of the "sufferings of creatures," who are "in so many important respects on a level with ourselves" (219). Among the most affecting episodes is the hunting of the stag, an "elegant and masterly creature that wonderful- ly instructs the reader in his safety" (224-25). Mores analysis is telling in its attribu- tion of didactic agency to the stag and its implication that the primary interaction mediated in Thomson's hunting scenes is between quarry and reader. Thomson's stag- hunt, for example, is unusual in its elimination of the hunting party from the entire sequence. The animal's tears are accessible only to the reader, who is positioned as a sympathetic voyeur, looking on as the terrified creature flees from the dogs. The read- er's pity is called forth early in the scene, when the hart "sobbing sees / The glades" where he once struggled with "his butting friends" and won his love (3.441-44). The hunt's denouement has "big round tears run down his dappled face" as the dogs attack and tear him to pieces (454). The absence of the hunting party from the entire scene authenticates the stag's emotional expression, which appears private and spontaneous even as it appeals to the collective sympathies of a community of readers. More completely than any earlier poem in English, The Seasons depicts nonhu- man animals as subjective beings, whose capacity to express inner states underlies their ethical claims. Thomson intervenes in the affective social sphere constituted within an expanding print culture, aiming to reform society by cultivating sentimental norms</page><page sequence="13">Tobias Menely 123 and de-legitimating retrograde customs, like cruel field sports. He does not so much give voice to animal victims as he relays and anthropomorphically accentuates their voices, shepherding readers into a virtual countryside so as to reveal the cruel practices occurring in the real one. The Seasons suggests that advocacy is a matter of expanding the reach of voices making their own appeal, so it makes sense that the period's most vociferous animal-rights polemic is entitled The Cry of Nature, the frontispiece of which shows a deer weeping over her butchered fawn, and that today's animal-rights activists publicize graphic photographs and videos of the goings-on in abattoirs and laboratories. More specifically, Thomson s sentimental didacticism, his effort to con- test blood sports by conveying the needless suffering they cause, supplied a template for later anti-hunting poetry, including John Aldingtons A Poem on the Cruelty of Shooting, William Cowper's The Task and William Wordsworth's "Hart-leap Well." In fact, The Seasons establishes the formula - positioning its audience near the forest's personable and performative denizens as they respond to a malevolent human pres- ence - for the twentieth century's most powerful polemic against hunting, wherein a young stag tearfully mourns his mother's death at the hands of sportsmen: Disney's 1942 film Bambi. While earlier poets used the georgic to reflect on field sports as a moral problem worthy of national debate, William Somerville, a gentleman with a large estate in Warwickshire, published The Chace in 1735 with the intention of justifying the hunt. This rhetorical ambition was hindered by the cultural politics of the period's highly controversial game laws, which limited sport hunting to the landed gentry and legis- lated harsh penalties for poachers, but also by the overdetermining influence of Thomson's sentimental georgic naturalism. Like most literate Britons, Somerville read The Seasons; he even wrote a verse epistle, "To Mr. Thomson, On the First Edition of his Seasons." Although The Chace contests Thomson's critique of hunting, Somerville borrows copiously from The Seasonsy particularly its richly depicted zoosemiotics. The poem's sheer exuberance of emotional expression destabilizes its anthropocentric imperatives. In a 1796 preface to The Chace y John Aikin diagnoses Somerville's rhetor- ical problem: the unsuitability of pathos in a poem that recommends the pleasure of killing animals. In the fox-hunting sequence, certain "pathetic incidents [. . .] appear rather incongruous in a scene which is represented as inspiring the 'madness of delight'" (16). In other words, the pathos inspired by expressive animals undermines the poem's intention of defending the pleasures of gentlemanly hunting against grow- ing public criticism. Like Thomson, Somerville is a skilled conveyer of animal expression who teaches his readers to interpret body language and vocalization. Detailed attention to physical</page><page sequence="14">124 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) conduits of sensation - the heart, veins, nerves, blood, nostrils, eyes, and skin - trans- forms animals into somatically legible subjects. Somerville employs verbs that attest to subjective states, linking observable action and inner affect. In the poem, animals tremble, quiver, shake, pant, faint, swell, growl, cower, skulk, cry, sob, whine, stretch, frolic, bask, glare, grin, and creep. Sense details signify affective experience: sounds like "imperfect Whimp'rings" (1.225) and "dying Shrieks" (3.470); visual cues like waving tails and "Eyes / With Life full-beaming"; and even smells, such as the scent particles that emanate from the frightened quarry and hang in the air for the hounds, who "with ev're Breath / Inhale the grateful Stream, quick pleasures sting / Their tin- gling Nerves" (2.141-42). Animals do not just feel in Somerville's rendering; they feel in recognizably human ways. Among the specific named emotional states ascribed to other creatures are joy, courage, ardour, ecstasy, timorousness, fear, hope, disappoint- ment, rage, fury, jealousy, sadness, despair, horror, woe, and anguish. Somerville feels no compunction about emphasizing the affective continuity between humans and other creatures, and he even advocates the gentle treatment of dogs and horses. It is, however, the hunted animals, the fox, otter, hare, and stag, who are given the fullest emotional lives and with whom the reader is made to identify most fully. The hare-hunting sequence offers one example. As the hunt commences, the reader's attention is turned toward the visibly frightened hare: "there she lies; how close! she pants, she doubts / If now she lives; she trembles as she sits, / With Horror seiz'd" (2.137-39). During the chase sequence, the reader's point of view shuttles between the crazed and "blood-thirsty" dogs and the obviously distressed hare, whose eventual death is pathetic, in both senses: "How quick she turns! their gaping Jaws eludes, / And yet a Moment lives; 'till round inclos'd / By all the greedy Pack, with infant Screams / She yields her Breath, and there reluctant dies" (2.269-72). The effect of this final humanization of the "poor" hare, the reference to her human cry, is accentuated when her fate is compared with the "poor ill-fated Bard," Orpheus, who was pursued and killed by the raging Maenads (2.273-80). As if to compensate for this pitiable scene, Somerville immediately moves to an account of the Mughal emperor Aurengzebe's glorious slaughter of malicious lions and tigers. The poem's rhetorical excess and inconsistency - its harried justifications for human dominion and clumsy commingling of epic, mock-heroic, and pathetic ele- ments - index the poet's anxiety that a reader taught to interpret the language of ani- mal feeling may well end up antagonistic to his cruel custom. This anxiety accounts for Somerville's revision of Denham's version of the royal stag hunt at Windsor Forest. As he has with other quarry, Somerville depicts the stag as a sympathetic sub- ject, an active and expressive being, who is "wrung with Anguish," "lifts his weary</page><page sequence="15">Tobias Menely 125 Limbs with Pain," and "sobs apall'd" (3.475, 508-9). The reader sees events from the stag's perspective as he flees the hunting party and hides in a stream before being trapped and attacked by dogs. Somerville follows closely Denham's sequencing of events, until the final scene, when the stag stands before the monarch, an exemplary sentimental tableau, and makes a now familiar rhetorical appeal: "Beneath a Weight of Woe he groans distress'd: / The Tears run trickling down his hairy Cheeks; / He weeps" (593-95). Whereas Denham's stag is shot by King Charles, in Somerville's ren- dering the nameless monarch, with "Tenderness innate," pities the creature and calls off the dogs (596). A reader intent on demystifying sentimentality, on showing that pity is always a form of power, would interpret the royal pardon as a celebration of monarchical sovereignty. I would suggest, rather, that the stag's tears exert their own rhetorical force - a call that constitutes a sentimental reader - within a moral economy defined by affective sociability. To put this another way, the stag's reprieve is a conse- quence of Somerville's failure to spell out a rationale for dominion that outweighs the sympathetic reader's investment in the animal's survival. It reflects not a king's mercy so much as the emergence of a humanitarian reading public attentive to expressive animals. In the poems I have discussed, an unusually acute attentiveness to a wider semi- otic world has the effect of troubling the human dominion otherwise celebrated in georgic verse. In Thomson's The Seasons , we see the development of a sentimental rhetoric of semiotic proximity and a publicizing of expressive suffering that mark the emergence of modern animal advocacy. Somerville's The Chace , on the contrary, inad- vertently demonstrates the rhetorical challenge of denying communal membership to beings who communicate subjective states and interests. It shows why the philosophi- cal disavowal of responsibility toward animals has so often taken the form of the dif- fÃ©rend or silencing. To signify, to express one's inner state, to state one's interests, to cry out, is, as Derrida argues, to call forth ethical obligation. Language exceeds (and pre- cedes) humanness, so the history of our dealings with other species is a text interwov- en with traces of the outsides - corporeal, affective, animal - that are excluded so as to constitute the human and justify our sovereignty. For deists like Ray and Thomson, shared articulateness reflects the intentions of a benevolent designer: a providential world where animal signs convey ethical obligations. In our post-Darwinian world, zoosemiotics reveal a common evolutionary heritage but bear no transcendental imperatives. Yet, if we take Derrida's point that ethical subjectivity is constituted through the voice of another, we see why an ethical relation to nonhumans continues to commence with attention to affective signs like and unlike our own.</page><page sequence="16">126 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) WORKS CITED Agamben, Giorgio.
