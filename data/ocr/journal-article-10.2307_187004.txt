<plain_text><page sequence="1">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III LARRY WRIGHT University of California, Riverside It is commonly thought that the dispositional view of purposiveness is itself incom- patible with the programmatic claims of neurophysiologists. In this paper, various versions of four arguments for this incompatibility are examined, and rejected as un- sound. Central to the argument is a rough sketch of a "mechanistic" position which seems clearly compatible with a dispositional view of purposiveness. Many recent action theorists, following Gilbert Ryle, have come to view pur- posive behavior as broadly dispositional. In general, this may come to no more than a recognition that we must have some way to express the variability of teleo- logical responses to the same circumstances. Some things, we like to say, are "disposed" to behave one way, some another, under a given set of conditions. In the very same circumstances, a purposive system will sometimes behave in one way, sometimes another, depending on what goal it has, or whether it has any at all. It is natural in light of this to think of purposive behavior as resulting from variable, active dispositions: natural tendencies to behave in certain ways. There is much to recommend this position. If we view purposive behavior as dispositional in this way, many aspects of this behavior and its explanation which seem intractable from other perspectives, fall intelligibly into place. However, I am here not primarily concerned to argue the case for the dispositional interpretation of purposiveness. My primary aim will be to show that one consequence often drawn from this interpretation does not follow from it: namely, that explaining a bit of behavior by invoking purpose is inconsistent with discovering that the behavior is the product of an underlying mechanism.1 There are four reasonably distinct arguments in the literature linking the dis- positional picture with antimechanism. I will consider each of these arguments in turn in an attempt to show that they all fail. In the process of developing this negative argument, I hope to show how a mechanistic position might be elaborated consistently with the dispositional interpretation of purpose. PART I The first two arguments are general and may be discussed independently of any specific analysis of purposive dispositions. 1. Noncontingency. A. It has seemed to some commentators that the very nature of purposive dispositions disallows the possibility of any kind of mechanism under- lying behavior accounted for in those terms. For, they argue, the fundamental * Received December, 1973. 1 In this context, 'mechanism' refers to any sort of underlying, structural account of the behavior in question, from electronic feedback devices to neurophysiological theory. 345</page><page sequence="2">LARRY WRIGHT explanatory principle invoked in such accounts is not a contingent proposition, but rather a matter of logical necessity. And it seems ludicrous to suggest that there could be a mechanism underlying-offering a further explanation of-a tautology. The noncontingency of the basic explanatory principle here is developed in this way: to say that someone wants something is to say that he is disposed to do it or get it ... that his desiring it issuing in the appropriate action neither requires nor admits of explanations, while the actions not ensuing demand that we adduce some countervailing factor if we are to maintain the claim that he wants the thing concerned. ([7], p. 38) So, in the absence of countervailing factors, it is logically impossible to explain his not doing or getting the thing in question; which means we were wrong to say he wanted it. The same argument applies to the other action-dispositions. Now the antimechanists contend that to ask for an underlying explanation here is to ask why the appropriate behavior follows from desire or intent, in the absence of countervailing factors. And, of course, from this perspective that is to ask why a tautology is true. So mechanism seems ruled out on logical grounds. Although this is still the subject of some controversy,2 I take it to be at least plausible to maintain that the connection between wanting or intending to do X and, in the absence of all countervailing factors, doing X, is one of logical necessity. If this is mistaken, it is not an important mistake in this context; and I will accept the proposition for the following argument. The crucial mistake lies in the argument from this, to the incompatibility of intentional and underlying, mechanistic explanations of human behavior. The antimechanistic position we are examining here has, rather naturally I think, been usually taken to be hostile to the program of current neurophysiology. And although other interpretations are possible, this is the interesting one for our purposes. The neurophysiologists are aiming at a nonteleological account of what is "really going on when human beings act," what is "really" at the bottom of it. They are seeking "the physiological processes under- lying human behavior." This in turn sounds like the sort of account the anti- mechanist is concerned to rule out. It is important to make this point explicitly, precisely because the noncontingency move fails to engage the programmatic claims of mechanistic neurophysiologists. True, they are trying to find an underlying mechanistic account of human behavior. The mistake lies in characterizing their activity as attempting to account for the fact "that the behavior follows from the intention other things being equal." Of course they are not attempting to give a mechanistic account of an action tautology. And accounting for the behavior referred to in the tautology does not require them to. How is this possible? It is well known that dispositions of a less controversial sort-e.g. solubility, brittleness, ferromagnetism, soporific power, and the like-can and do have under- lying, structural explanations. We can, e.g. offer an explanation of the brittleness of 2 See, e.g. [9], p. 272. 346</page><page sequence="3">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III something by appeal, say, to molecular bonding regularities. Furthermore, these bonding regularities can be directly appealed to, to explain the fracturing of the object in question (when hit) without explicitly appealing to the brittleness. It is interesting to note what this does not show. First, it does not show that there is no brittleness-disposition; the disposition still exists, the object still passes the brittle- ness-tests, we just have a better understanding of the disposition than we did before. Second, underlying explainability does not show that explanations can no longer be usefully given in terms of the disposition itself: in most contexts in which a dis- positional explanation was previously adequate, it will still be adequate; the additional complexity, as before, is irrelevant, and hence anti-explanatory. ("How come you are so fearful of falling?" "My bones have grown brittle in my old age.") Third, exactly the same case can be made for a noncontingent link between brittleness and actual breakage in certain circumstances (proper blow plus absence of countervailing factors) as has been made for action-dispositions; and accepting this characteristic noncontingency in no way discomfits an underlying, structural account of the brittleness. Were there underlying structural regularities they would provide a contingent guarantee of the disposition, and hence of the appropriate breakage, in the proper circumstances. But this is consistent with the proposition that if the explanation begins with the disposition itself, instead of merely a con- tingent guarantee of it, the explanatory principle is tautological. The proper view of the matter is to see the disposition as a manifestation of the underlying regularities. And sometimes, that we can count on the manifestation is all we need to know for an explanation. Similarly, the fact that dispositions to behave in certain teleological ways play an important role in human behavior is not in the least incompatible with a mechanistic account of that behavior. A mechanistic account of human behavior would, of course, concern itself with the causal antecedents and physiological cor- relates of action-dispositions (inter alia): the mechanism should manifest itself in those dispositions. Ideally, mechanistic antecedents and correlates would occur in regularities which would provide a contingent, empirical guarantee of the dis- positions, and hence provide the same sort of guarantee of the appropriate behavior, in the absence of countervailing factors. But none of this is inconsistent with the proposition that if you start with the dispositions themselves, rather than merely a causal guarantee of them, the behavior, in the absence of countervailing factors, follows with logical necessity. Action explanations, that is, explanations in terms of purposes, intentions, desires and the like, start with the dispositions themselves. Accordingly, the noncontingency argument fails when it is construed as interestingly antimechanistic. B. There is another sort of noncontingency argument in the literature, which is sometimes used in conjunction with the one we have been examining. And although it is perhaps difficult to see how this argument could be understood as an argument against mechanism, it has been so understood in some places. So it is worth brief consideration here. The very clearest statement of the issue is one by Norman Malcolm, in which he distinguishes between intentions formed prior to the action 347</page><page sequence="4">which is their object, and other intentions which are not. The former, he allows, can have an unproblematically causal role in the explanation of human action, but the latter, which he calls 'concurrent simple intentions', are another story: ... many simple intentions are not formed in advance of the corresponding action. Driving a car, one suddenly (and intentionally) presses the brake pedal: but there was no time before this action occurred when one intended to do it. The intention existed only at the time of the action, or only in the action. Let us call this a merely concurrent simple intention. Can an intention of this kind be a causal factor in the corresponding action ? Here we have to remember that if the driver did not press the brake inten- tionally, his pressing of the brake was not unqualified action. The presence of simple intention in the action (that is, its being intentional) is an analytically necessary condition for its being unqualified action. This condition is not a cause but a defining condition of unqualified action. ([3], pp. 60-61) So once again, since the link between the action and its explanatory principle is not causal, but rather definitional, there cannot be any mechanistic explanation under- lying this one. Now, although the contrast between defining conditions and causal antecedents is a very useful one in many contexts, it is being abused in this argument. Previously formed simple intentions, to which Malcolm does allow a causal role, have exactly the same status as defining conditions of the actions they explain: the behavior in question could not be called action unless it had been brought about by an intention. What is defining of action here is not "the intention" simpliciter. What is defining is "that the intention was involved in bringing about the behavior." The causal role of intention is not only consistent with its role in the definition of action, it is required by that definition. If we were to use the term 'raccident' to refer to that subset of automobile accidents which were caused by loss of adhesion in the rain, it would be true to say that rain was a defining condition of raccidents. But that would not mean that rain was thereby excluded from playing a causal role in raccidents. For raccidents just are the class of accidents in which rain plays a causal role. And it plays a causal role in that class, by definition. Pointing out this fact may help reduce the temptation to misconstrue this uncontentious observation about defining conditions as an argument against mechanism. 2. Rivalry. Considerations closely related to these help display the error in a com- mon but unsophisticated formulation of the second argument for antimechanism we shall consider. This argument maintains that since any mechanical explanation underlying allegedly purposive behavior would presumably provide sufficient conditions for the occurrence of that behavior, it follows that the behavior would have occurred, given the mechanical parameters, even if the purposive characteriza- tion had been false. Consequently, we would be wrong to invoke purposes in explaining the (occurrence of the) behavior even in the cases in which intentions and purposes are present. Perhaps it is best to let a proponent sketch the argument. 348 LARRY WRIGHT</page><page sequence="5">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEIAVIOR III We will recall that the envisaged neurophysiological theory was supposed to provide sufficient causal explanations of behavior. Thus the movements of the man on the ladder would be completely accounted for in terms of electrical, chemical, and mechanical processes in his body. This would surely imply that his desire or intention to retrieve his hat had nothing to do with his movement up the ladder. It would imply that on this same occasion he would have moved up the ladder in exactly this way even if he had had no intention to retrieve his hat, or even no intention to climb the ladder. To mention his intention or purpose would be no explanation, nor even part of an explanation, of his movements on the ladder. Given the antecedent neurological states of his bodily system together with general laws correlating those states with the contractions of muscles and movements of limbs, he would have moved as he did regardless of his desire or intention. If every movement of his was com- pletely accounted for by his antecedent neurophysiological states (his "prog- ramming"), then it was not true that those movements occurred because he wanted or intended to get his hat. ([3], pp. 52-53) Now the first thing to notice here is that "it would have happened anyway" is not an adequate rejoinder to a causal claim-in spite of its classic credentials. There is an inexhaustible supply of overdetermination examples-simultaneous, sequential, linked or independent-manifesting virtually any logical property we wish, in which the effect would have happened even if what we rightly pick out as the cause had not been present. "He would have died even if the bullet had missed his heart: there was a cerebral haemorrhage under way at the time." And although this sort of case might seem completely irrelevant at first, it is not. For these cases show most clearly that what is important in saying that B occurred because of A is not anything simply formulable in terms of necessary or sufficient conditions, but rather something much more complicated. And, accordingly, all that was said in the previous section about different levels of explanation, and the picture of dis- positions as manifestations of underlying structural regularities cannot be dis- comfited by anything so facile as "it would have happened anyway." Furthermore, if we accept the "manifestation" view of the previous section as the plausible elaboration of the mechanist position, Malcolm's subjunctive con- ditional suddenly becomes opaque. It is one of those counterfactuals which really does leave us up in the air. "If Vermont and Georgia were adjacent, then Georgia would be a northern state." It is just not clear. There are an indefinitely large num- ber of geographic changes which would juxtapose Vermont and Georgia; but in only a fraction of those cases would it be accurate to say that Georgia was a northern state: in some it would remain in the south, in others the north/south distinction would be without clear sense. Similarly, suppose we do find a structural state S which manifests itself in a disposition D toward behavior B, and that S together with some other parameters P is sufficient for B. Given just this much, it is simply not clear whether S and P would still be sufficient for B if things were such that S no longer manifested itself in D. If we were to change things so radically that S no longer manifested itself in D, what reason do we have to suppose that we would 349</page><page sequence="6">LARRY WRIGHT not thereby change the role of S vis-a-vis sufficient conditions for B ? A priori, there are none; and presumably the argument is not the result of empirical research. Obviously it is not self-contradictory to say that an S which does not manifest itself in D is, when taken together with P, sufficient for B. But this only shows that B could (logically) have happened anyway, not that it would (in fact) have happened anyway. And it is the latter claim which is relevant to the explanatory connection in dispute here. What seemed like a truism turns out to be a very difficult and con- tentious claim indeed. It's like arguing that when you burned your hand on the fireplace poker, it happened not because the poker was hot, but rather because the mean kinetic energy of the poker's particles was very high; for high mean kinetic energy would be sufficient to burn you even if it were not related to high tempera- ture. The mind boggles. Given this much there is simply no reason to prefer the apodosis clause of the counterfactual conditional to its negation. There is no reason to suppose it would have happened anyway. A more circumspect statement of the argument is given by Charles Taylor: ... if a given piece of behaviour is rightly classified as an action, then we cannot account for it by some causal antecedent, where the law linking ante- cedent (E) to behaviour (B) is not itself conditional on some law or rule governing the intention or purpose. For if the law linking E to B were not dependent on some law linking E and the intention or purpose, I, to do B, then E-B would hold whether or not E-I held. But then B would occur on E whether the corresponding intention was present or not. And then, even when it is present, it cannot be said to bring about the behaviour, so long as this is done by E. Thus to account for B in terms of E would be to offer a rival account, to disqualify B as an action. ([7], pp. 34-35; italics added) This is a particularly interesting statement, because it has misled a number of people who have written on this topic, myself and Taylor among them. If Taylor will allow that the "manifestation" picture I have sketched above provides an E-B relationship which "... is itself conditional on some law or rule governing the intention or purpose," then he has not provided an argument against at least one very plausible form of mechanism; the standard neurophysiological reduc- tionist position escapes his attack. On the other hand, Taylor does say many things, both before and after the quoted passage, which makes it pretty clear that he takes any sort of underlying "programming" regularity to represent an E-B relation- ship of the offending kind (see especially pp. 20, 40 and 41). But on this interpreta- tion Taylor's argument becomes subject to the same criticism as Malcolm's less careful formulation; it is merely a complicated way of saying it would have happened anyway. On either reading Taylor's argument does not succeed against the mechanistic position we have been examining. Implicit in the last passage from Taylor is a slightly different formulation of this argument, which has found some acceptance in the literature and deserves a brief comment. It is sometimes charged that an underlying structural (e.g. neuro- physiological) theory of the sort sketched in the previous section, one which did not make explicit use of the action dispositions themselves, would of necessity 350</page><page sequence="7">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III govern movements rather than action. Hence a theory of that sort could not be called upon to explain action as opposed to behavior which was mere movement. There is just enough cogency in this charge to mislead sanguine commentators into thinking they have made a point against the possibility of mechanism. A neuro- physiological theory of the sort envisaged above could well be guilty of this charge when understood in a certain way. For although some of the movements it purports to explain would in fact result from action dispositions, the theory would not have to distinguish them as such. Behavior resulting from all sorts of dispositions could be lumped together with action in such a theory: e.g. subconscious (death wish), unconscious (sleep walking), instinctual (punch ducking), internal-organic (homeo- stasis), even hypnotic and reflex behavior. For an adequate account of some event in my life, a neurophysiological theory would merely have to produce the physio- logical parameters in virtue of which I was disposed to behave in a certain way- and enough else to rule out countervailing factors. It could contain something in its algorithmic/theoretic details corresponding to 'this is an action-disposition' (something about consciousness and goal-directedness), but it need not. From its point of view, the behavior could be occurring while I was asleep or under hypnosis, or it could be reflex. A disposition is a disposition, a guarantee a guarantee. All the underlying account requires is that, e.g. intent be inter alia a disposition; precisely what the alia are does not matter. But this does not mean that in the context in which the distinguishing features of these dispositions are interesting, they cannot be distinguished. They can, and sometimes should-underlying explainability not- withstanding. What the underlying theory explains are actions, even if nothing within the theory distinguishes them as such. Just as (part of) what the electro- magnetic theory of light accounts for are individual colors, although nothing within the theory distinguishes them as such. PART II The other two antimechanistic arguments I wish to consider arise in their clearest forms when an attempt is made to distinguish purposive dispositions from the more straightforward ones. In what follows I will argue briefly for, and then adopt a certain analysis of purposiveness. I do this both for expository simplicity and because I think the analysis is correct. However, the argumentative points do not stand or fall with the analysis. I think it will be clear that any analysis of roughly the same type will allow prosecution of the same argument, or one to the same effect. Following Charles Taylor [7], I think that what differentiates teleological dis- positions from ordinary ones (solubility, brittleness, etc.) is nothing more than the form of the feature on which they make the behavior depend. The usual sort of nonteleological disposition, found, e.g. in natural science, makes the behavior it explains dependent3 upon a reasonably straightforward antecedent condition: being placed in a liquid, hit with a hard object, etc. By contrast, behavior resulting from a 3 The notion of dependency here should not be taken to indicate a sufficient condition. Something like the standard, causal, ceteris paribus clause is implicit. 351</page><page sequence="8">LARRY WRIGHT teleological disposition depends upon antecedents which are systematically less straightforward, antecendents which are related to (and specifiable in terms of) the consequences of the behavior itself in a definite, but sometimes very convoluted and elaborate way. In other words, on this interpretation, teleological behavior is behavior with a special kind of etiology (to steal a term from medicine), not behavior with something other than an etiology. In several places, Taylor has argued that the peculiarly teleological etiologies are requirement-etiologies: behavior occurs for the sake of some goal if it occurs because it is required for that goal, with some pretty tough restrictions on 'because' and a highly qualified 'requires'. (In other words, the form of antecedent charac- teristic of purposive dispositions would be: things are such that the behavior in question is required for a certain goal.) I have argued elsewhere [10], that this formulation will not do, for a number of reasons, and have offered a slightly different one in terms of 'consequence-etiologies': B occurs for the sake of G4 if, (i) B tends to bring about G (T) (ii) B occurs because it tends to bring about G. (Let me refer to this formulation as '(T)'.) In this formulation (i) is understood as including all the stronger B-G causal relationships, B always brings about G, B typically brings about G, etc.; and the 'because' in (ii) is taken to be the ordinary causal one. I have broken (T) into two somewhat redundant parts in order to make trans- parent how empiricistically orthodox it is to demonstrate that (T) holds of any behavior B (i.e. to show that the thing manifesting B has G as a goal/is disposed to behave teleologically toward G at a certain time). We must begin, of course, with B described nonteleologically (a specific path, say, or a geometrical pattern). Then (Ti) specifies a variable property of B on which its occurrence must depend if it is to satisfy (T), and (Tiii) merely expresses that dependence. Given a physico- geometrically described B, whether or not it will have property (Ti) will depend on all sorts of features of the environment. So we can, by appropriately controlling the environment, control which B's have property (Ti). Hence it is a rather standard experimental design problem to determine whether some system S is manifesting behavior which depends on (Ti). Using ordinary experimental techniques, ran- domization, variable matching, Mill's methods, and so forth, we should be able to determine whether a certain B occurs because it will tend to bring about G or not. The evidential picture should not look very different from the one demonstrating that Jimmy caught measles from Johnny. Of course, the key variable property sounds funny to the philosophical ear: What is it like for some specific B to tend to bring about G, as opposed to just bringing it about? I have discussed this in all its elaborate anthropomorphic detail in [10], but one thing which would satisfy (Ti) is a B which guarantees G. That would be enough. Less clearly specifiable illustra- 4 take the expressions 'B in order that G' and 'B has the goal G' to be equivalent to 'B for the sake of G' for my purposes, and will use all three interchangeably. 352</page><page sequence="9">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III tions of (Ti) involve us in considerations concerning the reliability of rather com- plex perceptions, but nothing methodologically novel. Clearly, then, (if we can presume (T), or something very like it) the demonstra- tion of the goal-directedness of something's behavior does not involve us at all in a discussion of the internal structure of that something. There is nothing within (T) or its demonstration which would prevent its application to a system S because of its internal nature. S could be an organism, a mechanism, a lump of quartz or a forest fire; so long as what S did could be shown to depend on its having certain conse- quences, S's behavior is teleological. But this alone does not show that S cannot have an inner nature, or B an underlying structure which will offer an explanation of B in terms of its independent antecedents, rather than its consequences; for example, one in mechanical or neurophysiological terms. It is relatively easy to state the general conditions an underlying mechanistic account of S must meet in order to guarantee that S's behavior satisfy (T). S's manifesting behavior Bo in environment E would be explained mechanistically by appeal to the intrinsic5 state description (SE)o. S and E being in (SE)o would cause (i.e. make S do) Bo. However, S would be (or be designed) such that the Bo it manifests in (SE)o would always satisfy (Ti). This is to say that S always does what tends to bring about G. Feedback mechanisms, of course, are clear illustrations of this scheme. They are mechanically geared to their surroundings in such a way that, at least in some environments (e.g. after the missile is released in the presence of an appropriate target), the behavior the mechanism causes them to manifest will always be something which tends to bring about some particular goal (e.g. the missile and the target being in the same place). It seems to follow that teleological behavior, goal-directed behavior, not only legitimately can, but sometimes actually does have an underlying intrinsic-mechanistic explanation. Sometimes it is the product of an underlying mechanism. 3. Causes vs. Correlates and the Uniqueness of Explanation. But even at this point it could be objected that I have run roughshod over some important distinctions; that there is something wrong with calling the behavior teleological, something wrong with saying it satisfies (T), if it is actually being produced by such a mechanism. For, it might be urged, its tendency to bring about G is not what is bringing about Bo in this case. What is really producing Bo is (SE)o, which is specifiable without appeal to Bo's consequences; so Bo is really being brought about nonteleologically. Bo's tending to bring about G is merely an empirical correlate of its cause, and hence cannot be called upon to explain Bo's occurrence. It is like trying to explain the searing of my hand by appeal to the redness of the hot coal, as opposed to its heat. This position represents a sophisticated reworking of argument 2. in the context of a specific analysis of purposive dispositions, and parallels a central theme in the standard responsibility vs. determinism controversy. It is important to raise this objection here because it displays a fundamental 5 This is Taylor's term, which he defines: ".. . . without making any reference to ... goals, e.g. by simply enumerating the components or by mentioning certain key stimuli which are impinging on ... receptors" ([7], p. 12). From our perspective, this term most importantly restricts considerations to things other than the consequences of Bo. 353</page><page sequence="10">misunderstanding of both cause and explanation, which, it seems to me, lies behind much of the confusion this subject has generated. It is certainly true, as this objec- tion presumes, that there is a very close relationship between cause and explanatori- ness: to give a cause is to give an explanation. However, as several philosophers have elaborately shown, choosing the explanatory factor-the cause-from among a number of empirical correlates, be they general, contextual or accidental, is a subtle, conceptually complicated and enormously context-dependent business. The rules, if they are ever articulated, will not be anything like as straightforward as this objection requires. In a vessel of gas we can sometimes explain the rise in pressure by appeal to a rise in temperature, and sometimes vice versa. It all depends on the particular circumstances, details of the context. Did we light the burner under the tank, or, alternatively, admit more gas? And if the vessel explodes following such a rise, we will sometimes explain it by appeal to temperature, sometimes by pressure, and sometimes by a weak seam in the vessel, depending on the situation. What the question, "Why did it explode ?" asks in different cases will vary. What makes the hot coal example persuasive is, as Douglas Gasking has pointed out in [1], the contingent fact that while we can make a coal red by making it hot, nothing we know of counts as making it hot by making it red. It is a question of manipulability. If we could make coals hot by directly manipulating their color, this case would be rather like the gas vessel, and hence lose even its apparent force. But in addition to this sort of thing, there are also importance considerations: nearly every causal judgment involves the separation of factors into instigational, instrumental and incidental, as well, perhaps, as into other role categories and gradations. For example, in a trainwreck, the instigational factor might be a bent rail, whereas, the fact that train wheels follow rails, which is causally relevant, is merely incidental here. This is to say it does not explanatorily isolate this case from ones in which wrecks (like this one) do not occur. In the above explosions, one might be tempted to say, e.g. that pressure was the "immediate cause" in every case; after all, it is the push of the pressure which makes an explosion. But frequently this "immediate cause" is merely incidental and not at all explanatory. It is very often fatuous in such cases to invoke the pressure as the cause of the explosion ("Yes of course the pressure must have gone up. What I want to know is what caused the thing"); and this is so precisely because it does not tell us anything we did not already know, i.e. it does not explain anything. It is even more relevant to notice here that the successful elaboration of the kinetic theory of matter in no way discomfits more pedestrian accounts of the above sorts of phenomena (in terms of macrothermodynamic concepts and parapher- nalia) in the contexts where they were previously appropriate. In some contexts, "Why the explosion ?" is adequately answered by, "Some jackass left the burner on too high," and injecting esoteric microphysics would be an impertinent bore. True, in this same context, answering the further question concerning why leaving burners too high causes explosions could well appeal to kinetic theory. But this, of course, is a further question. The original question was adequately answered; and there was nothing about the reply-the explanation-which required this further question: the cause was determined. 354 LARRY WRIGHT</page><page sequence="11">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III Similarly, in many normal contexts, questions concerning the behavior of S are appropriately answered in terms of (T), even though S is a mechanism. S's behavior is teleological in spite of the fact that it is being produced by a mechanism. "Why did S do that? (Why did the missile change course ?)" is appropriately answered by "Because that will tend to bring about G (Because that will help it intercept the target-drone)," even though we know there is an underlying mechanistic account. In this case, just as above, the underlying account is relevant to a further question concerning why S behaves according to this principle. But the possibility of a further question does not show that S fails to behave according to this principle. It explains, from one perspective, why it does. And the argument that the underlying mechanistic account, as soon as it is found, simply supersedes the teleological characterization in every important context, just will not wash. For if, in response to the above question, I were to produce an elaborate mathematical story with a lot of electronic detail, my inter- rogator, if he understood me, might sarcastically reply, "You mean the missile tends to fly at the target-is that what you were trying to say ?" In some contexts, the part of the story which goes beyond the simple teleological reply is irrelevant, obfuscatory and, hence, anti-explanatory. The same kind of point can be made in other contexts: it could easily be the case, e.g. that a naval gunnery officer has to think of his homing missiles teleologically in order to predict and control their behavior. It is possible that understanding them in any other way inhibits him. It is certainly the case that operators of more mundane machinery are often better able to control it if they ignore much of the underlying mechanical detail. Racing drivers would probably be distracted to incapacity if they thought of what they were doing (while they were doing it) in terms of four-bar-linkages, rubber shear limits and transient axial torques. So I take it that there is nothing in this very general argument against the possibility of a mechanism underlying purposive behavior. 4. Animals and the Naturalness of Tendencies. Interestingly, Charles Taylor originally developed his precursor of (T) as an antimechanistic analysis, and this in spite of the fact that he was well aware of the points and possibilities traced in the preceding paragraphs-and even sympathetic to most. To preserve the antimechanistic position in the face of these considerations, he invoked a subtle and attractive distinction which still has some currency.6 Taylor argues that indeed, it is obvious that (T) (or, rather, his version of it) applies to some behavior, e.g. that of feedback devices, which has an underlying nonteleological account; but although this behavior is legitimately goal-directed, it is so only in a narrow, technical sense. On the other hand, genuinely purposive behavior, that exhibited by man and the higher animals, is not so crudely caused by the circumstances: it is rather elicited by them. Accordingly, genuinely purposive behavior must result from inherent natural tendencies, which is to say, ones with no further, underlying explanation. 6 This argument is offered in [7], pp. 20-24. He has recently softened on this position (see, e.g. [6], 54-89, and his contribution to [8]), but since it represents the best formulation of a rather tempting argument, it is worth pursuing in this form. 355</page><page sequence="12">LARRY WRIGHT On this view the caused-versus-elicited distinction devolves to the question of reducibility. Hence the whole sweep of our usual appreciation and explanation of animate behavior would have to be scrapped if it turns out that organisms are neurophysiological mechanisms. And since we have such an enormous panoply of support for the propriety of the ordinary, purposive sort of account, the plausibility, from this perspective, of supposing organisms to be intrinsic mechanisms of any sort is reduced to the vanishing point. Perhaps Taylor's best statement of his position on this issue is one of his earliest. ... the claim that 'the purposes' of a system are of such and such kind affects the laws which hold at the most basic level. In other words, it [i.e. this claim, L.W.] is incompatible with the view that the natural tendency towards a certain condition can itself be accounted for by other laws. Thus the function of an explanation invoking powers or natural tendencies can be precisely to shut off further enquiry. ... Thus we would construct a mechanical dog, programmed to behave like a real one. In this case the laws descriptive of his external behavior [y = f(z)] would be teleological like those of his real counterpart, they would characterize the behaviour as 'goal-directed', but the more basic explanation [y = f2(x)] would not. With systems of this kind we can hardly speak of an account in terms of 'natural' or 'inherent' tendencies. ([7], pp. 20-21) This statement is a particularly good one partly because it quite pointedly relates this argument to the position I have been defending above, and also partly because it brings us back to the notion of natural tendencies with which we began. There is something quite compelling about the view that natural tendencies lie at the heart of teleology. But I also think that a misunderstanding of them lies at the heart of this view of mechanism. The statement of a natural or normal tendency, according to this view, ... plays something of the kind of role in a teleological science of behavior that Inertia does, for instance, in Newtonian physics. In both cases the prin- ciples serve to make clear the kinds of event for which an antecedent must be adduced and the kinds of event for which this is not the case. For Newton's first Law, the continuation of a body at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion did not admit of explanation in this sense, only changes in velocity were to be accounted for. Continued rest or rectilinear motion could be spoken of in this sense as 'natural'. ([7], p. 23; italics added) So, similarly, teleological natural tendencies-purposes-do not admit of any further explanation, and a fortiori, not one in terms of a mechanism. From this it follows that any goal-directed behavior which is produced by a mechanism is not the exhibition of a natural tendency toward a goal at all. So animate behavior, behavior characterized and accounted for in terms of purpose, cannot be the product of an underlying, intrinsic mechanism. The trouble with this argument is, of course, that incredible analysis of natural- 356</page><page sequence="13">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III ness. The crucial observation here is that there are other examples of normalcy or naturalness which do not involve us in any very strong commitment to irreducibility, and these other examples are much closer relatives of the teleological one than Newton's is. Newton's first law "did not admit of explanation" only within theoretical dynamics. Since the first law was a presupposition of the theory which seemed to make the most sense of dynamic phenomena, questioning it within the study of dynamics just could not, at that stage, be made sense of. But it is difficult to understand the notion of "not admitting of explanation" outside of theoretical systematizations and their presuppositions. And the purposive explanations of animate behavior are not normally part of any systematic theory. On the other hand, in the more usual, more pedestrian, and much more analogous cases, natural tendency claims are not at all affected by underlying explainability. In the evolution of organisms, for example, there is a natural tendency for those structural features to survive which help the organism make its way against the elements. The fact that this tendency can be accounted for in terms of the nature of organic reproduction, inheritance of characteristics, and mutation, does not make it the least bit less natural. Similarly for rocks which have a natural tendency to get hot when left sitting in the sun. This tendency would not be more natural if it did not have an underlying microphysical explanation. The irreducibility of purposive behavior and explanations just cannot be supported in this way. There is nothing in the explanatory role of natural tendencies which supports the antimechanist thesis. The drive to make animate natural tendencies irreducible to intrinsic-mechanistic regularities, at least in Taylor's case, resulted from a misperception of the distinc- tion between 'accidental' and 'essential'. We understandably want to say that the goal-directedness of animal behavior is "part of their essential nature" and does not "just come about by accident." And this is interpreted to mean that ... the order or pattern which is visible in animate behavior is radically different from that visible elsewhere in nature in that it is in some sense self- imposed; that the order is itself in some way a factor in its own production. This seems to be the force of the rejection of 'blind accident': the prevalence of order cannot be accounted for on principles which are only contingently or 'accidentally' connected with it, by laws whose operation only contingently results in it, but must be accounted for in terms of the order itself. ... the events productive of order in animate beings are to be explained not in terms of other unconnected antecedent conditions, but in terms of the very order which they produce. These events are held to occur because of what results from them, or, to put it in a more traditional way, they occur 'for the sake of' the state of affairs which follows. And this of course is part of what is meant by the term 'purpose' when it is invoked in explanation. ([7], p. 5) The most interesting thing about this argument is that the feature of animate behavior Taylor wishes to hold out for here can be accommodated by (T) quite consistently with the mechanistic elaboration of it I have suggested above. One of the advantages of (T) over Taylor's formulation is that it explicitly shows teleo- logical etiologies to be just those in which the consequences of the behavior to be 357</page><page sequence="14">LARRY WRIGHT accounted for play a role in bringing the behavior about. This is precisely what Taylor is driving at in the above passage when he speaks of the order being self- imposed. According to (T) it is "a factor in its own production," and we have already seen that this causal relationship is quite independent of there being an underlying mechanism. As far as the accidental/essential issue is concerned, it really does not matter whether an organism's goal-directedness is at bottom irreducible or, alternatively, due to some other aspects of its makeup: either way it is a consequence of the organism's essential nature. It is his physiology. Furthermore, the only worry one could raise by invoking the accidental status of a property like the goal-directedness of behavior is an uncertainty about whether one could count on its persistence. And clearly this does not depend on irreducibility: intrinsic-mechanistic regularities are, after all, regularities. It is possible that talking of 'reducibility' here is what misleads the anti- mechanists. Perhaps the terminology is inappropriately contentious. For it is difficult to speak univocally of the more fundamental account of the behavior of evolved organisms and designed feedback mechanisms. There is a perfectly good sense in which (in both cases) the teleological account is the most fundamental account-the underlying account-in spite of the fact that a mechanistic account is (or might be) also possible. In the case of consciously designed mechanisms, the teleological characterization of their behavior, something of the form (T), will be the design criterion. The explanation for there being any machine there at all, as well as much of its detail, is in terms of (T). The mechanism is explanatorily incidental. What we wanted was something (it did not matter much what) which would behave in a way that would tend to produce G, at least in certain circumstances. That the mechanism turned out to have certain mechanical details is interesting and explanatory only in certain narrowly circumscribed contexts: e.g. where we are incredulous at its possibility, or where mechanical defects affect its performance. And even the notion of a defect makes sense only with respect to (T). Exactly the same case can be made for organisms, but with natural selection replacing design. If it turns out that organisms are neurophysiological mechanisms which (sometimes) exhibit goal-directed behavior, and if their tendency to this particular behavior survived because of some selective advantage it provided, we can demote the details of the neurophysiological mechanism to the status of "explanatorily incidental" in many contexts; just as with the consciously designed mechanisms above. For, once again, given the big (in this case, phylogenetic) picture, they behave like that precisely because that behavior satisfies (T). The goals, of course, being those that will help them stay alive and propagate. Using the term 'reducibility' the way I have in this discussion may suggest that the intrinsic-mechanistic account is necessarily and unequivocally more explana- torily basic than the teleological account. And perhaps it was only this that anti- mechanists mean to deny when they invoke irreducible natural tendencies. This interpretation serves to make the explanatory basicness argument the central one, and for the run of normal mechanisms and organisms the same conclusion follows. For interpreted in this way, even if they are right, only nondesigned machines and 358</page><page sequence="15">MECHANISMS AND PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR III nonevolved organisms would be disqualified. And this also would break the link between animate behavior and the antimechanist thesis. There is, finally, one rather more dramatic difficulty with Taylor's imaginative argument for the necessary irreducibility of purposive dispositions. If we accept either (T) or Taylor's formulation of it, or even Taylor's more idiomatic charac- terizations of teleology, it follows that the behavior of electrons in what is called 'Pauli interactions' is unquestionably teleological. Pauli's exclusion principle (the law governing this behavior) states that the electrons associated with any atom must array themselves among the permissible, discrete energy states such that no more than one electron occupies any energy state.7 This establishes a final condition or result controlling the behavior of electrons in certain sorts of interaction. So the behavior of electrons is in these cases explained by appeal to the fact that it brings about that result. According to (T), or any of Taylor's formulations, this is just what it means to say behavior is teleological, goal-directed. Other bits of teleo- logical terminology fit just as well: the electron did such-and-such in order to avoid occupying the same energy state as another electron. Thus, Eric Rogers explains the repulsion of colliding atoms, and the distortion of their respective electron "shells": A modern physicist would point to Pauli's exclusion principle; in a collision the electrons of one atom have to steer clear of the electrons of the other, leaving the nuclei to repel. ([4], p. 732 fn.) Presumably, the electrons have to do this in order that no two of them occupy the same energy state. Now, I do not take this much to be very exciting. Goal-directedness, as represented by (T), is a scientifically respectable notion, with a straightforward empirical demonstration. So discovering the teleological phenomenon in physics should not be any cause for alarm. With a little imagination other similar examples could no doubt be cooked up using conservation principles or the impossibility form of thermodynamic laws. These, however, would be less interesting simply because the prima facie teleological behavior would be so palpably the result of a conspiracy of intrinsic factors. In the case of a Pauli interaction, all we can say about one aspect of electron behavior is that a certain result demands it. For all we know, Pauli's exclusion principle may be a bedrock law of nature. It is clearly not impossible that it be so. The bare possibility of this, it seems to me, is enough to disqualify the irreducibility of teleological behavior from the demarcating function Taylor wishes it to serve in this argument. 7 It is often put in more straightforwardly quantum mechanical terms. Robert Kingsbury, puts it thus: ". .. no two electrons in any atom may be represented by identical sets of quantum numbers" ([2], p. 528). Gordon Stipe offers a variation: "... no two electrons in the same atom may have the same wave function" ([5], p. 401). REFERENCES [1] Gasking, D. "Causation and Recipes." Mind (1955): 479-487.
