<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humans and Aliens : A Unique Relationship ROBERT G. PIELKE The existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is more or less taken for granted today and is a conviction with considerable scientific support.1 Although few people are aware of the enormous obstacles that would be involved in establishing mutual contact with such beings,2 most are nevertheless convinced that it is only a matter of time before it finally happens. No one seems to suspect, however, that if it were to happen, it would involve us in a relationship different in kind from all others. Without this awareness, the true alienness of this possible encounter is lost. Science fiction allows us to gain a significant insight into what it is that would make this a unique relationship, for nowhere else is this issue so directly confronted and so thoroughly examined. But not all science fiction is equally helpful, even when the theme is ostensibly "first contact." So the first task must be to distinguish the truly relevant pieces of writing from those only superficially relevant. This is what I intend to do in the first part of this essay. The second part will then concentrate on why this would neces sarily be a non-trivial unique relationship, one which is fundamentally dif ferent from all of the possible relationships in which we can find ourselves on this planet. Loren Eiseley, in The Immense Journey (his enormously popular book of meditations on evolution and anthropology), makes the following instructive comment : Mosaic XIII/3-4 0027-1276/80/010029-12J01.50 0 Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">30 Robert G. Pielke In the modern literature on space travel I have read about cabbage men and bird men; I have investigated the loves of the lizard men and the tree men, but in each case I have labored under no illusion. I have been reading about a man, Homo sapiens, that common earthling, clapped into an ill-fitting coat of feathers and retain ing all his basic human attributes including an eye for the pretty girl who has just emerged from the space ship. His lechery and miscegenating proclivities have an oddly human ring, and if this is all we are going to find on other planets, I for one, am going to be content to stay at home.3 Eiseley's major reason for casting aspersions on this tendency among science fiction writers stems from something more than his negative appraisal of our morality. Rather, it has to do with the extent to which the picture presented is completely inaccurate. One of the least publicized aspects of the Darwinian revolution, he says, is the fact that "every creature alive is the product of a unique history. The statistical probability of its precise reduplication on another planet is so small as to be meaningless" (p. 160). Hence, as Eiseley observes, "the truth is that man is a solitary and peculiar development" (p. 158). The same, of course, must be said for all species everywhere in the universe. The evolutionary history of every species is unique, and it is related to a given planetary environment. This latter fact makes species that evolve within the same environment related to each other in ways that extra planetary species cannot be. A planetary environment, in other words, creates a family setting from which others are necessarily excluded. Frequently, the primary intention behind stories which have human-alien contact as their theme is to make some comment about our social, political or moral condition. They are not intended to deal with the human-alien relationship per se. The little collection entitled First Contact, edited by Damon Knight, is a case in point.4 Murray Leinster's story of the same name is the opening tale and is essentially a commentary on our lack of trust. "Doomsday Deferred," also done by Leinster (under his real name, Will Jenkins) superficially comes much closer to dealing with the relationship per se, although the "aliens" are not extraterrestrials but soldier ants. Beneath the surface, however, lurks a Cold War analogy so thinly disguised that it must have dominated his subconscious if it was not deliberately planned. Theodore Sturgeon uses the device of observing humanity through the eyes of an alien in "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast," and he find us slightly ridieulaus. "Not Final!" is Asimov's commentary on human pride and complacency, while one of the most effective destructions of such pre tentiousness is Heinlein's "Goldfish Bowl." Human ignorance is Charles Henneberg's theme in "The Blind Pilot." Kornbluth, in "The Silly Season," specifically tells us that he is only updating the moral of "the boy who cried wolf." Another explicit updating of a bit of folk wisdom is H. B. Fyfe's "In Value Deceived," in which it is reaffirmed that what one person finds value less another might find priceless. Fredrick Brown's "The Waveries" cele brates human ingenuity and the simple life, while critiquing our over</page><page sequence="3">Relationship: Humans and Aliens 31 dependence on technology. If it were not for his emphasis on this theme coupled with his non emphasis on the human-alien relationship, "The Waveries" might actually be able to satisfy Eiseley's implicit criticism. (They are not portrayed as disguised humans. ) The volume closes with an H. G. Wells tale of finding an unknown civilization in the deepest sections of the ocean, thus praising the human quest for the unknown. The important thing in all of these stories is that, despite the fact that the aliens are always portrayed as being physically different from homo sapiens, they almost always think and act as we do. We might disagree with Eiseley's moral assessment of humanity, but his characterization of the typical alien in science fiction is right on the mark. By this I do not mean to suggest that such portrayals are necessarily inferior as works of art. On the contrary, artistic excellence has nothing to do with being accurate in this sense. Some of the very best works of science fiction have made use of humanized aliens: Clarke's Childhood's End, Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness, Tevis' The Man Who Fell To Earth, Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, and Wells's War of the Worlds to name just a few more. Cinematic science fiction has also tended to humanize its extraterrestrials, regardless of their external appearance. Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still is obviously a human in every respect; but even the "Thing" from The Thing, and the "It" from It Came From Outer Space, and the "Alien" from Alien exemplify recognizable human traits. Just as obvious is the fact that the creatures "closely encountered" so recently are little more than technologically superior humans. It matters little in all of these accounts that humans are perceived by aliens as objects of curiosity, as threats to universal peace, as occupants of a desired planet, or as sources of food; the important thing is that these are all human characteristics as well. Their revulsion at us for our differences from them and their struggle to survive and return home are even clearer expressions of human characteristics. Regardless of how the aliens are presented, for the most part they are still humans "clapped into an ill-fitting coat of feathers." It must be granted, of course, that we can express the unfamiliar only in terms of the familiar, the unknown in terms of the known.5 This is the classic dilemma, for example, which confronts anyone who claims that speech about God is meaningful. Except for Platonists, perhaps, it is also the dilemma of anyone attempting to explain how "new" knowledge is acquired. (Kuhn and Bronowski, for example, see it as a break with the past and not as cumulative. But this till does not explain its newness.) In a larger sense it is an enigma for every intelligent but non-omniscient being. This being the case, it hardly seems fair to castigate science-fiction writers for not doing the impossible. There are some writers, however, who have been able to suggest the truly alien character of this potential relationship. And I would like to look at three relevant examples: Herman Tennessen's "Homo Telluris: The Con scious Cosmic Caddis Fly,"6 Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Lem's Solaris.</page><page sequence="4">32 Robert G. Pielke Tennessen describes the thoughts and feelings of a nineteenth-century human being who is transported to the planet Zetetica by an expeditionary force seeking out a new planet for their fellow Zeteticans. The similarity between human and alien in this case is considerable, except for one significant characteristic: the Zeteticans are immortal. Although they can communicate on what turns out to be a superficial level, their immortality (or human ephemerality) makes mutual understanding totally impossible. All of our ideas and concepts, it seems, are thoroughly permeated by the awareness that we will eventually die. To use an analogy from economics, it is as though Zeteticans faced no scarcity of resources of any kind. Imagine how this would affect a debate about economics; our concepts (and theirs) would be mutually unintelligible. Clarke's 2001 presents a different situation, in that mutual contact occurs in three stages. First, the aliens set up an obelisk on earth during man's early evolutionary period. Its purpose is obviously completely unknown to the early humanoid creatures who find it. The second stage happens in the present when a similar object is found buried on the moon. Though it points toward Jupiter, and leads to an encounter which is the third stage, its purpose still remains totally unknown. Millions of years of evolutionary development and the acquisition of massive amounts of knowledge have not advanced humans one inch toward understanding the alien. The only new information is that the alien's existence is established beyond a doubt. As if further to enhance this apparently unbridgeable gulf, Clarke (and Kubrick in the film) refuse even to picture the aliens. Their existence is known, but nothing is ever known about them and whatever intentions they may or may not have (as the ending pointedly suggests). In Solaris, Stanislaw Lern depicts a frustrating relationship with an intelligent "ocean." The earthlings never learn the meaning or purpose of any of its activities, and this impenetrable ignorance plays havoc with the human psyche. Conversely, the ocean is seemingly not able to comprehend any of the humans' activities either. Anthropomorphism (or zoo-morphism) is frequently mentioned in the novel as a permanent limitation to the human capacity to comprehend. But it works both ways: Solarismorphism is seem ingly a permanent barrier to Solaris' ability to comprehend also. On the basis of numerous unintelligible experiences, one of Lem's characters concludes, "that there neither was, nor could be, any question of 'contact' between mankind and any nonhuman civilization." Another character remarks that given this impossibility of real contact and understanding, "we are in a situation that is beyond morality."7 Tennessen, Clarke and Lern are among the few science-fiction writers who take seriously Eiseley's observation that every species is the product of a unique evolutionary history. Obviously, the greatest differences will be between species who do not even share the same planetary environment. In the case of human beings and gorillas, for example, each has a unique evolutionary history as a species, but there is also a point where their</page><page sequence="5">Relationship: Humans and Aliens 33 histories converge. Such is the case for all life forms on earth; all of their histories can be traced back to a common, supporting environmental foundation (even if life originated independently at various times and places). Life forms which have had their origins in different supporting planetary environments will be different from humans in ways which gorillas are nor different, i.e., they will be uniquely different. We share a common evolutionary past with every other earthly species, but this can in no way be the case with an extraterrestrial species—by definition. It is possible, of course, that there are planetary environments very similar to our own, which have in addition given rise to life forms, and further, whose evolutionary histories are also similar to our own. (There are three independent variables here.) But, as Eiseley points out, the chances of this having happened are astronomically small, and his accusation is that science-fiction writers have reversed the true probabilities. In no case, however, can aliens ever be more than very similar to humans, and this is highly unlikely. Thus if and when humans and aliens actually come into contact, the relationship is likely to be something akin to those pictured in the accounts of Tennessen, Clarke and Lem. From my perspective, the most significant common feature in their portrayals is the total inability of human and alien to communicate meaningfully because of their enormous differences. It goes much further than being a problem of language, although (despite Tennessen) this would seem to be entailed. Samuel Delany explores the problems of translation in Babel-17 and the allegedly universal language of science in The Einstein Intersection. In both cases, he seems to find the prospects for communication pretty dim. Semanticists in philosophy, of varying colors and stripes, have also debated these issues with no agreement. While I find myself generally on the side of Wittgenstein and Chomsky (whose positions seem to imply the impossibility of humans and aliens communicating through any kind of language),81 want to explore another ramification of the likelihood of there being enormous differences between the two: Lem's notion that this could be a situation beyond morality. For therein lies the primary clue for understanding the uniqueness of this potential relationship. The key question at this point is why a unique evolutionary history should imply a unique relationship. After all, it seems quite possible to image having relationships with aliens very similar to those that exist among humans, once we were to get to know each other. Relationships among differing human cultures would seem to be an apt analogy ; difficult perhaps, but possible. Moreover, a statement of uniqueness in terms of biological fact cannot alone lead to a statement of uniqueness in terms of relationships. (Relationships necessarily include a moral dimension whenever it is possible for one to be aware of causing, or allowing, injury to occur to another;</page><page sequence="6">34 Robert G. Pielke and facts cannot imply morals. I am assuming in this that harm or injury is a necessary component of an action's being wrong, if not its very meaning.) In response, I want to say, first, that the connection would not be one of deriving moral precepts from facts, as the latter allegation might have it. The assertions concerning the uniqueness of evolutionary histories and that of relationships are both factual claims. It might very well be the case (and I think it is) that different relationships ought to have different moral arrangements (unless the differences are deemed morally unimportant). But this is not my claim at this point. I am simply asserting that there is a necessary connection between thet fact of evolutionary uniqueness and the fact that human-alien contact would involve us both in a unique relationship. I admit that this is not at all obvious, so I will now attempt to show why the connection is logically necessary (hence empirically necessary as well). The real problem, it seems, is to show how the encounter with aliens would differ in essence from the encounters between differing human cultures. Why, in other words, evolutionary uniqueness would make so much of a difference after we got to know each other. My initial response to this is that we might not ever be able to get to know each other. There is more than a difference of degree involved here, despite the fact that we nevertheless might get to know each other. Further, this possible ignorance could very well extend to a mutual inability to know what, if anything, would cause or allow harm to occur. If mutual ignorance were to be so extensive that a knowledge of harm were not possible for either human or alien, it would then be precisely the situation beyond morality that Lern describes. The fact that each would recognize the other's existence would involve them in a relationship, but it would be completely non-moral. (Harm might be possible but not knowing harm, i.e., no wrong could be done.) The very possibility of this happening is what would make this relationship unique. In none of our other relationships is this at all the case; in every other one, without exception, humans can be aware or become aware of causing or allowing harm to occur. We may choose to incur or permit such harm anyway; but, because we can know it, there is always the moral necessity to show why such acts are right. Our decisions may be wrong of course, thus making us subject to blame, if not punishment as well (unless otherwise excused, exonerated or exculpated). But in no case can we plead ignorance in principle, that which would be a possibility with aliens. And this possibility is precisely the unique quality. Our potential relationship with aliens would thus be different in kind, even //humans and aliens were mutually aware of each other's existence. For there would always be the prima facie injunction to establish whether or not a knowledge of and/or capability to cause or allow harm was possible, and if so, to what degree. Whether or not the relationship were a moral one would depend on the presence or absence of this ignorance, unlike in all of our other relationships (where ignorance in principle is not possible logically or empirically). Assuming, again, that knowing harm is a necessary</page><page sequence="7">Relationship: Humans and Aliens 35 constituent of wrong, no wrong could be done if either the knowledge of injury or injury itself were not possible. Morality, in other words, would not automatically (in principle) encompass an alien with whom we might come into contact. We ought, of course, to make every attempt to discover whether a moral relationship would be appropriate, but we should not assume it to be the case as we can and ought to in all of our other relation ships. It is a live issue whether or not any given alien could be included in the moral community, and this makes our potential relationship with such a being unique and momentous. (It may seem difficult to conceive of a situa tion in which there is mutual recognition yet no possibility of knowing harm. This, I think, is why science fiction is so valuable in philosophical thought.) Even if this is granted in the case of our potential relationship with aliens, it might still be argued that this degree of ignorance is already characteristic of many of our other relationships (i.e., with most animals and especially with plants). Further, it might be questioned why harm or injury should have such an overriding moral quality, such that there is a prima facie moral injunction not to cause or permit it to occur. My response to the latter question will also provide a response to the first, in that if it is prima facie wrong knowingly to cause or allow harm to occur, then surely we cannot possibly be ignorant of the harm we can do or allow to happen regarding all other animals and plant life. This response, of course, merely gives rise to another concern, namely, the fact that this ethic would be impossibly rigorous. If valid, it would seemingly leave us no other option than starvation, since even the strictest vegetarianism (which avoids harming most animals) would permit and even encourage injury to plant life. But this objection naively assumes all injuries to be of the same magnitude, importance and value, when this is clearly not the case. Being pinched, bludgeoned and killed are three different degrees of harm; while killing a human, a dolphin, a cow, a worm and an amoeba would seem to be injuries which differ in importance (i.e., deserving of notice). Further, harming a human, a chimp, a redwood tree and a weed would seem to be different in terms of value (i.e., deserving of justification). If these differences, or ones like them, make sense, then it is possible to decide in cases of conflict what ought to be done, i.e., when doing an injury is right, wrong, excusable, etc. I do not propose to develop a scale of this kind, but surely the capacity to suffer would figure prominently in it. At this point I want only to indicate that such a scale is possible. To synthesize food from non-organic sources would be another impossibly rigorous ethic. Not only would it make the same erroneous assumption, however; it would also seem to be unhealthy, i.e., harmful! The real problem is to put all of this into some kind of conceptual scheme, which makes sense of the moral prohibition on harm in the first place. Many people merely assume that the injunction not to cause or allow harm extends only to humans. A very sharp distinction is thus made between human value and the value of all other beings. Hence, it would be a mistake</page><page sequence="8">36 Robert G. Pielke to claim that other animals, to say nothing of plants, have any kind of rights. The alleged harm done to them is really no more than the harm done to those humans who appreciate them. It is not denied that these other beings can be injured; rather, the value of their injury is counted as nothing. Aside from those who have no sympathy at all for this position, there are an increasingly large number of serious thinkers who take the opposite stand.9 The point of many of their arguments is that we have certain duties toward non-human life. While this does not necessarily imply that such life-forms have rights, it does show that they cannot be willfully harmed without any justification. A more sophisticated version of this initial position is to consider morality (and the injunction not to cause or allow harm) relevant only to intelligent life. This would admit intelligent aliens but exclude most other animals as well as all plant life (depending, of course, on how intelligence is under stood). Rarely, however, is any attempt made to show why harming intelli gent creatures would be relevantly different from harming non-intelligent creatures. One person who does make such an attempt is Michael Tooley, and he does so specifically to show how aliens might be included within a moral context. Although he does not relate the right not to be harmed to intelligence perse, but rather to persons, his concept of personhood supplies a supposed relevant difference between harming intelligent and non-intel ligent life. Persons, he argues, are beings with certain psychological properties, namely, self-consciousness and a desire for continuation into the future.10 While non-human animals (and all plants) would not qualify as persons (and thus as possessors of the right), he claims that there are certain conditions under which aliens could qualify (from various philosophical perspectives). These psychological properties are not characteristic of plants and other animals in his current thinking, nor (by extension) are they charac teristic of young children, comatose people, and many who are mentally deficient.11 Logically, then, it would not be wrong to harm them (although there might be other persuasive reasons why we might not wish to do so). In effect, his argument is that these various beings are not capable of being harmed, for harm is implicitly understood to mean the frustration of personal aims (something these beings cannot have or can have no longer). If Tooley's argument or one like it is convincing, my argument that human-alien contact would bring about a unique relationship is mistaken. For then the first task in any relationship would be to establish the pos sibility of personhood (i.e., a being capable of being harmed). Aliens would not be automatically considered any different from terrestrial beings. In actual fact, however, his criterion is not as neutral as it might seem. Whether or not any being qualifies as a person is a decision which only humans could make, and the beings would have to be sufficiently similar to humans so as to make their psychological states recognizable. Thus "aliens" would have to be virtually "human" in order truly to qualify as "persons." This is questionable in two senses: first, it makes the label of person (and possessor</page><page sequence="9">Relationship: Humans and Aliens 37 of rights) contingent solely on a human decision without providing any reason for humans alone having this authority; second, it ignores the geo centric predicament in which we tend to understand everything in earthly terms, making it not too likely that a radically different alien would get a fair hearing. In Tooley's terms, it would not be wrong to harm Solaris, for example (if it were possible). Of course, the fact that Tooley's ethic turns out to be homocentric on closer inspection does little directly to support my contention in this paper. The critique does, however, point out the importance and necessity for a clear definition of harm and the difficulty (if not impossibility) of overcom ing the geocentric predicament. It also illustrates that aliens (as well as others) might not qualify as members of the moral community, depending on how harm is understood. I want to suggest that, given a different notion of harm which does not violate our geocentric predicament (as I think Tooley's does) and given the moral injunction not to cause or allow harm, only aliens might not be capable of inclusion in the moral community. Therein lies the uniqueness of any encounter we might have with aliens. Tooley, as well as many others, merely assumes that harm or injury is equivalent to the experience of physical or psychological pain, requiring at the very least a sentient being in order for harm to occur. Since only sentient beings can thereby be wronged, so this argument goes, only they are eligible for membership in the moral community. I agree that the possibility of being harmed is the key to admission, but we should question why harm should be restricted to a certain kind of experience. Is not a redwood tree injured when it is chopped down? We may value its preservation more than we do a weed uprooted from a garden, but the comparative value of the injured victim is not at issue. What is at issue is the meaning of injury (or harm) itself. Why, in other words, should some form of pain be necessary in order for something to be termed an injury? I see nothing in material on the subject to convince me that this ought to be the case, and much to suggest that the definition is arbitrary. A much more acceptable procedure, it seems to me, is to understand harm in the broadest possible way. Thus it makes sense to speak of injury to living things, while non-living things might be damaged, defaced or des troyed (but not harmed). The harm that can come to all living things perse can only be something that thwarts their survival, i.e., the active or passive inhibition of their needs from being fulfilled (possibly causing their deaths). Inanimate objects do not struggle to survive; so they have no needs and they cannot die ! Survival, of course, can have a variety of meanings depending on the life form in question, and specific survival-needs will differ accordingly.12 One factor will nevertheless remain constant in this scheme: the fact that all species are mutually dependent on each other in a variety of ways for their survival. Moreover, injuries can be indirect as well as direct, making the interrelationship of needs very complex indeed. All species, for example, survive at the expense of others, making the conflict of needs inevitable.</page><page sequence="10">38 Robert G. Pie Ike Put differently, some beings injure others and some assist others in order to survive. The earth as a whole, in this way of thinking, is considered as one enormous ecosystem. I do not intend to engage in a protracted defense of this relationship between harm understood as the thwarting of survival needs and our obliga tion not knowingly to allow or cause harm to occur, but a defense is cer tainly called for (a necessity many other theorists seem not to acknowledge). Such a defense is crucial, for it would establish the prima facie right of all species to survive. Something like the following brief sketch, however, appears quite persuasive: if we grant to ourselves (human beings) the right to survive by satisfying our many and complex needs, on what basis do we deny it to other species (and their individual members)? The usual reasons cited are our species' higher intelligence and/or greater power. But if this is all it boils down to, then we would have to surrender this right to a species or an alien which turned out to be more intelligent and/or powerful than we are. Further, should only the most intelligent and/or powerful species have this right to exclusion of all other species? If not, then some additional con nection would have to be made between intelligence and/or power as facts, and the moral right to survive, which is not obviously a logical possibility. Arguments to the contrary failing, it seems correct to say that all life forms have a prima facie right to satisfy the needs necessary for their survival, i.e., it would be prima facie wrong to thwart any life form in its quest for survival (i.e., knowingly to cause or allow harm to befall it). If this conception of harm can be granted for the moment, there are some interesting implications which seemingly follow. First, the interrelationship of needs will in all probability be limited to a given planet or evolutionary complex. Extraterrestrials might have needs (although this is not logically necessary), but they will almost inevitably be different from those of any earthly life form. Second, given that this is the case, it may not be possible for either humans or aliens to be aware of thwarting each other's needs. It may not even be possible to do so. If either were to be the case, then clearly such aliens would not qualify as members of our moral community. It is also quite clear that only aliens can possibly be excludable in this sense, although they might not be in fact. Third, this conception of harm fully acknowledges man's geocentric predicament. It grants the difficulty, and perhaps the impossibility, of humans ever understanding aliens on their own terms. Their conception of survival and hence their needs might make absolutely no sense to us, and to understand them in our terms would be clearly illegitimate. Further, they might not even be able to make sense out of the concepts of needs and survival; and we might find ourselves incapable of making sense out of this ! Tennessen's immortal Zeteticans, for example, could not comprehend the concepts of verifica tion, meaning, justice and purpose—because of their peculiar kind of alienness.13 Morality itself might be unintelligible to some aliens, no matter how intelligent they might be.</page><page sequence="11">Relationship: Humans and Aliens 39 Finally, if the potential relationship between humans and aliens could possibly be beyond morality as Lem expresses it, we might well wonder what such a non-moral relationship would be like. I take it that we can compre hend other non-moral relationships (e.g., moss and trees, flowers and bees, chimps and bananas, humans and redwoods, humans and tape worms, and humans and the Pyramids). The problem apparently arises when both parties are self-aware or intelligent. A tentative solution might come from a recognition of what is involved in these other non-moral relationships. In every case, at least one side of the relationship is of extrinsic or inherent value or disvalue to the other. In the radically novel situation which might arise between humans and intelligent aliens, this would be the case as well. We would have to assess their status according to some scale of values. If, for example, the experience of pleasure were of intrinsic value, then aliens in this kind of relationship should be judged according to the pleasure or pain likely to result from the association. If, on the other hand, the satisfaction of curiosity were our highest good, we would then view these radically dissimilar aliens in a very different light. Much would depend on the aliens in question, of course. I assume that the tension between the various pro tagonists in Alien is precisely over the value or disvalue of the invader according to different ultimate goods. In any case, the point I am trying to make is that this unusual non-moral relationship would not necessarily imply a negative one—one characterized by disrespect, fear and disgust. It would be just as likely to be one of wonder, curiosity and beauty. NOTES 1/ Aside from numerous probabilistic calculations represented by the formula N=R fpnefififcL developed by Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, there is some evidence (albeit inferential) for the existence of at least twelve planets outside our solar system but within close proximity to earth in terms of stellar distances. While this in no way establishes the existence of E.T.I., it does increase its likelihood dramatically by strongly implying that planets are a relatively common phenomenon in the universe. 2/ George Abell, for example, makes the point that receiving messages from E.T.I.'s is about the best we can presently hope for. See his "The Search for Life Beyond Earth: A Scientific Update," in Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, ed. James Christian (Buffalo, 1976), pp. 53-71. Due to possibly radical, qualitative differences between ourselves and aliens, we may not even be able to become aware of them, nor they of us. This is an option we have to consider, argues Peter Angeles in "ETIs and the Problem of Intelligence" in Extra-Terrestrial Intelli gence,pp. 161-75. 3/ Loren Eiseley, The Immense Journey (New York, 1946), p. 158. 4/ First Contact, ed. Damon Knight, (Los Angeles, 1971). 5/ Angeles makes this point but does not let it lead him to either Platonism or nonsense. 6/ Since Tennessen is not a science-fiction writer by trade (being rather a philosopher), it is to be expected that his ability to communicate broadly is limited. Yet he has created a delightful tale (included in Christian's anthology) which analyzes the relationship in a provocative way. 7/ See Stanislaw Lern, Solaris (New York, 1961), pp. 125,142,160,178.</page><page sequence="12">40 Robert G. Pielke 8/ The question of communicating with aliens is exceedingly complex, but certain things must be taken into account. Together, Wittgenstein and Chomsky convince me that the probability is pretty low. First, there would be no shared culture on which concepts might be based; even our physical environments would differ dramatically. Second, the assump tion that science is a universal language is based on the belief that it develops without a break along a single predictable track (which it does not), the belief that all cultures would develop along the same path (which they have not), the belief that all species would have the same perceptual equipment (which they would not), and the belief that scientific description is passive and not a positive, interpretive activity (which it is). Third, mathe matics is just as non-cumulative as the sciences and as such in no better position to be universal. Fourth, learning a new language in the manner of a child is probably an unrepeatable process, as argued by Eric Lenneberg in The Biological Foundations of Language (New York, 1967). And placing a human child in an alien environment would be absurd. Fifth, as Wittgenstein points out, understanding a language is to understand a way or form of life. In his Investigations (New York, 1953), he notes that even if lions could talk, we could not understand them. Finally, in Chomsky's Reflections on Language (New York, 1976), the position is advanced that human language is based on a kind of deep structural program in the brain, perhaps even something like an organ—a human organ. 9/ A defense of this position can be found in the following, among others: Peter Singer, Animal Liberation (New York, 1975); Joel Fineberg, "The Rights of Animals and Unborn Generations," in Philosophy and Environmental Crisis, ed. William T. Blackstone (Athens, Georgia, 1974); the entire issue of Ethics, 88, No. 2 (Jan., 1978); and Christopher Stone, Should Trees Have Standing? (New York, 1974).
