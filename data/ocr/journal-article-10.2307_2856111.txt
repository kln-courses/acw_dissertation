Ikonographisch-ikonologische Untersuchung der Herkunft und Entwicklung einer spatmittelalterlichen Bildidee und ihrer Verwurzelung im Wort. Einsiedeln, Zurich, Switzerland; Cologne, Germany: Benziger, 1964. Pp. 225; 30 plates, 19 figures. UPON entering S Petronio in Bologna, two enigmatic frescoes, whose dimensions are commensurate with the huge church, impress the visitor. Painted by Gio- vanni da Modena in 1421 in the plastic idiom of the early Renaissance, they are set under ogee and crocketed arches in a perspective "di sotto in sui." One depicts Christ crucified amidst the boughs of the Tree of Life, the other a crucifixion showing Christ nailed on a "living cross." The four ends of the "living cross" become arms, weirdly painted with red sleeves, respectively engaged in opening Paradise- with a key (top), crowning the Church (proper right), stabbing the synagogue (proper left) and unbolting the gates of Hell (bottom). The author of Das lebende Kreuz has drawn up a catalogue raisonne' of thirty analogous Living Crosses, which elaborates and adds to the list found in W. Molsdorf's Christliche Symbolik der mittelalterlichen Kunst. It does not include, however, the fresco at Gais, near Bruneck (cf. Mitteilungen der KK. Zentral-Kommission XXIV, [N.F.] 1898, p. 183). While many features of the crucifixion of the "living cross" type are of Germanic origin and date from the eleventh and twelfth century, the majority of monuments illustrating this strange iconography date from the fifteenth century and are concentrated in southern Germany and Austria. Apart from a few aberrant and late Franco-Flemish instances, the type of the Living Cross spread only to Italy. A painted panel in the Correr museum, Venice, (XXX of the catalogue), may be the earliest surviving example. I believe that, rather than being Venetian and early fifteenth century, it must be attributed to a Bolognese artist of the late fourteenth century. There also exist some late Russian examples copied after an Italian model (cf. XXVII-XXIX and XX). Two panels, treated in a manner quite different from the rest of the series, one in the Thyssen collection at Castagnola - Lugano (I) and the other in the Art Institute, Chicago, (II) are early fifteenth-century works. The first was painted by a Westphalian master from the circle of Konrad von Soest, while the second is attributed to a Cologne artist. Maybe the latter one should be given to a mas- ter from Guelders. The symmetrical volutes above the cross, symbolizing the Tree of Life, and the antithesis between the Lamb and the sacrifices under the</page><page sequence="2">146 Reviews old dispensation in the first panel suggest to me affinities with the Quinity of the Toruin altar (National Museum, Warsaw), a north-eastern German painting un- der the influence of the Bohemian school. In the early and also in some of the retardataire versions of the Living Cross, the hands are emblematic; they hold a key, a sword (or an arrow) or make the gesture of blessing. But the lower hand is always active, either grasping the hand of Adam, brandishing a hammer, or beating the skull of Adam with a club. In the established type of the iconography the three other hands are in full action; they respectively open the gates of Paradise, crown the Church, stab or slash the Synagogue with a sword, the lower hand breaking the gates of Hell. In a few cases the cross became animated only at its lowest extremity by the addition of the hand of Christ, symbolizing the Harrowing of Hell, or the Rex Gloriae Him- self appears in the cave at the foot of the Cross (XXX, VIII, XI). The Church and the Synagogue, usually facing each other on either side of Christ crucified, are depicted respectively mounted on a monstrous tetramorph, symbolizing the four Evangelists, and riding a goat, or a donkey and then holding the protome of a goat. Other themes are mingled with the central one of the Living Cross: the Virtues in the process of crucifying Christ (VI, XXX); the exorcism of the enemies of Christ by the Cross (II) or the defense of the City of God (XIV); the opposition between the Virgin as new Eve and Life, on the one hand, and Eve, Death and the old Law, on the other; the blood and water gushing out of the body of Christ as sources of the sacraments; the Tree of Life bearing fruit and hosts, and the Tree of Knowledge bare or bearing apples which are changed into skulls. Exceptionally, the skull is held not by Eve but by the Synagogue (cf. XIII). Finally, the catch of Leviathan (XX, XXI, and the derivative Rus- sian examples). Of the collateral themes mingled with the motif of the Living Cross, only the crucifixion by the Virtues was examined in Das lebende Kreuz. Indeed, it demon- strates very convincingly the process whereby the allegorized crucifixion com- mon in twelfth-century art was transformed into a dramatized conceptualization in the thirteenth century; paving the way for the surrealistic imagery of the cross during the period of the international style in Gothic art. Is it indeed coin- cidental if in a manuscript dated after 1254 the two portals of the gate of Para- dise, a motif borrowed from Mosan ivories of the eleventh century, appear with the Church and the Synagogue in a Crucifixion by the Virtues (cf. note 11, in fine, p. 114)? Or, if in a different context, the Church holds a key while gathering the blood dripping from the feet of Christ on an ivory plaque on the cover of a prayer book belonging to St Elizabeth of Thtiringen, now in the museum of the chapter at Cividale? (cf. de Linas, Revue de l'Art Chretien, 1885, p. 213).* Is the Living Cross, as the author asserts, only a "Bildidee," a visual abstrac- tion, or rather a frame of reference used to organize and bring to life images po- tentially implied in symbolical and exegetical texts? Certainly almost all its elements can be detected in the "Written word": the gates of Paradise and Hell, * For the keys and the sword as emblems of the apocalyptic Christ, see the romanesque ivory por- table altar published by A.

Cosmological, moral, and mystical interpretations of the dimensions and parts of the cross were already expounded by the Greek and Latin Fathers on the basis of St Paul (Eph. iii 14-19). This analytical exegesis of the scheme of the cross was enriched by the Talmudic tradition of the three kinds of foliage composing the Tree of Life, out of which was born the legend of the five kinds of wood used for the cross. The Living Cross first became active at both ends of its vertical axis, those corresponding to the Ascension, or opening of the gate of Paradise, and to the Harrowing of Hell at the opposite lower part. Such a dynamic polarity was commented on already before 350, in chapter twenty-four of the De errore profanarum religionum of Firmicus Maternus. When the Living Cross, complete with four hands, was disseminated in late mediaeval art, its concept was explained by Ludolf von Sachsen and Nicolaus Schulmeister in terms of a dramatic quaternity (see the texts, pp. 214-215). It is in the treatise, Vita Christi, by Ludolf von Sachsen, that the author of Das lebende Kreuz came upon a long sought after commentary that he believed might have lead to the anthropomorphic representation of the Living Cross: "signat enim pars superior januae coelestis apertionem, inferni destructionem, a dextris gratiae collationem, a sinistris peccatorum remissionem." But he was frustrated in his search for discovering an actual literary description of the Living Cross. One could question why the hope of ferreting out a perfect parallelism between an image and a text was ever entertained. Like the schemata studied by Harry Bober, the Living Cross exemplifies a visual dialectic design based on the crystallisation of existing forms rather than on a combination of texts. It is a "schema" pregnant with superimposed meanings, a figured monogram consisting of a cosmological axis (the vertical part of the cross) and of a moral axis (the transversal part). Both are rooted in Adam, buried at the foot of the Cross, whose name in Hebrew con- notes the four cardinal points. The hand, which at the top of Carolingian ivory plaques of the crucifixion proffered the "aurum coronarium" above the head of Christ, was changed into a blessing hand turned toward the side symbolizing Vita in the mid-twelfth century walrus ivory cross from Bury St Edmunds in the Cloisters in New York. More significantly, the blessing hand protrudes from the twelfth-century bronze crucifix at Saint-Julien- aux-Bois. There was in Italian art a tradition of the cross rendered alive by an avenging angel on the side of the Synagogue (Deposition from the Cross by B. Antelami in the Cathedral of Parma and, in a Savonarolian context, the Mystical Cruci- fixion by Botticelli in the Fogg Art Museum). On a crucifixion painted on a codex of the early thirteenth century in Wiesbaden, the blood of Christ runs over the head of the Church, who thus fills her chalice. In the stained-glass panel of the Crucifixion in the early Gothic cathedral of Chalons-sur-Marne on the other hand, the Synagogue holds under the cross a scroll inscribed with her self-indict- ment: "Sanguis ejus super nos et super filios nostros" (MATT. xxvii 25). "Mensa</page><page sequence="4">148 Reviews eorum coram ipsis in laqueum" (Ps. lxviii 23). On folio 38 of his sketchbook (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale,) Villard de Honnecourt drew four stone cutters with hammers (asciae), arranged according to the rotating scheme of a swastika, possibly a cryptic chrystological symbol because of its proximity to a drawing of the Trinity allegorized as three fish with one head. Villard de Honnecourt pat- ternized his rotating scheme of stonecutters after models of Frankish jewelry like the tetrasceles of monsters girating as a crux gammata around a cross set immo- bile at their center (cf. E. Salin, La civilisation merovingienne, Paris IV, 1959, fig. 65, cf. pp. 238-240). A connection may also be indicated with the Roman funeral stelae carved with two and four T-squares (the gates of space). Finally, the suggestion arises that the idea of grafting four hands at the extremeties of the Living Cross, three hands acting anti-clockwise and one clockwise, was inspired by the German carvings of the solar signs of the swastika near the cross during the Middle Ages. One of the most remarkable features of the iconography of the Living Cross is the representation of the Church riding the tetramorph. The origin of that motif was not investigated by R. L. Ftiglister. The illustration of an initial L in manuscript clm 15701 in the Staatsbibliothek, Munich (P. Weber, Geistliches Schauspiel ... Stuttgart, 1894, p. 111) shows the Church riding a lion. That image copies Cybele mounted on a lion. In the Anglo-Frankish Romanesque manuscript No. 777 in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, the evangelists Mark, Luke, and John each ride their animal symbols. In illuminations of Salz- burg manuscripts, towards the middle of the twelfth century, the Sunamitis of the Song of Songs is carried in a chariot, the four wheels of which are arranged like the tetramorph of the visions of Ezekiel and St John. The Sunamitis drawn by the very chariot of the Church symbolically anticipates the return of the Synagogue, at the end of time, when it will have been converted by one of three means: by the Gospel channeled through the four Evangelists, by the four mys- teries of the life of Christ on earth, according to analogous interpretations, or by His virtues as they are typified by the four visible and the fifth (invisible) parts of the cross. The tetramorphic steed of the Church on the right of the Living Cross is a quaternity come alive and tied up with the cosmological, moral, and mystical quaternities fused in the quadripartite extension of the cross. Since St Jerome the four Evangelists had been equated with the four elements of the world which the cross sustains as their vinculum substantiale. It will be noted that whereas the bones of the Paschal Lamb could not be broken (Ex. xii 46; Num. ix 12), the legs of the goat mounted by the Synagogue are broken. The Living Cross was invested with the prophetic meaning of a Last Judgment, in which Christ, spouse of the Church, will be judge of His enemies in the guise of the Synagogue. In the Crucifixion of the Hortus Deliciarum, a monument which in many respects anticipates the type of the Living Cross, the "Synagoga excecata" stands on the side of the bad thief, who personified the damned. But when St Bernard addressed reproaches to the Synagogue (sermon on the Song of Songs quoted on p. 187), his words suppose the final reconciliation of the Church and the Synagogue: "caeca et contentiosa desereris donec plenitudo</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 149 gentium introeat." That prophecy is in keeping with the traditional interpreta- tion of the latitudo of the cross as the charity of Christ: "per extensionem manuum duos populos ad unum deum congregans" (Irenaeus, quoted on p. 187). In the allegorical and emblematic crucifixion painted in the Uta codex of Niedermulnster, Regensburg, ca 1070, Mors is struck by a mace-like sprouting of the Liber Vitae. It is highly significant that the illustration of the Uta codex was freely copied about 1410 in a manuscript from Kloster Metten in lower Bavaria (cf. p. 123). The Living Cross appears thus not to have been a spontaneous crea- tion of late mediaeval art based on a literary tradition. Many of its ingredients hark back to themes invented over the long development of Romanesque art in Germany and persisting there until the thirteenth century. They were to be re- captured in late Gothic art owing to certain surrealistic tendencies underlying the international style that helped the revival of abstract symbolic compositions ultimately based on Romanesque patterns.
