Text in German. DM 39.80 softcover. Reviewed by Christraud M. Geary National Museum of African Art Washington, D.C. Among German anthropologists who study African material expressions, Till Forster is one of the most prolific writers. In recent years he has published several books and catalogues, most devoted to his three years of fieldwork among the Senufo. This publi- cation, whose title translates into English as "Shiny Like Gold: Brass Casting among the Senufo, Ivory Coast," accompanied an exhibit he curated on Senufo brass casting. A second, closely related, exhibit also curat- ed by Forster, and shown at the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, presented the art of the Senufo (see Ellen Suthers's review of Die Kunst der Senufo in African Arts, vol. 23, no. 1, 1989, pp. 97-98). The title of the catalogue currently under review is actually somewhat misleading, because this study is much larg- er in scope than its heading indicates. Like the catalogue Die Kunst der Senufo, which contextualizes Senufo art, this book analyzes the use and meaning of brass objects in rela- tionship to Senufo thought and cultural practices. In the first part, titled "The Senufo," the author sets the brass objects into their larger context. He begins with a brief overview of Senufo history and an evaluation of early sources on this people. These are followed by a chapter on everyday life in which Forster discusses the cultural patterns and practices shaping the Senufo experience. The village- wilderness dichotomy recurs consistently in his examination of their agricultural and hunting practices, their world view, and the Poro men's society. Other prominent themes are the role of the matrilineages and of the balancing and cross-cutting institutions such as Poro, which, in the absence of central lead- ership, tie the lineages together. Forster then devotes a lengthy discussion to marriage strategies creating cohesion between lineages and to premarital relationships between young girls and boys, which the lineages closely monitor. Forster's understanding of the Senufo experience is based on his attempts to come to grips with Senufo indige- nous categories of thought. Divination and healing, the topics of the next chapter, are part of and emanate from this everyday life. In fact, divination was the sub- ject of Forster's Ph.D. dissertation. Its connec- tion to the topic of the catalogue initially remains somewhat obscure, until the reader realizes that diviners not only use brass objects but also advise their clients to commission or buy particular types of rings, bracelets, and pendants. Brass objects can thus be interpreted as material expressions of the clients' concerns and needs. Forster's description and analysis of divination are thorough. While many prob- lems that diviners resolve arise from conflicts and occurrences perceived as signs by those who seek help-the author gives a long list of reasons for consultation-it is once more the dialectic of village-wilderness that creates the conceptual and metaphorical framework of divination. The diviners act as brokers between the two realms and draw their pow- ers from the tugubele, beings that reside in the wilderess and may either help or give trouble to humans who enter their sphere. They assist the diviners, acting as ideal mediators between the village and the wilderness. Figurative wooden and brass sculptures among the diviner's paraphernalia represent these tugubele. Other brass objects, such as bracelets and miniature replicas of objects, may be part of the diviner's kit and help the diviner interpret events that had happened to Boyhood Rituals in an African Society An Interpretation Simon Ottenberg This provocative study of boyhood in a group of Igbo villages in southeastern Nigeria traces the life and experiences of boys from birth through adolescent initiation to adulthood. Focusing on a richly detailed description and analysis of adolescent initiation rites, Ottenberg draws on both psychoanalytic and anthropologi- cal theory to advance our understanding of African ritual and social structure. 400 pp., illus., maps, appendixes, bibliog., index Clothbound, $30.00 Order toll-free 1-800-441-4115 U 16 I _ I_ II -I l IlI I ;=^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^tu4m?o _ a =_^^^^^^^^^^^</page><page sequence="2">PAOLO MORIGI GALLERY EXPERT ARTE PRIMITIVA AFRICA- AMERICA OCEANIA CASA CALAO * 6983 MAGLIASO * LUGANO * SWITZERLAND TELEPHONE 091-71.19.62 * BY APPOINTMENT their clients. After Forster identifies the divin- ers' sources of knowledge and power, he gives detailed accounts of divining in the form of transcriptions of actual sessions accompanied by numerous photographs. He concludes that divination achieves the reconstitution of the individual identities of those who seek advice, that it serves social integration, and, because of its flexibility, that it allows the Senufo to adjust to changing situations. Life histories, as they unfold in divinatory sessions, form the core of the next chapter, for brass pendants and bracelets are closely tied to the life histories of their owners. Once the reason for the client's problem has been found, the diviner will ask him or her to wear a particular brass item, such as a python bracelet or a tortoise pendant, which, through its metaphorical and mythical allusions, relates directly to the client's life. By placing these brass objects into their divinatory con- text, Forster makes a strong case for the exploration of their indigenous meaning, which, of course, differs from the Western- biased explanation of these pendants and bracelets as objects of, above all, aesthetic sig- nificance. The chapter ends with a short description of funerary practices in the buri- als of blacksmiths in order to present contex- tual information on another brass object: the kodal mask. The second part of the catalogue, titled "The Technique," is devoted to the technolo- gy and history of the cire perdue process. Once again, Forster casts his net widely. Rather than dealing only with the Senufo, he discusses the use of cire perdue in the Western Sudan and its relationship to the development of trade, in particular the cop- per and gold trade, as well as to political his- tory. The chapter on the history of cire perdue, which came to the Senufo through trade connections, begins with a visit to pre- sent-day markets in Korogho and other larg- er towns. After providing a lengthy description of the traders' goods, accompa- nied by fine photographs, Forster finally comes to the point; namely, that the traders offer a large variety of cire perdue objects covering the entire repertoire needed in div- ination. The only exceptions to this rule are the brass masks, danced during funerals, which cannot be purchased in the markets. Forster then takes a step back in time and, beginning in the Middle Ages, examines the trans-Sahara trade. This part of the catalogue is a compilation of the present state of research on the copper and gold trade, based on the works of Posnansky, Garrard, Person, and many others. The next chapter deals with the cire per- due process. Cire perdue, as practiced by the kpeebele, the brass casters' group, dates from the late sixteenth century. Today, the black- smiths (fonobele) and rope makers (celibele) also engage in brass casting. After a discus- sion of each group and its role in Senufo soci- ety, the main part of the chapter is devoted to a step-by-step description of the casting of a kodal mask produced by blacksmiths. In the tradition of other German writings about 18</page><page sequence="3">L.KRfHN GRLLERY INC 0f ncan arts 560 BRORDUJAYSUITE 508 NYC 1001 2/966-1138 production processes (I am thinking here of Himmelheber's and Fischer's work on carv- ing and Stossel's work on pottery), the mate- rial presented is very detailed and of great interest to anybody who studies technology. It is, to my knowledge, the best and most comprehensive analysis of the Senufo brass casting technique available, and is enhanced by the seventy-five excellent photographs accompanying it. The third and final part, "The Catalogue," consists of a catalogue raisonn6 of brass objects, which Forster collected during a three-month survey among the Senufo, and of pieces in the collection of the Museum fur Volkerkunde in Berlin. He classifies the objects according to formal criteria, distin- guishing between masks, bracelets, leg rings, rings, pendants, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, and musical instruments such as bells. Each category is accompanied by a introduction that often criticizes or cor- rects previous assumptions about those objects. Because brass kodal masks have been frequently misinterpreted in the literature, his findings about them are the most interesting. The entry for each piece is exemplary, giving the use according to local information, the producers (ethnic group, location, and year), the provenance (ethnic group, sub-group, and location), the media, and details of the production technique. Museum curators who must identify objects will find this method of presentation particularly helpful. In summary, the variety of topics makes this a valuable book for Senufo specialists. Forster's work deepens our understanding of Senufo culture, and certainly needs to be read along with Glaze's and Richter's writings on the same people. From a more general per- spective, his analysis of their brass-casting technique will also interest scholars of African technology. Further, his discussion of trans- Sahara trade presents a helpful historical overview, and his interpretation of the Senufo world view and divination according to indigenous conceptualizations is also rele- vant for comparative purposes.

I and colorful descriptions, such as those of the seasonal cycle or the African market, are a pleasure to read, as are many other passages. Excellent black-and-white and color pho- tographs taken in Senufo country and of the objects accompany the text. If I have any reservations, they concern the catalogue's organization: I was often left wandering and wondering, not knowing where the text would go next or why particu- lar parts were strung together in ways that did not immediately betray their purpose in a catalogue on brass casting. Yet in the end all the pieces fitted together, allowing the larger historical, economic, and societal context of Senufo brass casting to emerge. Forster him- self states in the foreword (p. 8): "Ultimately, the theme of this book is not only the discus- sion of the objects, but their meaning for the people who produce them and live with them."

Reviewed by Allen F Roberts The University of Iowa, Iowa City Marc Felix's Maniema was written to accom- pany a gallery exhibition in Munich. His 32- page essay introduces the volume, which presents eighty-three masks (all but one in wood, the other in barkcloth) in black-and- white photographs of high quality. In two or three pages of ethnography, Felix outlines the history, social organization, and "sculptural typology" of each of the Zairian ethnic groups from which these masks come, then describes four stylistic subdivisions of the Maniema region. Twenty-five black-and-white field photos by Felix and Charles Henault are offered as well. Several of these depict art in context or portray interesting people and activities (e.g., a photo of two Kumu maskers in full cos- tume, p. 31), but most are of snapshot quality, showing landscapes that could have been photographed almost anywhere.
