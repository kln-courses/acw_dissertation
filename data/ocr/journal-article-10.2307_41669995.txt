<plain_text><page sequence="1">articles 1 I articles THE PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL ECOLOGIST Social Work Redefined Michael Ungar Abstract: Social work's historical claim as the profession most dedicated to serving the person-in-environment, coupled with its recent advances in critical, feminist, and postmodern theory and practice, has made the title "social worker" an inadequate reflection of the profession's evolving activities. A change of name to the profession of social ecology would reposition social work practitioners on the leading edge of progressive ecological thought, as both consumers and contributors to theory. Three axioms for an ecologically based philosophy for the human services emerge from recent advances in ecological theory: the necessity for a communal, rather than hierarchical and bureaucen- tric, perspective; recognition for the intrinsic value of individuals and their communities; and the importance of mutuality and cooperation. These princi- ples reflect advances in both the theory and practice of social work over the past several decades and growth in ecological thinking away from systems- based models. Combined, they define the foundational knowledge of the pro- fessional social ecologist. Abrégé : Compte tenu de l'assertion historique du service social comme étant la profession la plus vouée qui soit au service à la personne dans son milieu et de ses progrès récents du côté de la théorie et de la pratique critiques, féministes et postmodernes, le titre de « travailleur » social témoigne mal de l'évolution des activités de la profession. En changer le nom à celui d'écolo- gie sociale remettrait les praticiens du service social à l'avant-garde de la pen- sée écologique progressiste, et ce, tant à titre de consommateurs que de cul- tivateurs de la théorie. Il se dégage trois axiomes pour une philosophie écologique des services à la personne du domaine de la théorie écologique : la nécessité d'une perspective communale plutôt que hiérarchique et bureau- centrique; la reconnaissance de la valeur intrinsèque des individus et de leurs communautés; et l'importance de la mutualité et de la coopération.

Combinés, ils définissent le savoir fondamental de l'écologiste social professionnel. S OCIAL WORK needs a new name, one that better reflects advances in the profession's body of knowledge and methods of practice. For over 100 years, social work, more than other human service disciplines, has both tolerated and celebrated a perspective of individuals as embedded in their families, communities, and the broader socio-polit- ical context. More recently, this perspective has fit well with a noticeable convergence among critical, feminist, and postmodern approaches. Given these developments in the profession's theory and practice, the title "social work" has become an anachronism. Recent advances in eco- logical theory are more synchronic with progressive approaches to human services. An emerging new ecology offers social work a less deterministic, more mutual and non-hierarchical model of ecological social work practice than that of systems-based models made popular by Carol Meyer, Carel Germain, and their colleagues two decades ago. Based on these developments, and in recognition of the profession's historical concern for transactional processes of the person-in-environ- ment, it is proposed that social workers come to be known as "profes- sional social ecologists." While attempting to unify the profession under one title is a Herculean task that some might argue unnecessary (Wakefield, 1996b), the fact remains that "social work" no longer reflects what social workers strive to accomplish. A professional focus on person-in-environment While interest in broader contextual forces among allied human serv- ices and health professionals has waxed and waned, social workers have consistently occupied themselves with understanding transactional processes between individuals, their families, communities, and, more recently, physical environments. As Richard Ramsay (1994) explains, "The profession holds that its primary focus of attention is on the transactional patterns between person and environment entities, rather than a dual focus, alternating from one entity to the other... the focus given to the transactions between the individual and society that affect the quality of the whole system is a domain of practice that no other helping profession has claimed" (p. 184). While the discipline has been committed to this ecological perspective, it has lacked a conceptual and scientific anchor upon which to base its practice, leading some to view the numerous approaches to practice mistakenly as divisive rather than theoretically convergent (see, for example, Wakefield, 1996b). Other applied fields like medicine and psychology may have advanced with</page><page sequence="3">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 7 far greater influence, in part because of their conceptual unity based on a defined "ology," a body of scientific knowledge such as biology that underpins the work of the profession. The disciplinary titles of such health-related professions contain a clear indication of their conceptual and practical parameters. Arguably, social work lacks such clearly stated parameters. As Glen Schmidt and his colleagues (Schmidt, Westhues, Lafrance &amp; Knowles, 2001) note in their report on the results from the Canadian National Sector Study (CASW, 2001), social workers are con- cerned that fragmentation, dilution of their roles, and deprofessional- ization threaten their professional identity. In interdisciplinary teams, Schmidt et al. explain, social workers find it increasingly "difficult to describe their role and function clearly" (p. 90). While the suggestion to strengthen professional leadership through more extensive training of social work administrators is noteworthy, "halting the erosion of pro- fessional leadership," to use the authors' phrase, is equally dependent on clarifying and strengthening the theoretical foundation of social work practitioners. Doing so would properly position social work pro- fessionals in a leadership role in the dominant discourse of the helping professions. As the professionals most concerned with transactions between per- sons and environments, social workers are uniquely positioned to apply ecological principles to understanding human processes. However, ear- lier ecosystems and ecological social work models based on systems the- ory have been unable to account for relationships of power or the lev- els of discourse that distinguish professionals from those served. Thus, to date, ecological models of social work have failed to provide a suffi- ciently robust analysis of the politics of intervention to unify the field conceptually. Ecological models have, however, remained ubiquitous in the form of a generalist orientation that persists among practitioners. Ecological theory developed since the 1980s by Arne Naess (deep ecol- ogy) and Murray Bookchin (social ecology) is able to support a con- ceptualization of the person-in-environment surprisingly similar to that found in critical, feminist, and postmodern models of social work. From both Naess's (1989) and Bookchin s (1980, 1982) work, one can derive three axioms of an ecologically based philosophy for the human services: the necessity of a communal, rather than hierarchical and bureaucentric, perspective; recognition for the intrinsic value of indi- viduals and their communities; and the importance of mutuality and cooperation. These principles reflect advances in ecological thinking and are proposed as a starting place to define the foundational knowl- edge for a 21st-century social worker, the professional social ecologist. Changing the title of social workers to professional social ecologists would offer the field a view of itself and of its theory and principles of practice that better reflects what it has become.</page><page sequence="4">8 Revue canadienne de service social, voliime 20, numéro 1 A new name Social workers, as their name implies, are best known in Canadian and American contexts, the primary focus here, as those who do the work of providing human services (CASW, 2001). Work, by definition, is the "making, doing or acting upon" something as part of one's job. The term implies function, predetermined ends, and the otherness of the worker from his or her means of production. The "client," as that which is "other" from the worker, is implicitly the one to whom some- thing is done by the social worker. There are two problems with this role as worker. First, with the advent of the post-Fordist managerialism of the past decade in the United States, workers have seen the commodification of services and clients as both become functional elements in a managed system of care (Hugman, 1998; Ife, 1997). In Canada, the problem is similar. Restructuring and downsizing in health care, reflecting a neo- conservative shift in government policy, have resulted in the abandon- ment of social welfare programs and increased demands for public accountability. These changes have meant social workers must spend more time doing paperwork than in direct contact with clients. The term social work does not adequately reflect efforts by many in the field to resist these changes and form alliances with marginalized individu- als, their families, and their communities in ways that deconstruct hier- archies implicit in these functional relationships (see Ungar, 2002a). Even when social workers view their role as "working with" people, sys- temic constraints persist in services structured in ways that prevent egalitarian alliances. Secondly, the name social work is decidedly atheoretical. Work is something done far more than theorized. Consequently, the work of helping has been viewed as a non-professional activity, pertaining mostly to women, while scientific endeavours (and theory) have belonged stereotypically to men and to the professions they have his- torically dominated (see Akabas, 1995). For these reasons, social work- ers need to rename themselves. In searching for a new name, social work must consider the theo- retical orientation from which a name is to be derived. Though some, like Jerome Wakefield (1996b), wonder at the preoccupation of social workers with unifying theory, most disciplines use such theory as a way of privileging themselves and demarcating their intellectual territory (Hugman, 1998; Schön, 1987; Witkin, 1998). The evolution from per- son-in-environment to an ecological understanding of transactional human processes, as reflected in early casework and recent advances in social work, forms a common thread in the evolutionary fabric of the profession's identity. As Carel Germain and Alex Gitterman (1996) dis- cuss: "ecology is especially suitable as a metaphor for social work, given</page><page sequence="5">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 9 our historic commitment to the person-in-environment concept. The ecological metaphor helps the profession enact its social purpose of helping people and promoting responsive environments that support human growth, health, and satisfaction in social functioning" (p. 5). By tracing the person-in-environment thread from Abraham Flexner's cautious discounting of the profession in 1915, to Mary Richmond's system of diagnosis in 1917, to the 1929 Mumford Conference in which social casework became known as generic practice, to Harriet Bartlett's 1970 discussion of a common base for social work, and to the recent work of Eileen Gambrill (2001) and others, one sees clearly that eco- logical theory, which explains the transactional processes of the person- in-environment, is widely accepted as a foundation for professional practice (Germain &amp; Gitterman, 1996; Hartman, 1994; Karls &amp; Wan- drei, 1994; Ramsay, 1994). In attempting to deepen and update our understanding of ecolog- ical theory, mv goal is to continue in the tradition of using the science of ecology (albeit now a more critical and progressive version) symbol- ically as the basis for the profession. One could entertain a second level of discourse, however, that being to understand the role for a social ecologist in ensuring a sustainable and healthy environment. There is a growing acknowledgment that social workers must concern them- selves with the global environmental crisis (Besthorn, 2001; Coates, 2000; Hoff &amp; McNutt, 1994). As Marie Hoff and John McNutt (1994) observe, "the ecological framework has not led social workers to place greater emphasis on assessing the significance of the physical environ- ment itself; rather, it has served as a vehicle to argue for more attention to the dynamics of the social environment, in contrast to intrapsycho- dynamic models" (p. 18). Addressing the critical link between social work and the preservation of the natural environment follows from a redesign of social work as social ecology. A fuller discussion of this point is, however, beyond the more modest purpose of this discussion, which is to offer the science of an emerging ecology as the basis for practice, just as systems theory informed the work of our predecessors. Earlier social work ecologists The development of ecosystems and ecological models of social work practice are well documented elsewhere (Allen-Meares &amp; Lane, 1987; Wakefield, 1996a). As Carol Meyer (1983) notes in reviewing the antecedents to her own contribution to that development, "The move- ment from casework to social work was more than semantic; it meant ultimately that family, group, community, and organizational interven- tive approaches were to be included under the heading of social work practice, and that new efforts were to be made to intervene in the client's environment" (p. 12). Strangely, however, the discovery of eco-</page><page sequence="6">10 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 logical models of practice and theory brought the profession no closer to a unifying theory, despite the earlier work of people like Gordon Hamilton, Virginia Robinson, and Jessie Taft, who collectively argued that social work had "the dual focus of intervention with the person and environment" (Meyer, 1983, p. 14). These earlier models of ecosystems and ecological social work were built upon ecological theory as it existed at the time of their develop- ment. We can look back now and see the limitations of what was con- sidered progressive thought. In one example provided by John Spiegel in the early 1980s, work with a Puerto Rican family with a controlling father is undertaken in such a way that only the dominant culture or the patricentric values of the man are left unchallenged, while the values held by the women in the family are challenged and forced to adapt. As Spiegel (1982) notes: "Because we are dealing with families based on a Lineal or Collateral orientation, it is important to line ourselves up with the head of the family. This is normally the father" (p. 48). In the case example provided by Spiegel, the daughter must abide by the father's rules and thwart her emerging sexuality, unless it is expressed in terms dictated by the therapist, who advises supervised dating. A more postmodern or feminist approach might have looked for the strength within Puerto Rican culture itself and asked how women raise their daughters to be sexual beings despite the constraints of patri- archy. Whose assumption was it that, when it comes to domestic matters related to children's growth and development, men have the implicit, as well as explicit, power? A deeper, and more social, ecology is an attempt to resolve these issues by repositioning the profession of social work within a theoretical frame which reflects its emerging roots in more participatory, emancipatory, and critical discourses. Specifically, as this example shows, two problems with the ecology metaphor need to be addressed. First, use of the ecological metaphor is based most often on systems theories and works by Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968) and Gregory Bateson (1972), who focused almost exclusively on interactions with the social environment, ignoring the physical environment, especially all things natural. Secondly, these sys- tems-based models of practice, popularized by practitioners like Sal- vador Minuchin (1974), did not deconstruct the standpoints of those who decide which adaptations are determined to be the best. Implicit in these prior uses of the ecological metaphor is a bias towards indi- viduals fitting in with established social norms that maintain order amenable to those in power (Luepnitz, 1988). Authors like Germain, who updated their work to address such shortcomings, looked to critical, feminist, and postmodern theory to modify their models, though did not challenge the underlying prem- ises of a more deterministic ecology. For example, evolution in Ger- main's Life Model (Germain &amp; Gitterman, 1980, 1996) mirrors much</page><page sequence="7">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 11 of what occurred in the field of social work over the past 20 years. As Germain noted in 1981: "Most social workers agree that a concern for the person-in-environment is the distinguishing and unifying charac- teristic of social work" (p. 323). It was Germain's position that the envi- ronment receive more attention as a forum in which to practise. Ger- main's life model, in its initial development, focused on the transactional processes between persons and environments based on models well known to systems theorists. It fell prey, however, to the same heuristic thinking that plagued systems theory. As Germain noted in 1981, "social work seeks to promote adaptive transactions and to prevent or correct maladaptive ones" (p. 325). But who defines what is adaptive and maladaptive? In their 1996 edition of The Life Model of Social Work Practice , Germain and Gitterman added to the previous four components of their model (exchange or transaction; fit and adapta- tion between person and environment; life stressors and coping; and relatedness, competence, self-concept autonomy, and self-esteem) three more progressive elements: vulnerability, oppression, abuse or misuse of power, and social and technological pollution; habitat and niche; and life course, the trajectory taken by individuals with attention paid to social and cultural determinants. This greater emphasis on con- textualization, power and privilege, and the physical environment reflects advances by many of Germain's and Gitterman s contempo- raries in terms of cultural sensitivity, the politics of location, and the connection between social and natural worlds. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate in a simplified form the differences between ecological models based on systems theories and emerging models of human services. In Figure 1, the relationships between indi- viduals and their families, workers, human services agencies, and other social and cultural influences in their lives are represented as both transactional and structured in ordered hierarchies, with clear but over- lapping boundaries. In this model the emphasis is clearly on the indi- vidualistic bias of a systems perspective, with the individual in a posi- tion of prominence at the centre. Figure 2 illustrates a non-hierarchical, mutual model of individuals and their interactions with their environ- ments, in which boundaries are imperceptible and transactional processes unpredictable and less ordered. The individual is de-centred. This model fits with a deep and social ecology (discussed below), as well as with advances in social work theory and practice that challenge the "otherness" of the "client" (see Land, 1995; White, 1997).</page><page sequence="8">12 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 Figure 1 Relationship between Individuals and Their Environment: Ecological Systems Perspective Figure 2 Relationship between Individuals and Their Environment: A New Ecology Perspective</page><page sequence="9">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 13 An emerging ecological theory Ecological thought has been one counterpoint to the project of western enlightenment which posits the conquest of rationality over the bonds of nature. Tim Hayward (1995) sees ecologically informed social theory as a way to address the "dark underside" of western culture that has created wealth and cultural refinement for some at the price of inten- sified exploitation of others. David Pepper (1993) similarly asserts, "ecocentrics lack faith in modern large-scale technology and the tech- nical and bureaucratic elites, and they abhor centralisation and mate- rialism" (p. 33). Use of the phrase professional social ecologist implies a similar scepticism of modernity. The term is based on recent devel- opments in ecological theory, specifically advances in the fields of social ecology (Bookchin, 1980, 1982; Braun, 1995) and deep ecology (Hay- ward, 1995; Naess, 1989; Pepper, 1993). Readers are directed to fuller descriptions of both models found in works by Andrew Light (1998), Peter Reed and David Rothenberg (1993), and Michael Ungar (2002b). Murray Bookchin and social ecology Murray Bookchin eloquently demonstrated that human communities that take their lead from the natural world are much more likely to be non-hierarchical and socially just. Thus Bookchin' s social ecology sought to place human beings back into the natural order without falling prey to the anthropomorphism that objectifies and commodifies that which is other than human. As Bookchin (1982) suggests, it is sinister... the widespread use of hierarchical terms to provide natural phenomena with "intelligibility" or "order." What this procedure does accomplish is reinforce human social hierarchies by justifying the command of men and women as innate features of the "natural order." Human domination is thereby transcribed into the genetic code as bio- logically immutable - together with the subordination of the young by the old, women by men, and man by man. (p. 27) This seamless connection between the ascription to nature of its status as other and subsequent patterns of domination in human interaction makes Bookchin's theory particularly applicable to social work. Bookchin explores the "logic of differentiation," arguing that the dynamic stability, wholeness, completeness, and patterns of develop- ment found in natural communities can inform our understanding of similar dialectics in social realms: "When wholeness and completeness are viewed as the result of an immanent dialectic within phenomena, we do no more violence to the uniqueness of these phenomena than the principle of gravity does violence to the uniqueness of objects that fall within its 'lawfulness'"(p. 32). When applied to the realm of social</page><page sequence="10">14 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 interventions (the work done by social workers), these principles, which challenge logical differentiation, inform a practice that is non-hierar- chical, participatory, celebratory of diversity, and respectful of indige- nous knowledge and inherent self-worth. A challenge is offered to the "anthropology of hierarchy and domination" based on cultural assumptions of us (professionals) and them (clients). Arne Naess and deep ecology At about the same time as Bookchin was developing his critique in the United States, Arne Naess (1989) was in Norway reintroducing values to the increasingly rational façade of the "benign" exploitation of nature. His work reflected a more politicized environmentalism. Though these two streams of development in ecology have not always demonstrated a respectful mutual regard (Benton &amp; Short, 1999), they nevertheless share much in common. Naess argued, "We need types of societies and communities in which one delights in the value-creative aspects of equilibrium rather than the glorification of value-neutral growth; in which being together with other living beings is more impor- tant than exploiting or killing them" (p. 24). Herein lies both the attraction and applicability of deep ecology. Naess believed our individual "self" is connected with a larger metaphysical "Self," and that our development proceeds through phases towards awareness of our position within the whole, not unlike the self-centred child who grows first into a member of a family, and later a member of his or her community. Self-realization depends on our capacity to perceive our place in nature and the intrinsic worth of all aspects of our environment beyond their utility to us as humans. The implication is tolerance for other living things, as we are as much connected to them as we are to the significant people in our lives. This deeper ecology, though accused of being overly spiritual, is in fact well grounded in the everyday, providing an "ecosophy" that challenges patterns of dominance and exploitation (see Pepper, 1993). As Hay- ward (1995) has observed, our supposed enlightenment as rational beings distinct from the natural world has left us vulnerable to assump- tions of hierarchy and power. Unlike earlier notions of an ecological practice, such principles have the potential to inform interventions much more in keeping with the epistemological foundations of critical, feminist, and postmodern social work. These two interpretations of ecology demonstrate the evolution in the term ecology since Ernst Haeckel first used the word in 1868, refer- ring at the time to "the mutual relations of all the organisms which live in a single location, their adaption to the environment around them, the transformations produced by their struggle for existence" (cited in Hay- ward, 1995, p. 26). Ecological thought has grown in usage since then,</page><page sequence="11">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 15 though few writing in the applied social sciences have understood the construct in a non-mechanistic, non-deterministic way (Ungar, 2002b). One of the exceptions is John Coates (2000), who has linked a healthy environment to the goals of social work intervention. Coates says, "As the quest for progress, growth and profit has led to the exploitation of Earth, many groups of people have been systematically exploited and impoverished directly through the exploitation of their labour, or by the destruction and disruption of their livelihoods, or as a direct conse- quence of environmental destruction." Coates challenges the modernist roots of social work through his ecological critique. Similarly, Hayward (1995) says of vanguard ecology that "its methods and epistemology are not reductionist, its ontology is not dualistic, and its ethics are not atom- istic" (p. 23). Much the same could be said of emerging models of social work practice which have sought to respect diversity through the decon- struction of the relatively little discursive power and privilege found among the marginalized populations the profession serves. The new ecology and professional human services Deeply ecological and social ecological understandings of social rela- tions have the potential to offer the present-day professional human services "worker" congruence between practice and theory. As a guid- ing metaphor, these non-systemic understandings of ecology, when applied to human experience and the profession of social ecology, demonstrate respect for indigenous knowledge and sensitivity to dynamics of power, emphasize the inherent worth of all people (and elements of the non-human world), and are non-hierarchical, multi- level, and explicit as to the mutual dependency and cooperation of individuals and their communities. These concepts are not new to the profession of social work, but are not well reflected in the arcane model of the "worker," which by definition (and perception) implies the impo- sition of change on, or work being done to, the other, who is the client. These values can be translated into three axioms for theoretically sound ecological human services: 1) overcome the hierarchical and bureaucentric ideology of human services in which are embedded other forms of social prejudice (racism, classism, ablebodyism, sexism) which privilege some forms of knowledge over others; 2) recognize the intrinsic value of all community members and their contributions to the total experience of community; 3) value cooperation and mutuality in association with communities. The applicability of these three axioms as foundations for the practice of the professional social ecologist is evident from the contribution each makes to a deeper understanding of ecological human services.</page><page sequence="12">16 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 Combined, they distinguish the practice of the professional social ecol- ogist from that of the professional social worker. Challenging hierarchy and bureaucentrism A change in emphasis from working with people to being with people in organic, non-hierarchical relationships is already evident at the mar- gins of social work discourse in feminist, postmodern, structural, radi- cal, and other critically progressive writing, though has gone largely unarticulated in day-to-day practice within mandated services (Land, 1995; Margolin, 1997; Mullaly, 1997). The social ecologist, as a profes- sional, while concerned with the way in which social and physical envi- ronments affect people, would, if adhering to these philosophical foun- dations, be critically aware of his or her own place in the associational ecology of the communities in which he or she works. This adoption of ecological principles may force professional helpers to deconstruct the false dichotomy between communities and those tasked with serving them (Hornby, 1993). Even 70 years ago, Bertha Reynolds (1934) cau- tioned workers to pay attention to the hierarchical and privileged posi- tions from which they worked: "Social case workers with a basic philos- ophy of paternalism have made their methods more flexible without changing the underlying assumption of superiority" (p. 41). Informed by a deeper politicized ecology, the professional social ecologist demands fundamental change in the relationship between service and community. Reynolds understood that the professional case "worker" came to be needed only when society demanded a coordinated effort to deal with those less fortunate in order to ensure the safety and secu- rity of society as a whole. The axiom of non-hierarchy addresses this ongoing challenge to the field of social work. The dual mandate of rep- resentation/advocacy and control, which has made communities largely distrustful of and disenfranchised from the bureaucracies that serve them, is reconceptualized in this model of professional practice. This reflects what some have already argued can be the basis for a more equitable relationship, in which power is shared and mutual agendas negotiated (see Fontan &amp; Shragge, 1998; Smale, 1995; Smale, Tusón, Cooper, Wardle 8c Crosbie, 1988; Ungar, 2002a). Intrinsic value of competing world views For the professional human services worker, social ecology informs the view that all humans have intrinsic value (just as toads and ticks do in the natural ecology), despite our bias towards a fundamental utilitari- anism. Like many social workers now practising, a new ecology embraces the principle of intrinsic worth. This is congruent with the proposed mandate of the professional social ecologist, as detailed here, who values each community for what it has to offer.</page><page sequence="13">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 17 These ideas are congruent with postmodern interventions now popular in work with individuals, families, and communities. Michael White (1995), Joan Laird (1993), Cynthia Franklin (Franklin &amp; Nurius, 1998), David Epston (White &amp; Epston, 1990), Ann Hartman (1994), Kenneth Gergen (1994), Mary Rodwell (1998), and others are demonstrating in their work the need to accept individual client and group constructions of reality as foundational to empowering prac- tice. In the work of the postmodern helper, there is celebration of the multiplicity of human experience and constructions of identity along lines of ethnicity, race, gender, class, and ability. This becomes par- ticularly important when the client's context is socially and culturally different from that of the helper. In such cases the onus is on the pro- fessional to discuss and celebrate divergent solutions to everyday problems. This leads, necessarily, to an embrace of relativism and the pitting of one view against another. The Tibetan astrologer who argues his or her science is as legitimate as the western physician's is not unlike the client who uses corporal punishment which Child and Family Services finds abusive. In both cases, claims to authenticity are legitimate from within the individual's (and sometimes his or her cul- ture's) perspective. However, not all discourses are created equal. An ecology that val- ues intrinsic worth also recognizes that there are mutually agreed upon rules that ensure survival. The challenge is to balance the need for nor- mative social interaction with the threat of hegemony and cultural dominance. This is where the inspiration that comes from a deeper ecological point of view can help. A new ecology can provide a guide for practitioners to select and forego theories to arrive at the best fit with their process of intervention through the respect shown to mar- ginalized people and their discourses. An ecology that supports a crit- ical deconstruction of power and discourse provides a starting point to evaluate the rules by which we are supposed to live. Of course, the prac- tices chosen by professional social ecologists will likely still be based upon the accepted bias and empiricism that prejudices us toward what are thought to be the best models of practice available. Basing our pro- fessional identity on a body of knowledge that purports to celebrate diversity (rather than changing others) means we will base our choices of intervention on negotiations with those marginalized to identify these best practices. Thus we may still dismiss the Tibetan astrologer in favour of the western scientist, just as we dismiss the viewpoint of those who believe that to spare the rod is to spoil the child. In both these cases, however, negotiations for legitimacy of one viewpoint over another has determined (at least at the given time) what we will find acceptable. In years to come, as in years past, we can expect to experi- ence the contradiction of the practice values we now hold as these negotiations continue.</page><page sequence="14">18 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 Far from arguing for untempered relativism, Peter Leonard (1997) has suggested that, in discovering and documenting localized dis- courses, one finds many points of convergence between social groups. He explains that postmodern relativism is, in practice, offset by adher- ence to values held as "universal by consent." From these, clients and practitioners can build dialectically a mutual set of goals for interven- tion. It is worth noting that Bookchin wrestled with a similar ungrounded relativism found among ecologists. He challenged the concept of intrinsic worth as uncritically espoused by deep ecology extremists who believe, for example, that a virus has as much right to exist as the people it infects. Instead Bookchin (1982), like Leonard, sees the need for a dialectic between uniqueness and wholeness. Valu- ing the intrinsic worth of the other means avoiding cultural imperial- ism in practice, even though at times the dominant world view may necessarily impose itself on those with less privileged and local con- structions in what is understood as an expression of a widely agreed upon dominant value system. As White (1995) and others have sug- gested, in such cases the worker is obligated to deconstruct, through his or her interventions, the dominant discourse and its impact on marginalized clients, even if that discourse cannot be changed. Mutuality and cooperation with and in community The professional social ecologist creates a symbiotic human services prac- tice that emphasizes close association with those being served. Depen- dency and the provision of resources are complementary aspects of these relationships. Ecological principles of mutuality and cooperation encour- age dependency as functional adaptation when there are limited resources. Professionals who collaborate are more likely to be helpful to the communities they collectively serve, especially when the nature of these collaborations includes the community in non-hierarchical, sub- stantive ways (Graham &amp; Barter, 1999; Martinez-Brawley, 1993). Too often, however, the "footprint" (to borrow Wackernagel &amp; Rees's [1996] ecological term) of the professional and his or her agency has consumed an excessive proportion of the financial resources earmarked for the community (McKnight, 1995). A greater emphasis on mutuality and sharing of resources would acknowledge that social support, health care, employment, education, counselling, and child care can all be expanded and nurtured ad infinitum when communities perceive their internal and external interactions as contributing to their individual and collective well-being. A reliance on the services of professionals should be tem- pered with the realization that oftentimes communities that are provided adequate resources can look after themselves. An emerging discourse in social work demonstrates that we need to incorporate state-mandated structures better into the ecology of com-</page><page sequence="15">Canadian Social Work Review, Volume 20, Number 1 19 munities and community-based initiatives (see Cameron 8c Vanderwo- erd, 1997; Van Den Berg &amp; Grealish, 1996). Thus, as my colleagues and I have noted elsewhere (Ungar, Teram &amp; Picketts, 2001), we need to challenge the dichotomous thinking that partializes service systems. Institutions, for example, can become extensions of their communities, rather than communities being, from a bureaucentric perspective, there to meet the needs of government agencies which require resources (such as placements) to manage clients. This change is already evident in practice, though seldom articulated clearly in the us- them discourse that views parts of service systems as interrelated but distinct. A more progressive ecological view reconceptualizes these rela- tionships as being based on mutuality, in which all parts acknowledge their need and service to the others. Far from being cynical, from an ecological perspective service providers are dependent on clients just as clients are on providers (though the nature of this dependency is expe- rienced differently by each). A new ecological discourse Ironically, while Michel Foucault (1976/1954) and Kenneth Gergen (1991) were building the under-girders for postmodern thought in the field of mental health, and feminist scholars such as Carol Gilligan (1982) and Jean Baker Miller (1976) were creating the architecture of egalitarianism in psychology, social work persisted with systems-based models of case management that were quickly becoming dated in light of competing discourses. As Leslie Margolin (1997) writes in her cri- tique of our present-day calcified and hierarchical social services, social workers have been caught in a system that tries to deny their power: "The rhetoric of client empowerment makes social workers vulnera- ble - manipulable - by masking from them their own exercise of power.... To do social work, social workers have to learn to ignore their exercise of power, to hide their memories in complex amnesias, to alter their sense of time, place, and person" (p. 131). On a more positive note, Anne Hartman (1994) editorializes, "We must enter into a col- laborative search for naming with our clients and listen to their voices, their narratives, and their constructions of reality" (p. 26). Finally, as Malcolm Payne (1991) argues, "A modern social work theory must therefore respond to the modern social construction of reality both by clients and by social workers and their environments; if it fails to do so, it will be unsuccessful" (p. 22). In response to these challenges, social work must recognize in its name (and theory and practice) its shift from being a functionary of the state (workers) to being a constituency of professionals who specialize in nurturing and facilitating discursive and instrumental resistance to oppression.</page><page sequence="16">20 Revue canadienne de service social, volume 20, numéro 1 Though this discussion is limited to examining only a few aspects of deep and social ecology, it remains to be seen whether this interpretation allows for the unification of diverse social work models. To its credit, the practice of a professional social ecology is still an expression of the origi- nal mandate of social work to serve the person in the context of his or her environment. In practical terms, the evolving science of ecology provides social work with principles that can inform a more egalitarian and com- munal day-to-day practice (Coates, 2000). Moving in this direction pro- fessionally, however, is likely to be as difficult as it was for earlier pioneers to adopt systems theory, family therapy, feminism, or postmodernism. As Susan Kemp and her colleagues (Kemp, Whittaker &amp; Tracy, 1997) muse: The "problem" of the environment is in large part a function of the choices made by a developing profession in search of external recog- nition and status. As a minor profession, linked inextricably in the public mind with poverty, dysfunction, and social marginality, social work has always been particularly sensitive to the charge that it lacks a defined practice supported by a distinctive and transmissible body of knowledge and skill, (p. 45) Rather than being a weakness, social work's person-in-environment focus has the potential to make the profession the front-runner in the burgeoning field of socially ecological human services which promote egalitarian social relations. An ecological society, like the natural order it mimics, promotes unity and mutual respect antithetical to racism, sexism, or other forms of exploitation. Bringing about such a social order demands a model of intervention in the human services synonymous with ecological princi- ples. This is arguably best achieved not by those who perform "work" upon others, but by the activities of professional social ecologists whose practice manifests an ecosophy that focuses on community, values the intrinsic worth of individuals and their communities, and promotes mutuality and cooperation in the delivery of services.
