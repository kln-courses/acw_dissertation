<plain_text><page sequence="1">337 ORAL THEME AND WRITTEN TEXTS Summary. - Although there can be no doubt concerning the written composition of Catullus' Poem IV and there are reasons to assume written composition for the Anglo- Saxon Dream of the Rood and Husband's Message , analysis according to principles originally formulated by Milman Parry and Albert Lord shows that all three poems rely on the same oral-formulaic type-scene. Historical considerations suggest the improbability of direct influence and argue in favor of independent use of a common theme also found in Homer in a more rudimentary form and subsequently adopted by Vergil. Chronological juxtaposition of the texts further suggests a progressive intensification of the anthropomorphic quality of the imagery and illustrates the kind of variations to be expected in a given type-scene when employed both by poets working in a pri- marily oral-formulaic tradition and by poets working in a primarily written tradition. It is a statistical fact that the ideas which Milman Parry first expressed in 19281 about the composition of Homeric verse have since become a major concern with students of literature, as may be inferred from a glance at The Haymes Bibliography of the Oral Theory .2 Notwithstanding the acci- dental omission of an important essay by Tauno Mustanoja,3 this indis- pensable work of reference clearly illustrates the evolution of Parry's original ideas into what has since come to be known as the Parry-Lord theory of oral-formulaic composition, its applications to various ancient and modern literatures, and the explosion of scholarship which it has caused in recent years. It lists well over five-hundred separate titles in various languages, and the fact that more than seventy-six percent of these were published in 1960 or later serves as a reminder of the formidable impact which Albert Lord's The Singer of Tales 4 has had upon subsequent scholar- 1 Milman Parry, UÉpithète Traditionelle dans Homère (Paris, 1928), and Les Formules et la Métrique d'Homère (Paris, 1928), translated in English in The Making of Homeric Verse: the Collected Papers of Milman Parry , ed.

Since 1973, when The Haymes Bibliography came out, publication of research in oral-formulaic composition has continued with unabated vigor, including a special issue of the Forum for Modern Language Studies 1 and three particularly significant books, by Joseph Duggan,2 Michael Nagler,3 and Ching Hsien Wang 4 respectively. Among the many fringe benefits which this line of investigation has brought to our understanding of literature, we must count the realization that many a presumably-written work includes elements clearly typical of oral-formulaic composition. Scholars have been quick to seize upon the significance of this observation, so that Larry Benson, for example, has been able to argue the futility of "any lingering suspicion that the relative percentages of formulas might be used to distinguish between oral and lettered productions" and to assert that "we should assume written com- position"5 in respect to a fair number of Anglo-Saxon works sharing certain Inconsistencies in Homer and Oral Poetry," Transactions of the American Philological Association , LXIX (1938), 439^45. 1 Forum for Modern Language Studies , X (1974), in addition to Albert B. Lord's pen- etrating evaluation of the current state of research in oral-formulaic composition ("Per- spectives on Recent Work on Oral Literature" [pp. 187-210]), includes particularly impressive essays in this field by Daniel F. Melia (Old Irish), Donald K. Fry (Anglo- Saxon), Hans H. Bäuml and Edda Spielmann (Middle High German), Joseph J. Duggan (Old Spanish and Old French), L. P. Harvey (Renaissance Spanish), and Elizabeth A. Warner (nineteenth-century Russian). 2 Joseph J. Duggan, The Song of Roland : Formulaic Style and Poetic Craft (Berkeley: University of California, 1973) gives a brilliant and thoroughly documented assessment of the arguments on both sides of the oral-formulaic controversy and demonstrates the formulaic nature of Roland. 3 Michael N. Nagler, Spontaneity and Tradition: a Study in the Oral Art of Homer (Ber- keley: University of California, 1974), studies the oral-formulaic pattern as "an ex- pression of the poet's conscious or unconscious purpose; . . . part of his 'semiotic system'" (p. xxiv) and thus makes a truly major contribution which promises to influence later studies in formulaic composition. 4 Ching Hsien Wang, The Bell and the Drum: Shih Ching as Formulaic Poetry in an Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California, 1974), demonstrates in certain Chinese poems "clear characteristics and abundant traces of composition by themes, to an extent comparable in technique with classical Greek and Old English poetry" (p. 128). 5 Larry D.

Bäuml and Edda Spielmann have come to reject the possibility that "the trans- mitted written versions of the Nibelungenlied are records of an oral per- formance" and to state that it is "logical to conclude that the oral tradi- tion . . . served as the basis for the written composition of the transmitted text by a literate poet for a literate audience."1 Conversely, it should be permissible to argue that the examination of written texts based on an oral tradition may have something to tell us about formulaic composition. Robert P. Greed, Lord, and Nagler have independently demonstrated the presence of similar oral-formulaic themes in the Odyssey and Beowulf ' both of which they assume to fall within the category of oral poetry.2 My purpose here is to point out vestiges of a similar coincidence between texts likewise drawn from different Indo-European traditions but including one written poem in one language and two presumably written poems in another language: Catullus' Poem IV and the anonymous Anglo-Saxon The Dream of the Rood and The Husbanďs Message. There is, of course, no question about the written nature of Catullus' production, and I tend to think that the burden of the proof in respect to the two Anglo-Saxon poems falls upon the proponents of oral composition: the detectable influence of Latin hymns suggests a literate composer for The Dream of the Rood? and the presence of five runes at the end of The Husband's Message argues that the poem must have been composed by someone familiar with written characters and addressed to an audience capable of deciphering them. The three poems deal with completely different subjects, but each con- 1 Franz H.

Howard R. Patch, "Liturgical Influence in The Dream of the Rood" PMLA , XXIV (1919), has pointed out extremely close textual similarities between The Dream of the Rood and other Anglo-Saxon and Latin religious texts, including Elene (p. 235) and the Vexilla Regis Prodeunt (p. 248).</page><page sequence="4">340 ALAIN RENOIR tains an account of the earlier life of a wooden artifact. With Catullus, it is the swiftest of boats, now fallen into desuetude, and it tells of its former life as a forest atop a majestic summit: et hoc negat minacis Adriatici negare litus insulasve Gycladas Rhodumque nobilem horridamque Traciam Propontida trucemve Ponticum sinum, ubi iste post phasellus antea fuit cornata silva: nam Gy torio in iugo loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma. Amastri Pontica et Gytore buxifer, tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima ait phasellus; ultima ex origine tuo stetisse dicit in cacumine ... 1 With The Dream of the Rood , it is the Holy Gross, and it tells how it was once a tree which men felled at the edge of a forest: f&gt;aet waes geara iu, (ic ļ)aet gyta geman), ļ)aet ic waes aheawen holtes on ende, astyred of stefne minum.2 With The Husband** Message , it is a rune-stick, and it tells its reader how it was once a live tree: Nu ic onsundran J)e secgan wille [ ] treocyn ic tudre aweox ... 3 If we submit all three texts to the same kind of schematic analysis which David Growne used years ago in his brief but rightfully influential study of the oral-formulaic theme of the hero on the beach,4 we can formulate the following paradigm: an elongated , man-made , wooden object of any size (a 1 Gaius Valerius Catullus, Carmen IV, 11. 5-16, in Catull: Gedichte , ed.

One may wish to note that the rune-stick is the speaker of the entire Husband's Mes- sage, while the words of the Cross are part of a dream related by the speaker of The Dream of the Rood , and the statements in the Latin poem are in the third person with only Catullus' word to let us know that the boat is actually speaking (dicit [1. 16]). These differences, however, may be con- sidered variations on a theme and do not detract from the paradigm for- mulated above. If a source be needed at any cost to explain the presence of the theme in Catullus' poem, one might be tempted to turn to the first book of the Iliad on the assumption that the Latin poet may have been familiar with the famous scene where Achilles, whom Athena has just talked out of killing Agamemnon, gives vent to his wrathful frustration by calling his commander an ill-mannered thief and a shirker of battle. Before the essembled Acheans, Achilles swears never again to obey Aga- memnon and takes as witness of his oath an elongated, man-made, wooden object - in this case a gold-studded axfjjiTQov - of which he tells us that it was cut off a tree in the mountains: áÁÁ' ex roi èçéo) xai ¿ni jLiéyav õoxov ôfjiovjLiar vai /uà tóôe 0XT)7iTQ0V, to juèv otf TtoTE qyókfa I xai õÇovç qwöEi, ¿nei òr) tiqcüto. tojuìjv èv oqeooi Mkoinev, ovó ' avadrļkrļOEi- tieqí yáq çá è /aÀxòç eAei/je tpvÃÂa te xai qpÀoióv- vvv avré juiv vleç ' Axaicòv ¿v nakáfifiQ (poqéovOL ôixaoTióhoi , oí te 6¿fiiaTag TiQÒç Aiòç eíqvgltcii- ó ôé toi /Liéyaç ëaoerai õqxoç' tf 7ZOT 'A%Mr]Oç 7ioQi¡ ïl-ETai viaç 'Axaicw ovfÂJiavraç' tòte ô ' ov ti ôw^asai âxyvfiEvóç tieq XQaiOfÂEÎv, eiü T ãv noXXoi v " Extoqoç âvôçxxpóvoio OvfioxoVTEç 7ibrca)Of ov ô9 ëvôodi Qvfiòv âfivÇEiç XOiófievoç ö t ägtarv 9 Axaiœv ovôèv ëriaaç.1 Homer's image shows up again in Vergil's Aeneid , where King Latinus uses it to assert his will to keep peace: 1 Homer, Iliad, I-XII, cd.

Superficially, the Homeric and Vergilian accounts may seem closer to the Anglo-Saxon than does Catullus' poem, since a cross, a rune-stick, and a scepter look much more like each other than a boat does to any of them. They lack, however, a key part of our initial paradigm insofar as neither of these two speaks to tell its own story. In fact, one might even wish to note a chronological progression in the human and oratorical behavior attributed to the artifact: Homer gives it no explicit anthropo- morphic quality; Catullus explicitly states that it tells its own story, and his use of the adjective "hairy" to describe the forest whence it came (i cornata silva [1. 11]) adds something to the human analogy; Vergil explicitly recalls its having had hair, arms, and a family ,but gives it neither voice nor autobiographical aspiration; The Dream of the Rood has it tell its own story within a dream narrated by the speaker of the poem; and The Hus- band's Message goes all the way in making it the actual narrator of the entire poem.2 In other words, it appears that we may have two different 1 Publius Vergilus Maro, Aeneid , XII, 11. 202-211, in The Works of Virgil, ed. John Conington and Henry Nettleship (Hildesheim, 1963), III, 423-424. 2 The respective dates of The Dream of the Rood and The Husbands Message are by no means certain: Stanley B. Greenfield, A Critical History of Old English Literature (New York, 1968), p. 126, considers the feasibility of a date around 700 A.D. for The Dream of the Rood ; though he suggests no date for The Husband's Message , he discusses it (pp. 225-226) along with poems usually assigned to a later period. David M. Zesmer, Guide to English Literature from Beowulf Through Chaucer and Medieval Drama (New York, 1961), pp. 50-51, discusses it in a section including poems which he dates in the ninth and tenth centuries; and Kemp Malone, in A Literary History of England, ed. Albert C. Baugh (New York, 1948), p. 92, dates it "not later than c. 950."</page><page sequence="7">Oral Theme and Written Texts 343 but related traditions - a silent one represented by Homer and Vergil, and a prosopopoeic one represented by Catullus and the Anglo-Saxon texts - and that they both become increasingly anthropomorphic with the passage of years. If we wish to discount the passage in the Aeneid as being an elaboration of genius upon the text of the Iliad rather than an intrinsic contribution, we lose one tradition and gain a simplified chronological progression. Any assessment of these tentative classifications should con- sider that, from one point of view, the difference between the forms taken by the artifact in Catullus' poem and the other texts may not necessarily be so clear-cut as it seems within the context of the twentieth century.1 The Latin noun phaselus, with which Catullus opens his poem and which he uses to designate his boat, is normally used to designate a bean, either in or out of the pod. The image evoked by association is thus much closer to the artifacts of the other poems than it would have been if a more common word had been used - navícula or scapha , for example - and we need not be licensed psychiatrists to know that human beings will occasion- ally let their mind's eye follow the mere suggestion of an ancillary image, as when the Beowulf-poet allows his perfectly legitimate choice of hilde- gicel ("battle-icicle") for "sword" to launch him on a picture of an ice- bound world thawing with the coming of spring: Pa.

Elliot Van Kirk Dobbie (New York, 1953). 8 Creed, Lord, and Nagler do not make the Odyssey a source for the oral-formulaic themes found both in that poem and in Beowulf ( cf n. 2, p. 339), and there are no compelling reasons to assume the direct influence of Archaic Greece upon Anglo- Saxon England.</page><page sequence="8">344 ALAIN RENOIR the presence of the same formulaic paradigm in these two poems and in Catullus' Poem IV : (a) the two Anglo-Saxon poets may have emulated Catullus' own text or a close derivative thereof, or (b) they may have done the same thing in respect to the Aeneid and added the prosopopoeic autobiography on their own, or (c) they may have drawn, consciously or otherwise, upon a common formulaic theme independently available to classical antiquity. Although not totally out of the question, the case for making Catullus an immediate or almost immediate model for the Anglo-Saxon poems seems too weak to warrant serious consideration within the scope of this investigation,1 and one may likewise hesitate to endorse Vergil's candidacy.2 Without totally rejecting the possibility of these two explanations, I incline toward the view that both the classical and the Anglo-Saxon texts have independently drawn upon the same theme, thus conforming to an established pattern which has been mentioned above in respect to the Odyssey and Beowulf and offering the practical advantage of enabling us to bypass the nearly insoluble problems likely to plague any attempt at determining the indebtedness of formulaic materials.3 If one 1 Though not everyone accepts James A. S. McPeek's view, in his Catullus in Strange and Distant Britain (Cambridge, Mass., 1939), p. xv, that "the direct influence of Catullus is not certainly observable in England before the beginning of the sixteenth century," one must agree with Georges LaFaye, ed., Catulle: Poésies (Paris, 1949), pp. xxviii-xxix, that Isidore of Seville's probable knowledge of the classical poet does not imply the latter's influence until the fourtheenth century, when a manuscript of the poems was supposedly discovered. a Even though many Anglo-Saxon scholars, including Aldhelm, were presumably familiar with Vergil, attempts by the most impressive modern scholars at finding echoes of the Aeneid in Anglo-Saxon formulaic poetry (see, e.g š, Friedrich Klaeber, ed., Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg [Boston, 1941], n. to 1. 1357 if.) are subject to reservations, as I have tried to suggest in respect to Beowulf in my "Originality, Influence, Imitation: Two Mediaeval Phases," in Proceedings of the IVth Congress of the International Comparative Literature Association , ed. François Jost (The Hague, 1966), esp. pp. 740 and 744-745. It is significant that Gilbert Highet, who is understandably eager to argue the presence of classical influence whenever possible, makes only three mentions of Vergil in the chapter devoted to the Anglo-Saxon period in his The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature (Oxford, 1949), pp. 22-47. •As Lord has argued in The Singer of Tales , e.g ņ, p. 115, the oral-formulaic poet's technical and psychological framework renders inoperative the modern concepts of imitation and originality. In my "The Terror of the Dark Waters: a Note on Virgilian and Beowulfian Techniques," Harvard English Studies, V (1974), esp. pp. 147-150, I have discussed some of the implications of the Parry-Lord theory upon the search</page><page sequence="9">Oral Theme and Written Texts 345 can find vestiges of oral composition in written Renaissance prose,1 there is no compelling reason for the automatic rejection of possible instances of oral-formulaic theme survival in a written Latin poem of the pre- Christian period or in Anglo-Saxon poems presumably written but none- theless composed in accordance with oral-formulaic practices. If we return for a moment to our paradigm, we note that, whereas Catullus' Poem IV shares with the Anglo-Saxon poems the prosopopoeic and autobiographical urges of the wooden object, it lacks the element of fateful tension present in all the other texts: in the Iliad the tension is the result of a parley which will alter the fate of the warriors concerned, and Vergil borrows this situation from Homer; in The Dream of the Rood , the tension is the result of the Crucifixion, which will affect the fate of mankind; and in The Husbanďs Message the tension is the result of a situation in which the fates of both the sender and the receiver of the message will be affected by its contents. We may accordingly surmise that, whereas Catullus uses the whole theme, he is less aware than the others of the circumstances in which it should normally appear, and this lack of awareness is the price which a poet may expect to pay for literacy. As for the theme itself, I suspect that its origin owes something to the belief that inanimate objects may have a life and mind of their own, as illustrated in Kormak* s Saga when Skeggi declines to lend the sword Skofnung to Kormak because of his conviction that the weapon and the man have irreconcilable temperaments: "Skofnungr er tómlátr, en £&gt;ú ert óôlátr ok oölundaör."2 This anthropo- morphic belief partly justifies the need which formulaic poets seem to have for tracing the history of important objects, as in the case of the shield of Achilles or the sword of Roland. However correct these surmisses may be, the materials examined above make it clear that the methodical investi- gation of written or possibly written texts from different ages and traditions for specific sources of formulaic poetry regardless of the oral or written nature of its actual composition. 1 Walter J. Ong, "Oral Residue in Tudor Prose Style," PMLA , LXXX (1965), discusses oral residue, which he contrasts to "consciously cultivated oral effects" (p. 146) as in, "for example, Joyce or Hemingway or Faulkner" (p. 153) and concludes that "the oral elements ... in Tudor prose are akin to those in the Iliad and the Odyssey " (p. 153). 2 Kormdks Saga , cap. ix, in Vatnsdœla Saga , Hallfreõar Saga , Kormáks Saga , ed.
