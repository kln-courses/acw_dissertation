<plain_text><page sequence="1">Afterthoughts on the Animal T_ --1 1 WoriM Akira Mizuta Lippit Even inarticulate noises (of beasts, for instance) do indeed reveal something, yet none of them is a name. -Aristotle1 This investigation of philosophy and the animal begins at the scene of a crime, the fourth story of a house on a fictitious street in Paris. The occupants of the house have been brutally slain and the Pari- sian police are scrambling for answers. Under the heading "Extra- ordinary Murders," the Gazette gives notice of the affair: A widow and her daughter, Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, have been found bludgeoned, mutilated, and partially dismembered- the daughter forced into the chimney, the mother thrown from the window. The domestic assault appears to have extended even to the house itself: "The apartment was in the wildest disorder-the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions."2 "To this hor- rible mystery there is not as yet," the newspaper reports, "the slight- est clue."3 Still missing are a perpetrator and motive, an explanation of the crime. The Gazette concludes: "A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris-if indeed a murder has been committed at all."4 Edgar Allan Poe's 1841 story "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" brings to the surface a characteristically modern catastrophe: the domicile of mankind has been assailed from the outside, indeed by the outside. The social and architectural structures that protect the human world appear to have weakened, exposing those inside, like the L'Espanayes, to the dangers of the wildside. Poe's story begins, MLN, 109 (1994): 786-830 ? 1994 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M L N 787 one can say, with an emergency, a cry reverberating with the call of the wild. Among those listening to these sounds is Poe's invention C. Auguste Dupin, the first figure of modern detection. Dupin has been assigned the task of trailing a murderer whose identity, as the narrative progresses, appears to exceed the realm of the human. At stake in his pursuit is the delineation of the criminal being and of the world within which criminal acts take place, and as it proceeds his investigation of the "inhuman" murder reveals the forms of ani- mality that begin to coalesce in the exteriorities of the wild. The crime has been committed, of course, by an orangutan. But can an orangutan or any other animal be considered a criminal, be forced to take responsibility for its actions in the human world? Perhaps there has been no crime at the house on Rue Morgue, after all-only death. Animals are, according to Aristotle, lacking in logos and are therefore incapable of ethical behavior and thus of crime. Noting the anthropomorphic nature of ethics, Kojeve explains that "every morality is an implicit anthropology, and man is speaking of his very being when he judges his actions morally."5 Animals do not inhabit the philosophical world projected and animated by human beings. Accordingly, as the case unfolds, the crime itself disappears: the criminal trespass dissolves into a series of accidental encounters between two women and an ape-an arbitrary slaying of two human beings by an animal. Thus, despite the suggestion of a perverse psychopathology at work in the grotesque killings, Poe's death scene reverts back into the flow of "everyday life," everyday savagery- there are, in the end, no monsters, only animals. Reexamining the premises of this case, however, one finds that the extraordinary resists being reduced to the ordinary. Indeed, the distinction between these states appears to have collapsed: one can no longer determine whether one is in realm of the ordinary or the extraordinary, the difference between the two seeming to have shifted to a more subtle distinction between the ordinary-in-the- extraordinary and the extraordinary-in-the-ordinary. On the one hand, "Rue Morgue" depicts the "savage" transgression of human society, indeed humanity, by an orangutan, while on the other, Poe's narrative recounts the framing of human paradigms around animal acts: the oscillation between the mundane and the fantastic, in fact, helps to establish the compelling uncertainty that sustains Poe's narrative. Throughout the newspaper reports and eyewitness ac- counts, Dupin remarks, the assassin's nationality and gender-key points in the constitution of an identity-remain unascertainable.</page><page sequence="3">788 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT Re-tracing his hypothesis, Dupin poses the following speculation to his accomplice, the narrator: ... an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from hu- manity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your fancy?6 Dupin's reasoning launches the reader into an unintelligible world in which the familiar indices of language and gender recede beyond the grasp of comprehension, or even recognition. Indeed, among the audible facts that are gathered by the police, the only evidence remains defiantly foreign. Each witness spoke of the killer's voice "as that of a foreigner. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen.... No words-no sounds resembling words- were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable."7 In this instance, language and the demand upon the faculty of recognition that it imposes actively impede the crime's solution: as Heidegger remarks in another context, human beings have not yet learned to "listen abstractly."8 The "witnesses" to the Rue Morgue atrocities have misconstrued the startled, panicked cries of the orangutan for those of a human being. From the indistinguishable noises that arose during the struggle, each witness thought that he or she was able to discern (without understanding) the alien tongue of a foreigner. Each audi- tor was able to project the language and identity of a foreign being into the open spaces of animal noise. The voice, as opposed to the look, tends to provoke such misidentifications. Rousseau, for exam- ple, attempting to introduce his study of the origin of language, quickly loses control of his rhetoric when he reaches the thresholds of speech. Slipping into philological abstraction and a phonetic dilemma, Rousseau writes: Speech distinguishes man among the animals; language distinguishes nations from each other; one does not know where a man comes from until he has spoken. Out of usage and necessity, each learns the language of his own country. But what determines that this language is that of his country and not of another? In order to tell, it is necessary to go back to some principle that belongs to the locality itself and antedates its cus- toms, for speech, being the first social institution, owes its form to natural causes alone.9</page><page sequence="4">M L N 789 As Poe's story illustrates, however, animals may also be mistaken for human beings when one confuses rhythmical sounds (grunts of exertion, for example) for semantic structure (an unfamiliar but distinctly foreign language). Moreover, while animals are deprived of language, they are nonetheless equipped with a semiotic capacity. Animals are able to transmit the cries that signal their presence without possessing the means of referring to absent objects or ab- stract concepts. In fact Derrida has suggested, reversing the usual distinction between mankind and the animals, that what is charac- teristically animal is the inability to refrain from self-exhibition; that language may best be considered to follow from the capacity for silence-restraint-rather than as the function of self-determination and expression.10 What, then, is the nature of the animal's disclosure? What does the animal, "which can neither choose to keep silent, nor keep a secret," so irrepressibly reveal?11 Without the semiosis that trans- forms phone into logos, animal utterances, like the "non-sense" of foreigners, can only portray the dynamic of affects and bodily states. Philosophy has always maintained the distinction between races and species, language and signals. Aristotle, for example, argues that while the capacity to signal pleasure and pain exists in all animals, only man possesses the ability to form words from those signals: And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the percep- tion of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust.12 Animals form, in Aristotle's account, finite sentimental communi- ties-their communications restricted to the expression of sensa- tions, the reach of that expression remaining within the immediate horde. Apparently, not only does the expressive range of human speech exceed that of the animal's cry (which is limited to the two poles of affect, pleasure and pain), but speech establishes a larger realm of communication. While animals convey their affects only "to one another," Aristotle suggests that the effects of speech reach a wider audience and carry greater implications, for instance the foundation of justice. The animal, signified by its cry, supplements the classical opposi- tion between logos and phone. Derrida explains the separation of</page><page sequence="5">790 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT speech from the cry, and the problematic of language that it intro- duces: [Speech's] system requires that it be heard and understood immediately by whoever emits it. It produces a signifier which seems not to fall into the world, outside the ideality of the signified, but to remain sheltered- even at the moment that it attains the audiophonic system of the other- within the pure interiority of auto-affection. It does not fall into the exteriority of space, into what one calls the world, which is nothing but the outside of speech. Within so-called "living" speech, the spatial exteri- ority of the signifier seems absolutely reduced. It is in the context of this possibility that one must pose the problem of the cry-of that which one has always excluded, pushing it into the area of animality or of madness, like the myth of the inarticulate cry-and the problem of speech (voice) within the history of life.13 Problematizing the fall of speech out of the world, Derrida ex- poses the proximity of all speech to the inarticulate cries of animals and opens to scrutiny a long history of tension between the figure of the animal and the limits of discourse. Indeed, while logos enjoys a singular privilege in the philosophical hierarchy, zoon always supple- ments that privilege, undermining its autonomy. For example, in Plato's Sophist, Derrida explains, "[ ] ogos is a zoon": An animal that is born, grows, belongs to phusis. Linguistics, logic, dialec- tics, and zoology are all in the same camp. In describing logos as zoon, Plato is following certain rhetors and so- phists before him who, as a contrast to the cadaverous rigidity of writing, had held up the living spoken word, which infallibly conforms to the necessities of the situation at hand, to the expectations and demands of the interlocutors present, and which sniffs out the spots where it ought to produce itself, feigning to bend and adapt at the moment it is actually achieving maximum persuasiveness and control. Logos, a living, animate creature, is thus also an organism that has been engendered. An organism: a differentiated body proper with a center and extremities, joints, a head, and feet. In order to be "proper," a written discourse ought to submit to the laws of life just as a living discourse does. Logographical necessity (anangke logographike) ought to be analogous to biological, or rather zoological necessity.14 By tracing logos back to its origin as zoon, Derrida exposes the early attempts in Greek metaphysics to unite the living body with the "logographical" text: an attempt to secure the proximity of logos to vitality. That phantasm of a primordial unity continues to haunt the dialectics of logos and zoon, writing and speech, human and animal</page><page sequence="6">M L N 791 being, even as the proximity of speech to its other the affective cry of the animal comes to establish the spaces and temporalities that regulate the opening of worlds-the human and animal worlds that form apart from one another. Worlds Apart: Philosophy and Animals Nature has presented itself as the Idea in the form of otherness. Since therefore the Idea is the negative of itself, or is external to itself; Nature is not merely external in relation to this Idea (and to its subjective exis- tence Spirit); the truth is rather that externality constitutes the specific character in which Nature, as Nature, exists. -Hegel15 Yet in the alert, warm animal there lies the pain and burden of an enormous sadness. For it too feels the presence of what often over- whelms us: a memory, as if the element we keep pressing toward was once more intimate, more true, and our communion infinitely tender. Here all is distance; there it was breath. After that first home, the second seems ambiguous and drafty. -Rilke16 Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) The work of Heidegger provides an appropriate place to begin an exploration of the philosophical world since it thematizes the idea of a world in danger. It also signals the place of philosophy's last and perhaps most vehement stand against the swelling tide of psychol- ogy and technology, two movements that contest the epistemologi- cal ground of the philosophical discourse throughout the nine- teenth century. Pressured by the existential crisis that the figure of the animal presents, Heidegger culminates the philosophical mo- mentum that brings metaphysics to a violent confrontation with the twentieth century. Following a discussion of philosophy and the animal in the Heideggerian and Nietzschean corpora, this explora- tion will recapitulate the philosophical tradition from Descartes to Hegel that leads to Heidegger's intervention. The key indices that return throughout this lineage involve the exclusion of the animal from the world established by language, the absence of death from the topos of the animal, and the indestructibility of the animal. Those three dimensions of animal being characterize the distance of the animal from the human world.</page><page sequence="7">792 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT Heidegger's writings display a curious preoccupation with the world-the absent world-of animals. For Heidegger as for the Western philosophical tradition that he sustains, language estab- lishes the gulf between mankind and the animal. Like the Aris- totelian animal that is capable of expressing only pleasure and pain, the animal in Heidegger's account is held to be incapable of devel- oping the greater faculty possessed by mankind for language. As a condition of being, language fundamentally expands the ontologi- cal dimension of a being's being, and this expansion forms the basis for a theory of world. The concept of world, which motivates much of Heidegger's writing, denies a place for the animal, unless this place can be defined as a space of exclusion. In Heidegger's thought the animal does not have world, or is poor in the world, incapable at any rate of a worldly existence. In his 1935 essay "The Origin of the Work of Art," in many ways a treatise on the world-forming activities of techne, Heidegger presents the contours of a world envisaged by the artwork: The world is not the mere collection of the countable or uncountable, familiar and unfamiliar things that are just there. But neither is it a merely imagined framework added by our representation to the sum of such given things. The world worlds, and is more fully in being than the tangible and perceptible realm in which we believe ourselves to be at home. World is never an object that stands before us and can be seen. World is the ever-nonobjective to which we are subject as long as the paths of birth and death, blessing and curse keep us transported into Being. Wherever those decisions of our history that relate to our very being are made, are taken up and abandoned by us, go unrecognized and are rediscovered by new inquiry, there the world worlds. A stone is worldless. Plant and animal likewise have no world; but they belong to the covert throng of a surrounding into which they are linked.17 Evidently, Heidegger's "world" is one that precedes such anthropo- centric notions as subjectivity, phenomenality, and consciousness: the "world worlds," for Heidegger, even in the absence of human consciousness. World makes possible those various modes of being, without being itself one of them. The "ever-nonobjective" world secures the ground for objects, entities, and various levels of con- scious and non-conscious existence. And yet human beings do "have" a world or are, at least, equipped with the capacity to have a world. Human beings possess the means- techne-with which to make the world appear: in artworks, for example. "A stone is worldless," however, and plants and animals also suffer</page><page sequence="8">M L N 793 this privation. As entities, stones, plants, and animals belong to the world, are in the world, but this world is not their own: it is another's world. Stones, plants, and animals exist in the world externally. For Heidegger, the abyss that separates mankind from other forms of being resides in the worldly power of language, which is to say, language and world are inseparable. Heidegger makes this relation clear: "[L]anguage alone brings what is, as something that is, into the Open for the first time. Where there is no language, as in the being of stone, plant, and animal, there is also no openness either of that which is not and of the empty."18 Where there is no language, there is no openness of being, non-being, nor absence of being. And this, in turn, is inseparable from the question of death. For world is also the place of Nothing, the space in which Nothing takes place. In the case of being, death signifies the presence of Nothing in the world. Heidegger strengthens the connection between world and the capacity for death in "The Thing" (1950): The mortals are human beings. They are called mortals because they can die. To die means to be capable of death as death. Only man dies. The animal perishes. It has death neither ahead of itself nor behind it. Death is the shrine of Nothing, that is, of that which in every respect is never something that merely exists, but which nevertheless presences, even as the mystery of Being itself.19 Without death, Heidegger argues-without the capacity to name the disappearance of being from the world-the world itself ceases to appear as the foundation that gives existence its place. Stressing the reciprocal and co-dependent momentum of this logic, Heideg- ger posits world within the faculty of language and mortality at the same time that he ascribes to world the task of preserving language and mortality (being's finitude). In Heidegger's words: "Mortals are they who can experience death as death. Animals cannot do so. But animals cannot speak either. The essential relation between language and death flashes up before us, but remains still unthought. "20 Ani- mals cannot experience death, the giving of being, of absolute singu- larity, to existence. And since they cannot die, conversely, animals cannot experience the death or loss of others. Unable to mourn a priori, the animal falls, according to Heidegger, beyond the existen- tial abodes of mankind-the very situation of its worldly being falls into doubt. Heidegger's attempts to delimit the boundaries that surround "world," Dasein, and the topology of the animal remain at best in-</page><page sequence="9">794 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT conclusive. In An Introduction to Metaphysics (1935), he makes this claim regarding "the darkening of the world [Entmachtung] ": "What do we mean by world when we speak of a darkening of the world? World is always world of the spirit. The animal has no world nor any environment ['Das Tier hat keine Welt, auch keine Umwelt']."21 The unequivocal tone of Heidegger's assertion is challenged by Derrida, who in Of Spirit offers a searching analysis of Heidegger's theses on the animal. Derrida finds that Heidegger in the Introduc- tion to Metaphysics has modified an earlier vision of the relations of three "essents" to world. He describes Heidegger's 1929-30 world- configuration: "The stone is without world (weltlos), the animal is poor in the world (weltarm), [and] Man is world-forming ... (weltbildend)."22 Establishing the apparent contradictions between this early view and Heidegger's later claims, Derrida highlights the difference between the animal's poverty in the earlier work and the absence of world in the later one. It is, he says, a difference between essence and degree. The distinction is crucial, for if indeed the animal's poverty of world marks a distinct existential condition (rather than the midpoint of a descending scale of privation that spans from mankind to stone), then the animal must be said to subside "within" some world, if not the world of man or of Dasein. Can poverty be construed as a mode of being? Moving toward that question, Derrida rejects the question of a degree of world from Heidegger's postulation: The difference he is talking about between poverty and wealth is not one of degree. For precisely because of a difference in essence, the world of the animal-and if the animal is poor in the world, and therefore in spirit, one must be able to talk about a world of the animal, and therefore of a spiritual world-is not a species or a degree of the human world. This poverty is not an indigence, a meagreness of world. It has, without doubt, the sense of privation (Entbehrung), of a lack: the animal does not have enough world, to be sure. But this lack is not to be evaluated as a quantitative relation to the entities of the world. It is not that the animal has a lesser relationship, a more limited access to entities, it has an other relationship.23 The idea of an "other relationship" provides a crucial glimpse into the possibility of an animal world. Positing another way of relating the human and animal worlds, Derrida moves the question of animal world from one of its existence (does the animal have world?) to that of the relationship by which mankind might discover the animal world (can we speak of an animal world?). This, in turn,</page><page sequence="10">M L N 795 calls into question the use of language as a universal mode of deter- mining being's relation to world. (Elsewhere, for example, Derrida poses the following questions of the animal's relation to world and to Dasein: "[D]oes the animal hear the call that originates respon- sibility? Does it question? Moreover, can the call heard by Dasein come originally to or from the animal? Is there an advent of the animal?")24 In Derrida's critique of Heidegger, the poverty of ani- mal being presupposes, nonetheless, some mode of having, even as it drifts toward a not-having: "[the animal] is deprived of world because it can have a world."25 Accordingly, animals are neither reticent inhabitants of the human world, nor are they, like stones, impassive to the environment of entities. Rather, the animal in- habits, even if in a negative manner, a world that is at the same time not a world. While this notion of poverty seems to summon a philo- sophical paradox, Derrida is hesitant to concede this aporia in Heidegger's formulation, arguing that in Heidegger "The animal has and does not have a world."26 The ambiguity that Derrida describes in Heidegger's animal world, the duplicity of a (simultaneous) having and not-having, fol- lows from the inability of the animal to reflect upon the entities that surround it. The animal is enveloped in a "world," or environment of entities, it can perceive or sense those entities (tactilely, for exam- ple), but cannot appropriate them "as such"-that is as conceptual or ideal entities. "The animal can have a world because it has access to entities, but it is deprived of a world because it does not have access to entities as such and in their Being."27 In other words, the animal cannot interiorize the world through reflection: unreflected, the world remains exterior to its being. Herder insists upon this very point in his investigation of the origin of language: one cannot derive by any means the world of human language from the cries of animals. According to Herder, the faculty of reflection, which forms the foundation of language, comes complete in human beings and distinguishes logos essentially from the "dark language of even all animals." Prefiguring the structural difference that Heidegger in- scribes between the world-forming habits of mankind and the worldly destitution of the animal, Herder asserts that "the human species stands above the animals not by stages of more or of less but in kind."28 At the same time, since Heideggerian world is essentially one of Dasein, the animal's having a "world" suggests in some sense its capacity to exist in the world, inside the world, and in the world of expression, though the poverty of this expression must be illus-</page><page sequence="11">796 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT trated by summoning a hypothetical language under erasure. He marks the animal world as a world under erasure. In Heidegger's technique of "crossing through," the animal world is represented by words that are at once written and erased. Thus, a lizard lying on a rock sees that rock as "rock," crossed through in order to signify the lizard's inability to access this rock "as entity." Derrida explains the techne: "Erasure of the name, then, here of the name of the rock which would designate the possibility of naming the rock itself, as such and accessible in its being-rock. The erasing would mark in our language, by avoiding a word, this inability of the animal to name."29 According to Derrida, the erasure signifies, "in our language," the absence of the lizard world. And yet, the lizard is not in total deprivation (the rock "is doubtless given him in some way," claims Heidegger): it lacks only the ability to open itself to the as such of the thing. It is not of the rock as such that the lizard has experience. This is why the name of the rock must be erased when we want to designate what the lizard is stretched out upon . . . This inability to name is not primarily or simply linguistic; it derives from the properly phenomenological impossibility of speaking the phenomenon whose phenomenality as such, or whose very as such, does not appear to the animal and does not unveil the Being of the entity.30 The animal "world" is thus, despite its qualification, undeniably a world, albeit a world apart: "however little we can identify with the lizard, we know that it has a relationship with the sun-and with the stone, which itself has none, neither with the sun nor with the lizard."31 Elsewhere, Derrida recounts Heidegger's complex delin- eation of the animal "world": The Heideggerian discourse on the animal is violent and awkward, at times contradictory. Heidegger does not simply say "The animal is poor in the world [weltarm]," for, as distinct from the stone, it has a world. He says: the animal has a world in the mode of a not-having. But this not- having does not constitute in his view an indigence, the lack of a world that would be human. So why this negative determination? Where does it come from? There is no category of original existence for the animal: it is evidently not Dasein, either as vorhandene or zuhandene (Being cannot appear, be, or be questioned as such [als] for the animal).32 Animals are not entirely excluded from Heidegger's world, but they are put at a distance from the openness of being: "the animal has a world in the mode of not-having." Unwilling to relinquish the animal entirely from the topoi of being, Heidegger sets the animal forth,</page><page sequence="12">M L N 797 instead, into the recesses of worldly poverty: the animal is "poor in world," it exists without the plenitude of world and perishes without dying-without loss. Heidegger's most conciliatory and lucid efforts to correlate the domains of mortal and animal worlds appear in his 1926 explora- tion of poetic destitution, "What Are Poets For?" In this reading of H6lderlin and Rilke, Heidegger offers the world to human beings, beasts, and plants alike, reserving only the "world's night," or the possibility of a worldly absence, for human "mortals." Heidegger swiftly links, in the space of his analysis, the destitution of the "pres- ent" with the failure of mortals to experience death: The time remains destitute not only because God is dead, but because mortals are hardly aware and capable of even their own mortality. Mor- tals have not yet come into ownership of their own nature. Death with- draws into the enigmatic. The mystery of pain remains veiled. Love has not yet been learned. But the mortals are. They are, in that there is language.33 Under the sway, perhaps, of the poetic "spirit," Heidegger departs from his usual sobriety and pursues instead the trajectory of mortal- ity through to its convergence with love. Tracing the logic of this rhetorical overflow, one infers that in language mortals discover or recover being. Mortals "are" because language "is there" (Dasein), because language takes place. Love constitutes, furthermore, a les- son to be learned, a knowledge or experience to be acquired which would, if mastered, lift the veil of pain's mystery. Not simply a pain among pains, however, the pain of which Heidegger speaks claims as its source the enigmatic abyss or "world's night" of death. Death is the place in which being arrives unto itself, becomes itself by fusing with nature: world, the world of Dasein, is formed in the alliance of interiority and exteriority, of nature and love, of mankind as mortal and mankind as animal. The alliance, however, is never given: it must be achieved by "venturing" forth, by risking. In having world, one is never far from the destitution of its withdrawal: and the awareness of that finitude, according to Heidegger, constitutes the risk that gives mankind its mortality, indeed its capacity to love. Following Rilke, who names the ground shared by all living crea- tures "the Open," Heidegger grants to animals and plants the same "daring" that necessitates mankind's existence. In Rilke's poem, all creatures are exposed to the "unprotectedness" of the Open, or as Heidegger quotes it: "As Nature gives the other creatures over to the</page><page sequence="13">798 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT venture of their dim delight and in our soil and branchwork grants none special cover, so too our being's pristine ground settles our plight; we are no dearer to it; it ventures us."34 Heidegger concedes, in Rilke's world-structure, the existence of a community of living beings. And to the extent that those beings are in the world, they are susceptible to death: "Plant, animal, and man-insofar as they are beings at all, that is, insofar as they are ventured-agree in this, that they are not specially protected. But since they differ nonetheless in their being, there will also be a difference in their unprotected- ness."35 This difference finds expression in Rilke's next lines: "Ex- cept that we, more eager than plant and beast, go with this venture, will it, adventurous more sometimes than Life itself is, more daring by a breath .. ."36 Mankind exposes itself further, beyond even "Life itself," to the dangers that await all living creatures in the Open. Mankind alone wills the danger, risks its whole life for the sake of being, living more so than plants and animals, "unshielded in the world." Finding confirmation elsewhere in Rilke's work, Heidegger argues that mankind's unshieldedness actually stands it "before the world": Plant and animal are admitted into the Open. They are "in the world." The "in" means: they are included and drawn, unlightened, into the drawing of the pure draft. The relation to the Open-if indeed we may still speak here of a "to"-is the unconscious one of a merely striving- drawing ramification into the whole of what is. With the heightening of consciousness, the nature of which, for modern metaphysics, is represen- tation, the standing and the counterstanding of objects are also height- ened. The higher its consciousness, the more the conscious being is excluded from the world. This is why man, in the words of Rilke's letter; is "before the world. "He is not admitted into the Open. Man stands over against the world.37 Heidegger has, it would appear, reversed his position on the animal, being, and world under the influence of Rilke, or poetry, or both. Now, plants and animals are in the world, and it is rather mankind that stands "before the world," "not admitted into the Open," "over against the world." And yet before rushing to confirm this reversal, one must further situate the evolution of Heidegger's thought. In Heidegger's articulation of mankind's venture into the world, the latter stands before mankind as a world to come. The fullest manifestation of Heidegger's world is none other than the future: to have world is to have a future. Thus standing before the world, over against the world, mankind stands in the world. The world is essen- tially a world to come, and mankind stands in it even while being</page><page sequence="14">M L N 799 denied the Open. Plants and beasts, however, who stand in the world, remain nonetheless outside of the world's "presence" (as future) as well as outside of and behind the present. Plant and beast remain secure in the world while possessing neither hope nor de- sire: Plant and beast, "in the venture of their dim delight," are held carefree in the Open. Their bodily character does not perplex them. By their drives, the living creatures are lulled into the Open. They too remain in danger to be sure, but not in their nature. Plant and beast lie in the balance in such a way that the balance always settles into the repose of a secureness. The balance in which plant and beast are ventured does not yet reach into the realm of what is in essence and thus constantly unstilled.38 The security that surrounds plant and beast in the world, comes from their inability to reflect the world "as such." While providing security, that inability denies plants and animals access to the future. Animals, who, according to Aristotle, "live by appearances and mem- ories, and have but little of connected experience," cannot bring together the "invisible of the world's inner space"39 with the world of objects (the outer world of objects and their representations, or language) to form the experience of being that Heidegger values: "What has merely passed away is without destiny even before it has passed. The once-present being, on the contrary, partakes in des- tiny."40 Heidegger differentiates the non-present being of animals and plants from the "once-present being" of mortals in the capacity for self-representation. "It is by the positioning [pro-positing] that belongs to representation that Nature is brought before man ... Plant and animal do not will because, muted in their desire, they never bring the Open before themselves as an object. They cannot go with the venture as one that is represented."41 In this sense, representation establishes the capacity for "connected experience," the ability to bring willing and appearance together into the world -as world and future. Thus mankind, according to Heidegger, stands within the dimension of connected experience and before the world as the always "once-present being," while the animal, de- nied the means of a historical and world-forming techne-language- remains "without destiny even before it has passed." In the world, but unable to risk the venture of its loss, the animal turns its back to the future of the world. In sum, without language, the animal re- mains in the memories of a merely passed world: undying, unde- stined, and unmourned. In "The Eighth Elegy," Rilke projects this</page><page sequence="15">800 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT animal world: "We know what is really out there only from the animal's gaze; for we take the very young child and force it around, so that it sees objects-not the Open which is so deep in animals' faces. Free from death. We, only, can see death; the free animal has its decline in back of it, forever .. ."42 Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) Most of those who have written about the origin of language... looked for [it] in the superior articulation of the organs of speech. As if an orangutan with precisely the same organs had invented a language. -Herder43 If a lion could talk, we could not understand him. -Wittgenstein44 While the chasm that separates an impoverished animality from the world-forming surge of Dasein is found to be unbridgeable in Heidegger, one discovers in Nietzsche a more sympathetic relation to the worldly differences and distances that the animal discloses. In contrast to the Heideggerian animal, Nietzsche's creatures display, for the most part, a joyous, even ecstatic, disposition. Of the ani- mal's joyous nature, Nietzsche writes: "A human being may well ask an animal: 'Why do you not speak to me of your happiness but only stand and gaze at me?' And the animal would like to answer, and say: 'The reason is I always forget what I was going to say'-but then he forgot this answer too, and stayed silent: so that the human being was left wondering."45 Here, the animal has language but lacks memory: it is constantly forgetting to speak.46 For Nietzsche, the forgetting that animals do marks their impermanent relation to language: animals are not bound by language, they maintain a cor- dial but indifferent relation to its demands.47 The implications of an essential forgetting-of an existence based upon the capacity to forget-are far-reaching. Unable to wield the apparatus of memory, animal being elaborates an entirely different relation to world, his- tory, and language from that of mankind: Then man says "I remember" and envies the animal which immediately forgets and sees each moment really die, sink back into deep night extin- guished forever. In this way the animal lives unhistorically: for it goes into the present like a number without leaving a fraction; it does not know how to dissimulate, hides nothing, appears at every moment fully as what it is and so cannot but be honest.48</page><page sequence="16">M L N 801 The animal's instinctive honesty (glossed above by Derrida as its inability to keep secrets) also prevents the animal from establishing an awareness of the death that overtakes beings. Without memory, without history, death loses the singularity of its finitude: for the animal there can no longer be death, only deaths. As Nietzsche indicates, in the animal world it is not the being that dies, but rather the moment that dies, passes, sinks "back into deep night extin- guished forever." Unlike human beings, who believe themselves to occupy unique moments in time, to be bound by singularity, the Nietzschean animal appears rather to be inhabited by singular mo- ments: as each moment dies and sinks back into oblivion, the animal passes into another moment, another world, another history. In this fashion the animal survives time which is essentially human. Accord- ingly, the animal returns to each new world as an immortal, incapa- ble of only dying once. It is, perhaps, with this aspect of animal immortality that Nietzsche identifies when he writes in Ecce Homo: "One pays dearly for immortality: one has to die several times while still alive."49 Nietzsche repeatedly turns his philosophy toward this strenuous fatality of animals. Even Heidegger, his adamant denial of the animal world or full animal world notwithstanding, appears to concede a privileged in- teraction between the Dionysiac philosopher and his animals. In his lectures on Nietzsche under the heading "Zarathustra's Ani- mals," Heidegger observes: "The animals [do] talk to Zarathustra." Heidegger sanctions this exchange by allowing for a sensuous ex- pression on the part of the animals, an emblematic signing. He writes: Zarathustra's animals are all the more implacable inasmuch as we hear them-not expressing certain propositions or rules or admonitions- but saying from out of their essential natures what is essential, and saying it with growing lucidity through the palpable presence of sensuous imag- ery. Sense-images speak only to those who possess the constructive en- ergy to give them shape, so that they make sense. As soon as the poetic force-that is, the higher constructive energy-wanes, the emblems turn mute. They petrify, become sheer "facade" and "ornament."50 Surprisingly, Heidegger grants to Zarathustra and his animals a world that frames their interaction. The "constructive energy," while operative, allows the two worlds, if indeed they are two separate worlds and not two dimensions of the same world, to intersect. Furthermore, in Heidegger's account, the energy or "poetic force"</page><page sequence="17">802 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT that forges a passage between the human and animal worlds also creates a time for dialogue. In this sense, the poetic force is also a temporal force: it founds a temporality. As time passes, the energy wanes and the animals return to their former, emblematic mute- ness. During the time of the poetic force, however, what is invariably transmitted between the species remains on the highest order of the essential, in this case the eternal return: "Zarathustra's animals speak to him about what they themselves symbolize: they speak of eternal return."51 Zarathustra's animal transgression carries, how- ever, a price. The effect of the exchange is, according to Heidegger, a profound solitude: "when Zarathustra's loneliness speaks, it is his animals who are speaking."52 (Another figure marked by loneliness, Orpheus, also spoke to the animals in their language, and also sought to cross the barriers that enclose humanity and its finite temporality.) In this sense, the voices of Zarathustra's eagle and serpent signal an impossible communion and bring Zarathustra closer to the abyss of a collapsing subjectivity. Heidegger adds: These two animals define for the first time the loneliest loneliness, and it is something different from what the usual view takes it to be. In the usual view, solitude is what liberates us, frees us from all things. Solitude, according to this view, is what happens after you post the "Do Not Dis- turb" sign. Yet in our loneliest loneliness the most hair-raising and haz- ardous things are loosed upon us and on our task, and these cannot be deflected onto other things or other people.53 In conversing with the animals, Zarathustra exposes himself to the contagion of their worldly poverty: here, speaking with animals seems to effect a becoming-animal. By speaking with animals, one opens oneself to the vast negativity of a world under erasure; one renounces the "presence" of a world determined by language. Zara- thustra's other-worldly intercourse with animals thus exceeds the parameters of language, blocking its ability to be represented in the human world. His dialogue takes place outside the exchanges that constitute the world community, in the interstices of communica- tion. Indeed, as Heidegger notes, it is in the suspended moment of Nietzsche's "midday" that the encounters occur: "These animals of his, eagle and serpent, ... do not enter on the stage at some fortu- itous point. Zarathustra first espies them at glowing midday, that part of the day which throughout the work Thus Spoke Zarathustra unleashes an essential image-generating force."54 In suspended time and solitude, conversing here comes to resemble its antithesis,</page><page sequence="18">M L N 803 seclusion and stasis. Conversation requires chronology, the move- ment of the sun. Moreover, the solitude that Zarathustra achieves with animals is not to be confused with any familiar (or, for that matter, familial) comfort: it is, for Heidegger, a solitude emerging from the depths of alienation: [The animals] seek to learn whether Zarathustra is still living, living as one who is prepared to go under. That should be enough to let us know that the eagle and serpent are not pets; we do not take them home with us and domesticate them. They are alien to all that is domestic and usual, all that is "familiar" in the petty sense of the word.55 Like Poe's orangutan, Zarathustra's animals do not belong at home, in homes-they are unheimlich. And so the "speech" of animals is uncanny because, even if it is only 'jabbering," it manages to pro- duce in Zarathustra the semblance of a world, of a full exteriority within which language circulates. Heidegger explains that "after such solitude the world is like a garden, even when it is invoked by mere empty talk, in the sheer play of words and phrases."56 The discourse of animals thus provokes a deep sense of solitude, an abundance of emptiness. It is in this sense that those animals are uncanny: Zarathustra feels alone in their company. For Heidegger, Zarathustra's exchange with the animals portrays the "loneliest loneliness," an experience of solitude that reveals, for an instant (the shadowless moment of a suspended midday), the animal world. Zarathustra's intercourse with the animals propels him into an- other world, another time: the transgressive communion aligns Zarathustra with an alternative world-history, a prehistory of world that explodes into his memory. In On the Genealogy of Morals, Nietz- sche writes: "indeed perhaps there was nothing more fearful and uncanny in the whole prehistory of man than his mnemotechnics."57 The fear and pain that accompany Zarathustra's entry into the abyss of animal world arise from the depths of memory, or as Nietzsche phrases it, from the "prehistory of man." By engaging the animals, Zarathustra-and by inference, mankind-plummets from the edi- fice of world (language and memory) into the immemorial open of a time before world. And this time before world, this prehistory of man, returns to mankind as the figure of the animal. Animal being forces mankind to acknowledge the finitude of world: that is, ani- mals tear mankind away from the imagined totality of world. In this way, Nietzschean and Heideggerian animal meet at a point beyond language, world, and memory-at a point beyond mortality. The</page><page sequence="19">804 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT point beyond world is marked for Nietzsche by forgetting, for Heidegger by erasure; and for both Nietzsche and Heidegger, the beyond is recalled by the figure of the animal. For Nietzsche, how- ever, the world beyond represents a "robust health," and the possi- bility of a new beginning, a "new promise," while for Heidegger it is a saddened and darkened affair.58 The critical distinction between Nietzsche's unheimlich company and Heidegger's "crossed-through" world may indeed be one of affect. In an interview with Jean-Luc Nancy, Derrida notes the importance of affect to animal being. On the seeming melancholy of Heidegger's animals, Derrida responds to the following question: J-LN:.. . How could sadness be nonhuman? Or rather, how would sadness fail to testify to a relation to a world? JD:... To come back to your remark, perhaps the animal is sad, per- haps it appears sad, because it indeed has a world, in the sense in which Heidegger speaks of a world as world of spirit, and because there is an openness of this world for it, but an openness without openness, a having (world) without having it. Whence the impression of sadness-for man or in relation to man, in the society of man. And of a sadness determined in its phenomenology, as if the animal remained a man enshrouded, suffering, deprived on account of having access neither to the world of man that he nonetheless senses, nor to truth, speech, death, or the Being of the being as such.59 The contrast in mood between the Nietzschean and Heideggerian animal, between ecstasy and depression respectively, brings the question of animal being to the limits of language-to its border with affect and the affective cry. This limit that speaks to "the Being of the being as such" also marks the final line of a philosophical tradition that situates the distance of the animal in absolute terms. What follows is a brief survey of that lineage. Organized according to thematic rather than historical concerns, the remainder of this investigation is meant to serve as a kind zoological garden, a series of exhibits that reveal the figure of the animal in the philosophical landscape. The function of the series is to indicate the frequency with which the animal figure appears at critical junctures, not to account for the totality of its meaning. By tracking the animal across the philosophical spectrum, one discovers the systemic manner in which the figure of the animal comes to portray a kind of serial logic: the animal is incapable of language; that lack prevents the</page><page sequence="20">M L N 805 animal from experiencing death; this in turn suspends the animal in a virtual, perpetual existence. The figure of the animal thus de- termines a radically antithetical counterpoint to human mortality, to the edifice of humanism. Rene Descartes (1596-1650) Perhaps the most notorious of the dualist thinkers, Descartes has come to stand for the insistent segregation of the human and ani- mal worlds in philosophy. Likening animals to automata, Descartes argues in his 1637 Discourse on the Method that not only "do the beasts have less reason than men, but they have no reason at all."60 Al- though he concedes in private that the animal possesses not only an "dme organique ou vegetale" but also an "time sensible," Descartes warns that one should not "think, like some of the ancients that the beasts speak, although we do not understand their language. For if that were true, then since they have many organs that correspond to ours, they could make themselves understood by us as well as by their fellows."61 Since animals are endowed with the capacity for movement, Descartes continues, they are in this regard like human beings and machines. Unable to engage in genuine speech, how- ever, animals remain, along with machines, simple mimics. "[W]e must not confuse," Descartes writes, "speech with the natural move- ments which express passions and which can be imitated by ma- chines as well as by animals."62 It is Descartes who most deeply instilled in the philosophical tradition the idea that the capacity for reason and consciousness determines the ontological universe. As the greatest vehicle for such reflection, human beings occupy the center of the universe that they themselves have conjured. Across the Cartesian plane of being, only human beings establish an au- thentic site: all other beings reflect the eidos of mankind's produc- tions. In this schema, animals, like automata, simply reflect the priority of mankind's "presence," its cogito. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) Challenging the Cartesian view of animals, Leibniz approaches the question of animal being from the perspective of monadic compo- sition. Animals, or "divine machines," are incapable of death but</page><page sequence="21">806 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT only because the monads that compose them are reorganized into new beings rather than extinguished at the end of life. To this extent they resemble souls which are likewise immortal. Leibniz explains: Thus, not only souls, but also animals cannot be generated and cannot perish. They are only unfolded, enfolded, reclothed, unclothed, and transformed; souls never entirely leave their body, and do not pass from one body into another that is entirely new to them. There is therefore no metempsychosis, but there is metamorphosis. Animals change, but they ac- quire and leave behind only parts. In nutrition this happens a little at a time and by small insensible particles, though continually, but it happens suddenly, visibly, but rarely, in conception or in death, which causes animals to acquire or lose a great deal all at once.63 Leibniz has here linked conception with death. By attaching the question of appearance to being, Leibniz extends the rift between human and animal existence to include the limits of appearance as well as disappearance, the finitude of beginning as well as ending. In the anonymously published "New System of Nature" (1695), Leibniz aligns his theory of the "conservation" of animal matter with those of classical naturalists Democritus and Hippocrates. Claiming to follow in their paths, Leibniz asserts that it is "natural that an animal, having always been alive and organized. . . always remains so," and that "animals are not born and do not die ... [the] things we believe to begin and perish merely appear and disappear."64 According to Leibniz's physics, what he calls in 1714 the "Monadology," only the souls of rational creatures are prone to creation and destruction while the souls and bodies of "brutes" form a limitless continuum, an expanse of life and matter that nei- ther begins nor ends, but rather transforms itself into further mate- rial figurations. Thus Nancy writes in The Inoperative Community: "Since Leibniz there has been no death in our universe: in one way or another an absolute circulation of meaning (of values, of ends, of History) fills or reabsorbs all finite negativity, draws from each finite singular destiny a surplus value of humanity or an infinite super- humanity."65 Despite his departure from the rigid metaphysics of Descartes, and despite the radical contributions he brings to the philosophies of composition and formation, Leibniz nonetheless reinscribes the dis- tinction between "beasts" and "rational animals." Leibniz locates the gulf between two modes of cognition, "perception" and "appercep- tion," arguing: "it is good to distinguish between perception, which is</page><page sequence="22">M L N 807 the internal state of the monad representing external things, and apperception, which is consciousness, or the reflective knowledge of the internal state, something not given to all souls, nor at all times to a given soul."66 Thus while all animals and souls are imperishable, only "rational animals" are equipped with the apperceptive faculties that are required to experience or anticipate death. In Leibniz's dis- course, death comes to assume the properties of "necessary or eter- nal truths, such as those of logic, numbers, and geometry, which bring about an indubitable connection of ideas and infallible con- sequences."67 And because the "interconnection" of perceptions in animals is founded "in the memory of facts or effects, and not at all in the knowledge of causes," Leibniz writes that animals "do not fully perish in what we call death."68 According to Leibniz, death re- quires a certain calculation toward finitude, toward "infallible conse- quences," and without such reflective faculties animals remain in the world undying. Animals, like souls, are those creatures thus destined to survive, or at least to remain: their apparent lack of logos commits them to a perpetual and protean "evolution" toward eternity. Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) Leibniz's belief in the perpetuation of being over existing monadic compositions returns much later in Schopenhauer's articulation of "palingenesis," or the survival of the will. Like Leibniz, Schopen- hauer insists that while "[c]onsciousness is destroyed in death, to be sure . . .that which has been producing it is by no means de- stroyed."69 Schopenhauer, a key figure in the advent of evolutionary theory, argues that consciousness is in fact a mere component of corporeality and has little bearing on what is essential in being. Consciousness is, he writes, "something secondary, as a result of the life-process, it is also secondary psychologically, in antithesis to will, which alone is primary and everywhere the original element."70 Leaning increasingly close to Lamarck's preliminary evolutionism -in which interior orthogenetic forces "will" the organism to adapt-Schopenhauer claims that consciousness, which is in truth a consciousness of life and whose sole content is the desire to remain alive, is shared by all living creatures. Consciousness is thus an effect of being alive rather than of being. "That which cries 'I, I, I want to exist' is not you alone; it is everything, absolutely everything that has the slightest trace of consciousness. So that this desire in you is</page><page sequence="23">808 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT precisely that which is not individual but common to everything without exception."71 Regarding the loss of consciousness in death, Schopenhauer writes that what dies in death (consciousness) is common but what survives is "the being's intrinsic state": But cheer up!-for what kind of consciousness is it? A cerebral, an ani- mal, a somewhat more highly charged bestial consciousness, in as far as we have it in all essentials in common with the whole animal world, even if it does reach its peak in us. This consciousness is, in its origin and aim, merely an expedient for helping the animal to get what it needs. The state to which death restores us on the other hand, is our original state, i.e. is the being's intrinsic state, the moving principle of which appears in the production and maintenance of the life which is now coming to an end: it is the state of the thing in itself, in antithesis to the world of appearance.72 All consciousness is animal consciousness, according to Schopen- hauer, and disappears in death. In death, however, the individual is born: death separates intrinsic being from animal being. Schopen- hauer's description of the transcendence of the individual in death to an authentic state of being connects this somewhat morbid phi- losophy to the doctrines already observed. Still, it is important to note that Schopenhauer concedes a form of consciousness to "the whole animal world." What distinguishes mankind from the animal then is not the abil- ity to be conscious, but rather, once again, the ability to perish, to be unconscious. For Schopenhauer, the unconsciousness effected by death, or put more precisely the "cognitionless primal state," restores being to its originary state as "will." Furthermore, the metaphysical will defies "the world of appearance," its representation as phenom- enon or consciousness.73 "One can thus regard every human be- ing," writes Schopenhauer, "from two opposed viewpoints. From the one he is the fleeting individual, burdened with error and sorrow and with a beginning and end in time; from the other he is the indestructible primal being which is objectified in everything that exists."74 The distinction is important. The fleeting individual, marked by finitude in space and time, takes place in the world while the "indestructible primal being," although "objectified in every- thing that exists," cannot be objectified "as such." While maintain- ing the metaphysical structure, Schopenhauer here reverses the terms of the opposition between mankind and nature by granting animals a measure of consciousness and individuality. In Schopen- hauer's world only the individual can signify, that is, appear in the</page><page sequence="24">M L N 809 phenomenal world. The individual, however, does not signify indi- viduality but commonality. Individuality in Schopenhauer's dis- course is derived from the generality of life, of living beings, and does not accord any direct access to the "primal state." Thus what the individual consciousness signifies is essentially common. Like his description of a consciousness that is "common to everything," Schopenhauer consigns individuality to a secondary and derivative category which is superseded by a transcendental and unrepresent- able singularity, the will. Therefore, animals, which are constituted primarily by the multitude, as hordes, are purely phenomenal- capable of individuated appearances but unable to participate in the transcendental specificity that comes from willing. In sum, im- mortality does not necessarily mean perpetual being: "[I]mmor- tality can also be termed an indestructibility without continued exis- tence."75 Schopenhauer's opposition between indestructibility and exis- tence leads invariably toward evolutionary thought, as well to a zoo- morphic rendering of Dasein. It is in the work of Rousseau, however, that the question of the animal's capacity to represent is raised. Ultimately, one must question whether the phenomenality of the animal-its cry-in fact points philosophy to the existence of an- other world. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78) Rousseau, like Descartes and Leibniz before him, also likens animals to automata, or "ingenious machines." He does, however, concede that animals possess intelligence, or at least that they have ideas: "Every animal has ideas," he writes, "since it has senses."76 Sensing, in Rousseau, achieves the status of intelligence since it comes from the source of all Reason, Nature. What truly distinguishes mankind from animal, according to Rousseau, lies in the "faculty of self- perfection, a faculty which, with the aid of circumstances, suc- cessively develops all the others, and resides among us as much in the species as in the individual."77 What the animal lacks, according to Rousseau, is not intelligence but imagination, which is to say, language. Imagination and language are linked, for Rousseau, in the capacity to perfect oneself. Efforts toward self-perfection, in turn, force one to consider finitude and thus death. Addressing the conception of death, Rousseau repeats the familiar axiom that the animal does not fear death because it cannot imagine death, "be-</page><page sequence="25">810 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT cause an animal will never know what it is to die."78 Rousseau con- cludes that the "knowledge of death and its terrors is one of the first acquisitions that man has made in withdrawing from the animal condition."79 The inability of the animal to proceed toward death results from its inability to imagine and fear death which, in turn, limits its capacity to perfect itself. What Rousseau has added to the human reason/animal instinct dialectic is a supplementary capacity for imagination. Derrida addresses Rousseau's supplement to rea- son in Of Grammatology, observing that Although the concept of reason is very complex in Rousseau, it may be said that, in certain regards, reason, in as much as it is the understanding and the faculty of forming ideas, is less proper to humanity than imagina- tion and perfectibility. We have already noticed in what sense reason may be called natural. One may also remark that from another point of view animals, although gifted with intelligence, are not perfectible. They are deprived of imagination, of that power of anticipation that exceeds the givens of the senses and takes us toward the unperceived.80 Animals are deprived of futures. Thus, in Rousseau's contribution to the thought of animal being, the animal is confined to a perpet- ual presence that never advances in being or time since the animal can never anticipate the arrival of what is unperceived, or unim- agined. And so Derrida concludes that Rousseau's intervention in the field of animal philosophy produces a link between the powers of imagination-the ability to produce images or representations- and mortality: If one moves along the course of the supplementary series, he sees that imagination belongs to the same chain of significations as the anticipa- tion of death. Imagination is at bottom the relationship with death. The image is death. A proposition that one may define or make indefinite thus: the image is a death or (the) death is an image. Imagination is the power that allows life to affect itself with its own re-presentation.81 According to Derrida, Rousseau positions the essence of death in the imagination, in the image. Only beings that imagine can die. Rousseau's theses on language are also related to the faculty of imagination and illuminate further the question of animal being. Seeking to recreate the stages that led to the invention of lan- guage, Rousseau devolves mankind to a state alongside that of ani- mals. In that condition, Rousseau reasons, mankind only expressed itself, like animals, affectively. "Man's first language," speculates</page><page sequence="26">MLN 811 Rousseau, "the most universal, the most energetic and the only language he needed before it was necessary to persuade men assem- bled together, is the cry of nature."82 The cry of nature, according to Rousseau, is a kind of primordial, natural articulation that is available to all animals and precedes discourse. From this sponta- neous eruption, which issues from "a kind of instinct in pressing circumstances, to beg for help in great dangers, or for relief of violent ills," man begins to form societies from smaller communities and subsequently acquires a more "extensive language" through "multiplied vocal inflections ... combined with gestures .. ."83 What seems to be at work in Rousseau's account is a mimetic theory of language culled from the plenitude of an unspeakable but total natural language. In other words language, according to Rousseau, exists in nature and is derived by mankind through mimesis, through imagination. In this scenario mankind, and not the animal, emerges as the mimic. And mankind's language, its technical language, as Derrida has shown, enters into the world as a supplement to the "voice" of Nature. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) Also invoking mankind's first gesture toward language, Kant arrives at the mimetic structure which opposes, like Rousseau's, the Carte- sian sequence. In a footnote to his "Conjectural Beginning of Hu- man History," Kant designates a primary utterance in the phone of animals. The animal cry is subsequently mimicked by man. Kant speculates: "While as yet alone, man must have been moved by the urge for communication to make his existence known to other liv- ing beings, particularly to such as utter sounds. These sounds he could imitate, and they could later serve as names."84 Here, the animal possesses a primordial capacity from which naming arises; it is a proto-nominative capacity that allows one to make one's "exis- tence known to other living beings." Kant's "conjectural beginning" posits, in fact, an a priori ontology into which man is thrust as an existential after-thought or effect. Nature, according to Kant, exists first but the existence of man cannot be derived from that origin. Indeed, just prior to the footnote, Kant claims of the conjectural enterprise: "Unless one is to indulge in irresponsible conjectures, one must start out with something which human reason cannot derive from prior natural causes-in the present case, the existence</page><page sequence="27">812 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT of man."85 Accordingly, it would appear that it is mankind that does not inhabit the natural world and that only in imitation can man- kind determine the world to which it improperly belongs.86 Man- kind enters the world through mimesis. Kant alludes here, of course, to the sequence of events as related in "Genesis": "God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name." Hegel also reads the "Genetic" appropriation of animals by man- kind and language as an essential act in the constitution mankind's dialectical existence. For Hegel, the named animal is sublated into the recesses of human ideation and language. He writes: In the name its [the animal's] empirical being is removed from it, that is, it is no longer concrete, no longer a multiplicity in itself, no longer a living entity. Instead it is transformed into a pure and simple ideal. Adam's first mediating action in establishing his dominion over the ani- mals consisted in his granting them names; thus he denied them as independent beings and he transformed them into ideals.87 According to Hegel, the act of naming transforms animals from independent beings into idealized beings: language, in essence, nul- lifies animal life. In disappearing, the animal leaves only its cry. The Animal Cry: Edmund Burke (1729-1797) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) Derrida's description of the animal cry as a moment of phenomenal appearance or articulation that simultaneously pierces the world of language and the other, alien topology of the animal can be traced to the ceuvres of Burke and Hegel. The idea of the animal cry is related to the question of death. As discussed earlier, Schopenhauer holds that in death the individual takes leave of its animal existence and passes into the transcendental, para-phenomenal realm of in- trinsic being, or will. The animal thus exists in one temporality while being inhabits another: "Death announces itself frankly as the end of the individual, but in this individual lies the germ of a new being. Thus nothing that dies dies for ever .. The contrivance which presents us from perceiving this is time."88 Schopenhauer implies that being consists of two temporal dimensions whose connection, palingenesis, cannot be secured in the phenomenality of either space or time.</page><page sequence="28">M LN 813 The animal cry marks or signals the moment of contact between those two ontic worlds: the cry is, as Derrida explains, a signal burdened with the anti-discursive force of animality and madness. Burke's 1757 reflection on the sublime includes a section on "The Cries of Animals." For Burke, the experience of the sublime aroused by the animal's cry imposes a moment wholly outside of time-an extemporaneous moment-in which the dynamics of reason are tem- porarily halted. According to Burke, this moment is registered by "astonishment," the limit response to the sublime in nature. "Aston- ishment," Burke writes, "is that state of the soul, in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror."89 In this state, Burke argues, human reasoning succumbs to and lags behind "the great power of the sublime," which "anticipates our reasonings, and hurries us on by an irresistible force."90 What is most astonishing, however, is Burke's assertion that "[s]uch sounds as imitate the natural inarticulate voices of men, or any animals in pain or danger, are capable of conveying great ideas."91 This suggests that the sub- lime experience constitutes an idea, and that the cries of animals are, to some degree, its facilitators. In fact, according to Burke, this "great idea" approximates a glimpse into the very essence of an idea-generating affect. It is a power denied to language, as Burke explains: It might seem that these modulations of sound carry some connection with the nature of the things they represent, and are not merely arbi- trary; because the natural cries of all animals, even of those animals with whom we have not been acquainted, never fail to make themselves suffi- ciently understood; this cannot be said of language.92 It thus appears that the inarticulate cries of animals convey-with urgency (the sublime temporicity always calls for an emergency) -the sudden realization of a primary relation between the noise and its referent. This referent, however, is not something that is already known to the listener; rather, its existence is made manifest to the subject for the first time as a sublime incarnation. And because of its prematurity (with regard to the rational faculties) and its entirety (its "connection with the nature of the things they represent"), the inarticulate sublime only impacts the registers of affect. In other words, the sublimity of this cry astonishes the subject with its explo- sive urgency and density; it hurls that subject toward the epistemic instant-the moment of an immediate knowledge-with no time to contemplate or experience properly its taking place.</page><page sequence="29">814 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT The sublimity of Burke's animal cry also pierces the enclaves of Hegel's animal thanatology. Hegel explains: "Every animal finds a voice in its violent death; it expresses itself as a removed-self (als aufgehobnes Selbst)."93 At the moment of its "violent death," every animal, in Hegel's formulation, removes itself from itself, and thus from death. It survives its own death as an inarticulate cry, as the animal voice. Giorgio Agamben reads this displaced phone as the origin of the "voice of consciousness." Inscribing that voice within the infinite negativity from which (Hegelian) language erupts, Agamben hears the voice as the return of negativity. Of the death cry Agamben writes: And although it is not yet meaningful speech, it already contains within itself the power of the negative and of memory ... In dying, the animal finds its voice, it exalts the soul in one voice, and, in this act, it expresses and preserves itself as dead. Thus the animal voice is the voice of death . . which preserves and recalls the living as dead, and it is, at the same time, an immediate trace and memory of death, pure negativity.94 According to the logic ofAgamben's reading of Hegel, the Hegelian dialectic is already at work in the seemingly pre-dialectical moment. At the moment of death, the animal tears itself away from any proper "experience" of death. Only the voice crosses that existential threshold. The body disappears while the voice lingers as pure nega- tivity in the realm of the living. Thus the voice remains apart from the eventness of dying, preserving death in the living world. The animal cry erupts at the moment of death without referent, without body, without meaning: it emerges from and returns to the realm of pure negativity as "death itself." And as such, the animal never dies: it merely vanishes, leaving behind the survival of its voice as an "immediate trace and memory" upon which the second dialectical moment (the inception of language, or the "voice of conscious- ness") is founded. Of Hegel's "magical" transformation of the ani- mal into memory and then language, Agamben concludes that "lan- guage has this power and it truly dwells in the realm of death only because it is the articulation of the 'vanishing trace' that is the animal voice; that is, only because already in its very voice, the animal, in violent death, had expressed itself as removed."95 Like Burke's animal cry that invokes "great ideas" at the limits of con- sciousness, Hegel's animal initiates a dialectics of death from which it is nonetheless excluded. For Hegel, the animal cry erupts from outside the confines of "natural life," it marks death but only as an</page><page sequence="30">MLN 815 event beyond the capacities of animal being. In the Phenomenology, Hegel explains that "Whatever is confined within the limits of a natural life cannot by its own efforts go beyond its immediate exis- tence; but it is driven beyond it by something else, and this uproot- ing entails death."96 The logic here remains impeccably Hegelian: 1) Nature cannot surpass itself by its own means; 2) Death inter- venes from beyond the limits of nature to push nature past itself; 3) And this exteriority gives, in turn, nature its "essence"; 4) The "something else" of nature thus comes to constitute nature's "es- sence." Accordingly, the animal cry (the "something else"), which converges on the limits of reason and being, bursts forth from the site of an absolute exteriority. The cry comes to determine, dialec- tically, the animal's very being. It is, as Hegel writes, not only the expression of alterity, but of the "anti-human." Hegel also ascribes an innate, murderous quality to all modes of conceptualization. The naming of animals, Hegel insists, turns them into ideals. And in the abstraction of the animal from essence to language, the animal dies. Kojeve reads this process in Hegel: As long as the Meaning (or Essence, Concept, Logos, Idea, etc.) is em- bodied in an empirically existing entity, this Meaning or Essence, as well as the entity, lives. For example, as long as the Meaning (or Essence) "dog" is embodied in a sensible entity, this Meaning (Essence) lives: it is the real dog, the living dog which runs, drinks, and eats. But when the Meaning (Essence) "dog" passes into the word "dog"-that is, becomes abstract Concept which is different from the sensible reality that it reveals by its Meaning-the Meaning (Essence) dies: the word "dog" does not run, drink, and eat; in it the Meaning (Essence) ceases to live-that is, it dies. And that is why the conceptual understanding of empirical reality is equivalent to a murder97 Connecting conceptual language to acts of murder, Kojeve brings to light the temporal sequence through which language and the capac- ity for death align themselves. The killing takes place at the moment that language intervenes. Once murdered by abstraction, however, the animal's vitality ceases to adhere to its semantic body. Hence- forth, as word, the "dog" ceases to die empirically, while, as rep- resentation, it continues to die repeatedly. Kojeve continues to unravel Hegel's astonishing killings: "Now, this dog which is annihi- lated at every instant is precisely the dog which endures in Time, which at every instant ceases to live or exist in the Present so as to be annihilated in the Past, or as Past."98 Koj&amp;ve pursues this thought in a footnote that follows from his re-examination of "the Past." Con-</page><page sequence="31">816 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT trasting Aristotle's eternal dog (a dog whose identity as "dog" is dispersed across the species "Dog") with Hegel's mortal dog (a mor- tality that allows Hegel to repeatedly kill the dog), Kojeve offers the following conclusion: Therefore: for Aristotle there is a concept "dog" only because there is an eternal real dog, namely the species "dog," which is always in the present; for Hegel, on the other hand, there is a concept "dog" only because the real dog is a temporal entity-that is, an essentially finite or "mortal" entity, an entity which is annihilated at every instant: and the Concept is the permanent support of this nihilation of the spatial real, while nihila- tion is itself nothing other than Time. For Hegel too, then, the Concept is something that is preserved ("eternally," if you will, but in the sense of: as long as time lasts). But for him, it is only the Concept "dog" that is pre- served (the Concept-that is, the temporal nihilation of the real dog, while nihilation actually lasts as long as Time lasts, since Time is this nihilation as such); whereas for Aristotle, the real dog is what is pre- served (eternally, in the strict sense, since there is eternal return), at least as species. That is why Hegel explains what Aristotle cannot explain, namely, the preservation (in and by Man) of the Concept of an animal belonging, for example, to an extinct species (even if there are no fossil remains) .99 In this account, Kojeve elucidates the notion of eternity as it tra- verses Aristotle and Hegel. While the Aristotelian animal survives time, in spite of time, through speciation (expansion through space and time), the Hegelian animal dies a repeated death because of the murderous persistence of time. In Hegel's dialectic, only the concept survives the nihilating passage of time. It is clear in Kojeve's presentation of the dialectic between being and time, that in fact, the animal, in its "essence," precedes both being and time. Whether in the registers of a spatialized existence or in the eternal returns of a nihilating temporality, the bestial Dasein has vanished before ever having entered the horizons of an ontic or ontological repre- sentation. In other words, the animal has already perished before it has had the chance to represent its death-to represent itself in death. The Hegelian animal suffers an a priori death, a type of pre- extinction. And so the philosophical circle continues to spin: the animal dies at the moment it is thrust into contact with abstraction, with lan- guage. Killed by the word, the animal enters a figurative empire (of signs) in which its death is repeated endlessly. In such transmigra- tions, however, death itself is circumvented: no longer a "dog" but</page><page sequence="32">MLN 817 "Dog," this creature now supersedes any incidental dying of dogs. Thus the "dog" is immortalized, preserved (taxidermically) in the slaughterhouse of being, language. Still, however, following Der- rida's conception of the accountability of the name-"only the name can inherit"-it is only the name of the dog that dies those multiple deaths and lives on in the after-lives of conception.?00 The dog "itself," the preconstitutive entity, has ceased to exist before either existence or time. Thus one finds the Hegelian dog hovering, like Schr6dinger's cat, between the realms of life and death, sus- pended in the interstices of a paralyzed dialectic. In this manner, the semantically reconfigured "dog" is denied access to the present, to self-presence, and is instead relegated to the endless returns of abstraction. Ultimately, the animal is expressed: in its cry and concep- tualization, animal being is marked by expression. Lyotard refers to animal expression as an instance of the "affect- phrase." "One could say that a feeling appears and disappears en- tirely at every instant, that it is ageless," writes Lyotard.0l? As such, feelings, or "affect-phrases," do not participate in the world of dis- course, address, and reference. Rather, the affect-phrase problema- tizes discursive order: "the affect-phrase is untimely and unruly."'02 Not only does the affect-phrase linger in the recesses of the commu- nicative universe, it also, according to Lyotard, disrupts the dialogic momentum. The affect-phrase is a non-language (not "language-al," says Lyotard) whose appearance tears at the unity of language. In Lyotard's Aristotelian reading, the affect-phrase enters communica- tion as an impossible moment of completion that suspends, for the duration of its expression, the activity of language. Following Aris- totle's description of pleasure and pain as being always achieved entirely in the "now," Lyotard claims that the affect-phrase deter- mines a total and finite disclosure: it produces an unrepeatable, singular utterance that disappears for ever.103 As such, the affect- phrase remains severed both from human discourse and subjec- tivity. For Lyotard, the animal serves as a primary agent of the inarticu- late affect-phrase. Endowed with a "communicability or transitivity" that is affective rather than discursive, Lyotard's animal signals its affects from a region that is "banished from human language."'04 From this banished region, however, bursts of affect re-enter the world through secret channels opened up by transference, or affec- tive communication: transference opens a line of communication that is essentially anti-discursive:</page><page sequence="33">818 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT There is, however, a communicability of pleasure and pain, of pathemata, which is effected by the "confused voice" alone, without the mediation of logos. Animals, Aristotle says, "signal" their feelings "to one another."- We already know the stakes that Kant will attach to this sentimental communicability. It can be said to be mute, if it's recalled that the root mu connotes closed lips which suggest keeping still or talking in a muted voice. From that root comes murmurer (to murmur), mugir (to low), mystere (mystery) and the vulgar [low] Latin muttum, which yielded mot (word) in French. Muted communication is made up of continuous inha- lations and exhalations of air: grunts, gasps and sighs.105 The "muted communication" comprising "grunts, gasps and sighs" brings one within earshot of the astonished (and astonishing, in Burke's sense of the term) cries of the Rue Morgue assassin. And if those murmuring animals remain exiles from the "political commu- nity," then they are also exempt from any responsibility as such to the demands of its logos. For Lyotard, the animal resides in a topos of the "differend," an irresolvable ethical impasse.106 The animal cannot be held accountable for its crimes because, like Oedipus, it is un- aware of its actions. To this extent, Lyotard's animal implies a sepa- rate mode of being that can be best described as unconscious. Lyotard's murmuring animal communicates not consciously but un- consciously. According to Lyotard, then, the animal opens up a channel of unconscious communication that carries with it the pos- sibility of an unconscious world, the world of the unconscious. It is thus toward the unconscious that modern philosophy inevitably edges. The figure of the animal leads, in many ways, that progres- sion: dispossessed of language and mortality, and excluded from the philosophical community of beings, the animal recedes into what Lyotard terms a "time before logos": a time, that is, before the hu- man subject. The human subject has determined thus far much of the discus- sion of animal being: from Aristotelian speechlessness to Cartesian automatism and Hegelian negation, the philosophical animal has come to occupy a perpetual position in the shadow of human ontol- ogy. The animal has become, according to this genealogy, a trace. Despite Heidegger's insistence upon its "crossed-through" world, however, the animal never fully exits the range of human awareness. Even without the fullness of world, the animal problematizes human ontology. Or rather, precisely because it appears to occupy an inde- terminate world, the animal threatens the safety of world, of the world that human beings inhabit. In other words, animal being adds</page><page sequence="34">M LN 819 something to the topos of ontology that the philosophical discourse does not or cannot fully absorb, sublate, or abolish. Something about animal being remains in excess of the human discourse on it. That is, animal being opens an irreducible space between manifesta- tion and metaphysics, between immanence and the unconscious. Stated as a formula, the animal can be pictured as a being minus being, being, or b - b-pure negation. In the philosophical dis- course, the figure of the animal often signifies such phantasms. Lyotard contests the philosophical desire to configure the animal as a locus of negation, as a pure body. He writes: "[T]he body, as it exists, presupposes logos. Logical animals alone have a body."107 This is not to say that animals, who have bodies, have logos. Rather, it means that since body and logos are inextricable, the animal is either a purely phantasmatic creature with neither body nor logos, or it occupies in a manner yet to be elucidated the body and logos of the human being. Thus, despite the conceptual distances and existen- tial barriers that human beings maintain against the threat of the wild, all human beings, like the L'Espanayes of Rue Morgue, are vulnerable to the sudden appearance of animals. Nor is mankind restricted, in its vulnerability, to bodily assault: the crises that the animal unleashes strike at the core of human existence. The strange ontology of animal being disrupts mankind's notions of conscious- ness, being, and world: in the "presence" of animals, mankind is thrust from the traditional loci of its subjectivity. Contact with ani- mals turns human beings into others, effects a kind of meta- morphosis. Animality is, in this sense, a kind of seduction, a kind of magnetic force or gaze that brings mankind to the threshold of its subjectivity. In proximity to animals, human beings are overcome by the desire of others, by the pull of alterity and the animal The present discussion of philosophy and the animal has re- The present discussion of philosophy and the animal has re- mained, in its brief compass, within the confines of "modern" phi- losophy, that is, within the body of work that questions mankind's being. By contrast, the pre-moderns or "theriophilists," have ex- plored the inherent rationality of animal being.108 In fact, pre- modern philosophers believed animals to be particularly suited toward certain epistemological activities. From Chrysippus' exem- plary dog to Montaigne's imaginative beasts, the pre-modern ani- mal opens up vast areas of knowledge.109 Montaigne (1533-1592), for example, insists that animals are the primordial possessors of language. He asserts:</page><page sequence="35">820 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT As for speech, it is certain that if it is not natural, it is not neces- sary ... And it is not credible that Nature has denied us this resource that she has given to many other animals: for what is it but speech, this faculty we see in them of complaining, rejoicing, calling to each other for help, inviting each other to love, as they do by the use of their voice? How could they not speak to one another? They certainly speak to us, and we to them.10 For Montaigne, who quotes freely from the ancients, especially Plu- tarch and Pliny, animals are not only capable of language but of reason. And it is a mere failure of the human faculties, in Mon- taigne's view, that this truth passes unrecognized.11 Animals, ac- cording to the pre-modern philosophers, precede human beings in their claims to knowledge and the earth. In his Natural History, for example, Pliny the Elder suggests that human beings, who enter life with little more than the ability to cry, might be better off unborn. Comparing the innate skills of animals with the almost total absence of those in human beings, he writes: Man, however, knows nothing unless by learning-neither how to speak nor how to walk nor how to eat; in a word, the only thing he knows instinctively is how to weep. And so there have been many people who judged that it would have been better not to have been born, or to have died as soon as possible.112 Since human beings must work to secure their existence and, unlike animals, nothing is given a priori toward their survival, Pliny insists that "we cannot confidently say whether she [Nature] is a good parent to mankind or a harsh stepmother."113 As Pliny's comment suggests, when compared to animals, human beings cannot but doubt their lineage, their standing in the worldly order. Despite the celebration of humanism that modernity embodies, mankind's need to work at survival has produced, according to Nietzsche, a culture of ressentiment. Accordingly, mankind has come to assume the role of a resentful sovereign, of an unnatural heir or stepson. Meanwhile, the disappearance of animal being in the discourse of modernity has also implemented a state of mourning: mankind has yet to recover, Nietzsche says, from the impossible death of the animal. Of mourning and the modern era, Nietzsche writes: "[T]hus began the gravest and uncanniest illness, from which hu- manity has not yet recovered, man's suffering of man, of himself--the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a</page><page sequence="36">M L N 821 declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy, and terribleness had rested hitherto."1l4 From a historical viewpoint, modernity has caused a catastrophic break in the genealogy of animal being. Modernity represents a crucial moment in the consolidation of metaphysics during which the superiority of mankind is achieved from the "hitherto" lowest ranks of being. In the dialectical account of modernity, an a priori animality (thesis) is subsumed by a competing humanity (antith- esis): as a result, animality ceases to occupy a proper space apart from the humanity that succeeds, appropriates, enframes it. The animal, according to that historical rendering, no longer remains in the realm of ontology; it has been effaced. Since philosophical rea- son does not recognize the death of the animal, however, the ne- gated animal never passes into an authentic state of non-existence. In the era of modernity, therefore, the animal is relegated to the interstices of ontology. Neither present nor absent, the animal hangs in the dialectical moment that marks the advent of human history. In this manner, the animal becomes an active phantom in the crypt of modernity. Ineradicable, the animal continues to haunt the recesses of the modern human being, appearing only to rees- tablish the human identity in moments of crisis. And because mod- ern philosophy fails to eliminate entirely the residues of the animal, its texts continue to inscribe the secret history of the animal as phantom. In the philosophical world, the figure of the animal moves undying from one corpus to another, one text to another, leaving distinct though faintly perceptible tracks, signs of its migra- tion across the field. Although this effort to track the animal world has strayed from the Rue Morgue house into the philosophical structures that neigh- bor Poe's animal topology, philosophy is by no means the only framework within which to house a discussion of the animal, for while the figure of the animal plays an important role in the philo- sophical text, equally significant and often conflicting ideas of ani- mal being populate the fields of literature, psychoanalysis, and the technological media. (Not to mention, of course, the scientific disci- plines in which animal ontology is never in question: biology, zool- ogy, animal psychology, and the other natural sciences.) In those epistemic regions, the animal inhabits world in ways that philosophy forbids. The literary genre of the fable, for example, from Aesop to Kafka, equips the animal with a discursive and pedagogical func- tion; Freudian psychoanalysis records the movement of the animal</page><page sequence="37">822 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT figure into the unconscious from magnetism to hypnosis and trans- ference; and in the cinema, in many respects the exemplary techno- logical medium, the figure of the animal resumes the task of its namesake animus, generating life in the form of animation. And although the present analysis has responded first to the cries at Rue Morgue, those other calls that attest to the entry of animal being into the human world still await an answer. For Poe's orangutan, by breaking through the walls that separate the domestic from the wild, has exposed humanity to the multiplicity of alien phone that orbits the other world, the wildside. Future inquiries of the animal must continue to disclose the world from which the animal en- croaches upon being, continue to listen for the calls that sound the animal world.

Of course, an animal may inhibit a move- ment, can abstain from an incautious gesture, for example in a defensive or offensive predatory strategy, such as in the delimitation of sexual territory or in a mating ritual. One might say, then, that animals can not respond to the inquisition or requisition of a stimulus or of a complex of stimuli. According to this somewhat naive philosophy of the animal world, one may nevertheless observe that animals are incapable of keeping or even having a secret, because they cannot represent as such, as an object before consciousness, something that they would then forbid themselves from showing" (86-87). 1 Ibid., 87. 2 Aristotle, "Politics," in The Complete Works of Aristotle, 1988.

Because pleasure and pain are whole and complete ("achieved," claims Lyotard, citing Aristotle), they do not exist, so to speak, in time. 3 Jacques Derrida, Grammatology, 166.

Some years later, Wittgenstein questions the relation between hope and language, between being and mankind's exclusive capacity for the future.

But can he also believe his master will come the day after to-morrow?- And what can he not do here?-How do I do it?-How am I supposed to answer this? Can only those hope who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of a language. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this complicated form of life" (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E.

Replacing the question of capacity with one of desire or simple pragmatics, he writes: "It is sometimes said that animals do not talk because they lack the mental capacity. And this means: 'they do not think, and that is why they do not talk.' But-they simply do not talk. Or to put it better: they do not use language-if we accept the most primitive forms of language.-Commanding, questioning, recounting, chatting are as much a part of our natural history as walking, eating, drinking, playing" (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 12). According to Wittgenstein's analysis, another natural history must be written for animals. 47 This logic concerning language and the animal in Nietzsche is derived from Derrida's reading of Nietzsche, "woman," and the politics of castration. In Spurs, Derrida explains: "'Woman'-her name made epoch-no more be- lieves in castration's exact opposite, anti-castration, than she does in castration itself" (Jacques Derrida, Spurs: Nietzsche's Styles, trans. Barbara Harlow [Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1979], 61). "Woman," according to Derrida, plays with castration, with the economy to which "she" is not bound. 48 Nietzsche, "Uses," 61. 49 Friedrich Nietzsche, Ecce Homo, ed. and trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Vintage, 1967), 303. Earlier in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche confides that his preg- nancy with Zarathustra had lasted eighteen months. This "might suggest," Nietzsche writes, "at least to Buddhists, that I am really a female elephant" (295). Also, one cannot forget the scene of Nietzsche's collapse when "on January 3, 1889, he threw himself in tears on the neck of a beaten horse" (Cited in Roland Barthes' Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography, trans.

In this same passage Heidegger quotes a line that was later expunged from Nietzsche's preface to Twilight of the Idols: 'His love of animals-men have always recognized the solitary by means of this trait.' Regarding Nietzsche's notion of an "individuality" that arises from a force in excess of "totality and subjectivity," see Werner Hamacher's "'Disgregation of the Will': Nietzsche on the Individual and Individuality," in Reconstructing Individualism: Autonomy, In- dividuality, and the Self in Western Thought, ed. Thomas C. Heller, Morton Sosna, and David E. Wellbery, trans. Jeffrey S. Librett (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1986), 106-39. In this essay, Hamacher analyzes Nietzsche's concept of individuality as one of "outliving." For Nietzsche, Hamacher explains, "[t]he individual is nothing other than the unreined, voluptuous self-outliving of life, the ongoing passing away of an excessive being no longer susceptible of being seized in the unity of a historical, social, or logical form. Individuality 'is' outliving. Living without living. 'Living.' The individual does not live. It out- lives. Its being is being out and being over, an insubstantial remainder and excess beyond every determinable form of human life. Instead of being a social or psychological form of human existence, the individual-the self- surpassing of type, or genius-is the announcement of what, generally trans- lated as 'superman' or 'overman,' is best translated as 'outman.' But the individ- ual is this announcement only in the mode of an uncanny, dangerous, luxuriating monstrosity, in the form of one who, having outlasted the death of its type, has returned to earth in the form of a living corpse" (119, emphasis added). 53 Heidegger, Nietzsche, vol. 2, 47. Heidegger's invocation of the "Do not disturb" sign provides an interesting glimpse into the living quarters of twentieth- century philosophy. Transient and assailed (disturbed), philosophy appears to have assumed residence in the temporary and anonymous shelters of motels and/or hotels. One imagines in Heidegger's analogy, a figure of philosophy on the run, on the road, pursued (disturbed) rather than in-pursuit-of. 54 Ibid., 45-46. For an analysis of Nietzsche's midday temporalities, see Jacques Derrida's "Otobiographies" in The Ear of the Other, ed. Christie V. McDonald, trans.

Walter Kaufmann (New York: Random House, 1967), 61 (emphasis added). 58 Nietzsche's global reconfiguration of morality and its histories is founded upon the necessity for mankind to learn from the animals the act of forgetting and overcoming resentment. Without "this apparatus of repression," mankind cannot, in turn, learn what is most essential to its survival: the ability to prom- ise. With typical rhetorical and idiomatic flourish, Nietzsche explains: "The man in whom this apparatus of repression is damaged and ceases to function properly may be compared (and more than merely compared) with a dyspeptic-he cannot 'have done' with anything. Now this animal which needs to be forgetful, in which forgetting represents a force, a form of robust health, has bred in itself an opposing faculty, a memory, with the aid of which forget- fulness is abrogated in certain cases-namely those cases where promises are made" (Nietzsche, Genealogy, 58). For Nietzsche, the promise, the ability to promise, is the only counter-measure to mankind's history of ressentiment. The ability to promise makes the future possible: without promising, there is no</page><page sequence="42">M L N 827 future. The promise, however, is only made possible, can only be made and kept, as an abrogation of forgetting; as a deferral or suspension of the act of forgetting. Thus, the capacity to forget must first exist before any promise can be made. This, according to Nietzsche, remains the most important task that mankind faces. 59 Derrida, "'Eating Well,'" 111-12. 60 Rene Descartes, "Discourse on the Method," in Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings, trans.

Schopenhauer goes on to claim that this desire to survive, to be aware of one's own continued survival "arises not from the individuality but from existence as such, is intrinsic to everything that exists and is indeed the reason why it exists, and it is consequently satisfied by existence as such: it is this alone to which this desire applies, and not exclusively to some particular existence. That which desires existence so impetuously is only indirectly the individual!" 72 Ibid., 71. In The Gay Science, Nietzsche extends Schopenhauer's consciousness into the realm of language. Retaining the idea of the sociality of consciousness, Nietzsche insists that consciousness arises from the physiological necessities of communication and not from the metaphysics of language. The distinction is crucial for it marks one of the transitions from a philosophical discourse to an evolutionary one. Nietzsche writes that "consciousness has developed only under the pressure of the need for communication; that from the start it was needed and useful only between human beings (particularly between those who com- manded and those who obeyed); and that it also developed in proportion to the degree of this utility. Consciousness is really only a net of communication between human beings; it is only as such that it had to develop; a solitary human being who lived like a beast of prey would not have needed it. That our</page><page sequence="43">828 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT actions, thoughts, feelings, and movements enter our own consciousness-at least a part of them-that is a result of a 'must' that for a terribly long time lorded it over man. As the most endangered animal, he needed help and protec- tion, he needed his peers, he had to learn to express his distress and make himself understood; and for all of this he needed 'consciousness' first of all, he needed to know himself what distressed him, he needed to 'know' how he felt, he needed to 'know' what he thought. For, to say it once more: Man, like every living being, thinks continually without knowing it; the thinking that rises to consciousness is only the smallest part of this-the most superficial and worst part-for only this conscious thinking takes the form of words, which is to say signs of communication, and this fact uncovers the origin of consciousness" (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans.

Unable to perfect itself, the animal cannot partake, according to Rousseau, in the going-to-be of the future. In a statement made obsolete by the advent of evolution, Rousseau writes: "[A] n animal, at the end of a few months, is what it will be all its life; and its species, at the end of a thousand years, is what is was in the first of those thousand years" (45). 78 Ibid., 46. 79 Ibid. 80 Derrida, Of Grammatology, 182. 81 Ibid., 184. 82 Rousseau, "Inequality," 49. 83 Ibid. 84 Immanuel Kant, "Conjectural Beginning of Human History," in Kant: On His- tory, ed.

The essay comes from the text of a lecture that Lyotard addressed to the Whitney Humanities Center at Yale University in 1992. 102 Ibid. 103 In the "Nicomachean Ethics," Aristotle writes: pleasure "is a whole, and at no time can one find a pleasure whose form will be completed if the pleasure lasts longer. For this reason, too, it is not a movement... [I]t is not possible to move otherwise than in time, but it is possible to be pleased; for that which takes place in a moment is a whole" (The Complete Works of Aristotle, 1858). 104 Lyotard, "The Inarticulate." 105 Ibid. Hegel also describes the enclosed world of inarticulate phrases which, as Lyotard insists, does not open onto a universe of communication. On the intrusion of the voice of consciousness into the animal's affective muteness, Hegel writes: "The empty voice of the animal acquires a meaning that is infi- nitely determinate in itself. The pure sound of the voice, the vowel, is differen- tiated since the organ of the voice presents its articulation as a particular articulation with its differences. This pure sound is interrupted by mute [con- sonants], the true and proper arrestation of mere resonation" (Hegel, Jenenser Realphilosophie, cited in Agamben, Language, 44). Agamben explains that the consonant creates alternation in an attempt to preserve, through sublation, the "mere resonance" of the animal cry: "What is articulated here? Hegel responds: the 'pure sound' of the animal voice, the vowel that is interrupted and arrested through mute consonants. The articulation appears, that is, as a process of differentiation, of interruption and preservation of the animal voice" (44). 106 See Jean-Francois Lyotard, The Differend: Phrases in Dispute, trans. Georges Van Den Abbeele (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988). 107 Lyotard, "The Inarticulate." Leibniz also questions the possibility of an empty body. He writes: "[I]f there were no souls or something analogous to them, then there would be no I [Ego], no monads, no real unities, and therefore there would be no substantial multitudes; indeed there would be nothing in bodies but phantasms" (Leibniz, "From the Letters toJohann Bernoulli," 167).</page><page sequence="45">830 AKIRA MIZUTA LIPPIT 108 George Boas, "Theriophily" in Dictionary of the History of Ideas, ed. Philip P. Wiener, 5 vols. (New York: Scribners, 1973), vol. 4, 384-89. 109 Boas recounts the famous episode: "Chrysippus' dog,... looking for its mas- ter in a wood, comes to a triple fork. He sniffs down two of the branches and finds no scent of his master. He then without sniffing darts down the third branch, thus proving his reasoning powers" (Boas, "Theriophily," 384). Ac- cording to Montaigne, dogs grieve, mourn, and dream as do horses, while tortoises and ostriches hatch their eggs with "ejaculative" glances. And cats, in Montaigne's notes, can fell their prey with lethal and insistent looks (Michel de Montaigne, "Of the Power of the Imagination" in The Complete Essays of Montaigne, trans. Donald Frame [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1943], 74-75). Throughout his work Montaigne argues that animals posses various imaginative skills that both align them with and differentiate them from hu- man beings. A version of Montaigne's belief in animal imagination returns in Jakob von Uexkiill's twentieth-century studies of the animal Umwelt. See in this connection, Pierre Alferi, Le cheminfamilier du poisson combatif (Paris: P. 0. L., 1992). 110 Montaigne, "Apology for Raymond Sebond," in Complete Essays, 335. 111 Of the evident similarity between beasts and men, Montaigne explains: "There is no apparent reason to judge that the beasts do by natural and obligatory instinct the same things that we do by our choice and cleverness. We must infer from like results like faculties, and consequently confess that this same reason, this same method that we have for working, is also that of the animals. Why do we imagine in them this compulsion of nature, we who feel no similar effect?" ("Apology," 336-37). 112 Pliny the Elder, Natural History: A Selection, trans. John F. Healy (New York: Penguin, 1991), 74. 113 Ibid. 114 Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, 85. In a different context, Locke and Kant connect the sundering of mankind from its animal past, from nature, to the question of ethics. Decrying the cruelty that human beings regularly exhibit toward their own young, Locke writes: "The Dens of Lions and Nurseries of Wolves know no such Cruelty as this: These Savage Inhabitants of the Desert obey God and Nature in being tender and careful of their Off-spring: They will Hunt, Watch, Fight, and almost Starve for the Preservation of their Young, never part with them, never forsake them till they are able to shift for them- selves; And is it the Privilege of Man alone to act more contrary to Nature than the Wild and most Untamed part of the Creation?" (John Locke, Two Treatises of Government [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960], 217). In The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant also makes reference to animal virtues: "The first, though not the principal, duty of man to himself as an animal being is to preserve himselfin his animal nature" (Immanuel Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals, trans. Mary Gregor [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991], 218). Nietzsche insists upon the necessity of overcoming, of surviving that dialectic of melancholia. For Nietzsche, melancholia can be surpassed only when man- kind can promise itself futurity, that is, promise itself the right to make prom- ises. He poses the following challenge: "To breed an animal with the right to make promises-is not this the paradoxical task that nature has set itself in the case of man? is it not the real problem regarding man?"
