Addendum 1. por present purposes, I shall merely note the Y 30, Y 32, and the Old Avestan words and phrases in 32.8-14 whose basis in the Hymn to Hauma OAv. Hauma-hymn can be traced through mu tually sequential correspondences in Y 9-10: The phraseology of 30.1-8, including the theme 32.8" yamas-cit wiwahusah, cf. 9.28-29; 32.8a" of bliss in 30.1 and the "twinship" of the Spirits ainah- (completing concatenation with 32.16c' in 30.3, is influenced by 32.1-8, whose wording ainah-), cf. 9.28-29; 32.10a' *haumd (cryptic pun in turn reflects a relationship with what now via hau ma), cf. 9.27 seq. and 9.30; 32.10a"-b' must be reconstructed as the Old Avestan proto- wainahai . . . gdm asibya, cf. 9.29; 32.10a"-b wa type of the presently extant "Hôm-Yast." dai waizdat aitàunai, cf. 9.30-31; 32.12b wrds The mutually sequential correspondences be- (and 32.1b wrâzma), cf. 10.8; 32.14b" wisantai, tween 32.1-8 and 30.1-8 are as follows: Nouns cf. 10.9; 32.14c" gdus, cf. 10.20; 32.14c" du for 'bliss' from Vwmz (32.1b" wrâzma, 30.1c" rausam, cf. 10.21. wrdzd); forms from Vwar 'to opt, to choose,' Thus it unexpectedly emerges that the words (32.2c" warmadi, 30.2b" dwarndu)·, maz- 'great' for 'bliss,' 32.1b' wrdzma (acrostically at 33.2c) (32.3b' mas, 30.2c' mazah)·, asru- in past passive and thereby 30.1c" wrdzd (cf. 49.8a"-b' wrdzis of 'hear' (32.c" asrudwam, 30.3a" asruwatâm); tarn artahya . . . saram),14 all presented (with en acista 'worst things' object of verbs 'to accom- cryptive embellishments) as the reward for pious plish' (32.4a" acistd dantah, 30.5a" acista behavior, have their ultimate textual motivation 16</page><page sequence="17">schwartz: Revelations, Theology, and Poetics in the Gathas in a riposte against the OAv. Hauma-hymn's as sertion that hauma's intoxication is accompa nied by bliss (*widzmand &gt; 10.8 &lt;uruuâsmana&gt;). Even more surprisingly, it now appears that merely the meaning of the name Yama (YAv. Yima) 'Twin' (which the legendary figure had from Indo-Iranian times in reference to his twin ship with his sister *Yaml) suggested an adjective 'twin(ned)', in 30.3, to characterize the two dif ferentiated aspects of manyu- 'spirit.' I see in the relevant Gathic verses an ironic attack on the worship of Hauma, who is the spe cific exemplification of the daiwas of Y 32.1 and 3-5. Y 32 (with Y 48) thus furnishes uniquely detailed proof that Young Avestan compositions which are syncretistically Zoroastrianized hymns to deities of the oldest Iranian pantheon may retain extensive textual cores which antedate Zarathushtra. Addendum 2: The Construction of Y 45 The construction of Y 45 has hitherto lacked a systematic analysis. Each section is composi tionally a complete mini-poem (showing the con struction more extensively illustrated by Y 44: a sequence of stanzas, each of which has the same opening except for the last stanza, which provides the concluding moral). In Y 45, stanzas 1-6 begin with at fia waxsyâ Ί shall speak out,' and stanzas 8-11 begin with tam nah and a desiderative phrase pertaining to worship, the whole amounting to Ί am wishing to . . . Him for us via. . .' Each of the two mini-poems has a ring-com positional form: 45.1 and 7 share isa- 'seek,' Vsrau 'hear,' and drugwant 'wrongful.' 45.2 and 6 share the base *swan- 'holy' + manyu- 'spirit' and xiatu 'intellect',· 45.3 and 5 both state that Mazdà/The Most Holy One spoke (waucat/mraut. . . wacah) to Zarathushtra (mai 'to me'), continued by the reported reaction, y ai '(and) they who . . 45.4 and 45.3 share mazddh + Vwaid 'to know'; 45.4 and 1 share wiswâ 'all/ im 'this,' and nait 'not'; and 45.4 and 7 share mazddh + Vdâ 'to create.' 45.4 and 5 share wahistam and Vdâ. 45.8 and 11 share dmâna-/dam- 'house (of Mazda)/ with terminology of cultic hospitality/cut and family status found in 45.9 and 11, and as equivalent of the divine house, the xsadia- 'Dominion' linking 45.9 and 10 (note also, with the latter, the rare hai 'to Him' in 45.8, 10, and 11). The stanzas of the entire (joined) poem are paired in each di rection (45.1-2 share waranâ-, 45.3-4 share ahaus ahya and derivatives of the two homophonous and semantically associable roots waiz, resp. 'to act upon, enact' [45.3 warsanti} and 'to nourish, strengthen, energize, activate' [45.4 waizayant- = Vedic ûrjàyant-]·, 45.5 and 6 Vsrau 'hear,' and wahista- 'best'; 45.6 and 7 Vah 'to be' in 3 pers. sg.; 45.8 and 9 derivatives of homophonous roots Vwarz; 45.10 and 11 dam- 'house,' and ara- 'ari ght, conforming, normative' + Vman 'to think'), and then concentrically concatenate in criss cross: 45.1 and 10 Vsrau 'to hear'; 45.2 and 11 da yanâ 'envisionment' and *swan- 'holy'; 45.3 and 8 [-)warSa- [Vwarz 'to enact'); 43.4 and 9 Vwarz 'to strengthen',· 43.5 and 48.7 amrtât- 'immortal ity' and Vdâ 'to establish, cause, create'; 45.5-7 as above; 45.6 and 1 Vsrau 'to hear' and manyu 'spirit'; 45.6 and 11 swantâ 'via holy . . .'. In addition, 45.7-11 (which are enclosed via Vsu 'to benefit, to save') elaborate the same inven tory as the originally concatenating pair 49.10 and 49.5 as to how, through good 'envisionment' (dayanâ) 'the souls of the righteous' are, as re quited, to be in the divine house [dam-] and/or dominion [xsaOra-] together with Good Mind (wahu- manah-) and Rightness (arta-), Regular Thought (aramati-), reverence (namah-) and nourishment (warz-/wazdah-/izâ/âzuti-). Notes 1. Henceforth I shall use a reconstructive transcrip tion for the Gathic text similar to that of R. S. Beekes. The vulgate spelling of Gathic words will be given in angled brackets: &lt; &gt;. 2. For the translation of ya'ah- as race-contest and for racing imagery, see Schwartz 2003b, in which the word is discussed. Note there also my discussion of racing imagery, which also figures in 43.5-6, on pp. 9 10 in the predent article. In the present article in this volume I also discuss the racing terminology of 30.10 on p. 2, and for 43.5-6 see pp. 9-10. 3. In Avestan, as in many languages, the words for 'sleep' and 'dream' are the same (so Pers. xvab). 'Sleep' is hwafna- (&lt;xvafna-&gt;) in Gathic (44.5c") and in YAv., in which xvafna- gives axvafna- 'unsleeping,' axvaf niia- 'id.' &gt; 'attentive (in combat).' 'Dream' is also at tested for YAv. at Yt 13.104 as first in a series of four terms each preceded by αγα- 'bad/ the other three of which, when properly explained, belong to the same 17</page><page sequence="18">schwartz: Revelations, Theology, and Poetics in the Gathas semantic field: Following (bad) xvafna- 'dream/ daësa is not 'omen' but 'apparition, specter' (cf.

Av. vifra- retains the basic Indo-Iranian meaning ""shaken up' from Vvip 'to agitate,' whereas in Vedic viprd [maintained as an epithet of Pdura] became the com mon term for 'ecstatic seer'). Finally pairikâ (*parikd, WMIr. parig), etymologically 'she who surrounds' is best explained as *'nightmare, succubus,' whence 'witch/demoness.' I hope to present a variety of evi dence for this interpretation elsewhere. 4. Cf. Schwartz 2003b. The Pindaric phrase is of Orphic origin. As I shall elaborate elsewhere, the Orphic Frag. 334 Kern άείδω ξυνετοΊσι Ί sing for those who can understand,' has been traced by M. L. West to the Protogonos Theogony, which is, inter alia, reflected in both Pindar's eschatological digression O. 2.83-91, and in Euripides' fragmentary Hypsipyle. I see variants of the Orphic phrase in Euripides' Iphi geneia in Tauris 1092; Iphigeneia in Aulis 466, and Phœnissse 1506. 5. For 30.7c cf. 28.11c manyaus hacd ... α ahus parwiyah 'in accord with (Thy) Spirit, existence will come about (as it was) first.' 6. The accounts conflate the Gathic passages per taining to the vision with 30.3 seq., for which the Pahlavi translators did not realize that a dream was involved. The conflation is based on the similarity between 30.3-4 and 45.1-3. 7. 31.6 haOyam man0ram, cf. Vedic satydm man trdm; haOya- (&lt; PIE *H{snt-yo-) 'real, true' recapitu lates its etymological sense 'corresponding to what is,' cf. 31.5 wauca ... yd .. . ahati. 8.
