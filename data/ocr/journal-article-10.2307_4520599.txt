Illustrations, notes, index. xii + 180 pp. $21.95 paper. As the desire for farm profits meshes with population growth in a downward spiral deadly for sustainable agri- culture, CarolynJohnsen's Raising a Stink offers a glimmer of hope for grass-roots reform of American farming prac- tices. Not a historian, Johnsen offers journalism at its peak-her book is an insightful, well-grounded study of the opposition to factory hog farms in Nebraska during the late 1990S. AlthoughJohnsen does address some of the science of factory hog farming-the dangers of eating meat fed regular doses of antibiotics, the potential pathogen risk of decom- posed hog carcasses, the human suffering engendered by breathing manure-befouled air-her interest is in the nature and process of opposition on a political and personal level. Johnsen addresses the problem of opposing factory farming in a state whose rural counties are in steady decline. The people who embrace these types of farms are often neighbors to those who oppose them. Both groups use the rhetoric of the family farm in their arguments. Both groups see the other as undermining their way and quality of life. Using a variety of personal stories gleaned from extensive interviewing, Johnsen investigates the reasons why some rural Nebraskans, and not others, chose to fight factory hog farming. The bulk of her narrative, however, tells how opponents educated themselves in the complex issues at stake and then fought the factory farms at every level of government. It is this complicated tale that is the strength of the book.Johnsen does an excellentjob of explaining the vari- ousjurisdictional complications; for example, some county supervisors tried to prevent hog farms by denying them easements to run hog-waste pipes under county roads. This resulted in the counties being sued for breach of state laws. Generally, state and national laws regulating the hog business were weaker than local ordinances, as powerful lobbying groups have invested vast sums to keep the politi- cians, if not the pigs, sweet. Politicians claimed to represent the good of the whole state, leading to such absurd state- ments as that by the Nebraska director of agriculture who announced: "Environmental regulations must not restrict, either economically or environmentally, agricultural growth" (p. 27). Ultimately,Johnsen's conclusions are as complex as her 92</page><page sequence="2">SPRING 2004 r- REVIEWS narrative. Clearly, the power of money and politics tends to favor the factory farmers. However, there are environmen- tal gains being made throughout the nation as legislation is passed to protect the purity of air, water, and soil. Addi- tionally, a growing number of farmers and consumers are choosing to raise/eat meat grown in a more environmen- tally friendly manner. This choice is as much based on taste as on a concern for nature. Finally,Johnsen places the responsibility for the future where it belongs-firmly on all citizens-saying, "Whether economic forces will over- whelm the concern for the air and water and the quality of life in rural communities is at least in part in the hands of people who eat pork and those whom they elect to do their will" (p. 147). Claire Strom Agricultural History North Dakota State University, Fargo TRUE GRIZ Glimpses of Fernie, Stahr, Easy, Dakota, and Other Real Bears in the Modern World Douglas H. Chadwick Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 2003. Illustrations, map. 176 pp. $24.95 cloth. In his introduction Douglas Chadwick promises us that True Grizz is different from most collections of grizzly stories because it is not ultimately about people instead of bears, as grizzly tales tend to be. Rather, Chadwick's self- stated goal is to "sidestep the images that turn out to be reflections of our own complicated nature, and keep on looking from fresh angles until we finally just see real griz- zlies in the real world (p. 9). That is a tall ambition, and one generating terrific anticipation in any reader hungry for a fresh, innovative approach to bear stories. Unfortunately, the book fails to achieve this lofty goal, abandoning it almost from the start. Instead, Chadwick seems to want to explore the possibilities for developing a narrative style that expresses emotions and values relative to grizzlies and wilderness without compromising scientific validity. However, given the overall tenor of the book, this equally valuable goal ends up seeming like little more than an attempt tojustify Chadwick's admitted tendency toward romance and anthropomorphism. Written in the model of several recent books in which writers accompany search-and-rescue employees on the job, Chadwick's narrative allows the reader to tag along with Carrie Hunt of the Wind River Bear Institute and Tim Manley of Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks as they use telemetry to track grizzlies around the Scenes of Visionary Enchantment Reflections on Lewis and Clark By Dayton Duncan More a revisiting than a retelling of the story of the Corps of Discovery, n Dayton Duncan s book reintroduces us to people and places along the trail, reflects on events large and small that occurred during the expedition, and offers constant- and constantly entertaining-insights into why, two centuries later, the saga of Lewis and Clark continues to exert such a powerful hold on our national imagination. $22 cloth number of mountain cabins inhabited by folks who either have refused to or are unaware of how to acclimate to living in grizzly country (e.g., don't store eighty pounds of dog food on your front porch). Chadwick succeeds in making clear the enormity of the human problem but spends far more time describing the efforts to "educate" bears through a variety of aversive con- ditioning techniques than detailing attempts to educate people-when it appears that trying to teach humans not to leave bear attractants lying around is probably far more effective than trying to convince bears not to eat them. He also fails to seriously address the habitat encroachment issues that create the kinds of problems he describes. Chadwick may have chosen to focus on the "bear educa- tion" part of the story in order to stay true to his goal of telling bears' tales, but in the process the bears themselves end up being differentiated largely by their degrees of incorrigibility and whether or not they survived to den and then resume their familiar habits the following season. The book also gets a little plodding and may be more depress- ing than it needs to be; it would be interesting to know the success ratio of reeducated bears versus reeducated people in this area. True Grizz would be a good book for those who, like Chadwick, are "unrepentant grizz groupies" (his descrip- 93</page></plain_text>
