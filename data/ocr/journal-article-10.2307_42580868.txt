<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLOGGLIES AND POLITICS FENTON JAMESON * With plogglies, then, everything can be explained very satisfactorily - to anyone who believes in plogglies. There are many plogglies scurrying around us today, although some of the modern plogglies are much more subtle than brownies, for example. One might say that they are more abstract. Wendell Johnson. Semantic the magic obscurantism, of words are the as mistaking widespread of in words politics for as things, in any other and belief field of in the magic of words are as widespread in politics as in any other field of human endeavor. Sir James Frazer's theory that the king evolved from the magician might easily be extended to explain the operations of the modern art of statecraft, were it not for the implications in The Golden Bough that the most successful chiefs were those who clearly recognized the inefficacy of their magic and used it only to hoodwink their followers. Although it is obvious that the employment of scare headlines and other propaganda techniques to de- lude the citizenry is still a major preoccupation of statesmen, an inquiry into the premises and theories on which much of the strategy and tactics of modern politics are based will show that word-magic, anthropomorphism, and other primitive notions are still working beliefs. To present examples of these magical notions about the nature of politics, I have tried to abstract, from specific actions and theories, some general prin- ciples which are commonly accepted and approved. When so isolated, these principles at once reveal their fundamentally nonsensical character.1 I. Pursuit of Logic There is a widespread belief that a given type of political structure will foster corresponding qualities in a nation because 'it logically follows that . . . For example , it is believed that ' democratic" structures inevitably fosters r demo- cratic ' qualities, irrespective of historical evidence that may exist to the con - trary. Perhaps the best example of the application of this notion is the argument * A recent graduate of the Russian Institute of Columbia University, Mr. Jameson is now working toward a Ph.D. degree in government and public law. 1 Many of these examples were first brought to my attention by Professor Franz Neumann's lectures on German Government at Columbia University. 18</page><page sequence="2">autumn 1949 PLOGGLIES AND POLITICS over the 'innate' qualities of 'federalism' vs. 'centralism.' In this article, 'federal- ism' is used as it is in the study of comparative government, to describe a govern- mental structure in which certain powers are exercised by regional organs of government and other powers by an over-all government of the nation as a whole. 'Centralism' is characteristic of a government in which all local powers are delegated from a central authority, which can alter, amend, or abolish them at will. The folklore of the United States, currently propagated by the political theorists of the National Association of Manufacturers and others, tells us that 'federalism' is a good thing and very 'democratic,' because 'it follows that local government will be more interested in local problems, will prevent dangerous concentrations of power,' etc. This attitude stems from the political thinking of Jefferson and other early opponents of strongly centralized government who felt that the national government was the creature of the more powerful eco- nomic interests of the immediate post-revolutionary era. As representatives of the less wealthy elements in the population, they tried to minimize the powers of centralized government. Nevertheless, the direct heirs of the essentials of the Jeffersonian creed, Jackson, Wilson, and F. D. Roosevelt, have consistently con- tributed to the preeminence of the national government as opposed to the gov- ernments of the states. Beyond the United States, we find that Britain and France present examples of extreme 'centralism.' Power in both countries is concentrated in London and Paris ; the central governments are in all things supreme. In Soviet Russia, on the other hand, 'federalism' is so broadly applied that the constitution guarantees to each of the constituent republics the right to secede, the right to maintain a separate army and to employ its own diplomatic representatives. In Imperial Germany, in addition to separate armies and certain matters of foreign relations, the states which joined into the Empire administered most of the business of the Emperor through their own administrative machinery. From the viewpoint of governmental structure, Imperial Germany was about as loosely federated as the United States under the Articles of Confederation. Regardless of avowed structure, however, both Soviet Russia and Imperial Germany developed into notoriously centralized governments. Current American political influence in Germany, often exerted by New Dealers who were fighting against the prerogatives of 'States' Righters' at home, has been to incline the new Western Germany government toward 'federalism.' This influence has placed the control of the administration much more in the hands of reactionary landlords of Bavaria than would otherwise have been the case. The theory of the identity of class and party interests has, by similar reason- ing, led to the paradox of 'democracy* under the one-party system in Soviet Russia. Since, by Marxist definition, opposing political parties represent con- flicting class interests, it 'logically follows' that when socialism (which by defi- 19</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. VII, NO. 1 nition obviates class conflicts) is achieved, one party is sufficient to represent the one remaining class. Reviewing the evidence, we see that political maxims such as those justify- ing 'federalism* and centralism' have no meaning apart from a specific con- text. The same type of governmental structure can play into the hands of very different interests in different situations. Discussions about the 'intrinsic' merits of such structures are futile because no intrinsic merits exist. II. Physical Analogy Political phenomena are often explained by analogy to occurrences in the realm of physical science ; the analogy is offered and accepted as proof of the correctness of the explanation. The classic example of this type of reasoning is found in the story of the revolt of the plebs in the days of the Roman Republic. They returned to the service of their patrician overlords when told that, like human hands, they must work to supply food to the patricians, whose social indispensability was proved when they were compared to the human stomach, which human hands must feed if they are to continue living. Orthodox economic theory suffers from the physical analogy of equilibrium, as C. E. Ayers, shows so well in his Theory of Economic Progress.2 The bene- ficent effects ascribed to physical equilibrium by 18th century theorizers, specu- lating on the discoveries of Newton, are now often said to be present when demand and supply are 'in equilibrium.' Modern physics, of course, puts little faith in notions about 'natural harmony' which led to the belief in equilibrium for equilibrium's sake. But current economics has inherited this belief as a physical analogy and has neither brought it up to date by relating it to current physics nor recognized the basic fallacy of proving one theory by describing another. Currently, the most important physical analogy is that of the 'power vacuum.' Scholarly radio commentators and learned statesmen have explained the post- war world almost solely in terms of 'power vacuum,' that is, in terms of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. expanding into areas vacated by former powers (Ger- many, England, Japan, etc.). That the former two nations have vastly increased their influence and hegemony over other parts of the globe at the expense of defeated or weakened countries is obvious, but this fact has nothing to do with the differential pressures of fluids, as implied in the term 'power vacuum.' How, for instance, does the present status of Sweden, Finland, Austria, Yugo- slavia, Israel, or India fit into the concept of the 'power vacuum'? The danger of this figure of speech is that it leads to the notion that every corner of the earth must be in one sphere or the other, that no territory can be neutral and that no agreement is possible. On the other hand, what the evi- 2 C. E. Ayres, Theory of Economic Progress (Chapel Hill 1944) 65 ff. 20</page><page sequence="4">autumn 1949 PLOGGLIES AND POLITICS dence shows is that there is no blind physical force irresistibly polarizing the world, but rather that great powers sometimes do influence small countries, but sometimes they don't, and sometimes they can't. Reworded as 'Often large nations exert influence on small nations/ the phrase about Tower expanding into a vacuum' loses all of its grandeur, which was, after all, its only recom- mendation. III. Magic Words and Patterns It is believed that certain words , symbols or ceremonies will insure , merely by their presence in the system, either 'good' or r bad ' government . Many people have believed that proportional representation would guarantee good government. While the system no doubt has its merits, it appears to have helped rather than hindered the Nazis in their conquest of German de- mocracy. This is not the place to present extensive statistics on elections under the Weimar Constitution; it is my belief, however, that research among these figures will show that such effect as proportional representation exerted probably favored the Nazis, if it favored anybody. Among the symbols of 'good' government are constitutions, preferably with noble words inscribed therein concerning the dignity of man and his rights. Western Germany and Japan are now in possession of excellent examples of this sort of fetish and are consequently now 'democratic.' The general prevalence of these symbols on both sides in the cold war is so extensive, however, that much of their former charm is now lacking, at least in regard to their potency among nations on the other side of the struggle. It is well to recall here that the American Constitution is one of the shortest and simplest, and that Britain has none at all. Functioning constitutions are instruments of government, drawn up by specific groups to obtain concrete ends. They are rarely embodiments of abstract principles of government. When the language of a constitution so far transcends recognizable political reality as to consist almost exclusively of grandiose abstractions, one may be reasonably sure that its purpose is to obscure rather than to clarify the directions of intended political effort. Con- stitutions can give expression to political realities; they can never create them. IV. Incarnation Nations or institutions are often endowed with an animate and cohesive body of faculties. This phenomenon is usually obvious; the resort to a 'legal fiction' in law frequently involves these animate abstractions; large corporations and the na- tional governments are almost always so endowed and in many cases the slenderness of the realities on which such abstractions are based is so obvious that they are generally considered innocuous phantasies. 21</page><page sequence="5">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. VII, NO. 1 Such incarnate abstractions, however, are not always innocuous. They can lead to gross delusions and have severe repercussions. The concept of sov- ereignty in international law is one instance in which the consequences of 'in- carnation' are extremely serious. Sovereignty is spoken of as a quality which 'states' possess. In fact, the rather metaphysical conception of the 'state' seems almost entirely to depend on whether or not it can t&gt;e said to possess 'sovereignty.' The relation between sovereignty and the state is not unlike that between the body and soul of primitive man. Sovereignty, like the Trobriand Islanders' Baloma, or spirit, is apparently indestructible and lingers around the carcass of a defunct gov- ernment for a while and eventually enters a young government, infusing it with its own spirit and creating a 'state.' Some insight into the sacred nature of sovereignty can be found in the statement of the United States to the United Nations Trusteeship Council to the effect that in creating a trusteeship out of certain Pacific archipelagos, it would allow no international inspection, rule as it saw fit, but expressly would not assume 'sovereignty' over the islands in question. Its comic aspect aside, the belief in the indestructibility of 'sovereignty' is bound to have far-reaching and possibly violent consequences in Germany. In most of the standard works on international law, there appears to be only one method by which a victorious nation can occupy and police the territory of the vanquished; namely, belligerent occupation. Hyde's International Law describes this as follows: being 'essentially provisional,' [it] does not serve to transfer sov- ereignty over the territory controlled, although the de jure sovereign is, during the period of occupancy, deprived of power to exercise its rights as such.3 Hyde, a few pages on, comments on deprivation of property, suppression of political activity, transfer of territory, and so on, in this manner: If the occupant is guilty of such abuses and resorts to internationally illegal conduct in his treatment of persons or property within the district under his control, the de jure sovereign is believed to possess a solid right to demand full reparation upon restoration of peace.4 Codified reinforcement of Hyde's opinion (which is considered among the most authoritative in America) can be found in Article XLII of the Hague Treaty of 1907, which constitutes the regulations under which belligerent occupation is to be carried out: 'The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall [respect], unless 3 John Hyde, International Law, 1878. 4 Ibid., 1880. 22</page><page sequence="6">autumn 1949 PLOGGLIES AND POLITICS absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.'5 Article XXIII says that the occupant can not abolish or suspend the rights of nationals of the hostile party.6 Furthermore, there is a large body of precedent, dictum, and treaty stipulation in the United States which strongly backs all of these rigid limitations governing belligerent occupation.7 The most cursory investigation into the actions of military governments in Germany will clearly demonstrate that such regulations have no application to policies adopted there. Pieces of Germany have been given to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, France, Belgium, and Holland. Large numbers of people have been denied certain of their rights as citizens. Factories have been dismantled and hauled away. No German government exists and such local autonomy as is now exercised by the Western German Republic has been granted only under the strict regulations of the Occupation Statute, which leave no doubt as to who has the final say. Yet, so pervasive is the notion of the indestructibility of this essence of the 'state/ 'sovereignty,' that the occupying powers proclaim that Germany has been governed under the rules of belligerent occupation. There is a concept of international law, albeit a nearly obsolete one, which fits almost completely the course of action that the military governments in Germany have taken. Oppenheim's International Law labels it 'subjugation': 'Extermination in war of one belligerent by another through annexation of the former's territory after conquest, the enemy forces having been annihilated.'8 The use of 'subjugation,' however, as well as admitting the horrible fact that the sovereignty of Germany was destroyed on the same funeral pyre on which Adolf Hitler was cremated, would have involved applying a notion that has been nearly a dead letter since the era of imperial conquest petered out. It may be that the niceties of international protocol forbid the application to Germany of rules heretofore employed chiefly against African tribes. At any rate, none of the occupying powers ever hinted that 'subjugation' rather than belligerent occupation was in process. The inevitable repercussions of this failure to admit that Germany as a 'state' is as smashed as the Reich Chancellery should now be obvious. The Allies did not and could not treat a destroyed Germany under the rules of belligerent occupation; it was manifestly impossible. Yet they refused to admit that they were doing otherwise. When a new German 'state' does emerge "Article XLII, Mallo/s Treaties, II, 2288. 6 Article XXIII, Mallofs Treaties , II, 2285. As well as the references cited above, any standard treatise on belligerent occupa- tion will list some of the more important Supreme Court cases and other decisions on the subject. See, for instance, Ochoa v. Hernandez, 230 U.S., 139 if., on the taking of property without 'due process.' 8 Oppenheim, International Law, II, section 265. See VI, section 236, 'Conquest/ for further description of 'Subjugation' and what it implies. 23</page><page sequence="7">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. VII, NO. 1 from the ashes to assume its place in the community of nations, it will almost certainly be strongly nationalistic in character, and it will have a list, nearly unlimited in length, of charges of violations of the rules of belligerent occu- pation to press before such international courts as then exist against every one of the major victors of World War II. The effect that these charges will have at a time when the establishment of an international rule of law is of critical importance to the building of a peaceful world can only be guessed at. It will certainly not bring world government or enforceable international law any closer. I feel confident that, if asked whether he was aware of the difference be- tween a word and the thing it represents, any of the dignitaries involved in placing Germany under 'belligerent occupation' would reply, rather irritatedly perhaps, that he does not feel it necessary to answer such an obvious question. I have expressed the opinion that polarity in thinking is merely a primitive verbal habit. It is probable that the charm of thinking in polarities is due to the fact that simple motor attitudes can be expressed in this way. We turn to an object or we turn away from it, we may approach an object or run away from it. There are ex- tensor reflexes and flexor reflexes; we master the motions of bend- ing or stretching. We may swallow something or we may spit it out, but these are rather primitive actions and do not lead to a deeper appreciation of the outward world. To arrive at an understanding of a situation, such simple motor acts are insufficient. Languages have often taken over primitive habits of actions, and have built traps into which not only ancient Greek philosophers have fallen. . . . Only a small part of reality is captured by an established verbal habit. Most of the characteristics generally considered feminine and masculine have nothing at all to do with the actual difference be- tween the sexes. . . . We may be forced by habit to think in polarities, but this is merely a habit without regard for the real structure of things, and excusable only as a preliminary step in the explanation of the world. If one observes carefully enough, true opposites are not found. Thinking in opposites is only a hasty oversimplification. Paul Schilder, Goals and Desires of Man. 24</page></plain_text>
