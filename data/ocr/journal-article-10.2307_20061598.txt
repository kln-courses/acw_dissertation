Giuseppe Olmi, Lucia Tongiorgii Tomasi, and Attilio Zanca. Firenze: Leo S. Olschki, 2000. 626 pp. 69.71. ISBN 88-222-4870-8. Reviewed by: Daniel Brownstein, University of California, Berkeley This heterogeneous collection is the product of a 1996 conference organized around the theme of arts that visualize the natural world, held under the auspices of the Virgilian Academy of Mantua. While most of its essays focus on Italy, the collection has a broad Euro pean purview and extends from the early modern period to the present. Marc Fumaroli's prologue presents the volume as a reflection on a time when study of the natural world in art and science was rooted in mimetic practices, and art was used both to imitate nature's artifice and to promote its own mimetic claims.The most successful essays are focused stud ies; others survey changes in iconography over a longue dur?e.The lack of a tighter thematic focus or organization in such a multiauthored work makes the volume most useful for selec tive reading. The volume examines how techniques of imaging served to orient viewers to nature. The papers' interests can be grouped around several broad themes, some of which intersect. In his introduction, Fumaroli queries the relation of the recovery of the classics to the natural world, asking how a tradition of textual study both enriched the study of the natural world and replaced the decline of a frame of reference organized around universals.The relation of textual studies to iconography suggests one underlying theme of the collection. From an essay on the influence of classical rhetoric on a written vocabulary of color, to a discussion of the iconography of anatomical illustrations, to the role of the monstrous in images and texts, recuperation of ancient texts provided new grounds for scientific inquiry. The specific ways that images served as vehicles for the circulation of knowledge is a theme in the collection. An article by Peter Mason describes the translation of the New World into recognized iconographie forms from an art historical perspective; the contribu tion of Jos? Pardo Tom?s compares translations of Pliny's Natural History to the publication and diffusion of Oviedo 's images of New World plants ;TheaVignaue-Wilb erg's article links natural scientific illustrations to admiration of a divine artificer, a common theme of early modern science. Nelli-ElenaVanzan Marchini ties a revaluation of desire and luxury to how word and image compete to evoke physical presence in sixteenth-century medicine, poetry, and religious art. Philippe Morel examines how literature on natural monstrosities informed grotesque painting. In essays that emphasize the natural sciences, Enrico Baldini calls atten tion to Ulysses Aldrovandi s anthropomorphic illustrations of botanical monstrosities; the art historian Claudia Swan examines a painted herbarium that displayed biological and zoolog ical collections from Leiden; and Giuseppe Olmi offers a substantial study on the iconogra phies of artists who designed natural historical illustrations commissioned from artists from different parts of Europe by Luigi Fernando Marsigli, a Bolognese virtuoso who collected fine art and engravings and was a connoisseur of engraving techniques.The last two essays suggest how the images circulated in ways analogous to texts in a community of letters. A study of the relation between aesthetic, didactic, and disciplinary ends of illustrations is expanded in essays that concern biological and medical imagery. If Olmi describes images of animal anatomy, essays that concern parallel traditions of anatomical illustration in medi cine and art suggest how images create new communities of visualizing human anatomy. These studies are less defined. Dr. Loris Premuda surveys the role of graphic illustrations in surgical treatises through the Renaissance for didactic ends, with little variation from standard</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 885 medical histories. The iconography of the body is often translated between the worlds of art and medicine. Roberto Paolo Ciardi examines the use of anatomical iconography in Michel angelo and his followers, and suggests that Michelangelo focused on the anatomy of living bodies in ways that informed the functional anatomy of the surgeon Realdo Colombo; Mimi Cazort explores how the idealized bodies of eighteenth-century anatomical texts informed neoclassical art. The historian of science Renato G. Mazzolini examines how post-Mal phighian images of the skin's color informed a broad ideological context for discussing race in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Themes of medical and biological imagery inter sect in Matt Braunwalder's essay on the naturalism of images of the scorpion, Ernesto Zar s on images of parasites, and Mario Zancas on the iconography of allergens. In the wake of sustained work on the history of the natural sciences by such diverse early modernists as Paula Findlen, Steven Shapin, Thomas da Costa Kaufman, and Ludmilla Jordan ova, these essays forsake social or local contexts for systematic iconographie analysis. They treat images as aesthetic vehicles of knowledge. Yet each lifts corners on a blurring of nature and culture in attempts to rewrite a "book of nature." Although the essays'brief scope allows limited opportunity to explore local cases thoroughly, many stimulate questions about the ways images mediated knowledge. May the volume augur more closely grained studies of how representational practices and techniques shaped understandings of the natural world in early modern Europe.</page></plain_text>
