<plain_text><page sequence="1">T R A N S I T ION Position DESIGNER GODS David Rieff In December 1991, on the eve of the ter- centenary of the Salem witch trials, the editors of Ms. magazine sent their readers hearty holiday wishes whether the hol- iday in question was Christmas, Hanuk- kah, Kwanzaa, or the Wiccean festival of the winter solstice. We are used to this. Studied references to even the more ob- scure, minority tendencies in religion are now practically obligatory in the polit- ically correct press. Kwanzaa, for exam- ple, is a recent invention of African Americans eager to emphasize their Af- rican roots, which may or may not catch on sufficiently as to make a comparison with Christmas legitimate. But the win- ter solstice? That sounded like something out of the Anglo-Saxon past, not the feminist present. It turns out, however, that witchcraft and female shamanism are back, at least in some quarters in America, and that an enthusiasm for Goddess worship plays a growing role among people who wander across the borders of political feminism, the New Age movement, and ecological activism of the Whole Earth Catalogue variety. Such concerns are the mainstay of one important national publishing house, the religious imprint of Harper- Collins in San Francisco; occupy the at- tention of many students at such former bastions of the Protestant religious estab- lishment as the Harvard and Yale divin- ity schools and the Union Theological Seminary; and serve as a powerful part of the underlying ethos of the self-help movement as well. What was until re- cently an eccentric set of beliefs largely restricted to a few florid eccentrics in places like Santa Monica, California, where religious cults had always existed in larger numbers than anywhere else in the country, has now become, if not yet mainstream, at least influential. Witch- craft, which once seemed the stuff of Halloween masquerades and Disney car- toons, is now deemed intellectually re- spectable and, more importantly, hu- manly and socially admirable. Gloria Steinem's recent bestseller, Revolution From Within, contains a ring- ing defense of the traditional witches' coven of thirteen members as one intel- ligent model of how to create a "psychic family." For her, the coven is at least as valuable an example as any twelve-step group, affinity group, or other modern 20 TRANSITION ISSUE 59 Â© David Rleff, 1993</page><page sequence="2">I t I elective association. Indeed, the witches' decision to limit membership in each group to thirteen is particularly note- worthy for Steinem. "The healers and wise women of pagan times," she writes, "knew what they were doing when they made covens of thirteen witches-small enough so everyone could talk, large enough for diversity, and an uneven number so decisions were not dead- locked." It seems as if some mainstream feminists, at least those like Steinem who have been increasingly won over by the political arguments of the self-help movement (i.e., that it is not so much, as Steinem used to put it, that "the personal is the political," but rather that "the po- litical is the personal"), are developing the same sense of being descended from a society of witches as Communists in the early part of this century discerned a link between themselves and the early Christians. Some of what has to be called the growing spell of witchcraft over many politically committed women is frankly linguistic. A recent issue of a magazine called On the Issues, which dubs itself DESIGNER GODS 21 Julian Schnabel, Vita, 1983. Oil and bondo with plates on wood, 121/2 x 10". Photograph by Phillips/Schwab. Courtesy The Pace Gallery</page><page sequence="3">"the progressive women's quarterly," features a story called "Hunting Witches, 300 Years and Counting." In her editor's note, Beverly Lowy reminisced about living through what she described as Senator Joseph McCarthy's "witch- hunting frenzy" of the 1950s. From this evocation of the anti-Communist hyste- ria of that period, Lowy segued into the Salem witch hunts of the seventeenth century. "As long as there are people who don't play by society's rules," she concluded, "or who hold unpopular be- liefs or who are different in some way, there will be witch hunts." What is going on, however, is more than some sentimental cathexis in which witches are included in some sort of his- torical honor role of oppositional non- conformity, a list that would include not only Ethel Rosenberg but Sarah Good and Rebecca Nurse, two of the women Cotton Mather had hung at Salem. Witchcraft is only the most extreme ex- ample of the interest in heterodox spir- ituality that more and more people in the United States seem to find both more satisfying than established structures of belief-the mainline Christian denomi- nations, or even the mindset that right- wingers have tended to deride as "secular humanism"-and more politically ac- ceptable as well. Read the alternative press, and refer- ences to the Goddess are all but ubiqui- tous. The alternative weekly newspaper in Los Angeles, the L.A. Weekly, re- cently put out a special supplement called "Spirituality L.A." "Women- Centered Spirituality/Goddess Revival" was one of the first categories listed. Ac- cording to the Weekly's reporter, "god- dess worship is inherently linked to eco- feminism, as part of a system of values that metaphorically equates women's and the Earth's life-giving powers .... Some groups actually do worship the goddess or goddesses; some have rituals modeled on ancient patterns of wor- ship." What followed was a partial list of such groups in the greater Los Angeles There is a great deal of renaming in the Goddess movement, as there was in Zionism and is in much black nationalism area, but most major American cities and many university towns can boast their own Goddess-worship centers and fe- male shamans. It is a phenomenon that, however one judges it-to use an old- fashioned term that most modern peo- ple, and not by any means only femi- nists, would reject as, well, judgmental -is much more important than most people who have not been exposed to it can imagine. Certainly, on the left of the ecological movement, the Goddess is flourishing. The Spring 1992 issue of Whole Earth magazine was entitled "The Goddess Is Alive," and beneath a picture of a Pre- Cycladic fertility goddess advertised fea- tures on "healing Gaia," the name fem- inists and ecologists alike give to the "feminine" spirit of the earth; a shopping list of publications on witchcraft and Goddess worship; and stories like "The Goddess Remembered." Of course, what is usually meant by memory here is less retrospective than reinvention. As a self-proclaimed wise woman, Ann For- freedom (there is a good deal of self- 22 TRANSITION ISSUE 59</page><page sequence="4">renaming in the Goddess movement, as there was in Zionism and is in certain black nationalist circles) put it in an essay called "Feminist Witchcraft in Today's World," "As a religion, witchcraft fo- cuses on working with nature, on psy- chic development and on direct personal relationships with Diety (Goddesses, or Goddess and God). It emphasizes bal- ance, learning, and responsibility. As a pre-Christian, Goddess-oriented reli- gion witchcraft encourages female lead- ership, and many of its practitioners are feminists or sympathetic to feminism." For all the talk of mystery that goes along with the new witchcraft, there is really very little mystery about why this movement has gained adherents. Indeed, what is most remarkable about the God- dess movement to the outsider is the way its usefulness as a therapy, even more than its literal truth, is again and again brought up as the strongest argument in its favor. Above all, it seems to be a species of positive thinking. "Feminist witchcraft also offers positive ways It is a long way from the rites of matriarchal Europe to the "Goddess guild" of Malibu, California to view and change body images," For- freedom writes, and she goes on to say that it allowed her not only to "perceive the artist in myself" but also enabled her "not to be afraid of death." If that is true then it is a very great consolation, and one not lightly to be dismissed. And of course there is no question that insofar as the Goddess movement is one meta- phoric expression of the need so many people express today for "empower- ment," or, to put the matter in a more old-fashioned way, "autonomy," it is scarcely surprising that it has found its share of devotees. For the truth is that most people feel quite helpless-in cop- ing with society, with family, with ca- reer, with aging and mortality-and the Goddess movement at least claims to provide a way out of this helplessness. Gloria Steinem, inadvertently per- haps, was in this sense right to see the witches' coven as just another version of an experimental community. Certainly, for the urban and suburban women who are its constituency, the connection be- tween the actual history of witchcraft and their own lives and experiences has to be tenuous in the extreme. It is a long way from the rites of matriarchal Europe to "the Goddess guild" of Malibu, Cal- ifornia. And though witches may claim to have "rediscovered" these ancient roots, their language tends to be ultra- modern. Take Marilee Hartley, a self- proclaimed New York witch who is also a staffer in Mayor David Dinkins's of- fice. Hartley's coven is active in environ- mental causes. "We're spiritual urban guerrillas," she told a reporter from the New York Daily News, adding that "it's a challenge to remember your ancient ag- ricultural roots in the middle of the city." Of course, the reason that it is a "chal- lenge" is because it is impossible. One remembers one's childhood; one can only know about the past. And when that past, the matriarchy of pre-Neo- lithic times, has left almost no traces, the only possible way one can remember anything is to make up a history. The witches themselves predictably claim otherwise, and this notion of "thinking DESIGNER GODS 23</page><page sequence="5">with the blood," of an intuition that is contemptuous of reason and of neuro- chemistry, is one of the most worrying things about the Goddess movement. The witch Z. Budapest, acclaimed by many as the "modern-day mother of the feminist-witch movement" and star of her own cable TV show, "13th Heaven," was credited by one devotee, PegJordan, the founder of American Fitness magazine (thus do we solve the mind-body prob- lem), as "gifted with an uncanny sense of genetic memory." If this is to be taken at face value, we are in deep water here. For while most witches emphasize the notion of female witchcraft and Goddess worship as a means for contemporary female empow- erment, and often go to great lengths to insist that their intentions are notjust be- nign but downright redemptive, a call for ancient female principles to help heal a wounded earth, this talk of genetic memory has unpleasant overtones. It was, after all, not that long ago that an- other movement, one that also harkened back to Europe's pre-Christian past, held up the notion of racial memory as the antidote to the debilitating falsehoods of Jewish science and cosmopolitan, derac- inated reason. That movement was called Nazism, and its example is one that those who view the language, if not all the claims, of the Goddess movement, with indulgence would do well to keep in mind. To be sure, adherents of the Goddess movement have another agenda and an- other set of historical explanations. They are first of all concerned to expunge the bad name witchcraft has received over the centuries. This they attribute to the desire of patriarchal forms of social or- ganization to repress what an editor of Whole Earth magazine called "the mod- ern remnants of earth-centered reli- gions." Any association of witchcraft with Satanism or, for that matter, with any other malign intent, is viewed as a complete distortion. "Witchcraft," Z. Budapest has written, "isn't exotic at all. Witchcraft is the native religion of Eu- rope. It is basically a Goddess religion that centers on love and respect for the Earth and the power of women. When Christianity took over in Europe, it de- monized all these things. It made a de- mon out of the Goddess, and denigrated the Earth and woman. . . . The fact is, all our ancestors practiced witchcraft and the reason we don't know about it is be- cause we are alienated from our roots." Again, this is an idea with a pedigree. The assault on the preeminence of reason was a staple of Nazi thinking during the 1930s, as was the appeal to ancient agri- cultural roots, or, as the Nazis put it, "blood and soil." "The accomplish- ments of the mind," wrote the Nazi ideologue Hermann Burte in 1942, "tempt one into the delusion that every- thing in the world is to be arrived at exclusively through the mind." This is really not so very different from Ann Forfreedom's insistence that "feminist witchcraft encourages the development of intuition as an effective part of human life. Western culture denies the intuitive judgment, and favors a rational, logical, statistical, or factual approach." Let the buyer beware. The intentions of the Goddess move- ment could not, of course, be more dif- ferent. As Peg Jordan said of Z. Buda- pest, "She is filling the spiritual coffers of women so that the next important wave 24 TRANSITION ISSUE 59</page><page sequence="6">of social changes may occur .... She stirs the wind that gives women their voices once again." And this belief lies at the heart of why the Goddess movement has remained, for all its batty quality, im- portant to more mainstream figures and groups. People want to believe that be- fore some moment in time people lived in harmony with the world. They want to believe that their hopes and their sit- uations can be reconciled, that there is a way out of the ecological mess, of the war between the sexes, of even everyday unhappiness. And if that means harken- ing back to some golden time, why not? Americans, after all, have always been more interested in reinterpreting the past to suit the needs of the present than in taking the past, that most foreign of countries, on its own terms. So it is finally not surprising that when you dig through the more popu- lar works of respectable feminists and environmentalists you find quite star- tling points of rapport with the new Goddess spirituality. The bibliography of Steinem's Revolution From Within rec- ommends such standbys of the Goddess movement as Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade (described by Steinem as "using a prepatriarchal past to create a partnership future") and Monica Sjoo and Barbara Mor's The Great Cosmic Mother: Rediscovering the Religion of the Earth ("one of the few books on prepa- triarchal religions that includes their Af- rican origins"). Her book also carries a Wiccean epigraph at the beginning of one of its chapters and alludes matter-of- factly to the "killing of nine million women healers and other pagan or non- conforming women during the centuries of change-over to Christianity." This is the standard line of the new witchcraft. In fact, it doesn't hold up very well under close examination. The great European witch craze, which was indeed partly about men hating women, took place long after the Christianization of Eu- rope, and there is little reason to suppose that the Celtic societies that Christianity extirpated were less patriarchal. But to argue that the historical basis of these claims are weak (they are based on an almost entirely discredited book pub- lished in 1921 called The Witch-Craze in Western Europe), and, more importantly, that the logic is flawed in any case (if what matters is a changeover from ma- triarchy to patriarchy in Neolithic times, then surely the witches of early modern Europe were representatives not of this matriarchal past but of a pre-Christian patriarchal one), is to miss the point. What the Goddess movement, or the re- vival of witchcraft, offers is possibility. When witches talk about the excitement of chanting at a pro-choice rally, or even saying "oh, Goddess" rather than "oh, God," they are talking about reaching for a freedom, a heady new untrammeled sense of self, that is far more powerful than the caveats of academic historians on intellectual dangers inherent in such a fall into irrationalism. To believe in a golden past and, more centrally, in the power of individuals to reshape reality has always been the great appeal of magic. Why, in these dark and difficult times, should things be any different? The myths may be myths, in other words, but they are none the less liber- ating for that. People in America want to re- make their lives and their surroundings. More to the point, they have grown up DESIGNER GODS 25</page><page sequence="7">believing, if not in witchcraft, then at least that such magic will always be avail- able to them. They have always believed that they could design their own lives - think of Gloria Steinem's great phrase, explaining why she had never had a child: "I either gave birth to someone else or gave birth to myself"-so why shouldn't they design their own gods as well. And not the punishing, limiting The Goddess movement is, above all, a massive call for what Hollywood calls a rewrite God (male) of traditional monotheism, but a user-friendly God (female) whom one can love and identify with. "I found god in myself," wrote Ntozake Shange, "and I loved her / I loved her fiercely." The Goddess movement is, above all, a massive call for what in Hollywood they call a rewrite. At its most extreme, such a tendency is exemplified by a man called Brian Wren, a poet from Rome, Penn- sylvania, who, according to the Wall Street Journal, "travels the country giv- ing seminars in which he encourages people to 'brainstorm images of God.'" At one such event, a group of assembled ministers came up with such names as "Beautiful Movement," "Straight- Talking Lover," and "Daredevil Gam- bler," names which Mr. Wren promptly incorporated into hymns that he com- posed to mark the occasion. And all around the periphery of this revel are multitudes of more conven- tional Protestants equally yearning to be free, but not yet ready to doff the con- ventional symbols of their status- university appointments, say-for the ecstasies of witchcraft or the plunge into Goddess worship. A new license is all the rage in Protestant theological seminaries. Many of the mainline Protestant denom- inations are revising their liturgies to present a genderless God. A few minis- ters are using "She" rather than "He." As usual, theologians have arisen to de- fend these radical rewritings of Holy Writ as simple reinterpretations to suit the needs and views of our own time. "As society becomes aware of the issue of injustice," Professor Lety Russell of the Yale Divinity School told a reporter from the Wall StreetJournal, "the soci- ety's language has to change. The way to respect the original words is to retrans- late them as our understanding of their meaning changes." Rosemary Reuther, author of Sexism and God-Talk, has said that although patriarchal images pre- dominate, "there are critical elements in Biblical theology that contradict this view of God," and goes on to recom- mend the image of "the Goddess who is primal matrix." What is wondrous about all this-to a European, say, or even to an American Catholic-is that people like Russell and Reuther feel so blissfully free to operate within the context of institutional Chris- tianity, while demanding that its most sacred traditions be made over in a florid eclecticism. Even in America, people with the kind of critical bent these women share often leave the Church, ei- ther to found another or simply to opt outright for the wilder shores of heav- enly love. In one sense, this is the very American attempt to make Heaven a land of fun ("Daredevil Gambler," in- deed), freedom, and opportunity, to make a religion based less on the de- mands of spirituality than on the lan- 26 TRANSITION ISSUE 59</page><page sequence="8">guage and aspirations of both the civil rights movement and the self-help movement, from which contemporary feminism has borrowed so much. But this search for correct language, for a bet- ter story with a happier ending, for some promise of peace and fulfillment, is also a very American way in which well- intentioned people can express their de- spair at the way things have turned out with us. There is nothing mysterious about this denouement: an optimistic, salvation-crazed, satanically tempted people is bound to be also a melancholic, angry, frustrated, and finally despairing people. Look at Z. Budapest, or Ross Perot. So now let's look again at our cov- ens and shamans. To the convinced be- liever in Wiccean rites or Goddess wor- ship the world is in terrible shape. It is not surprising that, for all the surface op- timism, so many of the books proclaim- ing the Goddess or the possibilities of this The arguments of the Goddess movement are almost despairingly millenarian new witchcraft have apocalyptic subti- tles, phrases like "healing the earth," "reweaving the world," or simply "heal- ing the wound." In fact, the arguments of the Goddess movement are almost despairingly mil- lenarian. Again and again, its teachers insist that the planet stands at a turning point. Either some new (or, rather, very, very old) Gaian wisdom will prevail or else we are all doomed. In Shakti Woman, Vicki Noble uses the image of a planet that is like a body "suffering from terminal cancer." Another metaphor she employs is that of demons getting out of hand (it appears that female shamans believe in demons even if they consider the figure of Satan to be nothing more than a repressive patriarchal formula- tion). And Noble's response is devastat- ingly pessimistic. Her book concludes with lambent phrases: "Even if our death is imminent," she writes, "we need to join together and go out singing. I pray that the force for peace is stronger than it looks at the present moment and that the movement toward healing on this planet will ultimately prevail. Blessed be." In this sense, at least, the new female spirituality diverges from the more op- timistic mind-set of self-help and, for that matter, of conventional politics, and to their lip-smacking anticipation of metaphysical success adds a note of de- spair to the medley. When Vicki Noble talks of joining together and going out singing, she evokes images of a feminist Masada rather than the usual American grace note of the City on the Hill, at- tainable if we all work hard enough at both personal and societal self-trans- formation. And this, perhaps, is the per- fect American radical stance in this age of diminishing expectations. It is a commu- nal vision-the "joining together"-and an ecstatic one-the singing-and what it reveals more than the irrationalist fan- tasies of those who subscribe to it is this culture's inability to provide any rational basis for dealing with unhappiness or fin- itude. Maddened by freedom and inar- ticulable needs, people want more. Above all, they want a context for hewing to their vision of original inno- cence. For the UCLA archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, Europe in the Neo- lithic era was peaceful and harmonious, DESIGNER GODS 27</page><page sequence="9">untroubled by either exploitation or warfare. It was a "gylanic [a term writ- ers like Gimbutas use to mean neither pa- triarchal nor matriarchal], peaceful, sed- entary culture with a highly developed agriculture and with great architectural, sculptural and ceramic traditions." To this vision of the world that is rather star- tlingly reminiscent of Santa Cruz, Cal- ifornia, Vicki Noble adds her own ex- planation of the Fall. At a certain moment in human history, she writes, "real live men turned brutal and wiped out real live women-centered cultures." Before that epochal turning, however, "Goddess-loving people were able to in- vent everything we consider relevant to- day (except plastic and toxic chemicals) and live together in harmony with the earth." Since this is an account of the past that we would lose nothing (except pol- lution) by returning to, no wonder the motto of the Goddess movement can be summarized as "only reconnect." The relevant point is not that there is every- thing to gain, but that there is nothing to lose. Such mundane questions as what it would be like to live without access to modern dentistry are, predictably, never even mentioned. As is often the case with dreams of innocence, witches and Goddess wor- shippers account for its loss by telling of a traumatic event. Unlike some dream- ers, however, such as the Christian and Jewish interpreters of the Garden of Eden story, witches and shamans firmly reject the possibility that the Fall might have been a) fortunate or b) their fault. As No- ble writes, the men just "turned brutal," like a cell turning cancerous. Here, peo- ple like Noble are drawn in to some of our hoariest popular fantasies and para- noias. Noble herself apparently endorses the view, put forward by a writer named William Brantley, that the earth has "been colonized by UFOs and that war, famine, plague, and other unfortunate characteristics of modern society, which I call patriarchy, are part of the inten- tional design of the colonizers, whom he calls 'Custodians.' Their 'Custodial Re- ligions' (referring to all patriarchal reli- gions) have oppressed humanity since at least the time of the ancient culture of Sumer, first through kingship and reli- gious hierarchy and, in more recent his- tory, through secret societies up to and including the Masons." It would be pleasant to assume that people who endorse such vast conspira- cies only unwittingly intersect with, for example, the Nazis, for whom the Ma- sons were also a favorite target. A sense of one's own victimization, so ubiqui- tous among modern witches and God- dess worshippers, not only breeds its own totalitarian temptations but can en- gender a kind of recklessness about sources, assertions, and the sort of intel- lectual company one is willing to keep. The powerless often take refuge in con- spiracy mongering, as witness the per- vasive view in some sections of black America that the AIDS virus is part of a massive government plot to exterminate African Americans. And if the material circumstances of most Goddess wor- shippers are nowhere near so dire, their sense of their own beleaguerment is al- most as extreme. In these circumstances, the only hope is some species of divine intervention, or, at least, recourse to this brew of salvific, innocence-confirming, and com- munity-conferring myths. A Christian 28 TRANSITION ISSUE 59</page><page sequence="10">might discern in all this the occluded traces of the biblical promise of the Second Coming. But Christian or Wiccean, what the feelings that writers like Noble express really symbolize is an absolute disbelief that anything good can come out of society as it is presently con- stituted, and that only a complete trans- formation of everything will save us. So whether the female shamans have read too muchJung, or unwittingly absorbed too many ideas with their roots in fas- cism or the woolier theories of Joseph Campbell, is finally almost irrelevant. Reason has to be rejected in favor of in- stinct, technology and urban life in favor of an idealized vision of agriculture, magic, and harmony with the earth, be- cause there exists no possibility that any- one using the criterion of common sense or reason could possibly believe that these changes can occur. The choice, then, is between witchcraft and despair. Either we dream or we are doomed. And for all its seeming newness, this is an old American confusion. The Most of the established narratives that people over thirty-five grew up with have lost their coherence and moral force United States is a country where people have boasted of their refusal to distin- guish their dreams from realities. The whole ethos of the culture-a non- culture, really-is this cheery insistence that there are no limits on human poten- tial or the human capacity for self- transformation, and, as the old pop song had it, that "you can be what you wanna be." Add to this that the rise of myth mongering like that of the new witch- craft was predictable in a society where people feel desperately adrift, desper- ately disconnected, where whatever con- stitutes accounts of this society have stopped making sense, and something that initially seems as extreme as God- dess worship suddenly appears like a per- fect prism through which to look at the modern American dilemma. Why not take refuge in what a believ- ing Christian would have thought of as a heresy? The truth is that most of the established narratives that people over thirty-five grew up with in this country have lost their coherence and their moral force. Everything is up for grabs now. The country of two political parties, three television networks, two races, a dominant gender, and an even more dominant sexual orientation no longer coincides with the lives people live or the lives they see their neighbors living. In this sense, all the movements calling for the restoration of "family values," whether it is the pro-life movement or Vice-President Quayle inveighing against the TV show "Murphy Brown," can be seen as the effort of an orthodox America to hold the line-the story line-rather than assert truths that it con- fidently expects will be self-evident to everyone, just as all the oppositional movements, from ethnic studies move- ments on campus to the extreme edge of the new female shamanism, can be seen as calling less for a new politics than for a rewrite. The problem with the extreme ver- sion of this view as embodied in the God- dess movement-leaving aside all ques- tions of whether what it says is actually DESIGNER GODS 29</page><page sequence="11">true-is precisely that its barely con- cealed disdain for not only politics but the here and now generally leaves actual power in the hands of those who have always wielded it. Once one has posited a world in which we have effectively been living with the wrong ideas since the year 10,000 B.C., then indeed only miracles will make us whole again. But in the meantime, the world, terminally ill or not, goes on, and all the covens in San Francisco do not impede its prog- ress one iota. If the only way we are to survive is by returning to pre-Stone Age farming, or through Z. Budapest's incantations or Marianne Williamson's aptly named "Course of Miracles" (how many credits do you get?), then of course we will not survive at all. Or rather, since for all the apocalyptic talk, this is not the end of the world, we will not see our circumstances change for the better. Perhaps people prefer such a purist stance, prefer their fantasy of original, matriarchal innocence, their idea of na- ture that is as anthropomorphic and con- trived as anything in Bambi or Fantasia, and the childlike sense that if only the wicked patriarchs would get with the Goddess, or Gaia, or both, everything would be well in the biosphere. But though they may prefer it, such views are bound to lead to disappointment, just as the astonishing freedom of this culture has led to disappointment. The disap- pearance of the matriarchy thirty thou- sand years ago, or the eclipse of witch- craft half a millenium ago, does little to explain the real losses and the real con- flicts of our own time, whether a political tragedy like the Yugoslav civil war or a personal tragedy like the breakup of a marriage. Those are events that, outside the movies, don't change no matter how often you call for a rewrite. Americans, though, at the end of an era when they reigned over the world, will have trouble accepting this. It goes against the American grain. This new American magic is far preferable, far more palatable. You don't like the old hymns? Write new hymns. You don't like the Judeo-Christian God? How Gods cannot be designed like software or a new line of sports cars. There is history and there is fate about a loving Goddess? You don't re- spect technology? Well, do you believe in magic? It all works perfectly, save for the fact that gods cannot be designed like software or a new line of sports cars. There is history and there is fate. The real Wicceans were part of a Celtic culture that had come into being during the course of a millenium. Perhaps only an American could believe that the symbols of that culture could be appropriated, fused with everything from Hindu ideas of karma to American radical ideas of justice, and presented as a theology. For to say, as Americans have always said, that we need something new is not nec- essarily to say that we can have it or even that it is there for the having. And read- ing the books of the Goddess movement and the writings of our modern-day witches, one sometimes gets the feeling that the real desire is less for new gods, nonpatriarchal, user-friendly, and at least androgynous, so much as to be gods. That was the role that Americans in the twentieth century often thought 30 TRANSITION ISSUE 59</page><page sequence="12">they occupied in the world. And if it can- not be maintained in reality, why not cultivate it in dreams? There are precedents. The recovery movement speaks of helping people get in touch with their "inner children." The New Age movement claims that its ad- herents are able to find out who they were in past lives. Why should the God- dess movement be any different? As Z. Budapest puts it, her beliefs allow people to "commune with the goddesses and gods who are inside us." Or, in Ntozake Shange's words, well worth repeating again, "I found god in myself and loved her / I loved her fiercely." And it may be peculiarly American to believe that you can condemn the world and hope to re- deem it at the same time, but there are precedents for that too, dating back to the time when, for Europeans, America itself was not a real place but an idea, a place to allow one's projections to run riot. But the world is crowded now, and the real task that confronts us is to learn to live together, not to indulge ourselves in fantasies of redemption. Still, the fact that they are what draw us in steadily in- creasing numbers testifies eloquently to people's alienation and despair on this the eve of the millennium.
