<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LVII, No. 17 AUGUST 18, 1960 THE JoURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE NOETIC MODELS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY' THE question "What is metaphysics?" has aroused passionate debates, and so has the answer given in the last decades by the logical positivists. R. G. Collingwood sees in metaphysics the sci- ence of "absolute presuppositions"-i.e., of the presuppositions of science and even of civilization as a whole, tacitly accepted but changing with the types of science and civilization. This descrip- tion is itself metaphysical. In addition, the opposite idea might easily be advanced, that it is precisely metaphysics which is pre- supposed by a certain state of science and some degree of common- sense knowledge. Metaphysics would then be a reflection of factual knowledge carried beyond its limits. This seems to be the opinion of Karl Jaspers: "One could call philosophy a science insofar as the sciences are its presupposition. There is no tenable philosophy outside the sciences. . . . He who philosophizes presses for scien- tific knowledge because it is the only way to the authentic Non- knowing (Nichtwissen). . . . As modern science performs the great disenchantment, it gains the way to genuine depth, to the authentic mystery which is present in the fulfilled Non-knowing only through most decided knowledge." 2 As against Collingwood, Ferdinand Gonseth insists that "philosophy as the science of being and of principles aims at unconditional truth . . . the certainty of scien- tific judgments is not in every respect of that order. . .." 3 Jaspers obviously thinks that philosophy (i.e., metaphysics) begins where science ends, although the latter is the presupposition of the former. Collingwood 's definition may be linked to the humanistic sciences as the point of departure for metaphysics. This is less clear in Gonseth's definition, which might point to some 1 This paper is an emended version of a paper read at the Twelfth Inter- national Congress of Philosophy in Venice, 1958.

According to Franz Brentano, philosophy "surpasses all other sciences in theoretical interest." 4 It is, according to him, basically identical in its object with religion. But the latter is only a "surrogate" of philosophy, which has among the sciences the distinction of being called "wis- dom" (Weisheit). What is the object of this "theoretical inter- est" or " wisdom " ? " Theology develops a religious doctrine about the Divine, philosophy wants to give us a knowledge of it." 5 From a non-doctrinal viewpoint-i.e., historically speaking-metaphysics was not what is today called science but an inquiry concerning the objects of "theoretical interest" or what Paul Tillich would call the things of "ultimate concern," an investigation into two basic ques- tions of supreme interest to human beings at any time, namely: (1) What is the world around me? and (2) What is its destiny and my destiny, the destiny of my fellow-beings, within it? But these questions may be put in three different moods: (1) in a frightened, overawed mood which may be, perhaps, the religious mood, so that Brentano's identification of philosophy and religion may not be wholly wrong. The object may be the same but the mood in which it is approached differs. But according to Brentano "the whole talk about fear as origin of religion is highly superficial"; he rejects the statement, "timor fecit primos in orbe deos." (2) The second kind of mood in which these problems may be dealt with is the mood of rapture, characteristic of mysticism. (3) The third mood is the quiet, reflective one; and this is the approach of philosophy. The two basic questions mentioned above are interdependent, because, if one wants to know the destiny of the world and of man, he must obviously know the truth about them first. Psychologically speaking, the second question is the primary one, and the first one flows from the second. These two questions are obviously existen- tial in import, but they lead logically into an investigation of what the world "truly" or "really" is regardless of appearances, i.e., into an investigation of its "essence" or the true nature of being- i.e., into ontology. But if we form the concept of "appearance" as against "true reality" we become necessarily involved in questions of the limits of knowledge, etc. Thus, if the above mentioned two questions would 4 Franz Brentano, Religion und Philosophie, published posthumously in 1954 (Francke Verlag, Bern). 5 Franz Brentano, ibid., p. 91.</page><page sequence="3">NOETIC MODELS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY 547 constitute an exhaustive description of the invariant contents of metaphysics, doubts are bound to arise along with them as to our ability to answer them, owing to the limitations of our human con- dition. A new sort of inquiry is then born: epistemology. The epistemological question as to our ability was often denied with different degrees of emphasis, and this denial became also one of the sources of mysticism. The latest "great denial" was expressed by the neo-positivists. Every one of these denials proffers different reasons. The neo-positivists asserted the inanity of metaphysics on the strength of the mere analysis of the power and rules of language. However, there is a difference between the analysis of language and the analysis of the world. Quite recently Ernst Topitsch tried to cover all the anthropomorphic models of meta- physics.6 But whatever the original model, the fascination of the answer seems to inhere in the ever-changing elaboration of the models. These questions are perennial and will recur regardless of all strictures. If the faculty of thought carries a man beyond his own death and the death of his children, he will be inclined to reflect on his own destiny, the destiny of his progeny, of his nation, and of all men. As long as science has existed, in its technical or pre-technical phase, philosophers have availed themselves quite naturally of its lights in answering their basic questions; they have used the mate- rial proffered by science, but this has led to a certain desiccation of metaphysics and an ever more self-assertive attitude of science. Metaphysics was also bound to become thereby ever more intricate and complicated. At all times there have been scientific presup- positions of metaphysics. For Plato it was geometry, for Bergson it was the theory of evolution. The metaphysics of Whitehead certainly has a background of scientific knowledge. Philosophers are no "ignoramuses." A certain antagonism between science and metaphysics was also bound to develop, especially as scientists (for instance, physicists) started treating purely philosophical questions (for instance, causality), in which they did not excel. Metaphysi- cians, on the other hand, are apt to maintain that scientific knowl- edge is not "true " knowledge, since it cannot answer the two metaphysical questions-or, in fact, any questions of that kind- and even proudly declines to answer them. Science, on this view, lacks depth, insight, and is therefore a lower kind of knowledge. This is stated by Karl Jaspers in these words: " scientific knowledge is generally valid but only relatively to its method and presupposi- tions-philosophical truth is absolute for the man who asserts it 6 Ernst Topitsch, Vomn Ursprung und Ende der Metaphysik (Wien, Springer Verlag, 1958).</page><page sequence="4">548 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY within historical reality but its assertions lack general validity.... Philosophy is thereby not less but more than science, namely, the source of a truth which is inaccessible for scientifically compelling knowledge." "If I name, as object of philosophy, the whole, the world, being, then those words no longer denote any particular ob- ject, as philosophical critique shows. The philosophical methods are the methods of transcending objectivity (das Gegenstindliche). To philosophize is to transcend. . . . " 7 The scientists are likely to reciprocate such statements with the contempt born out of the possession of the only kind of efficacious as against imaginary knowledge. That metaphysics uses elements of existing knowledge is inevit- able. Otherwise it would seem dated and out of step with the times. We may ask, therefore: What are the noetic models of contempo- rary types of philosophy? Before answering this question one interesting fact should be stressed. Our two primary questions are in fact identical with the perennial inquiry into the nature of the true, the good, and the beautiful, described traditionally as the objects of metaphysics and philosophy. The latter description, however, is formalistic; i.e., it gives a formalistic answer to the original questions. If we want to know what the world really is like, we inquire into the nature of the "true"; but this does not disclose the material con- tents of this truth as the pre-Socratic still tried to do. As to the good, it is the way to influence our destiny in a positive direction, so as to guarantee the best possible outcome. To this extent this investigation is "practical"; it has a practical end which the inves- tigation into the nature of the world cannot have. But the answer is also formalistic because it does not describe materially the right way in question. Finally, looking at the world on our way to truth we are "contemplating" it and may then become struck by its "beauty"; we might even say then that we should immerse our- selves in this contemplation and stop asking further questions, as this beauty is the truth. This answer is also formalistic, as it does not disclose what this beauty consists in. These are, as it were, three formalistic answers of Greek philosophy to questions of fact not stated overtly, but implicitly. Christianity claimed to be able to give true material answers to these questions, and this unwaver- ing preciseness and conviction constituted its superiority over the Greek and Hellenistic world view of pagan philosophy. But in addition there was the optimism of those answers, compared with the deep pessimism of the ancient world. They promised eternal 7 Karl Jaspers, op. cit.</page><page sequence="5">NOETIC MODELS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY 549 life and eternal bliss after the short interlude of terrestrial exist- ence. Pliny, however, could entertain no such hopes. These three formalistic answers belonging to the realm of ontol- ogy are paralleled introspectively by the time-honored three facul- ties of traditional psychology: thought, will, and feeling, which also are related to our two questions. "Thought" is supposed to be a faculty able to find out the truth about the world and its destiny, ''will" is the faculty able to direct us on the right way to our destiny, while "feeling" shows delight or dismay at the state of the world, its beauty or ugliness. The limits of "thought" are shown by epistemology, its power by logic. Modern philosophy is split into three divergent camps and ac- cording to some writers even into four, a cleavage fraught with dangers to our civilization. To find an example of such radical cleavages we have to go back to the origins of modern philosophy or perhaps even to the pagan-Christian split. But according to some writers even this split did not touch the essential models of thought for philosophy. They remained unchanged; they even existed sometimes in succession within the mind of one man-for instance, St. Augustine. The basic dichotomy of the present time could be described as that between phenomenology and existentialism on the one hand and analytical philosophy on the other-the first of these prevalent on the continent of Western Europe, and its intellectual depend- encies, the second dominant in the English-speaking world, while dialectical materialism, as the third doctrine, holds sway in Eastern Europe and China. The origin of these divisions is partly and perhaps mainily political. Julius Kraft characterizes these philos- ophies in saying S that positivism (analytical philosophy) and phi- losophy of existence represent at present the "usus modernus" while Thomism and dialectical materialism represent the "usus traditionalis." Kurt Reidemeister was so impressed by this split that he sought 9 a common denominator from which analytical and existential philosophy could be brought together to a discussion which is now impossible from their own self-selected standpoints because they have no common language. As such a new stand he suggests that of "critical reason" to facilitate a "confrontation of viewpoints of analytic and hermeneutic thought." 10 "Under- standing" in the sense of the latter shows according to him "the 8 Julius Kraft, Von Husserl bis Heidegger (Verlag " Oeffentliches Leben, " Frankfurt am Main, 1957). 9 Kurt Reidemeister, "Prolegomena einer kritischen Philosophie," Pro- ceedings of the Second International Congress of the International Union of the Philosophy of Sciences, Vol. I, p. 46. 10 Ibid., p. 51.</page><page sequence="6">55G THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY spiritual value of things which lack that formal determinateness of things which physics states by means of measuring. " As an advocate of "scientific philosophy," i.e., as a positivistic philosopher, Hans Reichenbach would certainly reject a limine any such attempt as futile. To him "philosophical speculation is a transitional phase arising if philosophical questions are asked at a time lacking the means of answering them so that the history of philosophy is merely the history of errors. " 11 He also states that "philosophical systems have in the best case mirrored the state of scientific cognition but contributed nothing to the development of scientific knowledge." 12 He does not ask whether this was the purpose of metaphysical inquiry. He dismisses speculative philos- ophy as "speculative generalizations or poetic descriptions of the relations between man and world." He does not state explicitly whether he means by this also existentialist philosophy, but it is known that it was Heidegger's writings that Rudolf Carnap used as a textbook for showing that metaphysics is nonsense. Fritz Heinemann, however, notices 13 some similarity of stand- point between these two opposite camps in saying about existen- tialism: "Heidegger rebels against the metaphysics of the past. His position is similar and at the same time opposed to that of the logical positivists. He reaches similar rejections for opposite rea- sons. The logical positivists reject traditional metaphysics because its sentences are neither tautologies in a logical sense nor verifiable statements of fact. Heidegger rejects them because they are not the right kind of metaphysics. He rejects them as based on logic and rejects the latter as a foundation of philosophy, while the neo- positivists regard logic as fundamental. . . ." But, adds Heine- mann, Heidegger's viewpoint concerning the philosophies of the past is that of a counter-revolutionary looking backward rather than that of a revolutionary looking forward. Thus the whole similarity seems to consist in a rejection. However, the positivist rejection is predicated on the assumption that traditional specula- tive philosophy is not rational enough while Heidegger's rejection is based on the assumption that it was too rationalistic and too theoretical. We should add that dialectical materialism would join these two views in the rejection of traditional metaphysics to the extent that the latter are not preparatory of dialectical materialism and/or modern science. Heinemann notices that an existentialist could very well espouse both fascist and Marxist ideas. Whether "i Hans Reichenbach, Der Aufstieg der wissenschaftlichen Philosophie (Berlin-Grunewald, F. A.

(The Vienna Circle was politically close to socialism in the sense of a Labor Party ideology.) Julius Kraft, critical of both phenomenology and existentialism, which he considers in its ieidegger phase as a continuation of the former, thinks that Husserl's phenomenology found approval "as a constructive attack against positivism, sensualism and naturalism of the 19th and 20th centuries . . . there arose for positivism a serious adversary because of its apriorism. . . . * 14 He calls existentialist phenomenology "an irrationalistic final link (Endglied) of the phenomenological attempt at a renewal of systematic philosophy." In my opinion the basic cleavage between analytic philosophy on the one hand and phenomenology and existentialism on the other is due to a difference of the noetic models behind them. The models of the former are mathematics and physics; the models of the latter are the humanities (Geisteswissenschaften), especially history, soci- ology, and psychology. The investigative methods of these two types of philosophy are abstracted from these two types of science. This is why a synthesis between them seems so difficult. They seem to deal with different aspects of life-analytical philosophy with the intellectual aspect and existentialism (but also post-Husserl phe- nomenology) with the emotive aspect. Being antithetic in their methods, they are complementary in subject matter and results. They seem to deal with different problems, and each of them gives only a partial answer. The Oxonian type of analysis in our time gets sometimes dangerously close to the existentialist investigation of language by Heidegger. To Heidegger "the mathematical" is the "rigid frame" of non-authentic knowledge and its fulcrum is apriority. The existents are supposed to fit into this preestablished frame, and this is what "scientific rigor" consists in. In other words, the mathematico-physical framework is aprioristic and its formalism ontologically unrevealing. While analytic philosophy attacks our two original questions obliquely and mediatingly: What can we reasonably say about the world? and reaches a sceptical conclusion on the basis of the anal- ysis of language, existentialism tackles those problems directly and passionately, purporting to employ the phenomenological approach and the hermeneutic method, i.e., the method of intuitive apprehen- sion and of understanding insight. But they are of psychic origin and aim at a psychological meaning. There is also a difference of intellectual style between the two, which could perhaps be described in such way that there is an affinity of style between analytic philosophy and modern functional style in architecture. As for 14 Von Husserl bis Heide.q.er, p. 144.</page><page sequence="8">552 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY existentialism, its intellectual complexion antedates the first world war and was first observable in literature. (It reverted to it in France.) The Viennese poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal wrote in 1907: And at the same time something trembled within me . . . something that split my breast like a breath, an indescribable afflation of eternal Nothingness, of eternal Nowhere, a breath not of Death but of Lifelessness, indescribable . . . it lay here so inane-so ghostly inane. . .. Their buildings, their monuments, their streets, this all was in that somewhat visionary moment to me nothing but the thousandfold played grimace of their ghostly non-existence. . [Hugo von Hofmannsthal, "Briefe der Zuruckgekehrten" (Letters of the Returned) in Prosa II, 345 ff., Frankfurt am Main, 1951.] This clearly foreshadows the analysis of existence by Heidegger. This is the mood of the end of an era, and it is duplicated in other great writers of that time such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, and in the "pittura metafisica" of Chirico. These moods might have had their root in the emotionally unsatisfactory results of natural science. Franz Brentano reports in his post- humously published writings: 15 Helmholtz says that he could resign himself if need be to the idea of his individual end if he had at least the consolation that not everything for which he toiled during his whole life would also perish; but he does not conceal from himself that there is no such prospect without personal immortality because we must count with assurance on the destruction of our planet. But when all this is said, it should be stressed that the dread of nothingness, of finitude, and the desire for a life eternal are not necessarily symptoms of pessimism; they are rather the opposite. Genuine pessimism is visible rather in the melancholy statement of Kant to the effect that no reasonable man would, after reflection, like to relive his life, or when Pliny says that the greatest consola- tion in life is the fact it most certainly ends and that death is eternal. Schopenhauer repeated Kant's statement as a proof of life's disvalue. As for Marxism and existentialism, they deal with related matters but in a different vein. The noetic models of dialectical materialism are also the humanities, namely, economics and/or sociology and history, conceived physicalistically as natural sciences and not as humanities (Geisteswissenschaften) as is the case in existentialism and phenomenology. Thus they are diametrically opposed in their attitude toward those sciences. Dealing with a similar subject matter, they are mutually exclusive in outlook: existentialism is asocial and individualistic, while dialectical mate- rialism is social and society-minded. The former psychologizes 15 Franz Brentano, op. cit., p. 246.</page><page sequence="9">NOETIC MODELS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY 553 solipsistically about existence and its meaning, while the latter rejoices naturalistically in the social status of man. Society- minded Marxism may express dissatisfaction with a certain type of society, but existentialism abhors society as such; it sees in the social way the road to perdition. It expresses its dissatisfaction from a personal, lone-wolf, individualistic, asocial point of view. Being ostensibly dissatisfied with the human condition as such, existentialism deprecates the past, the present, and the future; while Marxism, rejecting only a certain kind of social order, espouses optimistically another one full of promise, envisioned in the near or distant future. It is of course difficult to reconcile these two kinds of dissatisfaction. But let me mention here that the mood of nihilism in existentialism is by no means traceable only to the Christian nihilism of Kierkegaard; but it also owes something to the atheistic nihilism of the latter's contemporary, Max Stirner (Kaspar Schmidt), less respectable in German university circles as an atheist and a poverty-stricken gymnasium teacher, while Kierke- gaard was the wealthy, pseudo-Christian faineant and framer of paradoxes. Kierkegaard achieved his notoriety in Germany before the first World War. He conformed to the mood of spiritualism and mysticism then in vogue. But both Stirner and Kierkegaard were the authentic heirs of the literary Romantic "Weltschmerz" and the nihilistic rebels against Hegel's Reason. Julius Kraft considers Thomism as the fourth basic type of con- temporary philosophy. Thomism is easier to reconcile with phe- nomenology-it is rather a method than a world view,-and even with existentialism, due to the latter's basic dissatisfaction with the human condition in mortal life; they have a common "me- mento mori," but Thomism is rationalistic and existentialism ir- rationalistic. Analytic philosophy is among all these types, intellectually speaking, the most aristocratic-far more so than existentialism. In its aloofness it seems to be free from all social involvements, while existentialism blares forth human woes raucously and without restraint. As the former lives in the rarefied air of formalistic, abstract speculation, mildly resigned to its logico-symbolical opera- tions, it has been described variously as escapist or generally un- satisfactory, since it "abdicates" before the problems of human concern. To Marxism this detachment is anti-social and downright reactionary. To others its neutralism in ethics is a grave deficiency in times of crisis. Any philosophy that has its noetic model in the humanities- and this is true not only of phenomenology and existentialism but also of neo-Thomism-has an inclination toward epistemological</page><page sequence="10">554 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY idealism. Despite their assertions to the contrary, phenomenology and existentialism are late outgrowths of idealism, and so is any ontological speculation on being and non-being; these are idealistic terms derived from introspective mentalistic concepts. If this analysis does not fit Marxism, it is because of its special Janus-like position in that it considers the humanities as natural sciences. With this is connected another trait: philosophies with their noetic model in the humanities are inclined to employ the introspective method because it is of basic importance in this type of sciences-at least according to those philosophies. It is debatable whether history or other social disciplines can really be fully understood without some overt or covert recourse to introspective elements, owing to the fact that human motivations, which are of great weight in these disciplines, are hardly accessible without introspection and analogy. Mathematics and physics, which investigate relationships or structures of the outside world, not motivations, can dispense with introspection. A basic cleavage will then arise between philos- ophies derivable from mathematico-physical models, such as ana- lytic philosophy, and their counterparts-existentialism and phe- nomenology. Kant may be said to have united in his mind the two kinds of noetic models. In his theory of knowledge he used models derived from mathematics and physics, in his ethics and esthetics the noetic models of the humanities. As a "theoretical" thinker he was therefore an "analytical"' philosopher, but he was an idealistic metaphysician in the theory of ethics and esthetics. From its beginnings philosophy has oscillated between Meaning and Measure as the two principles of explanation of the world. These principles are disparate, since meaning is drawn from inside, from the world of desire, from sensibility that alone confers "mean- ing" on things and events. Measure cannot achieve this, being always an analysis of external facts and structures. It is true that sizes sometimes seem to assume meaning (for instance in sublimity), but even here it is self-awareness that confers it by some process of comparison and reflection. Being extrospective in character, meas- ure can only generate other measures. In our time analytic phi- losophy is a creation of measure, while phenomenology and existen- tialism are formations of meaning. They diverge in direction. The Pythagoreans tried to confer meaning on measure. Anaxagoras and ileraclitus were the first to lay heavy stress on meaning. In Aristotle and Kant the two elements are fairly balanced. Today the cleavage is complete. MAX RrSER NEW YORK CITY</page></plain_text>
