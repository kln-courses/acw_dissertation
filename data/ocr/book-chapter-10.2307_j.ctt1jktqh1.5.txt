D. Traill claimed that ‘not to be new is, in these days, to be  nothing’.3  Other notable examples of  the vogue of  the new are the New Spirit, the New  Drama of  Ibsen and, of  course, the New Woman. It is not surprising then that a ‘new  geometry’ would appeal to this generation of  writers and thinkers.4  It is in this context  that we should consider Charles Howard Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, which was  fi rst fully expressed in A  New Era of  Thought (1888). In this book he promised to ‘bring  forward a complete system of  four- dimensional thought – mechanics, science, and art’.5   While Hinton did not live to complete this system, his belief  in the applicability of  ‘four-  dimensional thought’ across multiple discourses was appropriate: the history of  the con- cept of  the spatial fourth dimension is a history of  movement. It is also part of  the shared  history of  modernism.   The rise of  non- Euclidean geometry in the second half  of  the nineteenth century  served to emphasize the contingency of  even mathematical knowledge, pushing debates  about the relativity of  knowledge to the forefront in a way that must have been particu- larly distressing for conservative thinkers. Euclid’s axioms, which had remained largely  uncontested for nearly two thousand years, were no longer sacrosanct. ‘The argument  concerning the relativity of  knowledge is absolutely necessary to the emergence of  mod- ernism,’ Gillian Beer correctly explains, fi nding ‘the cognate confusion between method  and fi ndings’ in late Victorian mathematics and physics particularly suited for uncovering   1  Pound fi rst used this phrase in T he Cantos . However, he borrowed this slogan from Cheng Tang,  the founder of  the Shang dynasty. Thus, while this phrase is associated with an earlier ‘break’  with the past, it is also a call for renewal, or recurrence with variation.

The New Geometries   In  The Fourth Dimension and Non- Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art , Linda Dalrymple Henderson  connects the shift from high Victorian realism to more abstract forms of  art, generally  described as modernist, to a similar shift in late nineteenth- century geometry.7  However,  more was at stake in the challenge the new geometries presented to Euclid than aesthetics or  mathematics. Alice Jenkins has uncovered the hidden dimension of  class politics in Euclidean  geometry, noting how in the early nineteenth century ‘mathematics held an immensely privi- leged status in the European concept of  education, and at the root of  its status lay the clas- sical study of  geometry’.8  Knowledge of  classical languages and higher mathematics was  the hallmark of  the Oxbridge- educated male, and debates around the utility of  Euclidean  geometry in education and the applied sciences were necessarily underpinned by questions  of  class. At the polar ends of  this debate were the classicists, who argued that the study of   geometry was fundamental for developing the faculty of  reason, and those who argued that  the importance of  higher mathematics in education and culture was greatly overemphasized  by the privileged classes. ‘In between these two positions’, Jenkins observes,   were more moderate views which broadly supported the study of  geometry but sought to  divest it of  its aura of  privilege and inaccessibility by teaching in such a way as to emphasize  practical rather than abstract reasoning (and thus, to the adherents of  the Euclidean method,  denuding it of  most of  its benefi t to the learner).9    Educational reform debates continued into the second half  of  the century, and it was  clear which side was winning when T. H. Huxley began to emphasize the importance of   early education in the physical sciences over abstract mathematics. In his address to the  Liverpool Philomathic Society in 1868 (later published in M acmillan’s Magazine ), Huxley  lamented the lack of  practical scientifi c training in primary and secondary education.  According to Huxley, the wealth and health of  the nation depend on early scientifi c  training, and this training must be practical, not abstract, ‘bringing [...] the mind directly  into contact with fact, and practising the intellect in the completest form of  induction;  that is to say, in drawing conclusions from particular facts made known by immediate  observation of  nature’.1 0 The study of  mathematics would not off er the same kind of     6  Beer, O pen Fields , 303.    7  Henderson, T he Fourth Dimension , 98.    8  Jenkins, S pace , 166.    9  Ibid., 167.   10  Huxley, ‘Scientifi c Education’, 182.  </page> <page sequence="5">    21  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 21 discipline:  ‘mathematical training is almost purely deductive. [...] There is no getting  into direct contact with natural fact by this road’.1 1   With the tide turning in favour of  practical scientifi c training, mathematicians such  as James Joseph Sylvester sought to defend mathematical training by adapting and sub- verting Huxley’s argument. The classicist Euclideans were losing the battle: in his 1869  address to the Mathematical and Physical Section of  the British Association for the  Advancement of  Science (BAAS), even Sylvester claimed he would like to see ‘Euclid hon- ourably shelved or buried [...] out of  the schoolboy’s reach’.1 2 Nevertheless, he directly  challenged Huxley’s claim that ‘mathematical training is almost purely deductive’:   Mathematical analysis is constantly invoking the aid of  new principles, new ideas, and new  methods, not capable of  being defi ned by any form of  words, but springing direct from the  inherent powers and activity of  the human mind, and from continually renewed introspection  of  that inner world of  thought of  which the phenomena are as varied and require as close  attention to discern as those of  the outer physical world [...]: that it is unceasingly calling  forth the faculties of  observation and comparison, that one of  its principal weapons is induc- tion, that it has frequent recourse to experimental trial and verifi cation, and that it aff ords a  boundless scope for the exercise of  the highest eff orts of  imagination and invention.1 3   The shift in tone is subtle but important: within this plea for the recognition of  the value  of  introspection in scientifi c education, Sylvester adopts the very terms of  Huxley’s argu- ment that inductive reasoning is superior to deduction. Its place no longer assured in the  highest reaches of  intellectual respectability (or the foundations of  educational training),  mathematics is legitimized here as an analogue to the natural sciences: Sylvester even  went so far as to describe Arthur Cayley as ‘the central luminary, the Darwin of  the  English school of  mathematicians’.1 4   We should consider Hinton as an inheritor of  this shifting debate: although the fourth  spatial dimension was accepted by most reputable mathematicians and scientists as  purely theoretical, Hinton argued for the discernment of  higher space through practi- cal training. His hyperspace philosophy, although dealing with what many would call  abstract space, was the product of  these attempts to emphasize the practical applications  of  geometry and confusions arising from the increasingly specialized and abstract nature  of  mathematical, particularly algebraic, discourse. Sylvester’s address demonstrates how  the climate was ripe for the confusion of  abstract terms with practical applications. After  lamenting that even ‘authorized’ English writers such as William Whewell, G. H. Lewes  and Herbert Spencer confl ate the terms ‘reason’ and ‘understanding’, or ‘Vernunft’ and   11  Ibid.   12  Sylvester, ‘A Plea’, 2: 261. Sylvester clarifi es that ‘I have used the word mathematics in the plu- ral; but I think it would be desirable that this form of  word should be reserved for the applica- tions of  the science, and that we should use mathematic in the singular number to denote the  science itself ’ (262).   13  Sylvester, ‘A Plea’, 1: 237.   14  Ibid., 238.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 22 22 BEFORE EINSTEIN  ‘Verstand’, Sylvester celebrated the unifi cation of  the ‘matter and mind’ of  the various  branches of  mathematics:   Time was when all the parts of  the subject were dissevered, when algebra, geometry, and  arithmetic either lived apart or kept up cold relations [...]; but that is now at an end; they  are drawn together and are constantly becoming more and more intimately related and con- nected by a thousand fresh ties, and we may confi dently look forward to a time when they  shall form but one body with one soul.1 5   Hinton’s fourth dimension arose from the confl ation of  algebraic terminology and  descriptive geometry. For example, in seeking to fi nd the geometric fi gure corresponding  to x 4 , Hinton coined the term ‘tesseract’, indicating a four- dimensional analogue to the  cube, or x3  .   When Hinton came of  age, non- Euclidean geometry was just reaching popular scien- tifi c discourse. Although non- Euclidean geometry was simultaneously and independently  ‘discovered’ by Johannes Bólyai and Nicholai Lobachevskii in the 1820s, it did not enter  mainstream mathematics in Britain until 40 years later. At this time in curriculum reform  debates, the classicist Euclidean method was under attack. Jonathan Smith observes:   In a country where a staple of  education from the lower forms to the universities was the study  of  Euclid’s E lements , the development of  diff erent geometries and the contention that space  may not be Euclidean and three- dimensional could not help but capture public attention.1 6   Smith’s grouping of  Euclidean and three- dimensional geometry also illustrates the way  the public confl ated non- Euclidean geometries with the theory of  the fourth dimen- sion. From the 1870s onward, a growing body of  specialist and popular literature that  addressed the new geometries often combined the concepts of  the fourth dimension  and  n - dimensional spaces with non- Euclidean geometry. Although the possibility of    n- d imensional spaces was only one idea raised within specialist discussions of  non-  Euclidean geometry, it soon became representative of  these new geometries to popular  audiences. For many, the concept of   n dimensions itself  was understood as the theory of   the fourth dimension of  space. While most specialists understood the diff erence, as K. G.  Valente has shown, these mathematicians often unintentionally implied a relationship  between non- Euclidean, curved models of  space and the fourth dimension. Hermann  von Helmholtz, W. K. Cliff ord and other mathematicians,   as part of  their mission to disseminate radically new geometric epistemologies to a wider  audience [...] often asked their readers to contemplate the limited understanding that beings  living on the two- dimensional surface of  a sphere would have of  the curved geometry of  their  world [...]. This illustrative scenario was meant in part to show how one could understand- ably mistake our space as Euclidean [...] based on small-s cale experiences or observations.  It gave rise, however, to a commonly held misconception [...]. Consequently, promoting   15  Ibid., and Sylvester, ‘A Plea’, 2: 262.   16  Smith, F act and Feeling , 180.  </page> <page sequence="7">    23  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 23 non- Euclidean or Riemannian models of  space in the 1870s simultaneously, if  unintention- ally, served to draw attention to the fourth dimension. 17   In this way, the fourth dimension came to be associated with both non- Euclidean geom- etries and n  - dimensional geometries.   N - dimensional (or sometimes, ‘p  - dimensional’) spaces had more or less than three  dimensions and were considered to be purely analytical and abstract by most mathema- ticians and scientists. The potential for reifi cation of  these terms occurred in the shift  from the analytical language of  algebra to the more descriptive language of  geometry.  In her study of  Victorian geometry, Joan Richards explains this diff erence: ‘Geometrical  arguments are clearly more descriptive than analytical [algebraic] ones. To argue that a  proof  involving circles requires a conception of  space is much easier than arguing that  an analytical demonstration involving a  and  b requires an understanding of  number.’ 18  The concept of  the fourth dimension of  space grew out of  a slippage between these dis- courses; it was the result of  a hypostasization of  abstract symbols such as x4  .   The potential for such slippage was present in the writings of  Victorian geometers, as  Richards shows in an example taken from an 1866 essay by the mathematician George  Salmon, ‘On Some Points in the Theory of  Elimination’:   The question now before us may be stated as the corresponding problem in space of  p  dimen- sions. But  we consider it as a purely algebraical question, apart from any geometrical considerations. We  shall however retain a little of  the geometrical language, both because we can thus avoid  circumlocutions, and also because we can more readily see how to apply to a system of  p   equations, processes analogous to those which we have employed in a system of  three. 19   In this passage, Salmon was specifi c that he was not referring to an actual space of  p   dimensions; rather, he was considering a purely formal problem. For him, the language of   descriptive geometry was simply a matter of  convenience. However, Richards observes,  although Salmon was clear that ‘he was just using a fi gure of  speech [...] Cayley was less  explicit on this point’.2 0 This ambiguity on Cayley’s part did not pass unnoticed by other  British mathematicians. In his 1869 address to the BAAS cited above, Sylvester actually  made the jump from an abstract treatment of  n  dimensions to a suggestion of  the ‘reality  of  transcendental space’ of  four or more dimensions.2 1   As Richards notes, Sylvester’s support for the reality of  higher spatial dimensions  was ‘rather circuitous’.2 2 Rather than attempt to illustrate his own conception of  four or  more dimensions, Sylvester cited Gauss and Cayley as key supporters. Additionally, in a   17  Valente, ‘Who Will Explain the Explanation?’, 130.   18  Richards, M athematical Visions , 39.   19  Salmon, quoted in M athematical Visions,  54, emphasis added.

If  Gauss, Cayley, Riemann, Schalfi , Salmon,  Cliff ord, Krönecker, [s ic ] have an inner assurance of  the reality of  transcendental space,  I strive to bring my faculties of  mental vision into accordance with theirs. 23   Embedded within this gratuitous name- dropping is a circular sort of  logic, a fi nessing of   the absence of  origin in line with Baudrillard’s simulacrum, ‘the generation by models  of  a real without origin or reality’ that results in ‘a hyperreal’. 24 To understand how the  fourth dimension moved from being a fi gure of  speech in analytical geometry to hyper- real hyperspace, we must consider fl atland narratives of  lower- dimensional spaces, or,  what is more appropriately called the dimensional analogy.   The Dimensional Analogy   The dimensional analogy begins as a thought experiment, where the writer asks the  reader to imagine a fl at or two- dimensional world complete with living, intelligent, two-  dimensional beings, in order to then imagine the relationship between our world and a  four- dimensional one.  The most famous of  dimensional analogies is the one expressed by  Edwin Abbott in his 1884 novella, F latland: A Romance of  Many Dimensions .  Flatland serves as  a useful point of  reference – although the fi rst example of  a dimensional analogy in print  was Gustav Theodor Fechner’s semi- comical essay ‘Der Raum Hat Vier Dimensionen’ in  1846, Abbott’s is the most popular (and detailed) treatment of  the dimensional analogy  within an individual text.   Flatland is divided evenly into two parts. The fi rst part of  this text, titled ‘This World’,  develops and represents this two- dimensional world; the second part, titled ‘Other  Worlds’, completes the analogy by exploring the relationship between Flatland and worlds  of  other dimensions, such as Spaceland, Lineland and Pointland. Thus, the entire text  of   Flatland is dedicated to working out the dimensional analogy. The dimensional anal- ogy is important for two reasons: fi rstly, because it is a recurring trope in all hyperspace  philosophy and popular four- dimensional fi ction I have encountered. Indeed, the trope  is so familiar to the subject that by 1910, Paul Bold, in his short story ‘The Professor’s  Experiments’, had refi ned it down to a brief  explanation from the titular professor:   Well then, in the fi rst place we exist in a land of  three dimensions – length, breadth, height –  and we can ordinarily conceive of  no extra or fourth dimension. But we can conceive of   beings in the  lower dimensions, and a being in two dimensions would know of  length and  breadth, and would have no conception of  height; planes or plane surfaces would be the  limit of  his knowledge, and the third dimension would be as unthinkable to him as the fourth   23  Sylvester, ‘A Plea’, 1: 238.   24  Baudrillard, S imulations , 2.  </page> <page sequence="9">    25  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 25 dimension is to us. Again, a being in one dimension would only know of  length; both breadth  and height would be unthinkable. Do you follow? 25   That the professor is able to relay the dimensional analogy so briefl y is a testament to the  familiarity of  this device by the early years of  the twentieth century.2 6   Second, the dimensional analogy is important because for hyperspace philosophers  such as Hinton, it is the device through which the spatial fourth dimension is actually   created . For those who did believe in the material existence of  a higher dimension, the  dimensional analogy was not only the means by which this idea was communicated; it  was an important tool in locating, describing and even experiencing hyperspace. This is  why, although it deployed the dimensional analogy and addressed the fourth dimension,   Flatland is most accurately situated outside of  hyperspace philosophy. As was recognized  by some of  his contemporaries – and more recently by literary critics – Abbott was not  as concerned with popularizing the fourth dimension here as he was with satirizing con- temporary English culture.2 7   Additionally, some critics have read F latland as a result of  the Reverend Abbott’s  ‘opportunistic desire to reconcile science and theology’, in utilizing the challenge to sci- entifi c materialism off ered by the new geometries.2 8 As Hinton wrote in 1885, he would  have liked to recommend the dimensional analogy of  F latland to his readers as an instruc- tive example, but   turning over its pages again, I fi nd that the author has used his rare talent for a purpose for- eign to the intent of  our work. For evidently the physical conditions of  life on the plane have  not been his main object. He has used them as a setting wherein to place his satire and his  lessons. But we wish, in the fi rst place, to know the physical facts.2 9   Here Hinton underlined the key diff erence that he saw between his work and  Abbott’s: Abbott deployed the analogy of  a two- dimensional world to direct the read- er’s attention to the social conditions of  our own, three- dimensional world. Hinton, by  contrast, wanted to us to consider ‘the physical conditions of  life on the plane’ as a  means to fi nding a strategy for perceiving, ‘perchance a help to the comprehension of  a  higher life’ in ‘the mysterious minute actions by which [we are] surrounded’ in our three-  dimensional world.3 0 Hinton used analogy to hypothesize and make observations about   25  Bold, ‘The Professor’s Experiments’, 257, original emphasis.   26  See also Manning, ed., T he Fourth Dimension Simply Explained . The majority of  these essays rely –  explicitly or not – on Hinton’s work. In fact, Einstein used a refi ned version of  the dimensional  analogy to explain his own theories the nonscientifi c reader in 1938. See Einstein and Infeld,   The Evolution of  Physics .   27  For nineteenth- century critics see Tucker, ‘Review of  “Flatland” ’; and Hinton, below; for  recent literary criticism that addresses Abbott’s use of  satire, see Jann’s introduction to F latland ,  vii– xxxiii; and Smith, Berkove and Baker, ‘A Grammar of  Dissent’, 129– 50.   28  Valente, ‘Transgression’, 74.

Perhaps rather paradoxically, by positioning himself   as a scientist and speculative philosopher rather than an author, Hinton used the dimen- sional analogy as means of  experimentation and creation, instead of  treating it simply as  a tool of  description.3 1   This diff erence is one I will continue to highlight throughout this study: in writing a  work of  satire, Abbott self- consciously used the dimensional analogy as the foundation  for a fi ction that is ultimately designed to defl ect the reader’s attention back outward  to the social and cultural struggles of  the lived, three- dimensional world. In this sense,   Flatland relies on ‘science’ as a foundation for its fi ction, performing a function similar to  that of  much traditional science fi ction. As a scientifi c romancer, Hinton used analogy  to create the fi ction of  the fourth dimension; this is a space that is literally engendered  by the manipulation of  mathematical symbols. Hinton’s fourth dimension is the result of   accidental and partial movements of  terms across the discourses of  algebra, geometry  and physics.   We see a similar movement in the ‘new’ psychology of  the second half  of  the Victorian  period: Alexander Bain and Herbert Spencer based their explanations of  the functions  of  the nervous system on an analogy with physical theories of  force. These theories  were attacked on the grounds that they mistook analogy for fact, and ‘refused to accept  force as merely a mathematical function devised by physicists to aid understanding of   matter in motion’.3 2 As Rick Rylance notes, theories supported solely by analogy, such  as Bain’s, ‘have a cogency in principle, but are diffi  cult to sustain in detail’.3 3 It is in the  attempt to fl esh out the details of  the dimensional analogy that Hinton’s version of  the  fourth dimension is created. At work here is ‘the speculative, argumentatively- extended  character of  analogy’ in which, as Beer observes, ‘the arc of  desire seeks to transform the  conditional into the actual’.3 4 In the hands of  hyperspace philosophers such as Hinton,  the dimensional analogy became a transformational and revelatory device.   However, before we explore Hinton’s use of  this device, it is necessary to examine  the development of  the dimensional analogy over the forty years preceding his work. In  exploring the development of  the dimensional analogy from Gustav Fechner onward,  I highlight the hypostasization of  the terms of  analytic algebra into descriptive geometry,  which then led to what Hinton called ‘scientifi c romance’.3 5   Before Hinton: The Fourth Dimension 1846–1 880   In his 1846 essay, Fechner wrote:  ‘One imagines a small, colourful little man who  walks around in a camera obscura on the paper; here one has a being that exists in two   31  For just a few examples, see Beer, D arwin’s Plots , 73– 96; Bohm and Peat, S cience, Order and  Creativity ; Papin, ‘This Is Not a Universe’; and Arbib and Hesse, T he Construction of  Reality ,  147– 71.   32  Smith, ‘Physiological Psychology and the Philosophy of  Nature’, quoted in Rylance, 179.   33  Rylance, V ictorian Psychology , 180.   34  Beer, D arwin’s Plots , 79.   35  See also Throesch, ‘Nonsense in the Fourth Dimension’.  </page> <page sequence="11">    27  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 27 dimensions’. This two- dimensional being has no comprehension of  the extra dimension  of  space, depth, that extends upward and downward from his photosensitive paper. If   the philosophical possibility of  a third dimension of  space even occurred to this ‘little  man’, he would decide that its material existence was impossible. ‘Nevertheless’, Fechner  remarked, ‘there exists this third dimension’.3 6 Fechner continued, arguing that this little  man is in fact representative of  humanity with its three- dimensional prejudices: ‘We are  only little colourful men and little shadow men in three dimensions instead of  two’. 37 As  the two- dimensional being in the camera is oblivious to the three- dimensional world that  human beings inhabit, Fechner argued, so are humans oblivious to the fourth dimension  of space.   Strikingly, as Alexander L. Taylor observed in 1952, Fechner’s version of  the dimen- sional analogy anticipates animated fi lm: ‘At each moment we have a cross- section of  this  larger [four- dimensional] reality of  which we know nothing, any more than, shall we say,  Donald Duck, were he conscious, would know of  the world beyond his screen’.3 8 Taylor’s  language here exemplifi es how the dimensional analogy functions; replacing the two-  dimensional camera manikin with a Disney character, he directly implicates his audience  in the analogy, referring to the reader as ‘we’, the three- dimensional beings, are now part  of  the fi ction. Disturbingly, this analogy also implies the possibility that we, too, are being  watched by hyper- beings, something Hinton explicitly addressed in the fi rst series of  his   Scientifi c Romances .   Fechner was not the only one interested in imagining two- dimensional worlds dur- ing the decades before Hinton began writing; in fact, he may have borrowed this idea  from fellow German mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss.3 9 In Gauss’s biography, pub- lished shortly after his death, Sartorius von Waltershausen recalled that Gauss frequently  employed a similar analogy in lectures and conversations. Writing in an 1869 issue of    Nature , Sylvester noted that Gauss often remarked that ‘as we can conceive beings (like  infi nitely attenuated book- worms in an infi nitely thin sheet of  paper) which possess only  the notion of  space of  two dimensions, so we may imagine beings capable of  realis- ing space of  four or a greater number of  dimensions’.4 0 Henderson identifi es Sylvester’s  article as ‘a more direct impetus to the rise of  English speculation on the number of    36  Fechner, V ier Paradoxa , 24, my translation. I  do not off er a direct translation here; literally,  Fechner asks the reader to imagine ‘ein kleines buntes Männchen [a little, coloured man]’. In  deviating from the original text, I am trying to clarify Fechner’s intentions. He is asking the  reader to imagine a ‘real’, living, two- dimensional character whose total realm of  experience  consists of  the light- sensitive plate within the camera. I speculate he describes the manikin as  ‘coloured’ is in order to render it more lifelike, as opposed to the black- and- white negative  image of  the contemporary calotype.   37  Ibid., 25.   38  Taylor, T he White Knight , 90.   39  In a manner similar to the independent, concurrent formulations of  the theory of  evolution by  natural selection developed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, Gauss, along with  Johannes Bólyai and Nicholai Lobachevski, ‘discovered’ non- Euclidean geometry.   40  Sylvester, ‘A Plea’, 1: 238.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 28 28 BEFORE EINSTEIN  dimensions of  space’ than Fechner’s; indeed, the dimensional analogy began to appear  frequently in British scientifi c journals during the 1870s.4 1   The dimensional analogy became entangled in debates between empiricists and ide- alists concerning the psychology of  space perception. In 1870, Helmholtz fi rst employed  the dimensional analogy in an attempt to clarify the slippage in terminology that was  already occurring. Updating this discussion of  curved and n  - dimensional spaces six years  later, he reiterated:   To prevent misunderstanding I will once more observe that this so- called measure of  space-  curvature is a quantity obtained by purely analytical calculation and that its introduction  involves no suggestion of  relations that would have a meaning only for sense- perception.4 2   The language here carefully notes that Helmholtz was speaking only in analytical terms  and did not intend to attribute any kind of  descriptive value to this example. However,  in this same article he challenged Kant’s claim that the axioms of  Euclidean geometry  ‘are necessary consequences of  an a  priori transcendental form of  intuition’, arguing that  Kant was incorrect because we are able to represent other coherent and non- Euclidean  systems of  geometry for various curved spaces, as he had just demonstrated.4 3 In this,  Helmholtz was clearly attacking the idealists, because – as a result of  the new geom- etries – ‘it cannot be allowed that the axioms of  our geometry depend on the native form  of  our perceptive faculty, or are in any way connected with it’.4 4   For Hinton and other proponents of  the fourth dimension, the path lay somewhere  between Helmholtz’s empiricism and Kantian idealism. Rather than discard the Kantian  a priori wholesale, Hinton retained the framework: recognition of  the fourth dimension  was, for him, a means of  developing and expanding human consciousness. His hyper- space philosophy was founded on Kant’s claim that space is the means by which the mind  encounters the real; if  true, then conceiving and perceiving higher dimensions would  allow the mind to develop higher aesthetic and ethical sensibilities.   However, Hinton challenged Kant’s  claim   that complete space [...] has three dimensions, and that space in general cannot have more  is built on the proposition that [...] cannot be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on  intuition, and indeed, because it is apodictically certain, on pure intuition  a priori . 45   Not only did Hinton propose four dimensions, but in his second series of  S cientifi c Romances ,  he raised the possibility of  an unlimited number of  dimensions.4 6   The complex challenge to the Kantian a priori posited by proponents of  the new  geometries was aptly described by F. C. S. Schiller in 1896:   41  See also Blacklock, ‘Analogy and the Dimensional Menagerie’.   42  Helmholz, ‘The Origin and Meaning’, 308.

If  Euclidean geometry alone could prove the possibility  of  synthetic judgements a  priori , [...] surely now that it is reinforced by two or more sister  sciences, a boundless extension of  our a  priori knowledge might reasonably be anticipated.  Unfortunately it proves a case of  ‘too many cooks’ [...]. Just as the d e facto existence of  geom- etry seemed to Kant to prove the possibility of  an a  priori intuition of  Space, so the d e facto  existence of  metageometry [i.e., non- Euclidean geometries] indicates the derivative nature of   an intuition Kant had considered ultimate. 47   The introduction of  geometries based on non- Euclidean spaces causes the Kantian a  priori to deconstruct itself, revealing its derivative nature and status as artefact. Schiller  wondered whether the outcome of  this deconstruction was still too ‘inchoate and chaotic  for its full signifi cance to be determined’.4 8 One way of  resolving the chaos would be to  replace Kant’s three- dimensional apodictic certainty with a four- dimensional analogue.  A superfi cial reading of  Hinton, particularly his early writings, might allow one to con- clude that he is doing just this.   It would be easy to read Hinton’s fourth dimension as simply a tweaking of  Kantian  idealism, perhaps in response to the threat posed by the new geometries. However, in  exploring Hinton’s œuvre, we will fi nd something more complex at the heart of  his  hyperspace philosophy, a – to borrow Rick Rylance’s phrase – ‘gradual conceptual con- solidation of  multiple sources’.4 9 These sources included not only the new geometries and  Hinton’s immediate personal acquaintances, but current debates in physics, aesthetics  and ethics. These sources and discourses are consolidated and expressed within Hinton’s  hyperspace philosophy as a particular concern with the gap between external reality and  internal experience and the role of  the creative will in bridging this gap.   For Hinton the gap between external and internal was intimately intertwined with  the question of  the relationship between experience and intuition, of  – in William  James’s terminology – ‘percepts and concepts’.5 0 Like William James, Hinton worked on  the assumption that ‘percepts and concepts interpenetrate and melt together, impreg- nate and fertilize each other. Neither, taken alone, knows reality in its completeness’.5 1  Concepts, though they may become increasingly abstract, originate in perception, and  in order to be truthful (in James’s pragmatic sense), they must in turn impact perception  in a manner that modifi es both. Thus, Hinton treated his fourth dimension as a concept.  The problem, of  course, was the apparent lack of  evidence for the origin of  this concept  in perception. George Henry Lewes voiced the opinion of  many sceptics when he argued  that while non- Euclidean geometry (including the fourth dimension) ‘may be thoroughly  consistent, and ideally true’, the manipulation of  abstract mathematical symbols, though  done logically and consistently, does not support ‘the legitimacy of  extending any of  its  conclusions beyond that [abstract] sphere’.5 2   47  Schiller, ‘Non- Euclidean Geometry’, 178– 79.   48  Ibid., 174.   49  Rylance, V ictorian Psychology , 169.   50  W.

However, it would be impossible to imagine a fourth  dimension in addition to our own, because   as all our means of  sense- perception extend only to space of  three dimensions, and a fourth is  not merely a modifi cation of  what we have but something perfectly new, we fi nd ourselves by  reason of  our bodily organisation quite unable to represent a fourth dimension.5 4   Hinton did not disagree with the empiricism of  Helmholtz as expressed here; rather, he  sought to prove that humans can e xperience sensations of  higher dimensions. He was not  the only thinker to do so.   Physicist and spiritualist Johann Carl Friedrich Zöllner used Helmholtz’s work to  support his own claims for the existence of  four- dimensional space. 55 Zöllner, colleague  and friend of  Fechner, was also fascinated with the fourth dimension. Infl uenced by the  American medium Henry Slade, Zöllner was convinced that he had found experimental  proof  of  the existence of  the fourth dimension of  space. Slade, most famous for slate-  writing, also performed a series of  tricks, one of  which involved untying the knots of  a cord  with fused endings. Slade’s ability to untie the knots – seemingly without touching the cord  or disturbing the fused endings – convinced Zöllner that he was able to access the fourth  dimension of  space.5 6 Although an English court convicted Slade of  fraud in 1876, Zöllner  continued to support him and rely upon him for empirical evidence of  the existence of  the  fourth dimension: he published in the British Q uarterly Journal of  Science to this eff ect in 1878,  and his book on the subject, T ranscendental Physics , was translated into English in 1880.5 7   Although he, too, sought proof  of  a fourth spatial dimension, Hinton eschewed  involvement in Spiritualist and Theosophist debates. He also attempted to give his  dimensional analogy more solid scientifi c grounding as opposed to the anthropomorphic  narratives of  Fechner, Helmholtz, Abbott and others. While not entirely averse to the  fi ctive potential of  speculative analogy (as clearly indicated by the chosen title S cientifi c  Romances for much of  his work),  Hinton wanted to emphasize the scientifi c nature of  his  speculative analogies. In his fi rst scientifi c romance, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’  (1880), we see a variation on the anthropomorphic dimensional analogy:   53  Ibid., 193.   54  Helmholtz, ‘The Origin and Meaning’, 318– 19. Conversely, while making a similar distinction  between discussing two- dimensional and four- dimensional worlds, Lewes argued that it is only  possible to ‘symbolically construct a space of  two dimensions’. See ‘Imaginary Geometry’, 200.   55  See Stromberg, ‘Helmholtz and Zoellner’.   56  Staubermann, ‘Tying the Knot’.   57  See Zöllner, ‘On Space of  Four Dimensions’ and T ranscendental Physics .  </page> <page sequence="15">    31  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 31  If  there is a straight line before us two inches long, its length is expressed by the number  2. Suppose a square to be described on the line, the number of  square inches in this fi gure  is expressed by the number 4, i .e. , 2 × 2. This 2 × 2 is generally written 22  , and named ‘2  square.’   Now, of  course, the arithmetical process of  multiplication is in no sense identical with that  process by which a square is generated from the motion of  a straight line, or a cube from the  motion of  a square. But it has been observed that the units resulting in each case, though dif- ferent in kind, are the same in number.[...]   We have now a straight line two inches long. On this a square has been constructed containing  four square inches. If  on the same line a cube be constructed, the number of  cubic inches in  the fi gure so made is 8, i .e. , 2 × 2 × 2 or 23  . Here, corresponding to the numbers 2, 2 2 , 2 3 , we  have a series of  fi gures. Each fi gure contains more units than the last, and in each the unit  is of  a diff erent kind. [...] The straight line is said to be of  one dimension because it can be  measured only in one way. Its length can be taken, but it has no breadth or thickness. The  square is said to be of  two dimensions because it has both length and breadth. The cube is  said to have three dimensions, because it can be measured in three ways.   The question naturally occurs, looking at these numbers 2, 22  , 23  , by what fi gure shall we  represent 24  , or 2 × 2 × 2 × 2[?] We know that in the fi gure there must be sixteen units, or  twice as many units as in the cube. 58   Hinton’s decision to use algebraic symbols to represent lower- dimensional entities rather  than fl atland creatures is indicative of  an attempt to respond to recent scientifi c debates  about the possibility of  a spatial fourth dimension. As we will see, he constructed practi- cal mental and physical exercises he hoped would open the human consciousness to the  perception of  a fi gure that corresponds to 24  . He also proposed – though never rigor- ously developed – ways of  detecting the fourth dimension on the micro and macro levels  through examining the movements of  molecules and stellar bodies. Before he could jus- tify attempts to obtain experimental proof  of  the fourth dimension, however, he needed  to prove that it was possible to imagine it.   Helmholtz had argued that the problem with imagining the fourth dimension was  that it was ‘not merely a modifi cation of  what we have but something perfectly new [and]  we fi nd ourselves by reasons of  our bodily organisation quite unable to represent a fourth  dimension’. Hinton addressed this problem in the fi rst scientifi c romance, explaining  that, when trying to represent 24  ,   instead of  trying to fi nd something already known, to which the idea of  a fi gure correspond- ing to the fourth power can be affi  xed, let us simply reason out what the properties of  such  a fi gure must be. In this attempt we have to rely, not on a process of  touching or vision, such  as informs us of  the properties of  bodies in the space we know, but on a process of  thought.5 9   Hinton wanted to use the mind to imagine something entirely new – a possibility denied  even to Ruskin’s highest imaginative artist . To do this, it was necessary to engage with   58  Hinton, ‘What Is the Fourth Dimension?’, S cientifi c Romances , 9– 10.   59  Ibid., 10.  </page> <page sequence="16"> 32 32 BEFORE EINSTEIN  problems of  representation, and the relativity of  knowledge. This was the fi rst step in  Hinton’s lifelong project of  perceiving the ‘new’ space of  the fourth dimension.   Hinton’s Early Infl uences   Above, I have outlined the debates concerning the new geometries and the growing use  of  the dimensional analogy to demonstrate the possibility of  four- dimensional space in  the 1870s; this was the intellectual climate in which Hinton came of  age. It is important  to consider even more specifi cally the cultural milieu of  Oxford in the 1870s, and grow- ing debates concerning the role of  science and aesthetics in education. Two key fi gures  of  infl uence for Hinton during this time were his father, James Hinton, and John Ruskin.   Ruskin knew James Hinton personally, and both men were members of  the  Metaphysical Society in the early 1870s. James Hinton, who was well known in his own  time for his philosophical writings, died unexpectedly when his reputation was at its peak.  After his death late in 1875, a contributor to the journal M ind lamented:   His death at a critical period of  his life, when he had just attained his long- desired speculative  freedom, was a painful shock to his friends; nor could any country least of  all our own, well  aff ord to lose so earnest, unencumbered and well- equipped a pioneer in the search for the  truth.6 0   Similarly, Ruskin mourned the loss of  James Hinton in F ors Clavigera , writing of  a ‘dead  friend, [...] who could have taught us much’. 61 Like James Hinton’s writings in mysticism  and social philosophy, Hinton’s lifelong project of  perceiving the fourth dimension was a  ‘search for truth’. Hinton edited his father’s posthumous collection of  writings,  Chapters  on the Art of  Thinkin g, published in 1879, and there is some overlap between their phi- losophies. Two themes from James Hinton’s philosophical writings emerge as especially  important for the younger Hinton: ‘lawbreaking’ and ‘service’. While lawbreaking is per- haps most relevant in understanding Hinton’s fascination with the fourth dimension,  James Hinton’s concept of  service was most infl uential in the hyperspace philosophy that  his son developed as a result of  his interest in higher space. For now, I focus on lawbreak- ing, but I return to James Hinton’s concept of  service later in this chapter.   James Hinton argued that true genius lies in lawbreaking, or in removing artifi cial  limitations that are placed on human beings. In his last writings, he argued: ‘Man’s worst  evil is the false laws he puts on himself; and what he makes them regarding himself.  What Christ did for him was to show him how to escape’.6 2 Drawing on Romantic indi- vidualism and anticipating Nietzsche’s revaluation of  values, James Hinton’s lawbreaking  underpinned the free-l ove philosophy for which he became notorious.6 3 Very much a   60  Payne, ‘James Hinton’, 252.   61  Ruskin, W orks , 29: 67.   62  J.

Hinton’s challenge to Kant’s argument that the three- dimensional nature of  space  is a necessary absolute truth founded on unmediated human intuition shared similari- ties with – but was not identical to – Helmholtz and others’ attempts to undermine the  Kantian transcendental intuition. Taking a strictly empiricist approach, Helmholtz was  careful to note that there is no evidence to support a theory of  four- dimensional physi- cal space. However, by challenging Kant’s apodictic certainties about space perception,  empiricists like Helmholtz opened the door for the hyperspace philosophy of  Hinton.   At issue again is the migration of  ideas from context to context, and the unexpected  and unintended meanings which can arise from the fl uidity of  certain terms. The ques- tion, as Jonathan Smith has noted, was one of  ‘conceivability’, and what exactly was  meant by that term.6 4 Proponents of  classical geometry such as Whewell took the idealist  position that the axioms of  geometry were necessarily true because it was impossible to  conceive of  their contradiction.6 5 When Helmholtz challenged the idealist position by  arguing that it was possible to ‘represent to ourselves the look of  a pseudospherical world  in all directions just as we can develop the conception of  it’, he was aware of  the innate  diffi  culties of  the vocabulary. 66 ‘By the much abused expression “to represent” or “to be  able to think how something happens” ’, Helmholtz explained, ‘I understand [...] the  power of  imagining the whole series of  sensible impressions that would be had in such  a case’.6 7 In spite of  this attempt at clarifi cation, however, Helmholtz still confused these  terms: to think about ‘how something happens’ is diff erent from ‘imagining’ or represent- ing sensible impressions. Lilianne Papin observes that ‘in Western languages in particular,  the process of  thinking is linked to seeing’, and this is what makes modern physics so  diffi  cult to understand. 68 Hinton’s fourth dimension – as a transitional concept developed  in the gap between Newtonian and Einsteinian physics – encountered some of  the same  diffi  culties. Helmholtz struggled not only with the slippage between thinking and seeing,  but also the growing diff erences between how scientists and philosophers used language.   Idealist philosopher Jan Pieter Nicholas Land took Helmholtz to task for creeping  across ‘the fatal border’ between the discourses of  science and philosophy. Land’s overall  argument against empiricist challenges to the intuitive origins of  the axioms of  geometry  was somewhat tautological; he claimed that   to demand logical proof  for genuine geometrical axioms is a mistake, because every proof   must proceed from some ultimate premises, which in this case must concern space. There are  no data about space either in logic or arithmetic, but only in our sense- intuition, and precisely  the data expressed.6 9   64  J. Smith, F act and Feeling , 186.   65  Whewell, T he Philosophy of  the Inductive Sciences , 1: 665.   66  Helmholtz, ‘The Origin and Meaning’, 318.   67  Ibid., 304.   68  Papin, ‘This Is Not a Universe’, 1256.   69  Land, ‘Kant’s Space’, 39.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 34 34 BEFORE EINSTEIN   However, what interests me in Land’s response to Helmholtz is not his rebuttal of  the  challenge to Kant’s transcendental a priori, but rather his discussion of  the slippage  between the terms of  science and the terms of  philosophy:   We are told of  spherical and pseudospherical space, and non- Euclideans exert all their pow- ers to legitimate these as space by making them imaginable. We do not fi nd that they succeed  in this, unless the notion of  imaginability be stretched far beyond what Kantians and others  understand by the word. To be sure, it is easy to imagine a spherical surface as a construction  in Euclid’s space; but we vainly attempt to get an intuition of  a solid standing in the same rela- tion to that surface as our own solids stand to the plane. [...] We may cloak our perplexity by  special phrases, saying that only limited strips of  the surface can be ‘connectedly represented  in our space,’ while it may yet be ‘thought of  as infi nitely continued in all directions’. The  former is just what is commonly understood by being ‘imagined,’ whereas being ‘thought of ’  does not imply imagination any more than in the case of, say, √- 1. 70   The distinction between being ‘thought of ’ on one side and being imagined or repre- sented on the other, is one that Land extended to further his idealist stance. We must  learn to distinguish between notions of  ‘reality’ and ‘objectivity’, Land argued: while  these concepts are identical for the scientist (or natural philosopher), they are not so to the  idealist philosopher. ‘Reality’ is the term used to denote that which exists outside of  the  mind of  the perceiver, while the ‘object’ is the impression that is received by the mind of   the reality outside of  it. The question that a philosopher must address, Land claimed, is  how much the object diff ers from the real. ‘If ’, he continued, ‘it were established beyond  all doubt that the “object” and the “real” are one and the same, all examination of  such  questions and theories would become empty ceremony, and the paradoxes of  Idealism  absurdities unworthy of  our notice’.7 1   Land, like Kant, was not a pure idealist in that he acknowledged that there is s ome- thing outside of  mind. The philosopher’s interest, he argued, lies in the gap between the  perceived object and the real. The scientist, in order to be able to formulate and test  hypotheses, must assume that these are one and the same. The empirical method is not  applicable to Kant’s discussion of  space intuition because, Land argued, our experience  of  space is necessarily fi ltered through our space intuition, which is a priori. What is  interesting here is how Land left open the possibility for the actual existence of  a fourth  spatial dimension. Since scientists and mathematicians are able to theorize about the  properties of  four- dimensional space, Land continued,   there is no reason to deny the same faculty to our imaginary surface- men. [...] Some genius  among them might conceive the bold hypothesis of  a third dimension, and demonstrate that  actual observations are perfectly explained by it. Henceforth there would be a double set of   geometrical axioms; one the same as ours, belonging to science, and another resulting from  experience in a spherical surface only, belonging to daily life. The latter would express the  ‘object’ of  sense- intuition; the former, ‘reality,’ incapable of  being represented in empirical   70  Ibid., 41.   71  Ibid., 40.  </page> <page sequence="19">    35  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 35 space, but perfectly capable of  being thought of  and admitted by the learned as real, albeit  diff erent from the space inhabited.7 2   Thus, Land employed his own dimensional analogy, with the implication that four-  dimensional space might exist, albeit as form of  the real that is not accessible to human  intuition. It is therefore unimaginable and unrepresentable, even it if  is possible to think  and talk about its existence. Here again, is the distinction between Vernunft and Verstand,  which Sylvester feared was being blurred by English philosophers.   Such debates about the nature of  space were part of  a larger cultural divide between  idealist and empiricist philosophers; similarly, debates concerning Euclidean and the new  geometries were invested with underlying class allegiances. The theory of  the fourth  dimension became a focal point for these debates during the 1870s. These underlying  issues shaped Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, which was undoubtedly informed by his  own experiences as an Oxford undergraduate. Hinton began his career at Oxford as an  unaffi  liated student in 1871, and later joined Balliol College in 1873. Balliol at this time  was known for its modern liberalism, as well as its philosophical idealism. Thomas Hill  Green, who later became the fi rst professor of  philosophy at the University, was a tutor  at Balliol while Hinton was a student. Green’s lectures on Kant likely infl uenced Hinton,  as there are clear echoes of  Green’s ideas in Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy. During the  time that the dimensional analogy was appearing with increasing frequency in British  periodicals, Green was lecturing his students on Kant’s C ritique of  Pure Reason . In Green’s  interpretation of Kant:   The primariness or a  priori character of  the ideas which constitute space and time [...] means  that it is the condition, without which no feelings would become outward things, so that all  other conditions of  ‘phænomena’ may be supposed absent, but not that. [...] In this lies the  explanation of  Kant’s distinction between the idea of  space as an i ntuition and other ideas as   conceptions .7 3   What is implied here – at least in Hinton’s later interpretation of  Kant via Green – is  that the intuition of  space is the condition of  all perception. To somehow expand this  intuition would therefore be to expand the perceptual capabilities of  the mind, and this  idea became the foundation of  Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, which is itself  a project  of  consciousness expansion founded on a strange blend of  constructivism and positivism.   Green was not Hinton’s only infl uence at Oxford. While at Balliol, he was acquainted  with Arnold Toynbee, who later became an infl uential fi gure for social reformers in the  1880s and 1890s.7 4 Hinton was also a member of  Ruskin’s inner circle of  undergradu- ate followers, working as a captain on the Hinksey road project.7 5 In a diary entry for 10  December 1874, Ruskin recorded looking at Turner paintings with Hinton, breakfasting   72  Ibid., 40.   73  Green, W orks , 2: 10– 11, original emphasis.   74  See Toynbee, ed.

Hinton likely attended some of  Ruskin’s lectures in the early 1870s, and would have cer- tainly been familiar with his earlier work. At this stage in his life, Ruskin was concerned in  part with social works, as evinced by his sponsorship of  the Hinksey project and his series  of  pamphlets,  Fors Clavigera , begun in 1871. In addition to his early interest in drawing,  Hinton had expressed an interest in ‘studying geometry as a direct act of  perception’ as  early as 1869, and he would have been particularly interested in Ruskin’s lectures on the  relationship between the arts and sciences in early 1872, in which he claimed ‘the sci- ences of  light and form (optics and geometry)’ to be in ‘true fellowship with art’.7 7   Hinton’s later desire to instruct others towards a new way of  seeing – as expressed  through his hyperspace philosophy – is not dissimilar from Ruskin’s work as a critic and  teacher. Elizabeth K. Helsinger has noted how ‘reading Ruskin can become learning  to see with Ruskin’, and more recently Francis O’Gorman observed that  Fors Clavigera  ‘requires its readers to perceive, to discern truths in a manner of  the great artists’, as  Ruskin originally outlined in the third volume of  M odern Painters . 78 In his informal tutori- als with Ruskin, as well as in more formal lectures and by reading, Hinton would have  been introduced to Ruskin’s idea of  the great artist who is able simultaneously to perceive  and keep separate objective and subjective accounts of  the outside world.   Although he was to infl uence a number of  second- generation British idealists and  Balliol men, Ruskin mocked the English proponents of  German idealism in his famous  discussion of  the pathetic fallacy: ‘German dullness, and English aff ectation’, he wrote,  have caused the ‘objectionable’ terms, o bjectivity and s ubjectivity , to be too much in vogue.  Ruskin off ered his own interpretation of  British idealists’ use of  these terms:   The qualities of  things which thus depend upon our perception of  them, and upon human  nature as aff ected by them, shall be called Subjective; and the qualities of  things which they  always have, irrespective of  any other nature, as roundness or squareness, shall be called  Objective. 79  R uskin proposed simplifying these terms to the ‘plain old English’ phrases of  ‘It seems  so to me’ and ‘It  is so’, 80 which elides the empirical gap that fascinated the British ideal- ists: he aligns the objective, or ‘It i s so’, with ‘the ordinary, proper, and true appearances  of  things to us’, and the subjective to the pathetic fallacy.8 1 The confl ation of  the objec- tive and subjective is obvious here; in simplifying the terms, the appearance of  things   76  The Diaries of  John Ruskin: 1874– 1889 , 830. Ruskin refers simply to ‘Hinton’ in the diary entry,  and Evans and Whitehouse speculate that this is James Hinton. However, given the date and  his relationship with Ruskin at the time, I believe this refers to Charles Howard Hinton.   77  See J. Hinton, L ife and Letters , 251– 52.

The objective and subjective are just the fi rst two classes in Ruskin’s hierarchy of   perception: the third encompasses both photographic/ objective realism and subjective  pathos, while managing to distinguish between the two. Ruskin identifi ed this third class  as belonging to the ‘fi rst order of  poets’. Above all three of  these modes of  perception,  however, is a fourth, a sort of  passive hyper- perception where   men who, strong as human creatures can be, are yet submitted to infl uences stronger than  they, and see in a sort untruly, because what they see is inconceivably above them. This last is  the usual condition of  prophetic inspiration. 82   It is this fourth way of  seeing that Hinton wanted to activate in his readers by training  them to ‘see’ hyperspace. However, in order to not be overcome by such a vision, these  hyper- perceivers would need to transcend Ruskin’s highest order of  poet. This involved a  sort of  evolution of  aesthetic sensibility whereby the perceiver would be able to maintain  the clear vision of  the fi rst order of  poets when presented with something that ‘is incon- ceivably above them’. To instigate this evolution, the inconceivable must become con- ceivable and the intuition must be prepared through the education of  the imagination.   The Ruskinian Imagination   It is instructive here to turn to Ruskin’s early writings on the imagination. In the second  volume of  M odern Painters , he wrote that the greatest works of  art are not those that  mimetically transcribe the real world, but those that ‘invariably receive the refl ection  of  the mind’ of  the artist and ‘are modifi ed or coloured by its image’. ‘This modifi ca- tion’, Ruskin explained, ‘is the Work of  Imagination’. 83 Ruskin devoted an entire sec- tion of  this volume to defi ning and describing the imagination, which he distinguished  from conception. Ruskin’s defi nition of  conception is important for our understanding of   debates between geometers and philosophers regarding the conceivability of  the fourth  dimension.   Ruskin distinguished between two ways of  knowing a material object: one is verbal,  whereby certain facts are stored in the brain ‘as known, but not conceived’, which ‘we  may recollect without any conception of  the object at all’. The other is visual, whereby  facts about the object exist in the brain as images, ‘which [...] would be diffi  cult to  express verbally’, or to represent.8 4 According to Ruskin, the latter way of  knowing an  object is conception, but it is still n ot imagination. To say that something is conceivable  therefore means one is able to visualize an object but cannot represent it to another  person. Only the artist, who possesses the imaginative faculties, is able to conceive of    82  Ibid., 209.   83  Ruskin, W orks , 4: 223.   84  Ibid., 229.  </page> <page sequence="22"> 38 38 BEFORE EINSTEIN  something a nd represent it accurately, to put it out into the world as something to be  perceived by another.   The artist in possession of  the associative imaginative faculty is able to create a  harmonized whole:   If  [...] the combination made is to be harmonious, the artist must induce in each of  its  component parts (suppose two only, for simplicity’s sake), such imperfection as that the  other shall put it right. If  one of  them be perfect by itself, the other will be an excrescence.  Both must be faulty when separate, and each corrected by the presence of  the other. [...]  The two imperfections must be correlatively and simultaneously conceived. This is imagi- nation [...] two ideas which are separately wrong, which together shall be right, and of   whose unity, therefore, the idea must be formed at the instant they are seized, as it is only in  that unity that either are good, and therefore on the conception of  that unity can prompt  the preference.8 5   Hinton echoed Ruskin in his second series of  S cientifi c Romances when he wrote that ‘imag- ination, acting on perception of  the outer world, enables the artist to see exactly how his  picture would look if  a strip of  colour or a new form were introduced’. 86 To perceive such  a unity and translate it into a work of  art is to be ‘an inventor’, to enact a ‘prophetic action  of  mind’.8 7 Like the scientist, the imaginative artist hypothesizes a potential synthesis of   incomplete fragments and proceeds to test that hypothesis. The unseen possibility of  this  synthesis is the same proposed by non- Euclideans and hyperspace philosophers, whom  Land derides as claiming reality for something of  which ‘only limited strips of  the surface  can be “connectedly represented in our space” ’.8 8 An imaginative, ‘great’ artist is needed  to translate the thought into reality, to unify the limited conceivable strips into a perceiv- able harmonious whole. It is the imagination that allows the artist to reveal the invisible  harmony from existing visible fragments. This movement from seen to unseen shares the  creative potential of  the analogy.   There is a second faculty of  the imagination according to Ruskin, which is just as  important as the associative:  this is a ‘penetrating, possession- taking faculty’, which  clearly presupposes a subjective ego. This faculty allows the imagination to see ‘the heart  and inner nature’ of  things.8 9 Here we see the desire to obliterate the subjective ego while  simultaneously protecting it. The imaginative subject is needed to penetrate the superfi - cial appearances of  the material world, while at the same time it must not be led astray  by its subjectivity. Jay Fellows observes this paradox in Ruskin when he notes that ‘to  lose sight of  oneself  is to become an invisible man. And only the invisible man is worthy  of  self- portraiture’, according to Ruskin.9 0 Lindsay Smith, who examines Ruskin’s early   85  Ibid., 233– 34.   86  Hinton, ‘On the Education of  the Imagination’, S cientifi c Romances , 5.   87  Ruskin, W orks , 4: 233– 34.   88  Land, ‘Kant’s Space’, 41.   89  Ibid., 251 and 253.   90  Fellows, T he Failing Distance , 71.

The result is an inevitably  strange hybrid: a desire for an invisible man, a poetic identity who is newly aware visually, but  whose intelligence absents itself  and whose educated eye avoids self- assertion.9 1   Hinton’s fourth dimension similarly functioned as a paradoxical space of  self-  transcendence and self- possession, as we will see in the next two chapters. While his  hyperspace philosophy was no doubt informed directly by Ruskin, both men were par- ticipants in what George Levine has identifi ed as ‘the epistemological ventures of  moder- nity [which] are thick with paradox – materiality entails the incorporeal, the self  gains its  power by annihilating itself ’.9 2   Such paradoxes preclude simple contrasts between Ruskin, the anti- sensualist on the  one hand, and Walter Pater and the Aesthetes on the other. As Nicholas Shrimpton and  others have demonstrated, there is no clear- cut opposition possible here. Although in the  1880s Ruskin took care to diff erentiate between the what he saw as the crass sensualist  perception of  beauty championed by the Aesthetes (‘aesthesis’) and his own moral per- ception of  beauty (‘theoria’), Shrimpton rightly notes that the diff erence here was one of   degree, not kind.9 3 Anticipating the quarrel between H. G. Wells and Henry James over  the art of  fi ction, ‘Ruskin’s argument with the Aesthetes had the bitterness and intensity  often associated with internecine quarrels, and an internecine quarrel is precisely what it  was’. 94 Kenneth Daley’s work is useful here in his examination of  Pater’s refi guration of   Ruskin’s pathetic fallacy, which he claims ‘converts what Ruskin judges to be intemperate  passion into a heightened sense of  sympathy and pity, thereby rescuing what Ruskin con- demns in romantic practice’.9 5 As I demonstrate in the  next chapter , rather than attempt  to avoid the pathetic fallacy, in his early  Scientifi c Romances , Hinton also attempted to push   through it toward a heightened, four- dimensional consciousness.   Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy can be read in part as a response to Ruskin’s infl u- ence over Victorian aesthetic debates; his push to develop a higher, four- dimensional  consciousness was an attempt to address Ruskin’s ideal of  the creative power of  the  associative imagination, which ‘seizes and combines at the same instant, not only two,  but all the important ideas of  a poem or picture, and while it works with any one of   them, it is at the same instant working with modifying all in their relations to it, never  losing sight of  their bearings on each other’.9 6 This creative agent, which seems to be  made ‘after the image of  God’, is decidedly male, but it must encompass the ‘powers’  that Ruskin elsewhere attributes to the female:  ordering, arrangement, sympathy and   91  L.

Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, like Pater’s  reclamation of  the Italian Renaissance, can be read as an attempt to engage with (and  re- envision) Ruskin’s ideal creative agent.   Hinton’s Hyperspace Philosophy   In his hyperspace philosophy, Hinton strove to do something more than simply popular- ize the theory of  the fourth dimension. He proclaimed his interest in geometry at a time  when discussions of  the new geometries were reaching the British press, and it is clear  that from the beginning he was drawn to explore the aesthetic implications of  the new  trend in geometry. In 1869, James Hinton wrote to his son:   I am glad you like the idea of  studying geometry as an exercise of  direct perception. I think it  must be specially valuable so; and I am very pleased that you think it practicable and useful.  The habit of  looking thoroughly and minutely into things, alike with the eyes and with the  reason, so as to cultivate the power of  s eeing their qualities and relations, and not merely trying  to infer them, must be a most excellent one. It will be most valuable to you.9 8   Apparently, in recent correspondence Hinton had indicated his interest in geometry. In  celebrating the importance of  looking ‘alike with the eyes and with the reason’, James  Hinton proposed a relationship between percepts and concepts similar to that of  William  James and, before him, Ruskin. In fact, Hinton’s later sympathy with William James may  be in part due to the fact that James’s philosophy was ‘somewhat eccentric in its attempt  to combine logical realism with an otherwise empiricist mode of  thought’.9 9 ‘Logical  realism’ here means ‘the platonic [s ic ] doctrine [...] that physical realities are constituted  by the various concept- stuff s of  which they “partake” ’.1 00 Hinton’s willingness to pursue  ‘eccentric’ combinations of  philosophical schools echoes the work of  his father as well as  Ruskin, and would have appealed to William James.   In the same letter, James Hinton urged his son to consider ‘the knowledge of  phe- nomena, that is, of  what the senses can perceive, [as] the best basis you can lay’ for future  studies. 101 Aside from his original transubstantiation of  the spatial fourth dimension via  analogy, Hinton followed this advice throughout his career. His hyperspace philosophy   9 7 S ee, for example, Ruskin’s lecture ‘On Queens’ Gardens’, in W orks , 18: 122. Certainly, the  diff erence in aesthetic views of  Ruskin and Pater can be read as in some measure informed by  sexual orientation and identity.

James, W ritings, 1902– 1910 , 1037.   100  Ibid., 1036– 37.   101  Hopkins, ed., L ife and Letters , 251.  </page> <page sequence="25">    41  IMAGINING ‘SOMETHING PERFECTLY NEW’ 41 was also an eccentric combination that Mark McGurl has aptly described as ‘transcen- dental materialism’:   The particular appeal of  the fourth dimension was as a potential means of  reintegrating the  two sides of  [...] the ‘Omnipresent Debate’ in the nineteenth century between empiricism  and transcendentalism, or, more roughly, between the competing cultural authority of  science  and religion. [...] More broadly, non- Euclidean geometry suggested in its own way the pos- sibility of  a ‘transcendental materialism’ similar in some respects to that being developed by  fi gures such as Walter Pater, whose aestheticism merged the traditions of  British empiricism  and German idealism.1 02   Indeed, Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy should be read as an attempt to provide a new  basis for considering matter and spirit; at its foundation it is a celebration of  mediation,  of  the technology of  representation. For him, ‘space conditions’ are the fundamental  mediator, as he explained in the opening pages of  his fi rst book- length philosophical  treatment of  the fourth dimension:   It is generally said that the mind cannot perceive things in themselves, but can only appre- hend them subject to space conditions. And in this way the space conditions are as it were  considered somewhat in the light of  hindrances, whereby we are prevented from seeing what  the objects in themselves truly are. [...] There is in so many books in which the subject is  treated an air of  despondency – as if  this space apprehension were a kind of  veil which shut  us off  from nature. But there is no need to adopt this feeling. The fi rst postulate of  this book is  the full recognition of  the fact, that it is by means of  space that we apprehend what is. Space  is the instrument of  the mind. 103   While Hinton accepted the assumption that space apprehension is ‘a kind of  veil’ between  the perceiving mind and reality, he disagreed with the idealist philosopher’s interpreta- tion of  this ‘fact’. It is not a limitation to despair of, he argued. Identifying space as ‘the  instrument of  the mind’ opens up new possibilities for the mind; accepting space ‘as the  instrument of  the mind’ allows the possibility that – by tuning the instrument – humans  can embark on ‘a new era of  thought’.   Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy is aptly described as a kind of  materialism because  he emphasized the textual nature of  his project: for him, there was nothing outside of   space perception. Nevertheless, hyperspace philosophy can also be described as transcen- dental because it proclaims a ‘higher’ form of  mediation out there to be discovered and  developed. His was not an absolutist project: as we will see, Hinton was open to the pos- sibility that there were ‘many dimensions’ beyond four. What was important for Hinton  and many modernists who were interested in the fourth dimension was the p rocess of  real- izing the fourth dimension. As Bell and Lland have observed, for Hinton and twentieth-  century hyperspace philosophers such as Claude Bragdon, ‘the Fourth Dimension means   102  McGurl, T he Novel Art , 62.   103  Hinton, A  New Era , 2.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 42 42 BEFORE EINSTEIN  not so much an attainable place, but a matter of  developed consciousness, a process of   exploration’.1 04   Hinton believed that undergoing this process of  development would result in an aesthetic  and social revolution. Here James Hinton’s thoughts on ‘service’ are particularly important.  As a young man, Hinton was encouraged to consider the broader implications of  his work  and to treat the coming era as portentous. In 1870, James Hinton wrote to his son to con- gratulate him on his decision to refuse confi rmation into the Church of  England, which he  regarded as a positive step toward making ‘all your life transparent’ and ‘banish[ing] all the  false pretences which fi ll our present life with evil’. James Hinton saw the organized Church  as hypocritical and many of  its members cynically political. Although in one sense Hinton  was being groomed for worldly success (he was at the time a student at Rugby and soon to  be an Oxford undergraduate), his real mission, according to his father, was to enable himself   ‘to take up what we [James Hinton’s generation] leave unfi nished, and perfect what we do  incompletely’: to, in a sense, become Ruskin’s paradoxical invisible man. This task was of  the  utmost importance because, according to James Hinton,   it is a great age of  the world for which you are preparing – an age in which the great question  of  true signifi cance of  human life will, at least, begin to decide itself. [...] This is one question  men will have to answer, Is it our nature to take the best care of  ourselves or to live in giving  up? I know how your heart would answer this, and I think the time is coming when all men  will give the same. 105   James Hinton’s concept of  altruistic ‘service’, like Ruskin’s invisible man, was full of   contradictions that Hinton attempted to reconcile within his hyperspace philosophy.   Concerned with the relationship between the material and spiritual, particularly with  reference to morality, James Hinton argued that morality needed to be approached in  a more ‘scientifi c’ manner; while the sciences had embraced inductive reasoning, moral  philosophers and theologians were still struggling ‘to fi nd a “right” for [...] feelings and  [...] actions without having laid the basis of  a true response to facts’.1 06 Contemporary  morality was currently centred on the self, James Hinton argued, citing the frequent  opposition of  desire for pleasure against the ‘goodness’ of  duty as support for his case.  He wrote:   The thought of  goodness in diminished pleasure betrays its origin: it arose from putting self   fi rst; which perverts the thought of  goodness into that of  self- restraint: – into goodness a bout  self  and for its sake. 107   According to James Hinton, the basis for morality should be altruism, and by this  word he meant ‘Myself  in and for others’.1 08 Here he proposed a kind of  self- fulfi lment   104  Bell and Lland, ‘Silence and Solidity’, 2: 124.   105  Hopkins, ed., L ife and Letters , 254.   106  J.

There was no need to waste intel- lectual and moral ‘strength in eff orts to rise above sense’.1 09 Rather, James Hinton argued  that the perfect moral condition would consist of  an alignment of  desire with serving  others. What drew Havelock Ellis and other progressives to James Hinton’s writings was  the implication that if  personal pleasure was sometimes the outcome of  fulfi lling others’  needs, then pleasure was to be embraced as well.   Hinton saw the study of  space as a means of  obtaining James Hinton’s perfected state  of  altruistic desire. For the four- dimensional consciousness, the diff erence between duty  and desire dissolves. In the dimensional analogy, we who live in three dimensions are able  to see the inner workings of  two- dimensional creatures; we can observe underlying uni- ties to which they remain blind. Similarly, Hinton explained that, ‘to our ordinary [three-  dimensional] space-t hought, men are isolated, distinct, in great measure antagonistic’.  However, after undergoing the process of  realizing a four- dimensional perspective, ‘it is  easily seen that all men may really be members of  one body, their isolation may be but  an aff air of  limited consciousness’.1 10 The higher viewpoint is expressed in numerous  ways, from the penetrating light of  X- rays, to the mystical ‘mother- sea of  consciousness’  of  Fechner and William James. 111 It is not surprising that many fi n- de- siècle progressives  were drawn to Hinton’s fourth dimension. Boundaries of  class and gender were dissolved  under the levelling gaze from the fourth dimension.   The surrender of  the self ’s desires to others’ needs is paradoxically self- centred: there  is no longer an absolute standard of  ‘right’ and ‘wrong’; rather, moral judgement must  be made on a case- by- case basis, to be determined by the internal condition of  the  individual in question. Taking issue with moral philosopher and acquaintance Henry  Sidgwick, James Hinton made the case for moral relativism. In his 1874 M ethods of  Ethics ,  Sidgwick had argued for the ‘fundamental assumption’ of  an absolute standard of  right  and wrong. However, James Hinton wrote that   refl ection shows us not only that right and wrong are qualities incapable of  pertaining to  things, inasmuch as the same external deed will be, by universal consent, right or wrong, not  only under diff erent circumstances, but according to the feelings prompting it. Thus a father  rightly chastises a son for a fault for the son’s good; but the same blow given in selfi sh anger  would be a crime. [...]   That which is wrong if  done for oneself  may become right when the claims of  ‘good’ demand  it. And the reason of  the paramount importance of  this response or non- response of  the emo- tions to facts is obvious; it is a question of  truth or falsity, of  accord or discord between our  consciousness and the world. 112   Hinton was well aware of  the revolutionary implications of  his father’s reliance on  service as a basis for morality. In her testimony at his bigamy trial, Hinton’s second wife,   109  J. Hinton, ‘On the Basis’, 785.   110  Hinton, A  New Era , 97.   111  See W. James, W ritings, 1878– 1899 , 1100– 27.   112  J. Hinton, ‘On the Basis’, 782.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 44 44 BEFORE EINSTEIN  Maude Florence, explained that ‘he did not marry [her] to hurt anyone else, but simply  in order that she might have a certifi cate for her children’.1 13 Of  course, these children  were (presumably) Hinton’s children as well, conceived after his marriage to his fi rst wife,  so Hinton’s moral justifi cation rings somewhat hollow.   However, the fact that Hinton viewed his bigamous marriage in the light of  his father’s  philosophy of  service is supported by his oblique reference to the incident in A  New Era of   Thought , a text which was published in 1888 with a cryptic preface by the editors noting  that Hinton had left the manuscript in an unfi nished state ‘on his leaving England for  a distant foreign appointment’.1 14 This was in reference to Hinton’s fl ight from Britain  after his bigamy conviction. Later, within this book, Hinton highlighted the ‘dangerous’  nature of  his claim that it is necessary to ‘cast out the self ’ in order to access hyperspace.   The problem as it comes to me, is this: it is clearly demonstrated that self- regard is to be put  on one side – and self- regard in every respect – not only should things painful and arduous be  done, but things degrading and vile, so that they serve.   I am to sign any list of  any number of  deeds which the most foul imagination can suggest, as  things which I would do did the occasion come when I could benefi t another by doing them;  and, in fact, there is to be no characteristic in any action which I would shrink from did the  occasion come when it presented itself  to be done for another’s sake. And I believe that the  soul is absolutely unstained by the action, provided the regard is for another.1 15   Given the stilted language here, the grammatical awkwardness and obscure referent,  it is only comprehensible as an allusion to Hinton’s bigamy conviction. In the following  chapters we will see how the moral relativity of  ‘service’ played itself  out in Hinton’s  hyperspace philosophy. For the present, it is important to observe Hinton’s vision of   hyperspace philosophy as a moral endeavour.   Writing of  Hinton’s hyperspace philosophy, Bruce Clarke identifi es it as ‘a specifi c  and signifi cant response to the evolutionistic vogue for superhuman types’ at the turn  of  the century.1 16 Certainly, in Part Two of  this book, I read Hinton’s work as part of   such a response, alongside Wells, Nietzsche and the James brothers, all of  whom were  concerned with accessing, developing and liberating a higher aesthetic will. However, it  is important to acknowledge the roots of  Hinton’s project as well: his striving to develop  the hyperconscious self  is also an attempt to transcend Ruskin’s artist of  the highest order  and to engender the ‘lawbreaker’, of  whom James Hinton wrote. Recuperating Hinton’s  hyperspace philosophy allows us to better understand its context; his work stands as yet  another link between the periods and movements traditionally associated with either the  nineteenth or the twentieth centuries, Victorians or moderns.    113  ‘Extraordinary Confession of  Bigamy’, n.p.   114  A.
