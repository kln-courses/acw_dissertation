<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COMPARISON OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND ACHIEVEMENT OF ARISTOTLE AND BACON. I. IN opposition to the realism of Plato, Aristotle did not regard universals as transcendent of the world of sense, but as im- manent in numerically distinct sense-particulars. Knowledge of universals is obtained by vows and arises out of the preliminary observation of sense-particulars. For example, knowledge of the universal or type, 'man,' is obtained by vows and arises out of the preliminary observation of individual men. Again, apprehension by vois of the axioms (universals) of astronomy follows percep- tion of astronomical phenomena. To such intellectual process, distinctly termed induction ( raywyi' ), and involving an ad- vance from some particulars to a universal, Aristotle ascribes certainty. Noi3s is the guarantee of truth.' There is a different treatment of induction in An. Prior., II, 23, viz., the Inductive Syllogism. This induction also is termed eiraymyr. It is known that: Man, horse, mule are long-lived. Man, horse, mule are bileless animals. Assuming that man, horse, mule exhaust the class of bileless ani- mals, we can formulate this syllogism: Man, horse, mule are long-lived. All bileless animals are man, horse, mule. All bileless animals are long-lived. With reference to this, Aristotle's own example of the Induc- tive Syllogism, we assume that, to convert the original minor premise to "All bileless animals are man, horse, mule," Aristotle did not consider it necessary to examine every individual man in the species man, every individual horse in the species horse, etc. Such an exhaustion of instances is impossible, for at any one time they must, in regard to actual observation, be considered to be infinite. Obviously impossible, also, is the observation now of 1 See An. Post. I, 1-3, 18, 31; I, 19. 471</page><page sequence="2">472 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXI. the particular instances of the future. If the exhaustion of par- ticular instances were necessary to establish the truth of a uni- versal proposition, no universal proposition could ever be estab- lished. And this, we can hardly think, was Aristotle's view. Is not his doctrine of the Inductive Syllogism an attempt to show how to establish a universal proposition with absolute certainty? Whewell adds this consideration: " Aristotle says, 'We must con- ceive that C consists of a collection of all the particular cases; for induction is applied to all the cases.' We must conceive ( Vo0lV ) that C in the major, consists of all the cases, in order that the conclusion may be true of all the cases; but we cannot observe all the cases." 1 A third consideration is metaphysical. Accord- ing to Aristotle, to know a concrete individual is to know it as embodying a universal. We perceive Kallias in virtue of the fact that he is a concrete individual embodying the universal 'man.' If, then, Kallias is bileless, so will all other individual men be on the assumption either that there is a real connection between bile- lessness and what we are pleased to regard as the connotation of man or that bilelessness is itself part of that connotation. If Kallias is lame, so will all other individual men be-this does not follow either because there is no real connection between lame- ness and the connotation of man or because lameness is not part of that connotation. Aristotle, however, has not shown us when we are entitled to assume that what is true of Kallias is true of all other individual men. He has not shown us under what con- ditions we are entitled to assume " that the nature of each species of beast might be judged from the single specimen dissected." 2 Aristotle, then, did not teach the necessity of exhaustion of particular instances in connection with his Inductive Syllogism. He taught the necessity of the exhaustion of types or species. And, with the qualifications just noted, the examination of one individual of a species was sufficient. To Aristotle science consisted in the discovery of the causes of things. For this reason we may assume that the Inductive Syllogism was an attempt to discover causal connections.

In De Part. An., IV, 2, definite reference is made to bilelessness as the cause of longevity. Now, according to Aristotle's principles, we should not expect enumeration of instances, even when exhaustive, to give absolute certainty. We have not yet transcended the con- tingency of matter. Novs alone can give absolute certainty, and probably Aristotle held that the action of vois was the final and necessary step to comprehend a universal of causation. In An. Post., I, 5, Aristotle teaches that enumeration of instances, even when complete, does not give absolute certainty. We come now to a third kind of induction taught by Aristotle. The word bcraywy) is still employed. It is the induction of dialectic and is set forth in the Topics.1 This induction recog- nises the truth for practical purposes of a universal proposition if many instances support it, and if no negative instance has been found to contradict it. If the respondent in a debate questions the truth of the universal proposition, it rests with him to bring forward a contradictory instance in support of his contention. If he fail to do so, the proposition remains intact. In conformity with his theories of iraywlyrq, Aristotle emphasises the importance of paying attention to the facts of experience. "Let us first understand the facts, and then we may seek for their causes." 2 "What could sound more Baconian than the saying with which Aristotle closes his discussion of the proc- ess of generation among bees: 'The facts on this subject have not yet been sufficiently ascertained; if ever they are, it will be necessary to trust our senses more than our reasonings, and the latter only when the results are in agreement with the phe- nomena. "'3 In Aristotle's De Generatione Animalium there is "more frequent and emphatic protest against inadequate observa- tions, against illicit generalizations and 'empty' generalities, against too far-fetched explanations, against the preference of reasoning to fact, against the arbitrary substitution of plausible conjecture for the actualities of perception."' Aristotle lays I See particularly I, i8; VIII, 2; VIII, g$ 2De Part.

XXXI. emphasis on the importance of observing facts of nature, high and low, pleasing and unpleasing.' Only by studying the facts of nature can the principles of particular sciences be attained.2 If any sensation is wanting, so much knowledge is wanting.3 Aristotle's recognition of the importance of paying attention to the facts of experience is reflected in his support of Atomism. After describing the opinions of some earlier philosophers, Aris- totle says: "Thus, proceeding in violation of sensation, and dis- regarding it, because, as they held, they must follow reason, some came to the conclusion that the universe was one, and infinite, and at rest. As it appeared, however, that though this ought to be by reasoning, it would go near to madness to hold such opinions in practice (for no one was ever so mad as to think fire and ice to be one), Leucippus, therefore, pursued a line of reasoning which was in accordance with sensation, and which was not irreconcil- able with the production and decay, the motion and multitude of things." 4 Consistent with his support of Atomism is his opposition to the Eleatics, and Pythagoreans. The Eleatic philosophy, he affirms, does not conform to facts. It explains away the changes that go on in everything around us. Speaking of the Pythagoreans, Aristotle says: " Further, they construct a second earth in opposi- tion to our own, which they call the counter-earth, and therein they do not look for theories and explanations, but corrupt the facts in reference to certain theories and favourite opinions,5 and thus, it may be said, they display themselves as co-operators in the creation of the universe." 6 Without reference to the facts of experience, Aristotle could never have achieved what he did in the realm of natural history. In the treatises Historia Animalium, On Colours, On Sounds, he collected a large number of facts. The first of these, for which 1 See De Part. An., I, 5. 2 See An. Prior., I, 30. 3 See An.

The same necessity for collecting facts is recognised in his Ethics, Politics, and Physics. "Some of Aristotle's most important researches must be entirely original. For instance, he must have traced the development of the embryo chicken with his own eyes." 2 And then there are " his two great anatomical discoveries, the central position of the heart in the vascular system, and the possession of a backbone by all red- blooded animals."3 Nor was Aristotle ignorant of experiment, although he does not employ it frequently. Lewes gives one or two examples,4 all taken from physiology. Aristotle does not mention experiments in any other branch of science. It was Aristotle's belief that truth resulted from a comparison of varied popular views.5 What was generally credited must have some firm foundation. The opinions of yvwipptaot, i.e., those specially acquainted with any subject, are prima facie likely to be correct in relation to that subject.6 He realises, however, the danger of inaccuracy in all 'opinion.' He is not always successful in avoiding such danger. It seems impossible that one man should have collected at first hand all the facts of nature recorded in his numerous writings. He must have accepted the great majority of them from popular tradition with little or no further examination. His analysis of 6vSota was not sufficiently critical. And Bacon seems a little too gen- erous when he says: "Wherein the wisdom and integrity of Aristotle is worthy to be observed;, that having made so diligent and exquisite a history of living creatures, hath mingled it spar- ingly with any vain or feigned matter . . . excellently discern- ing that matter of manifest truth, such whereupon observation and rule was to be built, was not to be mingled or weakened with 1 See Ellis and Spedding, Bacon's Works, 1857, Vol. III, p. 288.-Advance- ment of Learning. 2 Benn, Greek Philosophers, i882, Vol. I, p. 327. 3 Ibid., Vol. I, p. 328.

XXXI. matter of doubtful credit." 1 Aristotle accepted the popular Em- pedoclean doctrine of the four elements and the commonly re- ceived notions of gravity and levity. In opposition to the true view of Pythagoras he held to the popular belief that the earth was the centre of the universe. He rejected the 'vacuum' of the Atomists. Aristotle is also greatly influenced by the common use of lan- guage. He uses words in their popular acceptation without mak- ing any attempt to circumscribe their meaning scientifically. Thus it is the 'nature' of light things to rise, and of heavy things to fall, light things seeking their kindred nature in the heavens, and heavy things their kindred nature in the earth. Popular distinc- tions are identified with objective truth. Aristotle's frequent apriorism is reducible to the acceptance on his part of inaccurate popular distinctions and to inaccurate dis- tinctions of his own making. Take, for example, his rejection of the indivisible atom. According to Aristotle, body to be body must be regarded as divisible, therefore the existence of atoms (i.e., small bodies) was impossible. The concept (i.e., body) from which he reasoned deductively (i.e., in a priori fashion) was in- accurate. Reasoning from the same concept, he concluded er- roneously that it is impossible for all bodies to fall with equal velocities. The heart is in the centre of the body-Aristotle rushed to the conclusion that it is therefore the seat of sensation. What, then, was the function of the brain? It was supposed to counteract the heat of the heart. And so absurdity follows ab- surdity. Aristotle frequently 'rushes to conclusions.' Man, horse, mule do not exhaust the class of bileless animals.2 For example, the elephant is bileless. Moreover, man is not bileless. Lewes in his Aristotle gives further examples of rash generalisations.3 There is one rash generalization in particular which infects his whole philosophy. He concludes that all natural phenomena are interpretable in the light of final causes. Reasoning deductively 1 Ellis &amp; Spedding, op. cit., Vol. III, p. 288.-Advancement of Learning. 2 See An.

The formation of individual living things is "teleologically determined by the parental type which they are striving to realise. . . . And he' goes on to censure Em- pedocles for saying that many things in the animal body are due simply to mechanical causation; for example, the segmented structure of the backbone, which that philosopher attributes to continued doubling and twisting-the very same explanation, we believe, that would be given of it by a modern evolutionist." 2 " To Aristotle the unbroken regularity of the celestial movements, which to us is the best proof of their purely mechanical nature, was, on the contrary, a proof that they were produced and di- rected by an absolutely reasonable purpose." 3 According to Aristotle, "the reason why the heart, in man, inclines slightly towards the left side is that it may temper the greater coldness of that side. It is needless to observe that the left side of man is not colder than the right." ' "It is a fact that normally in turtles and exceptionally in elephants, horses, and oxen, there is an ossification of the septum of the heart. Aristotle saw or heard of one of these 'bones' in the hearts of a horse and an ox, and forthwith generalised the observation thus: 'The heart is desti- tute of bones except in horses and in a species of ox; these, however, in consequence of their size, have something bony as a support just as we find throughout the whole body.'

Without reference to the final causes of the valves in the veins, Harvey would, perhaps, never have been able to dis- cover the circulation of the blood. But the employment of final causes in the solution of biological problems is quite different from their employment in the solution of physical problems. Life in- volves a distinction of kind. Even in physical problems, however, a reference to final causes is frequently illuminating. It is the function of a watch to record fixed intervals of time-once this is understood, we are better able to appreciate the significance of each part of its mechanism. Be that as it may, a limit must be placed to the use of final causes. What that limit is may be doubtful, but this at least is certain-that Aristotle transgresses it, for we have already seen the frequent error in which the use of final causes has involved him. Very frequently in Aristotle's practice final causes are alone advanced, and immediate, proximate causes neglected. Aristotle does not argue from final causes to the existence of a creative God previously existing and external to the universe. The universe has existed from all eternity. Marks of design in the universe are explained by Aristotle's 'Nature.' ' Nature ' works toward an end, does nothing in vain, " does not act with conscious prevision,"2 is "an indwelling power which pervades all things," 3"the instinct of the universe," 4 a dens ex machine, and an enigma. While rash generalization without verification involves, as we have seen, for example, in Aristotle's use of final causes, a ten- dency to frequent error, it implies one thing indispensable to inductive procedure, viz., hypothesis. " Sagacity (&amp;ayyXvota) ," says Aristotle,r " is a certain happy extempore conjecture ( vo-roXt- arv; ) of the middle term, as if a man perceiving that the moon always has that part lustrous which is towards the sun, should 1Quoted by Gomperz, op. cit., Vol. IV,,p.

In the first type of Aristotle's induction, hypothesis is again recognized. There, as we saw, an advance is made from some particulars to a universal. The universal extends beyond the particulars. That universal is, therefore, a hypothesis. If there is one thing in particular which distinguishes Aristotle's scientific achievement, it is his powers of classification. This is specially evident in his classification of facts of natural history. Now classification implies hypothesis, several facts more or less unlike being grouped under one idea. II. For an understanding of Bacon's inductive method it is neces- sary to say something at once of what he means by 'simple natures.' These were limited in number, distinct in kind from one another, and ultimate. Every sense-object is reducible to a combination of certain of these simple natures. Just as a limited number of letters go to make up the infinite variety of worlds, so simple natures go to make up the infinite variety of natural phenomena. A happy characteristic distinguishing Bacon from Aristotle 1i the former's sceptical attitude towards popular opinion. Aris- totle, indeed, did, as we have already noticed, appreciate the vague and misleading character of popular distinctions, but this apprecia- tion was no essential part of his philosophy as was the exposition of idola part of Bacon's. Consequently Bacon recognises the dif- ficulty of attaining to simple natures defined with scientific accuracy. Meantime they are vague, indistinct, inaccurate no- tions-idolac fori. Bacon promises aids to the attainment of 'bonc, notiones' but this promise he never fulfils.' Closely connected with his use of 'simple natures' is his use of 'forms.' By 'form' Bacon means the particular principle of corpuscular structure 2 on which a 'simple nature' depends. Thus he endeavour 4 to find the form of heat which is a simple 'See Nov. Org., II, i9.

He employs methods of exclusion, and aims at an abso- lutely certain result. Such and such a form is present where no heat is, is absent where heat is, varies without a corresponding variation of heat-therefore that form is not the form of heat. It is excluded. So with other forms. But there is a limited number of forms, i.e., of principles of corpuscular structure. Now heat in omnimnoda materia et subjects susceptibili'- has, ultimately, but one form, which alone remains as the cause of heat. All the others have been excluded. It is obvious that the Method of Exclusions is inapplicable un- less we are acquainted with all possible forms. How we are to attain such a knowledge Bacon has not succeeded in showing us, any more than he has succeeded in showing us how to attain a knowledge of all possible simple natures clearly defined. Be that as it may, it is sufficient for our purpose to point out that the Baconian method of induction is not essentially distinct from the Aristotelian. Aristotle's second type of induction pro- ceeds upon the principle of complete enumeration, and conse- quently involves complete exclusion also. Bacon's method pro- ceeds upon the principle of complete exclusion. In Aristotle there is an exhaustion of positive instances, in Bacon there is an ex- haustion of negative instances. In both absolute certainty of induction was the aim. And the positive instances of Aristotle and the negative in- stances of Bacon are both referable to form. For Aristotle's Inductive Syllogism it is necessary to exhaust types or species. And, in Aristotelian metaphysics, types or species are forms. 'The Baconian inductive method proceeds by excluding all forms but one, which is the form of the simple nature investigated. The same difficulties attach to both Aristotle's Inductive Syl- logism and the Baconian inductive method. It does not seem possible at any time to divide nature into a fixed number of forms, as both methods require. Knowledge is dynamic and further forms may be discovered. Bacon, perhaps, implicitly recognised this possibility. "Jam vero tempus est, ut artem ipsam inter- pretandi naturam proponamus . . . tamen necessitated ei abso- 1 Op. cit., II, 17.</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] COMPARISON OF ARISTOTLE AND BACON. 48i lutam . . . aut etiam perf ectionem non attribuimus." The future may see a change in even the method of discovery. "Xlrtem invepniendi cum inventis adolescere posse, stattere de- beis." '- 1 Bacon owed to Aristotle his use of form, and his employment of the concept clearly reflects the source. Such and such a mode of motion is the form of heat, says Bacon, i.e., such and such a mode of motion is the cause of heat, i.e., heat is defined by its cause. Now Aristotle too defines by cause. "The knowledge of the what is the same as the knowledge of the why."12 "But what is thunder ?-the sound of fire extinguished in the clouds." ' So much for Bacon's inductive method of exclusions. The difficulties involved-difficulties already noted-were not to be overcome. Consequently, we find Bacon latterly laying great stress on the inductive value of Natural History. " For a small and well-ordered Natural History is the Key of all knowledge and operation." 4Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum is an example of this recourse to Natural History. Inspired probably by the same spirit as Aristotle when he wrote his Historia Animalium, Bacon does not here show the same power of classification as the Greek philosopher. The Sylva Sylvarum is certainly not " well-ordered." On the other hand Bacon himself recognises this defect. "I have heard his lordship say, that if he should have served the glory of his own name, he had better not to have published this Natural History; for it may seem an indigested heap of par- ticulars, and cannot have that lustre which books cast into methods have; but that he resolves to prefer the good of men, and that which might best secure it, before anything that might have rela- tion to himself."5 Bacon's reliance, latterly, on Natural History peculiarly em- phasises the importance he always attached to observation of the facts of experience. By such observation he frequently distin- 1 Nov. Org. I, 130. Italics mine. 2 An.

[VOL. XXXI. guishes himself ' from the apriorism of ancient science, which we have seen many times exemplified in Aristotle's writings. Apri- orism is condemned as 'anticipations of the mind'-idola. In regard to the experience crystallised in popular opinion Bacon, like Aristotle, recognised dangers and subjects it to this limita- tion "Verus enim consensus is est, qui ex libertate judicii (re prius explorata) in idem conveniente consistit." 2 Also like Aris- totle, and for the same reasons, Bacon finds praise for the atomis- tic school of Democritus.3 Again like Aristotle, Bacon emphasises the need to observe common, trvial, mean things in nature. "Neque propterea polluitur naturalis historia; sol enim aeque palatia et cloacas ingreditur, neque tamen polluitur." 4 Unlike Aristotle, Bacon succeeds in avoiding the apriorism which sepa- rates celestial from terrestrial phenomena.5 To the former the four elements were sufficient to explain terrestrial phenomena, but the dignity of the stars required a fifth element, i.e., quintes- sence. While both Aristotle and Bacon emphasise attention to the facts of experience, the facts observed by Aristotle are usually of a different nature from those observed by Bacon. Aristotle was a biologist, Bacon a physicist. Aristotle observed the charac- teristics of organic bodies, animals and plants; Bacon observed the characteristics of inorganic bodies. Aristotle, unlike Bacon, failed in any way to foreshadow the modern science of chem- istry.6 Constant in his realisation of the importance of observing the facts of experience, Bacon likes to compare sciences to pyramids rising from the broad plain of empirical fact. "There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general I See Nov.

And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried."1 Thus, according to Bacon, the discovery of the lowest principles by induction of particulars precedes the discovery of the middle principles and the discovery of the middle principles precedes the discovery of the highest principles. The process of discovery is represented by Bacon's Three Min- istrations.2 Aristotle taught that knowledge had its beginning in the senses. Sense-experiences are retained in the mind-hence next enters memory. Sense-experiences of the same kind, re- peated, produce experience. And from experience arises the appreciation of the universal by voivw or reason. Bacon's Three Ministrations follow the same order. They are the Ministration to the Senses, the Ministration to the Memory, the Ministration to the Mind or Reason. But in contrast to Aristotle, Bacon does not allow the same spontaneity to the action of reason. The mechanical certainty of his method forbids. "Still the under- standing, if left to itself and its own spontaneous movements, is incompetent and unfit to form axioms, unless it be directed and guarded." 3 In Nov. Org., II, I5, Bacon seems quite definitely to oppose Aristotle's doctrine of the spontaneous action of No'vg as giving truth. "To God, truly, the Giver and Architect of Forms, and it may be to the angels and higher intelligences, it belongs to have an affirmative knowledge of forms immediately, and from the first contemplation. But this assuredly is more than man can do, to whom it is granted only to proceed at first by negatives, and at last to end in affirmatives, after exclusion has been exhausted." 4 1 Nov. Org., I, i9.

XXXT Bacon so emphasizes attention to the concrete facts of objective experience that he fails to appraise the subjective at its proper value-in other words, he fails to recognise fully the value of hypothesis in inductive procedure. Now we have already seen how Aristotle's tendency to 'rash generalization' implies his recog- nition of hypothesis. Bacon tends by reaction to the other ex- treme, to over-emphasise the dangers of generalization, and to omit hypothesis altogether. "Men fly from the senses and par- ticulars direct to most general axioms,1 as to fixed poles round which disputations turn; and from these everything else is de- rived by means of middle terms :2 a short way, certainly, but precipitous; one which Nature cannot tread, though easy and smooth for Disputations." 3 Unlike Aristotle, Bacon does not (formally, at least) recognise the sagacity necessary to the formation of hypotheses. He con- sidered his method independent of such a faculty. "But the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level. For as in the draw- ing of a straight line or a perfect circle much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand, if it be done by aim of hand only, but if with the aid of rule or compass, little or nothing; so is it exactly with my plan." The reason why Bacon refuses to recognise the value of the formation of hypothesis is to be found in his estimate of the trustworthiness of the human intellect. " Though all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their might have held that an "immediate affirmative knowledge of forms" could belong not only to God but also to man. Yet, like Aristotle, Bacon distin- guishes between the sensible and rational souls. The former is naturally produced, material, shared by the brute creation, proceeding 'e matricibus ele- mentorum'; the latter comes to man (and to man only) from without and is of divine origin.

But Bacon was not a sceptic. Like Des- cartes, he doubted not for its own sake but so as to reach truth. And, most of all, he doubted, in opposition to Scholasticism, the ipse dixit of Aristotelian authority. Bacon's distrust sometimes tends to overreach itself. If " radical errors in the first con- coction of the mind are not to be cured," does not Bacon veto the possibility of reaching truth, not only by hypothesis but, so long as activity of intellect in some mode is necessary to knowledge, by any means whatever? Strictly, is not his own philosophy of discovery already refuted? Bacon's neglect of hypothesis is further seen in his view of the relation of fact and theory. For the speedy advancement of scientific knowledge, Bacon proposed a division of labour. Let observers collect facts. Let theorists evolve the laws governing the facts. Now modern science has taught that fact and theory cannot be severed in this way. A 'working hypothesis' is neces- sary. With it we select the facts necessary for its proof or dis- proof. This selection of facts affords a greater economy of effort than Bacon, who supposed natural phenomena limited, in- stead of infinite, in number, could have held. Referring to Bacon's method of procedure in connection with the investigation of heat, Craik has said that that method "sets out simply with a blind accumulation of instances, no more col- lected under the guidance of any kind of anticipation or hypothesis than are the fishes, great and small, that the net brings up when cast into the sea." 3 This is untrue. Bacon's method involves Three Tables of Instances. These Tables are formed under the guidance of three corresponding principles. And these principles are, as it were, hypotheses as to the best general mode of induc- I.e., hypotheses. 2 Nov.

XXXI. tion, though not hypotheses as to the nature of heat in particular. In Nov. Org., I, io6, Bacon seems to recognise the modern scien- tific view of the relation of induction, hypothesis, deduction, and verification. " But in establishing axioms by this kind of induc- tion, we must also examine and try whether the axiom so estab- lished be framed to the measure of those particulars only from which it is derived, or whether it be larger and wider.' And if it be larger and wider, we must observe whether by indicating to us new particulars it confirm that wideness and largeness as by a collateral security;2 that we may not either stick fast in things already known, or loosely grasp at shadows and abstract forms; not at things solid and realised in matter." It is difficult to rea- lise the necessity for this verification of hypothesis by deduction of particulars in a method which, by exhaustive exclusion of instances, arrives at axioms with mechanical certainty. So far, we have noticed, in connection with Bacon's formal inductive method of exclusions, cases where he seems to have recognised the value of hypothesis. There are also cases outside that method. Take, for example, his "First Vintage concerning the Form of Heat." 3 First Vintage is an 'essay,' an " indulgence of the understanding," a hypothesis as to the nature of heat. Prerogative Instances are fortiora auxilia in usum intellectus 4 and therefore outwith Bacon's formal method. Like the Three Tables of Instances, differences in prerogative are determined by different principles which are, as it were, hypotheses as to the best general mode of induction. A Crucial Instance5 serves to decide which of two hypotheses shall be accepted. Speaking of Instances Conformable,6 Bacon seems to recognise the sagacity necessary for the formation of hypotheses. "In fine, a certain sagacity in investigating and hunting out Physical Conformities 1 I.e., partakes of the nature of a hypothesis. 2 " New particulars " are deduced from the hypothesis. If experience veri- fies these particulars, the hypothesis is established. 3 See Nov.

It is possible to draw further significant comparisons between Aristotle's and Bacon's philosophies of nature. " For to say that the hairs of the eyelids are for a quickset and fence about the sight; or that the firmness of the skins and hides of living crea- tures is to defend them from the extremities of heat and cold, . . . and the like, is well enquired and collected in Metaphysic; but in Physic they are impertinent. . . . Not because these final causes are not true, and worthy to be enquired, being kept within their own province; but because their excursions into the limits of physical causes hath bred a vastness and solitude in that track. . . . For the cause rendered, that the hairs about the eyelids are for the safeguard of the sight, doth not impugn the cause ren- dered, that pilosity is incident to orifices of moisture . . . ; and so of the rest."4 From this passage we can gather Bacon's at- titude towards Final Causes. Their consideration is excluded from physics and relegated to metaphysics. This exclusion is in one-sided opposition to Aristotelian practice.5 Bacon rushes from the error of one extreme to the error of another extreme. Although Bacon separates physical from final causes, he does not consider them inconsistent, the one with the other. As to Aristotle, so to Bacon, the former were the " servants and instru- ments" of the latter, for, Bacon held, final causes necessitate the existence of a God, who realises his purposes through physical causes. Bacon substituted God for Aristotle's Nature, which ' Nov. Org., II, 27 ad fin. Cf. Ellis and Spedding, op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 622f- 623-De Aug.

[VOL. XXXI. must also be considered as realising its purposes through physical causes, as, says the Greek philosopher, " Nature does nothing in vain." 1 Aristotle so far recognised the value of experiment, but Bacon much more so. " And so to meet these evils we, with much and faithful service, have sought out and gathered helps for the Senses from every side; so to supply substitutions where they fail, rectifications where they vary. Nor do we attempt this with Instruments so much as with Experiments. For their subtilty is far greater than that of the Senses, even when aided by exquisite instruments. And so we do not allow much to the immediate and proper perception of the Senses; but make the Senses judge only of Experiments, Experiments of things."2 Consider also Bacon's Experientia Literata.3 It is largely Bacon's clear recog- nition of the value of experiment which makes his philosophy of discovery a distinct advance on that of Aristotle. The progress of natural science depends upon experiment more than upon any other factor. Aristotle observed more than experimented, Bacon did both. Experiment always works under hypothesis. A sci- entist experiments so as to prove or disprove theory. Now Aris- totle implicitly recognized hypothesis but had no adequate ap- preciation of the necessity for verification, and consequently of the necessity for experiment. Bacon recognized hypothesis (most clearly, no doubt, as outside his formal method). But such was that method's fidelity to fact and avoidance of any kind of 'anticipatio mentis,' that once Bacon had in any way recog- nised hypothesis as an aid to discovery, he could not have carried inconsistency so far as to neglect verification. So Bacon recog- nises experiment also. It is true that in practice Bacon sometimes fails to experiment where experiment was necessary. Thus, experiments with the air thermometer, which he mentions in the Novum Organum, would have shown him the absurdity of the old theory, to which, like Aristotle, he still clings, that some things are naturally hot I See supra, p. 478. 2 Kitchin, Nov.

It is true that a great many of the experiments mentioned by Bacon do not seem to have been original. It is true that a great many of the experiments mentioned by Bacon, espe- cially those in Sylvca Sylvuarn,l are crude in character. Never- theless, the supremacy, on the present issue, of Aristotle over Bacon must still be maintained. Another interesting contrast between Aristotle and Bacon is to be found in their respective attitudes towards the senses. Ac- cording to Aristotle, in itself, sensation gives truth.2 It is sig- nificant that vo's, which is always represented as the guarantee of certainty, is frequently likened to a higher sense. Bacon, on the other hand, does not rest satisfied in the immediate informa- tion of the senses, and contrasts himself with 'the logicians' in this regard. " For the senses are also fallacious. ... Where the senses lay hold of a thing, their grasp is not particularly firm. 4 Instances of the Lamp or of first Information are such as aid the senses.5 In spite of Bacon's recognition of Idola Fori, he, like Aristotle, is frequently led astray by the common use of words. Aristotle made no attempt to attach a definite, scientific meaning to the word 'hot,' for example. He did not get beyond the vague meaning attached to that term in popular discourse. Bacon's in- quiry into the nature of heat exhibits the same tendency, albeit that inquiry was designed to reach a scientific result. Thus Bacon assumes that anything called hot is of the same fundamental nature as anything else called hot, e.g., all flame has heat, so also all villous substances, as wool, skins of animals, and down of birds.6 The same supremacy of words accounts for the belief, common to Aristotle and Bacon, that heat and cold are absolute qualities. It accounts, too, for the belief, also common to Aris- totle and Bacon, that natures and appetites are absolute qualities. 1 But see supra, p. 48i, for passage from Rawley. 2 De An., III, 3. 5 Ibid., III, 4; III, 6 ad fin. 4 Kitchin, Nov.

Thus Bacon speaks, for example, of certain bodies being in 'sym- pathy' with certain others, preferring these others as better, etc. Gold, he says again, and other metals in leaf do not 'like' the surrounding air. Paper, too, and cloth, and things of that kind, do not 'get on well' with the air, which is inserted into and mingled with their pores. So they 'gladly' suck in water or other liquid, and drive out the air.1 Like Aristotle, Bacon be- lieved it to be the 'nature' of light bodies to move upwards from the earth's surface, of heavy bodies to move downwards to the earth's surface. And all this notwithstanding Bacon's recognition that "what are called occult and specific properties, or sym- pathies and antipathies, are in great part corruptions of phi- losophy lo; 2 his assertion that " my logic aims to teach and instruct the understanding . . . that it may in very truth dissect nature, and discover the virtues and actions of bodies, with their laws as determined in matter; so that this science flows not merely from the nature of the mind, but also from the nature of things "; 3 and his theoretic avoidance of anthropomorphism in natural science. Aristotle and Bacon are influenced not only by the common use of words but also by popular opinion. Thus, for example, Bacon gives credence to the popular view that the moon has an influence on the weather. Again, both Aristotle and Bacon favoured the popular belief that the earth was the centre of the universe, the former rejecting in his time the true view of Pythagoras, the latter in his time the true view of Copernicus. Aristotle ' and Bacon both rely largely on second-hand informa- tion. In the case of the latter, this is specially evident in Sylva Sylvarum,6 where Bacon " receives, with rare protests and doubts, the records of his authorities, reading and skimming, rather than digesting, Aristotle's 'Problems' and 'Meteorologics,' 1 NoV. Org.. II, 48, vi. For many more examples of natures and appetites regarded as absolute qualities, see, in particular, ibid., 48, viii, xvii, xviii. 2 Ibid., II, 50, vi, 'nit., cf.

There are also evidences of apriorism as traceable to inaccurate distinctions of his own making. Thus, in the De Fluxu et Re- fluxu Maris, "assuming that all things, except the earth, had some westward motion, he supposed that the stars moved quick- est; the higher planets less quickly; the moon less quickly than any of the planets; and the water least quickly of all, thus lagging behind the moon." 2 Bacon assumes also in his astronomical treatises that the air farther from the earth's surface is more rarified than the air nearer the earth's surface. " Since rest must not be taken out of nature, and since compactness of matter (such as we find in the terrene globe), induces aversion to mo- tion, it is reasonable to look for rest in the earth if anywhere. But if there is perfect rest, we must assume there is also perfect mobility; and those bodies which are furthest from the earth will be most perfectly mobile." 3 Bacon, like Aristotle, believed that the most perfect motion was circular. Thus, "Those (bodies) which are favourably placed, if they delight in motion, move in a circle; with a motion, that is, eternal and infinite."' The or- bits of bodies farthest from the earth approximate to circles, the orbits of bodies nearest the earth are spirals, " for," says Bacon, "in proportion as substances degenerate in purity and freedom of development, so do their motions degenerate." 5 There is here exhibited not only Bacon's belief in circular as the most perfect motion, but also the slightest modification of the Aristotelian doctrine which required, in the interests of dignity, the move- ments of all heavenly bodies to be circular. And many more examples of this kind of apriorism could be given. What, now, is the comparison Bacon himself draws between his own and Aristotle's inductive method?

And they express much the same views as Aristotle himself held. Aristotle never be- lieved that certainty attached to the induction of dialectic and he clearly recognised the possibility of a contradictory instance. They are virtually applicable also to Aristotle's first kind of in- duction, the induction supposed to find verification in vovs. Aristotle never showed in accordance with what principles vois added its final authority. Are not many of Aristotle's theories of nature, presumably ratified by voi3l, as a matter of fact false? Bacon's observations are not applicable, of course, to Aristotle's second kind of induction, the Inductive Syllogism. Indeed we have already seen the close resemblance to it of Bacon's own formal method. Even in the case of the Inductive Syllogism there recurs the difficulty attaching to moi3s. Whom can this faculty now persuade that bilelessness is the cause of longevity? As a result of our detailed comparison of the philosophies of discovery of Aristotle and Bacon, what general result do we reach? Aristotle collects facts, so does Bacon. Aristotle seems to realise the value of hypothesis, so does Bacon. Aristotle ex- perimented, so did Bacon. Aristotle and Bacon realise the danger of 'opinion,' yet accept it often too uncritically. Aristotle and Bacon indulge in aprioristic argument, although both profess to prefer fact to 'reasoning'. In regard to actual discovery, Bacon does not seem to hold much, if any, advantage over Aristotle. Bacon anticipated the modern theory of heat as a mode of motion, and, because of the phenomena of friction, rightly rejected the long held notion that 1 Ellis and Spedding, op. cit., Vol. III, p. 6o8-Cogitata et visa. 2 Kitchin, Nov.

His opinion that colour is a modification of the rays of light 2 is felicitous. He refers con- stantly in the New Atlantis to the value of the microscope. Speaking of Sylva Sylvarum, I, Nichol says: "Nowhere do we find a closer approximation to the true conception of the law of gravity than when it is stated that it worketh more weakly as it recedes from the earth, 'because the appetite of union with dense bodies is made more dull by distance.' "3 Just as Aristotle made many valuable biological observations, so did Bacon make many valuable botanical observations. Nicol again, referring to Sylva Sylvzarum, V, VI, VII, says that Bacon's 'Georgics of the Earth' "show the almost unparalled range of his interests, and relate to a subject he had really studied and they have called forth the enthusiastic praise of modern botanists." 4 In Nov. Org., II, 45, 48 (9), Bacon recognises the probable or possible influence of the moon on tides. But over against these favourable instances of Bacon's achievements in discovery (the number could be conr- siderably increased) are to be set instances unfavourable. Thus, he still clings to the old theory that some things are naturally hot and others cold. He erroneously believed that the moon's rays are devoid of heat.5 He is wrong when he says that metal becomes warm more slowly than air, oil, and water; when he says that cold contracts all bodies.7 His theory of windmills in the Historia Ventorum reveals "looseness of mind." 8 Iron is not ultimate in hardness,9 as the diamond is harder than iron. "The want of attention to the discoveries of Galileo made him commit himself to an opposition (the more pronounced as he grew older) against the Copernican theory of astronomy." 10 Aristotle held in opposition to Empedocles that the transmission i See Nov.

In regard to Bacon's dis- coveries, "the record of his definite mistakes is greater than that of his achievements,"3 possibly because he had not so much the analytic as the synthetic mind.4 But to Bacon's advantage, and despite discrepancies between theory and practice, it seems clear that he had a much more vivid appreciation than Aristotle of the absolute necessity in discovery of paying strict attention to the objective facts of experience. It is this spirit which accounts for Bacon's strong emphasis on ex- periment; it is this spirit which accounts for healthy doubt and the clearly defined doctrine of idola; it is this spirit which dis- tinguishes all fruitful scientific endeavour and which, because of Bacon's teaching, became thereafter increasingly manifest. Aris- totle constantly rushes, after mere enumeration of chance in- stances, to general conclusions which no vovs can validate. Bacon selects instances, and herein is to be found another distinguishing mark between ancient and modern scientific method. WILLIAM M. DICKIE.
