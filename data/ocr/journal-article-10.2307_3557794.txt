<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pacific Affairs: Fall 2001 he finds many of these bases lacking and most unable to connect to the Aboriginal ethos, rooted as they are in notions of labour on the land, situation on the land, and historical connection to the land. Even an aesthetic sense of the land seems to lack an Aboriginal dimension. Hence his conclusion that non-Aboriginal Australians must find their own path. But, I wonder, why opt for a separation in accommodation before fully exploring the Aboriginal sense of belonging in all its complex dimensions? Before seeing its implications for human interrelations, whether Aboriginal, non-Aboriginal, or any other human grouping? I would have begun with Ted Strehlow and his Journey to Horseshoe Bend, certainly the finest non- Aboriginal account of the Australian landscape through Aboriginal eyes. Or is Strehlow still persona non grata among the politically correct in Australian intellectual circles? Perhaps Strehlow's story ended badly, but he ventured where Read says Australians have yet to go. He showed that it is possible to bridge the gap between the cultures through a mode of perception learned from Aboriginal teachers and confirmed through one's own life experiences. I have glimpsed this myself over thirty years revisiting the Aboriginal peoples of Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island, enough to know that once you have seen through "Aboriginal" eyes, you see wherever you happen to be - the outback of Australia, my home in the Ottawa valley of Canada - and understand that theirs is a vision that transcends time, place and culture. University of Toronto, Canada DAVID H. TURNER EMPLACED MYTH: Space, Narrative, and Knowledge in Aboriginal Australia and Papua New Guinea. Edited by Alan Rumsey andJames E Weine. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press. 2001. vii, 281 pp. (Diagrams.) US$27.95, paper ISBN 0-8248-2389-3. New Guinea and Australia were once connected and originally peopled as one landmass. This edited volume is an important step in reuniting, for the anthropological gaze, indigenous models of human identities with country in these two lands rent by rising seas in deep prehistory. Central are Melanesian and Aboriginal beliefs about and means of mapping places, primarily in the form of narratives of ancestral wanderings that resulted in either the origin of geographic features and groups, or the origin of human knowledge of them. Although not explicitly stated, the authors analyze characteristically religious ways of relating to places. The relationship between people and land is often understood to be far deeper than metaphor, in which the land stands for the group, or metonym, in which the land and people are part of one another. Rather, we see situations in which country and people are one: instead of proxy there is full identity. For many of the peoples described, people are places, objects and totems, and vice versa. 466</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Beyond landforms, people recognize spiritually significant paths linking places and humans, in which space and time are conflated. Alan Rumsey argues that in both Aboriginal Australia and Melanesia these are imagined not like trees but like rhizomes, capable of reconnecting and not necessarily hierarchically organized (p. 22). Jiirg Wassmann describes Nyaura knotted cords used in recalling secret relationships between mythical migrations and clan names. He shows interconnections between religious secrecy and myth forms in which time is congealed by being placed in a spatial model of the past, centered on contemporary concerns. Roy Wagner points to the anthropomorphic quality of all kinds of "maps" that contain stories of how they were made. Here traveling is central to describing place, the landscape is embodied, and the human body is projected onto the land. Pamela J. Stewart and Andrew Strathern compare Aboriginal and Melanesian myths, characterizing the former as tending to relate to "origins" of permanent conditions of existence and the latter as describing the "creation" of new situations in the historical past. Deborah Bird Rose compares notions of nature versus culture among Victoria River Desert Aborigines and the Melanesian Kaulong. While Aborigines have a mutual caring relationship with the world, Kaulong separate human gardens and clearings from the natural bush, resulting in different environmental ethics for the two groups. Anthony Redmond redresses static images of Aboriginal Dreamtimes by considering Ngarinyin myths of mobile landforms.James F Weiner considers similarities in the contested secrecies of Ngarrindjeri women and the Australian government in the 1995 controversy over the "secret women's business" advanced by Aboriginal women in response to plans to build a bridge. Andrew Lattas describes a cargo cult in West New Britain whose members draw on capitalistic images of money and believe companies' wealth to be secretly produced by subterranean Americans beneath their own ground. Eric Kline Silverman brings literacy, secrecy, gender and tourist art into his comparison of Eastern Iatmul and Australian Aboriginal totemism and mythological time. Finally, Lissant Bolton discusses recent developments in museum practices in Australia and Melanesia. She contrasts Indigenous ideas of place-linked, spiritually powerful objects with the European focus on artifacts as representations of groups' ways of life. As Weiner points out in his afterword, the links between land and myth in these cultures is striking. Many of these features are also found elsewhere; I hope this book inspires more intensive comparisons of religiously conceived human-geographic relationships, to reveal general characteristics of mental modeling of identity and place. I also hope that my fellow anthropologists will do so without the obfuscating language that so unnecessarily marred some of the papers in this volume. The College of Wooster Woos W ter, Ohio, U.S.A.
