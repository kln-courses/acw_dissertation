      <p>This book represents a compilation of the author’s previous articles, with some taken from edited volumes, and others from primary journals. The book is separated into five main sections, with essays preceding each section. The volume also contains a foreword by Jane Goodall. The topics that are covered range from basic data on the ecology and behavior of mammals (Section II) to human influences on animal behavior (Section IV) to the role of ethics when studying animals (Section V). Examples of individual chapters include studies of human effects on black‐tailed prairie dogs, the population ecology of coyotes, and the role of scent marking.</p>
      <p>Bekoff has become well‐known for advocating an “ethical” approach to studying behavioral ecology, and this compilation appears to be another attempt to further this viewpoint. The author promotes several themes throughout the book. First, scientists should not distance themselves from their subjects (in his case, largely mammals, particularly coyotes, on which much of the volume focuses), but should rather “insert” themselves into the lives of their subjects. Second, scientists should “tread lightly” while conducting research, and be aware that animal or habitat manipulation can profoundly affect animal behavior and well‐being. Next, research in behavioral ecology should aim to understand what it “means” to be an animal (e.g., a coyote), most obviously by putting oneself in the place or “mindset” of the animal. And, finally, animals have “morals” and “ethics” just like humans, and also exhibit a sense of “fair play.” Many other ideas are covered, but they all can be related to these four primary themes.</p>
      <p>Bekoff has established himself as an excellent researcher in behavioral ecology. He has made strong contributions to our understanding of the ecology and behavior of carnivores (among other study organisms), and this book is a nice review of his past work. His rallying cries for greater attention to animal ethics by scientists are certainly justified. One of the greatest lessons over the past 30 or so years has been the sophistication of animal responses to seemingly subtle human disturbance. The author underscores this point through numerous compelling examples of how seemingly innocuous human behaviors can profoundly change how animals behave. He is correct to point out that the public is becoming increasingly interested in the behavior of scientists, and the era of science “removed” from politics is over, although one could argue that this breaking of barriers is coming primarily from the conservative right rather than from the political left. Bekoff builds a convincing case that scientists must understand the larger social and political ramifications of their research. Hardly a field biologist exists today that does not have a story about how their study organism is affected by human development. Readers who are generally interested in the topics of animal rights and the ethics of conducting science on animals should certainly read this book because many of the author’s ideas are both provocative and highly relevant. For example, one of Bekoff’s most interesting points is that, in some cases, the cost of studying a particular animal may not be worth the benefit, something that many research scientists would consider unacceptable.</p>
      <p>There are, however, several aspects of this compilation that were unsatisfying. First and foremost, there is relatively little that is new in this book. Many of the chapters are themselves chapters from prior compilations. The introductory chapters for each section are new, and are the most provocative, but they generally lack the background research that is needed to make a convincing argument. Indeed, readers can easily access these same ideas in his previously published papers and book chapters. Second, Bekoff seems to contradict himself by first criticizing individuals who argue that animals are only valuable if they measure up to human standards of intelligence, but then proceeding to spend much of the book arguing that animals do exhibit “human‐like” behaviors (morality, fair play). On the first point, I suspect that many researchers would agree. Biological organisms are notable for their amazing diversity of behavior, and one should not judge the value of an organism based solely on how similar they are to humans. However, this first critique is undermined by the author’s argument that animals have “ethics” and “morals” much like humans, and therefore deserve the same kinds of “rights” afforded humans. This argument seems to work fairly well for some of the large, intelligent carnivores that Bekoff works on (e.g., coyotes), but falls flat for the vast majority of remaining biological diversity (e.g., plants, reptiles, birds, and microorganisms, among others). Indeed, I found his arguments about animal “morality” and “fair play” to be hardly representative of the vast majority of animal behavior. For example, I would not call the behavior of male lizards toward one another during the peak of the breeding season to be “moral” in any sense of the word. Similarly, his ideas of “play” seem hardly relevant beyond mammals, and it was disappointing that he did not attempt to address the issue of play in a broader comparative context. In his effort to promote the view that animals have a sense of “fair play” and morality, he generally ignores the vast body of published literature that shows animals often engage in highly competitive, seemingly nasty, and sometimes downright destructive behavior toward one another. This is not to argue that animal behavior is more competitive or aggressive than human behavior; a simple review of our own bloody history will disabuse anyone of that notion.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Bekoff missed an important opportunity to justify animal rights based not on anthropomorphism, but on the inherent beauty of biological diversity, particularly in regard to behavior. This is a point that could have been well‐received; animals are not always “moral” like humans (sometimes) are. However, just because sharks bite one another, and male lions sometimes kill other male offspring does not make them any less worthy of conservation than a coyote that seems to play fair. In fact, the author’s view implies that we should only conserve animals that meet the human standard of morality, which is, ironically, how conservation efforts are largely proceeding today, with much of the emphasis being placed on large mammals and birds, and only an afterthought being given to other equally important groups. Obviously, Bekoff does not promote this latter view, but one could argue that it follows logically from his argument that animals are more complex, intelligent, and moral (and implicitly more valuable) than we give them credit for.</p>
      <p>Bekoff has highlighted the concept that researchers should be kind to animals, both in the field and in the laboratory, and I agree with this point. I imagine that the vast majority of biologists who study animals for nonapplied reasons got into the field because they loved animals, and hence this concept will likely resonate with many researchers. The author correctly notes that in the rush to be as impartial as possible, we often lose sight of the fact that we are working with living, breathing organisms that deserve our love and respect. However, he fails to make a convincing argument for animal rights based on concepts of “fair play” and “morality.” Animals deserve our love and respect for many reasons, but not primarily because they are nice to one another.</p>
