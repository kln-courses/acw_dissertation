Muzzy, C. Dee Gragg, Robert E. Schmidt, and Edwin M. Trout 6570th Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio CRASH SAFETY EXPERTS have long advocated the efficacy of occupant restraints for automobiles and aircraft. Although the lap belt can significantly reduce the incidence of impact fatalities by preventing ejection from the vehicle, this restraint cannot always eliminate lethal head contact with the relatively nonyielding windshield or instrument panel (1).* Note: The research reported in this paper was conducted by personnel of the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

ABSTRACT The tolerance to abrupt linear deceleration (~GX) and im- pact trauma patterns resulting from the use of the Air Force shoulder harness-lap belt restraint were investigated. Eighty- nine deceleration tests were performed with 37 adult male baboons. Peak sled decelerations ranged from 6.5-134 g. The stopping distance varied from 0.5-3.5 ft at 6 in increments. LD^qS were calculated to be 102, 103, and 98 g for the 0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 ft stopping distances, respectively. Since the de- celeration pulses were similar, the results imply that for the exposure range of these tests, impact lethality is dependent upon magnitude of peak sled deceleration, irrespective of the pulse duration, sled velocity, or stopping distance. At all stopping distances, the primary cause of death was lower brainstem or cervical spinal cord trauma. The pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic injury patterns were significantly dif- ferent at the various stopping distances. Animals impacted at the 0.5 ft stop typically displayed no significant injuries other than head-neck trauma. The predominant injuries at the 2.0 ft stop included pelvic and abdominal myorrhexis, intestinal her- niation, urinary bladder rupture, and pelvic fractures in addi- tion to luxation of cervical through thoracic vertebrae. At the 3.5 stop animals received extensive muscular and skeletal in- juries of the pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic regions. Brain- stem hemorrhage was a significant finding, but there was no evidence of luxation or fractures of cervical vertebrae. 2898</page><page sequence="2">Since World War II, military aviators have used a restraint consisting of a lap belt incorporated with a torso harness. This system not only reduces torso and head contact with the cock- pit interior under survivable crash conditions, but also securely restrains the aviator during routine flight or combat maneu- vers. The principal function of the harness is the prevention of torso hyperflexion during impact (2); the capability of pilots to tolerate greater decelerative force is secondary. In 1952, relying upon accident-injury reports of single- engine aircraft crashes, De Haven showed that fatal or non- fatal injuries occurred six times more frequently when shoul- der harness restraints were not used (3). This important and pioneering monograph contributed significantly to the adop- tion of the shoulder harness-lap belt restraint in private and commercial aircraft. Likewise, more recent articles have con- tributed to the mandatory installation of shoulder belt re- straints in all production automobiles (4, 5). Although many investigators are pursuing the course of dy- namic response analysis of safety harnesses (6, 7), the protec- tive effectiveness of the shoulder harness-lap belt restraint re- mains incompletely documented. Snyder's comprehensive restraint evaluation included only one impact test (34 lb baboon at 20 g) with a full torso harness (8). Numerous dummy and human tests (9-13) have documented the loading characteristics of the harness system by emphasizing its bene- ficial distribution of force to the torso and pelvis. However, in most tests, the peak vehicle decelerations were far below the maximum capability or potential of the restraint. Limited in- formation can be garnered from aviation pathology reports since many accidents are catastrophic with massive disruption of cockpit integrity. Furthermore, only fragmentary data can be gathered from automobile accident reports because of the dismaying public apathy or, indeed, rejection of shoulder belt usage. In a recent report, the protective capabilities of the Air Force shoulder harness-lap belt were compared with the lap belt only and the airbag plus lap belt in controlled animal ex- periments (14). Although the safety potential of the harness at excessive decelerations is less than that of the airbag for a frontal impact (14), the superior cost effectiveness and sensi- bility of the harness restraint dictate the need for its further evaluation. Using baboons, the principal objectives of this study were to determine tolerance limits at various stopping distances during exposure to abrupt linear deceleration ("G ) and to investigate impact trauma patterns resulting from the use of the Air Force shoulder harness-lap belt restraint. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-nine deceleration tests were performed with 37 adult male baboons (Papio anubis) weighing 43-58 lb (20-26 kg). The LC^q was the sled deceleration level where impact fatali- ties were expected in 50% of the animals. The tolerance to impact (LD^q) was determined by sequential testing: each successive baboon was impacted at a 10 g increment below or above the peak sled deceleration of the previous test, respec- tively depending upon whether there was or was not a fatality within 3 h on the previous test. The primary advantage of this method was the concentration of testing near the tolerance level, thus increasing the accuracy of LD^q estimation (15, 16): The experiment was conducted on the Daisy Decelerator (17) utilizing a 1 135 lb (515 kg) sled. Peak sled decelerations ranged from 6.5-134 g. The impact pulse was approximately half sine (actually haversine) with the stopping distance vary- ing from 0.5-3.5 ft (0.15-1.07 m) at 6 in (15.2 cm) increments. Table 1 contains the various ranges of peak sled decelerations, velocities, pulse durations, and onsets for the test series. The instant of maximum sled deceleration occurred midway through the brake pattern. The time duration applied to the calculation of sled onset extended from the initiation of the pulse to the instant of peak deceleration. The animal preparation, instrumentation, photography, data collection, and data reduction methods have been reported previously (14, 18, 19). Although a total of 89 tests were per- formed, equipment malfunctions and preimpact cancellation of specific data channels resulted in deletions of some recorded information. Preceding all deceleration tests, the animals were anesthe- tized with sodium pentobarbital. The baboons were muzzled to mitigate lingual injury; their wrists and ankles were taped to prevent flailing (Fig. 1). Prior to impact, the head was hyper- extended approximately 15-20 deg from the neutral anatomi- Table 1 - Test Parameters Stopping Distance, ft(m) 0.5 (0.15) 1.0 (0.31) 1.5 (0.46) 2.0 (0.61) 2.5 (0.76) 3.0 (0.91) 3.5 (1.07) No. tests 12 7 6 38 6 6 14 Peak sled 21.2-134 11.3-54.7 13.0-61.2 6.5-131 11.4-59.4 8.1-62.2 9.7-112 deceleration, g Peak sled velocity, 20.5-49.1 21.4-47.4 26.9-56.2 21.8-93.2 33.5-74.2 31.9-87.0 37.3-123.5 ft/s (m/s) (6.2-15.0) (6.5-14.4) (8.2-17.1) (6.6-28.4) (10.2-22.6) (9.7-26.5) (11.4-37.6) Sled pulse 0.053-0.023 0.077-0.045 0.097-0.049 0.233-0.042 0.154-0.067 0.161-0.071 0.185-0.059 duration, s Sled onset, g/s 707-8350 264-2242 239-2155 73-5678 155-1674 92-1673 108-3961 2899</page><page sequence="3">2900 T.

The tape did not contribute significantly as a restraint since the inertia of the head easily broke the tape during the initial phase of the impact event. An extensive series of x-rays was taken immediately post- impact. Gross necropsy was conducted within 1 h postimpact for animals not surviving a deceleration test. Animals that sustained traumatic but nonlethal injuries were euthanized from 6-24 h postimpact. Many animals receiving less than 70 g (particularly at the short deceleration patterns) were not euthanized because of the absence of severe trauma. These baboons were subjected to multiple impacts at low decelera- tions. An animal was never returned to the cage in a seriously injured condition. Where fatality occurred in excess of 3 h postimpact (two tests), surgical intervention and/or fluid re- placement, if used, may have reversed the final outcome. The proportionately "scaled" Air Force restraint was com- posed of an inverted Y-yoke shoulder harness and lap belt. All restraint belts consisted of 1 in (2.54 cm) Dacron webbing of 3700 lb (16458 N) tensile test. The two torso straps were at- tached separately to the lap belt at the midline of the animal. The yoke of the torso harness was formed several inches pos- terior to the neck and continued horizontally rearward as a single belt to a triaxial load cell (Fig. 2). Each lap belt attach point was similarly instrumented with a triaxial load cell that measured forces in three axes and enabled calculation of resul- tant force magnitudes and directions. All belts were statically pretensioned at approximately 15 lb (67 N). Uniaxial accelerometers were affixed to anterior and poste- rior flanges of a lightweight plastic headmount (Fig. 1). The mount, restraining straps, and accelerometers weighed 6.7 oz (190 g). Head angular accelerations in a spatial reference sys- tem were calculated from the two linear acceleration compo- nents (20). The design of the angular acceleration system is dependent upon the principle that the tangential acceleration Fig. 1 - Baboon seated on sled before impact (run 5245) of point A on a rigid body relative to point B on the body, divided by their separation distance, is the angular acceleration of the body within a spatial reference system. Integration of head angular accelerations by computer yielded a listing and plot of angular velocity versus time. Angular displacement of the head was computed by an additional integration. All angu- lar displacements were verified by comparing the twice- integrated accelerometer values with the angular displacements obtained from high-speed movie film. The movie film also served for assessment of torso and extremity kinematics during the impact event. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TOLERANCE - The authors recognize that many physical quantities may be extracted from the exposure conditions for correlation with the limits of tolerance; for example, peak Fig. 2 - Experimental seat layout</page><page sequence="4">SHOULDER HARNESS-LAP BELT RESTRAINT 290 1 deceleration, duration of exposure, deceleration onset, mo- mentum, etc. In this report, the tolerance to impact was ex- pressed as the percentage of subjects surviving the effects of abrupt linear deceleration (~GX). Employing probit analysis (21), the median lethal sled deceleration (LD^q) was calcu- lated to be 102, 103, and 98 g for the 0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 ft (0.15, 0.61, and 1.07 m) stopping distances, respectively (Table 2). Since the deceleration pulses are similar (all half sine with different pulse duration), the results imply that im- pact lethality is dependent upon the magnitude of peak sled deceleration, irrespective of the pulse duration, sled velocity, onset, energy dissipation, or stopping distance. LD^qS were not calculated for the 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.0 ft (0.31, 0.46, 0.76, and 0.91 m) stopping distances due to limited time and resources. There was no attempt to quantitate fatalities on the Table 2 - Tolerance Limits to Impact Stopping Distance, ft(m) 0.5 (0.15) 2.0 (0.61) 3.5 (1.07) LD50, sled g 102 ± 5 103 ± 16 98 ± 3 Sled pulse duration, ms 27 46 63 Sled velocity, ft/s (m/s) 44 (13) 83 (25) 117 (36) Sled onset, g/s 5750 3962 2980 Energy dissipation ft-lb (J) 1507 (2043) 5362 (7271) 10655 (14448) basis of injury severity; that is, a fatality was a fatality irre- spective of the mode of death. Fig. 3 is a graphic representation of the tolerance limits to impact. The standard deviations are inconsistent because of the number of tests at each stopping distance (Table 1) and the statistical method of LD^q estimation. The dashed line represents the lowest sled deceleration where a fatality oc- curred; the dotted line indicates the maximum sled decelera- tion where an animal survived. The parabolic stopping dis- tance curves (Fig. 3) are not equidistant because of the mechanical properties of the decelerator and variations be- tween the anticipated and actual stopping distance of the sled (Table 3). Superficially, it would appear that these results contradict many of the significant impact manuscripts (22, 23). How- ever, it should be borne in mind that in this report, stopping distance, deceleration, velocity, pulse duration, pulse shape, and onset include only a small range of the conceivable im- pact parameters. Specifically, fatalities may occur on a cen- trifuge at less than 20 g. In this case, the duration of the ac- celeration results in cardiovascular and respiratory distress. Conversely, one can jump from a chair and receive high de- celerative force for an extremely short duration, but with no ill effect because of negligible impulse. PATHOLOGY - Although the reported injuries were pro- duced directly or indirectly by the safety restraint, its disuse would have resulted in comparable or more severe injuries at substantially lower sled decelerations (18). Fig. 3 - Tolerance levels to impact</page><page sequence="5">2902 T. D. CLARKE, ET AL. Predominant Injury Patterns - In the vicinity of 100 g, the injury patterns at the various stopping distances were appre- ciably dissimilar. At the 0.5 ft (0.15 m) stop, pelvic and ab- dominal trauma was essentially nonexistent. Most of the sig- nificant injuries were indirectly attributable to the torso portion of the restraint. These injuries included hemorrhage of thoracic musculature, myocardial contusion, and transec- tion of the cervical spinal cord resulting from avulsion of the atlanto-occipital articulation (Fig. 4). The predominant injuries at the 2.0 ft (0.61 m) stop in- cluded pelvic and abdominal myorrhexis, intestinal herniation, urinary bladder rupture, and pelvic fractures (Fig. 5). Again, the torso straps of the harness were primarily instrumental in producing the most life-threatening trauma. These injuries in- cluded costal, clavicular, and scapular fractures plus luxation of cervical through thoracic vertebrae. At the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop, the pelvic and abdominal injury patterns were similar to those at the 2.0 ft (0.61 m) stop but Table 3 - Sled Stopping Distances and Equations of G versus Velocity Anticipated Sled Actual Sled Stopping Distance, Stopping Distance, Equation of G Correlation in (cm) in (cm) versus Velocity Coefficients 6.0(15.2) 6.4(16.26) gmov = 0.0542V2 0.9991 max 12.0 (30.5) 14.5 (36.83) „ = 0.0241V2 0.9990 max „ 18.0 (45.7) 18.1 (45.97) gmax = 0.0192V2 0.9999 24.0(61.0) 24.5 (62.23) gmax = O-OMW2 0.9996 30.0(76.2) 30.1 (76.45) gm . = 0.0108V2 0.9999 max 36.0(91.4) 36.1 (91.69) gmax = 0.0082V2 0.9995 42.0(106.7) 42.3 (107.44) gmov = 0.0073V2 0.9995 max Fig. 4 - Avulsion: basilar portion of occipital bone compounded in severity (Fig. 6). There was a high incidence of transection of the descending colon and musculature or blood vessels in the axillary and cervical regions (Fig. 7). Brainstem hemorrhage was a significant finding, but there was 110 evidence of luxation or fractures of cervical vertebrae. A tabulation of impact-related trauma for all animals used in the study can be found in Table 4. Sled deceleration, velocity, onset, and pulse duration can be compared with the radiologi- cal and necropsy reports. The authors wish to emphasize equally those injuries that were nonfatal, yet incapacitating. Several points should be stressed for clarification of Table 4. First, it should be recognized that hemorrhage occurred in all myorrhexic muscle groups, lacerated, ruptured, or transected organs. Therefore, this finding is not specifically delineated within the table. Second, all injuries were bilateral unless indi- cated otherwise. The severity of injuries was not quantitated due to the complexity of arbitrary scales. Third, the baboons invariably showed evidence of parasitic infestation, particularly Fig. 5 - Abdominal evisceration. Note apparent lack of injury in midline Fig. 6 - Abdominal evisceration and myorrhexis of abdominal and pelvic musculature.

The severity of the infestation may have contributed to death in two animals that survived from 1 2- 22 h. Last, it should be noted that the cause of death is a pre- sumption based upon the necropsy findings, radiological ex- amination, and sundry clinical evaluations (blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, cerebrospinal fluid, electrocardiogram, etc.). Fatal Injuries - At all stopping distances, the primary cause of death was lower brainstem or cervical spinal cord trauma. At the 0.5 and 2.0 ft (0.15 and 0.61 m) stops, hemorrhage of the brainstem and spinal cord or transection of the cervical spinal cord typically resulted from avulsion of the atlanto- occipital articulation or luxation of cervical vertebrae. At the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop, brainstem hemorrhage concomitant with severe pelvic and abdominal trauma resulted in death. By re- viewing Table 5, one notes that avulsion of the atlanto- occipital articulation, dislocation fractures of the vertebral column, or hemorrhage of the brainstem (Fig. 8) occurred at Fig. 7 - Myorrhexis of pectoral musculature.

For the test series, this observation supports the premise that neurological trauma is related directly to maximum sled deceleration (gmax). Fur- Fig. 8 - Hemorrhage: brainstem and cerebellum thermore, since the graph of deceleration required to produce a 50% incidence of head-neck trauma (Fig. 9) is a virtual over- lay of the tolerance levels to impact (Fig. 3), the cause of death is reasonably substantiated. Lap Belt-Induced Injuries - The trauma sustained as a result of the impact can generally be attributed to either the lap belt or torso harness portion of the restraint system. Although de- tails of the gross anatomical and microscopic pathology will be reported in a subsequent paper, several of the injuries deserve additional comment. Cutaneous abrasions, contusions, and lacerations were linear in nature and resulted from impingement of the lap belt por- tion of the restraint. Hemorrhage of the inguinocrural fascia and musculature is an all-inclusive term for hemorrhage within the superficial and deep fascia of the anterolateral abdominal wall. Likewise, this terminology has been used when hemor- rhage existed within the aponeurosis of the external and inter- nal obliques, adjacent to the superior and inferior crura and from the inguinal falx to the femoral ring. Myorrhexis of the rectus abdominus, sartorius, tensor fascia lata, rectus femoris, and iliopsoas, plus comminuted fractures of the iliac crest and fossa, occurred in an area directly be- neath or adjacent to the lap belt (Fig. 10). The injuries of the pelvic and abdominal region did not result strictly as a func- tion of peak sled deceleration (Table 5). These injuries re- sulted at lower sled decelerations as the stopping distance was increased (Fig. 11).

Comminuted fractures of iliac crest and fossa rectly or indirectly from the torso portion of the restraint was generally more life-threatening than the pelvic or abdominal injuries. The high incidence of sternal, costal, clavicular, or scapular fractures presented the opportunity for pleural per- foration and thus pneumothorax. The sternal fractures may have been produced by mandibular contact with the manu- brium or body of the sternum. In six cases, the striking force was sufficient to fracture the body of the mandible (Fig. 12). Myocardial hemorrhage was invariable adjacent to the anterior interventricular artery. The injury could actually be described as contusion of the anterior wall of the right and left ventricle. It is presumed that this injury resulted from sternal and costal impingement (compression) coincident with flexion of the thorax or from cardiac displacement relative to the thoracic cage. Muscular and skeletal trauma of the axillary and cervical re- gions may be the resultant of an improper restraint for the baboon. Specifically, since the deltoid and trapezoid angles of shoulder slope in humans is an important factor in shoulder harness design (24), one would expect modifications in the existing system to reduce baboon trauma. Submarining is a phenomenon generally attributed to elonga- tion of the lap belt and torso harness webbing under applied load, causing an unbalanced turning moment on the baboon. Submarining occurred frequently in this study because the lap belt was affixed to the torso portion of the restraint. In es- Fig. 11 - Sled deceleration (gwov) required to produce 50% incidence of pelvic/abdominal trauma max</page><page sequence="17">2914 T. D. CLARKE, ET AL. sence, a vertical displacement of the lap belt was produced as the subject loaded the torso harness. Submarining was not evident at the 0.5 ft (0.15 m) stop. Moderate to severe submarining was noticed at the 2.0 ft (0.61 m) stop but only in excess of 100 g. The principal re- sulting injury was intestinal herniation. For the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop, the submarining was more severe and occurred first at about 75 g. The injuries directly attributable to sub- marining included abdominal evisceration and transection of the descending colon. Fig. 12 - Transverse fracture through body of mandible It is speculated that luxation of lumbar vertebrae also re- sulted from submarining or from rebound into the seat back. This injury was primarily associated with the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop. FORCE - Many factors relating to decelerative force are sig- nificant determinants of injury patterns. Several of these fac- tors include: force magnitude, impulse (time integral of the forces), direction of force application, site of application to the body, area of force distribution, and the mechanism through which the force is applied. In this report, only force magnitude and impulse are emphasized since the other factors remained relatively constant throughout the test series. The values of x, y, and z refer to a left-handed Cartesian co- ordinate system where x is parallel to sled movement, y is lateral, and z is vertical. The forces transmitted by the baboon to the lap belt, torso harness, seat pan, and back were recorded and corrected by subtraction of dynamic tare loads- the force/g attributable to the mass of the transducer system act- ing upon the active portion of the gage. Total lap belt force was calculated from the vector summation of the right and left belt x, y, and z force components. In Tables 6-12, peak lap belt, torso harness, seat pan, and back forces are presented in relation to maximum sled decel- eration. Equations of regression lines and respective correla- tion coefficients are given for each of the seven stopping dis- tances.

The correlation coefficients indicated a definite linear relationship between force or impulse and peak sled deceleration. In Table 13, the data from the seven stopping distances were combined to yield equations of force in relation to peak sled deceleration irrespective of the stopping distance. Although many of the correlation coefficients lost minor significance, there was no appreciable difference in the bandwidth of 90% confidence intervals. The lap belt finite forces at 0 g were par- tially due to pretensioning and to possible nonlinearity of the regression line at low sled decelerations.

D. CLARKE, ET AL. The relationship of lap belt total force to peak sled decelera- tion (Fig. 13) adheres to Newton's second law of motion. Spe- cifically, 1000 lb (4448 N) was recorded as lap belt force from only 17-22 g, irrespective of the stopping distance (Fig. 13). Indeed, at any force up to 5000 lb (22240 N), there is only a predicted variation of 20 g from the 0.5-3.5 ft (0.15-1.07 m) stop. The same relationship exists with the torso harness total force (Fig. 14), but the variability is slightly less. It is generally accepted that the ultimate harness restraint should incorporate the features of maximal area and provide equal distribution of force to the torso (25). In this test series, the lap belt received almost 54% of the total restraint load in Table 9 - Equations of Force (lb^) and Impulse (lb^-s) Regression Lines 2.0 ft (0.61 m) Stop Equation of Regression Linear Correlation Ordinate Line Coefficient Lap belt total Force = 58.6 + 41.40 (gmax) 0.9809 Impulse = 17.7+ 0.87 (gmax) 0.9783 Lap belt X Force = -40.9 + 30.77 (gmax) 0.9904 Impulse = 8.8 + 0.66 (g ) 0.9853 max7 Lap belt y Force = 62.3 + 17.27 (gmax) 0.9724 Lap belt z Force = 100.6 + 21 .50 (gmax) 0.9614 Impulse = 12.3+ 0.43 (gmax) 0.9567 Seat pan X (forward) Force = 38.6+ 4.18 (gmax&gt; 0.8816 Seat pan z (down) Force = 179.0+ 6.85 (gmax) 0.9056 Impulse = 20.9 + 0.29 (gmax) 0.8783 Seat back X (rebound) Force = 21.7+ 4.60 (g ) 0.9356 Torso harness total Force = 99 .6 + 24 .04 (gmax) 0.9908 Impulse = 16.7 + 0.52 (gmax) 0.9791 Torso harness X Force = 97.4 + 24.01 (g v) 0.9909 max Torso harness z Force = -5.7+ 1.92 (g Ì 0.8804 max Table 10 - Equations of Force (lb^) and Impulse (lb^-s) Regression Lines 2.5 ft (0.76 m) Stop Equation of Regression Linear Correlation Ordinate Line Coefficient Lap belt total Force = -56.4 + 51.19 (g ) 0.9864 max Impulse = 9.8+ 1.53 (gmax) 0.9672 Lap belt x Force = -83.2 + 37.57 (gmax) 0.9770 Impulse = 4.8+ L12(gmax) 0.9659 Lap belt y Force = -4.3 + 23.06 (g^ov) 0.9896 max Lap belt z Force = 7.2 + 26.02 (gmax) 0.9942 Impulse = 7.0+ 0.77 (gm,v) max 0.9605 max Seat pan x (forward) Force = 50.5 + 4.43 (gmax) 0.8715 Seat pan z (down) Force = 160.0 + 13.37 (gwov) 0.9126 max Impulse = 8.9 + 0.65 (gmax) 0.9109 Seat back x (rebound) Force = 0.4 + 2.85 (gmax) 0.8850 Torso harness total Force = -53.1 + 29.31 (g ) 0.9955 max Impulse = 5.9 + 0.88 (gmax) 0.9840 Torso harness x Force = -53.7 + 29.30 (gmax) 0.9956 Torso harness z Force = 20.6 + 0.40 (g ) 0.2372 max</page><page sequence="20">SHOULDER HARNESS-LAP BELT RESTRAINT 29 1 7 the X direction at any of the stopping distances. However, ap- proximately 62% of the restraint total force (vector summa- tion of X, y, and z components) was transmitted to the lap belt portion of the restraint. Although there is a relatively equal distribution of force with this restraint system, these figures should be used cau- tiously. The force measurements may be somewhat redundant because the torso portion of the restraint is affixed to the lap belt. Likewise, there exists a force amplification of at least 16% within the restraint system.

The magnitude of impulse is virtually unaffected by the level of peak sled deceleration. That is, the same impulse at the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop occurs at the 0.5 ft (0.15 m) stop at considerably higher peak sled deceleration and shorter pulse duration. A significant finding is that the 50% incidence of pelvic and abdominal trauma (Fig. 11) has almost the same re- lationship (in slope) to sled deceleration and velocity as does impulse (Fig. 15). Therefore, it is not peak restraining force but the level of impulse that appears to be a significant deter- minant of muscular and skeletal trauma of the pelvic and ab- dominal region. Also, many of the thoracic injuries may be produced via the same mechanism.

Head angular acceleration, velocity, and displacement of baboons restrained with the Air Force shoul- der harness-lap belt are graphically displayed for a 0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 ft (0.15, 0.61, and 1.07 m) stop at 1 13.6, 105.1, and 90.4 g, respectively (Figs. 17-19). The primary positive and negative peaks of the head angular acceleration traces occurred at approximately the same time, even though the durations of the impact pulses were quite dif- ferent. Peak head angular velocities and displacements did oc- cur earlier in time for the tests with the greatest stopping dis- tance and therefore the greatest sled velocity. The average peak magnitudes for angular accelerations and velocities were approximately equal at the various stopping dis- tances (Table 14). The head angular displacements were considerably less for the 3.5 ft (1.07 m) stop (averaging 64 deg) because of submarining and the forward translation of the thorax preventing full head-neck rotation. Indeed, in all cases at the different stopping distances, the maximum head-neck flexion was determined by mandibular contact with the sternum. Although in a previous report there was a linear relationship between head angular acceleration and maximum sled decelera- tion (14), the relatively few tests at the 0.5 and 3.5 ft (0.15 and 1.07 m) stopping distances precluded this type of analysis in this report. It appears that the magnitude of head angular acceleration is related to peak sled deceleration, but the au- thors did not attempt to correlate lethal head-neck trauma with head angular accelerations. Linear accelerations of the head were not recorded in the x and y directions. Therefore, it is only speculative to assume that lethal trauma may have re- sulted from translational or angular shear loading at the atlanto-occipital articulation. SUMMARY LD^qS were calculated to be 102, 103, and 98 g for the 0.5, 2.0, and 3.5 ft stopping distances, respectively. Since the de- celeration pulses were similar (all half sine with different pulse duration), the results imply that for the pulse range investi- gated, impact lethality is dependent upon the magnitude of peak sled deceleration irrespective of the pulse duration, sled velocity, onset, energy dissipation, or stopping distance. At all stopping distances, the primary cause of death was lower brainstem or cervical spinal cord trauma. At the 0.5 and 2.0 ft stops, hemorrhage of the brainstem and spinal cord or transection of the cervical spinal cord typically resulted from avulsion of the atlanto-occipital articulation or luxation of cer- vical vertebrae. At the 3.5 ft stop, brainstem hemorrhage con- comitant with severe pelvic and abdominal trauma resulted in death. The peak sled deceleration required to produce a 50% inci- dence of injuries at various stopping distances provided a con- venient method of presenting and discussing injury causation. The level of impulse or the time integral of restraint force ap- peared to be a significant factor contributing to muscular and skeletal trauma of the pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic regions. Additional investigations of injury patterns should improve the understanding of impact trauma causation and provide further guidance for designers of occupant restraint systems.
