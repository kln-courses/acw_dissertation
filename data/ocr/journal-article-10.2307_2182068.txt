<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS THE IDEA OF CHRIST IN THE GOSPELS, OR GOD IN MAN. A Critical Essay. By GEORGE SANTAYANA. New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, I946. Pp, Vi, 266. Mr. Santayana's aim here is, first, to describe fully and sympathetically the idea of Christ presented in the Gospels. The most profound of the elements in this idea is, he finds, the notion of God in man; and his second aim is to restate in philosophical language whatever is true in this notion. "For in my opinion," he writes, "this mystery is entirely natural; by no means the invention of a wild theosophy but only a poetic expression of the dawn of spirit in every reflective mind." In pursuit of this second aim Mr. Santayana develops the atmosphere of "monarchical theism" in which the figure of Christ moves. He also ex- amines the notion of creation, finding that it presupposes monarchical theism and is therefore, like the latter, an anthropomorphic idea and metaphorical. (In the course of this discussion he answers the problem of free will in this wise: "Moral freedom . .. does not lie in an alleged magic power to produce events contrary to the course of nature; it lies only in the physically undiscoverable love of the spirit for that which it truly loves.") He also examines the idea of the fatherhood of God. Though vividly convinced of the precariousness of the human situation, and there- fore compelled to deny fatherhood- in the sense of a God who protects and indulges us, he yet discovers in this notion "spirit recognising its true rela- tion to the universe which gave it birth." Mr. Santayana also discusses "moralism," that is, "the effort to moral- ise God or nature, and to see in God or nature the model 'for human vir- tue." He holds that Christ in the Gospels is not in the least moralistic, that moralism is false (God perfectly realizes His own nature and standard but He does not seem to be prevailingly kind and charitable), and that the denial of moralism in no- way undermines human morality, while the assertion of moralism "ends by justifying all evils." Mr. Santayana offers to show us moralism leading to this result in the thoughts of Spinoza and of Marcus Aurelius. The idea of Christ, he concludes, is a model by which the philosopher may escape "the snare of moralism, that destroys the sweetness of human affections by stretching them on the rack of infinity and absoluteness." He also discusses God's love of man and man's love of God. God's love of man is not the artist's love of self-expression "but rather love of something missed, of something defeated and unexpressed, to which this erring world was inwardly addressed, and for the lack of which it horribly and perpetually suffered." As to man's love of God, there is . . . one strain in human nature that craves union with God at God's level. It may be called reason, but it does not proceed by reasoning. It may be I07</page><page sequence="2">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW called love, but it claims possession of nothing. It is that free life of the spirit which continually peeps out in intelligence and in laughter, only to be smothered again in the press of affairs. This is the element in us that we have distinguished and hypostasised in the idea of pure spirit. In his three last chapters he comes to his philosophical restatement of the idea of God in man. "A striking analogy subsists between [the] union of the rational with the animal nature in man and the union of the divine with the human nature in the idea of Christ. Can this analogy be acci- dental?" "The goal of that aspiration which makes an unnecessary loop through the supernatural" is the ideal. "When we place the good directly in the ideal we are for the first time completely freed from the predica- ments of existence." "The supernatural is the ideal hypostasised. But if you hypostasise the ideal you kill it." What the doctrine of a supernatural soul'really means is the "inalienable vocation of the spirit to detach itself from the flesh and the world." Essential to all intelligence is self-trans- cendence, "or spontaneous intent fixed upon an unseen object." "The enigmatic presence of God in man signifies the same thing as holiness, or the complete triumph of spirit over the other elements of human nature." "The idea of Christ thus represents the intrinsic ideal of spirit; that is to say, the acme of disinterested intelligence and disinterested love." This reduction of the God-man to the terms of Mr. Santayana's Realm of Spirit is not the most interesting part of the present book. Mr. Santa- yana's doctrine of spirit suffers by the comparison. It appears somewhat thin, static, obscure, and perhaps not much freer from myth than the myth it would replace. In the notion of spirit, Mr. Santayana's reluctance to define which has been pointed out by Professor Schilpp, we seem to have a case of using a word in two senses so related that if the first refers to all the A's, the second refers only to such A's as are good, and the two are conflated. When he must indicate what he means by "spirit," Mr. San- tayana gives it a purely descriptive sense that covers both good and bad in man's life; thereafter he uses the word as if it meant something essen- tially good. This way of using words-and the reluctance to define them that goes with it-is probably a fruitful field for semantic study. So is also the whole modern use of the words "spirit" and "spiritual." More charming and rewarding is the earlier and larger part of the book, where Mr. Santayana enters into and describes the Gospel picture of Christ, under the heads of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Son of Man, the miracles, the parables, the prophecies and the precepts, the prayers, the passion, and the resurrection. In the miracle at the marriage at Cana "the occasion is trivial, even comic: the host has underestimated the drinking power of his guests." What have I to do with thee? seems a rude reply of Jesus to his mother. "But if we revise the translation and read: What is that to me and to thee? io8</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS OF BOOKS the words mark a reversion in Christ, in the midst of a crowded feast, to the sense of his incomparable origin and dignity." "He was consenting to a small kindness, when the premonition of torment and of glory filled his whole sky." That is a sample of what readers may find in these pages; and many a reader will be intrigued by Mr. Santayana's new translation. However, the Greek, -rl 4tol Kal ofOl;, is, according tothe commentators a translation of a Hebrew phrase that occurs several times in the Old Testament and never means anything near Mr. Santayana's interpreta- tion. The Gospels are works of inspiration according to Mr. Santayana, and his first chapter develops the idea of inspiration along the lines of his earlier writing. In method of composition they are religious epics. "Their criterion of truth is not evidence or probability; it is congruity with the faith, fittingness, significance, edification." Inspiration is primitive and pervasive, springing from an innate poetic fertility in the psyche. Its deliverances may or may not be historically true. Whether they are in this case Mr. Santayana declines to investigate. "I wish only to analyse and detach, as far as possible, one original element in the inspiration of the Gospels, namely, the drramatic presentation of the person of Christ." As the work proceeds, however, every reader will have the feeling that Mr. Santayana does not merely analyze. He is also himself inspired to add to and develop the Gospel picture in his own way. How could he help it, being a poet and a special, lover of this particular myth? In fine, Santayana the poet-critic of the Gospel story is charming and inspiring; Santayana the metaphysician of the mystery of God in man is obscure and dull. The book abounds with fine phrases: "For the most part . . . the universe rolls on in a peace it does not enjoy towards catas- trophes it does not expect." Throughout it we can feel and delight in the mind of a sage and poet whose prevailing moods are melancholy, skepti- cism, and sweetness. RICHARD ROBINSON Oriel College, Oxford</page></plain_text>
