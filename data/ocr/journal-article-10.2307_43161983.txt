What kinds of things do you do when you have a great amount of energy? What do plants do with their energy? How can you save some energy to use later? These are just a few of the questions surrounding a collection of gadgets, demonstrations, and toys that are the basis of a 45-minute program about energy offered to school groups visiting the Museum of Science in Boston. Get-Up-and-Go is presented to groups of up to 35 students from grades one through four in a small classroom away from the bustle of the Museum's ex- hibit halls. Get-Up-and-Go combines the elements of a child's in- tuitive understanding of his or her own energy with demonstrations of a collection of mechanical gadgets, to produce an awareness of energy at work around us all the time. Recognition of energy transfers and transfor- mations, awareness of energy storage, and a method of tracing an energetic action backwards to its source are part of the session. Although the program is presented to elementary students, the gadgets and techniques could be applied to a much wider range of learning levels, including junior high and high school, and even at the college level in teacher training courses. A description of the program and some thoughts on how to take it into your classroom follow: When the students enter our classroom, a small Hero's Engine is steaming and spinning on the table before them. 4 'Sterno" or "canned heat" is the heat source. As the water inside the engine boils, steam is LAWRENCE BELL and DOROTHY M. CONNELLY Education Associates Museum of Science Boston, Massachusetts produced and issues from three jets arranged in pin- wheel fashion on the sphere. (Hero was a scientist who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and described this first- known steam engine in 120 B.C.) The Museum's engine is made from a copper toilet tank float suspended on a bearing, allowing it to rotate around a vertical axis. Small bent pieces of copper tubing soldered into holes on the equator of the float form the steam jets. If you make a Hero's engine be careful not to let it rotate too fast, lest boiling water sprays out of the jets. The Hero's Engine is an immediate attention-getter and conversation-starter. We use it to introduce studies of mechanical devices. "Can anyone figure out what is going on here? What is inside this thing? Can you think of anything else that spins when 'stuff' squirts out of it?" The familiar reaction of an inflated balloon when released helps to establish the reality of the jet propul- sion that makes the engine spin. The next gadget we look at is Max the Mechanical Muscle Man. Max is an anthropomorphic, pressure- driven waterwheel, whose sole function is to lift weights for the entertainment of Museum visitors. Max obtains his energy from "eating" baking soda and vinegar, which releases carbon dioxide, providing the pressure to squirt water at a paddle wheel attached to his arms. Strings tied to the arms wind up and lift the weights from the floor. We use Max to link humans and machines, and to in- troduce an analysis of an energy system. Where does the energy come from? What does it do? What changes take place along the way? We focus attention next on a bean bag set on the floor. Does this thing have any energy? What kinds of behavior do we associate with things that are energetic? If we hoist the bean bag to the ceiling with a rope and pulley, does it have any more energy then? If the kids are not sure because it is hanging motionless, all the teacher has to do is step directly under the hanging bean bag and everyone can recognize its potential. When this stored energy is released by dropping the bean bag on a lever device that pushes a toy truck, the energy is 36 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="2">Hero's engine. converted into a form with a more recognizably energetic behavior. Next, one of the students holds an electrified photographic floodlight above a toy car equipped with solar cells for power. The light activates the cells and the car moves. This toy introduces some speculation about solar cars and solar power. How could you go anywhere at night? Could you use stored energy? How could you store electric energy? What else is all around us and runs on sunlight energy? How do plants use energy? What happens to the energy in fruits and vegetables? We examine stored energy in spring toys. Viewing their inside workings provides another opportunity for recognizing mechanical energy. Figuring out how something operates is a direct step in solving some of our energy problems. After the demonstration, the classes go out into the Museum's exhibit halls to explore the exhibits about energy, and to look for energy at work around them, with their heightened awareness. Although the devices used in Get-Up-and-Go were specially designed for our Museum's program, the basic lessons and techniques can be replicated in any school. All types of toys and gadgets around home and school use, store, and transform energy. Here are some suggestions: • Stand dominoes in a line, then push the first one over. • Line up marbles touching one another in the groove between two meter sticks. Roll another marble to strike the line and see what happens. • Use a mousetrap, a rubber-band-powered airplane, a flying saucer shooter, and other wind-up toys. Notice how they work. • Mix baking soda and vinegar in a liquid detergent bottle to pop a cork, inflate a balloon, and squirt gas to turn a pin wheel. • Build a Tinkertoy structure or use hardware-store pulleys to make a weight pull a toy car. • Make a nutcracker with a hanging weight and a pulley. Rather than ask specific questions about each activi- ty, general questions asked at the right moments will help direct students' investigations and aid their understanding: What kinds of energy are involved? PHOTOS BY MUSEUM OF SCIENCE Max, the Mechanical Muscle Man. Where does the energy come from? What happens to it (transferred from one object to another, transformed to another kind, etc.)? Exploring the energy of familiar objects can help students carry over into their everyday experiences an awareness of energy and how it can be transferred, transformed, and stored. We suggest the following to start children thinking about the energy in their lives: • Trace the energy flow in toys and everyday devices; identify the different forms of energy and trace them back as far as you can. • As a class, list methods of storing energy. Where are these methods used? What kinds of energy do they store? How do they receive the energy? • Brainstorm together to list all the energy used by one person in a day. In what form is the energy and where does it come from? • Have the children draw "Rube Goldberg" devices, in which energy is transferred from object to object and transformed from form to form to create a chain of events.1 Activities and discussions concerning energy in every- day life will raise questions about the world energy situation and can motivate student research. Some such questions are: • How limited is the supply of fossil fuels? • What are advantages and disadvantages of using solar, wind, and geothermal genergy? Which ways of using these sources are most practical? • What are advantages and disadvantages of using nuclear energy to produce electric energy for people? • If you trace energy systems back far enough, you will find you always end up with the sun or nuclear energy on Earth. Find out more about nuclear energy. How does the sun produce energy? The demonstrations and activities of Get-Up-and-Go2 begin with a child's intuitive feeling for energy to develop an understanding of energy systems he or she experiences. These experiences are a basis upon which to build an awareness of the world's energy-related prob- lems and a start toward thinking about solutions. 1 See "Creativity Is a Bunch of Junk," by Alan McCormack.
