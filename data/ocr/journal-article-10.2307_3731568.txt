I From the battlement I will go down, forbear to sing in dawn-song melody. Those who love one another in secret, if they wish to confer merit upon their love, let them think hard upon the instruction of him to whom their lives and honour are committed. If a man were to request it of me, truly I would give him good advice and offer help. Knight, awake, be on your guard. II I have no wish to injure the reputation all watchmen have for loyalty to a man of worth. You should not think, lady, of the pain of parting, given the hope of a future meeting. It would be unseemly if upon those who practise love lay the burden of giving warning. With the coming of summer my mouth sings: 'Through the clouds the gleam of dawn is pressing. Awake, be on your guard, sweet stranger!' III He had no choice but to leave, he who was unwilling to hear her lament. Then his mouth spoke: 'Never was any man's discovery of happiness so totally destroyed by sorrow.' Undaunted, he pursued the chase in such a way that sorrow fled them. Intimate motions, most secret embraces, pressing her little breasts - and other things beside - gave them a leave-taking worthy of high praise. 'Ein Wichter, der die programmatische Erklarung, seinen Sang nun einstellen zu wollen, verbindet mit dem Vortrag eines zweistrophigen Liedes, verliert an Glaub- wiirdigkeit' (Wapnewski, p. 127). Thus Peter Wapnewski addresses the central problem of interpretation posed by Wolfram von Eschenbach's dawn-song 'Von der zinnen' (Lachmann 6, Io; MFv). Since his definitive study of Wolfram von Eschenbach's lyric poetry, most critics have followed the example of the watchman and forborn to sing on this particular melody. The attitude of the watchman in the first strophe is puzzling, to say the least. He apparently at first desires to cease singing, but then goes back on his word. Wapnewski considers what would be the more natural translation of the opening lines, 'Meinen Wachtergesang in der Melodie des Tagesanbruchs will ich jetzt einstellen', but rejects this as nonsensical. Following Karl Heinz Borck in his unpublished dissertation, he prefers the rather forced reading, "'Meinen Wachter- gesang will ich jetzt einstellen mit [in] einer Tagesmelodie", d.h. "indem ich eine 1 The line-division is that of Karl Lachmann, Wolfram von Eschenbach (Berlin, 1833), subsequently adopted by Peter Wapnewski, Die Lyrik Wolframs von Eschenbach (Munich, 1972), and H. Moser and H. Tervooren, Des Minnesangs Frihling, 36th edition (Stuttgart, 1977). The apparatus updates the fuller list of variants supplied by Wapnewski (pp. I 6-2I), but limits itself to those emendations which are extraneous to both manuscripts. The translation has no pretensions other than to accuracy. More polished renderings are offered by Arthur T. Hatto, Eos: An Enquiry into the Theme of Lovers' Meetings and Partings at Dawn in Poetry (The Hague, I965), p. 454, and Wapnewski, pp. I40-41.</page><page sequence="3">360 Wolfram's Peevish Watchman Tagesmelodie singe"': in tagewise is thus seen as 'Apposition'.2 Moser and Ter- vooren incorporate this interpretation in the new edition of Des Minnesangs Fruhling: 'mit einer Tagesmelodie den Gesang einstellen' (I, 443), and it is also accepted by Helmut Brackert, in his recent anthology: 'mit diesem Tagelied meinen Sang lassen.'3 The more natural translation is espoused by Arthur Hatto: 'I shall go down from the battlement without singing my song of dawning', and Olive Sayce: 'omit to sing a dawn-song'.4 That this is how the line was initially understood by the scribe of the Manesse manuscript (C) is clear from the fact that he at first wrote ein tagewizse sanc verbern, and then in recognition of his error indicated suppression of the e of ein by a sublinear dot; tagewi'sesanc may have been appreciated by the scribe of C as a characteristically Wolframian compound. Wapnewski's translation implies that the watchman has hitherto been indulging in a 'Wachtergesang' consisting of songs other than dawn-songs, and only now elects to conclude his serenade with a presumably rather hoarse-voiced alba. There is no evidence for other musical activities on the part of the watchman in the surviving corpus of early MHG lyric, nor indeed is the genre of the serenade attested in this corpus, except obliquely in Kiirenberg's strophe: Ich stuont mir nehtint spate an einer zinne, do hort ich einen riter vil wol singen in Kurenberges wise al uz der menigin. er muoz mir diu lant rumen alder ich geniete mich sin. (MF8, i) Taken with this perhaps excessive burden of logic, Wapnewski's reading seems suspect. But if we revert to the pre-Wapnewski translation, and have a watchman who does not sing at all, we are left with the problem of how to explain the fact that the wahter, at the latest by the end of the second strophe, does apparently sing his song. (The extent of this song within a song is itself open to interpretation. Wapnewski places the words 'durch wolken dringet | ein tagender glast' in quotation marks. Most editors opt for a policy of non-commitment here, but there is certainly a case to be made for the song within a song to include the last line of the second strophe, which gives expression to the most essential function of the watchman's song: 'hfiete din, wache, suezer gast!'.) PeterJohnson, aware of the contradiction, tentatively suggests that the watchman withholds 'his public dawnsong, presumably to allow the lover to escape', and that the song he then proceeds to sing is intended solely for the lovers rather than as a 'rousing carol to all and sundry'.5 This ingenious distinction is the natural consequence ofJohnson's meticulous attempt to locate the watchman in the socio-historic reality of the thirteenth-century castle, but it cannot be said to emerge clearly from the watchman's statements in 'Von der zinnen'. Johnson, like Jonathan Saville,6 is concerned with the problem of the fictionality of the watchman figure. Saville distinguishes between the military and peace-time functions of the watchman.

Artus mit sin gesellen lac Unz nahe zuo der none, Do was ime vil schone Der imbiz bereit Nach des hoves gewonheit.7 The watchman in the alba, in contrast to his more 'realistic' counterpart, is concerned to waken only the two lovers, not the whole court. If this fiction is subjected to the socio-historic approach, then both the watchman's precise location in the castle and the volume with which he issues his warning become problematic. Saville takes the easier path out of this labyrinth by reminding us 'that the watchman's role is not realistic but symbolic', while at the same time 'the symbolic meanings the alba watchman carries with him are related to the functions of "realistic" literary watchmen, those whose job is not to warn lovers but to take part in the social and military life of a town' (p. I 43).Johnson, arguing from the intimacy between knight-lover and watchman in Wolfram's dawn-songs, sees Wolfram's watchman as an upwardly mobile figure: 'a man at arms assisting a companion and fellow soldier in a risky, but essentially blameless love-affair' (Johnson, pp. 331-32). Johnson also seeks a 'realistic' solution to the problem of location: 'Such private bedchambers as existed in medieval castles were often situated in turrets and towers, so perhaps the lovers and the wahtaer were not as remote as we might imagine' (p. 3 I4). The image of cosy intimacy painted by Johnson would have been greatly facilitated by the invention of the chimney, and it is perhaps no coincidence that late-medieval dawn-songs tend to have a greater wealth of locational detail: Er nam sie bey der hende, beyjr schneeweissen hand, er fiiret sie an ein ende, uber ein schmalen gang, wol in ein kimmerlein finster, da lag der held und schlieff, der wechter an der zinnen, o sch6nes mein lieb, den hellen tag anblies.8 Whether the watchman is a guard or time-keeper in the employ of society, or the accomplice of the knight-lover, his place is on high; zinne and, less commonly, turn are, as Saville's, Hatto's, and Scheunemann's examples show, the recurrent archi- tectural features associated with him: ufiegelicheme turn ein wahtaere ... darufe si tac unde naht lagen, der biirge si schone pflagen, 7 Heinrich von dem Tiirlin, Diu Cr6ne, edited by Gottlob H.

Qu'ieu vey l'alba e. ljorn clar.' Gaite de la tor, Gardez entor Les murs, se Deus vos voie!10 It seems probable that this was, initially, a polygenetic reflection of medieval reality, rather than the consequence of direct influence of Romance on German texts. The Deutsches Wbrterbuch goes so far as to make the association of watchman and tower part of its definition: '2 ... a) mhd. wahtaere ist namentlich der burgwachter, der von der zinne oder dem thurm der ritterburg aus ausschau halt und das nahen von feinden meldet.'"l It cannot have been long, however, before the watchman in his tower became a literary topos. The watchman in 'Von der zinnen' is therefore peculiar in two ways: not only does he wish to forbear from singing but he also wishes to come down from his tower. None of the anthologized examples offers a parallel to this. It seems probable that an audience conversant with the characteristics of the genre would hear in the very first line of the song the signal that the watchman wished to abandon his task. His descent from the watchtower and his forbearing to sing the alba are synchronous expressions of a renunciation of his function. We are left with the problem of motive. Why should the watchman wish to betray the trust placed in him? Both Hatto and Wapnewski choose to alter the sequence of Wolfram's dawn-songs as it appears in the manuscripts. It seems reasonable to ask if 9 Der Munchener Oswald, edited by Georg Baesecke, Germanistisehe Abhandlungen, 28 (Breslau, 1907), 11. 1643-45; Herbort's von Fritslar Liet von Troye, edited by Ge. K.

Both the Weingarten manuscript (B) and the Manesse Codex (C) place 'Von der zinnen' directly after 'Der helden minne ir klage', which in turn is preceded by 'Ein wib mac wol erlouben mir'. This is the sum of B's knowledge of Wolfram, whereas C follows with 'Ursprinc bluomen', 'Ez ist nu tac' (also in A), 'Guot wib ich bite dich minne', and 'Maniger klaget die schoene zit', drawn from source(s) additional to the hypothetical archetype *BC. (The Munich Parzival manuscript G, sole source of'Den morgenblich bi wahtaeres sange erchos' and 'Sin chlawen', stands apart from the main pattern of Minnesang transmission, and contains neither 'Von der zinnen' nor 'Der helden minne'.) The earliest editor, Lachmann, retains the sequence suggested by the manuscripts. Kraus follows Lachmann, as does Leitzmann.12 Hatto and Wapnewski invert the sequence, so that the anti-dawn-song, 'Der helden minne', appears as the last of the songs relating to the alba. Moser and Tervooren revert to the Lachmann sequence. The relationship between composition, performance, initial writing down, and the necessarily arbitrary ultimate transmission of medieval German songs is a matter of conjecture, but it is at least conceivable that the transmission reflects an intention on the part of the poet-performer for priority of 'Der helden minne' over 'Von der zinnen'. 13 In both songs, as Wapnewski recognizes, there is a problematizing of the watchman's role, which is referred to as long-established: du sunge ie gen dem tage ('Der helden minne', L. 5, 35) Ein sumer bringet, daz mln munt singet. .. ('Von der zinnen', L. 6, 36) But the finality of the rejection of the alba situation, of a clandestine and dangerous love-relationship, and therewith of the raison d'etre of the watchman figure is far greater in 'Der helden minne' than in 'Von der zinnen'. In the first strophe the poet is apostrophized and told to suppress his song: swaz di d6 riete in beiden, do uf gienc Der morgensterne, wahtaere, swic, da von niht ... sinc.

The few who have addressed themselves to this problem have on the whole come to negative conclusions. Compare Eduard Hans Kohnle, Studien zu den Ordnungsgrundsiitzen mittelhochdeutscher Liederhandschriften, Tiibinger germanistische Arbeiten, 20 (Stuttgart, 1934), Hermann Schneider, 'Eine mhd. Liedersammlung als Kunstwerk', PBB, 47 (1923), 225-60, Carl Biitzler, 'Die Strophenordnung in mittelhochdeutschen Liederhandschriften', ZfdA, 77 (1940), I43-74, Anselmus Hendrikus Touber, 'Formale Ordnungsprinzipien in mittelhochdeutschen Liederhandschriften', ZfdA, 95 (1966), 187-203, and my own 'Kodikologie und Chronologie: Zu den "letzten Liedern" Walthers von der Vogelweide', in Deutsche Handschriften 11oo-400o, edited by Volker Honemann and Nigel Palmer (Tiibingen, i988), pp. 297-315. Touber concludes, with commendable caution, that a chronological sequence may be identifiable 'in spiirlichen Relikten' (p. 203). I am indebted to my colleague Peter Christian for discussion on this point.</page><page sequence="7">364 Wolfram's Peevish Watchman The alba, and the form of love it represents, are rejected by Wolfram in favour of a kind of love that is without risk because it has no need for secrecy, one of the definitive characteristics of courtly love: Ein offeniu siieze wirtes wip kan solhe minne geben. (L.6,9) It is this revolutionary attitude to courtly love that led Hatto and Wapnewski to place the anti-dawn-song 'Der helden minne' last in their editions of Wolfram's dawn-songs. However, the curious behaviour of the watchman in 'Von der zinnen' is readily explicable if it is taken as a reaction, a riposte to the rebuff he received at the hands of Wolfram's poetic persona in 'Der helden minne'. Thus, in the first strophe of'Von der zinnen', the watchman is reacting to the apostrophe directed towards him in 'Der helden minne', the command that he should be silent, and he peevishly declines to sing, threatening to leave his position in the tower. Sulking, he reminds his listeners of the great responsibility borne by the watchman and the valuable service he can render, preserving their lives and reputations. Who are his listeners? Peter Johnson suggests that 'the wahtaer's address to both knight and lady may be merely in his mind' (Johnson, p. 312). The strophe makes more sense if we imagine the watchman to be grumbling within earshot of the lovers. He goes on to say that he will proffer his invaluable advice only if he in turn is treated well and approached in the correct manner: 'Der mich des baete'. In the last line of the first strophe, the watchman thinks better of his previous unwillingness to perform his task, and issues the warning 'ritter, wache, hiiete din!'. From its varied repetition in strophe n, reminiscent of the refrain which is a recurrent stylistic trait in the German alba, this may be taken to be part or all of his song. In the second strophe, the watchman explains why he has, after all, fulfilled his role. The first consideration that motivated his volte-face was the moral obligation upon him and all watchmen, summed up by the key word triuwe. The second Stollen addresses the lady directly. It appears as if a silent appeal has been made to the watchman by the female of the two lovers, perhaps in response to 'der mich des baete'. In the Abgesang, the watchman reverts to theorizing: the interests of (dawn-song) love demand that lovers be free of care and should not have the burden of possible discovery weighing upon them. The watchman's function is finally seen to be as inevitable as the ebb and flow of the seasons. B's reading 'swaz mmn munt singet' should not be rejected out of hand: no matter how faithfully the watchman fulfils his function, dawn will come - and in summer, the time of love, its arrival is so much the earlier. Finally, the watchman turns again to the knight, and in the variation on the last line of strophe i, his tone is noticeably more friendly: 'hiiete din, wache, sfiezer gast.' In the third strophe, the watchman disappears, having no part to play in the erotic climax. The knight speaks for the first time, expressing his sorrow at the parting, and then, as in 'Sine klawen' and 'Den morgenblic', dialogue yields to third-person narrative. In his concluding chapter, 'Der Wachter und das Tagelied', Wapnewski asserts: 'Das vorliegende Material erlaubt keinen anderen SchluB als den, daB Wolfram der Erste war, der im deutschen Tagelied den Wachter aufstellte.' There follows perforce the corollary: 'Wolfram hat mit der Einfuihrung der Wichterfigur zugleich</page><page sequence="8">CYRIL EDWARDS 365 eine gewisse ihr anhaftende Problematik erfaBt und sie demzufolge in verschiedenen Varianten durchgespielt' (Wapnewski, p. 246). Wapnewski here chooses to ignore two admittedly highly problematic pieces of evidence, which suggest that the figure of the watchman may have not been unknown in the pre-Wolframian alba. The line in Dietmar's dawn-song, 'wan wecket uns leider schiere' (MF 39, 19), is open to the interpretation that some human agency is involved in the waking of the lovers, particularly if one accepts Kraus's emendation of wan to man. This is at least as likely as the hypothesis that the line is an anthropomorphic reference to the vogell'n of the following line. Secondly, the palaeographic evidence alone is strong enough to suggest that Carmina Burana I83a, 'Ich sich den morgen sterne brehen', cannot be much later in date than the first quarter of the thirteenth century. Here, too, the suggestion of a watchman is tantalizingly oblique: swer tovgenlichen minnet, wie tugentlich daz stet, da frivnschaft hute hat.14 It is arguable that Wolfram's ironization of the watchman figure, and his references to the watchman's traditional role, would be more readily comprehensible to the audience if the gaita figure were familiar to them from songs other than 'Sine klawen' and 'Den morgenblic bi wahtaers sanc erk6s'. The vacuum in manuscript trans- mission need not correspond to a vacuum in the audience's knowledge of the convention on which Wolfram launches his vehement attack. The major flaw in Wapnewski's study is its attempt to impose upon such a slender corpus of lyrics a socio-historical hypothesis. This leads him to a somewhat unconvincing summary of the content of 'Von der zinnen' as 'Voraussetzung und Begriindung einer "Absage" durch Darlegung der Unwiirdigkeit des Abhingig- keitsverhiltnisses Herr: Diener' (Wapnewski, p. 251). More polemically, he would hear in this '"Tagelied des Wachters", in dem SelbstbewuBtsein der Person und ihres Amtes schon etwas... von den groBen sozialen Umbruchen, die das Hohe Mittelalter bald beenden, den Ritter abwerten und entwiirdigen, den kleinen Mann sich seiner selbst entsinnen lassen werden' (Wapnewski, p. I30). Wapnewski sees Wolfram as a man of nascent democratic opinions, who finds himself increasingly at odds with the aristocratic genre of the alba. This tendency to succumb to the 'biographical fallacy', which Christopher Wells noted in his review,15 is com- pounded by a leaning towards the 'intentionalist fallacy', when Wapnewski suggests a sequence or cycle for the dawn-songs which places 'Von der zinnen' in penultimate position and 'Der helden minne' last. Wapnewski does not commit himself to an explanation of whether his sequence is chronological in terms of the poet's creativity - a reconstruction which Joachim Bumke considers impossible - or whether it constitutes a 'Vortragsfolge'.16 Where Bumke's negativism perhaps goes too far is in denying altogether the possibility of the reconstruction of the sequence of songs in a performance, which may in turn reflect an association or sequence of thought intended by the poet. Here the sequence of songs in a manuscript may, on occasion, be an invaluable guide. 14 Hatto, p. 446 (no. 2). Hatto goes so far as to suggest 'that the words are uttered by a watchman'. 15 ChristopherJ. Wells, 'What of the Dawn?', TLS, 27 October 1972, p. 1296. 16Joachim Bumke, Die Wolfram von Eschenbach Forschung seit i945 (Munich, I970), p. 346 (quoted by Wapnewski, p. 256). Wapnewski gives a useful synopsis of previous attempts at ordering the songs (p. 26I).</page><page sequence="9">366 Wolfram's Peevish Watchman If an explanation is required for the fascination which the figure of the watchman evidently exerted upon Wolfram, then it is not necessary to look further than the inclination observed in his epic works to invest even the least significant of his characters with individuality, drawing upon his capacity for projecting himself into the thought patterns of his fictional creations. The eternal appeal of the dawn-song lies in its compressed fusion of the happiness and sorrow of the human erotic experience. Wolfram's essays in this genre are based in his awareness of this duality. To impose upon them the constraints of a hypothetical sequence, whether of a biographical or any other nature, is to run the risk of ignoring the dynamic of the individual song and so belittling Wolfram's genius. But it would be wrong to ignore the possibility that the sequence in which the songs is transmitted may serve as a guide to interpretation.
