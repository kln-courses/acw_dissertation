In the most recent publication of the Department of Applied Statistics at University College, Mendel ism and the Problem of Mental Defect,1 Professor Karl Pearson presents himself as a censor scientiarum, with many warnings against "appearances of knowledge where we are as yet in a state of ignorance," against "quackery in science," against " ignorance and dogma parading before the public as knowledge," and so forth and so on, and winding up with the warning that the only knowledge is that which is based upon figures. " New scientific methods, new standards of logic and accuracy [that is to say, statistical methods and arithmetical standards] have fought their way to the front, and both in pure science and in medicine much of the work which may be done in the future on tbe old lines can only be looked upon as dogma or as quackery." Alas I we are all on the wrong track. Medical students should discard their textbooks of anatomy and physiology, of surgery and medicine, and go back to the pure fountain head of Todhunter, Colenso, and Cocker. Figures are your only facts. Those enthusiastic but misguided investigators who pretend to have proved the transmission of the malaria parasite by the mosquito are parading ignorance and dogma as knowledge. They lived in a mosquito-proof hut in a malarial district, but they have no statistics to offer. They never counted the mosquitos that did not bite them, and therefore their observations are of no value. They did not get malaria themselves, and they sent mosquitos to England and pro cured them to bite people who did get malaria, but they, never counted the people in England who did not get malaria, and so their teaching must be looked upon as dogma and quackery. When Professor Pearson sought for information about feeblc-mindeduess, he " was at once struck by the extra ordinary absence of accurate [by which he means statistical] investigation." He could find: "(1) No adequate anthropomorphic measurement. . . . (2) No psychometric investigation of children in this country on any reasonable [that is, statistical] scale at all. (3) No work done worthy of the adjective scientific [that is, statistical] on either the heredity factor or the environ mental factor." Professor Pearson has no difficulty in quoting dia metrically opposite opinions on the causation of feeble mindedness, and he revels in exposing the absurdity of the extreme Mendelians, who look upon feeblemindedness as due to the absence of a unit character that exists in tho normal human being. We might as well, though Professor Pearson does not say so, look upon failure to attain tho stature of six feet as due to the absence of a six-foot unit character that exists in the six-fpot human being. No one has a keener eye for the absurdity or the weakness of an opponent's position than Professor Pearson, but surely no one was ever more blind to the weakness of his Own. He never realizes that medicine includes the art of treating individual cases, or that in treating individual cases a knowledge of means and averages is useless, and if applied to individuals may be much worse than useless. Tho supposition that a person should be secluded as feeble minded because he could not pass some anthropometrical test devised by Professor Pearson, or some psychometric test invented in a psychometric laboratory, is ludicrous. A feeble-minded person is, in Professor Pearson's own very appropriate term, a " social inefficient," and the test -the proper test, and the only test?by which he can be tried is his social efficiency. In other words, can he fend for him self? Can he so manage his affairs as to be a useful member of society and not a burden on it ? If not, is his' inefficiency due to mental defect ? No anthropom?trie or psychometric measurement is of the slightest value besido this test, or ever will be. Professor Pearson makes the mistake, which is not very uncommon, perhaps, but which comes ill from one who 1 Mendelism and the Problem of Mental Defect, III.

REVIEWS, [ The British Medical Journal poses as censor scientiarum, of confusing "mental" with " intellectual," and distinguishing "moral" and "instinc tive" (in the sense of instinctive desire) from "mental." These aro elementary matters of nomenclature in which we are prepared to find amateurs and the laity ignorant, but when a professor lectures us on our ignorance, our dogmatism, our quackery, our want of honesty and of logic, we may suspect that he is not omniscient.</page></plain_text>
