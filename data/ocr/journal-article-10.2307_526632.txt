<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavations at 'Sandygate', Cold Bath Road, Caerleon, Gwent* By EDITH EVANS INTRODUCTION n January 1985 the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust was alerted through its Planning Control system to the fact that planning permission was being sought for the erection of infill housing in the garden of 'Sandygate', Cold Bath Road, Caerleon SS 337907 (FIG. I). The area formed part of Barrack Blocks IX and X in the Prysg series and had been descheduled after Nash-Williams's excavations in the 1920s. However, as it appeared that these excavations had left much of the archaeology intact, the Trust recommended to Newport Borough Council that planning permission be refused on archaeological grounds. At the same time, the possibility of rescheduling the area was explored with Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments; but because of the small size of the area involved rescheduling proved to be impossible. This left the fate of the area in the hands of the Borough Council, and whilst the Planning Committee was not prepared to refuse permission, it agreed to write a condition of excavation into the planning consent. No money was forthcoming to finance the work, but as a Manpower Services Commission Community Programme scheme was already being operated by the Trust to carry out rescue excavations in Caerleon, personnel from this scheme were able to carry out the necessary work. The 1927-29 excavations in the Prysg Field' were not only very extensive, but were also the first to take place on barracks in Caerleon. In consequence, the results of all subsequent excavations on barrack blocks for the next fifty years were interpreted in the light of the conclusions drawn from the Prysg.2 Whilst a re-evaluation of the dating evidence from the Prysg has been undertaken by Mr G.C. Boon,3 the quality of the excavation records was not * The Trust would like to thank the landowner, Mr L. Hill, for his support. The excavation was supervised by Miss D. Baldwin, on-site finds processing was undertaken by Mr M. Heames, with advice on the lifting of the Victory plaque being given by Ms K. Hunter. The drawings were prepared in the Trust's illustration department under the supervision of Mrs S. Railton, apart from the drawing of the Victory which was prepared for the National Museum of Wales by Mrs A. Leaver. I am particularly indebted to Mr R. Caple for allowing me to draw on his knowledge of building site practice and structural techniques. I would also like to thank Messrs H.S. Owen-John and A.G. Marvell for reading the report, commenting on the interpretations offered and correcting my grammar: any errors remaining are my own. yV.E.

The projected destruction of a part of Block IX gave the opportunity to provide such a re-evaluation in the light of modern excavation techniques. Since the excavation of the Roman Gates site (Insula XVII) in I98o-814 produced results radically different from those of Nash-Williams's Prysg exca- vations, a watching-brief on the foundation trenches of the new houses alone was clearly inadequate for re-evaluation purposes. However, as no money was available for the reconsolidation of the site, it was not possible for financial reasons to excavate in the area where the new buildings were to be erected. It was therefore decided to excavate in the area designated for the gardens, and to relate the sequence thus established to the foundation trenches by means of a watching-brief. The area originally opened, in December 1985, was approximately 45 sq m (PL. IX). For reasons of safety, however, it had to be reduced successively as excavation proceeded: the final area open at the level of the first period of occupation was only about 15 sq m. A further safety hazard was caused by the presence of considerable amounts of loosely packed rubble and tile in the backfilling which constituted the upper part of the section. This led, unfortunately, to several collapses, so it was not possible to draw all parts of the sections. As excavation took place during the winter and early spring, weather conditions were far from favourable. In particular groundwater was a considerable problem; the lower deposits being permanently below the watertable. Open-sump pumping allowed excavation to proceed, but the area was so small that it was difficult to keep sufficiently clean and dry to identify and excavate features at this level. In spite of this, an initial phase of earthfast timber construction was identified for the first time in the Prysg Field area. It was hoped that the waterlogging of the early levels would have preserved evidence of the environment for the time at which the fortress was built, but although samples were taken, they proved unsuitable for the recovery of such evidence. Because of the restricted size of the excavation, interpretation was difficult, particularly in those layers which related neither to the stone building representing the last main structural phase, nor to the earthfast timber building(s) of the initial occupation. Although useful new information was gained, the results both here and at St Cadoc's Orphanage5 suggest that excavations on such a small scale are not suitable for answering most of the outstanding questions at Caerleon. The modern Prysg Field extends over the north-west corner of the fortress.6 In the 1920S it extended some 30 m further east along the frontage with Cold Bath Road, but this area was lost when 'Sandygate' was constructed. In Roman times this area formed the greater part of the right-hand side of the retentura and was occupied, at least during the main stone-built phases of the fortress, by a series of barrack blocks. The area re-examined in the 1985-86 excavations consisted of parts of Rooms 5, 8, 9, Io and the corner of Room 7 in Nash-Williams's Barrack Block IX.7 These rooms had been cleared out to offset level or below, except for Room 9 where one layer overlying the offset still survived. After the removal of the backfill, the whole area was drawn, and excavation proceeded in Rooms 8, 9 and io. Room 5 which had been half-sectioned by Nash-Williams was not re-excavated; at the end of the excavation the filling of his pit was dug out and the section re-examined, but 4 D.R. Evans and V.M.

EVANS was found to be cut by a pit dug through his backfill. Little could be added to the observations made by Nash-Williams on this section, which displayed stratigraphy very similar to that recorded in the other rooms. THE EXCAVATIONS THE TIMBER BUILDINGS (FIGS 2 and 3) The earliest phase of activity on the site was represented by the post-trenches and post-holes of either one or two earthfast timber buildings, together with the associated construction levels. No comparable timber building activity was seen by Nash-Williams in the 1927-29 excavations or by Casey at Alstone Cottage in 1971.8 This is not surprising. The area of excavation at Sandygate had by this time been reduced to c. 15 sq m and the level was well below the watertable: under these circumstances it was exceptionally difficult to keep the site sufficiently well-drained to see any features, let alone to excavate them. In the smaller trenches used by earlier excavators it would have been impossible. Two post-trenches (0o92, 094) lay partly within the area of excavation, and a third (o104) was seen in section in the side of the sump but could not be excavated. All had a square profile. Post-trench 092 (0.5 m wide and 0.37 m deep) was aligned east-west. It was at the northern side of the site as excavated at this level, and c. o.9 m south of the line of the later wall between Rooms 5 and 8. The eastern end of the trench lay within the area of excavations and was slightly rounded in plan. When the section at the western side of the excavation was cleaned back preparatory to drawing, the width of this trench was seen to have decreased to 0.2 m; it is therefore possible that this also represented a rounded terminal. In that case the length of the trench would have been 2.3 m. One filling was identified, 0o93, a heavy clay mottled in yellow, grey and pink. There were two oval post-holes (o96, o98) which appear to have been driven below the bottom of the trench, but it is possible, given the difficult conditions of excavation, that an initial bedding layer of similar colour and consistency to the surrounding subsoil was not identified. The two post-holes were 0.54 m apart: a third might have been expected to lie between o98 and the eastern end of the trench if the spacing were even, but no trace of another was seen. Trench 094 (0.36 m wide and 0.5 m deep) was also aligned east-west, and was situated nearly 4 m south of o92. It ran all the way across the excavated area (though part of it had been dug away by the sump opened to pump out groundwater) and had therefore a length of over 2.5 m. The filling 095 appeared identical to 0o93. There were two post-holes in the surviving section, one (ioo) nearly square, the other (102) circular, 0.5 m apart. Trench 104 (0o.35-0o.4 m wide and 0.47 m deep) ran north-south, but appeared only in section in the sump. It could not be traced in the main part of the excavation and it must therefore be assumed that its northern end lay somewhere in the area of the sump. The filling (io5) was a heavy clay mottled in grey, yellow and beige. These post-trenches were associated with a layer of grey clay (o91), apparently formed after the digging and backfilling of o94, which lay wholly beneath it and was dug directly into the natural, but before the digging of 0o92 and 104, which cut through it. o89 was a small pocket (0o.34 m across, o.11 m in section) of burnt material incorporated within o91. Either there were two phases of earthfast timber building,9 or o91 was formed during S J. Casey, in litt. " cf. Roman Gates, 22-5, where it is suggested that there may have been some structural modification to the Phase I earthfast timber version of Barrack Block A.</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT SANDYGATE'.

The area excavated was not sufficiently large to determine which was the case. Because of the extremely limited evidence for this period, extrapolation to the super- structure is not appropriate. LAYERS BETWEEN THE STONE AND TIMBER BUILDINGS (FIG. 3) Much of the stratigraphy of the site was composed of layers of clay, interleaved with patches of burning and fire debris. Because of the small size of the site (6.0o by 3.5 m) at this stage of the excavation, they could not be related to any identifiable activity below the level at which construction of the stone building began. The lowest of these deposits (o88, 125, o86, o87, o85, o83, 124, 082) were patchy in nature and had subsided into the underlying post-trenches, 092 and 094. The layers above them, o81 and o8o, appeared to have been laid down to level out the site; an interpretation which is supported by the great variations of thickness within each layer. All these contexts appear to relate to activities unconnected with the stone building. Above this another layer (071) of very mixed clays (pink, yellow, green, beige, grey) incorporated patches of rubble (072) and charcoal (078). Below Wall 004, a dark patch (076), over an area of o.85 by o. 19 m, was observed to follow part of the line of the wall, but its thickness was no greater than 0.02 m and it vanished when an attempt was made to define it. It is possible that this may be connected with the foundations of the stone building (see below). THE STONE BUILDING (FIGS 3 and 4) Only one phase of masonry building could be identified at Sandygate. Because of the small size of the area under excavation, however, it is possible that an earlier building, if one existed, might have gone unrecognized, if no walls or deposits recognizable as floors lay within the excavated area. As Nash-Williams had emptied out to offset level most of the rooms which were the object of this re-excavation, very little of the surviving stratigraphy is likely to belong to the period in which the stone building was in use. Its construction phases were represented by the actual remains of the building itself, and by a series of layers composed of makeup, builders' debris and charcoal, which extended from just below the bottom of the foundations to the level of the offsets (see below). The basic plan of the building appears to relate to a single phase of construction. Within the area of the excavation there were three groups of interconnecting walls with no physical contact between one group and another: i) Walls 003, 004 and oo9 could be shown to be of one build, since they were all bonded together. "' ii) Wall oo8 was bonded to 129, the continuation of Wall 003 to the east of Doorway 073, and 003 and I129 were set into the same 'foundation trench'. iii) Walls 002 and 113 were bonded to each other. All were of the same phase stratigraphically and constructed using the same techniques. "' Nash-Williams's general plan records the east wall of Room 8 (004) as being represented by the foundation only. This is inaccurate.</page><page sequence="7">S A B - --- - - 040 LIGHT YELLOW-BROWN 080 ---------- 039,089,087, 125 CHARCOAL - n . 024,026 DARK RED-BROWN SANDY CLAY 081 - --- 025 DARK BROWN CLAY AND GRAVEL 01 _ -" 02 .- 082 042 DARK ORANGE-BROWN SANDY CLAY 0"---c % - =-047 DARK ORANGE-BROWN CLAY 091 048,081 DARK BROWN CLAY -----124 049, 082 DARK BROWN/ BLACK CLAY WITH MORTAR 068,071 MOTTLED CLAY 080,083,088, 093,095 MIXED CLAYS 091 GREY CLAY 095 A CB 124 BROWN/BLACK CLAY AND CHARCOAL TRENCH 094 CUTN N TOPSOIL AND BACKFILL -040.39-009 WALL 040 Q__ 7- - .. ......" ,- i-- -- - 025   --" 024 Ri [026 0 _ 421 ------ ---- "- 127 B ----- _-------------J--T- _ -.049 -_ jC B -4 . 068 048 071 048 - 071--- ---------- a------ --- 0080 . . ? ,O*? --- -- _-- .__ S- - - UNEXCAVATED 089 1 091: oo 09 -091 124 088 125 087 093 O I II T T E 2Cm 0 16 ft 092 POST-TRENCH CUT FIG. 3.

Their foundations averaged 0.3 m in depth and consisted of two or three courses of interlocking pitched rubble or cobbles, or a combination of the two, set in red clay. Discontinuous patches of mortar were noted in 028, the foundation of 003, but they were probably associated with the rubble of which it was composed, rather than being intended as a bonding agent; for the matrix of this foundation was red clay. The foundation of Wall oo9 consisted of pitched rubble (030) over smaller cobbles than those used elsewhere (003), and in part of the foundation to 004 (035) large cobbles were used at the edges with an infilling of smaller cobbles, small stones and pieces of tile. Above the foundations was a single offset course (typical height 0.I m). No bonding material was noted except from some red clay in the offsets to 003 (027) and oo8 (058). The offsets consisted of a single course, typically o.I m high and projecting for approximately 0.I m on one (004) or both (oo8, oo9) sides of the walls above. Above the offsets the walls consisted of small, neatly dressed coursed rubble blocks, mainly of Old Red Sandstone, but with some Lias Limestone, measuring between o.15 and 0.3 m along the faces of the walls and o. I-o. 15 m in elevation. The width of the wall above the offsets was usually around 0.35 m, though some walls were rather wider in places. In most of the walls three courses of stonework with a height of up to 0.45 m were visible above the offset. No bonding material was present, the spaces between the facing stones being filled by dark brown loam, with no stones of any significance in the core. However, if the mortar bed 074 can be related to this building, it is possible that the walls may originally have been bonded with lime mortar (see below). Three possible doorways were identified, leading (i) from Room 9 to Room 8 (034); (ii) from Room 9 to Room 5 (o60); and (iii) from Room 9 to Room Io (073). 034 and o6o took the form of a continuous gap in the wall masonry. It was 2.6 m wide and straddled Wall oo9, with a straight joint at the northern side of o6o and a stone running across the full width of the lowest and only fully surviving course at the southern side of 034. 034 had been removed down to the foundation, but part of the offset survived in o6o. Above this, the line of 004 was represented by rubble (075, 126) which had been left upstanding by Nash-Williams. For this reason it was impossible to be certain that they were in fact doorways and not merely the result of robbing: the northern end of oo9 had certainly been robbed, possibly, if the doorway interpretation is correct, to remove the quoins. The third doorway, 073, 0.97 m wide, between Rooms 9 and io was formed by the gap between the south east corner of Room 9 and the north west corner of Room I I. The two lengths of wall on either side (003, 129), although in line, were structurally separate as no foundation lay under the doorway. This doorway was later blocked (PL. XI). The external walls The external walls were observed only in section during the watching-brief. As the foundation trenches for the new building were not on the same alignment, it was difficult to be sure of the exact thickness. Observation was also hampered by the instability of the upper levels. The general impression, however, was that the external walls were of similar construction to the internal ones, but wider,11 and that it was the external walls which were intended as the main structural supports. " See Prysg I, 136.</page><page sequence="10">112 E.M. EVANS The method of construction and the makeup layers From the bottom of the foundations upwards, the makeup or debris layers differed between one room and another, suggesting that they were put in as the walls were going up. Differentiation had in fact started slightly below the level of the foundations, suggesting that the positions of the walls had already been marked out. Layers below the bottom of the foundations A series of deposits of mixed clays overlay the general dump layers described above and could be divided into two groups, north and south of Wall 003/129 (o67 south of the wall, and o68, o69, 070 to the north). Above these was a possible mortar-mixing floor (074) which occupied the area underneath and to the south of Wall 003, but either did not survive to the north of this line, or had never existed except under Wall 004. This mortar bed consisted of a series of strips of mortar with irregular edges, respectively c. o.6 and c. I. I m wide (021) separated by, and partly underlying, two strips of clay with a further strip at right-angles (051, 053, 055) (PL. IX). The strips of clay ranged between 0.2 and 0.3 m in width. A patch of charcoal (o66) lay at the edge of the mortar, under the corner of 003/004. This group of contexts ran under Wall 003, apparently finishing with a straight edge on the line of its northern face.12 The corresponding layer in Room 8 was 049 which consisted of dark clay mixed with patches of mortar. On its east side 049 was bounded by the mortar which underlay Wall 004. An area of burning on the surface corresponded with a patch of charcoal (048) above, showing that a fire had been lit in this position and no attempt had been made to clean up the debris. Foundation construction Conventionally it is assumed that foundations were laid in trenches which had been dug through the underlying levels, whether these were specially deposited or related to the previous periods. Examination of the foundations and the stratigraphy of the individual rooms cast some doubts on whether this model could be applied to the building under discussion. Evidence relating to this stage of the building process can be summarized as follows: i) The positions of the walls were already visible below the bottoms of the foundations (see above p. io8); ii) There were no cuts for foundation trenches; the dark red clay which interleaved the stones in the foundations apparently being the same as that forming the bulk of the makeup in the rooms; iii) The stratigraphy between the bottom of the foundation and the top of the offset differed from room to room. In all rooms the makeup consisted of layers of clay of a mainly dark reddish colour and of irregular thickness. A larger amount of coarse material was incorporated into them in Room 8 (025, 026, 042, 047), with building material being particularly prominent in the upper levels. In Room 9 the clay layers (013, 015, 022, 037, 038) were interleaved with patches of charcoal (o19, 036), and the lowest layer (038) resembled more closely the dump levels below the bottom of the foundations. In Room Io a single layer (020) formed the bulk of the makeup with a very slight charcoal deposit and another very thin layer above. This distribution was reversed in the doorway between 12 It should perhaps be noted that in Barracks I ('pre-stone phase') and III-IV (stone phases) the mortar floors recorded by Nash-Williams were all in the corresponding position, though not in Block VII nor, apparently, in Block VIII (Prysg I, 45, 48, 49, 52, 55 and fig. 44, p. 59).</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT 'SANDYGATE', CAERLEON 113 Rooms 9 and 10 (043, 045, 046, 052). Although the thickness of the individual layers was variable, it added up to a total of approximately 0.4 m in each room. Although the interleaving of dumps of red clay with localized patches of charcoal is a constant factor in all the rooms and might thus be regarded as the result of a single operation, later cut by the insertion of foundations, the presence of layers of completely different composition suggests rather that the areas of the individual rooms had been demarcated before the dumping took place, particularly in the case of 038 which formed the bottom layer of the stratigraphy in Room 9. In this case, the only likely method of construction which would give rise to all the phenomena observed is one in which the foundations and the room makeup rose together. The foundations, consisting of cobbles or re-used rubble (presumably depending upon availability of materials) were laid course by course, with clay being inserted between the stones and dumped in thin layers into the rooms. There it was compacted before the next course of the foundations or layer of filling was added. The presence of patches of charcoal suggests that the builders were incorporat- ing their debris in the makeup as they went along. For the purposes of making up, Rooms 9 and Io appear to have been treated as separate units, in spite of the fact that they were not divided by a foundation.13 Wall superstructure and mortar survival In general, the walls survived to a maximum height of 0.45 m, or three courses. Evidence that they had risen somewhat higher was seen in the partial collapse of Walls 002 and oo8, apparently occasioned during Nash-Williams's excavations.14 His notes for the section through Room 5 record a layer of 'tile and stone debris' below the topsoil. The loss of this material makes it difficult to offer any informed assessment of the character of the upper part of the walls. With regard to the surviving portion of the excavated walls, no bonding material of any description was noted in any of them above the level of the foundations, the spaces between the stones being filled with dark brown loamy soil (the exception to this being Offsets 027 and o58 which, like the foundations, were bonded with red clay). The question therefore arises: was there originally any bonding material in the main part of the walls? Use of lime mortar in the walls of barracks appears to be common at Caerleon.15 It was noted at Myrtle Cottages in the first stone barracks ('good quality yellowish mortar'), the third-century rebuild of Barrack V ('white mortar' used in the outer wall) and the fourth-century remodelling of the centurion's quarters in Barrack VI ('thick sandy mortar' used in the outer wall) and the fourth-century remodelling of the centurion's quarters in Barrack VI ('thick sandy mortar'). " Unfortunately there is no indication as to whether it occurred only in the walls singled out for mention or in others also. The exception to this is the description of the first stone barracks where it is noted as a general characteristic, although even here it is by no means clear whether mortar occurred in every wall. At the Croft 'where the actual wall remained it could be seen to have been built of thin, squared, sandstone blocks in red mortar; the Period 4 rebuilt main wall consisted of larger and less well-matched stones with only traces of red mortar'.17 Nash-Williams's notebooks for Vine 1 I am grateful to Mr R. Caple for suggesting this model, based on his experience in building just after the war 'when virtually no machinery was available, but there was ample human labour' (in litt.). 14 But was not well enough preserved to allow for reconstruction. 1" In contrast with what seems to have been the normal practice in other forts and fortresses (see D.P. Davison, The barracks of the Roman army from the Ist to the 3rd centuries A.D. BAR S472 (1989), 2I9). 16 Myrtle Cottage, io8, 115, 120. 17 L.

EVANS Cottage record three different types of mortar used in the three stone phases of the barracks of Area XVII, but not the walls in which it was used. However, on the Roman Gates site in the same block, only two walls contained mortar at the time of excavation, of which only one came from the barracks (the east wall of Block B in Phase IV).'8 According to Nash-Williams's observations, the masonry of the Prysg barracks was . . . 'mortared, in the main, with a hard pinkish-white mortar similar to that used in the stone ramparts'."9 How does this relate to the evidence from the Sandygate site? No mortar, or anything which could reasonably be interpreted as a product of mortar degradation, was observed in or under any of the walls excavated at Sandygate. However, the presence of patches of mortar in the foundations of Wall 003 and in the mortar bed (074) in the makeup layers, where some of the mortar was in a reasonably good condition and none of it was badly degraded, would seem to indicate that the lack of mortar in the walls was not caused by the acidity of the soil on this site.20 If the walls were not bonded by sand/lime mortar, what is their structure likely to have been? The most obvious alternative is drystone. It is difficult to provide a definite identification for such a construction method at the Sandygate site: in none of the walls studied was there any system whereby the two faces could be tied together, either by through headers21 or interlocking stones, as would normally be expected in a dry-stone wall. However this need not be an insuperable difficulty, as 'such walls are stable if they are subject to steady vertical pressure from either heavy stone capping or heavy timber plate construction above and are not more than I m high'.22 (Cob or mud brick could also provide suitable loading.) Other possibilities are that the walls were bonded with clay, or that the loam which was found between the stones at the time of excavation represents the deliberate inclusion of an earth or earth/lime filling. In the former case, there seems to be no particular reason why any clay bonding in the upper part of the wall might have been replaced by loam while it remained in situ in the foundations, though the loss of the original adjacent contexts makes it impossible to give an informed assessment of post-depositional transforms. The latter technique is not one which is usually considered in relation to Roman buildings, but examples of its use were apparently noted by Ward.23 However, as he does not give specific examples, it is impossible to evaluate this claim or assess its relevance to the site. On the basis of the evidence from the Sandygate excavations it is not possible to come to any conclusion as to the identity of the bedding/bonding medium, if any, used in the walls. 18 Roman Gates (report forthcoming, 177). '1 Prysg I, 136. 21 The problems of mortar survival at Caerleon have not previously been considered in any detail: the acidic nature of the soil in many areas has led to total degradation and loss of the lime component in some mixes of mortar. This can be demonstrated in the canabae at Mill Street (report forthcoming) where, in the masonry buildings excavated on the site of Cambria House, floors of opus signinum were represented only by the crushed tile component; and the mortar of the walls was represented by a thick layer of sand above the foundations, apparently having migrated downwards leaving the gaps between the stones to be filled by loam. Within the fortress similar observations were made by Mrs Murray Threipland at the Croft where, in Period 2, some of the floors were of 'cement, now disintegrated, and recognised as a sandy level' (Croft, 42). 21 Only one through stone was noted in any of the walls (004), adjacent to the gap interpreted as a possible doorway. 22 R. Caple, in litt. 23 'Roman mortar .., did not always attain a high standard in Britain. Now and again it was a little better than a mixture of earth and lime and the latter has sometimes been removed by the solvent action of the moisture of the soil, leaving an earthy residue which has misled observers into thinking that puddled earth was used for mortar' (J. Ward, Romano-British buildings and earthworks (191 I), 256); see also M.E. Blake, Ancient Roman construction in Italy from the prehistoric period to Augustus (i947 and 1968), 309.</page><page sequence="13">EXCAVATIONS AT 'SANDYGATE', CAERLEON I15 It is however possible that the interior walls were treated in a different manner from the exterior walls.24 Small portions of two of the exterior walls were located in the foundation trenches for the new buildings: no mortar was seen, but under the circumstances of the watching-brief neither was dismantled to examine the core material where it might have been protected from soil activity. The building after its construction A second structural phase in the building was represented by the blocking of Doorway 073 (oi8). This was done with four to six courses of neatly shaped rubble blocks, rather smaller than those in the original masonry of the walls. There was neither foundation nor offset. Again there was no surviving bonding material. This blocking was inserted over a o.o8 m thickness of the type of deposit conventionally known as 'occupation material', containing charcoal and bone (041). Very little other activity can be shown to relate to the occupation of the building, since almost all of the rooms were emptied by Nash-Williams to the offset level or below. The exception was Room 9, which contained a layer (oIo) consisting of tile fragments in a red-orange clay matrix, covering an area of approximately 3.60 by 2.00 m or just over half of the excavated portion of the room and overlying the offsets of Walls 002 and i 13. Because of the compact and regular nature of its surface, this may have been deliberately laid, unless it represents trample by Nash-Williams's workmen. A pit, 127 (fill 024), against the north wall of Room 8, and Layers 04o and o39, which overlay both the pit and the makeup levels, may also relate to this phase if they do not relate to the construction of the building. In Nash-Williams's report on the tile stamps, a number are reported as coming from 'a layer of roof debris' in this block.25 As there is a very wide date range in the types represented, from Boon's Large Serif (Room 6) and Large Pi Numeral (Room I) of the last quarter of the first century to Antoniniana stamps (Rooms 30 and 32 of the men's quarters) and types which also occur in material post-dating Severan rebuilding at the back of the rampart (Rooms 12, 22 and 35 of the men's quarters),26 the possibility cannot be ruled out that this layer was hardcore connected with later activity rather than straightforward roof collapse.27 THE ROADS The watching-brief carried out during the digging of the foundation trenches to the new buildings produced no new information on Barrack Block X, but permitted a limited assessment of the interval road between this block and Block IX, and of the via sagularis. Via vicinaria Below the modern topsoil and general debris of the uppermost layer, the stratigraphy can be summarized as follows: 24 I owe this suggestion to Mr Caple. 25 Prysg II, 49, 55, 57, 58. 26 G.C.

I m Light brown sand Depth unknown The gravel surface was presumably contemporary with the use of the stone phase of Barrack Block IX, but the stratigraphic relationship could not be assessed. The only other conclusions which can be drawn from these observations are that the road was metalled only lightly28 and only in its latest phase, and seems to have been subjected to the same making-up processes as the building. Via sagularis Traces were noted, in one foundation trench, of what appeared to be a drain flanking the south side of the via sagularis and lying immediately adjacent to the north external wall of the barrack. In the other trenches the edge of the drain was not visible, but the southern side of the road was marked by flagstones, which may represent the original drain-capping still in situ. The instability of the sections prevented detailed investigation. DATING There was very little datable material from anywhere on the site. No coins were found. Timber building(s) No datable material was found. Stone building Three rooms of the stone building were excavated, but in none of them did the full area of the room lie within the excavation. The sections could not in all cases be cut back properly and examined, especially in Room io, as the quantities of loose rubble in Nash-Williams's backfill in the upper levels made them unstable. This may provide a possible explanation for the fact that the group of pottery from 05 1, the clay associated with the mortar bed in Room Io, (cat. nos 20-23) was significantly later. These vessels dated generally to the mid-late third century, and one (no. 22) was of a type which may possibly date as late as the first quarter of the fourth century. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the edge of Nash-Williams's sondage in this room, or alternatively that of a late- or post-Roman pit, might have been clipped and material from such a context accidentally included within 051. Leaving the material from this context aside, the pottery from other contexts connected either definitely (cat. nos 1-0o, 50-7) or possibly (cat. nos 25-49) with the construction of the building suggested a date in the late second or early third century. Taking both sets of material into account (and assuming that no. 22 comes from the earlier part of its suggested date range, since there is no other stratified material dating from the fourth century) there are therefore two possibilities for the construction date: a) A terminus post quem of the late second or early third century, the later material coming from an unrecognized disturbance; b) A terminus post quem of the mid to late third century. 28 Prysg I, 136.</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS AT 'SANDYGATE', CAERLEON 117 The preponderance of pottery dating to before A.D. 200 (at least 5:1 see below, 121) would appear to support the first hypothesis, but it should be remembered that there is no real proof that the pottery recovered from the backfill actually originated within this barrack. The loss of the upper part of the stratigraphy of the site makes it impossible to assess how long the building was occupied. CONCLUSIONS The results of the Sandygate excavations do not enable a complete reassessment of the Prysg Field to be undertaken; the area under investigation was too small. Nevertheless, it was possible to obtain important new evidence for two phases, the early earthfast timber phase and the final stone building phase. There were two limitations: first, the fact that the area of excavation fell entirely within one barrack block meant that the information obtained from that block cannot necessarily be extrapolated to others.29 Secondly, the levels between the timber building(s) at the beginning of the sequence and the stone building at the end could not be interpreted because of the lack of useful information, either from the layers themselves, or from their boundaries which in most cases lay outside the area examined. It has been suggested that, under normal circumstances when much of the legion was posted elsewhere, possibly only one century from each cohort was stationed at headquar- ters and therefore barracks would have been left standing empty:30 on a logistical basis it seems reasonable to suppose that individual buildings may have been reconstructed as and when necessary rather than as part of a single rebuilding programme. Be that as it may, the evidence from Barrack Block IX suggests that this block, or at least the centurion's quarters included within it, was constructed in its definitive form no earlier than the end of the second century or even the early third, rather later than the termini post quos suggested for the other barracks in this area.3' Is there therefore any evidence to suggest that there may have been an earlier stone building? The nature of the deposits below the foundations and above the timber building does not suggest that any of them had a structural origin, apart from the mortar bed (074). Although 074 is more or less co-terminous with Room io on its northern side (limits of excavation and safety constraints made its extent on the other sides impossible to determine), the pattern of clay strips within the overall spread can be interpreted as being related to a rather different layout, possibly with an east-west corridor running through the middle of what is now Room io, and a continuation of Room 004 to the south. If this were the case, did it relate to a version of the later second-/early third-century building which never got beyond the laying-out stage, or to a separate, earlier building? It should also be borne in mind that evidence from elsewhere in the Roman world shows that the officer's and men's sections of a barrack block were not necessarily a single entity: they might not be constructed at the same time or of the same materials.32 Although no trace was found during excavation of any walls or other floors relating to an earlier building, the small size of the area examined makes it impossible to rule out the existence of such a building, with walls beyond the excavated area or ephemeral in nature and with suspended timber floors. 29 See Roman Gates. 3 J.K.

EVANS Alternatively, it is possible that the sequence may have been truncated before the erection of the stone building. It is possible that at least some of the lowest levels below 074 (particularly o8o and o8i) may represent a process of levelling up, for which there is no evidence except for their thickness and irregularity. The Sandygate excavation showed definitively that buildings of earthfast timber construc- tion existed in this part of the fortress, but it is not possible to tell whether one or two periods of construction are involved, nor the date or dates of construction, nor whether the building or buildings were barracks. New information on the stone building relates mainly to the method of construction. Further interpretation is hampered by Nash-William's removal of almost everything contemporary with its use, so there is no possibility of assessing the length of occupation of the building, and there is no hard evidence for the walls above the surviving courses or for the type of flooring involved. Some evidence for doorways exists, but the interpretation suggested above for the doorways into Rooms 5 and 8 cannot be regarded as definitive. Both rooms would probably have been entered from Room 9, given the strong similarities between the plan of the centurions' quarters and one form of standard layout for the typical Roman flat of the imperial period, best known from Ostia.33 No evidence for roof structure survived in the current excavation: if Nash-Williams was correct in identifying one of his upper levels as a roof-fall, the data given by him suggest that the roof would have been of tile. At least some of this structure would have had a terminus post quem of the early years of the third century. THE FINDS THE POTTERY by D.R. Evans Abbreviations: Amphitheatre R.E.M. Wheeler and T.V.

Rep. i (1912) Discussion The present assemblage is small and the number of vessels represented in any context or phase may be considered as of little significance, when compared with the material already published from earlier excavations on this barrack and the rest of the Prysg. Such an imbalance would seem to render any lengthy discussion of the present collection inapprop- riate: however, the same citeria that were used to re-examine this barrack can be used to assess the pottery, and to a certain extent also to reassess the previously published material from this part of Caerleon. Before the significance of the range of material from the present excavations is detailed, some discussion of the results of earlier excavations is necessary. Previous work on the Prysg barracks The published pottery catalogue from the Prysg34 was entered on an Amstrad PCW 8512 and sorted using DBASEII. In order to concentrate on the development of the Prysg Barracks the pottery from the rampart area has been largely ignored. It is clear that the buildings in this area went through different stages of development from those of the barracks, and a simple comparison of the two areas produces a confusing picture. The greater part of Nash-Williams's pottery came from Barracks VI and VII. This is at least in part a reflection of the extent of excavation of these barracks, but whether this reflects the total number of vessels from the site as a whole or the criteria under which the published material was assembled cannot now be fully established. This distribution must at least in part reflect Nash-Williams's methodology. The general sequence of development within the Prysg barracks is quite clear. Although the structural evidence for the earliest levels is not detailed, an initial, if ephemeral, timber phase dating to the Flavian period was followed by buildings based on sill-beams; these in turn were followed by a phase of stone barracks. The stone phase is dated by Nash-Williams to C. A.D. I IO-20.35 After this phase of construction other work was, it seems, confined to modifications of the centurions' quarters of the barracks. As both Simpson"3 and Boon37 34 Prysg III. SPrysg I, I56. 36 G. Simpson, 'Caerleon and the Roman forts in Wales in the second century A.D.: Part I - Caerleon and northern Wales', Arch. Camb. cxi (1962), o105-7. 17 G.C. Boon, Isca: The Roman legionary fortress at Caerleon, Mon. (1972), I 16.</page><page sequence="18">120 E.M. EVANS have pointed out, the dating of the stone phase is clearly too early, and some at least of the barracks were not constructed in stone until the Antonine period. It also seems probable that only one barrack per cohort was occupied in the period c. A.D. 140-65. In the Prysg report there are vessels other than those mentioned by Simpson which have been misdated. Among these nos 70-4 should be noted. These are either Black Burnished ware or copies, and showing as they do an oblique lattice with a grooved line above the lattice, can hardly be earlier than the middle of the third century. No 74 is particularly interesting in that its provenance is given as the second set of timber buildings. This ascription cannot be taken at face value, however, and it appears that the recording of the stratigraphy in this area was somewhat blundered. The complete absence from the published or unpublished material of types of Black Burnished ware I, which would give a clear indication of fourth-century occupation,38 must be noted. More recent excavation gives a somewhat different picture. The Alstone Cottage Barrack (no. XII), which was constructed over a demolished fabrica in the Antonine period, had in its turn been demolished by the middle of the third century and the area covered in red clay.39 This may indicate that during the third century occupation was again limited to either one or two barracks. There is considerable evidence for later occupation elsewhere in Caerleon as is shown, for example, by the quantities of third- and fourth-century material from the area of the Fortress Baths,40 at 'Roman Gates',41 and the Myrtle Cottage Orchard.42 Whatever the interpretation of the form of the later occupation of Caerleon, some explanation may be needed for this phenomenon of differing intensities of occupation. Part at least of the answer lies in the misdating and oversimplification of the sequence at the Prysg, whereby vessels which predate the 'stone' phase are automatically given a Hadrianic-early Antonine date, and it will be demonstrated that this is clearly not the case. It should also be noted that there is something of a circular argument in the dating of Caerleon ware,43 and Greep has argued that Caerleon ware production may be extended into the 240s.44 Although the argument cannot be discussed fully here, the absence of fourth-century material from the Prysg and other areas of Caerleon may be explained by a contraction of the area occupied. There are few coins of third-century date from the Prysg, but there are Antoniniana tiles to indicate that occupation of some barracks can be extended into the 220s and probably beyond. One factor which may affect the date range of the pottery is the way in which it was selected. Because a large proportion of the pottery came from two barracks, an imbalance is created in favour of extending the final date of these two barracks in comparison with all the rest. The Prysg pottery includes very few types which can be dated earlier than the middle of the third century (nos 70-4), although Oxford products other than mortaria might unknowingly be included among the range of so-called legionary ware vessels from this site. Although some of the smaller number of Oxfordshire mortaria from the Prysg (included within nos 289-98) could date to the fourth century, it would be difficult, in the absence of other datable material such as flanged bowls, to sustain the argument that occupation of the barracks on the Prysg site extended much beyond A.D. 300.

A.D. 330-41. How does this general picture relate to the material from Barrack IX? Barrack IX In this barrack Nash-Williams reports pottery from Rooms I, 5, II, 13 and 17. Work was also carried out in other parts of the centurion's quarters in Rooms 3646 and Io, where a floor from the stone phase produced a coin of Trajan. In the rest of the barracks excavation was restricted, although the single vessel from Room 17 (no. 449) may indicate that at least some trenching was carried out. The fact that this vessel comes within Nash-Williams's 'miscellaneous' group may indicate that some selection was taking place, and the present excavation shows that the collection of finds from the Prysg must have been a haphazard process, with large numbers of vessels being discarded. The pottery from the present excavations The first thing to notice about the present group is the fact that very few vessels can be parallelled exactly in the previously published Prysg material; the second is that the number of vessels within the previously published material which derives from this particular barrack is fifteen. This represents less than 3 per cent of the 416 coarseware vessels published from the site as a whole. The third is that a fair proportion of the vessels published here (or included in the archive) come from the backfill. This material, although it need not derive from this barrack, certainly has its origin somewhere in the area. Taken as a whole the pottery dating from c. A.D. 75 to C. A.D. 200 outweighs that from the later part of the Roman period by a proportion of at least 5:1. The pottery (FIGs 5-7) can be divided into a number of groups, the first of which was contained within the north wall of Room io (nos I-io). The most important vessels from this context are a samian counter which dates to c. A.D. 160-90, about two-thirds of a late second-century cooking pot and a flat rimmed bowl of early Antonine date. The second group was formed of material associated with the transition between timber and stone (nos 11-19) and was composed of Hadrianic or Hadrianic/early Antonine material. The third group (nos 20-3), which is recorded as coming from below the foundations in Room io, is rather out of keeping with the rest of the stratified material (see below) in that it can hardly be dated earlier than the end of the third century. The fact, however, that one of the vessels is represented by two pieces which join with a clean break, one of which comes from a doubtful context, indicates that this group should perhaps be treated with some caution. The fourth group is made up of material associated with the construction of the stone barrack, but which includes 'build-up' material from between the timber and stone phases; the group is of considerable size (nos 24-49) and while it comes from a variety of contexts and possibly from a series of buildings and refloorings it is sufficiently homogeneous to provide a terminus post quem for the construction of the stone barracks. The latest vessel which can be dated on external criteria is unlikely to be earlier than c. A.D. 140. This date is reinforced by a stamped samian vessel dating to c. A.D. 160-90 (no. 44). 45 Prysg I, 131-3. 46 Prysg I, fig. 46.</page><page sequence="20">122 E.M. EVANS A fifth group (nos 50-7), which may be associated with the occupation of the stone barrack, complements but does not extend the date range of the other vessels reported. Finally we have the unstratified material (nos 58-64). All came from backfill, probably but not certainly derived from the earlier excavations of this barrack, but certainly from the Prysg. None of it need be later than the end of the third century and any strays (nos 63-4) need be no more than drift from the areas of Caerleon which were occupied in the fourth century. In the absence of late coinage from this barrack and the fact that there appears to be no securely stratified pottery later than the end of the second century, it is necessary to turn to the other datable material from this barrack. The most important is the Antoniniana tiles, which can be dated to A.D. 212-13.47 Three came from the original excavations at the Prysg, two from roof debris in Room 32 and the third was unstratified, in the area of Room 36 (Prysg II nos 33, 34 and 36), a clear indication that this barrack was re-roofed (noting Boon's caveat concerning re-use of tiles) in the Severan period or later. Even though the group containing third-century and perhaps later material should possibly be written off as unstratified, the pottery from Room Io tends to reinforce the conclusion that occupation within this barrack continued throughout the third century. The absence of pottery certainly later than the end of the third century from this barrack and to an extent from the Prysg as a whole (including the store-buildings) suggests that occupation of these barracks did not continue much beyond A.D. 300. The picture of differing intensities of occupation of the Caerleon barracks is confirmed when comparison is made with another area of barracks at Caerleon, the Myrtle Cottage Orchard site, where considerable quantities of fourth-century coinage and pottery48 were recovered from a smaller-scale excavation.

The usual arrangement of triangles is in circles or arcs, as in Oxfordshire ware (Oxfordshire 39). A rare type of Lyon ware (Fine Ware, Type 26) has similar decoration and may also have a parallel form.

XII and FIG. 8) is published in detail elsewhere,53 and an abridged version only of that report is given here. The flat panel is substantially complete and appears originally to have been of trapezoidal form, 262 mm long, 162 mm wide at the base and tapering to 102 mm at the top. Where the edge is preserved, it is slightly curled over in a way which suggests that it might once have been attached to a backing-plate, but of this no trace remains; two holes punched near the top of the piece need not be primary. The plaque is made of thin sheet bronze (I mm or less), unplated, and retains on the rear extensive traces of a filling of lead-tin solder applied to give mass and strength to what would otherwise have been a most fragile product.54 The image, raised in repouss6, is a delightful portrayal of a winged Victory bearing an anthropomorphic tropaeum, all set on a bare ground. It is executed to a high standard, and much attention has been given to the overall balance of the composition, most noticeably in the deliberate omission of the expected projection of the right wing from behind the figure. Victory, in an elegant frontal pose, wears a loose-fitting chiton, clasped at the shoulders and girded at the waist; her head is modestly downturned and her strongly-waved hair, parted at the centre, is brought to a roll of locks above the brow and is apparently drawn back into a bun. The trophy takes the usual form of a manikin made up of a cruciform structure, with tree-trunk shaft, decked with armour to lend it human appearance. It is much scaled down in proportion, made askew to its shaft, and appears almost to be tucked into the corner so as to leave prominence to the Victory. It comprises helmet (with brow-plate, cheek-pieces and crest), muscle-cuirass (with pteryges), and opposed pairs of oval and trapezoidal shields; the flared mouths of two trumpets project upwards from behind the shields, and markings on the face of the trapezoidal shield may be meant for another. The general representation of Nike tropaeophore"5 is of Hellenistic origin, and enters Roman iconography quite fully formed in terms of conventional depiction and symbolic content. Consequently, little can be said of the dating of the piece, the armour of the trophy having a distant Greek and Gallic origin. Despite the frequent occurrence of the general arrangement in various media, close parallels to the present composition in Roman art are remarkably few: the best is given by the reverse of a medallion of Marcus Aurelius (of A.D. 148-9), now in the Gnecchi collection of the National Museum in Rome," which image shares the downturned head and much other detail. If nothing else, this dated parallel demonstrates that this particular representation was one current in the mid second century A.D., and so reinforces the broadly second-century date which is implied by the findspot (see discussion above, I I6). The purpose of the plaque is obscure, and no entirely convincing identification can be put forward here. The trapezoidal (not rectangular) shape would appear to preclude identific- ation as furniture encrustation, and whilst the findspot and subject matter may combine to suggest that the plaque may have been some item of parade armour, it does not answer in 53 J.D. Zienkiewicz in Antiq. Journ. forthcoming. At the time of writing, the piece remains the property of Mr L. Hill who kindly loaned it to the National Museum of Wales for display at the Roman Legionary Museum at Caerleon. 51 Metallic compositions confirmed by XRF analysis, courtesy of Dr M. Pollard. -5 For the iconography of the trophy, and its association with Victory in Greek and Roman art, see G.C.

Dr Garbsch, the expert on that subject, allows (in litt.) that the plaque is of appropriate size to have served as the frontal of a horse chamfron, albeit one of unusual form and without surviving trace of the hinges which would have attached the perforated eye-pieces; and for the present this must remain the most attractive possibility. In that respect, the closest parallel is provided by a frontal-plate from Eining, depicting Victory alone, and probably of third-century date.58 Context 020 (make-up level associated with construction of stone building).

Buckles of this type are dated to the second half of the second century and the first half of the third.59 They are continental in derivation and of predominantly auxiliary use with concentrations on the Upper German-Raetian Frontier and on Hadrian's Wall, but their presence on legionary sites is sufficient to prompt the suggestion that their use was not confined to auxiliary troops.

Isings, Roman Glass from dated finds (I957), 63-9 Discussion Thirty three fragments of Roman vessel and window glass were found during the excavation, as well as one glass object, the head of a glass-headed pin (see 'Objects of copper alloy' no. 3). Twenty one of the vessel fragments come from bluish-green square and cylindrical bottles, Isings Forms 50 and 51. The two forms were in common use during the first and second centuries. It is difficult to say how many bottles are involved or indeed to know which is the dominant form with only so few identifiable fragments. Two jugs are represented by handle fragments, in natural coloured green and pale green glass (FIG. IO, 3). It is not possible to determine the shape of either vessel, but the colour of the glass and the types of handle point to a first-/second-century date. The only piece of fine vessel glass found is from the body of a vessel, pale blue in colour, with parts of three horizontal corrugations extant; it could come from a number of different vessels. Ten fragments of window glass were found, all of the matt/glossy type, with one rough and one smooth surface. This type of cast window glass was in use from the first to the early third centuries. Two fragments have rounded edges and one fragment is crozed along one edge in order to fit the frame. The most interesting piece is a rounded corner fragment with a tool mark on its upper surface (FIG. IO, 6). The mark is left by the tool which pressed the glass into the corner of the mould. A similar piece was found at Exeter.61 Catalogue Vessel glass I Fragments from the handle and upper body of a jug, in natural coloured green glass, with many bubbles (FIG. IO, I).

Evans A small amount of smithing slag together with a fragment of hearth-lining was recovered from the site. All pieces came from the pre-stone phase of the site. Such material is common at Caerleon and either indicates a spread of material from a main smithing/ smelting area or the local production of artifacts, such as nails, using a mobile forge.62 The material could be drift from the presumed fabrica at the Alstone Cottage site.63 Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust, Swansea This paper is published with the aid of a grant by Cadw 62 See P.
