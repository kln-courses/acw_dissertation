Manfredo Tafuri, sketch of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger's project for the bascilica of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, interior views Manfredo Tafuri A Search for Paradigms: Project, Truth, Artifice Manfredo Tafuri founded the history department of the Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia in 1976 and chaired it until his death in 1994. Ricerca del Rinascimento: Principi, citta, architetti (Turin, 1992) was his last book. In the fall of 1996 Yale University Press will publish the English edition from which the present introduction and first chapter are taken. Translated by Daniel Sherer Assemblage 28: 46-69 English, translation @ by Yale University Press Foreward to Ricerca del Rinascimento For some time now, the culture of architecture, reflecting on itself, has sensed the presence of an "original sin" that de- mands exculpation. Close examination shows that this phe- nomenon is not restricted to architecture. To cite the most evident example, few critics can rationally examine the bad conscience that afflicts contemporary art without referring to modes of life deriving from a "liberation" from value, the suc- cess of secularization, and the spread of modem nihilism. A comprehensive analysis of the problem is equally hard to find: all too often the anxious search for a means to overcome the malaise of contemporary art and architecture ends in formulas that obscure the problem behind clouds of anesthetic smoke. The postmodem slogan (which I have identified as a "hypermodemist" version of the will to supersede the past) is among them.1 Yet our focus should not be confined to a single phenomenon. The current theoretical habitus does not differ considerably from others that have determined twentieth-cen- tury aesthetic choices; in fact, it reproduces the familiar com- pulsion to overturn the dominant order. This hypothesis seems useful when trying to untangle recent debates on history and memory. The "evil" identified in them would seem to be a kind of collective amnesia agreed upon in advance; moreover, one hears that excision of the roots of culture - whether ascribed to the historical avant-gardes or to a mythical "modem movement" - can only be reversed by a sort of"mnemic therapy." Strangely enough, this urge for cul- tural anamnesis often produces montages that emit ambiguous 47</page><page sequence="2">N ------ wmw ii -~op I 2r  . ti</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 28 messages. To adopt a different metaphor, this need has cre- ated a kind of sphinx whose responses to our questions are at best obscure. In this particular case, the meaning of the ques- tions escapes those who are compelled to ask them. With a more elevated cultural pathos, Hans Sedlmayr formu- lated a critique (reactionary in all senses) centering on the concepts of "loss of the center" and the "death of light. "2 Fortunately for us, the reception of specific moments in the history of modern criticism permits a "bracketing off' of the ideological sign originally stamped on them. For example, it is difficult indeed not to sense the close affinity between Sedlmayr's intuition of loss, Walter Benjamin's concept of the "decline of the aura," and Robert Klein's reflections on the "anguish of the referent. "3 "A unique correlation between space and time" - thus runs Benjamin's definition of the aura - "a singular appearance of distance, however close the object. "4 Is not this "appearance" bound to the founda- tional character of the referent in Renaissance and baroque art? The aura's dissolution, it would seem, corresponds to the crumbling of these a priori foundations (a phenomenon Ben- jamin tried to evaluate in its different moments). Moreover, it is crucial that the crisis inhering in the project of a mathesis universalis made explicit by the art work was assigned by Klein to a point in cultural history considerably prior to the disappearance of figuration from painting - in the era of the triumph of linear perspective and "naturalism. "' That we are thereby faced with the aesthetic equivalent of a homicide or a mass catastrophe is not a foregone conclusion. In light of these reflections, terms such as loss and decline exhibit a surfeit of meaning. Let us replace the word anguish with a more neutral term such as accomplishment. Having done this, the disappear- ance of the referent comes to resemble its displacement. That which founded the relation between beauty and truth (the harmonic "analogism" characterizing structured syntactic systems) is thereby eliminated. The effect of this is most clearly legible in the nineteenth century: by then, the theo- retical enterprise had already begun to register a kind of anguish when confronted by an architecture that was becom- ing increasingly self-referential. It would be facile to reduce this complex process to a linear pattern. Yet, by the first de- cades of the twentieth century, this same process was considered a form of liberation by its apologists and an irresistible force by its detractors. Thus, from the 1960s on, architecture's "imma- nent" trajectory was subject to critique from all sides. This must be treated as a specific historical phenomenon. Acceptance of this analysis raises an inevitable question: if the origins of the aforementioned anguish are to be located in the humanist affirmation of the subject, how can one hope for a recovery based on subjective volition? Here it would be pointed out that a "foundationalist nostalgia" typical of contemporary architecture is not confined to the compulsion to quote. It is from reflections deriving from an opposed tendency, however, that the problem has been posed most lucidly.6 In fact, the aforementioned nostalgia results from a need for legitimacy whose symptom is the incessant prolifera- tion of theoretical instruments. It would be superfluous to remind ourselves that the cult of the fragment and the disappearance of every form of telos are condi- tions of the age. Nevertheless, it is more important to recall how many of these cultural phenomena have been read as signs of eclipse. From Klee to Le Corbusier, the protagonists of modem art have silently transformed the fragment and absence into motives for a profound reflection on totality and semiotic pleni- tude. Perhaps, only after having penetrated to a realm beyond every law that claims to be absolute - to a place where the "spirit of destruction" acquires a constructive vocation - does it become at all possible to examine the meaning of the law.7 Let us recall Mies's Seagram Building or Le Corbusier's Chandigarh: are they not, in some sense, interrogations of the very principles of European rationality? And are not questions of this sort located at the center of the "ironies" of a James Stirling? The reflections that have served as the basis for Ricerca del Rinascimento stand out against this horizon. Formulated in the space where the present finds its problems, they attempt a dialogue with the "era of representation." I have taken pains to maintain this horizon: no predetermined actualization is of- fered to the reader.8 Instead, he or she will confront the uses of representation as they develop at the threshold of the era con- ventionally known as the modem: uses that are multiple and problematic, that vary from artist to planner to patron. As a consequence of this "problematic" situation, the "Renaissance" 48</page><page sequence="4">Tafuri that appears in the title certainly has not been taken for granted. Nor has the analysis of those paradigms guiding modes of behavior over the course of the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, conditioning their reception. The story re- counted in the first two chapters requires reflection on this process. Using this as a point of departure, and employing the critical instruments at the historian's disposition, it may be possible to propose a "work of mourning" with the aim of enlarging the scope of those questions that possess the power to shape contemporary architecture from within. For remem- bering does not signify a lingering on the sweetness of memory; nor does listening refer to idle distraction by sounds. This book marshals the "weak force" of historical analysis against these mnemic abuses. This is part of a more ample process that leaves the problems of the past living and unre- solved, since they continue to affect (and to disrupt) the present as we know it. A Search for Paradigms A bewildering system of replications, a treacherous con- spiracy, a cruel and irreal comedy: the first collective manifestation of humanism in the visual arts assumes dis- concerting, even sinister connotations. The text in question is the Novella del Grasso legnaiolo, the account of an elabo- rate ruse Filippo Brunelleschi perpetrated at the expense of the hapless intarsia craftsman Manetto Ammannatini around 1409.' Collaborating with the architect were, among others, Donatello and Giovanni Rucellai. A large number of versions appearing between 1430 and 1490 re- count the machinations set in motion by the creator of the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore. Particular importance at- taches to the version dating to 1489, which scholars have unanimously attributed to Brunelleschi's biographer, Anto- nio di Tuccio Manetti.2 Dante scholar, mathematician, associate of Girolamo Benivieni, and in his later years a follower of Girolamo Savonarola, Manetti gives literary form to a rich narrative tradition: After Brunelleschi died it was related by those who heard him speak of it at many different times, from Antonio di Matteo da le Porte,3 Michelozzo, Andreino da San Gimignano (his disciple and follower),4 Scheggia,5 Feo Belcari,6 Luca Della Robbia, Antonio di Migliore Guidotti,7 Domenico di Michelino,8 and several others. This transpired despite the fact that part of it had already been written down (though not more than a third of the entire story, which was, moreover, filled with inaccuracies).9 Clearly, this text asks to be read as accurate historical testi- mony. For Manetti, the practical joke played on the carpenter reflects qualities characteristic of its instigator - qualities amply recognized by his contemporaries. The Novella narrates a conspiracy even as it conforms to the pattern of a "healing ritual."'" The famous architect decides to punish Grasso the carpenter for no other reason than his fail- ure to attend a Sunday dinner hosted by a group of Florentine artists. This group subsequently decides to trick Grasso into believing that he has become someone else. They think that the most effective way to accomplish this is to have all who meet him address him as Matteo Mannini. A painful series of mishaps ensues. First, Grasso is imprisoned for debts owed by his double; he is then "consoled" by a man with literary pre- tensions who cites examples of metamorphosis drawn from classical mythology; finally, the brothers of Matteo Mannini, in a reversal of the narrative structure of the story, apprise him of the strange confusion of their blood relative, who believes he has exchanged identities with Grasso. As the carpenter experiences this, his horror increases. Even Matteo Mannini - who is also part of the plot - tells Grasso of mysterious dreams in which he assumes other personalities. At the outset, Ammannatini will have none of it. Before long, however, he begins to pretend that the metamorphosis actually did occur. In this, he follows the dictates of prudence - a virtue at once private and public" - goaded on by the twin fears of losing his sanity and public ridicule. In this way, the entire affair builds up to a violent, even sadistic, climax, when the carpen- ter, caught in a terrifying oscillation of conscience, really be- lieves he has switched identities. At this point, Brunelleschi achieves total victory. Only the intervention of Grasso's mother returns the carpenter to his senses. He does not protest, how- ever, after the affair is over. Deciding to start a new life, he moves to Hungary where, along with master Pellegrino delle Tarsie, he tries to find his fortune in the service of the condottiere Pippo Spano. 49</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 28 But the story does not end there. Returning to Florence, he is greeted honorably by the same group that tricked him. When he sees Brunelleschi he is reminded of the affair and begins to "laugh uproariously." At this point, Manetti adds a crucial fact: not once, but repeatedly, the architect asked the carpen- ter to recount the sequence of events as he experienced them. Thus the victim is subjected to a merciless examina- tion post festum: "during the course of which it came out that the most ludicrous things of all were contained in Grasso's mind.""2 Here the question arises, was Brunelleschi's mali- cious sense of humor the only reason he had Grasso tell the story as often 'as he did, as Manetti claims? The Novella has an ancient source. The chain of events narrated in it correspond to those set off by the interaction of Mercury and Sosia in Plautus's Amphitryon, which en- joyed a revival in the thirteenth century and was employed in the story Geta and Birria in the fourteenth." The affinity between the tale and what we know of Brunelleschi's cun- ning and sense of adventure is equally clear. Here, the architect pushes his intellectual powers to their limit, to the point, that is, of expropriating another self. Whatever else it may be, it is a strange use of one's intelligence. Nino Borsellino stresses the risks of the scheme, which questions "man's use of reason and its valorization in a Neoplatonic sense as emblem of the dignitas homini."'4 In addition to Borsellino's analysis, this text has benefited from magisterial readings by Decio Gioseffi, Andre Rochon, Giuliano Tanturli, and Gabriella Billeri, and has been reprinted in various recent editions." I shall analyze the Novella's implications in light of mentalities informing the "cosmos of architecture" in the era of humanism. In his 1949 reconstruction of the architectural principles in the age of humanism, Rudolf Wittkower did not cite Manetti's Novella.16 He had reason not to; instead, he fo- cused on mental habits and critical instruments that are a far cry from those implicit to Brunelleschi's cruel jest. Moreover, it is significant that his book enjoyed (much to its author's surprise) sudden and widespread currency among English architects in the postwar period. In 1955 Reyner Banham tried to evaluate this phenomenon, tracing it to the articulation of a theoretical body of laws imbued with universal claims." For our purposes, this kind of interest in a historical study on the part of architects seeking to legitimize their design instruments [strumenti di progettazione] can be seen as evidence of the "nostalgia for first principles" men- tioned in the foreword to the present work. To question at this point Wittkower's hypotheses - hypotheses that have touched off a series of debates, albeit articulated within terms laid down by Wittkower himself - it is necessary to explore new areas of historical analysis. Rather than focus on the formation of norms (the objective of a veritable avalanche of studies), it seems more useful to examine the way in which the "production of meaning" was conceptualized during the era that we have become accus- tomed to call the Renaissance. In this connection, we are immediately confronted by notions of transgression and li- cense that imply the problem of the limits within which these phenomena become "tolerable": a thematic ensemble dis- cussed, even more often than in Renaissance art theory, in Baldassarre Castiglione's Libro del Cortegiano (1528). Need- less to say, the term Castiglione uses to catalyze these motives is sprezzatura, or studied carelessness. Recent misuse of this term by art historians does not vitiate the richness of the concept.'" Castiglione, in fact, sets an idea of beauty with metaphysical implications in dialectical rela- tion to a notion of imitation based on selection from a multi- plicity of models. According to Baldassarre's Pietro Bembo, Beauty has God as its origin; furthermore, it is similar to a circle whose center is the Good. Just as the circle cannot exist without a center, Beauty cannot exist without the Good.19 Clearly, this is a Neoplatonic justification of beauty, however simplified: it brings to mind, for instance, related metaphors in the thought of Nicholas of Cusa.20 Indeed, Bembo in the Cortegiano enunciates a sacred cosmological principle that was destined to become a topos of art theory. Andrea Palladio's deeply felt encomium of "the beautiful mechanism [bella macchina] of the world" in the Quattro libri (1570) justifies his preference for churches with circular plans." There is nothing particularly new in this, even if, as scholars 50</page><page sequence="6">Tafuri have noticed, the Cortegiano superimposes ideas of grazia and utility in an exceptional fashion.22 In fact, Bembo as- serts, with reference to architecture, a link among values of venustas, utilitas, and firmitudo that is characteristically Vitruvian.23 All the same, the metaphysical definition of beauty is subtly undermined by Castiglione's theory of multiple models: As bees in green fields fly from flower to flower, so must our courtier gather grazia from that which seems to contain it and from each part that appears laudable. In this passage, Tuscan is not the only point of reference; as Castiglione affirms, it is valid to gather "splendid, elegant words from every part of Italy."24 Even "French and Spanish words that have become part of our language are accept- able.""25 Later we shall examine the implications of this con- cept of mimesis. Here it will suffice to recall that this idea was proposed earlier by Leon Battista Alberti in De pictura and that it subsequently appeared as an essential motif in Erasmian thought and in the work of Giovanfrancesco Pico; it is significant that Pico refers to this particular concept in his polemic with Pietro Bembo.26 But that is not all: Raphael, too, writing in 1514 to Castiglione (I would argue, not fortuitously) enunciates a pluralist conception of artistic models.27 As in the case of Alberti, the source here is the apology of Zeuxis. Thus [in this period] intense theoretical discussions on language had an impact on the spheres of literature and the visual arts. And, since the choice of models is assigned to the individual artist, the subject acquires an unexpectedly large role. This is evident in a characteristic passage in the Cortegiano: I maintain that good speech habits arise in persons with fine intel- lects whose excellent powers of judgment have been formed by experience and learning. And in this they all concur: words which seem apt are acceptable, since those who use them rely on a certain innate faculty of judgment, not on artifice or any kind of law.28 Castiglione goes even further: "use, more than reason," he argues, "has the power to introduce what is new and erase what is old."29 Here we encounter a threshold separating a concept based on natural and divine law from one that privileges a functional concept of language. Nevertheless, this threshold is crossed in a decisive passage where Count Lodovico of Canossa asks, Can't you see that rhetorical figures that lend grace and impressive effect to speech are gross abuses of grammatical rules, without excep- tion? These have been accepted and legitimized by use for no other reason than the pleasure they offer our ears; and it can hardly be denied that they bring sweet and delicate sensations with them.30 Thus, for Castiglione, linguistic practices generate their own laws of transformation independent of the individual speaker. Moreover, transgression is necessary for meaning. Ultimately, transgression serves as the foundation of linguistic law, not the other way around. This paradox seems to contradict the "circu- larity" previously attributed to beauty. Indeed, Castiglione's enthusiasm for grammatical "abuses" [abusioni] makes the antinormative nucleus of his aesthetics quite clear. The "quite general" [generalissima] theory of sprezzatura is closely linked to the notion of a language in perpetual metamorphosis and to the transgressive impulses that drive it. Under these conditions, a dynamic relationship is established between a "collective that speaks" and the individual subject. Here we should recall the position Castiglione assigned to Count Lodovico of Canossa, friend and patron of Raphael and Giulio Romano:3' I often ask myself, what is the origin of this grazia? Certainly, I must disregard those who claim that it comes from the stars. Indeed, I have identified a quite general law, which seems to apply to all human artifacts, be they verbal or nonverbal (as opposed to others produced in different ways). Indeed, one must avoid affectation as one stays away from a dangerous precipice: and when devising new expressions a certain sprezzatura is required, which realizes the word or the deed without apparent forethought on the part of the speaker or the doer. It does so by concealing its own art. As everyone knows, to do something well impresses everyone favorably. Con- versely, to overdo something is, as the saying goes, like pulling out one's hair by the roots: as a rule, this brings disgrace, making one estimate every thing as being of little worth, irrespective of its real value. One might say, then, that true art hides art. Nor should one force the issue: if discovered, all praise will suddenly disappear.32 In this critique of excess, Amedeo Quondam has recognized a search for an "interstitial" space. "Grazia" emerges between the poles of concealment and disclosure, nature and artifice.33 At 51</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 28 this point, we should resist the temptation to draw premature conclusions, despite the obvious affinities between the dialec- tic of artifice and representation and the theme of replication that opened this chapter. But it is clear that the "regula generalissima" adduced in the Cortegiano applies univocally to a single method, a general syntax of action and behavior pertaining to all forms of human endeavor, from civil conver- sation to the arts. Yet, as scholars have noted, the space that lends this type of poetics its mise-en-scdne is inaccessible to the public.34 Here, the language game is restricted to an elite group of conversationalists; close scrutiny reveals that its universality is confined to self-enclosed communities made up of select members. In other words, the game is a self- referential procedure founded on the model of a magic circle in which the court recognizes its own features. In a valuable suggestion and offering a similar interpretation, Edoardo Saccone has related Castiglione's concept of sprezzatura to the Aristotelian notion of eironeia.35 He also links Castiglione's neologism to the classical rhetorical tradition - that is, Quintilian's gratia and Cicero's venustas - even as he signals its close affinity with Pliny's nimia diligentia.36 To be sure, the technique of dissimulation is always a crucial factor; one recalls that before being subsumed by political theory in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, it played a central role in Alberti's Momus (a work we shall soon analyze). The Plinian nimia diligentia refers to Apelles's art of painting: this seems to confirm the connection between art and conduct in Castiglione's thought. Other aspects of the Cortegiano enunciate a theory of metaphor and defamiliarization that still has the power to astonish us: Now I suggest that you try to give words different meanings than is proper to them under ordinary conditions; as if, by grafting them like branches onto a more suitable tree, you could imbue them with new forms of beauty, and (as the saying goes) make their meanings appear before the eye or even play the words with your hands, if you will, to the delight of all who hear or read them.37 Thus linguistic transgression, custom, metaphor, and disso- nance achieve an intimate synthesis.38 Let us temporarily interrupt our analysis of Castiglione's apposite text to verify its congruence with sixteenth-century architectural culture. Antonio Labacco has noticed Donato Bramante's interest in one of antiquity's "capricious" excep- tions, the Basilica Aemilia.39 Francesco di Giorgio and Giuliano da Sangallo, on the one hand, and Baldassarre Peruzzi, on the other, explored "anomalous" exempla from the Imperial era, including edifices and complexes such as Hadrian's Villa, the Lateran Oratory of the Cross, the Trium- phal Arch at Orange, and the Temple at Baiae. Moreover, the most informed analyses of their architectural projects, whether planned or executed, show that their styles (as was already the case with Bramante) reflect a newfound interest in the infinite variety of the antique models. Alberti had already made this discovery. And, along with the search for organic relationships - the Albertian criterion of concinnitas - went a predilec- tion for the fragmentary. The Tempietto of San Pietro in Montorio, the Belvedere and the choir Bramante designed for Saint Peter's attest to it, as does Raphael's entire output (not to mention that of Giulio and Peruzzi).40 Furthermore, the aforementioned architects, as well as Palladio and Michele Sanmicheli, adopt the method of extrapolation that Casti- glione favored: the antique so often cited by these architects represents a collection of disjecta membra that are given "a meaning different from the one that should belong to them." Thus the impulse to innovate is grafted onto "a need for rules" left unsatisfied by Vitruvian precept: in effect here, too, transgression establishes the norm. In Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila or Villa Madama the internal logic of the organ- ism - axiality, the coherence of the orders, principles of specularity - is tacitly subverted by "language games": so many indications of a refined sensibility that presupposes an audience able to recognize and appreciate them. On the basis of these and similar considerations the notion of "mannerism" has derived its legitimacy.41 But the hypothesis that an age of unadulterated certainty was followed by a lacer- ating crisis cannot withstand criticism when the origins of the "all'antica" language are carefully scrutinized. Nor can one any longer seriously attempt to displace the crisis backward. The entire project of humanist architecture expressed an equilibrium, at once ardent and refined, between the search for theoretical principles and the experimental impulse. This situation encourages an exploration of the elements compos- 52</page><page sequence="8">Tafuri ing it informed by an awareness of new mental habits. The innovative tension and spirit of collective inquiry character- izing the Roman context in the years leading to the Sack of 1527 form a single phenomenon. In this milieu, as in the Cortegiano, a transformative approach to architectural lan- guage flourished. The primary instrument of this innovatory attitude was concealed transgression. The isolation of dis- crete architectonic phrases, in addition to the capricious uses to which they were put, constituted a medium of com- munication in its own right. A good example of this is Raphael's use of the Pantheon (preceded, needless to say, by Brunelleschi's and by Alberti's).42 From these synthetic citations, an almost precise correspon- dence can be verified between the aesthetic ideas expressed in the Cortegiano and the artistic achievement of the circle in direct contact with the persons who appear in the dia- logue.43 Obviously, we should not force the analogy. It would be nai've to propose an influence exerted by the ideas of Bembo or Castiglione on painters and architects; nor does a grasp of the aesthetic theories elaborated by these intellectu- als result from observation of the works in question." Rather, we can best explore this terrain by using as our guide the concept of diffuse mentalities: metalanguages that obliquely traverse the spaces of architectural language, determining their organization and liberating their potentials. We are hardly saying something new when we observe that architecture in the age of humanism walked a fine line be- tween the need for rules and the transgressive impulse. Yet the former (as opposed to the appeal to codified norms) is the crucial trend in this context. Here we confront a prob- lem that can be generalized over a wide temporal arc, begin- ning with the years after the Great Schism, moving through the plague of 1348, and culminating with the sociopolitical conflicts of the Quattrocento and Cinquecento. As a point of departure we shall take the legitimation of language through consuetudo. As far as architecture is con- cerned, this problem is posed in the clearest manner by Alberti. (Arnaldo Bruschi was among the first to notice this; later I shall try to verify his intuitions.) Alberti modified the universal claims of the humanist principia by applying an awareness of the distinct sites for which the architectural projects were intended.45 Centers such as Florence, Rimini, and Mantua were hardly indifferent to the humanist. Conse- quently, subtle reminiscences of ancient monuments serving as emblems of these sites are inserted into the texture of the Tempio Malatestiano, Santa Maria Novella, and Sant'Andrea. Later we shall discern affinities with Lorenzo Valla's philology in these attempts to situate the roots of an "uprooted" language (as is the case, moreover, with any "rebirth"). This aspect of Alberti only underscores the fact that he was not an isolated figure. Employing other instruments, to be sure, in Peruzzi's the last project for San Domenico in Siena46 and in some of Jacopo Sansovino's mature works, one can sense a return to tradition that the peremptory character of the nuova maniera seems squarely to oppose. It is hardly fortuitous that the con- siderations that bring our study to a close will include fresh analyses of this problem.47 Let us leave this historiographic hypothesis in statu nascendi. What we have uncovered so far implies a line of inquiry link- ing the themes of nature and artifice that Castiglione articu- lated to the architectural theory that Claude Perrault and Christopher Wren proposed at the end of the seventeenth century. These thinkers identified a dangerous fissure in the origin of beauty; for them, it was impossible to legitimate beauty without appealing to antithetical principles. In the Ordonnance (1683), Perrault states that proportion, the result of an artificial "agreement between architects," does not rely on natural laws. In this sense, its value is utterly relative.48 Already in the commentary on Vitruvius (1673), he proposes a "scandalous" theory that would draw the sharp censure of Frangois Blondel.49 Perrault writes: Architecture is founded on two principles, the first positive, the second arbitrary. The positive foundation is the useful or necessary purpose for which the building is constructed: that is, its commod- ity, firmness, and healthfulness. The principle that we call arbi- trary depends on authority and custom [autorite' et acouatumance]; even if beauty is in a certain sense based on positive foundations - be they reasonable propriety or the conformity of parts with respect to the use for which they were intended - nevertheless, ... we still refer to the judgment and approbation of those held to be competent in architectural matters. This impresses on our imagi- nation an idea that, whether we are aware of it or not, relies on the opinions of others.50 53</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 28 Consequently, transcendent truth no longer justifies the proportional scheme, which belongs to the realm of "arbi- trary beauty," vicissitudes of taste and choice that is sub- jective in character, albeit fixed by custom within precise parameters. The path toward subjectivism taken during the seventeenth century is inaugurated here (even if the polem- ics unleashed by Perrault's were considerable). It is perti- nent to recall that Claude's brother Charles developed similar ideas in the field of literature. As with Castiglione, architectural theory evolved alongside other disciplines; nor can one overlook the fact that Claude Perrault, professor of philosophy and pathology at the University of Paris, was a member of the Acad6mie des Sciences from 1666 onward. In this context, empiricism and relativism went hand in hand with "architectural mathematics." Antoine Picon acutely suggests that Perrault embraced innovative ideas "with prudence" in his capacities as physi- cian and hygienist. Yet it was in the field of anatomy that Claude proposed a distinction analogous to the one he introduced when searching for a definition of beauty: veritis de fait and veritis de droit form a conceptual pair comparable to the one that pitted nature against institu- tions. Moreover, in the preface to his Memoires pour servir a l'histoire naturelle des animaux (1671), he offers a radical critique of the classical habitus of analogy. In his view, one cannot establish that humans are more correctly propor- tioned than "the most deformed animals." Even so, "it is necessary to have recourse to a principle of measure, or modulus, when dealing with architecture: when one under- stands that the cosmos is one immense edifice, containing a variety of chambers of dissimilar structure, one has al- ready chosen a proportion from among the most noble to govern all others." Taking the empirical sciences as his point of departure, Perrault arrives at theoretical results relevant to architec- ture. A notion of simple, conventional measure replaces the previous proportional system, which was grounded in ori- gins at once metaphysical and divine. Perrault's subjection of natural history to disenchantment can be compared to his critique of an entire hermeneutic tradition. Thus he broke once and for all with the Renaissance "interlude." Furthermore, one should not underestimate the importance of the distinction between positive and arbitrary that Charles Perrault formulated in his Parallles des anciens et des modernes (1688-97) as a means of demonstrating the latter's superiority."5 But a corrective is in order: at this point, "arbi- trary beauty" is regarded as a precondition for fully actualized artistic fantasy.52 Yet again, the power that grounded relation- ships between divine and human creation has vanished: a sign that the dissolution of the principle of representation was already under way. Here a paradox emerges. AcoiAtumance, or custom - which also implies the plurality of traditions - is of primary impor- tance for Castiglione and the Perrault brothers, even though it assumes two distinct roles: first, justification of the innova- tive "word" and, second, legitimation of law, which, to be sure, has been identified with convention. A corollary to this is the critique of the natural or anthropomorphic derivation of the orders. These, writes Claude, are not endowed with "positive, necessary, or convincing beauty"; rather, their use is justified by an authority historically acquired.53 The distinctions drawn and instituted by Perrault reflect ideas circulating in Cartesian circles. Yet, inasmuch as it was not based on a naturalist paradigm, architectural beauty became subject to a rigorous process of rationalization. A faithful disciple of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the author of the Ordonnance recognizes the institutional character of the res aedificatoria, but subordinates it to laws at once provisional and inflexible. This maneuver presents affinities with the Logique du Port Royal, which maintains that the sign simultaneously sub- sumes the idea of the signifier and the signified. While Christopher Wren's architectural theory contains echoes of Perrault's position, it nonetheless sets the parameters of the architect's discretion with more strictness, giving "body" to the "voice" of traditions: There are two Causes of Beauty, natural and customary. Natural is from Geometry, consisting in Uniformity (that is, Equality) and Proportion. Customary Beauty is begotten by the Use of our senses to those Objects wich [sic] are usually pleasing to us for other Causes, as Familiarity or particular Inclinations.... Here lies the 54</page><page sequence="10">Tafuri great Occasion of Errors; here is tried the Architect's Judgement, but always the true test is natural or geometrical Beauties.54 In the present work, I do not intend to address the concep- tual nuances, filiations, and contradictions intrinsic to the architectural theories of Perrault or Wren. Nor is it my intention to emphasize characteristic aspects of their thought. Nonetheless, the discovery of the conventional and arbitrary character of architectural rule in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries should give us pause, despite its anticipations in the De re aedificatoria and the Cortegiano. Alberti's treatise does not adduce metaphysical principles. In it, the properties of number are regarded as so many learned facts, the relationship between music and architecture is divested of its previous cosmological and transcendent impli- cations, and aesthetic judgment is ascribed to an innate cognitive faculty ("De pulchretudine animis quaedam ratio efficiet").55 If we read the De re aedificatoria closely, it be- comes clear that Alberti has little to say about first principles. In fact, his entire approach to architecture is fraught with a sense of the unfounded character of the system he theorizes. On the one hand, the model he proposes relies on nature's inherent stability, which, to be sure, contains principles of infinite variability within itself; on the other, as we have already noted, Alberti fully approves of reliance on a plural- ity of models (advice clearly indicating a Zeuxian aesthetic). When surveyed in the richness and breadth of its manifesta- tions, the antique certainly problematized any attempt to extract immutable norms from its models. The anticanonism expressed in the Cortegiano really does find an anticipation in Alberti's treatise. Drawing on ideas originating in the circle of Raphael and Peruzzi, Sebastiano Serlio would iso- late "hybrids" [mescolanze] within the classical models them- selves.56 In this way, a subjective relation between naturalism and artifice was instantiated within the new architecture's body of principles. One result was the emergence of a con- cept of infinite syntactical variability. Moreover, Serlio - who presented himself now as rigorous Vitruvian, now as exponent of a critical antinormative aesthetic - was sensi- tive to local traditions. This is demonstrated, above all, by the flexibility with which he approached Venetian and French usanze in the projects and theoretical texts of the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Books.57 In this sense, linguistic pluralism carried on a peaceful co- existence with the idea of rule [idea di regola]. The latter permitted a confrontation between divergent experiences. Which is to say, as long as humanist inquiry continued, archi- tecture was not reduced to an abstract canon. Raphael knew that interpreting the antique was a pluralist enterprise:58 to revive this interpretation was to combine model and innova- tion, knowledge and invention, historical distance and the attempt to "surpass" the antique. In other words, the idea - perfect music of the created - cannot be reproduced. But it can be represented: in this sense, the interpretations it re- ceives, by definition imperfect, are capable of giving rise to a "chain" that is virtually infinite. Though the idea per se is unattainable, the architect can approach it through a process of refraction, experiment, and perpetual inquiry. Put differently, the anti-Ciceronian impulse implies a sort of permanent checkmate. [Under its aegis], no norm functions as a fundamentum inconcussum. Alberti's and Raphael's criti- cisms of Vitruvius are symptomatic of this attitude, which was modified during the second half of the sixteenth century.59 From a theoretical standpoint, the refusal to rely on a single model seems to originate in the same impulses that animated Erasmian thought and Pico's philosophy. The concordia philosophorum implied a form of truth capable of being known and transmitted only when mediated by interpreta- tions, thereby opening a space for the principle of tolerance. Thus, in this conception, tradition - the "handing down" [tradere] of knowledge - was inevitably bound to its own betrayal [tradire]. But if artifice is asked to coexist with nature, in what sense can the antique be considered a second nature? In a seminal essay on Bramante, Christof Thoenes has elucidated a funda- mental aspect of the Renaissance approach to this problem.60 According to Thoenes, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century artists were fully aware that the project of recuperating the antique was, for all intents and purposes, a fictive operation. "Rebirth" can only be simulation: the imaginative process that follows from this realization inevitably acquires implications of arti- 55</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 28 fice. Needless to say, Bruschi has identified the same phe- nomenon - which was not unique, by any means - in Bramante's architecture.61 Recent studies have demon- strated that the most distinguished architects in the Roman milieu used such "poor" materials as plaster and stucco in inventive combinations to obtain illusionist effects.62 Here the objective was to simulate the refined deployment of different types of marble and stone to add a new aesthetic dimension to ordinary walls. In fact, this was a prevalent norm: in this regard, a culture of simulation emerged that was separate from the culture of perspectival illusion. Imitation of antique models oscillated between two ex- tremes. On the one hand, aware of the irretrievability of a longed-for ideal, the mimetic canon was forced to rely on artifice and fiction. On the other, it did not renounce the attempt to transcend the model. The dialectic of imitation and simulation corresponded to the dialectic of nature and artifice. The slightest pressure applied to either side of this delicate equilibrium was sufficient to tip to balance toward the ludic, the ironic, even the comic - the path taken by such figures as Giulio Romano and Philibert de l'Orme.63 The artificial character of humanist culture is reflected in the Cortegiano as well. As Roberto Esposito has shown, the concept of sprezzatura presupposes a paradox: in the code of courtly behavior described by Castiglione, the maximum of naturalness coincides with the maximum of artifice.64 Simu- lation - a virtuosity able to overcome all obstacles without apparent effort - is identical with a mode of comportment deployed with specific objectives in mind. Pure spontaneity is its antithesis. Nor can one maintain that sprezzatura re- presses a "natural" way of acting. According to Norbert Elias, the civilizing process presupposes a gradual shift in mental paradigms: as with any historical process, it will not permit itself to be interpreted according to categories of progress and decline. On the other hand, a relation between a form of conduct that is "naturally artificial" and the calculating turn of mind that Jacob Burckhardt has identified as charac- teristic of Renaissance culture is quite plausible. It is self-evident that these considerations implicate the architectural cosmos of idioms developed in Florence, Urbino, Milan, and Rome. In these centers, preferences for the classical as a form of "second nature" respond to a new reception of the notions of numerus and ordo. Yet, in this connection, one's energies should not be spent on sterile polemics against those who uphold the continuity of West- ern ratio - even if, as Jacques Le Goff's work has demon- strated, the existence of a "long Middle Ages" that ends with the Industrial Revolution can hardly be denied.65 In historio- graphic reconstruction, hypotheses of continuity and discon- tinuity do not constitute mutually exclusive alternatives; nor do they suggest that the historian's task is to disclose tran- scendent meanings. On the contrary, they can (and do) coex- ist as parameters adopted to account for different cultural phenomena that emerge by virtue of the standpoint (which is fortunately mobile) of the interpreter. It is above dispute that processes of rationalization specific to the early medieval period and the fourteenth century did exist. Equally certain is the persistence of mentalities and codes of social comport- ment from the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries. This notwithstanding, it would be difficult to recognize in the medieval ateliers methods of planning and design homoge- neous with those of humanist derivation. The fundamental paradigms seem to have changed, even if one can hardly deny the coexistence of mental habits of traditional stamp alongside hypotheses of rupture and discontinuity. New systems whose objective was to construct and represent the subject and society frequently effected a total break with prevalent behavioral codes in the aristocratic and cultural centers of the Quattrocento and early Cinquecento. Pre- cisely this innovation seems to be a specific feature of emerg- ing techniques of expression. Art establishes a rule for itself in the form of a thesis in a state of tension with an impre- cisely defined future; close scrutiny of this process can only make us aware of the intense strains involved. Erwin Panofsky explained this problem by focusing on per- spectival method: Perspective is by its very nature a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it provides bodies with a space in which they can plastically unfold and move with a semblance of mimetic 'naturalism,'... on the other, it eliminates this space by allowing the human eye to absorb the world of things that exist autonomously before it.66 56</page><page sequence="12">Tafuri Perspective, then, presupposes the emergence of mathe- matized visual space with the dissolution of the medieval system of figuration - a process equivalent to the transla- tion of art to the realm of phenomena. In this sense, the perspectival concept opens religious art to the visionary realm. In this space the miraculous can be immediately grasped by the beholder; this takes place because supernatural events erupt into the apparently natural visual space belonging to them and which permits them to 'penetrate' to their supernatural essence. Furthermore, perspective imbues religious art with the highest form of psychological meaning, in whose context the miraculous is situated in the psyche of the person who is repre- sented in the work of art.67 Panofsky's fascinating conclusion can be subsumed (and, as it were, "betrayed") by the internal logic of the present argument. What is valid for the Renaissance concept of linear perspective is also valid for the classical language of architecture and the orders: theory and practice converge in the "construction" of the ultimate referent constituted by the work of art. It is my task to verify the historical moment at which this "referent" came to coincide with the architec- tural principles Wittkower analyzed. In the introduction to his study, Wittkower underscored the need to isolate traditional elements in Renaissance thought.68 But this program was honored more in the breach than in the observance when he analyzed one of its primary aspects, analogism: that is, the principle of correspondence between the macrocosm of the divine harmony and the microcosm of man. The order of the universe (a truth re- flected in the proportions of the human body) is susceptible to mathematical analysis: drawing on the authority of Vitruvius, Renaissance authors transformed this idea into a topos of humanist theory, alongside the multiplicity of intel- lectual currents that flowed into Neoplatonic speculation. As is well known, Michel Foucault opened Les mots et les choses with a discussion of analogical concepts. Using Foucault's terms, one might even speak of an entire discur- sive practice founded on this form of thought. To be sure, the roots of the intellectual habitus of analogism stretch back to antiquity. Pursuing distinct paths, Leo Spitzer and Henri de Lubac have demonstrated this, the first in a magisterial study of the concept of Stimmung, the second in a study of Pico that recounts the history of "man the microcosm."69 In the Hexameron of St. Ambrose the convergence of these two images in the notion of consona resultatio provides a symbol of absolute beauty and truth; in the Theodicy of Duns Scotus Erigena the moral scale has a harmonic counterpart; the con- cept of discordia concors (before being taken up by Franchino Gaffurio as the definition of harmony per se) is found in the writings of St. Augustine. Moreover, Adam's name - whose four letters in Greek seem to designate the four cardinal points of the compass - constitutes a "miniature world" identified as the human instrument with a thousand voices that, according to Clement of Alexandria, plays in harmony with God's voice.70 Isidore of Seville transmitted this idea to the Latin Middle Ages. It spans the intellectual universe of the twelfth century, as the works of Bernardus Silvestris, Hildegard of Bingen, Hugh of St. Victor, Bonaventure, and Aquinas attest. Even the Church Fathers engaged in unbiased discussion of this topos. Origen, Gregory Nazianzen, and James of Edessa inverted the analogy: "Since man is a certain kind of world," writes James, "which, given his marvelous constitution, is deemed superior to the world itself, reason urges us to recog- nize that he should be called the greater world, which is placed within the lesser."" Here macrocosm and microcosm exchange their respective referents. One can still hear echoes of this inversion in Pico's philosophy.72 By contrast, Gregory of Nyssa unleashed a torrent of invective when confronted by the same concept: Certain philosophers have made execrable assertions concerning man that are not worthy of his nobility. Convinced that they cele- brate humanity when they compare it to the world, they define man as a 'microcosm' composed of the same elements that com- prise the Universe. With this pompous name they render praise to our nature, but fail to recognize that that which contributes to the greatness of man belongs in equal measure to flies and mice ... What greatness does man acquire when he is modeled after the image of the Universe?73 Here the fourth-century theologian appears to be more of a humanist than the sixteenth-century theorists. Nonetheless, 57</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 28 an echo of his critique can be recognized in Alberti: the analogical topos has no place in De re aedificatoria. On the other hand, the comparison between man and animal ap- pears consistently in the works of the great theorist and architect (though it is, to be sure, elaborated according to an inverted scale of values).74 Evidently, the problem is more complex than has usually been admitted. In fact, the humanist attitude seems reduc- tive when compared to the richness of medieval thought on the subject. Is it conceivable that the Renaissance witnessed a step backward in this respect? We shall focus on the prin- ciple most intimately associated with what we have consid- ered so far: the analogy between architecture and music. As is well known, this analogy has Pythagorean and Platonic precedents. For this, as well, Spitzer has traced a history that betrays no significant gaps between the classical, medi- eval, and modern worlds. Consonantia and concordia discors are concepts that traverse Western culture with abso- lute continuity. Plato's harmony of the spheres is contem- plated through numerus, an order that allows access to the mystery of creation. Wittkower's approach to these themes gave him the opportunity to examine relationships between musical harmony and the mathematics of architectonic proportionality, to isolate a Palladian "fugato," to discover the mean proportions of architecture." His sources are theoretical texts, plans for the Quattro libri, philosophical and cabalistic treatises. It is no accident that Wittkower's appeal to analogism derives its validity from the famous statement by Francesco Zorzi concerning the church of San Francesco della Vigna by Sansovino.76 The author of De harmonia mundi and the Problemata is cast into a didac- tic role vis-a-vis the architects: for Wittkower, Zorzi pro- posed an edifice ordered according to harmonic laws at once cosmic and divine. Yet the microhistorical analysis undertaken in L'armonia e i conflitti revealed something quite different about the circumstances of the planning and execution of the church: that the written statement of 15 3 5 did not precede, but was in fact used to justify Sansovino's structure. Thus this text loses the centrality Wittkower as- cribed to it.77 Moreover, it can be shown that Zorzi's argu- ments are completely instrumental. His appeal to such ex- amples as the Tabernacle of Moses and the Temple of Solomon - musical and proportional sources inspired by God himself - are conventional in the extreme: Augustine refers to them in The City of God (bk. 15, 26-27); Hugh of St. Victor revived the theme. In other words, an entire theologi- cal culture interpreted the proportional mathematics of the Tabernacle and the Temple in its mystical sense. Prior to their appearance in Zorzi's text, references to the Ark and the Temple were used to validate the rebuilding program of Saint Peter's under the pontificate of Nicholas V. In addition, the chronicler of the Escorial workshop, Jos6 de Sigiienza, situ- ates the edifice erected by Philip II in a series that includes Noah's Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Temple, in complete accord with Augustine.78 The same ideal models, then, were used to justify a whole spectrum of buildings that became virtually infinite. Human- ists as well as ecclesiastics produced these legitimizing cita- tions quite frequently and a posteriori; in light of this, I should like to disclaim any approach that would deny the relationship between mystical harmony and architecture during the Renaissance. It is my purpose to stress the need to gather as much precise data as possible on this relationship and to ask how the architects conceived of it. Taken as a whole, the documentation of this problem demonstrates that the architects were not particularly interested in metaphysical speculation. All too often, when attempting to assess the cul- tural level of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century architects, their initial status - which was almost always that of artisans - is overlooked (as is their rudimentary education). In this re- spect, Alberti (like Palladio and Vincenzo Scamozzi) was exceptional. In Alberti's treatise the analogy between music and architec- ture assumes a functionalist implication. He refused to move beyond this threshold, restricting the scope of his argument to a reiteration of the conventional notion of concord. "At any rate," he writes, "we shall not pass beyond that which is of use to architecture."79 It is quite reasonable to suppose that refer- ences to musical harmony achieved the status of topoi in the Renaissance and that the allied notion of concordia discors 58</page><page sequence="14">Tafuri implied an effort to subsume multiplicity under the cat- egory of unity without suppressing it. At this point, one might ask why Alberti felt the need to desacralize Pythagorean musical doctrine (in a passage that will be examined in more detail later).80 On the face of it, it is plausible that we are not dealing with yet another instance of his customary hostility toward Florentine Neoplatonism. Deriving from the thought of Boethius and Augustine, the harmonic analogy enjoyed immense prestige throughout the medieval period. For Bonaventure, Aquinas, and Richard of Middletown, it effectively solved the riddle implied by God's refusal to improve upon his creatures. The most widespread response to this question was that in this way universal har- mony could be maintained.s' In this sense, too, a healthy soul was "symphonic," while harmony among the elements of the cosmos and those of the body, not to mention between the diverse passions of the single soul, was assimilated to the notion of concinnitas. Indeed, Bonaventure maintained that the beauty of a work derives from its intrinsic proportionality, which is to say that its origin can be found in the aequalitas numerosa the artifex discovers in his soul. In a similar vein, Aquinas delivered an encomium of proportio, asserting that it is reflected in relations between form and matter, existence and essence, species and individual. The Albertian concept of the architectural organism as animal, then, was not new per se. This notion was familiar to classical aesthetics: exte- rior (foris) and interior (intus) communicate with one an- other in the human sphere through a network of signs and reciprocal influences. Returning to Cicero's De natura deorum, in the fourth century Lactantius observed that the opifex - the supreme demiurge - pursues the dual impera- tive of beauty and utility when regulating the movements of the human body. And, to cite a final example, the celebrated florilegium edited by Gratian that went under the name of the Decretum was subtitled Concordantia discordantium canonum. 82 Yet after the condemnation of the two hundred and nineteen theses inspired by Aristotelianism (formulated in 1277), the harmonic analogy experienced a crisis. As Aquinas asserted, if God's omnipotence is not exhausted in the work of cre- ation, a "world turned upside down" is conceivable. Egidius Romanus claimed that the perfectibility of each part of the cosmos was thinkable: consequently, different harmonic systems were possible. In the same vein, the Dominican Durandus of San Porziano criticized the idea of a universal order that could be compared to a harmony expressed through mathematical proportions.83 For its part, "post-Scotist" theology - which prepared the way for notions of musica mensurabilis and the advent of theological calculationes in the fourteenth century - completely abandoned the harmonicist standpoint. In this connection, Nicholas Oresme's skepticism has even been compared to Galileo's.84 The Parisian master of the second half of the fourteenth century thoroughly distrusted man's capacity to know the proportions of any given object with precision. In a letter of 1611 Galileo stated that reality and human criteria of rationality are completely unrelated. He wrote that, given the opportunity, a man would have ordered the revolutions of the heavenly spheres differently, "according to the most rational proportional system," yet on the contrary God, without considering symmetries capable of being understood by man, has structured them according to proportions that are not only incommensurable and irrational, but totally imperceptible to our minds. It is perhaps not fortuitous that Galileo then evokes the ex- ample of architecture: If he were faced with the task of placing the vast aggregate of fixed stars within the celestial vault, our most capable architect would, I believe, distribute them in compartments so arranged as to please our sense of beauty. These would take the form of squares, hexa- gons, and octagons. Moreover, this hypothetical architect would place he largest between the mid-sized and the smallest, with proper correspondences. In this way, a beautiful proportion would arise. Yet God, seeming to use the hand of pure chance, has dispersed the stars without any order, symmetry, or elegance: or so it seems to us.8s Thus mathematical physics helps humankind orient itself in the "obscure labyrinth" of the cosmos, but does not permit insight into its implicit structure. In this, as Eugenio Garin has demonstrated, Galileo had a precursor in Francesco Patrizi da Cherso. At this point, analogical thought has noth- ing more to say. Thus an unexpected dialectic emerges 59</page><page sequence="15">assemblage 28 among the thirteenth-century calculations, Albertian skepti- cism, and Galilean science. The "scientism" of Renaissance architectural theory, how- ever, seems to play a role that can best be described as ambiguous (though, by the same token, one might call it "transitional"). To be sure, these theories (albeit in a simpli- fied and instrumental manner) recuperate ideas already beset by internal crises and on the verge of being defini- tively overwhelmed - with all the slow, torturous disorder intrinsic to this phenomenon. Thus it is clear that Wittkower's hypotheses require some correction. First, the "architectural principles" of the age of humanism were not innovative: in fact, they seem to indi- cate a theoretical regression. In a speculative sense, aperqus of this sort could give more than ample ammunition to theorists of aesthetic continuity. Yet empirical observation contradicts the appearance of seamlessness in the history we have narrated so far. The title of this book reflects the state of mind of a historian who, without bias, has tried to ac- count for all of the variables implicit to a historiographical problem that seems untimely. And, given the at time futile polemics that have attended its formulation, we would be well advised to justify the theses that have been proposed so far. Have our hypotheses of continuity and discontinuity been formulated correctly? Or, better, have we isolated phenomena and ideas capable of responding to the sort of in-depth inquiry this study is attempting? Have we not strayed too far in an idealist direction, placing too much of an accent, and too much value, on the theoretical? These doubts are not rhetorically motivated. They reflect difficul- ties intrinsic to a culture that has become all too used to disregarding theses of continuity between theory and prac- tice. Under these conditions, even the attempt to respond to the questions raised demands a new vantage point. Observations made in the preceding pages can provide a means to overcome the impasse. The antique, the concept of numerus, the anthropometric analogy, the harmonicist the- sis: all of these are part of a coherent ensemble of topoi that was employed by a system of representation in search of stable foundations. It was precisely this system that the theory of imitation subsumed as a model for the express purpose of betraying it. In practice, almost no architect referred to this distant model, which was inflected by theorists in an increas- ingly academic direction before its moment of effective disap- pearance in the baroque. When compared to the medieval era, the only element that can be called truly innovative is a crucial one: the introduction of a system that is completely representa- tional [compiutamente rappresentativo]. At stake was not the "contents," but rather, a process at once mathematically ratio- nalized and subject to verification: one permitting their for- malization within a system that "placed the world epoch in an image." The dissolution of the visionary, which Panofsky took as one result of the perspectival conceptualization of space, is closely associated with the new primacy assigned to representa- tion. Confronted by this, the disappearance of yet another paradigm - that of the symbolic universe - became inevi- table. Perhaps the space constructed by representation was the re- sult of a process of secularization whose beginnings can be traced to the art of the fourteenth century and possibly the thirteenth.86 Nonetheless, once this process achieved a cer- tain maturity, its consequence was a progressive "loss of meaning." In some sense, humanist art determined its own reception, a fact demonstrated by the ground swell of aes- thetic experimentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth cen- turies. This was implied by the reciprocity between norms and their violation, as well as the two fundamental aspects of the problem of beauty already analyzed. Thus we can uncover yet another level of meaning in aspects of Renaissance art and architecture that seem most bold, most innovative: the establishment of a code through an infinite series of exceptions. The task that Renaissance architecture (not to mention Renaissance culture) placed before itself re- sembles a fusion of extremes: the reference to solid foundations and the appeal to subjective choice. This, it has been noted, involved a complexio oppositorum, a culture of contradiction.87 Edgar Wind has interpreted the phenomenon in this manner in observing that the "rebirth of antiquity" corresponded to a type of polytheism in which each pagan deity was assimilated by the culture in all of its disquieting ambivalence.88 60</page><page sequence="16">Tafuri Appeals to the multiplicity of models went hand in hand with this type of polytheism. Here one cannot overlook the essen- tial nature of the fabula:89 from Andrea Mantegna to Giulio Romano to Nicolas Poussin, its evocation was accompanied by a recognition of the fictive and nostalgic character of the project. In more than one sense, the need to represent and the need to be represented bound artist to patron. Nevertheless, this did not take place in accordance with a coincidence of their respective intentions; rather, this particular relationship assumed an essentially dialectical character, proceeding, as it were, by extremes [per tangenze]. A variety of techniques of "reciprocal instrumentalization" between artistic style and program found new articulation with the advent of the "cul- ture of calculation." A galaxy of different forms of knowledge arose, each bent on preserving its own autonomy, each eager to undermine acquired systems of thought. As we shall see at the end of this study, ultimately, this process assumed tragic implications. Behind the scenes of this "drama," we might try to assess anew Benjamin's concept of the "decline of the aura."90 In fact, the historical circumstances that made this decline possible seem to have lasted longer and to have been more clearly articulated than we have thought up to now. Putting this delicate problem aside for the moment, we can return to questions implied by the Novella del Grasso legnaiolo, applying what we have learned so far so as to offer a plausible interpretation. As is self-evident, the ruse was planned and carried out by a group under the direction of a leader. The individual subject - the "guilty" one absent from the banquet - is set apart from the community and is thereby divested of identity. Or, better, the victim is punished by being deprived of his sense of reality. Consequently, an artificial code - the "double" self imposed on him - displaces his original natural code. Of course, this second self was constructed entirely within the limits of possibility: the craftsman was not being asked to believe that he had been transformed into a tree or a stone. The fluid boundaries between dream and reality set the con- ditions of the game. These, moreover, reflected equally shift- ing parameters dividing truth from artifice. The game, then, acquired an existential dimension. A caesura emerged in the life of the protagonist, "replicating" him. Yet the "conspirators" would have failed if not for a crucial factor: that Grasso's sanity was undermined by the stratagems laid by Brunelleschi and his cohorts. In this sense, the ruse rehearses a modern style of exist- ence. A form of conduct, planned out in advance, and oriented toward precisely defined objectives, provides its foundation. In other words, this is the same form of conduct that Castiglione proposes for the artist who projects his eidos into the unforesee- able future, or - as pointed out in a particularly persuasive manner by Elias - that of the military strategist who replaces the impulsive emotionalism of the medieval knight with a mentality at once cold and calculating.9' It has been observed, and correctly so, that Grasso is not by any means an ingenuous figure. Brunelleschi's machinations prove themselves able to overcome even the most alert. They are, in a word, ineluctable. Nonetheless, Brunelleschi's attitude can hardly be described as Faustian. The relation between the stupefying "cupola without armature" and the "waking dream" that Filippo caused Grasso to experience (the comparison is Tanturli's) is, however, indirect.92 Alberti is known to have admired the first; however, the gratu- itous, antinaturalistic character of the second is completely un-Albertian. These two concrete results of Brunelleschi's ingenium might be described, then, as a Janus bifrons: an apt figure for the moment of ethical decision implied by the techne of modernity. But Manetti's narrative strategy directly confirms one of Ernst Kantorowicz's most profound intuitions. This historian tried to delineate the precise role played by the medieval legal mental- ity in the articulation of Renaissance artistic theory, with par- ticular reference to the standardization of law according to the concept of nature.93 Immediately after asking this question, Kantorowicz pointed out that the formula normally reserved for the Pope from around 1220 onward - De nihilo facit papa aliquid sicut Deus - was originally applied to the emperor and only subsequently to poets and artists. In fact, Petrarch's coronation with laurel on the Capitol permitted him to as- sume (in Kantorowicz's eyes, at least) the plenitudo potestatis that was the prerogative of princes. Is it permissible to suggest 61</page><page sequence="17">assemblage 28 that the ruse of 1409 played a role parallel to the one ful- filled by the cupola, consecrating Brunelleschi as princeps artium? At any rate, it is clear that at the artistic threshold of the Quattrocento, we are confronted by an amoral conspiracy, a "sacrificial rite" that proclaims the triumph of a form of rationality that is calculating and relies on artifice. In Manetti's account of the affair, the victim is hemmed in by a vertiginous "hall of mirrors." Or, better still, by a studiolo composed of perspectival intarsie whose absence of win- dows onto reality provokes a perverse distortion of thought and perception. Depicted spaces of this kind (one is re- minded of the studioli at Urbino and Gubbio) are devices that allow the space of representation to invade and dis- place the space of reality.94 This process fully actualizes the humanist project. Their "terroristic" effect can be com- pared to the one unleashed by the "absent cities" portrayed in the Quattrocento perspective panels. As in the Brunelleschian ruse, the absolute nature of the technique of representation distorts and desiccates existence. With at least one crucial consequence: the analogy estab- lished between art and life under the aegis of humanism is possible when that art, that cultural project, is held in check: as a purely hypothetical horizon, its constitution decrees that is realized as a fragment. It is not necessary to further justify the implicit content of the contention that the Novella del Grasso legnaiolo serves as a "manifesto" of emerging humanist figuration. A mani- festo of peculiar persuasiveness, which, above all, precisely anticipates the effects it will have on its audiences. The ruthless retrospective analysis Grasso undergoes tends to substantiate the reactions that the entire project will pro- duce once complete. In this case, artful illusion is subject to a kind of laboratory experiment measuring the power exerted over the individual. Thus the figurative episteme is not only able to manipulate man and space. Time, too, is put to the test. The moment it is subsumed within the logic of perspective, this episteme permits the distancing required of philology. Nevertheless, it also unleashes a specific type of anxiety that arises from a desire to impede the implacable progress of Kronos.95 (Here one should compare the opportunities for "gaining time" promised by Fame.) Thus a concealed form of hybris operates behind the irenic appearances of humanism. This analysis allows us to reconsider the link Heidegger estab- lished between humanism and the will to power. We have already cited the German philosopher in reference to his expression, "world epoch placed in an image."96 It is an effective formulation, which synthesizes some of our earlier reflections linking idea, referent, and representation in the Renaissance imaginaire. But Heidegger's potent metaphor has its problematic sides. In Venezia e il Rinascimento I asked the following question: in what sense does the link established by Heidegger reflect a type of "fate"? So to speak, the subject of that book responded with skepticism.97 As I have already observed, resistances and contradictions do not represent trivial residues of a fatal pro- cess. They are productive phenomena that simultaneously condition and question this process. In this regard, the "case" of Venice was particularly illuminating: a complex intersec- tion of spatial and temporal images problematized unilinear concepts of historical understanding. In this book, these difficulties have only proliferated. This is far from surprising, given the more extensive range of its pur- view. A second "red thread" links the six chapters to come: the attempt to isolate a precise role for the forces that opposed (through distortion or deformation) the unfolding of the cul- tural thesis we have deduced from Brunelleschi's ruse. Nevertheless, it is not my task to isolate "antihumanisms"; this much will become clear by the end of this study. On the other hand, I intend to describe forms of contradiction that are held together "heroically" - to cite Daniele Barbaro - by the need for certainty and the impulse to disregard the principles of that certainty.98 This has been seen as a dialogi- cal moment.99 True enough: but more needs to be said. In perpetual dialogue, Renaissance culture was also in perpetual conflict with modes of existence, acquired mentalities, daily forms of action and comportment, imaginative structures: critical analysis of Cinquecento and Seicento architecture in Europe and America has much to teach us in this respect. 62</page><page sequence="18">Tafuri This particular conflict, however, resolved itself in a slow but sure triumphal march in appearance only. It is not the historian's task to "recombine fragments." Nor is it legitimate for him to identify with the victors - a vice that complements the apologia for present-day conditions that is, lamentably, still quite active. On the contrary, it is possible for history to lend its voice to a dialectical process that does not take the outcome of the struggles it narrates for granted. The upshot of this is that it must suspend its judgments if it is to proceed at all. Nothing is given as past. The temporal order of history is, by its constitution, hy- brid.100 This chapter has tried to outline my strategy of research, the results of which are provided in the following chapters. These propose areas of critical analysis selected for their capacity to identify the essential rhythms in the epoch under study. To be sure, these phenomena are multiple and evoke multiple critical approaches, narrative modes, and philologies. I have written this book in the hope that questions, when asked from afar, can make themselves heard without eradi- cating distance. For only when distance is preserved can the process of inquiry continue. . . . .. .. . . .. . .. . ... ..... . .. .. .. .. . . . . . . .. . . ... . . . ........ . .. .... .... ...... ....... ..... . .... ... Notes to Foreword 1. See M. Tafuri, Storia dell' architettura in Italia, 1944-85 (Turin, 1986), 230ff. Though I share some of the positions articulated by P. Rossi, Paragone degli ingegni moderni e postmodemi (Bologna, 1989), the critical object of his po- lemic is poorly focused. This flaw leads to simplifications that reduce the persuasiveness of his argument. 2. H. Sedlmayr, Verlust der Mitte (Salzburg, 1948), and idem, Der Tod des Lichtes: Obergangene Perspek- tiven zur modernen Kunst. Close analysis of the essays collected under the title Kunst und Wahrheit: Zur Theorie und Methode der Kunst- geschichte (Hamburg, 1958, and Mittewald, 1978; Italian translation, Milan, 1984) is crucial for any inter- pretation of this author. An evalua- tion of Sedlmayr's entire output has been attempted in an essay in this collection by F. P. Fiore, "Hans Sedlmayr: Veritha o metodo?" 5-20. 3. See R. Klein, "Peinture moderne et ph6nom6nologie," Critique 9 (1963): 336-53, now in La forme et I'intelligible (Paris, 1970; Italian translation, Turin, 1973), 453-73. 4. W. Benjamin, "Kleine Geschichte der Photographie," in Gesammelte Schriften (Frankfurt am Main, 1972ff.), 2: 378. 5. "It would not be hard to demon- strate that with the advent of natural- ism reference acquires forms that become more and more varied, so that its internal contradiction is in- exorably augmented. In the final analysis, this contradiction is funda- mentally epistemological and can be compared to the aporia of the objects of consciousness. Can we affirm a nonfigurative criterion beyond the image, a telos of figuration against which the image can be measured? Sooner or later, one has to bring ref- erence down to the work itself; only then can one complete the process with a form of thought that installs outside of itself a subject and an ob- ject - a thought whose 'final word' (already uncertain of itself by virtue of its initial premises) was psychologism in philosophy and impressionism in art. After bracketing all inaccessible realities, we reach the simple descrip- tion of intentional structures of per- ception and acts of consciousness in general, which is to say, we have come up to the point of a Husserl, a Cezanne" (Klein, "Peinture moderne et phenomenologie," 455). If one di- vests Klein's thought of its phenom- enological envelope, one can grasp his point by observing that contempo- rary art eliminates all illusions con- cerning the representability of that which cannot be represented: an open path toward a nonsecularized conception of the latter. 6. See, for instance, V. Gregotti, "Per il metodo," Casabella 54, no. 569 (1990): 2-3; idem, "Condizioni," Casabella 54, no. 571 (1990): 2-3; idem, "Confini invalicabili," Casabella 54, no. 577 (1991): 2-3; idem, Dentro l'architettura (Turin, 1991); and B. Secchi, Progetto per l'urbanistica (Turin, 1989). 7. Such a quality in contemporary art has been grasped with formidable intuition by Massimo Cacciari, who illustrates his interpretation by recog- nizing a conversation "in the most extraordinary silence of the soul" between the Sleeping Nymph of Constantin Brancusi and the Black Cross of Kasimir Malevich. (Both of these were part of an exhibition at the Centre Beaubourg in Paris). See M. Cacciari, Dell'Inizio (Milan, 1990), 447-49. 8. I still maintain the theses already outlined in M.

A critical edition of the Novella, by Domenico de Robertis, with in- troduction and notes by Giuliano Tanturli, can be found in A. Manetti, Vita di Filippo Brunel- leschi preceduta da La Novella del Grasso (Milan, 1976). A new ver- sion, prepared by Bernardo Giambullari and Bartolomeo Davanzati and based on Codices Palatino 51 and 200, is in Antonio Lanza's edition (Florence, 1989). This version has been reedited by Paolo Procaccioli as La Novella del Grasso legnaiolo, with a preface by G. Manganelli, Palatino 200, vulgate (Parma, 1990).

"Consider the human figure, which can be called a miniature world: one in which every bodily member is constructed by art, rather than caprice; which, as a whole, is an image of beauty. Thus it is diffi- cult to say whether it lends more grace or utility to the human face and the other parts of the body ... What does a ship need, if not prow, hull, lateens, mast, sails, rudder, oars, anchor, and rigging? Yet all these things are beautiful, so that anyone who beholds them can dis- cover as much beauty as usefulness" (Castiglione, II libro del Cortegiano, bk. 4, chap. 58, 436). It is worth not- ing that Castiglione proceeds to cite an example of his own architectural thought: "Columns and architraves support high loggias and palaces, yet are no less beautiful to behold than they are useful for the edifice." On this theme, see as well Bazzotti and Belluzzi, "Le concezioni estetiche," 118. 23. Ibid., 17. 24. Castiglione, II libro del Cortegiano, bk. 1, chap. 26, 59.

It is well known that Politian, too, took up the theme of multiple models in his debate with Paolo Cortesi. See J.

Besides being friendly with Castiglione, Lodovico di Canossa, Bishop of Bayeux, was also close to Pietro Bembo and Giovanni Matteo Giberti. From 1518 until his departure for France, he was Leo X's personal confessor. Patron of the Madonna of the Pearl, in May 1519 he brought Raphael's design for Francesco Gonzaga's funerary monument to Mantua. It has been suggested that the faqade of his Veronese palace is based on a design by Giulio Romano. See H. Burns in Giulio Romano, 510. 32.

In the Cortegiano, Giuliano de' Medici is the proponent of the theory of musical dissonance, which is adduced as another in- stance of sprezzatura: "the second is allowed, as is the seventh, which is, when taken in itself, a harsh, even intolerable dissonance; yet, when resolved within the context of a per- fect harmony, arouses satisfaction" (ibid., bk. 1, chap. 28, 62-63). Moreover, in painting "lines are not conspicuously displayed, and brush strokes are performed without su- perfluous effort, so that it seems that the hand, without being guided by study or art, realizes its aims sponta- neously, in conformity with the painter's intentions; thus sprezza- tura reveals his talent so all who see it use their own judgment to form an opinion of it" (ibid., 64). 39. A. Labacco, Libro di Antonio Labacco appartenente a l'archi- tettura (1552; Rome, 1559), 17-18. Labacco praises "beautiful temples with mixed orders, which seem to utilize the Doric in metopes and triglyphs while using square models for the cornice and elongated and well-cut capitals. In addition, the columns are fluted in the Compos- ite style. In all of this, moreover, ev- erything is in its place. The entire effect is extremely pleasing to the beholder because the whole differs from any of the other orders. Bramante often followed this pro- cedure in his architecture, as can be readily observed. He liked this practice because of its novelty." Bramante's curiosity extended to early Christian and Byzantine architecture as well, as Franz Metternich, Christoph Frommel, and Peter Murray have pointed out. Thus it is likely that the plan for the choir of Saint Peter's owes some- thing to San Vitale in Ravenna. That a relationship exists between the Genazzano Nymphaeum and the ground plan of Hagia Sophia (the architect could have familiar- ized himself with this plan through a drawing in Giuliano da Sangallo's Libro) has been suggested by C. L. Frommel, "Bramantes 'Ninfeo' in Genazzano," Romische Jahrbuch fur Kunstgeschichte 12 (1969): 137-60. 40. Though some of his conclu- sions seem dated, Bruschi's analysis of Bramante's vocabulary is still rel- evant. See A. Bruschi, Bramante architetto (Bari, 1969); idem, Bramante (Rome-Bari, 1973); and idem, "Bramante, Raffaello e Palladio," Bollettino C.I.S.A. 11 (1973): 67-87. Cf. F. W.

Revision of the historiographic thesis of manner- ism was initiated with the interven- tions of Wolfgang Lotz, Craig Hugh Smyth, and John Shearman at the 20th International Congress in the History of Art, New York, 1961.

Wurm, Baldassarre Peruzzi, Architekturzeichnungen: Tafelband (Ttibingen, 1984), 221, 229, 231, 233. The triangular but- tresses supporting the sail vault of the nave that appears in the Peruzzi drawing recall those of the Duomo of Siena's faqade (compare the polystyle articulation that sepa- rates the portals). For another quo- tation of Sienese elements, see the Peruzzian exterior (which was, however, executed by Jacopo Ranuzzi) of the Ghislardi Chapel attached to the Church of San Domenico in Bologna. The ele- ment derives its vault from the chapel fronting the piazza (which was added by Antonio Federighi). But cf. the British Museum draw- ing for the faqade of the chapel of San Giovanni in the Siena cathe- dral. See C. L. Frommel, "Serlio e la scuola romana," in C. Thoenes, ed., Sebastiano Serlio (Milan, 1989), 39ff., esp. 42. 47. It is not fortuitous that certain republican traditions - those asso- ciated with Siena, Venice, and Flo- rence - appeal to a habitus and an architectural language considered "native" or peculiar to a specific place. For instance, it is well known that Alexander VII Chigi promoted the Gothic in Siena at the height of the seventeenth century. Nonethe- less, it is not necessary to interpret such regionalism as a sign of spe- cific political positions in the output of a Peruzzi or a Sansovino, even if the latter expressed, in Venice, his preference for the "liberty of a re- public" as opposed to the tyranny of princes. On Michelangelo's political position - one fraught with ambi- guity - see G. Spini, "Politica di Michelangelo," in Atti del Convegno di Studi Michelangioleschi (Flo- rence-Rome, 1966), 110-70. The theme of consuetudo was appropri- ated by Vincenzo Scamozzi, as well, in the context of this own theoreti- cal syncretism. He asserts that it is necessary to take national as well as regional architectural traditions into account because "one has recourse to different ways of building in Spain, France, Germany, and Italy. So, too, do ways of building differ in the different cities of Italy, in Rome, Venice, Genoa, and Milan - as in many other places." 48. C.

To be sure, Blondel does pronounce a positive judgment on the Gothic and tries to reconcile evolutionist ideas with a concept of aesthetic normativity. See F.

L. Scalvini and S. Villari, preface to C. Perrault, L'ordine dell'architettura (Palermo, 1991), 31. The limits of Perrault's architectural knowledge are manifest in his justification of paired columns exemplified by the Louvre's east faqade. "The taste of our century, or at least of our nation, differs from that of the ancients; moreover, it is probable that there is something of the Gothic in it. This is because we have air, light, and a certain natural repose. This has led us to invent a sixth manner of ar- ranging columns, which is the method of pairing." This is, in fact, a response to specific criticisms articu- lated by Blondel. Perrault, however, ignored the precedents set by 66</page><page sequence="22">Tafuri Francesco di Giorgio, Peruzzi, and Borromini. 51. C. Perrault, Parallle des anciens et des modernes, en ce qui regarde les arts et la science (Paris, 1699-97). See Kruft, Geschichte der Architekturtheorie, 170-71. In a more general sense, see P. Hazard, La Crise de la conscience europdene (1680-1785) (Paris, 1935; Italian translation, Milan, 1968). 52. See Perrault, Ordonnance, xiv: the architectural orders, assimilated to inexplicable objects, "have no origin distinct from the accidents or caprices of an artisan who has not taken the trouble to investigate the cause or determinate reason of a thing, and whose precision simply does not matter." 53. Perrault, Les Dix Livres, 105 n. 17. According to Antoine Picon, the conceptual pair positive beauty/ arbitrary beauty evokes the distinc- tion established by Jean-Louis de Cordemoy between "signes naturels" and "signes d'institution." A similar distinction can be found in the Logique du Port Royal. 54. C. Wren, "Tract 1" in Parentalia (London, 1750), 352. Summerson refers to the "tyranny of intellect" when speaking of the Royal Society, of which Wren was a member. "An Architect," wrote Wren, "ought to be jealous of Novelties in wich [sic] Fancy blinds the Judgement" (ibid.). See J. Summerson, "The Tyranny of Intellect: A Study of the Mind of Sir Christopher Wren in Relation to the Thought of His Time," R.I.B.A. Jour- nal 44, no. 8 (1937): 373-90. It is al- most certain that Wren knew both Claude Perrault and Roland Freart de Chambray. The second part of "Tract 1" seems to have been edited after 1708 (the date of the John Jones translation of Perrault). 55. L. B. Alberti, De re aedificatoria, bk. 9, pt. 5; ed. G.

"The ancients thought it acceptable to mix the Rustic not only with the Doric, but also with the Ionic and Corinthian orders: the reason being that it is not an error if one starts with a single style and then proceeds to create a mixture [mescolanza] of all of them. This hy- brid is partly the work of nature and partly the work of the artist." 57. On these themes, see, among other contributions, M. R. Huber, "Sebastiano Serlio: Sur une archi- tecture civile, 'alla parisiana,"' L'Information d'histoire d'art 9 (1965): 9-17; M. Rosci, Il trattato d'architettura di Sebastiano Serlio (Milan, 1966); M.

Esposito, Ordine e conflitto: Machiavelli e la letteratura politica del Rinascimento italiano (Naples, 1984), 97ff. As Esposito observes, Castiglione identifies technique with behavior with a particular pur- pose; this, however, is not opposed to "idea." Indeed, technique is the means by which the "idea" mani- fests itself in its tendency to lend or- der to change and to master the negative (e.g., death, loss). 65. See, for instance, the guiding premise of the valuable collection of essays edited by Jean-Claude Maire-Vigueur and Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, Ars e Ratio: Dalla torre di Babele al ponte di Rialto (Palermo, 1990), 11-13.

It is still necessary to emphasize that Renaissance artistic theory was extra- neous to strictly hermetic or cabalis- tic strains of thought. The latter postulates a transcendence of the limits of language: its concept of numerus is identified with the con- 67</page><page sequence="23">assemblage 28 cept of architectural abstraction only by forcing the argument. On the semantics of hermetic thought, see the brilliant pages by U. Eco, I limiti dell'interpretazione (Milan, 1990), 71ff. 78. On the description of Saint Pe- ters as Nicholas V intended it to be, in the text of Giannozzo Manetti, see C. W. Westfall, In this Most Perfect Paradise (University Park, 1972; Italian translation, Rome, 1984), 221ff. Westfall observes that Manetti, in 1436, while describing Santa Maria del Fiore, cites the analogy of the human body and the perfect construction of Noah's Ark. See G. Manetti, De saecularibus et pontificulaibus pompis, ed. E. Battisti, in Umanesimo e esoterismo: Atti del V Convegno Internazionale di Studi Umanistici, ed. E. Castelli (Padua, 1960), 310-20. In this con- nection, patristic tradition is also cited in De re aedificatoria, bk. 9, pt. 7. On the iconography of the Escorial and the text of Jose de Sigtienza, see G. von der Osten Sacken, El Escorial: Estudio iconologico (Madrid, 1984), and G. Kubler, La obra del Escorial (Madrid, 1983), 173-77. See also the articulate critique of a magical/ hermetic interpretation of the edi- fice commissioned by Philip II and designed by Juan de Herrera in R. Taylor, "Architecture and Magic: Considerations on the Idea of the Escorial," in Essays in the History of Architecture Presented to Rudolf Wittkower (New York, 1967), 81-109. 79. "The very same numbers," Alberti observes, "that cause sound to have that concinnitas, pleasing to the ears, can also fill the eyes and mind with wondrous delight. From musicians therefore, who have al- ready examined such numbers thor- oughly, or from those objects in which Nature has displayed some evident and noble quality, the whole method of outlining (delimitazione) is derived. But I shall dwell on this topic no longer than is relevant to the business of the architect" (L. B. Alberti, On the Art of Building in Ten Books, trans. J. Rykwert, N. Leach, and R. Tavernor [London, 1989], 305). Music, then, is simply considered able to yield familiar proportions. In general, emphasis on musical- architectural analogy in sixteenth- century theory can be explained as an attempt to invest the latter with socially elevated associations. Since antiquity music formed a crucial part of the arts of the quadrivium. 80. See chap. 2 of Ricerca del Rinascimento. 81. On these themes, in addition to Spitzer, Classical and Christian Ideas, see H. Schavernoch, Die Harmonie der Sphaeren (Freiburg- Munich, 1981); U. Eco, Arte e bellezza nell'estetica medievale (Milan, 1987); and L. Bianchi and E. Randi, Le verita dissonanti: Aristotele alla fine del Medioevo (Rome-Bari, 1990), 151ff. A highly original reading of "harmonicist" and analogist theories has been car- ried out by J.-C. Schmitt, La Raison des gestes dans l'Occident me'die'vale (Paris, 1990; Italian translation, Rome-Bari, 1990). 82. Bianchi and Randi, Le veritha dissonanti, 63. 83. Ibid., 173-76. 84. Ibid., 143-50. 85. Galileo, Opere (Florence, 1929ff.), bk. 11, 149-50. See Bianchi and Randi, Le veritah dissonanti, 146. Though he does not cite Galileo's letter, Robert Klein elucidates the dialectic between hu- manism and the new science. For Klein, humanism aspired "to an imaginable 'model' of the cosmos. The analogy between microcosm and macrocosm, the closed, hierar- chical system, the magical and sym- bolic correspondences between astral and sublunar worlds, the forces of the soul and the creation of eternal myths, geometrical and mu- sical harmony governing the physi- cal universe and impressing its law on sensible and supersensible beauty - all of this constitutes a world that is 'reactionary' vis-a-vis the sciences and overcome at every turn by experience, but that still ir- resistibly held sway over the arts and found itself reflected in music and in architecture . . . All the same, if humanism falls outside of this evo- lutionary process, it does not so much because of its self-enclosed character as its unrestrained ten- dency to visualization, to its con- crete, non-relational, form" (R. Klein, La Forme et l'intelligible [Paris, 1970; Italian translation, Turin, 1975], 366). 86. On this theme, see the pene- trating analysis of G. Marramao, Potere e secolarizzazione: Le categorie del tempo (Rome, 1983). For his part, Foucault observes that "the theory of representation disap- pears as a general foundation of all possible orders;... a profound his- toricity penetrates to the heart of things, isolating and defining them in their coherences, imposing forms of order on them that are im- plicit to the continuity of time" (M. Foucault, Les Mots et les choses [Paris, 1966; Italian translation, Milan, 1967], 13). On the process that, at the close of the medieval period, led to a decline of the sym- bolic in favor of representation, see the outstanding study by C. Frugoni, Una lontana citta: Sentimenti e immagini nel Medioevo (Turin, 1983). 87. See L. Batkin, Gli umanisti italiani: Stile di vita e di pensiero (Moscow, 1978; Italian translation, Rome-Bari, 1990), 166ff. This is, of course, a theme of exceptional im- port that consistently occupied Aby Warburg. 88. E.
