<plain_text><page sequence="1">Masaryk's Idea of Democracy R. SZPORLUK During the 1890s Masaryk's views on politics underwent a change. Although he had previously regarded all political action as futile and often harmful, he now became a Reichsrat deputy. He recognised the importance of social and economic reforms, of which he had been scornful a few years before. In 1876 an article of his on 'Plato as a patriot' had commended the rule of the philosophers. Now he spoke of democracy as a desirable form of government. The ideas which he expressed in 1876 were not however a practical programme or recommendations. These were to be found in his book on 'Suicide' which appeared five years later. It was essential, Masaryk wrote, to overcome the crisis of modern civilisation, which was a mass tendency to suicide, sustained by non-political factors. Though the 'crisis' might occur under any form of government, it assumed parti? cularly dangerous forms in countries where the 'new ideas' of demo? cracy and liberty prevailed. These countries, in Masaryk's view, were Protestant: in Catholic countries the influence of an authoritarian religion prevented the masses from becoming its victim. The only road to improvement lay through the moral renovation of the individual and the advent of a new religion, compatible with the modern age and based on belief in God and the immortality of the soul. All other approaches, including the political, were useless. Given these opinions, it may be asked what precisely Masaryk meant when he began soon afterwards to speak approvingly of demo? cracy. A reading of his works leads to the conclusion that he came to use 'democracy' as a synonym for 'the good state'. It could be argued that democracy (as then understood) had no more than a negative claim to his allegiance, in that in practical politics it was opposed to the Catholic, monarchist, and feudal state. As an ideal, as the 'good state', he envisaged something different; and it may be worth attempting to reconstruct this ideal by following up thoughts whose full expression was inhibited by unpropitious circumstances. It is perhaps not unjust to suggest that historical circumstances rather than Masaryk's own unshakeable convictions prevented him from developing his 'Platonist' ideas on what made a government good. Neither in the Habsburg monarchy, where his main enemies were the aristocratic and bureaucratic state and the established church, nor in Czechoslovakia, where he became the new state's first presi? dent, did existing conditions encourage him to develop the theme of his youth. Thus his critique of, and opposition to, the reactionary</page><page sequence="2">32 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW monarchy overshadowed his distrust of popular government and also prevented a full and free statement of his beliefs. In his criticism of Austria and his study of Russia, Masaryk did not hesitate to side with democracy. But, while he favoured democracy as a practical alterna? tive to the existing regimes, he did not regard it as the best form of government. II Masaryk's thinking on history was closely connected with the concept which he had formed of the mutual relationship between religion, myth, and science, on the one hand, and political problems and, in particular, democracy, on the other. His impulse to acknow? ledge the existence and acuteness of social and political problems derived directly from the pressure of 'reality'; but his ideas about them were formulated between 1891 and 1914 in terms of his earlier views. His study of 'reality', that is, of contemporary developments in Austria, Germany and Russia, had convinced him of the inevitably victorious march of democracy. He felt it necessary to analyse and interpret this and draw conclusions in line with his own long-accepted assumptions. For Masaryk history had always been a struggle be? tween belief and unbelief; religion was the essential factor in the life of both the individual and society; a new religion was the need of the times. But how were democracy, parliamentarianism, social move? ments, radicalism and revolution to be fitted into this essential pattern of history? An answer was provided in Russland und Europa, written over a period of years and published in 1913. Masaryk saw that Austria and Russia were the states most deeply torn by internal conflicts. In his search for the explanation he did not go far: their religions were theocratic and unscientific; through their close connection. Catholicism1 imparted to the state its own reac? tionary character. Masaryk's starting pointed remained the same: In my attempts at philosophico-historical explanations I start from the conviction that religion constitutes the central and centralizing mental force in life of the individual and of society. . . . The content of history is the peculiar struggle of the critical understanding with myth, the struggle between critical and scientific thought on the one hand and mythology on the other.2 1 To make his scheme work Masaryk also gave this name to Eastern Orthodoxy. 2 T. G. Masaryk, The Spirit of Russia, two vols., London, 1955, II, pp. 557-558. But Masaryk warned against interpretations which would identify all religion with mythology: '. . . the crowning task of the present is to create the religion and the religious organization of society that will be in conformity with the demands of the critical understanding . . . Comte's idea, the view of those liberals, socialists, and anarchists who are hostile to religion, that the modern epoch constitutes a higher non-religious stage of development, is erroneous.* {Ibid., II, pp. 558-559.)</page><page sequence="3">masaryk's idea of democracy 33 This struggle was not only philosophical and theological; it was also a political struggle between absolute monarchy and democracy.3 Just as philosophy was 'absolutely opposed' to theology and 'anthropism' to theism, so in the political sphere democracy was opposed to theocracy and theocratic aristocracy.4 'Belief in divine revelation, belief in God, has ever been, and is of necessity, belief in mediators between God and man, bellefin priests. This belief, this faith, created the church, created theocracy.'5 Masaryk found the basic difference between theocracy and demo? cracy in what he called the solution of the problem of authority: 'aristocracy derives its supreme authority from religion, from God, from revelation'. Democracy also appealed to an authority: 'to the people, to humanity, to the masses, to civilization, progress, historical development and so on'.6 The foundation of democracy was 'atheocracy, practically anti-theocracy ... we might call demo? cracy . . . anthropocracy'.7 It is from belief in God that the evils essential to theocracy follow. They are inequality (regarded by the theocrats as 'natural and historically necessary')8 and relationships of domination and subordi? nation between a minority of rulers and a majority of subjects. Aristo? cracy in the political sphere was intimately connected with ecclesiastical aristocracy. It was social organisation based on power: the non-workers ruled over the workers. It was also characterised by myth, by the absence of science: 'theocracy had no science, but only esotericism, mysteries, and prophecies'; no researchers but augurs.9 To aristocratic inequality Masaryk counterposed democratic equality, which 'implies fraternal and voluntary co-operation'; the aim of democracy was to abolish 'a relationship of subjection and rule'.10 Society would no longer be divided between rulers (non- workers) and ruled (workers). In a democracy all would work: 'democracy allots and organises labour'. Democracy moreover meant 'the spirit of industry': the disinclination of those who had to perform tasks not of their own choosing would be overcome by 'the sentiment 3 Ibid., II, p. 221. 4 Ibid., I, p. 213. 5 Ibid., I, p. 209. 'Christianity was responsible for the fuller development of theocracy and for the completion of the union between church and state. Indeed, the very concept of theocracy originated in the Christian notion of religion. . . . Revealed religion is of necessity a religious and priestly aristocracy; and as such, it is the foundation and the prototype of socio-political aristocracy.'

It was only bellefin God which, gradually, step by step, led some men to seek power and privilege at the expense of others. In Masaryk's view nothing else was sufficiently important to produce in men different, and sometimes conflicting, interests and aspirations which they sought to further by political methods. Masaryk's assumption that human interests and aims are not only ultimately reconcilable but really in harmony explains his statement that the purpose of democracy is to abolish all government. Demo? cracy aimed 'at administration, at the administration of the people, by the people, for the people'. How to realise this postulate in practice was a difficult problem of administrative technique, not a question of power.13 Thus the abolition of theocratic religion would be followed by a withering away of politics; what would remain would be a functional, technical problem. In practice this presumably meant that all problems would have to be regarded as administrative and consequently left to the discretion of administrators of appropriate rank. A direct democracy was impossible, and Masaryk produced only one alternative. 'As, in actual working', he wrote, 'aristocratic monarchy was always an oligarchy, so also is democracy in actual working an oligarchy.'14 The nature of social organisation itself, 'the mechanics and technique of social living, co-existence', were the causes of oligarchy in democracy.15 The meaning of 'democratic equality' consisted in the admission that all kinds and forms of labour deserved recognition as useful for the community.16 The opposition between aristocratic inequality and democratic equality lay in the fact that theocracy contained non- workers and that only they ruled; democracy meant the direction of the deposed non-workers to useful work and not, as might have been expected, the rule of the people. While Masaryk refused to acknow? ledge the functions performed by theocratic oligarchs as work, he ll Ibid., II, p. 509. ?Ibid., II, p. 510. 13 Ibid., II, p. 507. 14 Ibid., II, p. 508. In passing, Masaryk proposed to prevent democracy from turning into an aristocratic oligarchy by means of a 'mutualist federation of organizations'. 15 Nesndze demokracie, p. 6. Frantisek Fajfr, in 'Masarykova filosone demokracie' {Masarykuv Sbornik, I, 3, 1924, Prague, 1924, p. 217), observed: * [Masaryk] does not carry this idea further; but were the mechanics and technique of social coexistence necessarily, ipso facto, aristocratic and oligarchic, it would mean that democracy could not be realised and that for purely technical reasons society could not be organised democra tically.' 16 Nesndze demokracie, p. io.</page><page sequence="5">MASARYK S IDEA OF DEMOCRACY 35 recognised 'democratic oligarchs' as workers. This recognition was due to the knowledge, competence, and efficiency of the new oligarchs; theocrats by contrast were ignorant and lazy. By reason of their professional qualities the democratic oligarchs were also likely to exercise a power far greater than that which in practice the theo? crats had ever been able to acquire. III If theocracy had its foundation in God, what was the foundation of democracy? It appealed (to use Masaryk's expressions) to the author? ity of the people, humanity, the masses, etc. But these 'objective authorities' had themselves to be furnished with foundations.17 Rousseau, Masaryk continued, had occupied himself with the problem of the real will of the people and knew that catholicity, universality and unity did not exclude the possibility of error. He had striven to determine the characteristics of the genuine will of the people, which he considered infallible and absolute. Masaryk held that 'every reflective person who abandons myth, and who with Kant explains all knowledge as derivable from the natural faculties of man', was in a similar situation. But the questions which Masaryk asked were different questions: what is the critical, scientific thinker forced to recognise as supreme, what authority is for him vested in the people, in humanity, in the parliamentary majority? 'The critical thinker', he replied, 'can recognise nothing but the so-called inner authority.' Masaryk did not try to analyse the categorical imperative when he spoke of the difficulty to which its acceptance led.18 All that need be said, he explained, is that the democratic principle of authority is purely ethical. The sovereignty of the people must not be conceived in the sense of the monarchical sovereignty of absolutism. Democratic catholicity does not rest solely on the arithmetic of universal or pre? ponderant opinion.19 Masaryk's way of speaking does not suggest that he was concerned with the protection of individuals against the curtailment of, or interference with, some of their rights by a demo? cratic, but oppressive majority. He had a rather different purpose in mind when he defined democracy as something other than merely the rule of all, that is, in practice, of the majority. What he seems to have wanted to justify and to call democratic was rule by a minority, free from responsibility to, or control by, the whole body of citizens ('all'). 17 The Spirit of Russia, II, p. 516. 18 'Kant posited in his categorical imperative an infallible, ethical authority; but this authority is subjective and individual, even though it proclaims itself universal as well as necessary.' Ibid. 19 Ibid., II, p. 517.</page><page sequence="6">36 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW It will be recalled that Masaryk opposed God to men, myth to science, theocracy to democracy, and that he also assumed a natural harmony between men and conceived democratic government as administration, that is as a field of activity subject to management by technicians, by professionals. If democracy thus conceived was to function properly, it presupposed by its very nature administration by the most knowledgeable men of the community. But, given things as they were, it had to be assumed that the masses would remain to a large extent under the influence of myth.20 If democracy involved the right of all to decide about policy, a democracy might fail in these circumstances to listen to the voice of those who knew the truth and thus transform itself in reality into a 'mythopoeic' theocracy. For this reason what mattered was not who or how many decided, or by what method. The essential was what they decided, and whether it was right or wrong. This did not depend on numbers. In his awareness of these dangers Masaryk repeated insistently that democracy was something other than merely the rule of 'all': demo? cratic 'catholicity' ought not to be equated with the prevalent or universal opinion. The point was essential, since democracy had to decide not only questions of administration but equally important questions of ends and aims, to the achievement of which the work of all ought to be directed. It was Masaryk's contention that scientific method and judgment could be applied in the making of these decisions as well as in their execution. I came to the conclusion that to be a conscientious democrat means to think philosophically, then to take into account the teaching of history, to be able to understand evolution?the philosophy of history . . . scientific history and the philosophy of history reveal to the modern politician, through the idea of progress, a direction; it gives him guidance, and shows the life of society in historical perspective. Since the eighteenth century, particularly since the Great Revolution, history and the philosophy of history are indispensable arms of politics. Naturally the problem of the Weltanschauung based on history is in modern philosophy the foremost one: every individual strives to find and to prove his own place in the historical process.21 This meant, Masaryk concluded, that men had to carry on their politics with a full, clear knowledge. 'Democracy is a Weltanschauung and a way of life'; it is the political consequence and requirement of modern humanitarian ethics.22 Consequently it needed a science to which people could go for help. This science was modern philosophy, for 'scientific anthropism naturally asserted its validity in the ethical 20 T. G.

Philosophy aimed 'at the foundation of a new morality, at the elaboration of the new democratic political and administrative system, at anthropocratic democracy'.23 A new system of politics needed to be built on scientific sociology and other 'abstract sciences'. To it Masaryk's saying about politics in general would apply with special force: they are 'based upon morality; it is the function of politics to elucidate and to realise ethical principles on behalf of and in the social whole'.24 Naturally the realities of political life did not yet fully conform to the ideal. The influences of old 'theocratism' made themselves felt in parliaments which paid insufficient attention to the voice of experts in politics. In the absence of these experts 'parliament with its plenary sessions easily becomes a stage for demagogues and political actors'.25 The need for professional political knowledge and talented leaders led Masaryk to observe: 'Democracy does not mean merely the rule of the mass, but also a definite Life and World-Outlook.... In essence we always come back to Plato and his dilemma about kings and philosophers.'26 IV Politics was a science among other sciences. It was also a separate profession. Masaryk believed in the existence of a distinct, political talent as a fact which could not be denied even by noisy adherence to democracy (kein larmender Demokratismus). He explained that he was not speaking of the general or special professional education of deputies: it was obvious that a deputy not acquainted with education or taxes could not decide about them. 'But school, taxes, railways, etc. it is still not politics.'27 Masaryk also quoted and rejected 'the doctrine of Communism' that 'all the more important decisions ought to express the judgment and will of all, of the whole mass'. This implied that however different men might be they would become equally capable of understanding and judging, which all the available evidence denied. The scientific, expert nature of politics would always keep it a closed domain for the majority of men since the growth of knowledge among the masses could never match the development of science, which would always remain above the understanding of the majority. Politics was a discipline and, like other disciplines, it required would-be practitioners to have both special talents, which are inborn, and special education, which can best be acquired by 23 The Spirit of Russia, II, p. 511. 24 Ibid., II, p. 467. 25 Nesndze demokracie, pp. 11-12. 26 Ibid., pp. 41-42. 27 T.

This made it inevitable that only a few men would be successful in acquiring a mastery of politics. It was precisely because of the scientific character of politics that Masaryk was to insist that equality was impossible. No raising of all or of most to any 'minimum' level would satisfy him that the com? munity could be allowed to decide for itself. Therefore he did not welcome 'any extension of franchise without regard for quality'.28 If neither birth nor a restricted franchise can ensure political knowledge and art, a very wide or universal franchise will not do so either.29 No design or will of the whole of the community could guarantee scien? tific certainty. ... no mass of people, however large, guarantees by itself truth and certainty; besides, no mass is able to think; only individuals can think (be it also for the mass) and they have done it in private, in solitude, in the desert. Not merely psychology but logic and epistemology, all the develop? ment of science and philosophy, bore witness against the absolute equality postulated by Marx and Engels.30 Masaryk rejected their view emphatically. He believed himself that outstanding individuals always exercised a great influence in all fields, including politics. They had exercised it in the past, were exercising it now, and would exer? cise it in future. Moreover, in Masaryk's view their influence was decisive.31 The origin of social inequality was to be sought, Masaryk sugges? ted,32 in the natural inequality of men. The inequality of men's minds, feelings, and wills, their talents and needs, and their position in nature and society, led to a society which was built hierarchically. The inequality of men was demonstrated in politics by the fact that their natures inclined some of them to seek power and others to subordinate themselves and obey. This tendency to obedience was also staatenbildend.33 There are psychological restrictions of equality, there is an abundant thirst for power (domineering nature) but also sufficiently widespread 28 Ibid., p. 191. 29 Ibid., p. 578. 30 Ibid., p. 191. I am not here concerned as to whether Masaryk had correctly under? stood Marx and Engels. 81 Ibid., p. 194 32 In so doing he ignored a warning by Rousseau in the 'Origin of Inequality': 'It is useless to ask what is the source of natural inequality, because that question is answered by the simple definition of the word. Again, it is still more useless to inquire whether there is any essential connection between the two inequalities; for this would be only asking, in other words, whether those who command are necessarily better than those who obey . . .; a question fit perhaps to be discussed by slaves in the hearing of their masters, but highly unbecoming to reasonable and free men in search of the truth.'

Indifference and passivity as well as intellectual and educational in? equality contributed to the growth of oligarchy and aristocracy.34 Masaryk had no wish to deny that the social organisation was not 'perfect', that it often resulted in oppression. But it followed from this that the imperfections needed to be removed. Instead, what Marx and Engels did, 'as usual', was to throw the baby away with the bath? water.35 The masses, however, had and would continue to have considerable power. This raised the practical problem ('an extremely old prob? lem!'): 'How could that power be combined organically with logic, with knowledge?'36 When considering universal suffrage, Masaryk admitted that a greater number of men would probably throw up more 'politically thinking' men. The problem was to secure these 'politically thinking' men a lasting, not an accidental and temporary, political influence. Modern politics is not exhausted with the democratisation of the State. It has yet another task, which is no less important?to make out of politics a practical science and a practical art founded on science; along with the democratisation to organise and safeguard the social influence of special and political knowledge. . . . The problem is to guarantee organically the social influence of political experts.37 About this problem, which was the main problem of a truly scientific and philosophic politics, the Marxist leaders had thought little.38 In spite of its cult of science, Marxism had in practice recognised consti? tutional parliamentarianism:39 Engels wanted to use constitutional parliamentarianism as a way to political power, while his successors thought about improving it. But Marxism found an obstacle to its efforts in its own uncritical, I will say frankly, superstitious concept of the masses. Though Marx and Engels were opponents of anthropomorphism and mysticism they have not kept themselves completely free of them in politics. Their uncritical, inarticulate, anthropomorphist concept of 'the mass' leads them to democratic superstition.40 Masaryk claimed that he did not himself share the superstition of 'great numbers' and 'great actions'. This was not because of a leaning 34 Nesndze demokracie, p. 6. 35 Die philosophischen . . . Grundlagen, p. 406. 36 Ibid., p. 191. 3? Ibid., p. 578. 38 Ibid., p. 578. ?

'And the numerous socialist, democratic, popular?and aristocratic?demagogues are to me quite repulsive', he wrote. This did not mean that one could and should not learn from the working people of country and town: only that the people should not be made an idol?and a milch-cow.41 Masaryk also formulated another problem which seemed to him of great importance: 'How to guarantee to the educated expert, to the individual of talent and of genius, influence on the views and opinions of the masses ... in all spheres and particularly in politics?'42 But he never explained how his plan for scientific politics could be im? plemented. Modern parliamentarianism seemed to be in the ascen? dant, and his nearest approach to a practical suggestion was his recommendation that in the interest of the whole guarantees should be introduced that the rights and opinions of minorities, including expert individuals, would always be taken into account.43 As Masaryk's conclusions could not be implemented in any prac? tical manner, his statements tended to appear merely as a moralist's harmless appeal to the world, calling on men to be just, good and honest not only at home but at the office and in the parliamentary chamber.44 But if they are linked with some of his later ideas and actions they appear in a different light. In order to give substance to his philosophy of democracy reference will therefore be made to a few of the occasions when he thought that his 'scientific' principles had been put into practice. V The decision which Masaryk took in 1914 to go abroad and work for the destruction of Austria and the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia was bold and revolutionary, especially as the last pre-war election had given him only two per cent of the votes and no representative of the major Czech parties approved of his action. The fact that his party was the smallest party in the country and that the other parties were pursuing different policies seemed no obstacle to his plan for organising a Czech political and military struggle on the side of the Allies. He had made his view on legitimacy explicit in 1913: The modern right of initiative ascribes the leading role to the individual intelligence, emotions, and will. Side by side with the legally appointed and officially recognized leaders of humanity (...) there arise in all domains persons who are assigned leadership or directly and deliberately seize it.45 41 Ibid., p. 195. 42 jbjj^ p.

Neither revolution nor rebellion was excluded from the 'domains' in which Masaryk allowed individuals to seize leadership; this was what democracy meant: A primary democratic claim is the right of individual initiative, and this applies in especial to revolution. The justification for a revolution is not furnished by the participation of the masses, but depends upon the motives of those who recognise and declare that the revolution is necessary, and who initiate and guide the movement. Always, however, it is essential to adduce proof that the revolution is actually in con? formity with the true interests of the people, that it represents a real progress in democratic evolution, and that it is indispensable.47 Ethically considered revolution is permissible only in the last resort. Not until all other means have been tried must we have recourse to the extreme measure of revolution, and then only after the most profound searchings of conscience.48 Masaryk returned to the theme of revolution and democracy many years later when Emil Ludwig asked him if 'the ideal revolutionary' was a man 'with a careful reasoning mind or one who is guided more by passion': A careful thinker, a calculator, a mathematician. Democracy means self-rule. Autonomy begins with the self. How can I govern others if I do not govern myself? Revolution is the supreme right of self- determination whereby I take the initiative into my own hands.49 Masaryk was not concerned to reconcile the self-government of others with autocratic rule by himself; nor did he believe that the people's true interests could best be ascertained by consulting their wishes. During the war he often thought about the organisation of government in Bohemia after its liberation. He had hoped, he recol? lected later, that the Czech legions 'might march with the Allied armies through Germany. The victors might dictate peace in Berlin as the Germans dictated it in Paris or Versailles.'50 From Berlin We should march by way of Dresden to Prague, I as dictator which indeed I was after the soldiers had proclaimed me as such. At the head of 60,000 men I was master of the situation and could take quick measures to convoke parliament, everything promptly?one, two, three.

The incorporation of non-Czech territories and populations into the new Czechoslovakia is equally instructive. Masaryk invoked many principles, reasons and rights to justify it. But he never en? visaged any device for so organising the new state that even if it had to contain many nationalities none of them need constitute ruling or ruled nations. Under pressure of circumstances and for tactical rea? sons Masaryk's war-time writings used a language which lent itself to various interpretations and did not always reveal his true thoughts. This was true of his references to 'self-determination'. Only when he dealt with its 'application' was it the real Masaryk who spoke; and it could not be otherwise so long as he believed that the state was the instrument by which a nation promoted its own welfare and kept other nations in submission.52 His deeds and words between 1914 and 1920 are also explicable in terms of his disbelief in the capacity of ordinary men, 'the masses', to determine their interests for themselves and decide on appropriate action. With this went his belief that there was always only one right course which would reveal itself to the chosen few. It is possible to detect traces of an uneasiness that affected Masaryk when he faced the problem of a people's interests and decisions. Thus he told the Germans that it was in their own interest for more of them to be in Czechoslovakia: 'our Germans', he used to say, 'may deter? mine to remain with us, as the Swiss Germans have determined to stay outside Germany'. It was a great political benefit to the Germans to belong to many states just as it was to the French who belonged to France, Belgium and Switzerland.53 But it never occurred to Masaryk that it was for the Germans themselves to decide what their interest was; that the Czech Germans did decide what they wanted; and that those whom he called 'the French' in Belgium or Switzerland 51 E. Ludwig, op. cit., p. 149. 52 T. G. Masaryk, The New Europe, London, 1918, p. 53. Was it more just, Masaryk asked, 'that ten and a half million Czechs should be under foreign rule, or that two and a half million non-Czechs should be under Czech rule?' The alternatives apparently were thought to be exhaustive; they were not. It would have been possible so to delimit the frontier that minorities would be substantially cut down. The Dutch correspondent who interviewed Masaryk in 1919 had this possibility in mind: 'You won't leave a half million Czechs to the Germans yet you want to have three million Germans annexed to the Czechoslovak State. How do you explain this, Mr President ? 'A nation of seventy million like the Germans can much more easily lose three million souls than a nation of ten million can lose half a million; and this consideration is here the only right one*.

Against the German claim for separation from the Czechs Masaryk wrote in The Making of a State: Individual rights are not the sole governing factors in the question of whether a whole, or parts of a whole, shall be independent; the rights of others enter into it, economic rights no less than the claims of race and tongue; and in our case Czech rights as well as German, and considerations of reciprocal advantage, especially in the economic sphere.54 This appears to be the only passage in the book where an idea of con? tract is suggested and where Czechs and Germans are spoken of as agents with equal rights. But Masaryk really meant something else. He was concerned with the economic disadvantages which were likely to result for the Czechs from the separation of German areas; and he claimed the right of the Czechs as well as of the Germans to benefit economically from these areas. The logical conclusion from his state? ment was not drawn: one party was to decide what was of'reciprocal advantage'. In 1919 a Hungarian journalist asked Masaryk how the annexation of Slovakia could be reconciled with the right of self-determination since the Slovak representatives to the Prague national assembly had not been elected but appointed by the government. When he sugges? ted a plebiscite, Masaryk replied: I regard the plebiscite as a double-edged weapon. He who agitates wins. And in so far as Slovakia in particular is concerned, one should allow no voting there at all. Slovaks had been so oppressed that they never had an opportunity to think politically and so they would not even know how to decide on their fate. In such circumstances one has to accept the view of the leaders of the people.55 Masaryk held that the most important thing about the Slovaks was that they were really Czechs.56 If some thought differently, could there be better proof of their ignorance (which hardly made them representative) and of the harmful effects of Hungarian rule ? Masaryk must soon have realised that a plebiscite would not be safe if two parties agitated. At any rate, in 1919 his opinion about the 54 Ibid., p. 386. 55 Cesta demokracie, I, p. 71. 56 'The Slovaks are Bohemians in spite of their using their dialect as their literary language.'

The occasion was the Teschen question: We are principally against a plebiscite because we stand by our political principles which we formulated at the beginning of the War and which we have followed up till now. We have not allowed for a plebiscite in Bohemia or in Slovakia; Silesia has for centuries been part of our State, we have full right to Silesia and the right does not change with can? vassing and voting. We may cede a part of our territory . . . but we may not let a vote be taken about [the subject of] our legal conviction.57 Masaryk's view about the status of the Germans?and by implica? tion of the other minorities in Czechoslovakia?was made public in his inaugural message as president 'to the Czechoslovak Nation' delivered on 22 December 1918: As to the Germans in our lands, our programme has been known long since; the territory inhabited by the Germans is our territory and will remain ours. ... I repeat: we have built our State; through that is determined the constitutional position of our Germans who originally came in our land as emigrants and colonists. . . .58 He repeated on many subsequent occasions that it was his strong wish to see the Germans and all other minorities reconciled to the new state and co-operating with the Czechs and Slovaks. He admitted that the problem of the Germans was particularly important owing to their numbers, their economic and cultural strength, and the prox? imity of the Reich; and he emphasised the need to treat them justly. Naturally, the Germans outside Germany are entitled to political freedom and to a due share in the administration of the States to which they belong. . . . In a democracy it obviously is the right of every party to share in the administration of the State as soon as it recognizes the policy of the State and the State itself. Nay, it is its duty to share in it.59 He also said on another occasion:'We will concede to them all that is rightly their due, we should never fall into the Austrian methods of concessions by instalments or compensations made in emergency'.60 But these statements raise several questions. Firstly, Masaryk only grants 'minorities' a right to a share in administration; he does not seem to recognise their right to take part in the organisation of the state. Secondly, he looks on a nation other than the Czechoslovak nation as 'a party' and makes its right to take part in administration dependent on conditions: it must first recognise the policy of the state 57 Ferdinand Peroutka, Budovdnl Stdtu, 4 vols., Prague, 1932-36, II (1932), p. 1269. 58 T.

He thus made the rights of citizens dependent on their previous acceptance of the state rather than the authority of the state depen? dent on the consent of the ruled. To this some of his critics replied that the rights of men to cultivate and protect their nationality wTere not derived from a state's arbitrary act. Thirdly, Masaryk spoke of 'concessions' to the Germans: 'we will concede to them . . . their due'. But were not the Germans citizens of the state and was not the president of the republic their president also ? In these circumstances who was to make 'concessions' to them? Professor Radi rightly compared Masaryk's view that the ruling nation granted rights to national minorities with the attitude of former enlightened despots when they issued a 'patent of toleration' to religious minorities.61 It would seem that the only restriction which Masaryk placed on the actions of a nation was its own sense of duty, responsibility, and sympathy for others; in case of doubt the judge would be the nation itself (or its leader). VI The only institutional aspect of democracy which interested Masa? ryk was his rights as president of the new Czechoslovak republic. In 1919 he suggested that in accordance with what he called the Ameri? can example the president ought to be free to choose as ministers not only party politicians but specialists from outside parliament. He was never granted this prerogative himself. But he exercised it in an extra-constitutional manner by resorting on several occasions to a cabinet of officials which was independent of parliament.62 When exercising the president's right to appoint other officials, he said that before he made a decision he spoke 'with the ministers, publicists, journalists and experts ... I endeavour to keep myself informed about various persons and on the general situation. But I do not discuss questions of principle with anybody'.63 It seems fairly certain, for instance, that it was Masaryk's personal influence which led to the tenure of the ministry of foreign affairs by Edvard Benes from 1918 until 1935 when he succeeded Masaryk in the presidency.64 61 E. Radi, op. cit., p. 197. I have followed here the criticism of Masaryk's post-war standpoint made by Professor Radi. {Op. cit., pp. 195-7.) 62 Comparing Czechoslovakia with the Habsburg monarchy, A. J. P. Taylor {The Habsburg Monarchy, London, 1948, p. 255) wrote: 'The parallel was complete when Masaryk resorted to Francis Joseph's device of a cabinet of officials independent of parliament'. 63 E. Ludwig, op. cit., pp. 160-161. 64 This was confirmed by Benes himself when he spoke of the 'moral dictatorship' exercised by Masaryk and of his insistence that Benes should remain minister ('That was decisive').

D</page><page sequence="16">46 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW A characteristic example of Masaryk's unconcern about constitu? tional provisions in a democracy is his comment on the Petka. This was an extra-constitutional body of leaders of the Czech parties, which used to meet informally and take decisions on matters which were later submitted to parliament and rapidly passed by reliance on party discipline. Masaryk commented: As in other democracies our parliament forms out of itself special leading organs. Recently such an organ has formed itself in the Petka. That attempt has interested me from the democratic, and also con? stitutional, point of view from the very beginning. A full parliament is not the place for work and thinking; it has a quite different function. Real work will always be done in committees and in those by still smaller bodies and often by individuals; democracy cannot do without able, knowledgeable and fair experts, workers, leaders.65 His comment is interesting in several respects. Firstly, Masaryk held that parliament was not the right place for working and thinking.66 Secondly, he failed to distinguish between committees elected by the chamber and the Petka, which was an extra-constitutional body, independent of parliament and not always composed of members of parliament. Thirdly, the term 'work' apparently covered the making of decisions, which in a parliamentary system is vested in parliament and not in committees, still less in organs independent of parliament.67 Masaryk's view about the Petka was perhaps connected with his earlier conception of democratic government as administration by experts. VII In 1908 Masaryk had asked in his parliamentary constituency: 'What does progress consist of in the sphere of politics ? What is a progressive programme?' He had answered: To put in one word the political programme of everybody who believes in progress: equality. . . . Another word is liberty. But here again we think of equality, for it is the unequal who strive for freedom, and we are unequal one to another. To put it another way: I could say that our programme is democracy, literally the rule of the people. Against what? What is undemocratic?68 65 Cesta demokracie, II (1934), pp. 209-210. 66 As he said to E. Ludwig: 'Two eyes see less than four. I know that universal suffrage, with proportional representation, does not produce a body of statesmen. But parliament has its uses. The deputies keep current matters before the eyes of the government and of the republic. Then the government or maybe one or two statesmen will see the right lesson that is to be drawn from talks with the deputies and the speeches they make'. (E. Ludwig, op. cit., pp. 236-7.) 67 These criticisms are made by R. N. Foustka, 'Otazka fasisace zakonodarstvi burzoasni Ceskoslovenske* republiky' (Rozpravy Ceskoslovenske" Akademie Ved, Rada SV, vol. 68, 8, 1958, pp. 5O-50- 68 T. G.

This might not be wholly untrue; but political absolutism was possible only where society felt and was organised in an aristocratic way. Political institutions were not the most important factor. Every worker knew that the American and French republics were not much more pleasant for the broad masses of the people than the German, Austrian or other monarchies. The source of evil lay elsewhere: 'Societies are organized according to the aristocratic principle: we all are aristocrats still!' 'Aristocracy' pre? vailed everywhere. Some men went to the university and others did not: T am an aristocrat myself, Masaryk confessed, meaning his professorship, an office which none of his listeners held. There were aristocrats in property; there was a linguistic aristocracy and an aristocracy in religion. As time passed, Masaryk spoke about equality with less and less constraint. On one occasion he said that 'modern democracy pro? claimed not merely political but also economic, social, moral, religious, spiritual and intellectual equality in general'.69 This was nonsense, as he must have known. In the speech of 1908 already quoted he defined equality more cautiously. 'By equality we under? stand practically that inequality which is bearable. . . . Equality begins when one does not want to use another man as a means but recognises that he too is an end of total evolution.'70 At the same time his notion of democracy became more concrete: Now, what does it mean to be a democrat, politically, socially, economically, in public life? It means to work. Democratisation will take place when men, in their respective spheres, become industrious, become true workers and labour with conviction and conscientiously.71 Masaryk also tended to conceive of liberty in a similar way. In an earlier work he quoted approvingly a saying of Anastasius Griin: 'Liberty is not enjoyment but work, incessant work in the interest of the great cultural tasks of the modern state'.72 For this education was necessary; and it is significant that although Masaryk rarely dis? cussed democracy in terms of the actual working of its institutions, he constantly examined the problem of educating wise and good leaders and citizens in general :73 'whatever the form of a parliament may be', he wrote, 'education and morality on the part of its members are essential postulates'.74 Education and morality could develop in 69 K. Krofta, Masaryk's Political Democracy, Prague, 1935, p. 2. 70 T. G. Masaryk, 'Potfeba pokrokove" politiky' {Masarykuv Sbornik, I, 2, 1924, p. 172). 71 Ibid. 72 T. G.

It was also asked whether he who said 'Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's' could really be called a democrat.77 Misgivings were also felt at Masaryk's 'antithesis between Beethoven and Bismarck', with Beet? hoven as the representative of democracy in Germany.78 Both these examples suggest that Masaryk was inclined to call a government 'democratic' if the rulers felt sympathy and love towards the governed (as Jesus did towards all men), or if they directed their rule to the promotion of the good, or even if they merely advanced the public welfare.79 Nor did he think that their actions must necessarily accord with prevailing opinions, particularly opinions which were 'wrong'.80 Professor Radl's comments on Masaryk's 'democracy of humanity', though they refer primarily to the German minority and its rights, might be applied generally: It is the characteristic feature of humanitarian democracy in Masaryk's interpretation that it speaks from the point of view of a statesman who possesses sovereign power and limits it out of its sympathy for other men. Thus it does not see democracy as defective when the authority of the State legislative and administrative apparatus has practically no limi? tations. This democracy seeks those limitations only in the free will of the legislator who from moral conviction sets out to treat his fellow-man humanely.81 The only aspects of political liberty about which Masaryk wrote 75 E. Ludwig, op. cit., p. 237. 76 T. G. Masaryk, Svetovd revoluce, Prague, 1925, p. 608. Also earlier (The New Europe, p. 74): * Caesar or Jesus?that is the watchword of democratic Europe'. 77 E. Radi, op. cit., p. 85; K. Vorovka, Dve studie 0 Masarykove filosofii, Prague, 1926, p. 24. 78 The Making of a State, pp. 308-9. It may be added that by 'democratic art* Masaryk understood that which gave the possibility of 'influencing the masses . . . large numbers of persons simultaneously'. The Spirit of Russia, II, p. 513. 79 In 1933 Masaryk told a Reuter correspondent: 'In fascism, indeed, there is an element of democracy. To be successful fascism must refer to public opinion and interest. Mussolini has put monarchy aside. He has formed a sort of republic. Caesar must always do something in order to be popular and to make up for the old authority. How far is this way democratic? It aims, really, at a popular rule to some extent'.

Ludwig that he would use state authority to raise the minimum age of marriage of men and women to twenty-eight and twenty-four respectively, to encourage chastity and prevent divorce, and to forbid birth control. E. Ludwig, op. cit., pp. 242-5. 81 E. Radi, op. cit., p. 196. To that philosophy Radi opposed one which limited the rights of the state by those of individuals and not by the sentiment and goodwill of the sovereign.</page><page sequence="19">MASARYK S IDEA OF DEMOCRACY 49 were freedom of conscience and freedom of speech. But he never occupied himself with the legal side even of these freedoms. He defended them against the Catholic church and against the state which supported it. But, as F. Fajfr has said, he shifted the emphasis even here from 'right' to 'duty' and treated freedom of conscience and speech as a prerequisite of the successful struggle of science against myth.82 Fajfr traced this feature of Masaryk's political thought to the influence of Comte;83 but it may also have been due to a religious element in his Weltanschauung and perhaps to a residuum of the Platonic idea of philosopher-kings who were not to be fettered by ties of law. Democracy, Masaryk said in his later years, was 'a complete view of the world which strives after fraternity, not only in the getting of daily bread, but also in the laws, in science and education, in morals and religion'.84 This possibly expresses the central idea which Masaryk's ideal 'good society' was intended to fulfil. 'Fraternity' did not imply, or require, political democracy, liberty or equality; society was to be supported by a sense of duty and solidarity among its members.85 Masaryk was thus harking back to his schemes of 1898 and even 1876, except that he now abstained from mentioning government by the best and wisest, which was the other element of his structure. He therefore gave the impression that he was much less clear than he really was and led many of his contemporaries to regard him as a romanticist, a political mystic, or an eclectic. 82 F.Fajfr/Masarykovafilosofiedemokracie' (Masarykuv Sbornik, 1,3,1924, pp.212,214). 83 In his Systems de politique positive Comte spoke of the society of the future in which only duty would be known with a total elimination of 'rights'. 84 K. Krofta, op. cit., p. 2. 85 Masaryk's distinction between Catholicism ('with its anti-ecclesiastical negation') and Protestantism ('with its critical super-ecclesiasticism') was related to his concern with solidarity. While 'Voltaire, the Catholic, is the revolutionary negation of the church', 'Rousseau, the Calvinist, endeavours to sustain democracy by means of a civil religion' (The Spirit of Russia, II, p. 522). Scholars of Rousseau do not usually quote his ideas on civil religion when they speak of democratic elements in Rousseau's thought. But civil religion would sustain solidarity, that 'consensus of opinion' which Masaryk praised in the German nation (e.g. in The Ideals of Humanity and How to Work, London, 1938, pp. 187-188).</page></plain_text>
