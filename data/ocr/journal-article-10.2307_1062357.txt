<plain_text><page sequence="1">John J. Collins COSMOS AND SALVATION: JEWISH WISDOM AND APOCALYPTIC IN THE HELLENISTIC AGE "Wisdom" and "apocalyptic" have traditionally been regarded in biblical studies as two quite distinct types of literature and thought. Recently the distinction has been put in question by the thesis of Gerhard von Rad that apocalyptic is rooted in wisdom.' Von Rad realized that the Hebrew wisdom books lack the interest in eschatology which he himself considered the "sicherste Spezi- fikum" of apocalyptic, but argued that the encyclopedic interests of wisdom could have been expanded to include the "last things." 2 His argument betrays a certain ambiguity as to what is meant by "wisdom"-whether it is defined in terms of the books which are usually classified as wisdom literature (Proverbs, Job, Koheleth, Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon) or in terms of the supposed interests of a scribal class. The most fruitful subsequent studies which have 1 G. von Rad, Theologie des Alten Testaments, 4th ed. (Munich: Kaiser Verlag, 1965), 2:315-30: "die apokalyptischen Schriften sowohl hinsichtlich ihrer Stoffe wie hinsichtlich ihrer Fragestellungen wie hinsichtlich ihrer Argumentation in den tberlieferungen der Weisheit wurzeln" (p. 327); also Wisdom in Israel (Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1972), pp. 263-83. A connection between wisdom and apocalyptic was proposed as early as 1857 by L. Noack (see J. M. Schmidt, Die jiidische Apokalyptik [Neukirchen Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag des Erziehungs- vereins, 1969], pp. 13-14). 2 Von Rad, Theologie, 2:328. 121</page><page sequence="2">Cosmos and Salvation related wisdom and apocalyptic have in fact looked outside the conventional wisdom literature for their evidence. H. P. Muller has convincingly argued that "mantic wisdom" of the type represented in Daniel 1-6 plays an important part in apocalyptic literature but this type of "wisdom" has no necessary relation to what we find in Proverbs or Sirach.3 J. Z. Smith has argued that "wisdom and apocalyptic are related in that both are essentially scribal phenomena" and "the paradigmatic thought of the scribe" has given rise to both.4 This conclusion is certainly justified but its significance is somewhat diluted by Smith's own contention that "the faith of the scribe . . .permeates every other genre of literature as well, including the historiographic."5 Smith has shown that common thought patterns can be found throughout a wide range of Hellenistic-oriental literature and that neither Jewish wisdom nor apocalyptic can be considered in isolation. However, there remains the question raised by von Rad whether the peculiar type of wisdom represented by the Jewish wisdom books has anything in common with apocalyptic other than that which is common to "every other genre of literature." There is in fact evidence for a more direct rapprochement between the conventional biblical wisdom tradition and apoca- lyptic literature. This evidence is found in the Wisdom of Solomon, which Johannes Fichtner, in 1937, described as an "apokalyp- tisches Weisheitsbuch," or at least "apokalyptisierendes." 6 The Wisdom of Solomon was composed somewhere around the turn of the era, too late to lend any support to von Rad's theory that 3 H.

In this essay we will begin by discussing the ideas which provide the unity and coherence of the Wisdom of Solomon, and consider the eschatology of the book in the light of these ideas. Then we will relate the Wisdom of Solomon to other developments in the Hellenistic world. Finally we will compare and contrast the world view of Wisdom with that of the Jewish apocalypses. THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON The Wisdom of Solomon may be divided into three sections: the "book of eschatology" in chapters 1-5, the "book of Wisdom" proper in chapters 6-9, and the "book of history" in chapters 7 There is no precise indication of the date of the Wisdom of Solomon. Proposed dates range from the second century B.C.E. to about 40 C.E. For a summary see J. Reider, The Book of Wisdom, Dropsie College ed. (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1957), pp. 12-14. 8 Von Rad, Theologie, 2:329. Von Rad touches briefly on the cosmological interest in the Wisdom of Solomon in Theologie, 2:317-18, and on its treatment of history in Wisdom in Israel, pp. 282-83, "by way of a footnote," but he never discusses it in detail. 9 Mention should be made of two contributions to the discussion of wisdom and apocalyptic which suffer from their failure to consider the "eschatologising of wisdom." P. von der Osten-Sacken (Die Apokalyptik in ihrem Verhlltnis zu Prophetie und Weisheit, Theologische Existenz heute, 157 [Munich: Kaiser Verlag, 1969]) takes Koheleth as his main example of wisdom, and, not sur- prisingly, finds that it has little in common with apocalyptic. J. G. Gammie ("Spatial and Ethical Dualism in Jewish Wisdom and Apocalyptic Literature," Journal of Biblical Literature 93 [1974]: 356-85) points out certain features which are common to wisdom and apocalyptic but he does not provide an explanation and does not show the significance of the elements in question for either wisdom or apocalyptic. 10 Larcher, pp. 181-236; J.

The overall purpose of the book is clearly stated in the opening verse: it is an exhortation to "the judges of the earth" to "love righteousness."14 However, Pseudo Solomon does not rely on direct gnomic exhortation in the style of proverbial literature but grounds his message in a view of the universe and of human destiny.15 Specifically, he maintains that there is an order in the world which is directed to salvation and well-being: "God did not make death and he does not delight in the death of the living. For he created all things that they might exist, and the generative forces of the world are conducive to salvation."'6 The salvific tendency of the world is explained by the presence of righteous- ness in the world: "Neither is there a kingdom of Hades upon earth, for righteousness is immortal.'17 The exhortation to love 11 So J.

Press, 1963), pp. 24-25; E. G. Clarke, The Wisdom of Solomon, Cambridge Bible Commentary (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973), pp. 3-4. A slightly different division is proposed by A. G. Wright, "The Structure of the Book of Wisdom," Biblica 48 (1967): 165-84. J. M. Reese ("Plan and Structure in the Book of Wisdom," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 27 [1965]: 391-99) also distinguishes "the book of divine justice and human folly" (11:15-15:19) but this section is directly related to the punishment of the Egyptians at the Exodus and so should be regarded as a subsection of the "book of history." 12 E.g., F. Focke (Die Entstehung der Weisheit Salomos [Gottingen: Vanden- hoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1913]) argued that chaps. 1-5 come from a different hand than the rest of the book. For a concise summary of the debate, see Reider, pp. 15-22. 13 See especially the discussion by Reese (Hellenistic Influence, pp. 122-45). Reese argues that the use of flashbacks and recurring themes tie the various sections together and present a consistent theological outlook. 14 Reese, Hellenistic Influence, p. 117, categorizes the book as a logos pro- treptikos or didactic exhortation. 15 Gnomic exhortation was not foreign to Hellenistic Judaism, as is shown by the sayings of Ps. Phocylides (see A. M. Kurfess, "Das Mahngedicht des sogenan- nten Phokylides im zweiten Buch der Oracula Sibyllina," Zeitschrift fir die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, 38 [1939]: 171-81). 16 Wisd. of Sol. 1:13-14.

Goodrick, The Book of Wisdom, Oxford Church Bible Commentary (London: Rivingtons, 1913), pp. 96-97. Most translations render soterioi by "wholesome" (RSV, Reider) or an equivalent, but the lexika favor an active sense "saving" or "delivering." See also G. Ziener, Die theologische Begriffsprache im Buche der Weisheit, Bonner Biblische Beitrage, 11 (Bonn: Peter Hanstein, 1956), p. 137, who translates "heilbringend." 17 Wisd. of Sol. 1:14-15. The personification of Hades here echoes apocalyptic language; cf. Rev. 6:8 and 20:13-14. 124</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions righteousness is therefore an urging to put oneself in tune with that force in the world which is immortal and leads to immortality. The way in which humanity is related to the salvific forces of the world is further expressed in terms of wisdom. Wisdom is, of course, the human attribute of understanding, but it also has a cosmic dimension. Wisdom is a spirit that loves humanity (philanthropon gar pneuma sophia), evidently synonymous with the "holy spirit of discipline" and the "spirit of the Lord" which "has filled the inhabited earth" and "holds all things together."18 This spirit/wisdom "will not enter a soul that devises evil nor dwell in a body that is subject to sin."19 By implication, it will enter into a righteous soul and abide in a sinless body-or, in the formulation of Wisd. of Sol. 7:27: "generation by generation passing into holy souls she makes them friends of God and prophets." Human beings become wise, and friends of God, by the indwelling of the spirit of wisdom, which is also the cosmic principle which holds all things together. While Wisd. of Sol. 1:4 implies that the recipient of wisdom must already be righteous, Wisd. of Sol. 7:27 suggests that it is wisdom which makes them righteous, but we should not regard these statements as opposed. Rather, wisdom and righteousness are inseparable. Neither is found without the other. What is important is that the wisdom and righteousness of an individual is not an isolated relationship with God but partakes of an order and purpose which is immanent in the universe. The cosmic dimension of wisdom is expressed most elaborately in chapters 6-9 (the "book of Wisdom" proper). Wisdom is so embedded in the universe that it can be expressed in physical terms-"manifold, subtile, mobile, clear, unpolluted," pervading all things by reason of her pureness.20 In 8:1 Wisdom is quite explicitly the principle or order, which "reaches mightily from end to end and orders all things well." When Wisdom enters into people, it does not simply make them just. The transformation is not only moral. It is first of all an appropriation of wisdom, which involves "an accurate knowledge of the things that are, to know the structure of the world and the working of the elements, the 18 Wisd. of Sol. 1:5-7.

So the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.22 The righteousness and destiny of the individual depend on the appropriation of the wisdom which orders the universe. The description of cosmic wisdom in chapters 6-9 may well be considered the heart of the book. The other two sections (1-5 and 10-19) illustrate the way in which this wisdom affects the destiny of the individual and the course of history. The "book of eschato- logy" contrasts the righteous with the impious. The fate of each is ultimately determined by their understanding of God and the world. The impious are those who "reasoned not rightly" (2:1) and "knew not the mysteries of God" (2: 22). Consequently they resolve to "let our strength be the rule of our righteousness for weakness is proved to be unprofitable" (2:11). When the judgment comes they realize their mistake: "we erred from the path of truth . .. and we did not know the way of the Lord" (5: 6-7). By contrast, the righteous individual "professes to have knowledge of God" and "declares the end of the righteous blessed" (2:13,16). Consequently such people are not seduced by the short- term gains of wickedness, for their hope is full of immortality (3:4). Those who understand and appreciate the role of righteous- ness in the world order can avail of its fruits: "the righteous live forever" (5:15). Not only are the wicked condemned by God; they are also rejected by the forces of the cosmos, since God "will make all creation his weapons for the repulse of his foes" (5:17). Salvation and judgment are not divorced from the workings of the world but are a necessary consequence of the way the world is ordered. The wise man, who understands the structure of the world, also understands the principles of God's judgment and can live his life in the light of those principles. The involvement of the cosmos in the relations between God and humanity is even more vividly illustrated in the "book of 21 Wisd. of Sol. 7:17-18. Ziener, pp. 140-41. 22 The sorites is imperfect, since it should conclude by joining the beginning and end: "the beginning of wisdom makes one near to God" (see Goodrick, p. 175). 126</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions history" in chapters 10-19. These chapters consist of a brief review of the history recorded in the book of Genesis (chap. 10) and a lengthy reflection on the Exodus (chaps. 11-19).23 However, Pseudo Solomon is not concerned with the recitation of "salvation history" as the unique and exceptional history of Israel. No individual names are used. Each of the biblical characters illust- rates a type, the "righteous"-in 10:4, Noah; in 10:5, Abraham; in 10:6, Lot; in 10:10, Jacob; etc.24 Further, the events in question are not ascribed to the direct intervention of God but to the con- stant activity of wisdom in the world. Revelation does not take place by theophanies, but by the constant mediation of wisdom.25 The primary locus of revelation is the world, created by word and wisdom (9:1-2). The history of Israel provides a paradigmatic example of the experience of righteous individuals or a righteous people, but it is only an illustration of the workings of the universe. Wisdom and righteousness are not necessarily confined to Israel. The experience of Israel and its enemies is expressed as an experience of the cosmos rather than a direct encounter with God. Idolators are punished "by means of those very creatures whom they esteemed as gods" (12:27). The plagues of Egypt and the crossing of the sea reveal that "nature fights for the righteous" (15:17) and that "creation, ministering to thee its maker, strains itself against the unrighteous for punishment and slackens for bene- ficence on behalf of those that trust in you [God]" (16: 24).26 Even when "the whole creation in its particular nature was fashioned again anew complying with your commands so that your servants might be kept unharmed," this miraculous transformation does not require a direct intervention of God. Instead, it is brought about by an inner mutation of the universe, prompted only by God's command: "the elements, being changed in order among 23 These chapters are frequently called a "midrash," but this use of the term seems excessively loose.

Mack, "Imitatio Mosis: Patterns of Cosmology and Soteriology in the Hellenistic Synagogue," Studia Philonica 1 (1972): 30-31. 25 In Wisd. of Sol. 18:15 the "all-powerful word" of God leaps from heaven as a stern warrior, in a passage strikingly similar to Rev. 19:11-16. However, in view of the frequent equivalence of "word" and "wisdom" this passage may be taken as an epiphany of wisdom rather than directly of God. A list of passages in Hellenistic Jewish texts where word and wisdom are equivalent can be found in L. K. K. Dey, The Intermediary World and Patterns of Perfection in Philo and Hebrews, Society of Biblical Literature Dissertation Series, 25 (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1975), p. 8. 26 See especially P.

T. S. Goodrick: "Even miracles are regarded by 'Wisdom' not as a derangement of the universe, but as a rearrangement of the har- mony of it."28 The hand of God can, of course, be discerned in the workings of the cosmos. It is precisely from the greatness and beauty of creation that the creator is recognized (13:1).29 Wisdom involves the recognition of God through the works of creation, since this is required by a full understanding of the world. It is the wisdom which recognizes God which leads to righteousness and im- mortality: "For to know thee is perfect righteousness and to know thy might is the root of immortality."30 Yet this knowledge is indirect, mediated by wisdom, through the cosmos. It is not given directly by the prophetic "word of the Lord" or by ecstatic revelation.3' It appears then that the Wisdom of Solomon presents a coherent theology throughout the book. God is encountered through the cosmos, by wisdom. History illustrates the structure of the universe, and eschatology is also built in to that structure. The human way to salvation is by understanding the structure of the universe and adapting to it in righteousness. Human destiny is not predetermined by the structure of the universe but it is framed by the fixed and limited options provided by that structure. THE COSMOS AND RELIGION IN NEAR EASTERN AND HELLENISTIC THOUGHT The world view of the Wisdom of Solomon is based on the belief that human destiny, history, and eschatology are all bound up with the structure of the universe. This belief must be seen in the light of the religious importance of the cosmos throughout the ancient Near East, but especially in the context of the Hellenistic age, when the older religious traditions underwent some significant changes. 27 See the discussion by J. P. M. Sweet, "The Theory of Miracles in the Wisdom of Solomon," in Miracles, ed. C. F. D. Moule (London: A. R. Mowbray &amp; Co., 1965), pp. 115-26. 28 Goodrick, p. 251. 29 See T.

Murphy, "To Know Your Might Is the Root of Immortality [Wisd. of Sol. 15:3]," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 25 (1963): 88-93. 31 Wisdom is given to Solomon in response to prayer in Wisd. of Sol. 7:7, but the gift consists of the ability to understand; it is not an infusion of ready-made knowledge; see below. 128</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions The importance of the cosmos in religion and mythology all the world over has been established at length by Mircea Eliade.32 In the more specific context of the eastern Mediterranean, Cornelius Loew has written of the "cosmological conviction" which was fundamental to the world view of ancient Mesopotamia. This conviction held that "the meaning of life is rooted in an encom- passing cosmic order in which man, society and the gods all participate."33 The cosmological conviction was often expressed in narratives in the mythological mode: "the Sumerians and their successors could express their convictions about the meaning and purpose of life by telling stories about the gods, especially 'creation stories' describing the primordial establishment of cosmic organization in terms of activities of the gods and relationships they established."34 These mythological narratives express the belief that human destiny is bound up with a greater order of things and that it is important to understand that order by whatever means. In the biblical tradition, the cosmological conviction was modified by the dominance of monotheistic faith in Yahweh, who was sharply distinguished from the created universe. Never- theless, the Yahwist and the Priestly source begin with accounts of creation. Further, the sacred history of Exodus and Sinai also fills the role of cosmogonic myth, since it explains the structure of the world by recounting the way in which Israel was created.35 The sacred history of the Hebrews, like the creation stories of the Mesopotamians, gives expression to the structure of the universe by the use of narratives in the mythological mode. Over against the mythological mode, which explains first principles and ultimate realities by reference to the acts of a god or gods, we may set the conceptual mode of science and philosophy which relies on abstract and impersonal categories (being, matter). The development of conceptual thinking, the "discovery of the mind" has rightly been credited to the Greek thinkers of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E.36 In the words of Loew: "These thinkers 32 See, e.g., Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Return, Patterns in Comparative Religion (n. 5 above). 33 C. Loew, Myth, Sacred History and Philosophy (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1967), p. 5. Loew draws heavily on the 3-vol. opus of Eric Voegelin, Order and History (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1956-57). See further J. Z.

Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973), pp. 112-44, esp. p. 120. 36 Snell (n. 5 above), pp. 191-245; Loew, pp. 204-38. 129</page><page sequence="10">Cosmos and Salvation and their colleagues achieved one of the great differentiating insights in human history. They discovered that nature, as given in man's experience, is an autonomous realm."37 Despite his statement that "all things are full of gods," Thales spoke of water, not Oceanus or Poseidon, as the first principle of the universe. When Anaximander claimed that no element or individual thing could be the first principle, he spoke in abstract impersonal terms of the Apeiron or Unlimited, not of a divinity outside the world. The Ionian cosmologists were the first thinkers in antiquity to attempt to grasp the universe in a purely conceptual mode. However, there were intermediary stages between full-fledged mythology and scientific or philosophical cosmology. Werner Jaeger has pointed to the Theogony of Hesiod as "one of the preparatory stages of the philosophy soon to come."38 By in- cluding abstract forces such as Eros in the Theogony and Eris in the Works and Days among his divinities, Hesiod prepared the way for conceptual thinking, while he still thought in the genealogical categories of mythology. An analogous intermediate stage can be found in the wisdom literatures of the ancient Near East.39 In Egypt, Maat is a goddess, daughter of Re, but she can also be equated with law, justice, or primeval order.40 In the Hebrew tradition, personified wisdom represents an intermediary stage between mythology and logic. Its abstract conceptual dimension is indicated by the name "wisdom" but it retains some of the dynamism of mythology by the use of personification. Both Maat and the Hebrew wisdom point to an underlying conception of a cosmic order which is essentially impersonal.41 In Israelite wisdom Yahweh is the ultimate guarantor of this order but he does not interfere with its operation. In Klaus Koch's phrase, his role is one of "midwifery" in bringing acts and events to their natural consequences.42 37 Loew, pp. 216-17. 38 W.

While Wisdom is still personified as a female who can be desired as a bride (8:2), it is more frequently described in objective terms and given a physical dimension which was lacking in the earlier books. While Sirach had spoken of wisdom "pitching its tent" (24:8) in Israel, it showed no signs of a metaphysical theory of how this was possible. The Wisdom of Solomon, however, explains the indwelling of wisdom in the souls of the righteous in accordance with its cosmological conceptions of the physical universe. Wisdom is "more mobile than any motion" and "because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things" so she can "pass into holy souls" (7:27). Again, the physical world is given an autonomy in the Wisdom of Solomon that never appears in the earlier books. Nature fights for the righteous (15:7). This idea had several precedents in the mythological mode in the OT-the stars fought from heaven in Judg. 5:20 and the sun stood still at Joshua's bidding in Josh. 10:12. However, these occurrences are singled out as miraculous. In the Wisdom of Solomon even miracles conform to regular natural laws.44 The importance of knowing the structure of the world is also more prominent here. In the earlier wisdom books it was implied in the encyclopedic interests of the sages, but here it is explicitly related to the wisdom that leads to God. History is now also included in the sphere of wisdom. Already in Sirach the OT supplied a list of examples of righteous men. The Wisdom of Solomon goes further by eliminating proper names and by attri- buting to wisdom a guiding role in the history of Israel. History, like the cosmos, is an illustration of the workings of wisdom. Finally, the effectiveness of wisdom is not limited to the empirical life of the individual. It also endures beyond death, because wisdom and righteousness are immortal and can make righteous people immortal, too. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1972], pp. 130-80). Koch explains such terms as ysllm and hMyb in this sense. Koch's thesis has been disputed by Gese (p. 50), who argues that Yahwism broke through the impersonal character of this order to affirm the freedom of Yahweh. Gese, in turn, has been refuted by H. D. Preuss, "Das Gottesbild der alteren Weisheit Israels," Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel, Supplements to Vetus Testamentum, 23 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1972), pp. 117-45. 43 See Larcher, pp. 97-101. 44 See Sweet (n. 27 above). 131</page><page sequence="12">Cosmos and Salvation In all, then, the Wisdom of Solomon clearly goes beyond the earlier wisdom books by attempting to give a consistent con- ceptual and even scientific account of the world and of human destiny. The universe or cosmos is the context of all human experience, so even religious experience and hopes are expressed in terms which make cosmological sense. The increased prominence of the cosmos in religious concerns must be seen in the context of what A. J. Festugiere has called the "Hellenistic mood."45 The spread of cosmic religion, the expression of religious values in terms of the physical universe, was one of the constituent factors in that mood. Cosmic religion, in turn, had various forms and resulted from various influences. One factor was the spread of Chaldean astron- omy and astrology. The stars had always played a prominent part in the cosmic conviction of the Babylonians but, in the opinion of Franz Cumont, the development of scientific astronomy from the eighth century onward led to a virtually "new religion."46 The astral religion thenceforward identified with the Chaldeans laid far more explicit emphasis on the material universe, especially the stars, although it never completely abandoned the personal anthropomorphic gods, who were either identified with the stars or thought to dwell in them.47 Chaldean astrology bound together history and cosmology by attempting to predict historical events from the movements of the stars. The popularity of these concep- tions throughout the Near East is reflected in the oracles of Nechepso and Petosiris, from Egypt, in the second century B.C.E.48 Astrological predictions play no part in the Wisdom of Solomon, but it is noteworthy that the arrangement of the stars (astron theseis) is listed among the elements of Solomon's wisdom in 7:19. The Chaldean tradition is important, however, as it shows that Festugiere's Hellenistic mood was not confined to the tradition of Greek philosophy but also had roots in the Semitic world. 45 A. J.

Already in Plato, especially in the Timaeus and the Laws, we find a conceptual cosmological reflection on the universe which leads to the recognition of God as the "Soul of the Cosmos."49 This tradition was developed by the Stoics. The Stoics were quite probably influenced by the astral religion of the Chaldeans,50 but they integrated their borrowings into a philosophical system. The Stoic Logos is especially illuminating for the idea of wisdom in the Wisdom of Solomon. The Logos, or Pneuma, was a very fine fiery substance which "permeates and is transfused through the passive matter it organizes." It is at once Nature, God, and Reason. Human reason "literally and physically has a share in the Divine Nature." The ideal of the Stoic wise man is to put himself in harmony with this cosmic principle by living according to nature (or reason).51 The Stoics showed little interest in history as such, but they believed in the periodic destruction and renewal of all things. History and eschatology were ultimately understood in terms of the natural process of the cosmos.52 The human soul was not considered immortal by the earlier Stoics, although it was thought to survive the body for a time until it dissolved. However, later Stoicism found a place for "the idea of 'astral immortality' of the return of the souls of good men to the aethereal regions of the Upper Cosmos whence they came, where they spend a happy immortality contemplating the workings of Divine Reason."53 This belief was part of a syn- cretistic development of Stoicism in the second and first centuries B.C.E., often associated with Posidonius.54 In the words of A. H. Armstrong: "These ideas fit very well into the common world-view 49 Festugiere, p. 49. 50 M.

Yet there are also important differences- most obviously the insistence on a transcendent God in the Wisdom of Solomon as opposed to the immanent divinity of the Stoics. Pseudo Solomon drew freely on various philosophical sources, and in fact the Stoicism of the period was itself syn- cretistic and had embodied elements of other systems, especially Platonism.57 The eclecticism of the Wisdom of Solomon was in keeping with the mood of the age. The relation of the book to Stoicism is limited, then, but nevertheless significant. Both insist that divinity is encountered in and through the universe. In both, history and eschatology are functions of the structure of the universe, and the righteous individual is the wise one who understands that structure and conforms to it. There is clear continuity between the Wisdom of Solomon and earlier Hebrew wisdom. However, precisely at those points where Pseudo Solomon goes beyond his predecessors, in stressing the role of the cosmos as the medium between God and humanity, he is in line with at least one branch of Hellenistic thought. THE AFFINITIES AND DiFFERENCES BETWEEN WISDOM AND APOCALYPTIC When we turn now to the Jewish apocalypses we find considerable areas of affinity with the hellenized wisdom of the Wisdom of 55 Armstrong, p. 144. On astral immortality, see the summary discussion by M. Hengel, Hellenism and Judaism (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1974), 1:197. Astral immortality was known in Greece as early as the fifth century B.C.E., but was not then associated with a physical theory. 56 See Ziener (n. 16 above), pp. 142-50; J. A. F. Gregg, The Wi8dom of Solomon, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, 30 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1909), p. xvii; Larcher, pp. 367-76. 57 Armstrong, pp. 140-47: "it seems quite possible that there was less which was genuinely Platonic in the thought of the 'Platonist' Antiochus than in that of the Stoic Posidonius." 134</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions Solomon. The affinities are grounded in the religious significance of the cosmos. History and eschatology are related to the structure of the universe and salvation is attained by understanding that structure and adapting to it in righteousness. This shared per- spective does not eliminate the very real and significant differences between them, but it does constitute a common bond which distinguishes both the Hellenistic wisdom book and the apoca- lypses from their earlier biblical precedents in wisdom and prophecy. Any comparison of wisdom and apocalyptic in the Jewish tradition must start from the fact that the apocalypses are presented as one kind of wisdom. Daniel, Enoch, Ezra, and Baruch were all sages rather than prophets.58 The heroes of the book of Daniel were maskfilim, wise teachers. In the Enoch literature and Qumran scrolls great emphasis is laid on the understanding of "mysteries."59 In Daniel the knowledge of the maskilim seems to refer primarily to the eschatological denouement of the crisis under Antiochus Epiphanes, but it also includes revelation about the angelic world, in the present.60 In other apocalyptic writings cosmological mysteries are explicitly in- cluded. Enoch discourses at length on "everything that takes place in heaven" and "the earth, and all things that take place on it from first to last" (1 Enoch 2:1-2). Large sections of the book are taken up with heavenly topography and one whole section, the book of the heavenly luminaries, is devoted to the movements of the stars. The mysteries of Qumran include "the heavenly lights according to their mysterious [laws], the stars according to the paths [which they follow] ... the providential reservoirs according to their functions [and snow and hailstones] according to their mysterious [laws]" (1 QH 1:11-12). Cosmic mysteries are in- evitably prominent in apocalypses such as 3 Baruch or 2 Enoch which describe the visionary's journey through the heavens. The apocalyptic determinism of history, stressed by von Rad and others,61 is based on the assumption that the course of events is built into the structure of the universe. In the Qumran Hodayot 58 Von Rad, Theologie, 2:316. 59 See R. E. Brown, The Semitic Background of the Term "Mystery" in the New Testament, Facet Books, Biblical Series, 21 (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1968), pp. 12-30. On wisdom material at Qumran, see J. C.

For clarification of apocalyptic determinism see Collins, Apocalyptic Vision, chap. 3. 135</page><page sequence="16">Cosmos and Salvation (1:21-25): "The world is graven before Thee with the graving tool of the reminder for all the unending seasons together with the cycles of the number of everlasting years with all their times." In 4 Ezra 5:50-55 the imminence of the end is assured by the fact that "creation is already grown old, and is already past the strength of youth": history comes to an end by a cosmological necessity. In the Enochic "book of the heavenly luminaries" (80:6) the eschatological upheavals are accompanied, if not caused, by the transgression of the chiefs of the stars. Cosmological data are also directly relevant to the eschatology of the individual. Enoch's tour of the heavens pays special attention to the "dwelling places of the holy and the resting places of the righteous" (39:4) or the places that "have been created for this very purpose that the spirits of the souls of the dead should assemble therein" (22:3). The cosmology of Enoch is designed to show that the afterlife is provided for in the structure of the universe. The motif of astral immortality which we have noted in the Hellenistic world finds a place in the apocalypses too: "For in the heights of that world shall they dwell, and they shall be made like unto the angels, and be made equal to the stars" (2 Bar. 51:9), or "ye shall shine as the lights of heaven ... and the portals of heaven shall be opened to you.... for ye shall become companions of the hosts of heaven" (1 Enoch 104:2, 6).62 We have seen above that Jewish wisdom in the Hellenistic age stood in continuity with the older biblical wisdom but also differed from it, precisely in its emphasis on the role of the cosmos. Similarly, the Jewish apocalypses show many important links with biblical prophecy. However, the interest of the apocalypses in cosmological data has baffled scholars who approach this material only against the background of OT prophecy.63 Despite the manifold points. of continuity with prophecy, the apocalyptic understanding of revelation and the world is fundamentally different. This is shown especially in the emphasis on wisdom and understanding which we find in the apocalypses. A prophet such as Amos called on his hearers to obey the word of the Lord. The judgment which he threatened could on occasion be averted by 62 Hengel, 1:197. See also Dan. 12:2 and Testament (Assumption) of Moses 10:9 where astral imagery is used and the association with the angelic host is very probably implied. See J. J. Collins, "Apocalyptic Eschatology as the Transcend- ence of Death," Catholic Biblical Quarterly 36 (1974): 21-43. 63 M. Stone ("Lists of Revealed Things in Jewish Apocalyptic," in Magnalia Dei: G. Ernest Wright in Memoriam [Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1976]) has drawn attention to this problem in recent scholarship. 136</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions obedience. By contrast, the external course of events is fixed in the apocalypses. The hearer can only understand and adapt. While understanding presumably leads to obedience (to the Law) there is a significant shift in emphasis from the direct moral imperative to the plea for understanding.64 Since the apocalypses presume that the course of history is built into the structure of the uni- verse, cosmology naturally acquires a new importance. Since apocalyptic eschatology lays great stress on personal afterlife and often associates it with the stars or angels,65 the geography of the heavens acquired relevance for salvation in a way that was lacking in prophecy. In the Jewish apocalypses, then, history and eschatology can be understood in terms of the physical cosmos to a far greater extent than in OT prophecy. Understanding rather than obedience is the key to salvation because God does not address humanity directly but through the fixed order of cosmos and history which he allows to follow its own course. The angelic revelations interpret that order. They do not interrupt it. Those who understand and adapt to the order in righteousness transcend death, often by sharing the life of the angels or the stars. These elements of the apocalyptic world view are also found in the Wisdom of Solomon, in the syncretistic philosophy of late Hellenism, as described by Armstrong, and more broadly, in the Hellenistic mood described by Festugiere. So the Wisdom of Solomon is able to use some motifs drawn directly from apocalyptic tradition. The "mysteries of God" refer to the eschatological "prize for blameless souls" (1:22) and the righteous dead are "numbered among the sons of God." 66 At the same time the book can use Platonic language on the immortality of the soul and echo the Stoics on the physical nature of cosmic wisdom.67 Underlying this fusion of traditions was the common conviction of the Hellenistic age that the wise individual who understands the true structure of the universe is also the righteous one who can attain immortality. 64 See Collins, Apocalyptic Vision, chap. 3. The shift in emphasis can already be seen in postexilic prophecy (e.g., Ezek. 38, 2 Isaiah). On the transitional period after the exile which saw the decline of prophecy and the emergence of some apocalyptic tendencies, see P. D. Hanson, The Dawn of Apocalyptic (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975). 65 See Collins, "Apocalyptic Eschatology." 66 See Ruppert (n. 6 above), pp. 70-105; G. W. Nickelsburg, Resurrection, Immortality and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism, Harvard Theological Studies, 26 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972), pp. 58-62. 67 A. Dupont-Sommer ("De l'immortalite astrale dans la 'Sagesse de Salomon' (3:7)," Revue des etudes Grecques 62 [1949]: 80-86) has argued that Wisd. of Sol. 3:7 (emended) refers to astral immortality, but his opinion is refuted by Larcher, p. 319, n. 2. 137</page><page sequence="18">Cosmos and Salvation The conviction that the experience of God and even eschatology is mediated through the cosmic order constitutes the common ground of wisdom and apocalyptic. This common ground was shared by other movements in the Hellenistic age and cannot be adequately explained by the influence of wisdom traditions on apocalyptic or vice versa.68 In fact, despite their common ground, wisdom (as found in the Wisdom of Solomon) and apocalyptic diverge from each other in very important respects. First, there is an obvious difference in mode. The Wisdom of Solomon is basically written in the conceptual mode of philosophy and science. True, this mode is not perfectly maintained. Traces of mythological conceptions are found-for example, in the "sons of God" or "holy ones" of Wisd. of Sol. 5:5, and the Word of God which leaps from heaven in 18:15. However, the persistent attempts of the book to give a rationally acceptable account of the indwelling of wisdom or of the miraculous renewal of the earth, and the use of the personified concept "wisdom" rather than a fully personal figure such as an angel all reflect an approach to reality which at least aspires to conceptual, philosophical thinking. By contrast, the apocalypses are written in an unequivocally mythological mode. Their world is peopled by supernatural persons, good and fallen angels. If the righteous may be said to be like the stars after death, we are constantly reminded that the stars are identical with the angelic host. Even the most "scientific" apocalypse, the "book of the heavenly luminaries" still identifies the leading stars by angelic names in chapter 82. There is no attempt in the apocalypses to provide a metaphysical theory of wisdom or to explain how the soul becomes immortal. While the apocalypses share the "cosmological conviction," they are closer to the thought patterns of the ancient mythologies than to philosophy or scientific cosmology.69 68 The Hellenistic mood cannot be explained in terms of the influence of one movement on another. Jewish apocalyptic shows no signs of philosophical influence and the analogies with Chaldean astral religion are very imprecise. Rather we should look to the common historical and sociological factors which gave rise to the various movements-e.g., the breakup of the polis in the west and the decline of the national kingdoms in the Near East. Such an inquiry lies beyond the scope of this essay. See J. J. Collins, "Jewish Apocalyptic against its Hellenistic Near Eastern Environment," Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 220 (1975): 27-36; J. Z. Smith, "Native Cults in the Hellenistic Period," History of Religions 11 (1971): 236-49; M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion, 2d ed. (Munich: C. H.

A second contrast between wisdom and the apo- calypses is, therefore, more significant. This concerns the manner in which wisdom is acquired. In both types of writing, wisdom is a gift of God. When Solomon prays from wisdom, however, what he is given is an ability to understand. His knowledge follows from the use of his natural reasoning. By contrast the angelic revelations in the apocalypses give specific knowledge, in the form of visions and prophecies of particular events or heavenly realities. While sapiential revelation is immanent, channeled through the natural human processes of thought, apocalyptic revelation is ecstatic, and conferred from outside.70 The discontinuity between apocalyptic revelation and the normal cognitive process corresponds to the discontinuity of apocalyptic salvation with the normal processes of the world. The idea of personal immortality in the Wisdom of Solomon has much in common with that found in apocalyptic writings. In Wisd. of Sol. 5:5 the assertion that the righteous is numbered among the sons of God or the "saints" reflects the frequent apocalyptic hope for an afterlife with the angels. In both Wisdom and the apocalyp- ses immortality is attained by the wise, who act in righteousness. However, in the Wisdom of Solomon the wisdom and righteous- ness which bring immortality are built into the structure of the universe and constitute the order which pervades both heaven and earth.7' Immortality is therefore in unbroken continuity with the order of this world. In fact, the righteous only "seemed to have died" (3:2). In the apocalypses, by contrast, the wisdom and righteousness which bring immortality are not prevalent on earth. The earthly world is characterized by the absence of cosmic order and stands in sharp discontinuity with both the heavenly world and the world to come. Vision, chap. 4; and especially A. Yarbro Collins, The Combat Myth in the Book of Revelation, Harvard Dissertations in Religion, 9 (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars Press, 1976). The paradigmatic thinking noted by Smith, "Wisdom and Apocalyptic" (n. 4 above), is applied in the apocalypses especially to mythic paradigms. 70 Such ecstatic revelation was also widespread in the Hellenistic world and reflects an aspect of the Hellenistic mood different from the philosophical strand found in Stoicism (see Hengel, 1:210-18). 71 R. J. Taylor, "The Eschatological Meaning of Life and Death in the Book of Wisdom 1-5," Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses 42 (1966): 72-137, insists that immortality in Wisdom is a gift of God, but we must remember that here as in the earlier Wisdom literature, the gift of God is mediated through a cosmic order and so admits of a "natural" explanation. 139</page><page sequence="20">Cosmos and Salvation The Wisdom of Solomon claims explicitly that the generative forces of the world are conducive to salvation and that there is no kingdom of Hades on earth (1:14). In the apocalyptic writings, by contrast, the eschatological crisis is precipitated precisely by the fact that the earth is in the grip of infernal forces-the beasts from the sea in Daniel and the Apocalypse of John, Belial in the Qumran scrolls. In 4 Ezra the generative forces of the world are past their youth and in decline. The salvation which follows is a new creation, distinguished from the old by seven days of primeval silence. The vision of a new heaven and a new earth is one of the most powerful apocalyptic evocations of salvation.72 The Wisdom of Solomon also speaks of a new creation insofar as "the whole creation in its nature was fashioned anew." This, however, was in the past and brought about within the natural processes by the rearrangement of the elements. The salvation of the world does not require its replacement by a new order but lies in the proper working of its natural process and specifically in the multitude of the wise.73 The contrast between wisdom and apocalyptic is strikingly illustrated in the few apocalyptic passages which refer to per- sonified wisdom. An enigmatic fragment in 1 Enoch 42 describes how wisdom sought a dwelling place among men but found none, and so she "returned to her place and took her seat among the angels." While the relation of this passage to its context is obscure, the attitude expressed is typically apocalyptic. Wisdom and order are not found on earth, but only in the angelic world. Apocalyptic wisdom stands in direct contrast to the wisdom of Proverbs, whose delight is to be with the sons of men, and to Sirach, where wisdom finds a home in Israel. The Jewish sapiential tradition is based on the premise that wisdom can be found in all creation. The apocalyptic premise is that the world is in a state of anomie. Wisdom has retired to heaven and can be known only by heavenly revelations.74 72 Note esp. Rev. 21:1; cf. Isa. 65:17, 66:22. 73 Wisd. of Sol. 6:24. The argument of G. Kuhn ("Beitrage zur Erklarung des Buches der Weisheit," Zeitschrift fur die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft 28 [1929]: 334-41) that Wisdom implies a future renewal of the world is uncon- vincing. 74 The Hebrew wisdom book which has greatest affinities with apocalyptic, the Book of Job, also arises out of a failure to find order and justice in the world. In Job 28:13, man does not know the way to wisdom. Consequently Job falls back on a supernatural revelation in the mythological mode where God speaks from a storm cloud and appeals to cosmogonic myth. Job differs from the apocalypses and from the Wisdom of Solomon in its lack of any future eschatology (see Cross [n. 35 above], pp. 343-46). 140</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions The experience of anomie and alienation was increasingly widespread in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, and might even be said to constitute part of the "Hellenistic mood." The cosmic religion of the Hellenistic age had various implications. While the strong sense of cosmic order which typified the Stoics never died out there is also ample evidence that, in the words of J. Z. Smith, "During the hellenistic period, there was a 'radical revaluation' (Hans Jonas's phrase) of this all-pervasive 'cosmological con- viction,' a revaluation which has led classicists such as Gilbert Murray to speak of a 'failure of nerve,' E. R. Dodds to describe the period as 'an age of anxiety,' and Eric Voegelin to formulate a shift from a 'compact experience of the cosmos' to 'a differentiated experience of existential tension."'75 The "cosmic paranoia"76 of late antiquity had various forms, many of which were much more acute than Jewish apocalyptic, where the world was still, at least ultimately, controlled by a good God.77 It is, however, obvious that the "cosmic conviction" of the Hellenistic age contained divergent strands, some of which, like Stoicism and Jewish wisdom insisted that cosmic order embraced the earth, while others, including Jewish apocalyptic, held that wisdom had fled to the heavenly regions and the earth, at least temporarily, was ruled by hostile forces. CONCLUSION Our examination of the affinities between Jewish apocalyptic and the hellenized Wisdom of Solomon has revealed important areas of both similarity and divergence. Wisdom and apocalyptic most obviously differ in their modes of presentation: wisdom basically used the reflective, conceptual language of philosophy; apo- calyptic, the personified language of mythology. More significantly, wisdom found salvation within the processes of nature and affirmed the principle of order in all creation, while apocalyptic posited a sharp break between the heavenly regions and the earthly, or between the present world and the world to come, and 75 J. Z. Smith, "Birth Upside Down or Right Side Up?" History of Religions 9 (1970): 295. 76 Ibid. 77 J. Z. Smith ("A Pearl of Great Price and a Cargo of Yams: A Study in Situational Incongruity," History of Religions 16 [1976]: 1-19) sees a move "from the apocalyptic pattern that the wrong king is on the throne, the cosmos will thereby be destroyed and the right god will either restore proper kingship (his terrestrial counterpart) or will assume kingship himself, to the gnostic pattern that if the wrong king is sitting on the throne then his heavenly counterpart must likewise be the wrong god." Both apocalyptic and gnostic patterns reflect a "situational incongruity"-that the world is out of joint. 141</page><page sequence="22">Cosmos and Salvation rejected the present world order. These differences are important and show that apocalyptic and wisdom embody different per- spectives within the Jewish tradition, which must be carefully distinguished. Nevertheless, despite the significant differences, we have argued that Jewish wisdom and apocalyptic share significant features which distinguish them both from their biblical precedents. They share a "cosmological conviction" by which the way to salvation lies in understanding the structure of the universe and adapting to it. This conviction that God's dealings with the humanity are mediated through the cosmos is distinctly different from the presuppositions of Old Testament prophecy, which calls not for understanding, but for obedience to the word of the Lord. The earlier Hebrew wisdom shares the emphasis on understanding but does not yet relate history and eschatology to cosmology in the explicit manner found in the Wisdom of Solomon. However the integration of eschatological and other religious beliefs with the cosmological understanding of the universe was a dominant characteristic of the Hellenistic age, which is evident in a broad spectrum of forms from the philosophy of the Stoics to the astrology of the Chaldeans. The Jewish literature of the period shared that characteristic, in various ways. The explanation of the common emphasis on the cosmos which Jewish apocalyptic shares with the Wisdom of Solomon and which distinguishes both from the earlier biblical tradition must be sought in their common environment in the Hellenistic age.
