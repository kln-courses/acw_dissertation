<plain_text><page sequence="1">47 SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH By JANE MOON General Introduction Of the excavations that have taken place in Iraq since the 1930s, many have revealed remains dating to the Early Dynastic period. None of these has been published as fully as the Diyala sites excavated by the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute of Chicago from 1930 to 1938. (Frankfort, 1939, 1943, 1955; Delougaz, 1940, 1952, Delougaz and Lloyd, 1942 ; Delougaz, Hill and Lloyd, 1967.) It is these sites that still provide the largest collection of well-stratified pottery for this period, and thus material from newly-excavated sites has always been compared to that from the Diyala region. There are two major disadvantages to this state of affairs. Firstly, it is undesirable that any kind of archaeological material comparison should be limited to just one region or site ; and secondly, notwithstanding the importance of the city of Eshnunna (Tell Asmar), the Diyala region was a fringe area, and the style of its pottery should not have to be accepted as the norm for Southern Mesopotamia or anywhere else. While other major Early Dynastic sites remain unreported in full these problems cannot be completely solved, but the publication of new material offers possibilities for their mitigation. So the aim of this study is quite simply to put together examples of two common types of pottery that occur throughout Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, including many unpublished examples, and to decide how well they fit into the sequence of change of style and manufacture that is reported from the Diyala sites. For this purpose it was decided to use pottery from the recent excavations at Abu Salabikh as a starting point. The Abu Salabikh corpus appeared to be fairly large and, most important of all, was available for study along with the relevant site- records. The two types chosen for investigation are : upright-, or " goddess "-handled jars, and stemmed dishes, or " fruit-stands ". These vessels are frequently cited as chronological indicators (Hrouda and Karstens, 1967; Whelan, 1978), and it was felt that they would be a valid test of the Diyala sequence. They occur frequently in graves, and are therefore well preserved, and their distinctive form may well ensure recognition under less-than-ideal field conditions, such as in rescue work. Moreover, the two types were held to be of considerable interest in their own right, on account of their wide distribution and unusual decoration. Such were the aspirations that accompanied the initiation of the project. It may also be in order to summarize briefly the way in which they became substantially modified. Abu Salabikh is similar in many ways to Kish. While respective standards of excavation and recording have mercifully little in common, the two sites were sharing other problems before their excavators ever arrived. Both, for instance, had been used as graveyards, and the graves had been looted in antiquity (Mackay, *925 : 139 ; Postgate, 1977 : 295). The suitability of the Abu Salabikh pottery for dating is therefore much reduced, for in all but a few cases the level from which the graves were dug can no longer be determined. Also, disturbed, and therefore</page><page sequence="2">48 JANE MOON incomplete, groups of pottery offer less of the sort of information that can be obtained from observed associations of types. While the bulk of available Abu Salabikh pottery was from graves, much importance was attached to that from living levels, for there is no satisfactory way of dating a cemetery without reference to a comparable stratified sequence. There appeared at first to be a considerable quantity of this material, consisting mostly of sherds, but when all disturbed levels had been eliminated from chronological con- siderations, the remaining pottery was not sufficient to permit the sort of conclusions we were hoping to draw. No doubt further excavation will produce better oppor- tunities for this.1 Although other sites considered imposed limitations of at least the same magnitude as Abu Salabikh, various interesting points about our two types did emerge, in particular their immense variability, and it is hoped that the following catalogue will at very least form a useful reference collection. The Diyala sites The sequence of stylistic changes that occurred on upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes in the Diyala region is well known and calls for only a brief summary. The earliest known upright-handled jars came from Archaic Shrine IV of the Abu Temple at Tell Asmar (Delougaz, 1952 : Pis. 76a, 80a). Apart from two further jars that " were found in ED I graves of uncertain stratification " (ibid. : 83 note 129) these are the only upright-handled jars safely dated to ED I, though one should perhaps mention in this connection a scarlet-ware jar found in disturbed ED II?III context at Khafajah, but probably dating to ED I or II (ibid. : 60, PL 15, 60-61) and the painted upright-handled jars that have been found recently at Tell Raz?k, in the Hamrin area. The most complete of the Tell Asmar jars (Delougaz, 1952 : PL 80b) has a small, solid handle with an incised cross of parallel lines. These are standard " early " features, as is the double row of incision around the neck. The cross-hatched triangles on the shoulder remain popular into the Akkadian period. The larger, more fragmentary ED I specimen (Delougaz, 1952 : PL 76a) has a pronounced bevelled-ledge rim, a typical ED I feature, and again, the careful incising around the neck. The handle is equipped with vertical notched ridges and an otherwise unfamiliar triangle pattern. All these features are worth mentioning separately because although this piece is unique, some of the same characteristics reappear in modified form at different times or sites. During the ED II period in the Diyala region these jars become smaller, and many variations of incised designs occur, both on shoulders and handles, and a different type of rim, the band- or collar-rim, is introduced.2 1 We were fortunate to be able to examine pub- lished and unpublished pottery from Kish, Nippur, Isin, Sali' el-Jumr, Tell 'Uqair, Mari, Tell Madhhur, Susa, Ur and Tell el-Wilayah. This will be dealt with in a forthcoming article. 2 Delougaz has noted the " apparent tendency to combine bevelled ledge or overhanging rims with solid handles and band-rims with spout handles " (Delougaz, 1952 : 84), and remarks that " this seems to reflect a much earlier tradition according to which ledge- or overhanging rims were rarely combined with spouts " (ibid. : 84). We have been unable to demonstrate this connection with material from other sites. Nor can we find it anywhere stated by Delougaz that the actual introduction of spout handles marks the transition from ED II to ED III, though this is an assumption apparently made by Whelan (Whelan, 1978: 81).</page><page sequence="3">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 49 Spout handles were at their most popular at the beginning of ED III and small solid ones combined with bevelled-ledge rims had virtually disappeared.3 Towards the end of the ED III period various changes occur : " later specimens of ED III upright-handled jars are on the whole of rather indifferent workmanship. The features which distinguish them from earlier specimens are a taller ring-base, which sometimes approaches a pedestal, a taller neck with correspondingly longer handle, and usually a horizontal ledge-rim. On the whole the handle is placed higher up on the shoulder, and it often touches the rim, though the two are never solidly joined " (Delougaz, 1952: 87). Combed decoration becomes more common and handles occasionally have plastic anthropomorphic features. It is perhaps worth stressing that these are not common among stratified jars (ibid. : 144). The development of stemmed dishes is comparatively simple : a few tall, slender specimens occurred in ED II graves at Khafajah (Delougaz, 1952 : 85) and towards the end of the period smaller ones appeared too. The more squat, elaborately decorated dishes first occurred in ED III, and while they demonstrated a variety of different designs, no chronological development of these has yet been traced. " On the whole the incised designs on ' fruit stands ' are no different from those on upright-handled jars " (ibid. : 91). While the later type of stemmed dish occurs at many sites, and is well known from Kish, the ED II type has not been reported from anywhere except Khafajah. Further pottery from Khafajah By way of a supplement to the published Diyala material, we give here a drawing of one upright-handled jar located in the Iraq Museum and some additional notes on detached handles : 1. Kh. IX 238, IM 42484. Complete. Ht. 39-4 cm, rim di. 10-4 cm max., base di. 10 4 cm. Fairly fine reddish clay with paler surface. Added base in coarser clay. Not well-finished. Incised with four-toothed comb. This jar may have come from a Houses 2 level at Khafajah. Its handle appears in the original report (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 87q), and the rest of it is exactly as one would in fact expect, applying the criteria outlined by Delougaz for late ED III upright-handled jars. The handle is long and thin and solid, with applied face and breasts, including rather startling eyebrows, together with an incised pinnate motif; and the neck is long, the shoulder short with combed decoration, the lower body long and tapering, ending in a fairly high ring-base. The face is rather more sheep-like than human. A square handle with framed St. Andrew's cross came from Houses 3 or 4 (Kh. Ill 661). An unusually long and thin handle with incised St. Andrew's cross may have come from Houses 4 (Kh. Ill 663). In the level dated to Houses 2 was found a handle with applied owl-like eyebrows (Kh. Ill 961). A handle with pinnate motif also came from Houses 2 (Kh. Ill 287). From the ED II grave 107 came a thin, solid handle attached to the shoulder near to the rib. A single scribbled line decorated the shoulder (Kh. V 113). Tell Asmar A broken shoulder from ajar found in the Main Northern Palace had a criss-cross pattern and the handle bore a pinnate motif. It was found in a room at the far South end of the building (As. 32 P. 28). 3 We offer the modification " virtually " in deference to Delougaz' statement that " the variety with flat solid handles and broad bevelled- . . . ledge rim, which occurred throughout the ED II period, was also found in ED III " (Delougaz, 1952 : 87). In fact there is only one illustrated example (C.526.37ia), and no compelling reason to date it later than ED I. The provenance is '* town wall, ED III?".</page><page sequence="4">50 JANE MOON From a passage at the East end of the same building came another fragment with herringbone pattern on the handle and cross-hatched triangles on the shoulder (As. 32 864, C.515.371 a). A handle with pinnate motif was found in Houses V (As. 32 1259). All these are " proto-imperial " levels. Abu Salabikh Introduction Abu Salabikh was an Early Dynastic city 20 km to the north-west of Nippur. We shall consider here fresh material from the first three seasons of excavation conducted by the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, under the direction of Mr. J. N. Postgate (Postgate and Moorey, 1976; Postgate 1977, 1978). It has not been possible to consider fully material from subsequent seasons, but some of the upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes from 1963 and 1965 have been published recently by Miss Estelle Whelan (Whelan, 1978). Layout It became quickly apparent that upright-handled jars, detached handles and stemmed dishes each demand different sorts of comment and benefit from illustra- tion at a different scale. They have therefore been kept separate, associations being cross-referenced where they occur. Within these categories, vessels found in non- burial context come first, arranged as far as possible chronologically. As there is not yet any direct correlation between the three main areas of excavation these have also been separated. Grave pottery comes second, within the vessel-types, again arranged chrono- logically for the three areas. Since full publication of the graves at Abu Salabikh is in preparation, objects other than upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes are mentioned only where the associations are thought to have significance to the current discussion. 1.

Both jars have more or less the same complex shoulder design, and the handle with simple cross and applied nose. They differ in other respects : the first has a more bevelled rim and hollow handle, the second a collar-rim and solid handle. These combinations are in direct opposition to the norm for the Diyala sites. There, however, '" numerous exceptions do occur " (Delougaz, 1952 : 84). Postgate attempted to date Level II of the Area A building using the smaller of these two jars : " its nose on the handle belongs at the very start of the anthropomorphic sequence, and must be placed early rather than late in the ED III period but not perhaps at the very beginning " (Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : 140-141). There is in fact no evidence to suggest that just a nose is any earlier than a whole face : an example from Kish has only a nose on its handle but is otherwise typologically late.4 4 Ashmolean 1924.209. Illustrated by Mackay, 1929: PI. IX no. 9, but the handle decoration is unclear.</page><page sequence="5">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH ?l 10 cm Fig. 1.</page><page sequence="6">52 JANE MOON A jar from Nippur has a shoulder-design nearly identical to that of these two vases, but is painted all over with a pink wash, a feature that by Diyala criteria would be ED II (Delougaz, 1952 : 80).b In summary, these two Abu Salabikh jars are most probably ED III, and we would not exclude the very earliest part of this period. 4. AbS 1094. Almost complete. Ht. 46-6 cm, rim di. 21 4 cm, base di. 18 o cm. Fine pink clay, cream surface. Incised decoration. Context : found in situ with No. 3 above, on the floor of Room 2. Similar to what is preserved of No. 1, with bevelled rim and hollow handle. The relatively elaborate incised decoration at the base of the neck is unusual for Abu Salabikh, and predominantly ED II in the Diyala region (e.g. Delougaz, 1952 : C.515.371). It also occurs on ajar from Kish (Mackay, 1929: PI. XLVII no. 22) from a grave that has indications of being earlier than most on the A cemetery. Plain handles, as we hope to demonstrate, are not in themselves chronologically significant. This Abu Salabikh jar is not out of keeping with the date suggested above for Level II of the Area A building. Area E 5. AbS 1299. Shoulder only. Pr?s. ht. 12?? cm, max. pr?s, width 34-0 cm. Red ware, medium coarse. Incised decoration. Position of smallest fragment conjectural. Context: fill of Room 61, dated to Level IB of Area E (Postgate, 1977 : 283). The incised design seems to represent an aquatic scene, perhaps with nets. The figure on the handle is undoubtedly human, but unfortunately not sufficiently preserved to determine the sex. Naturalistic scenes are atypical for ED III, and, as pointed out by Delougaz, more at home on scarlet-ware jars. A fragment of an ED II jar at Khafajah has incised fish (ibid. PI. 71a), and the same occurs at Abu Salabikh in Level II of Area E.e Another feature of No. 5 which is more typical of an earlier period is the standing notched ridge below the neck. This is common on ED I jars in the Diyala region (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 42), and occurs again on no. 40 (see below) from Abu Salabikh. A cylinder seal was found in the same stratigraphie context as No. 5 (Postgate, 1977 : PI. XXXIVb). 6. AbS 530. Incomplete. Ht. 10 o cm, rim di. 4-0 cm, base di. 50 cm. Incised decoration. Context : a cut in Rooms 54 and 55, the surface of which had been eroded (Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : PI. XXVb, p. 148, fig. 7 no. 4). The only example so far excavated at Abu Salabikh of a miniature type of upright-handled jar common at Kish (Mackay, 1929; PI. XLVIII no. 7) and in the Diyala region (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 156), where they are predominantly Houses 2 at Khafajah and " proto-imperial " at Tell Asmar. This would accord well with the post-Level iA date that must be assigned to the Abu Salabikh one. 7. 6G154193. Partial. Pr?s. ht. 24-4 cm, rim di. 11 ?6 cm, max. width 26-2 cm.

(Delougaz, 1952 : C.526.47id). It is similar to the Abu Salabikh specimen in general aspect too, and came from Houses 1 or above, that is an ED IIIB level. The neck decoration also occurs at Kish (Mackay, 1929: PI. XLVIII no. 23). The Eastern Houses 9? AbS 903. Rim and neck. Pr?s. ht. 8*8 cm, rim di. 16-4 cm., Medium-fine pink clay.

Two upright-handled jars from Khafajah have naturalistic designs (Delougaz, 1952 : 88). One, from Houses 3, the earliest ED III level, had a " shrine ", a lion, apparently in a net, and another predatory animal attacking a goat which is feeding from an extension of the pinnate motif on the handle, providing evidence that this motif at least sometimes represents a plant (ibid. : Pis. 8ob, 85b, 139a). The second jar is from Houses 2 (ibid. : 88), and, like the Abu Salabikh example, shows human figures, fish, and also a bird and boar which one man is spearing from the boat (ibid.: PI. 80c).</page><page sequence="7">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 53 10 cm ?-_u~--^ Fig. 2.</page><page sequence="8">54 JANE MOON Lower body scraped inside. Added base. Context : effectively unstratified, from surface levels above the surviving occupation of the area, which is partly dated to ED II (Postgate, 1977 : 285-288). Both jars are fragmentary, and represent two of the most common handle types found at Abu Salabikh. That of No. 9 is incised with a herringbone pattern, well paralleled in the Diyala region (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 79c) and fairly common at the beginning of ED III there (ibid. : 89).7 The splayed collar-rim of No. 9 is typical at Abu Salabikh, and occurs at Khafajah and Tell Asmar in modified form, though there are no stratified examples (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 871, 1), and at Kish (Mackay, 1929: PI. XLV no. 13/6). ib. Detached handles found in non-burial context The evident durability of upright handles that have become detached from their jars requires that they be regarded strictly as a terminus ante quern for levels in which they are found.

Applied brow- band. Shoulder incised. Context : floor of Room 4, therefore Level II. With its human features and applied "eyebrows" suggesting an ED III date this handle does not accord very well with the observations made about Room 2 of this level (see above p. 50). . 12. 5121:369. Upright handle. Solid. Pr?s. ht. 40 cm, max. pr?s, width 3-9 cm. Medium-coarse red clay, cream surface. Undulating scraped line. Context : a pit west of Room 4, so Level II. The scribbled design made with a stick or other blunt instrument is not reported from the Diyala region as a handle pattern, but is found on the bodies of upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes of early and middle ED III date at Khafajah (Delougaz, 1952 : C.526.471C, C.365.8iod). 13. AbS 1308. Upright handle. Solid. Pr?s. ht. 59 cm, max. width 6?? cm. Scraped undulating line. Context : a pit in Room 1, Level II. 14. AbS 888. Upright handle. Solid, fastened inside vessel. Pr?s. ht. 6-3 cm, max. width 7-0 cm. Medium-fine buflf clay. Incised decoration. Context : upper fill of Grave 26. May post-date Rooms 4 and 5, or may come from an earlier level disturbed by the digging of the grave. Although the cross design is found on some of the Diyala ED II handles, it occurs later too (Delougaz, 1952 : 0.526.4716, 6.516.471b). The latter pattern is found on an unstratified handle from Khafajah (ibid. : PI. 86 f.), and also occurs at Kish (Mackay, 1929 : PI. XLVIII no. 19). All other handles found on Area A are surface finds, and demonstrate well the variety of types that were made. 15. AbS 1393. Upright handle. Hollow, broken. Pr?s. ht. 80 cm, max. width 55 cm. Reddish clay, greenish surface out. Incised decoration. x6. AbS 887. Upright handle. Broken. Probably solid. Pr?s. ht. 4-5 cm, max. width 7-7 cm. Green and overfired. Incised decoration. Punched dots. The punched holes are normally restricted to the human type of handle. 17. AbS 889. Upright handle, probably hollow, and fragment of jar shoulder, through which handle attached. Pr?s. ht. of handle 5 ? 7 cm, max. width 6 ? 7 cm. Medium-fine red clay, buff surface. Incised decoration. This is a much more archaic looking specimen. The bump at the top occurs on at least one ED II upright-handled jar in the Diyala region (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 76b), which has the same ladder pattern on the shoulder as No. 14 above. Area E During the 1978 season, a few handles were found in the deep sounding in square 6G 64b. From batch 86, Level Id, came a large, coarse, square handle, about 70 cm across, with the 7 Delougaz remarked that this device is also used on model animals, presumably to represent wool or hair (Delougaz, 1952: 93). Like many upright handle motifs the herringbone occurs on model chariots, where it could again be hide or fleece (e.g. Mackay, 1929: PI. XLVI nos. 5, 7). Perhaps it could be woollen clothing on the handles. An unprovenanced model chariot in the Ashmolean Museum (1975.326) has herringbone covering the front, and four pinnate motifs forming the spokes of the wheels. The one illustrated by Mackay also has a St. Andrew's cross over the front, perhaps as leather straps.</page><page sequence="9">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 55 10 cm Fig. 3?</page><page sequence="10">50 JANE MOON familiar incised St. Andrew's cross formed of parallel lines, exactly like a handle illustrated by Delougaz (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 86d), except with an extra pair of horizontal lines through the centre. Batches 2718, Level II, and 2733, Level Il/lII each produced a solid, square handle with horizontal scribbling as on No. 13 above. That from 2718 was no less than 10 cm wide, larger than any handle illustrated here, and of similar proportions to the large ED I upright-handled jar from Tell Asmar (see above p. 48). These levels of the Area E sounding are pre-ED III. The earliest handles for which illustrations are available as yet are as follows. 18. AbS 717. Upright handle, broken.

The rather baroque form of female handle is found at many sites: Khafajah (Delougaz, 1952: PI. 87p), Tell 'Uqair,8 Kish (Mackay, 1929 : PI. XLV) and Tell Asmar, where it is dated to the very end of the Early Dynastic period (Delougaz, 1952 : PI. 871, m, n). The latter example is equipped with nostrils, or perhaps nose rings. The rest of the detached handles from Area E date to post-Level IA, or cannot be safely dated earlier. 24. AbS 710. Upright handle. Solid. Pr?s. ht. 6?? cm, max. width 70 cm. Red clay, buff surface.

The flattened rim, lozenge-patterned shoulder and anthropomorphic handle are all strongly reminiscent of the Kish jars from the A cemetery (Mackay, 1929 : PI. XLVIII no. 24). No jar from the Diyala region offers such close parallels, but the high base, swept-back handle touching the rim, and short shoulder all argue for an ED IIIB date. 32. AbS. 1216. Nearly complete.

Context: Grave 84 (Postgate, 1977 : PI. XXXId). Associated with a stemmed dish (No. 54 below). Combing is generally a late feature at Khafajah and Tell Asmar (Delougaz, 1952 : p. 87). Double registers of shoulder design are also found at Kish (Mackay 1929 : PL XLVIII no. 2). The unusual rim also occurs on No. 40 below. 33? AbS 1397. Nearly complete.

Sole ceramic survivor of this grave. It is the largest upright-handled jar we have yet encountered. The handle is usual enough?Diyala parallels range from Houses 2 through to Late Agade (Delougaz, 1952: PI. 87a, b, C.526-47ia), but the shoulder is unfamiliar. In apparent discord with the ED IIIB-or-later date indicated for the handle, the rim is of the collar type, with an ED II to IIIA range in the Diyala region (ibid. : PI. 77, p. 84). The general shape of the jar supports a date not later than ED IIIA. Area E 34. AbS 472. Complete. Ht. 47-5 cm, rim di. 21-2 cm, base di. 16*5 cm. Incised decoration. Context: Grave 1. Level IB/IC (Postgate and Moorey, 1976: p. 148, Fig. 7, no. 1). Associated with two stemmed dishes (Nos. 68 and 69 below). As remarked above (No. 14), the simple cross on the handle is not necessarily indicative of a pre-ED III date, especially when the handle itself is not of the small, square type. The jar's collar rim, short, rounded shoulder and general body shape suggest the same early ED III date as does No. 33 above. The lozenge-shape pattern on the shoulder does not seem to have any published parallels. The rest of the Area E graves discussed here were dug from above the present surface level. 35. AbS 1420. Base incomplete. Ht. 310 cm, rim di. 17-2 cm, base di. c. 17-0 cm. Medium-coarse bufT clay, cream surface. Incised decoration. Context: Grave 100. (Postgate, 1977: p. 285, PI. 33b). Associated with a stemmed dish (No. 77 below). The nearest similar shape to this entirely unusual jar is provided by a wide-mouthed jar from Grave 162, of Houses 2, at Khafajah (Delougaz, 1952 : C.525.352). For the shape and size of the handle we can offer no parallels, though its pattern is unremarkable. 36. AbS 1101. Incomplete. Ht. 43-5 cm, rim di. 17-4 cm, base di. ?r. 17-0 cm. Fine buff clay, fine greenish surface. Well-made. Decoration incised with eight-toothed comb. Context: Grave 71/73. Associated with a stemmed dish (No. 75 below). The handle design is by now thoroughly familiar, but this is the only tall, hollow handle that has it. The splayed rim is like No. 9 above. The combing on the shoulder may be taken to indicate a later date than early ED IIIA.</page><page sequence="15">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 6l 10 cm Fig. 7.</page><page sequence="16">62 JANE MOON 37.

Pottery in this grave therefore post-dates Nos. 25, 26 and 28 above. Associations include stemmed dish (No. 74 below, see Postgate and Moorey, 1976: PI. XXVb, XXIIIb).

Although the exact level from which the grave was dug cannot be ascertained, the comparative depth of the deposit means that it is almost certainly earlier than other graves from the same area discussed below. The pottery assemblage in the grave includes a spouted jar of a type the excavators considered diagnostically earlier, perhaps ED II (ibid. : 291). The small handle is completely plain, and its shape and position low on the shoulder are most similar to ED II upright-handled jars from Khafajah (Delougaz, 1952 : C.515.371). The low, almost non-existent ring-base is a feature commonly found on pottery of ED I or II in the Diyala region, but not later though it occurs at least once in an ED III level at Abu Salabikh (No. 39 below). An ED II upright-handled jar from Khafajah is about the same size, and has the same scribbling round the shoulder and the featureless handle, but the rim is of the collar type and the handle large and hollow (Delougaz, 1952 : C.506.371). 39. AbS 1018. Jar with single handle. Incomplete. Ht. 19-16 cm, rim di. c. ???? cm, base di. 6-4 cm. Medium-fine red clay. Incised decoration. Pinched base.

Context: Grave 32, dug into Room 101 and aligned with the walls, which suggests that inhumation took place before their total destruction. Both jars display a disheartening mixture of features to compare with the Diyala chronology. They were associated with a stemmed dish (No. 79 below). No. 39 has a low ring-base, which, as we have just seen, is a pre-ED III feature. The splayed collar rim, on the other hand, is only found in levels dated to Houses 3 at Khafajah. The handle is missing, but it must have been hollow as the emplacement is circular. The rudimentary shoulder-rib and the scratching on the shoulder are more typical of late ED IIIB (Delougaz, 1952 : fi.516.371a, b). No. 40 has a neck-ridge of the type more frequently associated with ED I vessels (see above p. 48), but the rest of the features support the ED III date that must be assigned to this grave ; the flat rim with under-ridge is as on No. 32 above, and the handle is of the human type, placed close to the rim. 41? 6G 52:3. Fragmentary. Rim and base missing. Pr?s. ht. 24 3 cm, max. width c. 34*0 cm. Handle decorated with fine two-toothed comb. Incised decoration too. Context: Grave 17, dug from a level above the present surface of the mound. Found with a stemmed dish (No. 73) below). Both handle and shoulder decoration are typical for Abu Salabikh. Bulldozer Cut A bulldozer working on irrigation ditching at the base of the eastern side of the mound unearthed Grave 110, that cannot be stratigraphically linked to the areas under controlled excavation. A number of pots were salvaged, including this upright-handled jar. 42. AbS 1455. Incomplete. Ht. 46-6 cm, rim di. 19 o cm, base di. 16 5 cm. Pink clay, white surface. Deeply incised decoration. In spite of the fragmentary condition in which the bulldozer had left it, this is the most handsome jar of its kind found at Abu Salabikh. It is unfortunately not possible to show convincingly in drawing or photograph most of the characteristics that single out this jar. The fabric was a delicate, well-levigated pink clay, with cream slip, and the shape was evenly and carefully finished. The peculiar thinness of the vessel walls can perhaps be detected from the drawing. The design on the shoulder, though not apparently strikingly different from others discussed here, is in fact much more deeply and carefully incised, with greater attention to symmetry. The shoulder-rib is also carefully executed and evenly notched.</page><page sequence="17">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 63 10 cm Fig. 8. 10 cm</page><page sequence="18">64 JANE MOON This jar is definitely different from those described so far. On account of the bevelled rim, low, solid handle with the same design as those from Level II of Area A, and relatively low ring base, the distinction may be because it is earlier. Of course, there are other possibilities, but the suggestion is slightly supported by the existence of a jar-fragment from Level IV of the 1963 deep sounding on Area A. This has a very similar deep-cut pattern. 1 d. Detached handles found in graves In the case of disturbed graves there is, of course, no way of knowing whether a handle which is found without its jar is merely a victim of the disturbance or was placed in the grave as an offering in its own right. A broken-off figurine that Woolley considered may have been a handle was found in a grave at Ur, one of the only two upright-handled jars found on that site (Woolley, 1934 : 388, PI. 187). Area A 43?

Pr?s. ht. 6-5 cm, max. width 8-2 cm. Red clay, buff surface. Incised decoration. Context: Grave 35, Room 4 of Area A. (Postgate, 1977: 140). These handles, which are similar to each other, were found with a stemmed dish (No. 66 below). There is a possibility that at least one of them was fixed to ajar when left in the grave, for the remains of a vessel with collar-rim and hatched triangles on the shoulder was found in the destroyed area of Graves 28 and 31, which merge with Grave 35. Area E 45. AbS 1141. Upright handle. Solid. Pr?s. ht. 12 ?? cm, max. width 6?? cm. Red clay, white surface. Plastic features and applied browband. Punched dots.

Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : 148 fig. 7 no. 10), which occur at Kish (Mackay, 1925, 1929: Type E, PI. XIV, LII), but not in the Diyala region. The combing, and elaborate attention to the face of this handle indicating jewellery (?) suggest a late ED III date. Eastern Houses 46. AbS 1020. Upright handle. Hollow.

Hollow: pinched together at top. Pr?s. ht. 6-3 cm, max. width 5 ? 1 cm. Reddish clay, greenish outer surface. Plastic features. Incised decoration. Context : Grave 51, which is dug from an eroded level, cutting the east wall of Room 10. Found with a footed jar which has a rather low base, and is thought to be an earlier form of the type (Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : 293). No. 47 combines human and geometric representations. le. Sherds of upright-handled jars Apart from the upright-handled jars or parts of them mentioned above, 112 more small fragments from the same levels were examined. These did not yield any further useful information concerning chronology, but included five more examples of herringbone pattern on the shoulder, four more of a single scribbled line, and nine more of hatched triangles. It was assumed for this purpose ihat all incised shoulder sherds belonged to upright-handled jars, as no other kind of the same proportions has yet been found with incised decoration at Abu Salabikh. 2. Stemmed dishes There was no positive evidence for stemmed dishes of the type that is ED II in the Diyala region (Delougaz, 1952 : 85). The deep sounding on Area E yielded rim fragments which were all of a fairly small, simple shape (cf. No. 72 below), and one or two were of grey ware. The stemmed dishes discussed below are all of the elaborate ED III type, which was not found below Level II.</page><page sequence="19">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 65 10 cm Fig. 9? 2a.

Originally there were at least ten stemmed dishes from this grave. They were found very close to the surface, and had suffered much from salt, and the only other ceramic offering that survived with them was a crushed red jar. In the Diyala region small undecorated stemmed dishes are intermediate between the early long ones and the elaborate ED III type (Delougaz, 1952 : 85, 0.364.8103, C.364.810b, C.365.810a). They do, however, turn up throughout the ED III levels too (ibid. : C.363-8ioa, C.363.810b) and are also found at Kish (Mackay, 1929 : PI. XLIX nos. 7, 8, 11, 14). There is no question of Grave 93 being any earlier than late ED IIIA.</page><page sequence="21">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 67 65 wm? 66 1_I 10 cm Fig. 11.</page><page sequence="22">68 JANE MOON 62.

Has two long slits in the stem, and is a simple version of a type which can be very ornate indeed, as for instance at Ur (Woolley, 1934 : PI. 180b). ED III stemmed dishes from the Diyala region all appear to be much shorter than No. 62, but at least one was in fact about the same height and proportion: Kh VIII 189 (Delougaz, Hill and Lloyd, 1942 : PI. 62a, Delougaz, 1952 : 0.365.810b) is 30-7 cm high.

Scraped line around rim. Context : considered to belong with Grave 28, but there is also a possibility that it really came from Grave 31, for the two graves were partly confused. The uncertainty of context is unfortunate because Grave 28 provides some interesting associated pottery : there was a four-piece set (Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : 151, 163, 149 figs. 8 nos. 16-19), and a long-necked jar (cf. Postgate and Moorey, 1976 : 149 fig. 8 no. 15), both of which types occur in Grave 1, which produced the upright-handled jar No. 34 above and stemmed dishes Nos. 68 and 69 below. No. 63 here has in the stem slits outlined with incised lines. This may be intended to represent recessing round a doorway (cf. Amiet, 1961 : PI. 11 nos. 200, 203a).

An un-numbered fragment from Ur, now in the British Museum bears a frieze of ducks, dogs, and other creatures. 2c. Sherds of Stemmed dishes From a study of the 267 sherds of stemmed dishes recovered among the material under considera- tion, it is clear that base decoration divides into five main types.12 The most common (sixteen examples) is an apparently combed pattern of triangles that is in fact produced by the use of an instrument with a single point. There were ten examples of the same pattern actually done with a comb, eight examples of hatched triangles, five examples of a plain criss-cross design, and four of double-registered patterns. Evidence of numbers of holes in various parts of the vessel proved impossible to collect from small fragments. No more instances of long windows in stems were noted, but these might easily have been mistaken for pieces of hollow stand. Three fragments of stems decorated with incision were found. The most common form of rim bore notches around both edges : there were thirty sherds like that, and seventeen the same but with a scraped wavy line on top of the rim. Sixteen rims with no notching were recorded, and six of those with notches had a wavy line around the depression between the rims. None of the above characteristics could be seen to have any chronological significance, nor would the quantity of sherds permit any real conclusions of that sort to be drawn anyway. The type of stemmed dish with long windows in the stem seems confined to surface graves. As already mentioned, rim fragments from the deep sounding were all of the simple type. Chronological results Nearly all the Abu Salabikh material under consideration here is ED III, most of ED IIIA. Obviously within such limits the emergence of single type fossils for sub-divisions of the period cannot be expected : rather one must hope for clustering of particular attributes, such as rim style, decoration, or combinations of recognizable characteristics. The relevant Abu Salabikh pottery does not, in conclusion, offer a sufficient quantity of safely stratified material to do this, and the comparative examples from other sites do not provide much support. The overwhelmingly obvious feature of ED IIIA upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes is their variability : eloquent warning not to depend for chronological purposes on a small sample. However, the corpus as a whole does provoke a few tentative suggestions. Flat, out-turned rims on upright-handled jars are only found in graves cut from above surface at Abu Salabikh, and apart from equivocal fragments they do not occur at Khafajah below Houses 2 (see above p. 48). Yet this is the commonest type of rim on jars from the A cemetery at Kish. If one is not to draw conclusions from small or unstratified samples then no conclusions at all can be drawn about ED IIIB pottery, for there is so little of it excavated. But such shreds of evidence that do exist support Delougaz's opinion that the A cemetery is predominantly latest ED IIIB, or " proto-imperial " as he termed it (Delougaz, 1952 : 146). To the vexed subject of anthropomorphic handles we cannot add much of profit, for all sorts of handles abounded throughout the excavated levels at Abu Salabikh. A single disembodied handle of the most " developed " kind occurred as early as 12 It was assumed that there is not a bowl type with rim indistinguishable from that of a stemmed dish.</page><page sequence="27">SOME NEW EARLY DYNASTIC POTTERY FROM ABU SALABIKH 73 Level IB (No. 20) but no jars that were early, stratigraphically or on stylistic analogy, possessed a full face. Just a nose seems to be a very enduring feature. Evidence from other sites within and without Mesopotamia (Mari, Susa, 'Uqair, etc.) militates strongly against Whelan's general implication that " goddess " handles are a regional variation at Kish.13 The shape and position of the handle seems to be more informative in this respect than its decoration. Early upright-handled jars have small, squarish handles set low on the shoulder, in much the same position as wing lugs were. As time went on they were affixed close to the base of the neck and became more elongated, finally touching the rim. Hollow handles were at their most popular during ED IIIA, the whole length of the shoulder sometimes being used to affix them. Jar shoulders were short at the beginning and end of the period in which upright- handled jars were popular, and longest in the middle. Little can be said about the shoulder designs on the Abu Salabikh pots : the hatched triangle is almost the only design that repeats itself. There is slight evidence, on Diyala analogy, that a single scribbled line does not occur after ED IIIA. Most upright-handled jars have a shoulder rib, usually with notches. General observation of Abu Salabikh sherds ranging from ED I to ED III suggests that close, more even notching is earlier than the more widely spaced, careless variety. Workmanship must have varied among individual craftsmen, as did no doubt other features of manufacture and decoration. In general, however, the jars from surface cuts and graves at Abu Salabikh are more uneven, and the decoration shallower and more haphazard than on those from lower levels. This is in keeping with Delougaz's description of the " pro to-imperial "jars from the Diyala region as being of* inferior workmanship " (Delougaz, 1952 : 87). The ring bases are usually made from coarser clay and added afterwards. Pre-ED III jars from the Diyala region tend to have lower bases, the centre of the bottom of the pot barely lifted from the ground (ibid. : C.526.371a). The Abu Salabikh jars that could be very early ED IIIA or even earlier are the same. This characteristic is not invariable, but does apply to other kinds of jars too, such as spouted ones (Postgate, 1977 : 290 fig. 5 nos, 4, 7 and 88). The pedestal base of the " proto- imperial " period in the Diyala region, and also known at Kish, has not yet occurred at Abu Salabikh. The early, elongated form of the stemmed dish as excavated from the ED II levels at Khafajah and Tell Asmar has not been found on any other site, as far as we are aware, though one short plain one, of the type that was introduced towards the end of the period seems to have pre-ED III associations at Tell 'Uqair.14 Rim sherds of stemmed dishes from pre-ED III levels of the sounding at Abu Salabikh were all of the plain un-notched type, and small. In discussing the development of the stemmed dish in the Diyala region Delougaz did not note any distinction between those of ED IIIA and those of ED IIIB 13 The devices used on the handles to suggest human features have a very wide currency. Clay figurines from Altin Tepe in southern Turkmenia, which date to the late third millennium b.c. have eyebrows of punched dots, applied discs and coils to represent hair, incised pubic triangles just like some of the Kish jars, and applied breasts with pinnate motifs incised between them (State Hermi- tage Museum, Leningrad). 14 Uq. 523, Iraq Museum.</page><page sequence="28">74 JANE MOON (Delougaz, 1952 : 85, 90-91). As far as is known Abu Salabikh does not have any stratified ED IIIB deposits, but it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that some of the surface graves may be so dated (for instance grave 95). The stemmed dishes found in all the graves were very varied, and did not suggest any stylistic groupings. Conclusion As yet, then, we cannot improve on Moorey's observation that " so far as they may at present be checked stratigraphically at Abu Salabikh, Delougaz's argu- ments . . . are well-sustained" (Postgate and Moorey, 1976: 163). Be that as it may, one is still faced with the intrinsic incongruity of applying a system based on building levels at one group of sites in north-east Mesopotamia to the whole country and beyond. For even among the Diyala sites themselves discrepancies were noted : private house levels at Tell Asmar, reflecting the processes of building, decay, and rebuilding, defied strict division into the same phases as those observed at Khafajah. The underlying problem to the whole approach was pointed out long ago by Childe : " Chronological labels were never meant to be attached to slices of clock- time. They are applicable only to assemblages of archaeological phenomena repeatedly associated together. They denote simply the position of such assemblages in a local sequence and their relationship to other assemblages in the same sequence " (Childe, 1956: 91-92). These remarks were intended to apply to prehistoric assemblages, but for the purposes of dating even the late Early Dynastic period must be treated as prehistoric, for such written evidence as is presently available is not rich enough to comment on the problems being considered here. The term " ED II " has been avoided except when writing of the Diyala sites and quoting, directly or indirectly, for comparable groups of objects have yet to be demonstrated anywhere else (see Moorey, 1979: 118). Attempts to extrapolate an ED II phase from a single type of object have resulted in confusion, for instance at Tell Chuera, where much reliance is placed on the stylistic dating of statues (K?hne, 1976: 58). For all the apparent desirability of new excavated material Near Eastern archaeologists sometimes seem to be rather nonplussed by its appearance, for it adds complexity to a picture that once appeared to be clear because it was an impoverished oversimplification. Under such circumstances, the similarities in pottery styles that existed in Mesopotamia in the third millennium are the more remarkable. They argue for a closely compatible development of at least these objects at different sites, and there- fore some kind of close relationship. It is the nature of this relationship that is elusive, and that we hope to explore more fully in a concluding article, by means of discussion of the geographical distribution of upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes.

Some resulting inconsistencies have been retained for the sake of accuracy. Many of the pots shown were incompletely preserved, and where reconstruction was possible in drawing (e.g. drawing both sides when only one was preserved) this was done. In the few cases where any considerable conjecture is a factor in the end result, a note appears in the catalogue. Sections for detached handles are not shown in solid black as they are strictly " side-views ", not profiles, the latter often being impossible to measure without sawing the handle in half. Height is taken from the existing top of the vessel when it is standing on its base. Rim diameter is measured across the highest points of the mouth. A bevelled-ledge rim would therefore be measured from inner edges, a flat topped rim from outer edges, if these are higher. Base diameter is measured across the widest place where two points of the base touch the ground as the vessel stands. (All the vessels illustrated here have ring bases.) References Amiet, P., 1961.
