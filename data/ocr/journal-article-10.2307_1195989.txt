<plain_text><page sequence="1">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY MARTIN DIBELIUS Heidelberg, Germany IN GERMANY, as elsewhere, scientific interpretation of Jesus is determined by two considerations. Of first im- portance is the understanding of the sources, that is, knowledge of the results achieved by modern methods of re- search in the study of the gospels and other texts bearing on the subject. Then there is also the point of view by which the in- terpreter himself is motivated in his work. Even though freely admitting the presence of this second interest one does not thereby yield to a "theological presupposition" but merely states a limitation which not only restricts but inspires all sci- entific knowledge in the historical field. Unquestionably it is one of the scholar's tasks so to interpret the work of a historical person as to make it intelligible. In so doing one must pro- nounce an opinion regarding it, and this opinion will be one's personal attainment conditioned by one's individuality and the age in which one lives. In a dominant idea of this sort the per- sonality of the individual scholar will appear, even when he has taken the utmost possible care to scrutinize texts in an un- biased manner and with scientific purpose. Otherwise he would remain a mere collector of data and of narrative statistics but never could rise to the plane of historical interpretation. Moreover, interpretation of Jesus involves also a theological task. Its aim is to exhibit in Jesus the one who became for hu- manity the Christ, the deliverer, the savior. This is a task which the historian may eschew. Also, it may be performed on the basis of another's historical interpretation but without any distinctively scientific attainments. But when both the his- torical and the theological quests are undertaken together, it is 179</page><page sequence="2">18o THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION necessary to distinguish the areas within which each quest can be achieved. One can undertake to show by scientific methods why the movement begun by Jesus did not cease with his death on the cross, but one cannot adduce scientific proof for the opin- ion that through Jesus' coming the final word of God was spoken to mankind. Faith alone discerns and affirms this to be the true significance of that brief temporal incident in the insignificant land of Palestine. I Failure to distinguish between the scientific task and the function of faith was just the defect that discredited the method of presenting the life of Jesus still current in Germany even at the beginning of the present century. There were books marked by great sincerity, and of considerable significance, that were doomed to this fate. By reading the treatises about Jesus writ- ten by Paul Wilhelm Schmidt (1899), Oskar Holtzmann (1901), Wilhelm Bousset (1904), and Wilhelm Heitmiiller (1913), one can obtain a picture of their type. Consciously or unconsciously these writers sought to accomplish two things, namely, to pre- sent the life of Jesus the man, and with this presentation to satisfy also the demands of faith. These labors yielded impor- tant results in the field of source criticism and historical minded- ness. They brought to light again numerous words and deeds of Jesus. But, for the history of theology, perhaps the most im- portant consequences were negative. The work of these schol- ars established the fact that by the use of a serious historical exposition one cannot do justice to Christianity's claims as a religion of revelation. Proceeding from this conclusion, one may resign one's self to historical research and decisively refrain from all theological inquiry. One may, however, now pass on to this task with new earnestness and, with a new formulation of the problem, deliberately undertake its solution. But a blissful neglect of the distinction between the historical and the theo- logical tasks is no longer in conformity with the new position. This changed situation was brought about not merely by the</page><page sequence="3">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 181 new statement of method. Definite developments in research have also contributed to the result. Most German lives of Jesus written since the age of the Enlightenment were dominated by the conviction that they portrayed the life of one who was good and great and precious for humanity. The atmosphere and lan- guage of these interpretations were designed to set Jesus among the great leaders of humanity, perhaps among "Religious Edu- cators," as the series is called in which the essay of Arnold Meyer appeared; or among the "Immortals," the title of the series inaugurated by Bultmann's Jesus, though it is a book with a quite different purpose. This evaluation of Jesus, as a mighty hero significant for the present, was vitiated by the discovery that the preaching of Jesus is eschatological in char- acter and so is not concerned with the world and its future, but with its end and the Kingdom of God in an age soon to come. This view was sketchily presented as early as 1896 in Johannes Weiss's Die Predigt Jesu vom Reiche Gottes; and it was set forth most impressively, as well as most one-sidedly, in Albert Schweitzer's history of study on the life of Jesus, Von Reimarus zu Wrede (19o6). Thus the significance of Jesus' work for the present was diminished. He had not been concerned with this world and had not realized any human ideals. Therefore his person and work had to be evaluated in terms of some imagery other than that of a hero of human history. All work on problems connected with the life of Jesus was fundamentally affected by the results of more recent research in the criticism of gospel sources. Two tendencies were in evi- dence, namely, a growing skepticism regarding the outline of Jesus' career as presented in the gospels, and the formulation of a new principle for research in the history of tradition. With the working out of the two-source theory at the end of the nineteenth century, the criticism of the sources seemed to have reached a measure of finality. But this confidence was soon lost, immediately one yielded to the temptation to make the oldest gospel, that of Mark, normative, as the earliest and</page><page sequence="4">182 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION therefore the best biography of Jesus. It was Wilhelm Wrede especially who, in his Messiasgeheimnis, proved even the Gos- pel of Mark to be a product of faith. In his opinion even Mark is dominated by a religious tendency which casts its long shadow over the original reminiscences of the disciples. But most con- spicuously is the entire structure, the whole fabric of events, conditioned throughout by the author's point of view rather than by fidelity to reports and reminiscences. These and kin- dred conclusions furnished the starting-point for the work of the so-called formgeschichtliche school, which asked, "How could it have been otherwise? How could one conceive of the rise of the gospels within Christian communities dominated by eschatological notions and expectations of the end of the world unless these communities depicted Jesus in accordance with the necessity of nourishing faith on faith?" If the rise of the oldest tradition is not the result of the interests of faith, then the existence of the tradition becomes wholly problematic. The "existence of tradition" was in general the slogan that characterized the works of the formgeschichtliche school-the writings of Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Schmidt, Martin Albert, and myself. For our concern was with what existed prior to the gospels, not only with their antecedent written sources but with the earliest form of narratives, sayings of Jesus, groups of sayings, parables, as these units of tradition in oral or written form had circulated in the early communities before becoming combined into anything like a book. The form of these units was not determined by the individuality of evangelists but by the unwritten laws effectual for the shaping of popular tradi- tion. The better one understands these laws the more confi- dently does one make any assertion about the earliest stratum of tradition. Thus the authenticity of a deed or a word of Jesus depends not so much upon the reliability of an evangelist as upon the appropriateness of the passage to that stratum which is proved by its form to have been the oldest. By this means we thought to relieve problems connected with the life of Jesus</page><page sequence="5">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 183 from that subjectivism which concerned itself primarily with weighing possibilities regarding the historicity of a word or deed of Jesus, and which in fact rendered a final decision in ac- cordance with the experience and judgment of men today. In accordance with this methodological principle, the aim of research could only be to recover individual sections of tradi- tion, rather than a connected sequence of passages. In the pas- sion story at most might such a continuous narrative be dis- cernible, for here the incidents occur in a developmental se- quence; and evidently even the oldest tradition had empha- sized a certain continuity underlying such topics as the betray- al, the arrest, the denial, the hearing before the high priest and the procurator, the crucifixion, and the burial. But, in the case of Jesus' activities, the formgeschichtliche method of research renounced the attempt to restore the original continuity of in- cidents, for all connecting links in the gospel narratives were taken to be the work of compilers-of the evangelists or their predecessors. In surrendering the chronological sequence of the gospels, one also abandoned the notion of a psychological development connected with the growth and activity of Jesus. In other words, one renounced the very item which a large num- ber of biographers of Jesus regarded as their chief task. They, by means of a sympathetic and imitative psychology, pene- trated into the inmost emotions by which Jesus was swayed, and drew conclusions about what he had thought of himself, what he had expected to accomplish, and what he had hoped his preaching would effect. The representatives of Formge- schichte had to admit that we know nothing about these ques- tions, because the oldest recoverable accounts had known noth- ing of and had not been concerned with these matters. The mosaic character of the traditions, so it was said, makes it im- possible for us to discover any consistent sequence and draw any conclusions regarding a development in Jesus. This conclusion harmonizes readily with the scientific situa- tion. For the scientific temper, at least in the historical field,</page><page sequence="6">184 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION was characterized by a tendency to abandon the older and highly prized psychology. The extensive and valuable work of German research on the life of Goethe, carried on by the past generation, is known even in foreign lands. This research aimed to obtain an understanding of the career of Goethe from numer- ous minor observations of a biographical sort, from letters, from expressions and sayings and contemporary reports. This pro- cedure was characteristic of the situation at the turn of the century. The inadequacy of the method is indicated by the criticism of the younger generation, which pointed out that Goethe cannot be adequately understood even by the use of his words. One may grasp the parts while the spiritual entity as a whole escapes. Under the influence of contemporary phi- losophy, particularly of the so-called phenomenological school,' there arose the demand to grasp intuitively a total view of the figure to be exhibited. Thus it was no longer proper to strive to understand a historical person by assembling individual bio- graphical details; but it was declared to be the primary duty of the biographer, assuming these individual items, to give them realistic meaning by means of an objective exhibition ("Exakt- vision"), and in this way grasp and graphically present his- torical phenomena. And it was in the study of Goethe, in the work of Friedrich Gundolf, that this method found its most striking and best-known application. By renouncing the use of individual incidental biographical details and the psycho- logical continuity reconstructed therefrom, Gundolf was able to realize a completeness of form in presentation such as the older method of treatment had never attained. On the other hand, the reader of these new books placed himself completely at the disposal of the author and was in no position to test in detail the accuracy of the picture. He was able to pass judg- ment only on the convincing power of the presentation, not on 1 Readers may recall, in this connection, the article by Julius Seelye Bixler, "Ger- man Phenomenology and Its Implications for Religion," Journal of Religion, IX (1929), 589-606.-EDITOR.</page><page sequence="7">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 185 its agreement with the sources. This fruitful method, which has decisively influenced the entire field of humanistic studies in Germany during the last decade, easily exposes the layman to the danger of ignoring the demand for accuracy. However, this procedure is in large measure justified by appropriately recog- nizing as we have done above that all knowledge is conditioned by the knower and that the range and accuracy of one's vision are limited to one's own capacities. In the field of ancient history especial importance had to be conceded to this new methodology. In studying the life of Goethe, the sources were everywhere so abundant that a pro- cedure calling for omission of biographical details constituted a genuine renunciation. But just because details in the life of an ancient person are so little known to us, one feels it necessary to gain an understanding of an ancient figure from his work and not from such individual facts as one is now able to reconstruct. Thus it is the empirical need that in this case constitutes the virtue of the method. Under such circumstances this new meth- od has been applied also to the interpretation of persons in ancient cultural history. Karl Reinhardt's book, Poseidonius, belongs in this class. This changed type of research, when its theological implica- tions emerged, had especial significance in the interpretation of early Christian persons. The new historical method asked questions about the figure of Paul as a whole-not so much about his malady, his ancestry, or even the circumstances of his conversion-but more especially about his total personality as this was exhibited in the writing of his letters. Nor was this information sought in the accidental and occasional features in the letters, but in the deeper unity of feeling common to all of them. Moreover, the new theology, particularly in the form given it by Karl Barth and his associates, seeks to recover the gospel preached by Paul, and not his biography. Its quest is for the content of the revelation and not for the circumstance under which the revelation occurred. All of these considerations are</page><page sequence="8">186 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION much more significant in respect to the life of Jesus. Not the outcome of his life, but its content, is essential. Moreover, it is not the succession and connection of events, which we are able to recount from the sources, but his message, that is funda- mental. How far specific deeds are connected with the message, and in how far, on the whole, we may venture to reconstruct the story of his activities, can be only an open question. Thus the progress of scientific criticism, as well as the ques- tion raised by the new theology, have necessarily exerted a de- cisive influence upon the portrait of Jesus in recent German literature. The degree to which this change is manifest natu- rally depends upon the extent to which the writers of the new books about Jesus show susceptibility for the new trends in re- search. In most cases authors who write a life of Jesus without a knowledge of the modern scientific debate allow influences from this source to escape them. Their methods are still those of the nineteenth century. Accordingly, German literature of a scientific and semi-scientific character exhibits at present quite varied types of interpretation of Jesus; and this phenomenon confirms again the fact that the personality of the author is no unessential factor in his interpretation of historical movements. II During the war two lives of Jesus appeared in German, each having typical significance. The one represents the older school, and the other points in the direction of the new developments. The former, a work of two compact volumes completed at the close of 1918, was written by the late Johannes Lepsius, director of the German Oriental Mission. This theologian, who at one time had been an assistant pastor in Jerusalem and had in- herited from that experience an interest in the geography of Palestine, also became well known beyond Germany through his activities on behalf of the Armenian situation. As early as 1897 he had resigned his pastoral office to engage in this work. The other book came from the pen of Professor Paul Wernle,</page><page sequence="9">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 187 of Basel, who earlier had given an interpretation of Jesus in his Anfdnge unserer Religion and who in his Die Quellen des Lebens Jesu in the series "Religionsgeschichtliche Volksbiicher" had presented to a wider circle of readers the critical prepara- tion necessary for any life of Jesus. Perhaps one may say that Lepsius wrote the last life of Jesus of the older type. That judgment is true, in so far as he employs the method of unrestrained psychological portraiture. But it is not correct if it is taken to mean that his work belongs simply to the older type of writing on the life of Jesus. Lepsius was an original personality who had distinctive views on many differ- ent points. His work was based on his own understanding of the sources, which was by no means the usual one. He took account of a primitive Mark and a primitive Matthew, and even also of a kind of primitive John written in Aramaic by the son of Zebedee but translated into Greek and worked over by the "Elder," John of Ephesus. Thus he also relied to a far greater extent than was customary in works of a more or less "critical" character upon the Gospel of John as an authentic source. Its statements were to be used and blended with the presentation furnished by the synoptic gospels. In this way Lepsius arrived at a highly "harmonistic" picture of Jesus' life, and the har- monization was attended by fundamental consequences for the historical reconstruction. In order to be fair to both infancy stories, Lepsius had to have Jesus born under respectable cir- cumstances, and he supposes that it is only because the ancient house of David at Bethlehem is not yet ready for her that Mary goes to the stable adjacent to the court of the house to give birth to her child. Also, after feeding the multitude Jesus de- livers the Johannine discourse on the heavenly bread, then chastises his opponents with the synoptic saying about the de- mand for a sign and with the pronouncement of woe on Chora- zin and Bethsaida. Of course this whole succession of incidents is recoverable only because the author everywhere ventures to effect a psy-</page><page sequence="10">188 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION chological reconstruction. Indeed, it becomes an instrument of invention. Lepsius draws conclusions about the thinking of Jesus and his opponents, and allows his own fancy so much lib- erty that his life of Jesus becomes a sort of free romance. Sus- pense and dramatic climax, features well known to be entirely lacking in the gospel pictures, are especially accentuated in Lepsius' life of Jesus. For example, Jesus is sought by Herod's horsemen, and he learns of their designs from a letter written by Chuza, the royal officer mentioned in the fourth chapter of John. Jesus tears himself away with difficulty from the sick that crowd around him, and escapes in a boat; scarcely has he embarked when the horsemen appear on the shore, where, curs- ing and raging, they are forced to recognize that they have ar- rived just a little too late. A stirring scene in which the German reader is reminded of the beginning of Schiller's Tell! Then follows immediately, according to Lepsius, the story of the miraculous draft of fishes reported in the twenty-first chapter of John, which is removed from the series of incidents following the resurrection and placed in the period of Jesus' public activity. The aim of this psychologizing is to make the life of Jesus in- telligible. Since the days when the older romantic lives of Jesus resulting from the Enlightenment were produced, German the- ology has grown especially skeptical of such attempts, and therefore has pursued the psychological portrayal of the sub- ject only in a moderate degree. In this respect Lepsius is more radical than all other theologians of his generation. If, conse- quently, he is less reproached than his predecessors, it is be- cause he deceives his readers with modern psychology. Where so much is clearly invented, the reader cannot be deceived; for one who has once looked into the gospels cannot believe that the narrative of Johannes Lepsius could be thus deduced even with approximate accuracy from the text of the gospels. There- fore he omits those hypothetical expressions, like "surely," "perhaps," "maybe," and "possibly," that characterized the earlier romantic biographies. As a matter of fact, he does not</page><page sequence="11">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 189 need to distinguish in any such fashion between supposition and deduction, for the entire interpretation rests on the right to conjecture. Since, however, intelligibility for the modern reader is the supreme norm in this interpretation, it necessarily follows that the miracle stories be presented in a special way. The resurrec- tion and appearances are, it is true, narrated as realities; but many other miracles are made intelligible in curious ways, and are toned down and rationalized. In this, Lepsius resembles the representatives of the Enlightenment, and that is all the more peculiar since in his ecclesiastical and theological position he himself was anything but a rationalist. But in the story of feeding the five thousand he makes Jesus furnish only a good example of brotherliness, imitation of which results in satisfy- ing the hunger of all; the swine were so frightened by the luna- tic that they rushed into the lake; in Cana Jesus dispensed "the wine which God himself had pressed out and caused to flow from all springs for his children"; and the wedding guests agree with him "that a worthy conversation can be pursued to the end with a drink of fresh water." Thus the conservative theologian arrives at most remarkable results, and transforms Jesus into a teacher of bourgeois hu- manistic ideals. That this is at all possible in such a book, shows clearly what r61le the general cultural attitude of the au- thor played in his interpretation of Jesus. For only on the basis of humanistic ideals, as taken for granted among humanistical- ly educated people of our day, is it at all conceivable that a scholar could make Jesus so nearly approach a Stoic and im- pute to him so Greek an ideal as the "worthy conversation" on a drink of water or wine. A year before the publication of Lepsius' life of Jesus, Wernle's Jesus appeared. It is not a life of Jesus but is essen- tially an interpretation of the gospels on the subjects of faith in God, man and the demands of God, and preaching regarding the coming kingdom of God. These subjects are presented with-</page><page sequence="12">190 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION out discussing a single question about the life of Jesus in the usual sense. Only in the last chapter, on "Jesus the Christ," is the problem of the messianic title and the messianic self-con- sciousness raised. The question is answered by distinguishing most clearly between what was expected of the Messiah in that age and what Jesus himself thought about his mission. This distinction leads to the fruitful recognition that the subject for discussion should be, not the "messianic self-consciousness" of Jesus, but the faith which Jesus entertained when he permitted himself to be called Messiah. Yet while Wernle is so candid- and it is in this section that his book points in the direction of the new methodology-the interpreter's personal concern for the question at issue is not to be obscured. He often empha- sizes-in my opinion too often and somewhat too subjectively -that one item is foreign or another is congenial to us. He thereby correctly expresses the conviction that at this point value and meaning, not only of the sources but also of the per- son of Jesus, are basal to his judgments. And by treating these questions of value in the final chapter, he thus safeguards in welcome fashion the interpretation given in the earlier chapters, where these problems are not introduced. Certainly even the presentation in the earlier chapters is not without constructive significance. But what he there aspires to is not the knowledge of a specific historical transaction but the understanding of the total phenomenon. In this formulation of purpose Wernle touches problems which fully anticipate the discussion of the following decade. Thus in his interpretation of the demand of God, the problem of the timelessness of the Sermon on the Mount is emphatically involved. The teaching of Jesus is not concerned with the overthrow of the law, but with making life simple, intense, severe, perfect. Jesus did not ask what is the best, most practical, or most ideal ethics, but what is important before God and his judgment, what is the perfect will of God who is supreme in eternity. And this eter- nal character of Jesus' demand insures for it timelessness.</page><page sequence="13">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 191 In what Wernle has to say about the content of Jesus' de- mand he is not in complete agreement with the treatment of the problem as presented in later theological discussion. When incidentally he mentions as "the most certain characteristic of Jesus' thought a decisive stern religious individualism," the tendency of the demand for specific matters is recognized; but the eschatological framework in which this demand stands is misunderstood. He thinks a community of Jesus' disciples is to be made ready for the coming kingdom-a purpose which lies be- yond the horizon of an individualistic inwardness. If the synthe- sis of Jesus' gospel yields nothing but the old formulas about love of God and one's brother, then it seems to me one over- looks the fact that there is a higher unity above the dualism of love for God and one's brother. It is curious how persistently in such combinations ideas from the Enlightenment continue to reassert themselves. If Jesus' gospel is synthesized about the idea of a community of disciples, then it seems to me one fails to observe that Jesus nowhere ever expresses a demand for brotherly love-that is, a humane charitable requirement- apart from his thought of God, but that a demand was made for love of enemies, readiness to forgive, submissiveness and help- ful service for neighbors, as consequences and expressions of one's relation with God. Wernle's entire book is supported by an unremitting earnest- ness which shuns no problem. He desires to hide nothing from his readers and to slight nothing. That is especially evident at one point. The last exclamation of Jesus, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is felt by Wernle to be a serious problem. The contrast between this "despair of the crucified one" and his triumphant confession before the Sanhedrin is given prominence, and Wernle questions whether this saying of Jesus signifies a "collapse of his hope for the Kingdom of God." The answer is that it is "rather a physical and mental impossibility" to cling to that hope in the moment of final agony. Thus this final cry signifies that Jesus with his last</page><page sequence="14">192 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ounce of strength still pursues the way "to the God whom he no longer understands." Certainly for a scholar with Wernle's heritage from literary criticism and knowledge of the history of religions another interpretation lay near at hand. One might affirm that Mark, had he understood this saying as a cry of despair, would either not have reported it at all or at least not without an explanation. One might have considered whether the later community had not at this point, as so often else- where, derived features of the passion story from the Old Tes- tament. The Twenty-second Psalm, which in other details was understood as a passion story, showed in its opening words the meaning of Jesus' last cry on the cross. Or, finally, one might ask whether, admitting the authenticity of the gospel narra- tive, the language of this Psalm could ever have signified de- spair on the lips of a pious Jew in the hour of death. Is not the language of this prayer from the Psalms an evidence of resigna- tion, characteristic of psalmist piety, which faces all suffering confidently before God? It is perhaps scientifically a defect that Wernle investigates none of these possibilities, but his dis- cussion of the problem demonstrates the honesty and courage of the author. III The books of Lepsius and Wernle represent two types of in- terpretation, one that of the past and the other that of the future. The characteristic trait of the former is a psychologiz- ing and rationalizing procedure, which results in the usual tendency toward a pronounced modernization. The character- istics of the latter are a restraint in respect to psychology and biographical reconstruction, and a disposition to present ex- position and interpretation from the point of view of Jesus' message. The older type of book seemed actually to be a scientific work, at least as written by Protestant theologians. Outside of theo- logical circles people even yet hold in high esteem the kind of life of Jesus that knows no distinction between history and ro-</page><page sequence="15">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 193 mance, that professes to rest on study of the sources, and yet- thanks to an imaginative interest nourished in reality from our modern cultural consciousness-knows all sorts of things about the desires and doings of Jesus-matters about which we know nothing. It declares itself to be historical and critical, yet it much deceives the reader regarding the chasm that lies between him and the subject. The past and its setting are visualized with all the devices of realism, but the result consists of impres- sions rather than actual knowledge. This type of life of Jesus holds too high a place in the affections of a wide circle of readers to permit its disappearance without further consideration from popular scientific literature. This situation must be kept in mind if one desires to estimate correctly Emil Ludwig's Der Menschensohn (" The Son of Man") and its commercial success. This German author, who is also well known in foreign lands, is a literary man rather than a poet: he has written three novels and one drama. He owes his fame to his biographies-Goethe, Napoleon, Bismarck, William II. Stylistically they are brilliant works, displaying vast knowl- edge of the sources and an uncanny power of making real certain situations that stimulate the author. His psychological fancy glows with especial brilliancy in dealing with personal data, like letters, diaries, and memoirs. He always views the past merely in terms of temperament, either the temperament of his subject or his own. When critics praise his biographies on the ground that they read like a drama, or that in them a section of history passes before the eye of the reader as in an ancient drama, these opinions reveal both the strength and the weakness of Emil Ludwig's books. For his exceptionally fruitful historical fancy is always in danger of passing from fact to fiction without mak- ing the reader aware of the transition. As a matter of fact, even in his interpretations of the recent past Ludwig has made fre- quent and copious reconstructions. His best-known example is his judgment about the youth of Emperor William, whose char- acter and fate Ludwig explains as largely the result of that</page><page sequence="16">194 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION physical defect with which the emperor was afflicted from birth. This was the shortening of his left arm. Ludwig concludes that this was the cause of the emperor's longing to be-or at least to appear-strong, hence his passion for display and also his mother's aversion toward German physicians. Again in the case of the Emperor Frederick's illness, this aversion had prompted her to trust implicitly the judgment of the English physician; and this confidence also had, as is well known, ex- erted an important influence on German politics in the year 1888. All of this is reconstructed attractively and often with serious arguments, but it is still only a reconstruction and as a whole is not capable of proof. Indeed, in many details it has to be immediately refuted in the light of recently published sources. I had to give an example of Ludwig's' method in handling a modern subject in order to explain two things. The first is the success which such an interpretation enjoys with the public at large. Der Menschensohn has now reached a circulation of thirty thousand; and the book on the former emperor, two hundred thousand. And, secondly, I wished to show the dan- gers to which this method is exposed when it attempts to re- cover the life of Jesus. For he is a subject regarding whom we have at our disposal no personal confessions, not even psycho- logical data. And one's ability to reproduce psychological real- ism becomes less powerful and effective the farther removed the subject of interpretation is in time, place, and type from the author. Ludwig does, indeed, endeavor to narrow this breach. He familiarizes himself and his readers in a very lively manner with the age and the world in which Jesus lived. In this he shows that he knows the sources and their historical interpretation. But he begins his picture with the youth of Jesus, about which one can find nothing in the sources. The method of Ludwig compels him to reconstruct the portrait of the youth from an intuitively perceived picture of the man. Thus the reader of this chapter on "Calling" becomes at the same time acquainted</page><page sequence="17">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 195 with the interpretation of Jesus which pervades the entire book. It is an idyllic interpretation. This is a Jesus whose face is turned toward the world: he takes part in festivities; he does not forbid marriage; he prefers gushing women like Mary of Bethany; in the presence of the adulteress he forgets his position as messianic judge and shows a particularly tender nature ca- pable of neither rebuke nor anger. The influence of a very well- known and once very famous type of life of Jesus is plainly seen in this portrait. It was Ernest Renan who put into literary circula- tion this picture of the gentle rabbi, the "pleasantest of men." These are the very traits which both authors, with annoying exaggeration, make prominent in Jesus. One reads in Renan, "He did not flee from pleasure, and he gladly went to marriage festivities"; and Ludwig says of the youthful Jesus, "He does not flee from festivities and women, and he makes merry with the guests." But all of this is true only of the youthful Jesus. For the dif- erence between this recent interpretation and that of Renan two generations ago is that Emil Ludwig attempts to show how, from this mild and joyously disposed youth, Jesus becomes one whose self-consciousness is to manifest itself in messianic, im- perative, high-claiming language. Ludwig has correctly seen that we know only one person who appears to have exerted an effective shaping influence upon the life of Jesus. This is John the Baptist. But Ludwig's method, as already described, now manifests itself again. In the correct observation that the ap- pearance of the Baptist had been of immeasurable significance for Jesus, Ludwig seeks a key to the entire life of Jesus. Thus it appears to Ludwig that every crisis which he imagines in the life of Jesus is caused by the activity and fate of the Baptist. It is the baptism that presents to Jesus the decisive call of God. The imprisonment of the Baptist summons him to take up the arrested work of John, indeed "in a milder tone" but yet in a manner of life which for Jesus is of unwonted severity and rigidity. Thus he goes to the wedding at Cana and displays his</page><page sequence="18">196 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION new character in the rebuff to his mother. And the Baptist's question addressed to Jesus from the prison becomes for him the suggestion of God which directs him to his proper messianic calling; from afar he feels "the enlightening gleam of assurance coming nearer." And as the Baptist "seemed mysteriously to crown him, he thus pointed out to him the way of suffering." The news of John's death, which Ludwig depicts with all the art of a rich and trained fancy, reveals to Jesus the kind of death for which he is destined. In this picture one is shown clearly the combination of history, which is set forth from the sources, with poetry, which wells up from fancy. This combination has its undeniable dangers. A reader con- fronted by anything so fascinating that purports to be derived from the texts may believe that the other items narrated by Ludwig are actually to be found in the sources. But such a work also has its charms. The psychological art of the author makes everything vivid; it is charming; and it seems as if the recon- struction of the poetic author might have been true to reality. For one acquainted with the gospels, it is all the more painful to observe that the total picture of Jesus, from which the indi- vidual features are fancifully derived, is so little in accord with the spirit of the message which Jesus actually preached. This is the price paid for exalting the deeds at the cost of the message. For this Jesus, who is more and more subject to external stimuli rather than to impulses from within himself, is not the masterful personality that speaks in the Sermon on the Mount; he is not the relentless critic of the commonplace life; he is not the wrath- ful prophet of woes against the Pharisees. And, indeed, Ludwig is compelled in such passages to give the text a new meaning. He represents Jesus in these sayings as slipping back into the "rough tone" of the Baptist. In the controversy over purifica- tion he who was "formerly so mild and cautious" is "no longer to be restrained." And of Matt. 11:25 Ludwig writes "the tender feeling of the son for the all-loving father has been thus transformed into arrogant ecstasy."</page><page sequence="19">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 197 The necessary cleft between the mild visionary of Renan's type and the relentless spokesman of the divine claims becomes all the greater in Ludwig's life of Jesus when the author under- takes a harmonistic treatment of the narratives and sayings in the Gospel of John. This result was to be expected especially in the story of the passion. Here Ludwig not only describes "the very old thin yellow face of Annas, wrinkled and colored like an old scroll of the law"; but also, by means of a new interpreta- tion, he discovers a trait of Pilate's character, when in a respect- ful moment "before the bearer of the Spirit" Pilate is permitted to say of Jesus in Latin, and hence is understood by his officers only, ecce homo. I have the suspicion that Ludwig is guided here less by the Greek text than by the memory of Napoleon's remark about Goethe, voila un homme! The Gospel of John is represented in Ludwig's book also by the discourse on bread, the conversation of the Baptist with the priests, and the story of the miracle at Cana. As a consequence a pronounced lack of harmony is present in this biography, and the author is com- pelled time and again to assume on Jesus' part either an evolu- tion or a sudden change of mood or a relapse, in order to justify the use of accounts so diverse in character. Accordingly, it is said that in Cana Jesus assumed "a mas- terly attitude, foreign to himself." From this imperious ges- ture arises the suggestion that the water is wine, for there is nothing else that happens at Cana. In this one sees, as in Lep- sius' life of Jesus, a kinship with a type of life which we sup- posed was long ago discredited. Manifestly Ludwig has no thought of taking these marvelous accounts as stories of mira- cles and of considering them to be unhistorical features such as are always found in a certain type of tradition. He uses ration- alistic criticism after the manner of the Enlightenment and does not understand the miracles to be simply stories but explains them as occurrences falsely described. The lengthy story of demon exorcism is understood, as is quite possible, to be an instance of healing by suggestion; but the guardian of the herd</page><page sequence="20">198 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of swine feeding in the vicinity gazes too intently upon the healing, and so a few of the swine fall from the precipitous rocks into the water! And Jesus' escape from the people of Nazareth can be accomplished in a wholly natural manner, since Jesus is here at home and knows every secret nook on the mountain. This rationalizing interpretation continues even to the end of Jesus' life and issues in a superficial explanation, which is no explanation at all, because it does not enable one to understand the founding of the Christian community. The grave of Jesus is empty-all sorts of rumors regarding a theft of the body by friends or enemies are being whispered about the city. "But the women who loved him believed they saw in wakeful dreams the risen Jesus in bodily form." That is the final sentence of the book. The statement proves to be a denial of critical findings in the study of tradition; it proves also to be a denial of the his- torical situation. The rise of the Easter faith, which changed men, and not merely dreaming women, from fugitives into apostles, is a historical problem never visualized by Ludwig. Instead of this we are shown the areas of idyllic sentimentality and gentle enthusiasm. It is the world of Renan and not of the New Testament. But any supposition regarding the end of Jesus' life which aims to be taken seriously as a critical hypothe- sis must enable the reader to understand, or at least to surmise, how from the disgraceful and shameful outcome on Calvary there could arise this new movement, this faith, and this book of faith. IV I have designated Wernle's book as typical of future inter- pretation of Jesus. That this type belongs to the future is shown by the book of Rudolf Bultmann which appeared under the title. Jesus in 1926. The book is marked by two things: it renounces both the attempt to reproduce the life of Jesus and the effort to fathom psychologically his personality. The for- mer restraint is not, so Bultmann confesses, necessarily forced on him by the fragmentary nature of the sources; it appears to</page><page sequence="21">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 199 him to have been necessitated much more by the second re- straint. He who wishes to understand Jesus today must not reconstruct his mind but must fix attention on his work-not on the work actually achieved in the Christian church but on the work that Jesus "really" had willed; and this can be repro- duced only as "an accumulation of sentences, of ideas, in the form of teaching." Bultmann has consciously ruled out all that has been written for nearly a century and a half about the life of Jesus, about his personality, and about his inner develop- ment. This constitutes a criticism of the traditional interpre- tation of the life of Jesus, and the reader of this article knows that I share this doubt. Yet I would raise an objection to Bult- mann's complete elimination of the narrative materials. Bultmann is of the opinion that Jesus did not believe himself to be the Messiah. Bultmann knows how very diverse the views on this subject are, and he concludes that "if we are ut- terly in the dark on this matter we know practically nothing about his [Jesus'] personality." On reading this statement, one questions whether Bultmann has not simply made a virtue of necessity in refraining from the use of data for a life of Jesus. For apparently it is not a result of his methodology, but his skeptical criticism of the sources, that compels this restraint. Bultmann aims to set forth what Jesus had "actually" desired to effect. And in order to make expressions like the "Kingdom of God" (Gottesherrschaft) intelligible, he very properly de- scribes the environing world, giving a picture of Judaism with its hopes and the messianic movements arising therefrom. John the Baptist, whose later influence Bultmann believes to be rec- ognizable in the Mandean sect, is associated with these move- ments; and Jesus also has the same associations. Then it is im- possible to avoid the question of how Jesus related himself personally to the hope of his people. One who sees, not a later creation of the community, but a reproduction of historical conversations in such tradition as the confession of Peter, the question addressed to Jesus by the Baptist, or the request of</page><page sequence="22">200 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the sons of Zebedee, is forced to regard these matters as an essential part of the preaching of Jesus. And if the conduct of Jesus displayed in connection with his teaching issues in his final conflict with the Jewish authorities, and if Jesus was ex- ecuted as a messianic pretender according to the import of the inscription on the cross, then this final outcome of his teaching must be included in one's interpretation of his preaching. But if all of these items are unhistorical, it is still necessary never- theless to account for the catastrophe. In this respect it seems to me out of place to make a radical renunciation of the events of Jesus' life, at least of such events as are thoroughly in accord with what Jesus had "actually" proposed. Yet in the main I indorse Bultmann's method and approve of his critical attitude toward all psychologizing interpretations. Thus an exposition of Jesus' message forms the essential con- tent of Bultmann's book. Yet this message is not presented as a system of thought. One is not concerned with statements "which have validity apart from the concrete situation in which the speaker stands." Jesus' preaching does not consist in objectively accurate ideas whose truth, utility, depth, and beauty are capable of universal proof, but in appeals to men in their particular situation in life. With great consistency all of this message is derived from the eschatological aspect of Jesus' preaching. Jesus desires to effect decisions, not to cultivate in- ward religious attitudes. Thus he does not aim to cultivate all the capacities of men, or to do good for its own sake, or to pro- vide the individual soul with any sort of training at all. But Jesus confronts men with the necessity of decision when he an- nounces the will of God and demands outright obedience. In this situation neutrality is gone, and also any mere obedience to the words of Jesus as though they constituted a law. For the crisis forces from the obedient man a completely new act no- where prescribed, neither in an ethical system nor in the Ser- mon on the Mount. All the words of Jesus that have the ap- pearance of statutes are radical imperatives designed to make</page><page sequence="23">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 201 clear the perfect obedience which everyone has always to real- ize in the immediate and in every new concrete situation. Jesus, accordingly, taught no ethics, for he had no theory about man with his possibilities and ideal purposes. Jesus does not have the conception "ethics." He prescribes no standard of conduct for man-even paints no ideal picture of man!-and regards him as too insecure in his existence to be able to decide about possibilities of conduct. The crisis is upon man; it is as if he stood in empty space before God. Therefore Jesus needs no theory about sin, since sin is an essential characteristic of man in the presence of God. "Jesus does not speak about men, saying that they are sinners, but he speaks to men who are sinners." In this exposition of Bultmann's one will immediately per- ceive that it accords with the specific conception of man and God set forth in the theology of Karl Barth. And, in fact, the picture of Jesus sketched by Bultmann is frequently criticized on the ground that it reflects too much the ideas of the present and therefore is-in spite of all protest against psychological modernizing-itself just one more modernization only effected in another way. Bultmann himself knows that a historical in- terpretation, if it is to be profitable, always depends upon the interpreter's moving from his own situation into that of the person whom he interprets. But that criticism which sees in Bultmann's Jesus simply the views of the Barthian theology ought still to ask whether Bultmann has not discovered and expressed essential facts not present in the Barthian theology and not dependent upon it for their validity. Perhaps in this connection I may refer to the fact that I myself expressed the same ideas in my book Evangelium und Welt, the first edition of which appeared in 1925 under the title Geschichtliche und iibergeschichtliche Religion. I expressed the opinion that the gospel contained no ethic; and that the commands of Jesus de- pict by way of example on exceptional occasions how one has to act, but do not prescribe what everyone has to do in his spe-</page><page sequence="24">202 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION cifically conditioned situation. Only I-in opposition to Bult- mann-thought it possible to exhibit a common basis for all the sayings of Jesus and to designate him as "the new being" before God, since the eschatological message places man in a new situation before God-"in the crisis," says Bultmann. But he and I, even though frequently we have used quite dif- ferent conceptions, have for the most part been in essential agreement as to what significance this situation should have for men. According to my description of the attitude of Jesus' hearer, what impresses him is "not a new world-view, a new statement of principle, a newly manifested wisdom, but the awakened feeling of the overpowering nearness of God-that is, the nearness of the Kingdom of God in the eschatological sense-a feeling that also reshaped, ennobled and expanded other emotions." That which Jesus sets up in opposition to the thoroughly approved Jewish feeling of hate toward the ene- mies of God and of his people is not "the special exercise of love for enemies, but the greatness of the feeling of love which has been kindled by the nearness of God and has now become truly absolute, transcending human doubts and calculations. Also enmity among men cannot restrict a love that wells up from a new vital motive. No human limitations at all can be fixed for one seized by this feeling, for this love which emanates from the love of God itself is measured only by its own standards." Similarly, Bultmann says regarding the command to love, "for Jesus' love is thought of neither as a virtue which pertains to man's perfection nor as an aid to the well-being of society, but as the self-conquest of the will in the concrete situation of life where a man is confronted by other men." "Love for neighbor and enemy does not rest upon an agitated and sentimental feel- ing of sympathy or admiration which still perceives in the most depraved individual the vestiges of divine, noble, and imperish- able humanity, but it rests upon the command of God. Thus love is not some especially strong emotion." When I retain the word emotion (A fekt), it is chiefly because the fundamental</page><page sequence="25">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 203 attitude leading to the Christian decision seems to me to be re- leased through an emotion. For the news of the nearness of God's kingdom does not immediately force men into the atti- tude of obedience, but first into the attitude of self-humiliation, in which one recognizes with horror the distance between God and man. The agreement between Bultmann's exposition and my own is evident, above all else, in our common effort to guard against a misapprehension. We both oppose the notion that the Ser- mon on the Mount was meant to be statutory in character and that the Christian life was to be realized by keeping this law. The Sermon on the Mount does not aim to improve this world, or to furnish a program for the world to come; but its impera- tives are designed to grip and transform men, and thus to pre- pare them for the Kingdom of God. That interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount which makes it a law capable of being kept seems to us to be a legalistic perversion of the gospel; and on the other hand, our interpretation is connected by its oppo- nents with certain representatives of modern thinking-with Kierkegaard in the case of Bultmann and with Johannes Mtil- ler in my own case. The discussion has been pursued along such lines by Hans Windisch, for example, in his book Der Sinn der Bergpredigt. The result has, in my opinion, been a very profit- able discussion which does not, however, belong within the range of problems under consideration here. As to specific questions about the life of Jesus, I believe I can give somewhat more definite answers than Bultmann does. That this is quite possible, even from the point of view here represented, is demonstrated by the interpretation of Jesus' career which appeared last year as the article "Jesus Christ" in the new edition of the large encyclopedia, Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart. The author of the article is Karl Lud- wig Schmidt, professor at Bonn, but formerly at Giessen and at Jena. Schmidt, like Bultmann and myself, is an adherent of the so-called formgeschichtliche method described at the begin-</page><page sequence="26">204 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ning of this article. Accordingly, he refrains from writing a biography of Jesus, because one is unable to discern and de- scribe the course of Jesus' life. But he does not renounce inter- pretation of Jesus' conduct, as it is made known above all in his acts of healing and in the cleansing of the temple, an act which Schmidt quite properly stresses as typical and decisive. This deed belongs to the work of Jesus, it expresses his summons to repentance, and it demands obedience toward God. Schmidt presents the teaching of Jesus from a point of view similar to that which was determinative for Bultmann. The in- fluence of the dialectic theology of Karl Barth is recognizable also in Schmidt's work. But his purpose includes more than a mere historical exposition. He also undertakes in his picture of Jesus to provide the basis for assertion of belief about Jesus. The hero-worship into which the liberal type of life of Jesus evaporates seems to Schmidt to be an impoverishment of Christology. But he rejects the analysis of the problem as indicated at the beginning of this article and set forth in my book Evangelium und Welt, where I distinguish between his- torical affirmation, which is never sufficient for faith, and the superhistorical affirmation made by faith but never capable of scientific demonstration. He rejects this distinction because "with such a synthesis, attractive in itself, the facts of the primitive Christian confession presented in the gospels" are not, or are not sufficiently, in accord. I would reply that it is not at all a matter of recovering the primitive Christian con- fession; but what concerns us is the fact that we, as men who hold scientific views and Christian beliefs, truly affirm both our scientific findings and our beliefs. I would allude in particular to one other matter. Schmidt himself closes his sketch on Chris- tology with the conclusion that he is concerned with "the com- mission and vocation of Jesus Christ in word and deed derived from the biblical setting and not capable of being classified in universal history." This recognition of the impossibility of classifying the content of an actual Christian Christology in</page><page sequence="27">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 205 the category of universal history again appears to me to lead to the distinction which I advocated between historical and superhistorical. If one is unwilling to misuse faith by employ- ing it as a makeshift for historical knowledge, then only one con- clusion can be drawn. Jesus, as historically known and classified in connection with historical happenings, does not save; and the saving quality of the Christ known to faith cannot be exhibited by means of historical research because it is superhistorical in character, because it permits of no comparison, and belongs to no human category. V Thus the present theological controversy about Jesus leads immediately to the problem of Christology. Therefore, in con- clusion I shall consider two recent theological publications in German that have treated the Christological problem in per- petual conflict with the representatives of historical research. The first of these books, like the works of Bultmann and Schmidt, is a product of the dialectical theology of Barth. This is Der Mittler ("The Mediator") by Emil Brunner, professor in Zurich. I can here neither describe nor criticize the total content of the book, its exposition of revelation, of the divine person of the Messiah, and of reconciliation. What concerns us in this connection is Brunner's discussion of historical ques- tions. Exactly along the lines that I have already sketched he criticizes the older conception of a life of Jesus, ultimately traceable to the Enlightenment, in which it is believed possible to find in the gospel the consummation of an ethical ideal for humanity; and he shows that this conception is refuted by recognizing the eschatological character of Jesus' preaching. From this position, at which research has now arrived, he di- rects his criticism against the view that there is an antithesis between the historical Jesus and the faith of the community. "Assuming it to be true that Jesus did 'only' and said 'only' what the radical historical critics accept as actually historical,</page><page sequence="28">20o6 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION who has the courage to say that this cannot be the Christ in whom the church and in whom Paul and John believe?" Proceeding from this position, Brunner presents a positive justification of the Christology of the ancient church. The thesis of Ritschl and Harnack, to the effect that developing dogma rep- resents a hellenization of, and therefore a partial deviation from, the gospel, is dismissed by Brunner with the very questionable affirmation: "The modern rationalism of a Ritschl or a Harnack is much more Greek than the teaching of Irenaeus, Athanasius, and Cyril." On the contrary, it is said that trinitarian teach- ing-the identity of the one who reveals and is revealed-the dogma of the two natures with all its consequence, conforms to the gospel picture. Above all, there is agreement in the view that Christ indeed took on human nature but was not a human person. For, says Brunner, the place where sin has its seat is in the mystery of personality, at the innermost point of our actual existence and of the conscious self. At this point Christ possesses not a sinful human person but a divine Logos person, or rather, he is himself this divine person. Although these con- siderations are fundamental and actually touch the point at which faith in Christ is distinguished from all man-worship, this reproduction of the teaching of the ancient church also appears to me not to escape the error of most such restatements of ideas. Clearly Brunner is not aware of the fact that he also modernizes. This teaching about the mystery of personality signifies more than a reproduction of ancient teaching. Its connection with the dialectic theology is apparent; and this becomes especially clear in his conception of revelation: "Reve- lation consists in the fact that God speaks and man is silent. Everything depends on this utterance of God alone. We are unable to respond. Where should we find ground for an affirma- tive reply? The fact that God answers where we should-that is revelation, that is faith." "Faith-the possibility of belief and not merely the content of belief-is the gift of God, as the bible testifies."</page><page sequence="29">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 207 This Christology is now related to the historical life of Jesus in a way that shows acquaintance with all modern criticism. This is the most significant thing for us in the present connec- tion. In his picture of the historical Jesus, Brunner sets in the foreground a threefold "coincidence of opposites": (i) the union of a zeal for judgment with unconditional forgiving love; (2) an interest in immediate human concerns, such as an under- standing of children and nature, side by side with indifference toward such human concerns as religious, national, and cultural obligations; and finally (3) the affirmation of religious tradition combined with a threatening attitude toward the whole estab- lished order. In these statements truly decisive features in the portrait of Jesus are stressed, and they are accentuated by the fact that Brunner seeks to prove the historicity of Jesus' messianic claims by the use of practically the same texts as are employed by Schmidt and myself. But the manner in which he seeks to deduce from these coincidences his particular Chris- tology seems to me doubtful. He thinks that every unbiased reader of the gospel narratives must recognize incomprehensible features in the portrait of Jesus, and on the strength of the first- noted coincidence even the intelligent secular historian will say that it represents something "unique." In the sense in which Brunner here wishes "unique" to be taken, the historian ought not to use the word at all. At most he can say of a phenomenon that he has not met its like before-that may be due to his own limitations or to the defectiveness of his sources-but he cannot affirm that such a thing has never happened before or that it may never happen again. That conviction is not a matter of historical knowledge. It is just here that one is able to intro- duce another point of view which is fundamentally different from that of the historian. In dealing with the question of Jesus' messianic claim, Brun- ner has indeed stressed the distinction between these two points of view. It appears to him historically credible that Jesus held himself to be the Messiah. In complete agreement with the</page><page sequence="30">208 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION religio-historical way of thinking, Brunner desires that Jesus' claim shall be understood, not in a transformed sense, but in its complete fantastic form. Hence Jesus means just what he says in the statement, "Blessed is he who is not offended in me." For one who knows by faith that Jesus is the Christ, this his- torical testimony supports and confirms the belief that he actually is such. If it does no less, it certainly does no more! Therefore it is entirely proper that the question as to whether Jesus thought himself the Messiah should be debatable; "for it is characteristic of the true Messiah that subsequent genera- tions may dispute about him. Similarly, the controversy about the sense in which he held himself to be the Messiah is also not out of place, for how could a unique phenomenon be otherwise expressed than in some ordinary imagery, that is in some sort of historically presentable form?" The controversy over the meaning of the messianic title "goes with the lowly form of the Son of God, the incarnate Word, the Jesus Christ"; hence even the historian is not excluded when it is said "blessed is he who is not offended in me." Karl Bornhausen, professor at Breslau, and formerly at Mar- burg, makes it his aim "to interpret the historical content of the Christian faith in accordance with the needs of the educated man in modern European civilization." The first of his books written in pursuit of this purpose is called Der Erl-ser ("The Savior"). If I understand him correctly, it is from the point of view of Wilhelm Hermann that Bornhausen proposes to appre- hend and interpret that historical life which stands at the begin- ning of our religion. "The form of the historical occurrence, being long past, is unessential; significance lies only in the vital meaning which it comes to have for us." But the wealth of his- torical allusions and generalizations in Bornhausen's book makes it far from easy for the reader to perceive just what the author has chiefly in mind. In connection with a religio-his- torical exposition of the ancient idea of salvation, Bornhausen briefly designates the historical Savior Jesus as savior of body</page><page sequence="31">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 209 and soul, the social redeemer, the herald of pure faith. The ob- jection which I must offer to this way of thinking arises from the question of whether here one does not pass all too easily from the past to the present, from the historical Jesus to the evaluation of his message for all time. Bornhausen has not taken into account the fact that Jesus utters his words with the imminent kingdom of God in view, and therefore desires to pro- vide neither healing nor a social ethic for this world. It seems to me to be a modernizing emphasis when, for example, Born- hausen affirms that Jesus stands forth in the tradition of the first century "as the one who is perfectly sound and who just because of that fact heals the infirmities. of body and soul." Nothing of this is known in the only tradition that could be authoritative on the subject, namely, the tradition of the New Testament, which is still uninfluenced by ideas derived from the world of culture and the educated classes. And the healings of Jesus are nowhere esteemed as the effects of the health of the healer, but always as the act of God. On the other hand, it is a striking fact-and is entirely as it should be from the point of view of Brunner's book-that we know as little about the health of Jesus as we do about his appearance. And when Bornhausen notes that Christendom attributed to its savior the bodily beauty of the ancient gods' statues, it is possible to assert that this feature in the history of Christian art was inspired much less by an exact knowledge of Jesus than by the ancient humani- tarian thought of God as the perfect man. Or, indeed, this result may have been due to the necessity of the artist, who had no other models than the beautiful anthropomorphic gods of tradition known to him. While the figure of Jesus, as Born- hausen properly emphasizes, towers above the limitations of his time and his country, yet this transcendence over time and nationality is due to the eschatological orientation of his mes- sage rather than to the totality of the humanity comprehended in him. It is true that the testimony of the ancient church can be cited in support of this pronounced humanistic notion; but,</page><page sequence="32">210 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION even so, its exponents are often more influenced by ancient tra- dition than by the message of the gospel. Again it seems to me to be a similar humanistic reinterpreta- tion of the early Christian testimony when Bornhausen extols "friendship and love manifest in an entirely free and vital form" as a social accomplishment of the historical man Jesus. The social imperative of the gospel does not depend upon ideals which Jesus had prescribed for life in human communities or had exemplified in living with his disciples, but upon the knowl- edge which overtakes all men in the presence of the kingdom of God. This is a recognition of the fact that all men, rich as well as poor, righteous as well as unrighteous, stand under the same judgment before God and are in need of the same mercy, and that it bodes ill for man to permit distinctions to prevail when God himself invites people from "the by-ways and hedges" to his banquet. The Christology that seeks to obtain a statement about the Christ of faith from the picture of the historical Jesus cannot be substantiated by a humanistic reinterpretation of Jesus, not even though it can cite men of ancient Christendom as witnesses for this interpretation. I have included these books about Christology along with the works previously considered, because I regard them as typical witnesses to the cultural and theological status in present-day Germany. Yet these citations fall far short of exhausting the literature on Jesus. I have not indicated lines of development emanating from a type of christological thinking already cur- rent at the beginning of the century and still to be encountered in modern writings. The great influence exerted by Adolf Schlatter of Tiibingen upon generations of theologians emanates also from his book Die Geschichte des Christus. Within the younger generation this influence is most clearly traceable in the little book Jesus Christ by Emil Hirsch of Gottingen. It attempts to proceed from "given information" in the teaching and story of Jesus Christ to "acquired knowledge" of a Christological sort.</page><page sequence="33">JESUS IN CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THEOLOGY 211 Also, no mention is made here of consciously biased works, like the original but often erroneous interpretation of the gospel which Karl Bornhdiuser of Marburg deduces from Jewish ma- terials in his book Das Wirken des Christus durch Taten und Worte. Neither have I mentioned the dilettante attempt to squeeze Jesus into some sort of modern mold, as an example of which I mention the book of Hans Bliuher, Die Aristie des Jesus von Nazareth; nor have I included the interpretations that en- deavor immediately to transform Jesus into a modem man, as has been done by Walter Classen and Josef Wittig. Finally, this survey neglects to notice consciously Catholic interpretations, like the Jesus Christ of August Reatz. These works are omitted because my task was to exhibit the difficulties of a problem which is solved for a Catholic by the teaching of his church. It knows no problem of a contrast between historical knowledge and the claims of faith. If the recent German works that I have described show slight agreement in the effort toward a uniform solution of this prob- lem, they certainly attest that the problem is recognized and newly defined, and perhaps defined more sharply than was pos- sible for the past generation. Also it is characteristic of the new situation that the demand for historical knowledge based on a strictly methodical study of the sources and the demand for carefully formulated statements about the significance of Jesus Christ for believing Christians are no longer felt to be mutually hostile interests. Also, one is now required to abandon the at- tempt to unite these two problems by the use of pious expres- sions. To state with clearness and sincerity both the demands of history and the claims of faith, in order to do justice to them, at least in a personal if not in a scientific synthesis-that may be designated as the task continually imposed upon us by the problem of historical study in connection with faith in Christ.</page></plain_text>
