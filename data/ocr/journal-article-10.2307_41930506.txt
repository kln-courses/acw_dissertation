<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESTHER JACOBSON (University of Oregon) SIBERIAN ROOTS OF THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE Images of the great cervidae-red deer, reindeer and elk -have an ancient history in Eurasia. Rock representations and bone carvings from Karelia and the Ural region indicate that in the third-second millennium B. C. there existed a cult of the female elk, in which sacrifices and image-making may have related to communal fertility rites. The con- tinuity of this tradition eastward across Siberia and down into the Bronze Age (late second millennium B. C.) is attested to by numerous rock representations from the Tom, Angara and Lena rivers. By the early first millennium B. C., the South Siberian elk image had been replaced by representations of great antlered reindeer and red stags (Cervus elaphus), frequently joined by horned anthropomorphic figures. During the first half of the first millennium B. C., these were in turn replaced by coherent hunting scenes in which archers on foot confront reindeer and red deer: stags, doe and young. Probably dating to the late Siberian Bronze and early Iron Ages (VIII-VII c. B.C.) are the early "stag stones" from Transbaikal, Mongolia and Tuva, on which first elk and reindeer and then (VI- V c. B.C.) red stags with elaborated antlers were richly carved like totemic ornaments on stelae of vaguely an- thropomorphic reference. These stag stones document the final transi- tion from the ancient Siberian tradition of cervid representation, rooted in fertility cults focussed on the female elk, to the appearance of the Scythian stag with elaborated antlers. This final artistic transformation coincides with, and offers documentation for, the social and cultural transformation of the proto-Scythians from the Bronze Age into the Iron Age, and into history. * * *</page><page sequence="2">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 69 The stag with elaborated antlers is the most familiar and culturally identifying motif in Scytho-Siberian art.1 Usually represented in bronze or gold, standing or in an equivocal position with legs folded under, Scytho-Siberian stag images shared a number of traits in common before influences from Greece transformed the very meaning and form of the animal: they were almost always shown in full profile, heads raised as if on the alert; their elaborated antlers suggested a particular significance attached to that part of the animal; and in their formal arrangement they were isolated from any other reference to the phenomenal world. In- tended to emblazon shields, quiver cases, pole-tops and clothing, they appear to modern eyes more significant as a religious or tribal symbol2 than as indicator of a larger natural context. While the stag is the most commonly repeated zoomorphic motif in Scytho-Siberian art, it is not the only one. Felines, horses, beak-heads and eagle griffons came to be characterizing elements of that artistic tradition. An exception is found among those objects associated with the Scytho-Siberians of northern Kazakhstan through the so-called Treasure of Peter the Great, in which the stag image is virtually absent.3 Nonetheless, the simultaneous appearance of the Scytho-Siberians and the stag image, and the subsequent disappearance of the stag image in the III c. B.C. as Scythian culture became submerged in that of Greece 1 Throughout this paper, the term "Scytho-Siberian" will be used to refer to both the Iranian-speaking people in the Pontic region, whom the Greeks called "Scythians," and the culturally related nomadic peoples who dominated the Eurasian steppes, from the shores of the Danube through South Russia and Central Asia into Mongolia, between VII and III c. B.C. Scytho-Siberians of specific regions will be referred to by individualizing terms, e. g., Scythians, Sakas, etc. Several Soviet scholars have suggested that the stag was the Scythian tribal totem.

None of the objects was scientifically excavated and there is no certainty as to which nomadic people they belonged. In general, however, the objects do form a cohe- rent group with regard to motifs, style, material and technique, and they were definitely done by some Scytho-Siberian group in the late Scythian period.

Like its Scythian cultural context, its source in space, if not in time, remains an enigma. A number of scholars have examined the stag motif in Scytho-Siberian art, seeing in its identity and origins significant clues to the origins of the whole artistic tradition. Minns argued for an origin in Siberia, the south- ernmost region of reindeer herding,4 a position concurred in by Borov- ka.5 Implicitly if not explicitly, Max Loehr has offered support for the position taken by Minns and Borovka, arguing that the South Siberian Tagar stag image predates that of the Transcaucasian and Pontic reg- ions, going back to the IX c. B.C. and flourishing in the VIII and VII centuries; and that the Transcaucasian version can be traced back to the Tagar and Maiemir formulations.6 M. I. Artamonov, on the other hand, found the ultimate origin of Scytho-Siberian art and of specific motifs - the stag, the panther and the bird-of-prey - rooted in the artistic tradi- tions of the Medes and, before that, in the older art traditions of Iran and 4 Ellis Howell Minns, The Art of the Northern Nomads , Proceedings of the British Academy, XXVIII, (London, 1942), pp. 57-58.

According to Artamonov, the Scythians derived their representational forms from the Medes during their sojourn in northern Iran. After migrating back to the Pontic region, they continued to develop specific characteristics of this derived tradition: a preference for working in gold and the use of isolated zoomorphic images presented with a stylized formality and in a constricted posture. The Medes, on the other hand, transmitted their own tradi- tion to the Iranian speaking nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples of Central Asia and South Siberia. From this initial bifurcation of an Ancient Near Eastern tradition developed the diversity and unity of Scythian art and, specifically, of the stag image. Among Soviet scholars arguing for an Ancient Near Eastern derivation of the Scytho-Siberian animal style, B. B. Piotrovskij has had particularly great influ- ence. See his studies of Urartian art and culture: Karmir-blur , /, (Erevan, 1950) and Karmir-blur , II , (Erevan, 1952).

B.C. treasure of Sakkiz ("Ziwiye treasure") included the oldest examples of Scythian art, including the earliest example of the Scythian stag, while the great Kostromskaja stag [Fig. 1] expresses an early but mature phase of Scythian art.

The most extensive and significant consideration of the Scytho-Sibe- rian stag is that of N. L. Členova, published first in Russian and subse- quently translated into French.8 Členova's point of departure is rep- resented by 111 stag representations from the Minusinsk region, thirty- two of which come from dated complexes. Analyzing them into ten groups on the basis of stylistic features (e. g., treatment of antlers, legs, muzzle shape, eyes, tail), she proposed a chronological development in the Minusinsk image beginning no earlier than the V c. B.C. and disap- pearing by the end of the III or early II c. B.C. Comparing the Minusinsk images with the well-known gold plaques from kurgan #5 at Čiliktin, Eastern Kazakhstan (Fig. 2), dated to the VI c. B.C., with those from Sakkiz and Kostromskaja (Map 1), Členova concluded that the Scythian stag image must have first emerged somewhere in the region between northern Iran and Lake Zaysan (Eastern Kazakhstan), 8 Členova, op. cit., translated as "Le Cerf Scythe," Artibus Asine , 26 (1963), 27-70.</page><page sequence="5">72 ESTHER JACOBSON Fig. 2: Chased gold plaque in the form of a stag from the Gold Kurgan, Čiliktin valley, Eastern Kazakhstan.

From there it flowed east and west, appearing first in the region of Sakkiz and only subsequently in the Minusinsk valley.9 While admitting that the Scythian stag image is occasionally more reminiscent of elk, Členova insists that its actual identity is noble or red deer.10 Despite Členova's extensive analysis, examination of material remains from Central Asia and Kazakhstan lends little support to the hypothesis that the source of the stag image was somewhere in the region between northeastern Iran and Lake Zaysan. Ibex, saiga and horses are far more characteristic of the non-predator animal motifs in Saka art than is the stag.11 A bronze standing stag from Ujgarak, on the lower Syr-Darya is, 9 Členova, 1972, p. 195. Problems in interpretation arise from Členova's high- ly detailed analysis of the Minusinsk images. Many of these pieces, both those from known sites and those only associated with Minusinsk, are simple, even crude, representations, in which stylistic variation may be as indicative of a primitive workmanship as it is of deliberate typological variation. This is particu- larly relevant with regard to the antlers, which by their very nature lend them- selves to stylization. Similarly, if the stag were indeed conceived as totemic and debased into a quasi-decorative, quasi-amuletic image, it might be argued that the precise manner in which the legs or antlers are treated is of relatively little assistance in assigning date and meaning to stylistic variation. Since precision in the dating of early Iron Age Minusinsk kurgāns is highly dependent upon ques- tions of relative style, arguments regarding chronology of such kurgāns and of their contents risk becoming circular. 10 Ibid, y p. 191.

Andronovo manifestations to the west, south and northwest of Lake Zaysan as well as in its Aral Sea variation (Tazabagjab culture) and in its extensions to the north-east of the Cas- pian and Aral Seas [Map 1] indicate an absolute interest in geometric decor of a non-representational kind.14 While it is possible that zoomor- phic representations may have occurred in perishable materials such as wood or felt, there is nothing in the ceramic decor to indicate or negate such a possibility. Eastern extensions of the Andronovo culture, called variously Timber-grave or Shrubnaja, and dated by Gimbutas ca. 2000-800 B.C.,15 are equally lacking in zoomorphic representations, the ceramic vessels and bronze weapons indicating a geometric decorative tradition. Exceptions are the geometricized elements on some Shrubnaja vessels which suggest "crosses, horses, snakes, and other 'inscriptions'" to Gimbutas.16 Both Gimbutas and Sulimirski consider the Timber- S.

Since writing this text, I gained access to recently published material which makes available a number of archaeological finds in Central Asia. Stone carvings of stylized stags with arched withers and full antlers at Syrat-taš, in the Ferghana valley, and an Aržan-Maimir type maral (?) from the Talas valley site of Ur- Maral suggest a more frequent representation of cervids in the mountainous regions of Central Asia during the Scythian period. See Ja. A. Šer, Petroglifi Srednoj i CentraVnoj Azii , (Moscow, 1980), pp. 79-120, figs. 27 and 31. The obvious stylistic connection between these cervids and those from South Sibe- rian stag stones (discussed later in this paper) should be carefully noted. It serves to support the hypothesis advanced in this paper that the stag image came out of South Siberia in the pre-Scythian and early Scythian periods. 12 O. A.

B.C.17 In contrast to the Shrubnaja, but reflecting a mixture of Shrubnaja and local cultures, the Koban and related Caucasian cultures of the early first millennium B.C. had ornamented bronze weapons and decorative objects with representations of animals, including stags. On two bronze belt buckles from the Koban culture,18 stags stand one over the other with taut long legs and with antlers shown in a three-quarter view, the whole animal conveying an air of alertness and vitality. An iron-inlaid bronze belt buckle in the Hermitage Museum, Leningrad, combines pert stags with elaborately geometricized decorative panels. Also in the Her- mitage are two Koban ceremonial axes with similarly standing stags, one of which has the curious addition of a long tail; and a pin, the head of which is decorated with the sculptured figure of a stag attacked by two wolves (?).19 Related to these images in style and suggestion of vitality is that of a horned or antlered animal on a lugged adze from Kerch, Crimea, dated to the early first millennium B.C.20 These early instances of stag representation, predating the Scythian period but occurring in a region through which the proto-Scythians are believed to have moved on their way into northern Iran, deserve serious consideration. Like the later Scythian stag image, they all represent the animal isolated from a described natural context. But in significant contrast to the early Scyth- ian stags, some of the Koban images occur accompanied by a wolf-like predator, or attacked by such, creating the implication of narrative con- text. It is this implied context, as well as the alert appearance of the animals, which sharply distinguishes the Koban stag from, e. g., the Kostromskaja ètag. Finally, the Koban stags are light in body compared with those from early Scythian kurgāns and their antlers are elaborated vertically as if in reference to the Caucasian roe deer ( Cervus capreolus) or Mesopotamian fallow deer ( Cervus mesopotamicus Brooke). While the Koban stag image suggests the possibility of a connection between Koban art and Scythian art, the nature of that connection remains un- clear. We may only conclude that stag images are characteristic of both artistic traditions, and that sometimes the Koban stag is represented in 17 Ibid. y pp. 576-77; and Sulimirsky, p. 399. 18 Bunker, pl. 26a, b. iy A similar pin, from the Musée des Antiquités Nationales au Chateau de St. Germain-en-Laye, is reproduced in Bunker, pl. 28b. 20 Gimbutas, fig. 348.</page><page sequence="9">76 ESTHER JACOBSON an isolation recalling that of the early Scythian stag. But these conclu- sions are not persuasive of deeper ties between the stag images and "animal" styles of the Koban and Pontic Scythian cultures. Despite Artamonov's hypothesis, the case for an Ancient Near East- ern provenance for the stag image is no more promising. From the Early Dynastic period (ca. 3000-2340) are known several representations of the stag together with the lion-headed eagle, Imdugud: in these cases, the stags appear to be an aspect of the god of fertility.21 More frequently, stags are represented on cylinder seals within a natural setting, some- times - dappled and antlered like a fallow deer - gamboling among wooded mountains, suggesting thereby the fecundity of nature.22 This very insistence on a natural setting marked by trees and mountains and the objectively depicted vitality of the animal sharply and decisively differentiates the Mesopotamian and Assyrian stags from those of the early Scythians. It is not enough that there be identity of motif to sup- port the theory that one version, the Scythian, comes out of the other: there must also be something shared beyond that identity, both with regard to the formulation of the motif and with regard to its larger cultural context. There is nothing to have us believe that the Scythians shared any cultural traditions with those of the Assyrians except, perhaps, a love of warfare and a fierce ambition for supremacy. To insist that identity of motif must imply direct lineage is to discount the signifi- cance of both visual and cultural context (indicated through the pictorial and iconographie setting), as well as to imply that the art of a more "primitive" people had to have come into being under the influence of a "higher" culture. The evidence would seem to indicate something quite different: that the Scythian stag image came out of a northern tradition rooted in neolithic cults of the elk and in Bronze Age shamanic cultures. Examination of the extensive rock paintings and carvings of northern Europe and, in particular, of Siberia indicates a northern source for the Scythian stag image, a source rooted in ancient religious veneration of the cervid. It is this material from Scandinavia, Northern Russia, and 21 Henri Frankfort, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient , The Pelican History of Art (London, 1970), pp. 60-61. A well-known example of this combination of Imdugud and stags, referred to by Frankfort (Fig. 63), is the copper relief from Al 'Ubaid, presently in the British Museum. 22 E. g., seal with standing stags and goats in front of trees, from the Third Early Dynastic period and two Middle Assyrian seals, one of a true fallow deer.

At Lake Onega can be found ships with animal-headed (elk or reindeer) prows; strange tailed and animal-headed anthropomorphic figures, frequently referred to as shamans; waterbirds and female elk [Figs. 7, 8, 10]. At Zalavruga, masked ithyphallic figures and animal-headed prows also associate these petroglyphs with Bronze Age representations from Sweden such as the horned figure from Jär- restad [Fig. 6] and the bird-headed figures from Bohuslän [Fig. 5]. One well-known composition from Zalavruga includes a long procession of reindeer, the largest ones of which are superimposed over several long boats [Fig. 10]. All the animals are shown moving in a line, in strict profile (i. e., two legs shown instead of four). Behind one of the antlered reindeer appears a small figure of a man on snowshoes, tailed and pos- sibly carrying a bow and arrow. Whether or not this figure was done at the same time, and in intended relationship to the reindeer, is impossible to determine. His presence, like that of the masked figures and boats suggests a chronological horizon similar to that of the Swedish petro- glyphs with warriors, spirals and boats, that is, no later than the latter half of the second millennium B.C.23 To the same period if not somewhat later would be assigned the reindeer, since the largest ones are superim- posed over the boats.24 A copper dagger from Sejma, terminating in an elk's head [Fig. 12a] and wooden carvings of elk from the Uralian peat bogs of Shigir and Gorbunovo [Fig. 12, b, c] confirm a dating for the Karelian petroglyphs in the latter second millennium B.C. These objects, together with ceramic pieces stamped with elk and water-bird figures,25 are assigned to the Early Classical or Sejma phase of the North Russian Turbino culture, dated by major sites to the period ca. 1500-1300/1250 B.C. This preceeded that period, called Late Turbino, characterized by a transition to a predominantly stockbreeding culture dependent on horses, cattle, 23 See Peter Gelling and Hilda Ellis Davidson, The Chariot of the Sun , (Lon- don, 1969). 24 Formozov suggests, however, the possibility of an earlier date in the sec- ond millennium, possibly even as early as the third millennium B.C.

Near the main group appears a nest of circles, the outer one ornamented with rays as if to convey a solar signification. Above the whole group can be seen a large convex arc with projecting dentations on the upper side. Similar disks and arcs appear on a number of the other rock paintings in that region, together with characteristic zigzags and profiles of water fowl.29 Representations of anthropomorphic figures are lacking. Whether or not Cernecov's early dating for this complex of cliff paintings is accurate, it cannot be denied that the repeated motifs suggest a cluster of religiously significant elements: elk, solar disks, and water-fowl - all paralleling motifs found at Karelian and Scandinavian sites. These Uralian rep- resentations differ from the others, however, not only in technique of presentation and in style, but also by the fact that the elk represented here are antlerless and thus presumably female.

Open mouth, softly humped nose and humped withers capture the specificity of this cervid. Bone carvings of anthropomorphic figures and bearlike figures in stone31 from the same Yenisey site confirm the possibility of cultural connection between this region and sites in Karelia. It is, however, the rock rep- resentations on the cliffs above the great Siberian rivers - the Tom, Angara and Lena - which offer the most startling and powerful tes- timony for a neolithic cult of the female elk.32 These images indicate a remarkable cultural unity across South Siberia not only during the ogy and Geomorphology of Northern Asia: Selected Works , edited by Henry N.

There remains the possibility that the antlerless elk represented on the South Siberian rock images are young males or males in antlerless state, that is between mid-winter and early spring when new antlers commence growth. Since, however, there is no apparent reason for particular signification to be accorded the antlerless male, this paper will continue to as- sume that an antlerless elk is intended as a female.</page><page sequence="17">84 ESTHER JACOBSON neolithic, but also into the Bronze Age.

As is always the case with this primitive medium, it is precisely the chronological ordering of images and composi- tions which is most fraught with difficulties: without clearly associated excavated sites, dating becomes based on relative developments within the same complex, on comparisons between complexes, and on parallels with far-flung representations which may have more certain archaeologi- cal associations (e. g., the carvings from Bazaikha). It is through such comparative studies that Okladnikov has developed a chronological or- dering of rock representations along the Tom, Angara and Lena, as well as at other Siberian sites. This chronology, as well as relevant objec- tions, will be referred to in the context of the following discussion. Okladnikov divides the rock carvings of the Tom river basin into four groups.33 The earliest is datable to the beginning of the Neolithic, which Okladnikov places in the sixth -fifth millennium B.C.; it includes the largest representations of female elk, e. g., those from Stone III [Fig. 14]. These early figures, with shaded-in heads, outlined bodies and four legs, are followed by the second group, dated to the fourth - third millennium, including life-size representations of female elk, now embel- lished by striping across part or all of their bodies [Fig. 15]. In the striping and treatment of legs, they recall the clumsier, less life-like images from the Tagil images, dated to the late third or second millen- nium B.C. by Černecov. These Tom river images are silent testimony to the ability of early artists to observe and reproduce the specific charac- ter of that animal: its powerful body and movement, its great head, chest and withers. Less impressive, even clumsy, are the often schematic representations of elk which Okladnikov includes in the third chronologi- cal stage. Typified by images from the Novoromanov group [Fig. 16], these four-legged profiles are occasionally given a kind of internal anatomy. They retain the antlerless heads, great ears and distinctive bell suggesting a continuation of a cult focusing on the female elk. With 33 Okladnikov and A. I.

This group includes ithyphallic and often bird-headed anthropomorphic figures scattered among (but presumably done later than) the great elk representations of earlier periods [Fig. 17]. One stick-like figure [Fig. 17e] Okladnikov relates to anthropomorphic figures on ceramic sherds from the Tom region Samus IV site, dated to the second half of the second millennium B.C.35 [Fig. 18]. Finally, on Stone VII from the Tom river group appear a number of what Okladnikov calls "elk", done in the schematic, crude style he believes indicative of late Neolithic in this region.36 These ani- mals, however, have elongated antlers, and are far more suggestive of reindeer than of bull moose. The representations are, unfortunately, too crude to allow certain identification. Representations of cervids, boats, solar disks and anthropomorphic figures clearly associate these image groups with those from Scan- dinavia, Karelia and the Urals. Okladnikov^ chronological ordering from single huge representations of elk, to representations of many life-size elk, to representations of schematic figures joined with boats and disks, and, finally, to the appearance of anthropomorphic figures is reasonable when considered against what is understood of the chronological de- velopment of Scandinavian petroglyphs. Whether or not the earliest im- ages can be placed as far back as the sixth- fifth millennium B.C. is certainly open to question.37 Okladnikov is not able to offer any reliable data for or against his dating scheme, though the Bazaikha and Gor- bunovo carved figures would suggest that his second group (of life-size, realistic figures) should be dated to the second millennium B.C. rather than earlier. The Samus IV ceramic pieces also support a date in the latter second millennium for the appearance of the anthropomorphic, animal-headed figures. Yet however one adjusts the relative dating, the material from the Tom rock carvings, like that from Karelia, indicates an early and long-lived cult centered on the cervid, specifically on the female elk; and a later displacement of that focus by rituals which neces- 35 V.

The great carvings and drawings on the cliffs along along the Angara river indicate that a cult of the female elk existed even further east in neolithic Siberia and that it was displaced only when a shamanic culture emerged in the early Bronze Age, i. e. latter second millennium B.C. The Angara images include all the types found at the Tom river, and several more.38 Okladnikov refers the large representations of elk along the Angara to the neolithic, characterizing them as marked by "one general style, a unique monumental realism."39 Done in an outline or filled-in style, the large elk from Stone Island II and III [Figs. 19-21] echo the vitality of the animal observed which characterized the great elk representations from the Tom river. Moving from left to right, the hump of the back and bend of the legs suggesting the graceful power of this animal, virtually all are female, although occasionally there may be represented a young bull. At both Stone Island II and III, there also appear representations of female elk with legs folded under, as if at rest [Figs. 19 and 21]. These images suggest that signification resided in the animal itself rather than in the animal only in a particular movement. (They also introduce a possibly ancient precedent for the Scythian re- cumbent stag.) Among the elk appear occasional images of what Oklad- nikov calls fish, but which seem more correctly identifiable as the Baikal or ringed seal, known to inhabit the waters of Lake Baikal and the upper Angara.40 At the same sites, beside and among the elk images, one finds others which were certainly added at a later time: from Stone Island II, an ithyphallic figure on skis or snowshoes and rows of frontal "dancing" figures [Figs. 20, 22a]; and, from Stone Island III, crosses, circles, verti- cal stripes, boats and strange frontal figures with horned headdresses and striped bodies [Figs. 22d, e, 23a]. However crude in execution, this combination of elements calls to mind parallel combinations from the early Bronze Age petroglyphs of Bohuslän - a parallel which tends to support Okladnikov's contention that the appearance of boats, crosses and anthropomorphic figures represents that point at which the neolithic 38 Okladnikov, Petroglify Angary, (M-L., 1966). 39 Ibid., p. 80. 40 S.

It is at Manzja, as well as at Kamenka, that one finds a significant transition from an early to a late Bronze Age complex within the Angara region.

This cluster of motifs, marked by the appearance of cauldrons and riders, indicates the coming of the Iron Age: a period dominated by nomadic stock-breeders and agriculturalists who briefly left their traces in a region too forested to permit permanent residence for any but hun- ters and fishers. The evidence of the rock representations suggests, however, that the appearance of mounted riders and cauldrons suc- ceeded that of horned anthropomorphic figures; that representations of the latter succeeded that of the great images of female elk; and that boats, disks, and crosses seem transitional between the anthropomor- phic figures and the mounted riders. Finally, evidence from the Angara cliffs would indicate that antlered cervids emerged as significant cultural symbols sometime between the demise of the cult of female elk and the appearance of mounted riders. The region between the Angara river and Lake Baikal is bisected by another great Siberian river, the Lena, whose upper and middle reaches are marked by numerous carvings and drawings.43 At Tal'ma [Fig. 27a] and Vorob'eva [Fig. 28] large elk recall the monumental realism of im- ages from the Tom river and from Stone Islands II and III. Particularly impressive are the two large animals from Vorob'evo which move from right to left, the bull described with a kind of internal anatomy similar to the anatomical treatment of elk from the Tom river Tutal'skaja carv- ings.44 This animal, however, and several from Tal'ma are bull elk. If the TaPma and Vorob'evo images represent an eastern extension of a neolithic cult focussed on the female elk, then the appearance at these sites of bulls indicates either a local variation or, perhaps, a different and 42 Ibid., pl. 171, 172 and p. 141. 43 Okladnikov and V.

Such an "anatomical" treatment of cervids is not, of course, unique to Russian and Siberian rock representations. Anatomical drawings can be found throughout Norwegian rock-carvings; that of an elk from Oppland [Fig. 9] is particularly reminiscent of the Tutal'skaja and Vorob'evo formulations.</page><page sequence="26">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 93 Fig. 25: Cauldrons, crosses, disk and crescent from Manzja, Angara river.

This latter group [Fig. 27b] comprises dots, short vertical stripes, some animals (?) and a number of frontal figures, arms and legs outstretched, with horned headdresses and triangular torsos. The figures, so reminiscent of those from Stone Island II [Fig. 22b, c], seem to be later versions of the horned anthropomorphic images which overlay several of the elk further to the left on the same rock face,46 and which vividly recall horned figures from Manzja and Kamen- ka, as well as those from the ceramic sherds of Samus IV. Okladnikov dates the large elk representations from Cliff 9 at Tal'ma to the early Neolithic period.47 If he is correct, one must assume that in this region the Neolithic elk cult included both male and female, while further to the west it included only the female animal. Indeed, except for the appearance of bull elk, it would seem that the monumental realism of the Tal'ma, Vorob'evo and Čuru elk belongs to the same chronological horizon as the great elk images from Stone Islands II and III and those from the Tom river cliffs. The horned figures would then represent the early Bronze Age and the more triangular frontal figures accompanied by dots and stripes might presumably represent a still later phase. Re- lated to these images on the upper Lena are several along the west shore of Lake Baikal. Belonging to the same forested zone, they indicate yet more clearly a transition from the shamanic culture of the early Bronze Age to that of the hunter and mounted horsemen of the late Bronze and early Iron Age. Above the Baikal bay of Sagan-zaba is a large group of images, seemingly done over a period of perhaps several hundred years. First described and sketched by T. I. Savenkov [Fig. 30] in 1925, they were restudied and traced by Okladnikov and colleagues in 1968.48 In both versions, the left and center of the large group are dominated by horned figures with large triangular torsos. Arranged frontally, their bent legs and gesturing arms suggestive of figures dancing,49 such im- ages directly recall similar figures from Bolšaja-kada and Manzja [Fig. 46 See the schematic drawing of the whole cliff 9, Tal'ma (Okladnikov, 1977, p. 28). 47 Ibid., p. 117. 48 Okladnikov, Petroglify Bajkala , (Novosibirsk, 1974), p. 17. Although the redrawing of the proup of images differs in details from that of Savenkov (cf. ibid., pls. 9, 10; 11, 12), the differences are not decisive. 49 Okladnikov relates these figures to the shamanic dances still practiced among Eastern Siberian peoples, in which the most important part of the body is the torso.

Savenkov, 1925 from rock representation at Sagan-zaba, Lake Baikal. After Okladnikov, 1974. 23b, c], as well as the simpler figures from the Samus IV ceramic sherds. On the basis of these similarities, as well as on the basis of finds from a Glazkovo period site (dated ca. 1500-1300 B.C.) near the cliff, Oklad- nikov proposes a date in the second millennium for this image group.50 Scattered among the large dancing figures are small and large cervids, almost all facing to the right and antlered. Long-necked water birds are found on the right side of the large group. In Savenkov's version, three small stick figures can be seen on the right side of the cliff complex, while in Okladnikov's version only one such figure has been recorded. These figures, related by similar figures from Kamenka and Manzja [Fig. 24] to the cauldron, cross, and spiral motifs, must date later than the horned figures with triangular torsos. At least one of the stags recorded on the right side of Okladnikov's sketch and possibly the great stag recorded on the left center of Savenkov's are reindeer. Other stag images suggest a subgenus of the red deer, such as the Altai wapiti (C. e. asiaticus). Both versions of the Sagan-zaba image group record the presence of a large antlered recumbent stag on the far right; and Savenkov's earlier documentation indicates the presence, at the top, of two mounted horse- men. That on the left, lifting a readied bow and riding a long-necked horse, is probably a later addition, belonging to the Kurikan period. The horseman on the right, however, may well be contemporaneous with the recumbent stag and with the stick figures on the right side of the com- position. Considered against the cultural progression indicated by the 50 Ibid., pp. 72, 74-75.</page><page sequence="31">98 ESTHER JACOBSON Tom, Angara and Lena rock representations, this at Sagan-zaba appears to reflect a transition within the Siberian Bronze Age, from the late second millennium B.C., when the dominant image had become a horned anthropomorphic figure (most likely that of a shaman), through into the first-half of the first millennium B.C., when shamanic cults became indi- cated by rows of dancing figures accompanied by the birds and antlered cervids which were at once helping spirits and - to judge from the mounted riders - also a source of communal sustenance. A cultural transition into the late Bronze Age is decisively indicated by rock carvings found at Mt. Sakhjurtê, on the north shore of the Anga river, a short distance before it joins Lake Baikal at the Usť Anga bay.51 In one section, a clumsy hunter with readied bow stands together with a group of cervids, the antlers, heads and bodies of which suggest elk, a maral and possibly reindeer [Fig. 31]. Recognizable as these animals are, they have little of that immediacy and vitality found in the great neolithic representations of elk along the Tom, Angara and Lena rivers. Here they appear in the guise of prey, standing as if ready to be taken by the hunter. It is, in fact, this very quiescence of stance which suggests that although the scene may take the appearance of a hunt, it is only the hunt as symbol: the very number of the stags, their formalized position- ing, indicates that the scene has to do with a statement of belief rather than of fact, a statement in which the terms of discourse are now drawn from the essential relationship of hunter and prey.

Like all the Selenga river rock representations reported by Okladnikov and Zaparožskaja,53 this composition may be dated to the first half of the first millennium B.C. Although the Butikha composition uses the hunt as symbol, most of the Selenga and related rock images in northern Mongolia54 are dominated by other motifs: scenes of stockherding; frontal figures which seem to Fig. 32: Hunter and bull elk from rock carving at Butikha, Selenga river, Trans- baikal.

Okladnikov dates these images by reference to what he considers Karasuk-type knives gathered in the Irkutsk and Transbaikal regions as well as by reference to the Transbaikal slab graves of the late Bronze Age.55 There certainly exists an undeniable similarity between the rows of birds and ungulates found here along the Selenga river, and those on a number of the Karasuk knives.56 Nonethe- less, it is still unclear when these Karasuk knives were produced - in the early or late Bronze Age - or where. Furthermore, the fact that on several of these knives appear motifs not found in the Selenga represen- tations but characteristic of South Siberian and Mongolian Scythian art - predators, predators with prey, stylized goat heads and backturned Fig. 33: Figures, birds, dots and enclosures from rock carving at DurbuPžin, northern Mongolia.

The stick figures in rows and the dots and stripes, on the other hand, hark back to those at Stone Island II, Stone Island III, and the schematic frontal figures at Kamenka; while the motif of the bird-of-prey could be found previously, at Kamenka [Fig. 26]. A composition similar to that at Butikha occurs at Durburdžin on the Tola river, about 140 km. west of Ulan-bator [Fig. 34]. 58 The stags in this otherwise simple hunting composition are strikingly reminiscent of Scythian stags with exaggerated antlers. A more impressive grouping of cervids has been found at Nêmêkhê, next to the cliff of Ikhê-alik, also west of Ulan-bator.59 Neither Dorž's description nor the photograph of the Nêmêkhê group allow one to know if there is a hunter present in the scene; but the magnificently antlered stags are certainly conceptual an- cestors of the Čiliktin and even Kostromskaja stags. Dorž follows Borov- ka in dating this composition to the Scytho-Siberian period, doubtless on the basis of the stags. A group of images on the Katun river in the Altai, one of a number scattered along the shore for a distance of about ten kilometers, shows at least two hunters on foot, a large antlered animal (elk or reindeer?), and two, possibly three, cervids recumbent with heads turned back.60 Okladnikova calls this a scene of a hunt after elk and tentatively dates it to the early Iron Age, by association with the Fig. 34: Hunt scene, from Durbul'žin, northern Mongolia.

Such an association is not convincing, however; the back- turned animals certainly call to mind a conventional stylization in Scy- thian art, including that of Pazyryk; but one finds here none of that ferocity of the attack nor the fascination with the fantastic which is such a strong element in the art of Pazyryk and other Altaic kurgāns of the Scythian period. It would seem safer to date this group as well as those from Durbul'džin and Nêmêkhê, to the pre-Pazyryk period, but within the late Bronze Age. Okladnikova has also reported a group of images from the valley of the Dalangaš, in Gorno Altai, near the border of that autonomous region and Mongolia.61 Included among the Dalangaš rock carvings (some of which unquestionably belong to a later, even Kurikan date) is a scene of a figure aiming his bow at two or more deer, one of which has elongated antlers. Okladnikova also reproduces a curiously long-nosed stag with elaborated antlers and legs bent forward [Fig. 35a]. This stag, and others from the same site with great curving reindeer antlers [Fig. 35b] bear comparison with Scythian representa- tions of the cervid. In contrast to those of hunting scenes, these animals are shown in a formalized isolation, apparently having required neither an obvious activity (hunting) nor careful realism to have had meaning. Possibly the most impressive gathering of cervids can be found at Čuruk-maldigkhaja, Barun-khemčik,62 in Tuva, a region bordering on both the Gorno Altai and Mongolia and in which the tradition of reindeer herding has continued up to the present. The variety of animals portray- 61 Okladnikova, "Naskal'nye risunki v doline r. Dalangaš," Pervobytnoe iskus- stvo, edited by R. S. VasiPevskij (Novosibirsk, 1976), pp. 83 -96. Okladnikova's reporting of this group of images leaves a number of questions unresolved: questions regarding the relationship of each group of images to the others, the extent to which the isolation in which a number of the figures are shown is an actual reflection of the original compositions and the matter of absolute chronolo- gy. Okladnikova refers to the "pre-Saka" period (late second-early first millen- nium B.C.) groups of cattle done in what she calls the "shaded" style and rep- resentations of carts and wheels (p. 94). To the Saka period she assigns some scenes of goats, horses and animal attacks, the last of which recall the theme of animal confrontations from Pazyryk (figs. 8b, 9). To the Turkic period (VI- VIII c. A. D.) she assigns some scenes in which there are apparently included human figures. The Dalangaš images, and particularly those of long-headed stags with elabo- rated antlers, should be compared with those of Khobd-somon in Gobijskij Altai. See A. P.

The easy gathering of the animals, several of which are recumbent, recalls a similar assurance and grace in the images from Sagan-Zaba. Here, however, side-by-side with cervids appear camel and ibex, attest- ing to the fact that this region borders steppe land from which emerged nomadic stockbreeders. Included in the images on the rock face is a simple representation of a figure on horseback, and at least one of a crude figure aiming a bow at a large stag. Assuming that these human figures were made contemporaneously with those of the cervids, the composition parallels those from Sakhiurtê, Butikha and Durbul'džin. The lack of isolated, exaggerated stags as well as the lack of animals of prey, animal confrontations and fantastic animals argues for a date ear-</page><page sequence="37">104 ESTHER JACOBSON lier than that represented by the great Altai kurgāns of the Scythian period. This grouping of cervids, moreover, like those from Sakhiurtê, Butikha, Durbul'džin and Dalangaš, betrays no delight in the hunt as confrontation. The Kunin rock representations [Fig. 37], along the upper Yenisei, are reliably dated by K. V. Vjatkina to the Tagar period, ca. VII -II c.

Also joining the Kunin carvings to the Scytho- Siberian tradition is the appearance of an animal with twisted croup [Fig. 37e: # 5], a stylization which may have been borrowed from Achaemenid formulations but which became quite typical of Scythian art. Stylistic differences indicate that the Kunin carvings refer to a number of different periods. But in those compositions which relate to Tagar traditions, one finds three significant motifs: that of horned and armed human figures, sometimes seemingly warriors, sometimes seem- ingly shamans; horses and cattle, testifying to the importance of stock in the lives of the people; and cervids, male and female, standing, running and recumbent. In a number of the compositions including stock and cervids, there also appear frontal birds-of-prey. These bird images clear- ly suggest a relationship with the Selenga river images, just as they recall the omnipresent eagle-griffon motif from the great Altai kurgāns. It is difficult to understand the meaning of the scenes with cervids. They certainly do not appear to refer to a hunt: in one composition [Fig. 37d], the animals all face peaceably to the right, where appear two figures with headdresses, one of whom seems to be hitting the other on the head with a long hammer-like instrument. In another composition with many cervids [Fig. 37b], there are a number of frontal figures, some with horned headdresses, all recalling in their clumsiness the rows of figures from the Selenga river as well as the figures from cliff 9 at TaPma, on the Lena river [Figs. 27, 33]. There is no suggestion of a hunt, or of any other confrontation. In fact, the general lack of indications of the animal attack (with the exception of the confrontation of two lion-griffons [Fig. 37a: #29, 30] - such a dominant feature in the Scytho-Siberian traditions represented by the remains of Pazyryk and by the Treasure of Peter the Great) raises the possibility that those Kunin compositions with deer, birds and horned figures should be dated very early in the Tagar period, if not in the pre-Tagar period, the confronting lion-griffons presaging the coming Pazyryk period. One of the Kunin compositions (not represented here) includes two elaborately antlered stags and a yurt-like structure with crossed poles emerging from the top center. This motif associates the culture from which emerged the Kunin rock carvings with that which was responsible 64 Ibid., p. 233, XLII-49.</page><page sequence="40">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 107 for the late Tagar Great Boyar petroglyph, in the Khakass Autonomous Oblast, directly northwest of Tuva. The Great Boyar cliff [Fig. 36] is located on the Sukhaja-tes river which flows from the west into the Yenisey about halfway between Abakan in the south and the 55' latitude, on the north.65 A number of frequently recurring motifs allow the dating of the Great Boyar composition: the "horned" yurt-like structures; the log structures - also horned - which appear to reproduce the log struc- tures known from Pazyryk and other Altai kurgāns; the distinctively Scythian cauldrons, noted earlier on the Manzja rock representation and the appearance of animals, several in typical Scythian recumbent pose, in connection with men. On the basis of these chipped-out images, Dêvlet concludes that one has to do with a society highly dependent on stock- breeding, and that the most important animals for these people were yak, long-horned cattle of the aurochs type, horses, great horned sheep, goats and reindeer.66 While the basis for Dévleťs identification of yak is unclear,67 the sheep, goats and cattle are quite obvious and their proxim- ity to both structures and human figures clearly indicates their use as herd animals. Two figures riding horses in the vicinity of a herd of deer also indicate the extent to which these stockbreeders were mounted. Most interesting is the herd of deer itself, of which one large stag is being ridden: an indication that these deer could only be reindeer. The Great Boyar composition is an irrefutable document establishing the herding and riding of reindeer far earlier than has hitherto been sup- posed;68 and the riding of reindeer would suggest an already long estab- 65 M.

Kiselev refers to the theories of Hahn, Laufer and A. N. Maximov, according to which reindeer riding derived from cattle and horse breeding, and contrasts those theories with that of G. N. Prokoviev, according to which rein- deer herding had great antiquity and cannot be considered merely a local variant of cattle and horse herding. See S. V. Kiselev, Drevnjaja istorija južnoj Sibiři , [Moscow, 1951], pp. 375-76. Berthold Laufer refers to the Chinese historical account (in the Annals of the Liang dynasty) that in 499 A.D. the Buddhist monk</page><page sequence="41">108 ESTHER JACOBSON lished symbiotic relationship between reindeer herds and human com- munities in this region. It also reveals that here, adjacent to the steppe- land of South Siberia, reindeer herding was a major part of the economy within the early Iron Age, just as it has continued to be a major part of the life of the Tuvintsi, in neighboring Tuva, up until the present.69 The combination of sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer and yurts indicates an economy and culture based on transhumance, while the log huts imply a permanent or semi-permanent base (as in the valley). The Great Boyar images reflect a society in which reindeer existed as a part of the economic base side-by-side with cattle, horses, and smaller animals. We say "economic," but it is also possible that the reindeer had a more religious significance: that it appears here not simply as a herd animal, but possibly even as a cultic reference to the past, to an economy based more completely on reindeer and less on sheep and cattle, and to a period in which its value within the culture was more central, both religiously and economically. The combination of men on horseback and cervids has already been proposed (as in the case of Kamenka and Čuruk-maldig- khaja) as indicative of a late Bronze and early Iron Age date. Equally important at the Great Boyar, are the large stick-like frontal figures, several of a definitely ithyphallic character. These figures are echoes of those at Kamenka and Manzja, and of the frontal dancing figures from Sagan-zaba and the Selenga river [Figs. 24, 30, 33]. They join the Great Huei Shen (sic) visited a place called Fu-sang - which Laufer places in the Baikal region - where people rode vehicles drawn by horses, cattle and stags and milked deer. Laufer believes, however, that reindeer herding and milking could not have developed much earlier than that period. See Laufer, "The Rein- deer and its Domestication," Memoirs of the American Anthropological Associ- ationy IV (1917), 102-103. V. I. Skalon has argued that the stag stones (see below) in the Altai, Mongolia, Tuva and Baikal regions, as well as botanical and geological evidence, indicate that in the late Bronze and early Iron Ages the climate of South Siberia and North Mongolia was considerably wetter than it is today, and that the region of the Sayan mountains was the birthplace of reindeer domestication. See Skalon "Olennye kamni Mongolii i problema proiskhoždenija olenovodstvo," SA XXV [1956], 87-105. Although he does not make any at- tempt to determine a chronological horizon for the development of reindeer herding, riding and milking, Gudmund Hatt's "Notes on Reindeer Nomadism", Memoirs of the American Anthropological Association , VI, #2 [1919], 75-133, remains the most useful and pertinent discussion of the possible origins of rein- deer herding in Northern Europe and Siberia. 69 M.

These are the stag stones which have been found in Tuva, the Altai, North Mongolia and the Transbaikal. The stag stones are exem- plified by those found at Uškiin-uver [Fig. 38], near Muren, in the region of North Mongolia which lies just west of Lake Baikal71 as well as that known as the I volga stone [Fig. 39], found on the I volga river, south of Ulan-ude on the road to Selenginsk.72 The stones range in size from less than two to more than three meters tall and were once erected into the soil like great road markers. Both the Uškiin-uver and I volga stones are covered - front, back and sides - with representations of elongated stags with elaborated antlers. Characteristically, the stags have drawn- out, almost bill-like heads, great round eyes, and conventionally trun- cated legs, each a more elegant version of one stag at Dalangaš [Fig. 35a]. As if afraid of leaving any space unfilled, the carvers of the stones placed small stags, horses and confronting beasts between the larger stags. A dating in the early Tagar period (VII through V c.

At Khongor-bator, Khusotuj and Ul'ba, between the Selenga river and Lake Baikal, have been found a number of large stones, most now broken and toppled, on one of which is carved a large and realistic reindeer [Fig. 40b]. On another stone from Khongor-bator, are four large animals, including one bull and two cow elk [Fig. 40a].

The more direct treat- ment, in which the upright cervid is rendered as observed rather than subordinated to a decorative intention, may be associated with stag stones from Tuva reported by Appelgren-Kivalo.75 On one of the Tuva stones are carved reindeer, elk (including one recumbent female) and a horse while on another the figures refer to either maral or reindeer. The simplicity and rationality of depiction - here, as on the Transbaikal stones, the animals are upright - as well as the lack of representation of weapons indicate a different, certainly earlier, date than that assigned the more elaborate Ivolga type of stone.76 Nonetheless, all these stones share another element in common: all refer in the shape of the stone and in parts of its carving to a male figure. A stag stone from Suš, Tuva, for example,77 has a belt with hanging weapons carved at the "waist" and a small horned mask carved at the top. Several of the stones from Uškiin- uver similarly have belts and human heads on one side, a "mirror" on the other. The Ivolga stone carries weapons, a mirror and strange circles at the top. Členova has proposed that the stag stones of Mongolia and Siberia should be related to statuettes of warriors associated with Scyth- ians in the Pontic region. She theorizes that the stag stones with rudimentary anthropomorphic reference are, in fact, intended to repre- 74 Okladnikov and Zaporožskaja, 1970, II, pl. 86. 75 Grač, figs. 13, 14. The writing on both stones dates from a later, post- Scythian period. 76 The problem of dating is made more complex by a number of recent publica- tions to which I had no access before the writing of this paper. On some of the stones used in the construction of the Aržan kurgan, Tuva (dated by Griaznov to the Vili- VII c. B.C.) are representations of upright, antlered cervids. On one stone, in particular, appear reindeer, "on tiptoe," in association with Maimir- type boar and representations of weapons hanging as if from a belt [M. P. Griaz- nov, Aržan: carskii kurgan ranneskifskogo vremeni, (Leningrad, 1980), fig. 29/ 2]. Stylistically, the reindeer here, with their angled withers and with the scrol- ling over shoulders and hips, stand between the Khongor-bator and Ivolga and Uškiin-uver cervid types. For discussion of the complexity of dating Aržan and related material, see Ja. A. Šer, Petroglifi / Srednej i CentraVnoj Azii , (Moscow, 1980), pp. 247-251. Compare, also, the above mentioned Aržan reindeer with the bronze cervid from Ujgarak (footnote #12). 77 Členova, "Ob olennykh kamnjakh Mongolii i Sibirii," Mongol' skij ar- kheologičeskij sborníky (Moscow, 1962) p. 31, fig. 6/2.</page><page sequence="46">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 113 sent warrior leaders who wore on their clothes their totemic image, the stag. The appearance of the stag stones in Mongolia and Tuva implies the appearance of these foreign, Saka, warriors in that region, the great stag representations indicating their need to underline their totemic identity.78 This argument supports her theory that the origin of the stag image lies somewhere in the region of Central Asia and Eastern Kazak- stan. Lending it credence is the appearance of weapons, frequently carved as if hanging down from a belt. More cogent, still, is the parallel between the stag images on the stones and the fact that the Scythians wore their gold and bronze plaques sewn onto their clothing or attached to their shields and weapons. If we examine the stag stones more close- ly, however, we find that they fail to support Členova's theory regarding the origins of the stag image and of Scythian art in general. First, it should be noted that no such stones - anthropomorphic or otherwise - have been found in pre-Turkic Central Asia. Secondly, the well known stone baba from the Pontic region, dated to the Scythian period,79 are not ornamented with stags or with any other animal images, although we know for a fact that the Pontic Scythians emblazoned clothing and shields with gold and bronze zoomorphic plaques. By contrast, students of Siberian antiquities have long been familiar with the enigmatic stone baba from the Minusinsk valley, dated first by Griaznov to the An- dronovo period (mid-second millennium B.C.),80 but now generally be- lieved to date to the earlier Okunov culture which covered the Yenisey- Altai-Tuva region in the early second millennium B.C.81 These great stelae were generally representative of female figures, often of a patent- ly magical kind, sometimes clearly referring to the female as vessel of fertility but also frequently carrying horned animals, probably also re- lated to fertility rites. It is doubtful whether one can claim a direct connection between these Okunov stelae and the South Siberian - North Mongolian stag stones; but the former do suggest a tradition out of which the latter might have developed, just as the South Siberian rock carvings and drawings indicate an ancient tradition of cervid representa- tion on the cliffs over great rivers. Finally, the stag stones reported by 78 Ibid. 79 See N. G. Elagina, "Skifskie antropomorfnie steli Nikolaevskogo Muzeja," SA, 1959, #2, pp. 187-196. 80 M. N.

The phallic shape of the stones, on which are superimposed realistic standing images of cervids, leads one to the hypothesis that by the early first millennium B.C. the ant- lered animal - elk, reindeer or maral - had become associated with and symbolic of the male, male power and fertility and therefore of tribal well-being. These changes coincided, as we have seen, with the replace- ment of the neolithic cult of the female elk by a religious world-view dominated by shamanic beliefs and practices. A concern with the sym- bols of male power, however, as an invocation of tribal well-being is distinctly a pre-Iron Age condition. The coming of the Iron Age in Siberia was measured by the rise of nomadic stockbreeding peoples who aggressively began to seize land across the Eurasian steppes. Their strength lay in horses, in stock, and in weapons; and, to judge from grave finds across Eurasia as well as from the writings of Herodotus, they were warriors par excellence . Thus the Khongor-bator, Ivolga and Uškiin-uver stones, their phallic and anthropomorphic shapes offering testimony of a transition from shamanic to warrior culture, are more convincingly understood as documenting the transformation of a native, not foreign, culture as it passed from the Bronze into the Iron Age. They also mark the final stages in the journey of the symbolic stag image, affording clear connections between the antlered cervids of the Bronze Age cliff images and the Scythian plaques of bronze and gold in which a once realistic and monumental animal became stylized, isolated from a natural environment, reduced to a totemic sign. If Bronze Age Central Asia and the Pontic region offer little evidence for the origins of the Scythian stag image, there exists no such lack in the case of Siberia. From the early Neolithic period down through the Bronze and into the Iron Age, South Siberian rock representations and stag stones document religious beliefs and world views which continu- ously involved the cervid. Commencing in the form of a female elk, a primary indicator of well-being within Neolithic society, the elk became transformed in the Bronze Age into an antlered animal: bull elk, rein- deer, or maral. By the Iron Age, the cervid was replaced in importance by animals more central to the new economic reality of nomadic stock- breeding: horses, sheep, goats and cattle. Bronze Age visions of sym-</page><page sequence="48">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 115 bolic hunts (represented, for example, at Čuruk-maldig-khaja) were also replaced in Scythian art by images of force and aggression: animals and birds of prey, often savaging cervids or wild sheep; representations of warriors, mounted and confident. It should now be clear that despite Členova's insistence on the identity of the Scythian stag image and the noble (red) deer, many of the Scyth- ian gold, bronze and wooden plaques were certainly reflective of fallow deer, reindeer, or elk (see Appendix). We have seen, moreover, that the cervid images on Bronze and Iron Age rock carvings and stag stones were frequently of reindeer or elk, or simply impossible to identify be- yond the generic "stag" or "cervid". The ancient Siberians were no more reluctant to stylize, to reduce specific image to type, than any other people. A modern Siberian example of such stylization is illuminating: on a backboard to a Keti woman's reindeer sled published by Levin and Potapov,82 are carved two elegantly linear stags; lacking long hair under the throat and the single, shovel-tine over the brow characteristic of the reindeer, they appear to be some type of red deer. Yet the Keti inhabit a region in northcentral Siberia where the only cervids are reindeer; in- deed, until very recently the Keti were totally dependent on this animal for food, clothing, shelter, and transport. The images on the backboard are reindeer, but simplified. The all-important antlers are stylized into tree-like branches in which the scientific specificity of the reindeer is generalized into the beauty of symbolic form. This modern backboard emphasizes the paradoxical possibility so much earlier suggested by the Lena, Baikal and Great Boyar rock carvings: that the ancestor of the Kostromskaja and Čiliktin stags may well have been the reindeer - somewhat ungainly at rest, an image of grace in movement, the direct source of warmth and life for many early peoples in the frozen tundra and open taiga of Siberia.83 In concluding this discussion, one final question must be addressed: how do we join Siberian origins for the Scythian stag image to the fact that the historical Scythians presumably emerged from the Shrubnaja culture? Though the latter may be related back to Siberia through the Andronovo, why do we find no evidence of a cervid cult in the material 82 Levin and Potapov, p. 692. 83 Adolph Erman, who traveled on a scientific mission through Siberia in the early nineteenth century, gives a vivid description of the reindeer-dependent peoples of the Ob-Yenisey region of Siberia ( Travels in Siberia , [London, 1848], II, 26-56).</page><page sequence="49">116 ESTHER JACOBSON remains of either culture? Either all pertinent material evidence has been lost, or the assumption of Scythian roots in the Shrubnaja culture is simply incorrect. We have been led astray by Herodotus, whose account of the Scythians' advent accords nicely with some archeological evidence regarding burial rites and stockbreeding. A third alternative proposes a compromise position: Herodotus's Scythians may indeed have come out of Shrubnaja or Andronovo roots, but image-making was revitalized out of a distant past when the need emerged to have a common standard vis- à-vis the challenged settled civilizations of the Near East. Or, as a fourth alternative, one may consider the possibility that the Shrubnaja culture was transformed into that of the Scythians only when a related An- dronovo group, coming from the region of Eastern Kazakhstan, South Siberia and northern Mongolia, reached the Near East, joined forces with their cultural cousins, gave them back - in a sense - their ancest- ral images and catalyzed the appearance of the Scythians in surviving art.84 This last alternative satisfies the arguments of the material at hand, discussed at length in the foregoing papers. It also satisfies Členova's requirement that the origin of the Scythian stag image be east of Iran proper (although it carries that originating point much further east and north than she would support). Finally, it is raised as a remind- er that we simply have no certainty the Scythians came out of the Shrub- naja culture nor do we have any archeological evidence to deny flatly the last alternative. In the last analysis, and until more archeological evi- dence emerges, a decision regarding the roots of Scythian culture in general, and of the stag image in particular, falls back into questions regarding the origins of cultures, and specifically of nomadic cultures. But to so broaden the discussion at this point would be inappropriate. We are left with an inescapable conclusion: theories regarding the origin of the Scythians must acknowledge that the primary Scythian image was distantly rooted in Siberian hunter cultures, in Neolithic cults of the female elk, and was modified only as shamanic and then militaristic and stock-dependent cultures emerged on the steppe fringes of the Siberian and Mongolian taiga. With that development, the stag finally became reduced to an ornament, a distant clan symbol, a quiet echo of the monu- mental elk which had roamed across the cliffs over the Tom, Angara and Lena rivers. 84 See footnote #11, above.</page><page sequence="50">THE SCYTHIAN STAG IMAGE 117 APPENDIX Deer, Reindeer and Elk and the Identity of the Scythian Stag The faunai basis of the Scythian stag is an essential but difficult aspect of the motifs origin. One must distinguish three relevant animals: noble deer, reindeer ("northern deer"), and elk (called, in North America, "moose").85 The noble deer, more commonly known as the red deer (Cer- vus elaphus Linnaeus) is represented by a large number of varieties, within which size, antlers and muzzle indicate a variety of specializa- tions. Thus, for example, the relatively small Bukharian red deer (Cer- vus elaphus bactrianus ), formally native to the basins of the Amu Darya, the lower Syr Darya and the western Kizil-Kum, is adapted to the sandy regions and bushy thickets of Central Asian desert and desert- steppe, as well as to the flooded thickets characteristic of this region in the springtime. Antlers are characteristically developed as a bush of five to seven tines from the main beam. By contrast, the maral or wapiti (Cervus elaphus canadensis), known confusingly in the western United States and Canada as the elk, is a large animal with massive skull and with main antler beam markedly inclined back from its skull. The maral's foretine is significantly larger than that of the Bukharian red deer and its elongated crown tines thrust sharply forward and up from its forehead. This large deer exhibits a widened nasal region, presumably an adapta- tion to its colder native region. The maral of Central Asia and Siberia can be found in hilly forested regions from the T'ien-shan and Altai through the Transbaikal and northern Mongolia. The several kinds of red deer are believed to have ranged over an enormous area in earlier times: reaching north to the 60° latitude in western Siberia and mid-central Asia and coinciding, generally, with hilly forest up even to subalpine meadow. The red deer, of whatever species, shuns regions of naked rock and stone as well as precipitous grassy slopes and regions where the yearly snow cover exceeds 40-50 cm. In Siberia they tend to follow the snows up and 85 The primary sources for the following information on deer, reindeer and elk are the relevant sections in K. K. Fiero v , Musk Deer and Deer, Fauna of the USSR : Mammals , Vol. I, No. 2, translated by the Israel Program for Scientific Translations (Jerusalem, 1960). Throughout this paper, the term red deer is used, even when referring to those Soviet sources which use the Russian desig- nation "noble" deer.</page><page sequence="51">118 ESTHER JACOBSON down mountainous slopes; but beyond such seasonal movements, the animal cannot be considered migratory. Although Členova does not define the particular subgenus of red deer most often represented in the Scythian stag image, it is probable that the most magnificent images reflect the maral. Of all the subgroups of C. e. Linnaeus , it is this one which most closely calls to mind the Eura- sian reindeer, Rangifer tarandus. A relatively large deer, recalling the maral in its mature mane and in the pronounced hump at the withers, the reindeer exhibits a number of distinguishing characteristics: its large head is marked by a much broader nasal region than that of the maral, its hoofs are wide and flat to facilitate travel over snowy tundra, and the rack of a mature male is developed into broadened and highly curved main beams, posterior beams and a great flattened forehead tine which juts out over the length of the face. Rangifer tarandus is the only cervid the female of which bears antlers, albeit not as elaborated as those of the mature male. Until recently, the reindeer was known as far south as 52° north latitude in the Urals. Beyond the Urals, the limit of its range generally follows the 59° north latitude, intersecting the region of the Irtysh river and then turning south to enter the Altai where it is fairly widely spread. It is also widespread in the region of the Sayan mountains of South Siberia, known in the upper Lena region, and fairly common in the mountains and taiga around Lake Baikal. According to Flerov's esti- mation of reindeer distribution in Eurasia, at an earlier time it covered an immense area from the northernmost reaches of Siberia into north Russia and Scandinavia; down far south of the Baikal and through the Sayan and Altai into and through North Mongolia. As late as the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries, reindeer congregated and migrated over great areas of Siberia in herds ranging up to many thousands.86 The third cervid mentioned by Členova is the elk (Alces alces Lin- naeus), the largest and most solitary of all deer. Highly specialized for habitation in forest and taiga but avoiding regions of deep snow, elk formerly ranged widely over the European and Siberian taiga to the 86 The Siberian reindeer does not appear to be divided, as is the North Ameri- can caribou, into Woodland and Barren-land subspecies, although Flerov ack- nowledges the wide variation in anatomical adaptations. The colossal size of migrating reindeer and caribou herds, particularly up until the last century, has been noted by many writers. See, e. g., Flerov, pp. 210, 215; Ernest P.

Until recently, elk inhabited forest land as far south as the north- ern Caucasus, and possibly the western Trans-Caucasian area.87 The antlers of the male elk are characteristically developed in broad, shovel- shaped tines, although instances of more deer-like spikes are frequently encountered. Their massive skulls terminate in the highly denotative soft hump nose. Both male and female are distinguished by a hairy "bell" under their throats. It should be noted that the territory of all three cervids overlapped, in earlier times, in the forest and forest-steppe of northern Mongolia, and South Siberia; and that if any of the three inhabited the desert-steppe and hilly country of Central Asia, it could only have been the red deer. The problem of the origin of the Scythian stag motif is clearly bound to the actual identity of the image. The Kostromskaja stag, with its great antlers and relatively small and slender muzzle, indubitably refers back to one subgenus of Cervus elaphus : possibly to true red deer (C. e. elaphus Linnaeus) or to the Caspian noble or red deer (C. e. maral Ogilby). The same subgeni may be postulated for the cruder stags from Sakkiz, the Melgunow (Litoj) kurgan, Akhjutintcy, and Kul Oba, while a fine gold stag from Ak-mechet is probably based upon the fallow deer (Cervus (Dama) dama).88 The stag from Čiliktin, however, is more problematical: although referred to by Členova as a noble (red) deer and by the kurgan's excavator as a deer,89 it has more recently been iden- 87 Flerov, pp. 174-75. According to Calkin, the majority of elk bones recov- ered from early Iron Age sites of the Pontic Scythians are associated with habitation sites of the northern forest-steppe. Since, however, Calkin's analyses concern only those bones of wild and domesticated animals which have been associated with scientifically excavated sites, his conclusions lead to no clearer understanding of the actual distribution of, e.g., the elk in relationship to the distribution of, e. g., the red deer. See V. I. Calkin, Drevnee zivotnovodstvo plemen* Vostočnoj Evropy i Srednej Azii , MIA #135 [Moscow, 1966], p. 59 and passim. 88 The Sakkiz stag is one of several repeated motifs embossed on a gold plate, reproduced in Emma C. Bunker, et al., "Animal Style " Art from East to West , (New York, 1970), pl. 15. The stag from Melgunov is embossed on a gold scab- bard, reproduced in Artamonov, 1969, pl. 1. The Akhjutintcy stag is reproduced in Minns, Scythians and Greeks , (Cambridge, 1913), fig. 75; and those from Kul Oba and Ak-mechet, in Artamonov, 1969, pls. 72, 264, and 265. 89 S. S.

In fact, the power- fully articulated antlers with a single tine curving foreward over the brow and the relatively heavy head with elongated and broad muzzle could as easily refer to a reindeer as to the maral. More clearly, many of Členova's Minusinsk "stag" images are marked by a single brow tine and by a nasal region too long and full to indicate a red deer or the subgroup maral.91 In explaining the appearance of elk-like images in the Pontic region, Členova suggests that the elk was a more commonly known animal and that, therefore, the stag was given characteristics of the elk although it remained essentially a deer.92 According to this reasoning, the South Siberian stag, while referring to a maral, might have assumed characteristics of the commonly known elk and reindeer. But the argu- ment might also be turned around if one could establish that the Scythian stag was in fact based on the reindeer rather than on some Central Asian red deer. 90 From the Lands of the Scythians: Ancient Treasures from the Museums of the USSR - 3000 B.C. - 100 B.C.

I, #1) and Verkhnij Suetuk (pl. I, #18). The latter lacks a single brow tine (broken?), but is distinguished by an enlarged nasal region. Other images from unknown sites in the Minusinsk region (e. g., pl. I, #15) appear almost elk-like, with their softly enlarged noses and heavy antlers. See also pl. IV, #21, 22: bronze plaques from the Minusinsk or Yenisey region, seemingly combining elk and reindeer characteristics. 92 Ibid., p. 91.</page></plain_text>
