<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EDITED BY CLEMENT W. MEIGHAN GENERAL The following note is of general interest since it out- lines the successful prosecution of an Antiquities Act violation. Although vandalism cannot be legislated out of existence, knowledge of this case may serve as a deterrent to some relic collectors who believe that the law is never enforced. On April 30, 1953, as Consulting Archeologist for the Department of the Interior, Jesse L. Nusbaum filed with the Office of the Secretary his most conclusive Antiquities Act violation charges since 1927. He recom- mended criminal prosecution of John H. Brandt, then a student at Adams State College, Alamosa, Colorado, who had twice been warned of the consequences, for excavating, vandalizing, and removing artifacts, with the aid of 2 other students, from the largest Promontory Cave cliff dwelling in the remote Segi Ochong Canyon wilderness of the northern Navajo Reservation. The Area Director then administering the Navajo Reservation was instructed to promptly conduct the field investigation and take such legal action as findings supported. When Nusbaum protested his findings and recommendation of no criminal prosecution, only pos- sible censure, instructions were received to submit docu- mentary files on this controversial issue to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona, for his review and decision. He in turn issued the direct criminal informa- tion U.S.A. versus John Henry Brandt, No. C-3758 Pct., for violation of the Antiquities Act. On September 26, 1955, following final futile appeals to the Secretary of the Interior and General Superinten- dent Spaulding of the Central Navajo Agency to quash Nusbaum's violation charges and criminal proceedings, defendant John Henry Brandt appeared before the U.S. District Court at Phoenix, with his counsel, and entered a plea of guilty to the charges pending against him. The court thereupon fined him $100.00 and restored the confiscated artifacts to the Navajo Tribal Council. This Antiquities Act conviction is the first achieved in Ari- zona. HIGHWAY SALVAGE ARCHAEOLOGY On March 30, 1956, the Bureau of Public Roads issued a policy and procedure memorandum (No. 20-7) per- taining to the salvage of archaeological materials threat- ened with destruction by highway construction. This memorandum is of major importance to all archaeolo- gists as it provides for the use of Federal funds to pay the cost of salvaging such archaeological materials on both Federal and Federal-aid highway construction. On Federal projects, that is those highways built by the Bureau of Public Roads for other Federal agencies such as the Park Service, the Forest Service, or the Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of Public Roads will pay the full cost (archaeological supervision, labor, and equipment) of the necessary salvage excavations, al- though they will not cover the cost of looking for such ruins, shipping of archaeological material from the site, or publication. On Federal-aid projects the Bureau of Public Roads, at the request of the local State Highway Department, will pay a percentage of the cost of such archaeological salvage. This percentage is 50% in most states, but is slightly higher in the "Public lands states" in the west. In the Highway Act now pending before Congress, the Federal portion for the "Interstate System" is 90%, plus additional increments in the "Public lands states." Because of Memorandum 20-7 it is now possible for all states to initiate systematic programs of highway sal- vage archaeology. In every state a vast amount of our archaeological resources are now being destroyed by highway construction. This loss can be prevented if the archaeological institutions in each state will contact their State Highway Departments and invite their atten- tion to this memorandum, acquaint them with the need for archaeological salvage, and, finally, indicate their willingness to cooperate in the salvage excavations. The most important item of cost for the archaeological insti- tution will be paying for the search for archaeological material in the construction areas, but these costs are small when viewed against the information recovered and the financial contributions of the construction agencies. To assist in developing such programs the Society for American Archaeology has appointed a com- mittee consisting of L. S. Cressman (Northwestern States, Alaska, and Hawaii), Clifford Evans (Washing- ton, D.C., area), W. J. Keller (Bureau of Public Roads), John Mc.Gregor (Central States), Irving Rouse (North- eastern States), William Sears (Southeastern States and Puerto Rico), and Fred Wendorf (Southwestern States; Chairman). The President and Secretary of the Society are ex officio members. Individuals and institutions interested in further information should contact the committee member in their area. ARCTIC POINT BARROW. As Director of the Human Factors Project in the Bio-Mechanics Laboratory at Tufts Uni- versity, Wilbert K. Carter is now concentrating on re- search in design engineering and physical anthropology under the sponsorship of the Air Force. He is continu- ing, however, to work on his Point Barrow collections at Harvard and plans to begin publication of this mate- rial with several papers. The first of these will probably be an expanded version of "Iron Traded to Alaskan Eskimos Prior to 1000 A.D.," which he read at the No- vember, 1955, AAA meetings. ASIA. The Council for Old World Archaeology, Inc. will launch its publication program with an issue on Soviet Asia. This is scheduled to go to press this sum- 95</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mer, and it will consist of a sumary of recent field work in Soviet Asia together with a selected, annotated bibli- ography of recent Russian archaeological publications which relate specifically to that area. SOUTHAMPTON AND COATS ISLANDS. From Henry B. Collins of the Bureau of American Ethnology there is important news of the last 2 seasons of field work which he directed on Southampton and Coats islands in Hud- son Bay. In the summer of 1954 a party consisting of Collins, J. Norman Emerson, William E. Taylor, Jr., and Eugene Ostroff carried out major excavations in Dorset and Sadlermiut sites on Southampton as well as more limited investigation in a Sadlermiut site on the north shore of Coats. The work was sponsored by the Smith- sonian Institution, the National Museum of Canada, and the National Geographic Society. In 1955 Collins, Emerson, and Taylor returned with James V. Wright as the fourth member of the party, and during this season the American Philosophical Society acted as a major supporting organization. It was expected that Taylor would return for a third season's work in June, 1956. Excavations were made at 5 old sites in the vicinity of Native Point, which lies about 40 miles down the coast from Coral Harbor on the south shore of South- ampton: (1) a large Sadlermiut village, abandoned in 1903, and consisting of over 75 stone and sod house ruins and numerous stone graves, caches, and cairns; (2) the Lake Site, a smaller Sadlermiut site 2 miles to the east; (3) T-1, a large proto-Dorset site on the top of a 70-foot-high headland (the name is derived from "Tunermiut," the Aivilik Eskimo name for Native Point); (4) T-2, a small site that yielded typical Dorset material, adjacent to the Sadlermiut village; (5) T-3, another small site closely related culturally to T-l but probably a little later, situated at an elevation of 40 feet. The proto-Dorset site, T-l, comprised shallow midden deposits which covered a discontinuous area of over 30 acres. No graves or recognizable house remains were found. The midens were extremely rich in animal bones and refuse, and an analysis of the mammal bones exca- vated there, compared with those taken from the Sadler- miut site, revealed some striking differences in the food economy of the early Dorset and Sadlermiut people. The seal, for instance, was most important in both so- cieties and accounted for close to 65% of the large bone sample counted from each of the T-l and Sadlermiut sites. Walrus was next important: 12.4% of the T-1 sample and 5.3% of the Sadlermiut. Collins underlines the evidence that the proto-Dorset people made little use of caribou, 0.8%, in contrast to 11.8% for the Sad- lermiut. Fox bones were more numerous at T-1, but dog bones were completely lacking there. This latter fact shows that the proto-Dorset people, not possessing the dog sled, had no effective means of winter trans- portation, and it probably explains why they got so few caribou. Several thousand artifacts of stone, bone, and ivory were excavated at T-1, but there was no trace of wood. Some of the material is characterized by standard Dorset features and techniques of manufacture, and a number of common Dorset types were found, including needles, small triangular projectile points, slender barbed dart points, chert and nephrite implements with rubbed edges and sides, thin sherds of steatite, a few burins, and hundreds of microblades. However, the lack of some typical Dorset features, plus the fact that a major- ity of the artifacts represent new types which are limited thus far to this one site, indicate that T-1 represents a heretofore unknown phase of Dorset culture. Among the new types are long, rectangular side blades, backed blades, and microlithic triangular blades which remind Collins of Mesolithic types from Eurasia. Therefore, he believes this particular phase of the general Dorset pat- tern may best be described as formative, or proto-Dorset. A radiocarbon date of 2000 ? 230 years obtained from charred wood is consistent with this interpretation. Other evidence obtained from the excavations in Sad- lermiut sites on Coats and Walrus islands suggests that the Sadlermiut, instead of being the last of the Thule Eskimos, were a Dorset remnant with a heavy Thule overlay. KOTZEBUE SOUND. J. Louis Giddings of the University of Pennsylvania has received a grant from the Arctic Institute of North America in support of a reconnais- sance which he plans to conduct this coming August and September. He will explore both the shores and the tree line around the Escholtz Bay region of Kotzebue Sound, seeking Eskimo sites that can be dated in his Kobuk-Norton Bay treering chronology. Giddings has been building this chronology since 1940, when he first worked on the Kobuk River, and it now extends back unbroken for almost a thousand years to A.D. 978. He hopes that further exploration will help to push this lower limit back even further. CORONATION GULF. During July and August of 1955 Elmer Harp, Jr., of Dartmouth College and Ralph E. Miller of the Dartmouth Medical School conducted an airborne reconnaissance in the Coronation Gulf region of the Northwest Territories. This research was spon- sored by the American Philosophical Society and aided by a supplementary grant from the Research Committee of the Faculty of Dartmouth College. The trip was made in Miller's plane, a Piper Tripacer equipped with dual flight controls and Edo floats. Major base camps were established at Coppermine, the estuary of Tree River, the mouth of the Hood River in Artcic Sound, in Bathurst Inlet at the mouth of the Burnside River, at Contwoyto Lake on the interior barrens, and at Dis- mal Lake. From each of these bases exploratory flights were taken over the surrounding country, first at medium altitude for the bird's eye view and then at low level to scout for sites. Suitable landing areas in lakes and bays were often conveniently near those strategic locales which demanded further investigation on the ground. The light plane proved highly satis- [ XXII, 1, 1956 96</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS factory as a means of covering this type of terrain. The 2 men thought nothing of flying 100 or more miles away from camp for a day of ground work in some promising area, and then returning to base for supper at a reason- able hour. There are many logistical problems which must be solved in such an operation, but careful organi- zation and planning make it relatively safe, and the high degree of mobility is more than worth the cost. Close to 1000 miles of coastline in Coronation Gulf were flown at low altitude and everywhere the physical evidence of contoured graveled strand lines attests to the uplift of the land in recent centuries. This explains why all collections made along the coast must be at- tributed to modern or relatively recent Eskimos. A number of the projectile points and knives have blades of native copper, and in several cases of iron. Prelimi- nary inspection indicates that the greatest age among these coastal finds is represented in a series of harpoon heads, found on Cape Hearne, which are of Late Thule type. Sites discovered from 60 to 100 miles back in the interior, around Dismal Lake and Kamut Lake, show much greater antiquity. These were situated on eskers and raised beach lines, and contained 2 distinct com- plexes of chipped stone artifacts. One of these, the more common and widespread, consists of large, often coarse and undifferentiated forms of scrapers, and pro- jectile points or blades which resemble Yuma, Plainview, and Angostura types. The other is a microlithic com- plex which includes lamellar blades, some retouched, and minutely flaked end and side blades and scrapers. Two probable burins have been distinguished in this material. Analysis of these finds has not been completed, but it appears that the above mentioned complexes are entirely separate manifestations. Although no true Dor- set types are to be noted among the microlithic finds, it may be suggested that here is some slight evidence of a cultural development in the central Arctic which, still being oriented to inland subsistence patterns, repre- sented a stage intermediate between the Denbigh Flint complex of the west and the later Cape Dorset Eskimo culture of the eastern Arctic. YUKON TERRITORY. Richard S. MacNeish of the Na- tional Museum of Canda returned in 1955 for his second season of work in the Yukon Territory at the Firth River site near the Alaskan-Canadian border. This site un- doubtedly has tremendous potential importance for all archaeology in the eastern North American Arctic, for its stratigraphic sequence includes 9 cultures. It is in this area that the Brooks Range-Richardson Mountains system bulges northward and makes of the coastal plain a funnel that is only a few miles wide, and apparently most, if not all, of the early hunters who moved east- ward along the coastal fringe were forced to go through this passage. MacNeish, in his preliminary analysis, breaks down the 9-culture sequence as follows: the 3 latest levels are Eskimo, and the earliest of these con- tains Norton Check-stamped pottery. Earlier than these are 3 other pottery-bearing levels, containing Cord- marked, Dentate-stamped, and Grooved Paddle types, as well as microliths and burins. At the lowest levels are 3 nonpottery cultures, the latest of which is very much like the Cape Denbigh complex. Beneath this, the second culture has Plainview and Angostura points along with crude prismatic blades and crude burins, while the earliest stratum of the entire sequence holds a few coarse choppers and scrapers. The excavation of this site will be continued in the summer of 1956. SOUTHWEST ALASKA. Wendell Oswalt, reporting from Bethel, Alaska, has news of field work dating back to 1954. In June and July of that summer he operated in the Katmai National Monument, under the sponsorship of the National Park Service, and the results of his survey and excavation have their nearest parallels with de Laguna's Kachemak Bay III-IV materials. In August of that same year he worked in the middle Kuskokwim River country, doing both historic archaeology and eth- nography. The University of Alaska has a long range program of investigation in this region, and Oswalt is now conducting a community study at Napaskiak and will continue the site survey of the lower Kuskokwim, as well as making preliminary excavations at the early historic Russian settlement of Kolmakof this coming summer. The Assistant Editor for the Arctic hopes to establish contact with all Arctic enthusiasts in the near future, but there may be some whom he will miss for lack of a proper address. Please make life happier for him and earn his lasting gratitude by occasionally sending him an unsolicited report of northern activities. Assembled by ELMER HARP, JR. PACIFIC COAST AND GREAT BASIN BRITISH COLUMBIA. Charles Borden of the University of British Columbia reports that several archaeological projects are in the planning stage, including continued work at the Marpole site and a site survey in the Georgia Strait area. Borden is preparing the final reports on completed archaeological investigations in the coastal and interior areas of British Columbia. Wilson Duff of the Provincial Museum, Victoria, is working on a comprehensive study of stone sculpture of the Fraser Valley and Gulf of Georgia region. This subject holds considerable theoretical interest for the student of Northwest Coast and Plateau prehistory. WASHINGTON. University of Washington plans for another summer's salvage excavation in The Dalles reservoir are going ahead. In addition to other resources available for the work, endeavors are being made locally to enlist the aid of the Oregon Archaeological Society. OREGON. The University of Oregon conducted a sum- mer field session in archaeology on the northern Oregon coast as a stage in its program of Oregon coast pre- history. The coast has been completely surveyed and all sites have been evaluated. The program looks forwad 97</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY to systematic excavation in critical areas, moving over a period of years from north to south. Further work is planned east of The Dalles, Oregon, on the Oregon side of the Columbia River. The most important site re- maining is that at Big Eddy, which, until recently, was occupied by houses for the personnel at the Big Eddy offices of the Corps of Engineers. UTAH. The Great Basin Archaeological Conference will hold its 1956 meeting on the campus of the Uni- versity of Utah August 19-21. Details can be secured from Clement Meighan, Department of Anthropology and Sociology, University of California, Los Angeles 24, California. CALIFORNIA. The Region Four Office of the National Park Service reports that a small amount of money has been made available to extend their contract with the University of Southern California for the survey in Death Valley National Monument. Phil C. Orr of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History has received 2 radiocarbon dates for archae- ological sites on Santa Rosa Island. An age of 7070 + 250 years was received for a Dune Dweller cemetery, Red Head phase, and an age of 29,650 + 2500 years for charred mammoth bone from a "barbecue" pit. The Archaeological Survey Association of Southern California held its winter meetings at the Southwest Museum on January 28. The following officers were elected for this year: President, William J. Wallace; Field Leader, Freddie Curtis; Recording Secretary, Charles Rozaire; Secretary-Treasurer, Louella Grafton. A class in archaeological field methods from the University of Southern California has been conducting salvage excavations at a site in Redondo Beach. Previous work at the site in 1903 and 1923 resulted in the un- covering of a number of burials which were accom- panied by some of the richest and most unusual grave goods yet found on the southern California coast. Assembled by R. D. DAUGHERTY SOUTHWEST ARIZONA. The University of Arizona's archaeological field school opened its eleventh season at Point of Pines on June 15, with Raymond H. Thompson as Assistant Director. In addition to the excavations usually con- ducted in the late prehistoric sites of the region, atten- tion will focus on an alluvial site on Cienega Creek which was discovered last summer. This site produced a preceramic horizon with cremations, projectile points, and stone pipes, which represent a wholly new complex. Beneath the bed which produced the above evidence and in a stratigraphically older deposit there is material which typologically relates to the Chiricahua stage of the Cochise culture. In February the Arizona State Museum resumed work on the Lehner Ranch mammoth site near Hereford, Arizona, in the San Pedro Valley. While no new arti- facts were added to the inventory, a much clearer picture of the geology was obtained and the faunal as- semblage was expanded. The animals represented are mammoth, bison, tapir, and horse. Two distinct hearths, each producing good samples of charcoal for radiocarbon analysis, also occurred in the bone pit and make fairly certain the fact that some food preparation was done on the spot. The artifact count stands at 13 projectile points of Clovis type and 8 cutting and scraping tools, presumably used in the butchering of some of the ani- mals. The Amerind Foundation, Inc. is making an archae- ological survey of certain areas in the Gila and San Pedro valleys in search of ruins which might fulfill the needs of their next expedition which will study the period of the "Great House Builders" of southern Ari- zona. At the Museum of Northern Arizona there have been several staff changes during the course of the winter. David Breternitz has replaced Robert C. Euler as Cura- tor of Anthropology. In June Edward B. Danson will become the Assistant Director, replacing Malcolm Farmer who has resigned that position in order to continue work on his Ph.D. dissertation at the Uni- versity of Washington. The Museum of Northern Arizona hopes that as many archaeologists as possible will attend the Pecos Conference which will be held at the Research Center of the Museum on August 16, 17, and 18. For any additional details of the Pecos Conference write the Museum. Robert Euler is on leave of absence from the Depart- ment of Social Science, Arizona State College at Flag- staff, and is continuing his study of prehistoric and historic sites in the Walapai country. Euler, assisted by Paul Ezell and Henry Dobyns, excavated what appears to be a prehistoric-historic Walapai cave site and a historic Yavapai shelter in March of this year. These studies will form part of his doctoral disseration to be presented at the University of New Mexico. Sally Van Valkenburgh, of the National Park Service, has completed her survey of the north rim of Walnut Canyon and with Lee Able also surveyed Casa Grande National Monument. NEW MEXICO. The summer field school of the Uni- versity of New Mexico, under the direction of Florence Hawley Ellis, includes both ethnological and archaeologi- cal studies. Work is centered in the Rio Grande Pueblo area with concentration upon Basketmaker III archae- ology and studies of modern Pueblo material culture. The archaeology of New Mexico was aided by the spring winds that uncovered Folsom points, Atrisco points, "J" points, and others, both east and west of Albuquerque. The winds also revealed 2 more Basket- maker III sites, thus helping to refute the general opin- ion of 20 years ago that the Basketmaker did not in- habit the middle Rio Grande. Paul S. Martin and John Rinaldo, of the Chicago Na- tural History Museum, planned to return to the South- west in May. During the course of the winter the report on the excavations at the Foote Canyon site, the latest 98 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS Pueblo occupation in the Blue River Valley, has been written, and Martin is writing a "popular" account of the findings of their excavations in New Mexico over the past 17 years. COLORADO. At Mesa Verde last summer's excavation was in a small mesa-top pueblo dating from late Pueblo II or early Pueblo III times. The site was selected be- cause of the lack of surface evidence of a kiva. In- tensive testing proved that no kiva was present. The ruin contained 7 rooms and several small binlike en- closures and in plan is radically different from any ruin previously excavated. The survey of archaeological sites on Chapin Mesa, which was started 4 years ago, has been completed by Al Lancaster and various seasonal archaeologists. Chapin Mesa, the mesa on which park headquarters is located, is one of a score of long narrow mesas making up the Mesa Verde. In all, 956 sites were surveyed including: 191 cliff dwellings, 708 mesa-top ruins, 46 groups of farming terraces, 5 groups of pictographs, and 6 shrines. As the south end of Chapin Mesa is in the southern Ute Indian Reservation, it was not surveyed; a survey of this area might bring the total number of ruins on Chapin Mesa to over 1200. Robert H. Lister, of the University of Colorado, re- ports that he spent 5 weeks in Chihuahua and Durango, Mexico, during December and January continuing his study of cove sites in the northern Sierra Madre Occi- dental. The Division of Anthropology of the University of Colorado is offering 2 courses in archaeological research during the first term (June 15 to July 20) of the 1956 summer session. Robert H. Lister will direct under- graduate students who have had no previous field ex- perience in excavations at Mesa Verde National Park. Joe Ben Wheat will direct advanced students in Basket- maker and early Pueblo sites near Cortez, Colorado. Assembled by E. B. DANSON PLAINS As this is being written, in March, plans are afoot for a good deal of activity in the Plains area. As always, river basin salvage looms most important on the sched- ule. Federal funds for Missouri Basin salvage are slightly increased this year over last, and although these funds are still inadequate to do a reasonable sampling job, more activity is anticipated for 1956 than was possible in 1955. ALBERTA. H. M. Wormington of the Denver Museum of Natural History will continue the archaeological project begun in Alberta last year, under the auspices of the Glenbow Foundation. Several Early and Middle Prehistoric sites near Edmonton and Peace River are to be tested in June, July, and August, and it is expected that one or more of them will be dug intensively. E. Mott Davis will be participating, and several students will assist. NORTH DAKOTA-SOUTH DAKOTA. Most of the Missouri Basin salvage work in the Plains will be along the Mid- dle Missouri - the stretch of the Missouri River in North and South Dakota which is coming to be thought of as a separate archaeological area comparable to the Central Plains in culture-historical significance. In 1956 nearly all the work will be in the Oahe Reservoir area which extends from below Bismarck, North Dakota, about 250 miles downstream nearly to Pierre, South Dakota. There is a great number of large sites in this reservoir area, and it will not be possible to investigate a proper sample of them before flooding takes place. This circumstance makes the choice of sites to be dug a critical matter requiring the explicit formulation of key archaeological problems and the appraisal of sites in terms of their probable bearing on those problems. As of this writing, a number of field workers are still con- sidering the problem of which site to dig in 1956. The State Historical Society of North Dakota, cooper- ating with the National Park Service, will have a party in the field under Alan R. Woolworth and W. Ray- mond Wood from June 15 to September 1, with head- quarters in, of all places, the girls' dormitory of the Agency school at Fort Yates, North Dakota. They plan to dig earth lodges and cut strata trenches at 2 sites: the Demery site (39C01), a possible Arikara village straddling the North Dakota-South Dakota state line, and the Fireheart site (32SI2) which has an "Archaic Mandan" component. An intensive reconnaissance of this part of the Oahe area is also planned. Woolworth's report on the excavations at Grandmother's Lodge (32ME59) is expected to be published in North Dakota History in the near future. Near Mobridge, South Dakota, the W. H. Over Museum of the University of South Dakota, in collabor- ation with the South Dakota Archaeological Commission and the National Park Service, will dig at 3 village sites: Swan Creek (39WW7) which will have some final checking, Payne (39WW302), and site 39WW303. (This last site is called the Blacktail site in one piece of information received by the Assistant Editor, and the Whitetail site in another. We do not wish to take sides.) Both Payne and 39WW303 are believed to contain La Roche components. The field party will be led by Roscoe Wilmeth, who has recently joined the Museum staff as Curator of Anthropolgy. Waldo R. Wedel of the U.S. National Museum, assisted by George Metcalf, will conduct final excava- tions at the Cheyenne River site (39ST1) at the mouth of the Cheyenne River, and will then move a short distance north to the Black Widow site (39ST3) where he will follow up earlier investigations by Paul Cooper in 1952. In addition to Wedel's party, the River Basin Surveys expects to have 4, and perhaps 5, parties excavating sites in the Oahe Reservoir area from the middle of May until the end of September. Robert L. Stephenson plans to map and test the huge Fort Sully Indian site (39SL4) preparatory to conducting full-scale excavations in 1957. G. Hubert Smith will investigate a number of 19th 99</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY century historic sites. Richard P. Wheeler and Carl F. Miller, and possibly a third archaeologist, will lead parties digging at a number of sites yet to be selected. David A. Baerreis and a field party from the Univer- sity of Wisconsin, cooperating with the National Park Service, will also excavate a site in the Oahe Reservoir area. NEBRASKA. The Department of Anthropology of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln was host to the An- nual Meeting of the S.A.A., May 3-5. This is the first time the Society has met in the Plains area since the Norman meeting in 1950. The Nebraska State Historical Society, whose modern museum in Lincoln is growing in reputation for its outstanding displays on the Indian and white history of Nebraska, is opening another museum at Fort Robinson near Crawford in the northwestern corner of the state. Roger T. Grange, Jr., an anthropologist, is Curator of the new museum. Fort Robinson was the center of activities in the final Sioux and Cheyenne wars, and the displays will emphasize the history of the area since 1870, but a number of archaeological displays are in- cluded. Grange will be keeping an eye out for archae- ological sites in the vicinity. Marvin F. Kivett, Director of the Nebraska State Historical Society Museum, will lead an archaeological field party digging at the site of Fort Atkinson, just north of Omaha, for a 2-month period beginning in mid-June. This work is part of a historical and archae- ological project studying the important role played by Fort Atkinson in the history of both Indians and Whites in the Central and Northern Plains in the early 19th century. This fort was the earliest military post in the Central Plains, dating from 1819. It was established in order to open up the area for the fur trade, and was a center of early trading activity. It was the base for operations against the Arikara in 1823. The laboratory of the Missouri Basin Project, River Basin Surveys, in Lincoln, has undergone a face-lifting in anticipation of the activities on the Middle Missouri which have already been described. A stenographer, photographer, and part-time file clerk have been added to the staff, and laboratory activity is being stepped up. Robert L. Stephenson returned on January 10 to resume his duties as Chief of the Project, after an extended academic leave of absence. G. Hubert Smith has com- pleted a manuscript on the excavations at Fort Berthold II (39ML2), which is intended for publication in a BAE Bulletin as one of the River Basin Surveys Papers. WYOMING. David Gebhard of the Roswell, New Mex- ico, Museum will have a field party out for 6 weeks in southwestern and central Wyoming. They will look into a probable Fremont culture site near the Colorado- Wyoming state line, and a series of sites in the Big Horn Basin. KANSAS. At Kansas State College in Manhattan, Lin- wood L. Hodgdon reports that a small modern American Indian Museum has recently been opened in one wing of the College Library. The exhibits emphasize the Plains and include a model of an Upper Republican earth lodge, based on excavations near Manhattan in 1953. The Museum is attracting large numbers of vis- itors. Hodgdon has received a small research award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science to conduct limited archaeological investigations of earth lodges recently found in the vicinity of Man- hattan. TEXAS. Richard E. Johnson of Fort Worth reports that the Tarrant County Archeological Society was organized in October, 1955, and has 2 field projects under way: an archaeological survey of Tarrant County and a salvage program for a local area soon to be inun- dated. A series of lectures is being given on archae- ological techniques and on Texas archaeology. Assembled by E. MOTT DAVIS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ILLINOIS. John C. Mc.Gregor of the University of Illinois has been on sabbatical leave and has completed for the University Press the manuscript on the Pool and Irving sites, Illinois Hopewell. He was assisted by Elaine Bluhm of the Chicago Natural History Museum. The University of Illinois will sponsor an archae- ological field project on the Mississippi river near Hull this summer to learn more about earliest Hopewell and Black Sand relationships. This will be a student party with university credit. Jeremiah F. Epstein, Hunter Col- lege, New York, will be field supervisor. The Illinois State Museum is carrying on another season of field work at the Modoc Rock Shelter, June 11 to August 18, with 15 students under the direction of Melvin L. Fowler. Stuart Struever of Archeological Research Incorpo- rated excavated a Hopewell site in northern Illinois during the summer of 1955. The site covers the period from Middle Hopewell through late Woodland occupa- tions. On January 21 and 22 a group of archaeologists met at the invitation of John C. Mc.Gregor to discuss prob- lems of salvage and site surveys in Illinois, particularly in terms of incorporating the work with the impending highway construction program. The Illinois Archaeologi- cal Survey was formed for unifying and standardizing site surveys, with John C. Mc.Gregor president and Elaine Bluhm secretary. An informal conference, to meet in October of each year, was established to discuss and present current information on the archaeology of Il- linois and contiguous areas. Preston Holder of Washington University in St. Louis, received a grant from the American Philosophical Society for salvage archaeology at the Kunneman Mound in the Cahokia area. At Southern Illinois University analysis of the exca- vated material from the Cache River Valley is continu- ing, and the site survey program resulted in the location of over 50 new sites in the eastern part of the valley. All of these were Archaic, although 10 sites showed 100 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS slight traces of Woodland occupation. The Anthropol- ogy Club at Southern Illinois University is planning to do extensive testing of a large Woodland site near Crab Orchard Lake. INDIANA. The Indiana Historical Society sponsored the Indiana University Field School at Angel Mounds once more during the summer of 1955. Work was car- ried on in new areas, the most interesting of which was Mound A, the largest of the group. As a result of the excavations on the mound it is now known that the conical offset was erected on the top of the upper mound terrace and that it covered a burned structure of some sort, the exact nature of which is as yet un- known. Glenn A. Black has been granted leave until Feb- ruary, 1957, and therefore will not conduct a field school during the 1956 season. J. C. Householder and Downey Raibourn completed work at the McKinley Site, of Archaic affinity, near Noblesville, Indiana. James H. Kellar is gathering data on all known Stone Mounds and their content in the Ohio Valley. The resulting report will be published by the Indiana Histori- cal Society. IOWA. Reynold J. Ruppe of the State University re- ports that the Turin finds of last summer have created a great deal of interest in anthropology both on the cam- pus at Iowa City and throughout the state. A course on New World archaeology was presented for the first time. The material from the Mill Creek site is almost com- pletely analyzed and will be published shortly. An exhi- bition on Iowa archaeology has been installed in the library at the university. Seven students are majoring in archaeology and will participate under the direction of Ruppe in summer field work at the Mill Creek site sponsored by the State University of Iowa and the San- ford Museum of Cherokee. MINNESOTA. The Science Museum of St. Paul will complete this summer the third and final year of its archaeological excavations at Spring Lake, Dakota County. In addition to test excavations, 4 sites ranging from Middle Woodland to Upper Mississippi associa- tions have been excavated. The field party this summer is under the direction of Elden Johnson and will exca- vate 4 sites. The party will be supplemented by Louis H. Powell, who will interpret the well-developed Missis- sippi River terrace system in the area, and Philip Taylor, who will continue his zoological studies. Publication of the completed site reports and a report by Gilbert A. Leisman, Kansas State Teachers College, on the plant ecology of the area, is now in progress. A series of museum displays interpreting the finds at Spring Lake in terms of the broader prehistory of eastern North America is being completed. A meeting was held March 5 at the Historical Build- ing in Minneapolis. At that time an organization was set up to be known as the "Council for Emergency Archaeological Salvage" which will be administered by the Minneseota Historical Society with Russell Fridley of that institution as chairman. This council will con- sider such problems as a state wide archaeological sur- vey and emergency salvage. A University of Minnesota party of 4 students under the direction of Lloyd Wilford spent 3 weeks at the Bryan site on the Cannon River west of Red Wing. This site yielded a mixture of Silvernale, Cambria, and Oneota pottery types. Three small pit houses were found in 1954, none in 1955, although a number of pits and a quantity of sherds and artifacts were found. At Lake City, on the Mississippi 17 miles below Red Wing, 2 mounds were excavated. Though no artifacts accom- panied the burials found in them, they are tentatively ascribed to the Middle Woodland period. At the type site of the Great Oasis culture, which is situated on the bank of the extinct lake of that name, near the headwaters of the Des Moines River, 2 weeks were spent in searching unsuccessfully for burials. Three miles north of Henderson is a large group of mounds on a high point between the Minnesota River and High Island Creek. One of the largest mounds was excavated and found to have at its center a rectangular pit, shal- lowly dug into the subsoil, the long axis of which was east-west. The pit was filled with secondary burials in a very poor state of preservation. Above the pit was a covering of fair-sized logs, lying north-south. Near the top of the mound fill was an intrusive burial, a fully- extended primary burial, with which was associated a small mortuary pot, unquestionably Oneota. The mound is clearly pre-Oneota and is ascribed to the Southern Minnesota aspect, and to the Middle Woodland period. OHIO. The joint archaeological field session of the Ohio State Museum and the Ohio State University will again be in the Circleville area during the first term of the summer quarter. It is planned to excavate one of 2 small mounds just southeast of the Wolford Group excavated last summer. The work will be under the direction of Raymond S. Baby, assisted by R. M. Goslin and J. Schaeffer. MIssoURI. The tenth field session of the University of Missouri is being conducted near Ste. Genevieve, about 65 miles south of St. Louis. Besides excavation in a Woodland and a Mississippi village site, brief investi- gations will be made of Archaic and of historic French occupations of the area. Assembled by M. L. FOWLER SOUTHEAST FLORIDA. In October, the Florida State Museum spon- sored a series of tests in the Turner River site near Ever- glades City, Florida, with W. H. Sears in charge. This is one of the largest Glades area sites, containing over 30 oyster shell mounds averaging 20 feet in height spread in 2 rows along a quarter mile of Turner River. Tests indicate occupation in the late Glades I and the Glades II periods. 101</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In November and December, the Museum carried out a survey and testing program on a 500-acre tract near the mouth of the St. Johns River. Included in the tract are 6 distinguishable sites. W. H. Sears was in charge of the program, undertaken on a National Park Service contract. Shell midden deposits begin in the Deptford period, or earlier, and continue through to the historic level. One St. Johns Ib Weeden Island period burial mound was located and tested. The 8th annual meeting of the Florida Anthropologi- cal Society was held at Rainbow Springs on February 25. Over 80 members attending heard 19 papers delivered by members on various phases of Florida anthropology and history. The Florida State University, Department of Anthro- pology and Archaeology, has discovered a site near the mouth of the Aucilla River that appears to have been continuously occupied from the Archaic period to his- toric times. Sherds present include steatite, fiber tem- pered, Deptford, Swift Creek, and Fort Walton. Tre- mendous quantities of flint scrap indicate usage as a chipping station. There is a possibility of underwater preservation of organic materials. Other survey activities have included the Wakulla Beach section, where a site was located that is either a very late Weeden Island II or an atypical Weeden Island complex. Local collaborators report a burial in a cave near Marianna which yielded a circular copper gorget associ- ated with a shell gorget bearing incised dancing figures with speech scrolls, similar to one from the Yarnell site in eastern Tennessee. William C. Lazarus has excavated in a Fort Walton village site in Fort Walton beach. This is one of the many sites on the Florida northwest coast being de- stroyed by urban developments. Lazarus also collected 2 oblate spheroid "simple stamped" Poverty Point pot- tery objects from a site in Fort Walton beach. The Vero Man skull, longbones, and artifacts from the site, on loan from the Florida Geological Survey, are now on exhibit in the museum of the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology. Hale G. Smith and Charles H. Fairbanks investigated a report of the discovery of armor near Panama City. It proved to consist of an apparently complete brigan- dine made of overlapping iron plates fastened with copper rivets to a fabric. Probably made in Italy, it has been identified by Harold L. Peterson as dating from before 1535. It had been found in a blowout in a region of young shifting dunes on an open beach. A small fresh water stream is nearby, but there is little likelihood of any in situ remains. GEORGIA. Lewis H. Larson is analyzing materials from 2 seasons of excavation in Mound C at Etowah. A. R. Kelly is setting up a new laboratory at the Uni- versity of Georgia, moving collections made over the last 8 years. In February, Kelly visited fiber-temper period and later sites in the Ogeechee River drainage. John H. Cain, of Avera, Georgia, had made surface collections from 30 sites in the area. Several of these represent a Stallings Island occupation with fiber-temp- ered pottery in the top levels. This is particularly inter- esting since fiber-tempered sites disappear in north Georgia where the earliest ceramics are the fabric- marked Kellogg and Dunlap types. The new data may help to delimit the eastern frontier of the fabric im- pressed pottery. Kelly has also recently inspected new sites near Lumber City and Adel, which include ring- shaped earthworks, tentatively regarded as some sort of hut rings. Near Lumber City, at the source of the Alta- maha, Kelly visited a site reported by A. Y. Napier. Sand hillocks, one of which is probably a mound, occur on this rather extensive site on which are found, hori- zontally separated, Deptford, a late Swift Creek or Kolomoki Complicated Stamp, and cordmarked pottery. A similar site has recently been disclosed south of McRae in an extensive cut-and-fill operation made by the State Highway Department. During the fall and winter, the Department of Soci- ology and Anthropology at the University of Georgia worked on the mapping and photography of several newly discovered stone mound sites in north Georgia. These included 2 stone rings in Habersham County, a single large, but disturbed, mound in the Etowah Valley, and a group of 30 to 35 mounds north of Athens. VIRGINIA. An intensive field campaign lasting 15 con- tinuous months at Jamestown Island closed December 2, 1955. Headed by John L. Cotter, and employing at various times Edward B. Jelks, Joel L. Shiner, and Louis Caywood, the purpose of this field work was to complete all tests in the main habitation area of the first perma- nent English settlement before building and landscaping developments were undertaken for the 350th anniversary celebration scheduled for 1957. More than 6 miles of exploratory trenches supplemented the various area excavations and tests begun in 1934 and continued spor- adically through 1941 by J. C. Harrington, Carl F. Miller, H. C. Forman, A. W. Pond, J. T. Zaharov, H. S. Day, C. Benson and others. Results of the recent field work contributed materially to a comprehensive knowledge of land use and cultural remains at various periods of 17th century occupation by the settlers and by the pre-17th century Indians. Six major brick foundations were dis- covered including a large row house and 2 mansions of considerable importance. One hundred fifty other fea- tures were also recorded, including evidence of the first ironworking, iron making, pottery making, brickmaking, and gunsmithing by the English in the New World. Beside the kilns, hearths, shops, refuse pits, and numer- ous drainage and property line ditches, the earliest known ice storage pit in the New World was identified. Discoveries by Shiner and Caywood demonstrated the location of the earliest-known cemetery at Jamestown. Following intensive study of background data, previous excavations, and the artifacts and data from the recent field work, reports on various units of the Jamestown explorations will be written. With the collaboration of Museum Curator J. Paul Hudson, specialist in 17th century arts and crafts, who has been supervising the 102 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS laboratory preparation of Jamestown and Yorktown arti- facts, a popular study on the rediscovery of Jamestown will be produced for the 1957 celebration. Data and specimens will be employed in many exhibits now planned for the Jamestown museum (under construc- tion) and for numerous outdoor on-the-site exhibits which will interpret visually James Citty in the 1600's. Already constructed is an in-place exhibit housing a cross section of 3 Jamestown occupation zones in an earth profile through a Confederate earthwork of 1861. Below the earthwork lies a 17th century humus zone filled with artifacts, and below this, the only positively- aboriginal Indian village site on the island. The exhibit was developed from a test made last year by Joel Shiner. With some foundations left open, and others marked above ground, the First Settlement area will be fully interpreted to the public by 1957. Floyd Painter has excavated a colonial cellar on Lake George in Princess Anne County, under the auspices of the Norfolk Museum. Collections, dating 1620 to 1650, contain Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German, and English artifacts. TENNESSEE. Two minor investigations are under way within 80 miles of Knoxville. An attempt is being made to recover some information from a site on the Little Tennessee River to be inundated by an Aluminum Company dam now under construction. Bulldozer services have been made available by the company, and members of the Knoxville Chapter of the Tennessee Archaeological Society are working week ends under the supervision of T. M. N. Lewis and Madeline Kneberg. Of the 4 components present, Early Woodland, Early and Late Mississippi, and Cherokee, the last is yielding the greatest amount of data. It is the documented site of the Overhill Cherokee town of Tallassee, furthest up- stream of these settlements. The second site is a pure Early Woodland unit. This is another Society week end project carried out under the supervision of Kneberg and Lewis. It is the first pure Early Woodland unit known in the area, and the depth is sufficient to yield a developmental sequence if it exists. Radiocarbon dates are expected. The first Tennessee site to yield a concentration of Paleo-Indian fluted points and other artifacts has been located near Chattanooga, having been brought to light by seasonal fluctuations of Chickamauga Lake. The site has thus far yielded 14 Clovis forms and variants, and a considerable number of scraping and graving tools. KENTUCKY. Ellis Crawford reports that the Covington chapter of the Kentucky Archaeological Society is exca- vating village sites and a burial mound in the Big Bone Lick area. The burial mound was slabbed over with limestone rock. Burial furntiure included such Hope- wellian artifacts as cut and drilled deer and bear man- dibles and effigy platform pipes. The society is also expanding the archaeological survey of northern Ken- tucky. Assembled by W. H. SEARS MIDDLE AMERICA As this is written, most 1956 field operations are under way, and results are not yet available, but a few items missed in last issue's sumary of 1955 activities have come to our attention: MEXICO. George E. Fay, during June and July, 1955, visited 160 sites in the western coastal regions of Guer- rero, Colima, and Nayarit and in interior Michoacan, Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Sinaloa; 111 sites were sampled, and 5000 to 6000 sherds and other specimens were col- lected. Between Ciudad Colima and Tonila, Jalisco, 28 tumuli were recorded, and several of the accompanying village sites were sampled. Fay at present is undertaking a classification of pottery types for Nayarit. In Sonora he found 3 new sites of a complex which is thought to correspond to the San Pedro stage of the Arizona Co- chise, with the addition of cobble choppers similar to those occuring in southern California. Fay worked as research associate of the Instituo Interamericano with the help of a grant from the American Philosophical Society. He also made biological and soil sample collec- tions for other institutions. Southern Illinois University is sponsoring a field ses- sion in Durango again this summer, with J. Charles Kelley in charge. The Schroeder site will be further investigated, since many problems have arisen through analysis of the 1954 materials from the site. In addition, a program of surface surveying and minor testing is planned for various parts of Durango. Last December, Cezar Lizardi Ramos and Florence Miiller continued their digging in the vicinity of Tulan- cingo, Hidalgo. Three km. north of the town, at the site of Huapalcalco, they made excavations in an early sunken court floored with 14 layers of black clay. This they attribute to a horizon equivalent to Lower Ticoman. Adobe fagments suggest that the court or patio was surrounded by buildings and traces of painting were ob- served on the fragments and on the constructions. We have a brief note from Heinrich Berlin saying that in addition to his excavations in Preclassic sites in Chiapas he has made excavations in Postclassic mounds, uncovering a multichambered temple with plastered adobe walls. The activities of the Instituto Nacional de Antropo- logia e Historia have been largely concentrated on con- solidation of known structures, but the following dis- coveries unreported by us before deserve mention: At Tula, Hidalgo, 10 new bas-reliefs representing tlalocs and human figures were recovered in clearing Pyramid C. One bears a large hieroglyph associated with the number nine. Near the Palacio Quemado, a buried wall was followed down 3 m. to a plaster floor with post impres- sions. Faint traces of design on the mud plaster of the wall depict a deer with an arrow piercing its body. At Cholula, a structure attributed to a late Preclassic phase has been found under construction of Classic date. Three tombs with ceramic offerings, also from the end of the Preclassic period, were uncovered at Tlapacoya, and at Etzatlan, Jalisco, Corona Nufiez explored a burial 103</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY shaft described in a recent issue of the new series of field reports put out by the Instituo. This series should keep us abreast of the work being done in Mexico, and it is hoped that its publication will continue. In December, the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia held a 7-day session of discussions on Mesoamerican calendar systems. The question of the correlation of Aztec and Christian calendars, recently revived by the- ories proposed by Ola Apenas and Lizardi Ramos, was not resolved, and it is our impression that the breach between opinions on this and allied matters has not been perceptibly narrowed. The suggestion that a cal- endar still in use in Oaxaca, reported on by Robert Weitlander, might represent an archaic form added a new and interesting ingredient to the discussions. MAYA AREA. The work of consolidation and restora- tion of buildings in the Puuc sites of Yucatan was con- tinued under the direction of Alberto Ruz Lhuillier. A new group of ruins has been reported 2 km. east of Calkini at Pan-Kante near X-topon. A description of the site is not available, but judging by the mention of quantites of worked stone, it probably belongs to the Florescent period of the Puuc. Work at Palenque is somewhat delayed this year, but Robert Rands planned to go down in March to begin his work in connection with a study of Palenque pot- tery. E. Wyllys Andrews passed through Yucatan in Febru- ary on his way to the East Coast, where he planned to map and sample for pottery the site of Xcaret, north of Paamul. In the highlands, a newly discovered bas-relief found at Kaminaljuyui has attracted attention by its excellent workmanship and unusual style, related to that of the Classic Maya. It appears to have been a large altar broken in several pieces of which only 3 have been re- covered so far and represents an anthropomorphic figure with a hieroglyph combined with a bar and dot numeral. Assembled by TATIANA PROSKOURIAKOFF HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA Expeditions and Excavations. Alfred Kidder II, direc- tor of the University Museum expedition to Peru and Bolivia, has returned to the United States. During exca- vations in Tiahuanaco, Chipria, and Pucara he obtained several radiocarbon samples. He was joined for part of the expedition by Alan Sawyer of the Art Institute of Chicago. Donald Collier, heading the Chicago Museum of Natural History expedition to investigate the cultural sequence of the Casma valley, started work in this area. Larry Dawson of the University of California's fourth Peruvian expedition studied the Nazca collections at the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia y Antropologia in Lima and then made a survey of the sites and collections of the Nazca culture in the Ica-Nazca region. Dawson is investigating Nazca stylistic developments. The Centro de Estudios Antropologicos of the Uni- versity of Chile carried out excavations at the Los Hor- cones site north of Vifia del Mar, where previous reconnaissance indicated both long occupation and pos- sible relationships with the cultural sequence of the Elqui-Hurtado region. Carlos Munizaga of the Centro de Estudios Antropologicos and Jorge Iribarren of the Museo Arquelogico de La Serena carried out an inten- sive survey of the area between San Pedro de Atacama and Toconao, aided by the data gathered on a previous reconnaissance by R. P. Gustavo LaPaige, parish priest of San Pedro de Atacama. Their most interesting dis- coveries were (1) a site with many varieties of incised and punctate sherds; (2) a site with a large pressure- flaking industry and little evidence of ceramics; and (3) many instances of urn burial. These finds promise to fill in large gaps in the Chilean Atacamefio sequence and to interrelate it with adjacent Andean cultures. Conservation and Restoration. The Direcci6n de Arqueologia continued its clearing of the Castillo at Chavin de Huantar. Marino Gonzalez, who is in charge of the work, uncovered a new condor slab (85 by 35 cm.) and 2 stelae. The latter were reported to be found near the Tello "obelisk" in the Sunken Plaza (plaza sagrada according to the Tello plan). In addition to its supervision of the 2 urban develop- ments in Ancon and San Bartolo, the Direccion de Arqueologia is supervising the urbanization going on at Playa Grande with the help of Louis Stumer, who exca- vated there previously, and at the urbanization La Florida, near the Pampa de Amancaes, where Mejia Xesspe re- ported Chavin type pottery. Stumer, who previously reconnoitered the site, considers the pottery to be like the incised monochrome types at the recent Ancon cuts and probably somewhat post-Chavin. The site itself consists of 3 mounds. Arturo Jimenez Borja in collaboration with the Direc- ci6n de Arqueologia has almost completed restoration of the Inca-Rimac site of Puru-chuco, near Encalada. The rebuilt rooms are being decorated with textiles and pottery found in the nearby site of Huaquerones. This marks the second restoration of a coastal-Inca archi- tectural group. Tello restored part of the Inca section of Pachacamac previously. The other activities of the Direcci6n de Arqueologia e Historia were directed at preventing further encroachment on the famous ruins of Chan Chan and the Pampa of Nazca. The Direcci6n de Arqueologia e Historia has now been incorporated in the more comprehensive Direcci6n de Educaci6n Artistic, headed by Cesar Miro. Jorge Muelle, its last director, has been appointed director of the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia y Antropologia, succeeding Rebecca Carrion Cachot de Girard, who was recently married. Sporadic Discoveries. New painted wall panels in the Mochica site of Huaca de la Luna have been uncovered. They are being copied by Pedro Azabache, Peruvian mural painter, and should soon be published by the Museo Arqueologico of the University of Trujillo. [ XXII, 1, 1956 104</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND NEWS Deformed crania of the Colonial period were found in ossuaries of the Santo Domino convent, indicating continuance of the practice of deformation into the Colonial period. A commission for excavation from the Museo Regional de Ayacucho, headed by Jos6 Casafranca, discovered a shrine with remains of what he calls Chavin type ce- ramics in the Pampas de Chupas, 20 km. south of Ayacucho. An amateur expedition explored the little known altiplano of far northern Chile. Two sites are reported so far: Chapicollo, a ruin with circular structures, and Guaycuta where small stone "houses" were found in association with red-white-black ceramics. The archi- tecture is of highland type, and the ceramics seem to point to an extension of Arica II influence into the interior. Assembled by RICHARD P. SCHAEDEL LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. During the latter part of 1955, Vilma Chiara and Harald Schultz of the Museu Paulista made surface collections from an archaeological site occupied by the present town of Itacoatiara, on the north bank of the Amazon below Manaos, and from a second site some 2 km. outside the same town. These represent different ceramic complexes. The outlying site produced material comparable to that collected by the same investigators from Manacapuru, farther up the river, affording some indication of the territorial distribution of this rather elaborate pottery style. URUGUAY. The first issue of a mimeographed publica- tion, Boletin de la Sociedad de Antropologia del Uru- guay, is dated July-December 1955. This society was organized under its present name in 1951. Among its goals are the undertaking of original research, promoting the teaching of anthropology, assisting in the publication of anthropological monographs, and expediting the ex- change of information, bibliography, and publications with foreign associations. One of the projects undertaken by this society is the "location and description of the principal aboriginal archaeological sites in the country." The purpose of the Boletin, which is scheduled to ap- pear twice yearly, is to familiarize anthropologists in other parts of the world with the progress of anthropo- logical investigations in Uruguay. On behalf of one "foreign" society, we should like to express our appreci- ation and congratulations. Assembled by BETTY J. MEGGERS EARLY MAN CALIFORNIA. Santa Rosa Island, the central member of 3 large islands off the Santa Barbara coast in southern California, has been the scene of intensive excavation and study by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History since 1947. Phil C. Orr of the museum staff has been in charge of this work. Late Pleistocene sedi- ments are exposed in seacliffs 75 feet high along the northwestern coast of Santa Rosa Island and contain abundant remains of a dwarf mammoth (see Chester Stock and E. L. Furlong in Science, Vol. 68, pp. 140-1, 1928). In many areas where remains of the dwarf mammoth are found, the clay is burned a brick red with flecks of charcoal throughout. Such fire areas are scattered through the entire depth of these beds between Arling- ton and Tecolote canyons, but are not found in other, nearby exposures. The Santa Barbara Museum of Natu- ral History has excavated hundreds of bones of the dwarf mammoth but only rarely are they articulated. Skulls usually lack the cranium and vertebrae and ribs are often broken, burned, or missing. On the other hand, pelves, jaws, tusks, and long bones are usually intact. These facts alone suggest that man killed the mammoths, selecting certain parts for food while re- jecting others (compare with observations made by Luis Aveleyra A. de Anda on the second mammoth at Santa Isabel Iztapan, in this issue). Four localities are known in which a large portion of the mammoth skeleton was present in a burned area. The skull was absent in all of them. In one, a chipped stone was weathered from the soil. At Survey Point a large portion of a mammoth skeleton was excavated in 1948 by R. S. Finley and Phil C. Orr. This specimen was exposed exactly midway in a seacliff 74 feet high, the bones lying on a slope of burned clay containing charcoal flecks, apparently in a hole or pit originally. In September, 1955, with the cooperation of the Western Speleological Institute and the Scripps Insti- tute of Oceanography, the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History was able to invite Carl L. Hubbs of Scripps, George F. Carter of Johns Hopkins University, and Wallace Broecker of the Lamont Geological Observ- atory, Columbia University, to visit Santa Rosa Island. Broecker collected samples of burned mammoth bone at the Survey Point locality, on which the Lamont radio- carbon laboratory made 4 age determinations, averaging 29,650 + 2500 years. In Tecolote Canyon, a half mile west of the locality from which the above radiocarbon dates were obtained, 2 skulls of the dwarf mammoth were found, both with the cranium destroyed. One was too badly broken to be collected, although the limb bones were well pre- served. Natural conditions do not fully explain why so many crania are crushed or missing, but it is suggested that they were deliberately destroyed to extract the brains for food (compare this point, too, with that men- tioned by Aveleyra). Comparable conditions are found in more recent Indian sites in this area where thousands of skulls and jaws of sea lion and otter are found, the crania invariably damaged for extraction of the brains. From 5 to 10 feet below the stratum containing the 2 skulls mentioned above, burned cypress stumps were dated by the Lamont laboratory at 17,000 + 450 and 16,300 + 500 years, an average of 16,650 + 450 years. The latter dates, subtracted from the average of 29,650 ? 2500 years for the 4 determinations at Survey Point, 105</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY indicate at least 13,000 years for the contemporaneity of man and dwarf mammoth on Santa Rosa Island. It is not yet known, of course, how much earlier this associ- ation may have begun, or when the island mammoth became extinct. As this peculiar mammoth was only 4 to 6 feet high, it probably was not very difficult to kill. Scattered through the mammoth-bearing beds are occasional abalone shells, one of which was found 3 miles in from the present coast. As no animals are known on these islands which could carry heavy abalone shells this distance, one must admit the probability that man was responsible. In the top 10 feet of Pleistocene deposits west of Tecolote Canyon, there are numerous chips of low-grade chert, again indicating the presence of man. Burned mammoth remains are only a few yards away and slightly lower than this deposit. Although lightning is virtually unknown in this area today, the possibility that lightning fires may have burned the mammoth bones and soil in the past must be con- sidered. However, it is difficult to see how natural fires could account for the concentration and depth of the burned soil, or how anything but human agency could account for the dismemberment of the skeletons and removal of certain parts of them in such a consistent manner. At the top of the seacliff east of Arlington Canyon, a well-defined midden occurs under 12 feet of alluvium. The Lamont laboratory has made radiocarbon determina- tions of 6850 + 200 and 6750 + 100 years on this midden for an average of 6800 + 150 years. This de- posit has all of the characteristics of Pleistocene deposits and lies conformably on them, but the date seems low. The 3 large islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz lie 30 miles and more off the Santa Barbara coast, while east of them tiny East Anacapa Island is 12 miles from the mainland. As to how man may have reached Santa Rosa Island some 30,000 years ago, Orr offers the following data: The present maximum sea depth between these islands is about 120 feet, so that during a glacial stage, a sea lower by this amount would have permitted man to walk dry-shod between the present islands. On the other hand, the maximum depth between East Anacapa Island and the mainland is now 706 feet, much too great for a land bridge during any of the late Pleistocene glacial stages. However, with the sea some 300 feet lower than the present, the open- water channel would have been about 400 feet deep but only about 2 miles wide -or less if the sea was lowered by more than 300 feet. Orr believes that such a channel would not have been too difficult to cross by raft or even by strong swimmers. Numerous small mammals did reach the islands over a land connection but this may have long preceded the time of man. NEVADA. In cooperation with the Nevada State Mu- seum, the Western Speleological Institute, directed by Phil C. Orr, has continued the excavation and study of Early Man material from Fishbone Cave in Nevada. Four distinct levels are recognized in this cave, repre- senting 4 climatic stages. In the 2 lower levels, 3 and 4, human habitation is associated with split and burned bones of extinct horse and camel. Wallace Broecker of the Lamont laboratory has obtained a radiocarbon date of 11,227 ? 400 years on the lowest level, "'the oldest radiocarbon date for perishable material and human skeletal material in America." Bulletin 2 of the Nevada State Museum has been prepared on Fishbone Cave and only awaits further radiocarbon dates before going to press. Surveys and excavations in other Nevada caves are being conducted by the Western Speleological Insti- tute in cooperation with the Nevada State Museum. TEXAS. In February, 1956, members of the Dallas Archeological Society, led by R. K. Harris and Wilson W. Crook, Jr., discovered a series of hearths in the Upper Shuler formation near Lewisville in Denton County. The Upper and Lower Shuler formations have long been recognized as late Pleistocene from their fossil associations and probably correlate with the late and early Wisconsin glacial stages, respectively. It is of great interest that these hearths, consisting of burned earth and charcoal, as well as burned animal bone, are found in more or less circular, basin-shaped pits up to 18 inches or more in depth and from about 4 to 10 feet in diameter. In addition to 3 large hearths, 7 smaller ones have been found at various levels in the Upper Shuler formation. They were witnessed on March 4 by A. D. Krieger, before being explored by excavation. Later, on the systematic dissection of the largest hearth, a fine Clovis fluted point was found in situ within it, and only 20 inches away, and well within the hearth, was found a charred branch some 4 inches in diameter and 7 inches long, a perfect specimen for radiocarbon dating. Charred bone from the same hearth will be useful for other datings. These dates, when available, should provide a fine check on the general suspicion that Clovis points are older than Folsom in the Great Plains region, for Clovis points have not so far been accurately dated. When the Dallas Archeological Societay had exca- vated 275 feet of ground around the largest hearth, a second hearth pit at a slightly lower level, and a small area of fired earth nearby, no artifacts in addition to the Clovis point had been found. However, highly signifi- cant information on the food habits of the makers of Clovis points, heretofore unknown, was obtained. Re- mains were found of 2 tortoises, a large bison, a large wolf (?), rabbits, split bones suggestive of small deer or antelope, birds, 3 small mussel shells, and a snail shell, all burned and in situ in the hearth pits. A few years ago, Theodore E. White, paleontologist for the Smith- sonian Institution's River Basin Surveys, recovered fos- sils from the immediate vicinity of the hearths and on the same erosional surface. These included a large camel skull, Bison taylori, coyote jaw, an antler base and skull fragment suggestive of mule deer, a lower jaw and articulated hind leg of a young antelope (?), a prairie dog jaw, and numerous fragments of turtle cara- pace. Recently a mammoth (?) leg bone was found weathering from the same formation some 75 yards 106 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND NEWS from the excavated hearth pits. This faunal assemblage shows that the makers of Clovis points in this vicinity not only hunted the large, now-extinct Pleistocene mam- mals, but utilized all sorts of small mammals, many of which survived in the area until the present, and ap- parently even ate mussels and snails - perhaps even snakes. A field party from Southern Methodist Univer- sity recently recovered the delicate fossil of a grass-snake skeleton at the same locality. E. H. Sellards reports that the radiocarbon age deter- mination of 9883 + 350 years on the Folsom culture horizon at Lubbock, Texas, made by Libby in 1950, has been confirmed by a second test. The original test was made on burned bison bone collected by Glen L. Evans and Grayson Meade in September, 1950, from the basal 3 inches of the Folsom stratum. The second test was made on fresh-water snail shells collected in December, 1952, by Evans and Meade, representing on the average the central (or somewhat below the central) part of the Folsom stratum. The snail shells were kept in storage at the Texas Memorial Museum until October, 1955, when they were submitted to the Lamont laboratory. In De- cember, 1955, an age of 9300 + 200 years was obtained on this sample. According to Sellards, the age difference between the 2 samples, some 583 years, "is not unex- pected considering the difference in stratigraphic posi- tion of the two samples." MEXICO. Luis Aveleyra A. de Anda, Director of the Direcci6n de Prehistoria, Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia, Mexico, reported in March that by a miraculous stroke of luck he rediscovered the famed "carved sacrum of Tequixquiac" in the collection of an old man in Guadalajara. This sacrum of an extinct llama, carved into the semblance of a coyote or wolf face, was described by Barcena in 1882 but was then lost at about the close of the century. Aveleyra reports that, "There is not the slightest doubt about the identity of the piece, nor its value as a human artifact. ... If I am not mistaken, the fossil sacrum remains the only example of Pleistocene art from the whole continent, with the probable exception of the stone heads from Malakoff, Texas, and the notched bone disks from Lindenmeier, Colorado." He plans to publish a paper on it, with new illustrations and descriptions and docu- menting its long and hazardous career. PATAGONIA. Professor Oswaldo Menghin, Museo Etno- grafico de Argentina, Buenos Aires, reports that he has completed his sixth expedition to Patagonia. Referring to the article on Tule Springs, Nevada, in Natural His- tory for February, 1956, he states that he is much im- pressed by the similarity between the artifacts shown from Tule Springs and material from the "Mylodon" Cave in Chile and the second level of Junius Bird's excavation in the Magallanes Caves, "which contains, characteristically, many objects of bone as well as stone." Although radiocarbon dates would indicate that Tule Springs (more than 23,800 years) was much older than the Patagonian and Chilean sites mentioned, Menghin advances the hypothesis that they belong to a similar cultural base which he would term "Protolithic." A greater age in North America would naturally be ex- pected if such a culture actually diffused this enormous distance. Assembled by ALEX D. KRIEGER 107</page></plain_text>
