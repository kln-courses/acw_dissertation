Hansen Analysis Group, Inc. Washington, DC John A. Hinch ENSCO, Inc. Springfield, VA ABSTRACT This paper describes the results of recent research conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on occupant injury due to single vehicle side impacts into .roadside objects. Injuries and fatalities due to side impacts on our nation's highways are discussed, followed by a review of historic testing conducted by FHWA. Results from current research are then presented and conclusions stated. Recommendations are provided with regard to the strengthening and/or provision for energy absorption for vehicle sides, and with regard to test and evaluation criteria for future side impact research. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, the number of highway fatalities has dropped from approximately 55,000 to less than 45,000 per year and the fatality rate has dropped from 4.4 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles to 2.5. Still, accidents directly related to vehicle and highway design continue to take their toll. Each year, approximately 12,000 people are killed in ran- off-the-road single vehicle pollisions with fixed roadside objects and roadside features - the roadside safety problem. Specifically, as shown in Table 1, data from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), a national database containing information on all fatal accidents occurring within a specific year, indicate that for the years 1984 through 1986, 11,859, 11,599 and 12,654 roadside fatalities occurred, respectively. Of these annual roadside fatalities, roughly 60 percent are collisions with the front of the impacting vehicle and in excess of 20 percent are collisions with both sides. Overturning vehicles are included in each percentage. Single vehicle fatal collisions into the side of the impacting vehicle are delineated in able 2 (taken from the FARS database) by most Table 1 - Occupant Fatalities, 1984-86 (Single Vehicles with Fixed Roadside Objects and Features) Vehicle 1984 1985 1986 Location No. % No. % No. % Front 6953 58.6 6985 60.2 7334 58.0 Side 2593 21.9 2585 22.3 2826 22.3 Rear 210 1.8 239 2.1 296 2.3 Other 2103 17.7 1790 15.4 2198 17.4 Total 11,859 100.0 11,599 100.0 12,654 100.0 significant roadside object or feature struck. For the years 1984 through 1986, side impact roadside collisions accounted for 2,593 (21.9 percent of the annual roadside total), 2,585 (22.3 percent) and 2,826 (22.3 percent) fatalities respectively. Of these, roughly 60 percent are due to impacts with three types of roadside objects: trees, utility poles, and other poles and signs (which include highway sign posts, overhead sign supports, luminaire supports and other poles and posts). Thus, from a roadside safety perspective, collisions resulting from vehicles which are out of control and are impacting sideways in some manner into narrow roadside objects such as trees and poles are a significant safety problem. This paper describes and summarizes recent FHWA research involving mini-size cars impacting sideways into breakaway luminaire supports and other pole like objects. It focuses on the latest series of eight tests recently completed at the Federal Outdoor Impact Laboratory (FOIL), a research and learning center located on the grounds of^FHWA's R&amp;D complex in McLean, Virginia.

Determination of the types of occupant injury occurring during such collisions and injury causation mechanisms were principal objectives. The development of preliminary test evaluation criteria linking injury potential to vehicle rather than dummy results was another important objective. REVIEW OF PRIOR RESEARCH Side impact research is currently being pursued by both FHWA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). NHTSA research primarily focuses on vehicle to vehicle collisions, whereas FHWA research focuses on vehicle collisions with fixed roadside objects and roadside features. To date, FHWA side impact research has focused on breakaway luminaire supports and other narrow fixed objects. The following discussion provides a review of past FHWA research related to side impact collisions. The discussion also includes four tests funded by NHTSA into a pole like object. EARLY TESTS - Some early tests into a rigid instrumented pole were sponsored by NHTSA and conducted during the late 1984 time frame. [2 - 6] Four tests were conducted involving Volkswagen Rabbits weighing approximately 2600 lb (including dummies and cargo), "crabbed" at an angle of 45 degrees and impacting at speeds of 20 and 25 mi/h. These tests focused on intrusion during side impact and on possible vehicle structural and interior design changes to minimize occupant injury. Appurtenance design improvements to minimize injury were not considered. Several impact tests have been conducted under FHWA sponsored research programs in the past. In one early test, conducted in 1976, a 1971 Chevrolet Vega weighing 2670 lb (no dummy involved, includes weight of side impact casters) impacted broadside into a breakaway slipbase luminaire support at 22 mi/h. [7,8] To perform this test, a set of large casters was fitted to the outboard portion of the vehicle and actually carried the vehicle. Just prior to impact, the casters were raised, allowing the vehicle to skid into the luminaire support. This concept worked well, but the casters made up a large portion of the vehicle test weight (approximately 400 lb) due to the size of the wheels and their activation hardware. Two additional early side impact tests were conducted in 1982, one impacting broadside at the occupant shoulder location and one impacting at 45 degrees aligned with the vehicle A-pi 11 ar. [9] These tests were conducted to determine, in a preliminary manner, the magnitude of the side impact problem when narrow pole like objects were involved in roadside collisions. The tests used Volkswagen Rabbits weighing 1850 lb (exclusive of the side impact dummy) as test vehicles and a heavy (1,000 lb) breakaway slipbase "surrogate" pole as the test article. In the broadside test, the vehicle impacted the pole at a point aligned with the instrumented dummy at 30.4 mi/h. The vehicle broke the pole away but the dummy incurred a severe to fatal injury due to head and thoracic trauma. The second test involved the use of a similar vehicle impacting the pole at 45 degrees and 30 mi/h. This test resulted in fairly minor impact severities with low predictors of injury. PRELIMINARY FOIL TESTS - Following completion (in 1985) of the side impact test capability at the FOIL research and learning center, a series of eight full-scale tests was conducted to determine side crush characteristics of four different vehicles, as- well as their safety performance during side impact collisions with slipbase luminaire supports. [9] Three of the vehicles configured for testing weighed 1850 lb (exclusive of the side impact dummy), while the fourth, a Dodge St. Regis, weighed 4500 lb. A list of the tests conducted and the vehicles used is presented in Table 3. Rigid Pole Tests - The four rigid pole tests involved impacting the vehicles broadside into a rigid instrumented pole at a point on the vehicle near the occupant shoulder. The impact forces were measured with the instrumented rigid pole. Additionally, vehicle responses were measured with accelerometers and rate gyros located at the vehicle center of gravity. The instrumented pole collected data for the local forces acting on the sill structure, door, 459</page><page sequence="3">Table 3 - Tests Conducted During FOIL Development Test Number Vehicle Structure Speed 1469-SI - 1 -85 Honda Civic Rigid Pole 25 mi/h 1469-SI-2-85 VW Rabbit Rigid Pole 25 mi/h 1469-SI-3-85 Dodge Colt Rigid Pole 25 mi/h 1469-SI -4-85 Honda Civic Lum Support 30 mi/h 1469-SI -5-85 VW Rabbit Lum Support 30 mi/h 1469-SI -6-85 Dodge Colt Lum Support 30 mi/h 1469-SI-7-85 Dodge St Regis Lum Support 30 mi/h 1469-SI -8-85 Dodge St Regis Rigid Pole 10 mi/h and the roof. These forces were summed and the total force acting on the vehicle was determined. Figure 1 presents the force-displacement characteristics for all four vehicles. Test SI#8 was conducted with a full sized vehicle with unknown stiffness. To prevent possible damage to the instrumented rigid pole, this test was conducted at a much lower speed. Deflection data for all vehicles were determined from high speed film because the lateral accelerometer data (from vehicle center of gravity) was biased due to contamination from vehicle yaw motion. As depicted in Figure 1, the side stiffness of the lighter weight vehicles when tested at 25 mi/h is somewhat similar regarding both peak force (15,300 to 17,800 lb) and maximum dynamic deflection (23.7 to 29.8 in). 4 ' e- I81*8 |SI#1 X ř 81 'v' I ' ¿ i»- !

This device was selected for testing because it was known to be one of the safer breakaway devices currently installed on our nation's roadways. Previous tests produced vehicle velocity changes ranging from a low of approximately 8 ft /s to a high approaching 12 ft/s when tested under controlled frontal impact conditions at speeds of 60 and 20 mi/h respectively. In all cases, the luminaire support broke away. However, for the lighter weight cars, prior to actuation of the support and rotation out of the path of the oncoming car, significant occupant compartment intrusion occurred with the result that severe head and thorax trauma occurred. Table 4 provides details of some of the major observations from these tests.

All tests were conducted with the vehicle aligned broadside with the line of travel, impacting at a speed of 30 mi/h. These test conditions, as well as the selection of a lightweight mini -size vehicle were chosen based upon a preliminary review of several accident databases and a desire to select test conditions which lie somewhere between the median and the worst case regarding severity. [10] Two different types of luminaire supports commonly used on our nation's roadways were impacted, slipbase and transformer base supports. These supports are depicted in Figures 2 and 3.

Basically, a dual rail guidance and delivery system is employed during side impact testing with the majority of the vehicle weight supported by the main rail and the remainder supported by an auxiliary outrigger rail. Just prior to impact the dual rail system terminates with the result that the vehicle (as it approaches the test article) travels off the end of the rail system, lands on the ground and 460</page><page sequence="4">skids sideways on its tires until impact. This vehicle delivery system is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 2 - Slipbase Luminaire Support Figure 3 - Transformer Base Luminaire Support Vehicle acceleration is supplied using the FOIL'S drop weight propulsion system. [1] Various impact locations on the vehicle are obtained by moving the luminaire support laterally across the test runway. TEST VEHICLES - The test vehicles were 1980 and 1981 Plymouth Champs and Dodge Colts. The test inertial weight (vehicle without dummy) for the vehicle and the gross static weight (including the dummy) along with the year, make and model are presented in Table 6. The longitudinal center of gravity of each vehicle without the occupant was located approximately 32 inches behind the centerline of the front axle. The location of the center of gravity (X, Y &amp; Z) and the principal moments of inertia (roll, pitch &amp; yaw) for each test vehicle in its as-delivered and as-tested configurations are given in Table 7. These inertial data were obtained using the FOIL'S Inertial Measuring Device ( IMD) .

One rate gyro was also installed to the same mounting block to measure yaw rate. The data from these accel erometers were used to measure vehicle impact behavior and to assess occupant injury severity. (The latter is based upon a theoretical unrestrained occupant moving laterally in the occupant compartment following an impact with a fixed object and, subsequently, experiencing velocity changes and accelerations upon impact with the interior of the car. [11]) The test vehicles were also equipped with a contact switch mounted on the left door to permit vehicle and dummy data to be measured relative to the instant of impact. A typical test vehicle is shown in Figure 5, and a list of vehicle instrumentation is provided in Table 8. 461</page><page sequence="5">Table 7 - Vehicle Inertial Data Test No. SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 Inertial Data.

This Side Impact Dummy (SID), developed under prior NHTSA sponsored research, has been • fitted with a special thorax which uses thoracic and pelvic accelerometers to measure side loads. [12] The SID was positioned in the driver's seat during each test and was unrestrained except for a light string which kept the dummy from sliding over during the vehicle acceleration phase. The dummy was equipped with a set of up to 18 acceler- ometers, as listed in Table 9.

[13] Additionally, the data obtained from the accelerometers located at the lower spine and the upper and lower ribs were used to determine thorax trauma and the probability of severe and fatal injury based upon such trauma using the Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI-86) . [14, 15, 16] 462</page><page sequence="6">The data obtained from the triaxial accelerometer assemblies located in the upper and lower parts of the spine and in the pelvis of the test dummy were used to determine severity indices and the maximum resultant sustained accelerations experienced by the occupant at the respective locations. These two items were calculated in accordance with the methods specified in SAE Information Report J885a and in FMVSS No. 208 respectively. [17, 13] These data were derived for informational purposes only as an additional gauge of the relative severity of the impacts. It was not used for subsequent occupant injury predictions. TEST DEVICES - The two types of breakaway luminaire supports used during this test series (slipbase and transformer base) were selected because they are typical of the range of safety performance currently available on our nation's roadways. The slipbase luminaire support was identical to that used in the earlier series of side impact tests conducted at the FOIL and was selected because it is known to be one of the safer breakaway luminaire supports currently in use (that is, produces low values of vehicle velocity change when impacted in a frontal manner). The transformer base support, on the other hand, is more typical of the average currently in use. (One objective of this research was to determine what levels and what types of injuries could be expected during a side impact collision with one of the better performing breakaway devices - the slipbase - currently in use on our road system.) The dimensions and properties of the two types of luminaire supports tested are listed in Table 10. The slipbase luminaire supports incorporated a triangular 3-bolt slipbase which is based on a design similar to the California Type 31 support. Each slipbase support was positioned so that impact would occur perpendicular to an edge which had two bolts aligned. The slipbase was clamped together with three bolts which were each tightened to 14 kips for tests 1, 3 through 6, and 7, and finger tight for test 8. For test 2, the only test which utilized a transformer base, the base was clamped to the foundation with four studs which were each tightened to 200 ft-lbs of torque. Additionally, each luminaire support had a mast arm attached, as well as a steel weight attached to the end of the arm, simulating the luminaire. DATA ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY - Data from all transducers (both vehicle and dummy) were recorded on analog tape and subsequently digitized after completion of each test. Digitization was accomplished using a sampling rate of 8,000 samples/sec in conjunction with an SAE Class 1,000 low pass filter (linear one-to- one output up to 1,000 Hz, with a cutoff frequency of 1,650 Hz). The resultant digitized data were stored on digital data tape for subsequent processing. Film documentation of each test, obtained from multiple high speed cameras operating at minimum filming rates of 500 frames/sec, was Table 10 - Properties of Test Base and Pole Type SI jpbase Transformer Base Manufacturer Ameron Union Metal Material Steel Steel Weight 416 lbs 386 lbs Height, e.g. 21 ft 23 ft-10 in Top diameter 3-1/2 in 6 in Bottom diameter 7.5 in 8 in Mast Arm Length 15 ft - 9 in 14 ft - 9 in Luminaire Hght 35 ft - 10 in 39 ft Luminaire Wght 51 lbs 51 lbs Base Type Calif.

Subsequently, this documentation was developed, edited, combined into a single film record and copied for further data processing. Vehicle Data Analysis Methodology - Analysis of vehicle data can be separated into three distinct categories: Vehicle Velocity Calculations (impact, velocity change and exit), Occupant Impact Velocity &amp; Acceleration Determinations ("Flail Space" velocity change and "Ridedown" acceleration) and Static Crush Measurements. Vehicle Velocity Calculations - To determine the impact velocity of the test vehicle, redundant high speed cameras (filming at a constant rate of 500 frames/sec minimum) located perpendicular to the vehicle's motion were employed. A series of frames from each film record immediately prior to impact were analyzed, frame by frame, using a film motion analyzer •coupled with an IBM PC-AT computer to determine the displacements of the vehicle and the associated time intervals. Subsequently, a linear regression analysis was performed on the resulting displacement-time data to determine the line which best fit the data. The impact velocity was determined from the slope of this line. Because redundant cameras were used to measure the displacement of the vehicle immediately prior to impact, the velocity calculated from two cameras were averaged to establish the reported impact velocity. To determine the vehicle's velocity change during the impact event, the data obtained from the accelerometers located at the vehicle center of gravity (X, Y &amp; Z) were again filtered using an SAE Class 180 low pass filter (one-to-one output up to 180 Hz with a cutoff frequency of 300 Hz). The resulting digitized acceleration data in the lateral direction (Y) were subsequently processed (by performing a simple integration) to determine the area under the 463</page><page sequence="7">acceleration curve (that is, the velocity change) between impact and loss of contact with the support. To compute the exit velocity of the test vehicle after breakaway of the support and subsequent loss of contact, the velocity change of the vehicle (calculated from Y acceleration data) was subtracted from the impact velocity (determined from film analysis). Occupant Impact Velocity &amp; Acceleration Determinations - To determine the lateral impact velocity of a theoretical unrestrained occupant against the occupant compartment interior ("Flail Space" velocity change) and the occupant's subsequent acceleration while in contact with the interior surface following the impact ("Ridedown" acceleration), the resulting lateral acceleration data (Y direction) after filtering with the SAE Class 180 low pass filter was again used. These two quantities were determined in accordance with the procedures outlined in NCHRP Report No. 230. [11] As specified in Report No. 230, a one foot flail distance (between the occupant and the interior door surface) was used even though the actual distance in the test vehicles was somewhat less. Static Crush Measurements - The vehicle static crush was measured using the NHTSA specified 6-point measurement technique. [18] As prescribed by this technique, a set of L, C and D values were determined from each tested vehicle along with the maximum resultant (static) crush. As depicted in Figure 6, the L value indicates the overall length of the damage. The D value gives the distance from the vehicle center of gravity to the center of damage, with minus data indicating the damage is rearward of the center of gravity. The C values define the actual deformation as measured at six equally spaced places along the damaged area, with CI being the rear most and C6 the front most. Since the C values do not always indicate the maximum crush, particularly when narrow roadside objects are involved, maximum static crush was also measured. X © _ &gt; C1 C6 k- ~&gt;l ■»!

Head Injury Criteria (HIC) Calculations - The digitized data obtained from the three accelerometers located in the head of the occupant were combined to yield a resultant acceleration occurring during the impact event. The Head Injury Criteria (HIC) were determined in accordance with the procedures outlined in FMVSS 208. [13] Thoracic Injury Determinations - The digitized data obtained from the lateral accelerometers (Y direction) mounted at the upper spine (T01Y), the lower spine (T12Y), the left upper rib ( LURY) and the left lower rib (LLRY) locations within the thorax of the SID were again filtered, this time using the NHTSA developed Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. [15] The Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI-86), a measure of the severity of the impact at the thorax, was computed using the following relationship: [15,16] TTI-86 = 1.4*Age +. 5*[T12Y+MAX ( LURY, LLRY) ]*[Mass/165] To obtain the required peak acceleration values for the left upper rib (LURY) or the left lower rib (LLRY) inputs to this equation, the two accelerometers at each respective location were averaged together. The TTI-86 was calculated for assumed occupant ages 0, 23 and 41. Age 23 is the median age for all injured occupants while age 41 is the median age for occupants receiving serious to fatal injuries. [2] Once the TTI-86 's were determined for each aģe, the probability of injury was determined using the Injury Probability Scale proposed by NHTSA and depicted in Figure 7. [15, 16] This scale relates TTI-86 values to probabilities of injury for three injury severity classifications (AIS&gt;3, AIS&gt;4 and AIS&gt;5) using the 1980 Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS80) .

[20-27] Results significant to this paper are discussed in the following paragraphs. Sequential photographs of a typical test, depicting the impact event, are shown in Figure 8. Figure 8 - Typical Test Sequence Vehicle Results - Pertinent vehicle results determined from measurement and analysis of the impacting vehicle's behavior and summarized below include: Vehicle Velocity Results, Occupant Impact Velocity and Acceleration Results, and Static Crush Results. Vehicle Velocity Results - The nominal impact velocity for all tests was 30 mi/h. Table 11 lists the actual impact velocity for each test, as well as the vehicle's velocity change between impact and loss of contact with the support and the vehicle's exit speed following loss of contact. Occupant Impact Velocity &amp; Acceleration Results - Table 12 lists the "Flail Space" velocity change (lateral impact velocity of a theoretical unrestrained occupant against the occupant compartment interior) and the associated "Ridedown" acceleration (the theoretical occupant's maximum acceleration following contact with the interior surface) for each test. No guidelines exist regarding recommended maximum values of "Flail Space" velocity change and subsequent "Ridedown" acceleration for side impacts into luminaire supports. However, NCHRP Report No. 230 does specify maximum lateral values for angled vehicle impacts into the sides of roadside barriers and crash cushions. These recommended maximums are 15 ft/s and 15 g ' s for the "Flail Space" velocity change and the "Ridedown" acceleration, respectively, when no occupant compartment intrusion occurs. Static Crush Results - Table 13 lists the vehicle static crush measurements obtained from each test. Side Impact Dummy 1SID1 Results - Signifi- cant dummy results, summarized below, are separated into two categories: Head Injury Criteria (HIC) Results and Thoracic Injury Results. Head Injury Criteria (HIC) Results - Table 14 lists the HIC values obtained for each test. These values ranged from a low of 64 to a high near 9,000. In general, the tests in which the head impacted the luminaire support directly generated the higher HIC values. Lower HIC values resulted from impacts away from the dummy into the door or door frames. As previously described, HIC values were calculated using the procedures outlined in FMVSS 208 for frontal impacts. [13] Because of the design of the dummy head structure, HIC values can be considered accurate only when the impact is into the frontal portion of the head. Under frontal impact conditions, HIC values at or exceeding a threshold of 1000 are considered to produce serious life threatening or fatal injury. Because the side structure of the dummy head is not controlled or validated for impacts into the side of the dummy head, a threshold of 1000 cannot be used with the same degree of assurance as for frontal impacts. However, it is logical to assume that very high values, far in excess of 1000, can be expected to produce severe or fatal injuries. In addition, all values can be used 465</page><page sequence="9">Table 11 - Vehicle Velocity Results Test Number SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 Impact Speed (mi/h) 29.4 28.6 30.5 30.5 29.7 28.3 28.9 29.6 Velocity Change (mi/h) 6.1 28.6 4.1 6.1 8.4 28.3 10.2 4.9 (ft/s) (8.9) (41.9) (6.0) (8.9) (12.3) (41.5) (15.0) (7.2) Exit Speed (mi/h) 23.3 0.0 26.4 24.4 21.3 0.0 18.7 24.7 Table 12 - occupant Impact Lateral Velocity and Acceleration Results (Flail Space Velocity Change and Ridedown Acceleration) Test Number SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 Velocity Change(ft/s) 9.7 26.7 6.1 9.1 11.4 28.8 14.7 7.1 Acceleration (g) 1.5 8.4 2.3 1.5 3.1 4.9 3.5 2.0 Table 13 - Static Crush Results Test Number SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 Location Crush Measurements (in) Maximum 10.0 26.0 9.5 10.0 13.0 36.0 7.7 7.5 CI 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 C2 1.0 6.5 2.5 1.5 2.0 5.0 4.0 2.5 C3 3.0 25.0 7.5 9.0 10.5 12.0 5.5 6.0 C4 8.8 4.0 7.2 6.2 4.0 10.0 7.5 5.0 C5 3.5 1.5 3.7 3.0 1.2 4.0 7.0 3.0 C6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 L 77.0 104.0 63.0 60.0 94.0 157.0 47.5 64.0 D -22.5 -16.0 -16.0 -18.0 -23.0 -18.8 -9.8 -19.0 Table 14 - Head Injury Criteria (HIC) Values Test Number SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 HIC 1593 3385 8684 8026 64 2191 150 1996 Start (s) 0.02652 0.02553 0.01900 0.02075 0.01850 0.04513 0.04313 0.02613 Stop (s) 0.02940 0.03490 0.02200 0.02338 0.07663 0.06262 0.04688 0.02763 Del -T (s) 0.00288 0.00938 0.00300 0.00262 0.05813 0.01749 0.00375 0.00150 Table 15 - Lateral Acceleration Results (Peak Values) Test Number SI #1 SI #2 SI #3 SI #4 SI #5 SI #6 SI #7 SI #8 FIR Filtered Data T01Y (g) - - 167 150 100 - 17 67 T12Y (g) 151 - 172 160 68 101 15 48 LURY01 (g) - 253 280 232 51 117 9 132 LURYGA (g) - 331 271 218 55 127 11 135 LLRY01 (g) - 205 265 234 60 133 13 85 LLRYGA (g) - 220 169 218 61 171 16 87 Avg Upper (g) - 292 276 225 53 122 10 110 Avg Lower (g) - 213 217 226 60 152 15 86 466</page><page sequence="10">for relative comparison purposes when the same dummy is used for all tests.

Several are discussed below. A linear regression has been obtained for each correlation. The linear regression line for the data is shown on each graph along with the R squared coefficient which indicates the degree of correlation between the data and the regression line. R squared values near 1 indicate excellent correlation while those near 0 indicate very little correlation. No testing for statistical significance, regarding the regression curves obtained, has been attempted due to the limited number of data points available. Rather, the correlations are only intended to provide a gross indication of possible linkage between dummy based measures and vehicle based measures of injury severity. Thoracic In.iurv Versus Impact Location - Before beginning this test series, it was anticipated that side impacts aligned directly on the dummy would produce the more severe measures of occupant injury, and that when the impact was moved away from the dummy less severe measures of injury prediction would result. To ascertain the validity of this expectation (or lack thereof), several of the tests were conducted at different locations along the side of the vehicle. 400 i R Squared * 0.850 300[ j~ ~ [V V £ 200 - ' op □ ^ ūV 100 - 0 I- J I I 1 1 - I 0 10 20 30 40 LOCATION (IN) Figure 9 - TTI -86(41 ) Versus Impact Location Figure 9 shows the TT I - 86 (41) values (TTI-86 for an assumed occupant 41 years old) versus impact location relative to the dummy for tests with essentially equal breakaway force (tests 1, 3 through 6 and 7). The test using a trans- former base support (test 2) and the test using a slip base support for which the clamp load at the slip plane was essentially zero (test 8) were eliminated from this comparison due to radically different test setup conditions. The absolute value of the impact location relative to the dummy was used to obtain a uniform curve. The R squared coefficient for the comparison was 0.85. This high value indicates significant correlation between impact location and TTI -86(41 ) , with a decrease in thoracic injury levels as the impact point moves away from the dummy. This tends to confirm that impacts with the support aligned on the occupant location are the most severe, and that as the impact location moves away from the occupant location the severity decreases. Other Thoracic In.iurv Comparisons - Flail Space Velocity Change is a primary vehicle based measure of injury severity. When TTI -86(41 ) was compared with Flail Space Velocity Change for all tests, the R squared coefficient obtained was very low indicating a poor correlation. In Figure 10, the comparison is limited to those tests with identical impact locations, that is, 467</page><page sequence="11">aligned with the dummy (tests 1 through 4 and 8). The R squared correlation coefficient is 0.53. This R squared value indicates a moderate correlation between the two measures when this partial data set is used. Additionally, the slope of the regression curve is positive, indicating that lower values of TTI -86(41 ) result in lower values of Flail Space Velocity Change, as is expected. 400 1 - ^ □ soo - Q &lt;o 200 D CO ^ t- - □ 100 - R Squared = 0.525 o' ■ 1 » 1 « 1 ' 0 10 20 30 40 FLAIL SPACE VELOCITY CHANGE (FT/S) Figure 10 - TTI -86(41 ) Versus Flail Space Velocity Change 400 y/U 300 - p P - □/ ^ S' &lt;£ CO 200 - CO / i= ^ D 100 - R Squared = 0.657 0L 1 1 1 1 0 20 40 CRUSH (IN) Figure 11 - TTI -86 (41 ) Versus Static Crush Depth Vehicle Static Crush Depth is a secondary vehicle based measure of injury severity. When TTI -86(41 ) was compared with Static Crush Depth for all tests, the R squared coefficient obtained was very low (as in the previous comparison), again indicating a poor correlation. The com- parison was then limited to those tests where the impact was aligned with the dummy (tests 1 through 4 and 8). As shown in Figure 11 (a plot of this partial data set) the R squared coefficient obtained was 0.66, also indicating moderate correlation between the two measures. As was the case with the previous data set, the slope of the regression curve is positive indicating lower values of TTI -86(41 ) for lower values of Static Crush Depth, as expected. . Head In.iurv Comparisons - The Head Injury Criteria (HIC) computed for each test was com- pared in a similar manner (as TTI-86 in the previous discussion) to investigate possible relationships between dummy and vehicle borne measures of injury. 10 i □ 8 - p "¡a ! 6 - I 2: Dq o 1 1 1 1 i I i 0 10 20 30 40 FLAIL SPACE VELOCITY CHANGE (FT/S) Figure 12 - HIC Versus Flail Space Velocity Change 10 □ 8 - □ wT S 6 H R Squared = 0.027 i4" 2 - o □ oL i i i i 0 20 40 CRUSH (IN) Figure 13 - HIC Versus Crush HIC values were compared to Flail Space Velocity Change values for all tests. The associated R squared coefficient was 0.08. The partial set of tests comprised of all impacts aligned with the dummy is presented in Figure 12. Again, the associated R squared value is low, 0.08. These low correlation values indicate almost no correlation between HIC and Flail Space Velocity Change measures for both comparisons. This is in contrast to TTI -86(41 ) , where moderate correlation exists for the partial set of tests. This perhaps reflects the fact that the side impact dummy head and neck have not been designed and validated for impacts into the side of the head. It definitely reflects the fact that HIC values varied over a wide range (from a low of near 1600 to a high near 8700) for four data 468</page><page sequence="12">points where the Flail Space Velocity Changes were similar. The reason for this wide variation and resulting low correlation is not well understood at this time. HIC values were compared with Static Crush Depth for all tests. The resulting R squared coefficient was 0.01. When using HIC values from the partial set of tests, the R squared value was 0.03, as shown in Figure 13. As with the previously attempted correlation, HIC shows no correlation with Static Crush Depth. Again, the reason for this is not well understood. Recap of Comparisons - The above comparisons determined two potential candidates for use as vehicle based measures of thoracic injury severity, Flail Space Velocity Change and Static Crush Depth. Comparisons of these two measures with TTI -86(41) revealed a moderate correlation, with the crush being slightly higher. No additional tests for statistical significance were applied due to the limited amount of data. CONCLUSIONS For side impact collisions occurring in the "real world" into fixed roadside objects and roadside features, the impact point along the vehicle is random. That is, it is as likely for the impact to occur at a point on the vehicle aligned with the driver (or another occupant) as any other place along the vehicle. [10] In addition, depending upon the accident database queried, 60 to 90 percent of all fixed roadside object - side impact fatalities occur at speeds of 30 mi/h or below. [10] With occupant protection the ultimate goal, a reasonable "first cut" is to establish test criteria based on a reasonable worst case scenario, that is, impacts aligned with the occupant, broadside at a speed of 30 mi/h. Because occupant protection is the objective, a level of maximum injury allowable during controlled testing (that is, the test evaluation criteria) must also be established. With regard to thoracic injury, the probability of exceeding an AIS value of 3, 4 and 5 must be specified, together with the age of the occupant. For this research program, the NHTSA developed relationship between AIS and TTI-86 values (Figure 7) was selected and used. [15, 16] Additionally, an assumed occupant age of 41 years was used, based upon the knowledge that such an age represents the median for vehicle occupants receiving serious to fatal injuries. [2] Two preliminary relationships between dummy based measures of injury severity and vehicle based measures were determined. They were TTI-86 versus Flail Space Velocity Change (impact velocity of a theoretical unbelted occupant into the vehicle interior) and TTI-86 versus resultant Static Crush Depth. Figures 10 and 11 depict the preliminary curves obtained. Although not perfect from a correlation standpoint, a moderate relationship between variables was obtained with the limited data available. As previously stated, the slope of the two curves is sensible from a physical standpoint. That is, the slope is positive, indicating that lower values of TTI- 86 correspond to lower values of Flail Space Velocity Change and Static Crush Depth, respectively. However, the vertical axis intercept for the two regression curves ranges from TTI-86 values of approximately 150 to near 175 for zero values of Flail Space Velocity Change or Static Crush Depth. From a physical standpoint this lacks in credibility. One would expect that, for zero values of Velocity Change or Static Crush, thoracic injury would be minimal if at all. Therefore, it is anticipated that the true relationships are non-linear with the curves emanating from (or near to) the origin formed by each respective axis. To better characterize these two relationships and to provide for statistical sufficiency, additional tests at lessor severities and at greater severities (under identical test conditions) are required. This test program must be thorough enough to allow for quantification of one (or both) of these relationships. Once this information is in hand, a side impact injury predictor, based upon vehicle response, can be formulated. RECOMMENDATIONS Based upon the results of the side impact - narrow fixed roadside object research program described in this paper, the following recommendations are proposed: 1. To better characterize the relationships between TTI-86 and both Flail Space Velocity Change and Static Crush Depth, additional testing at lower impact speeds into the slipbase luminaire support described in this paper is recommended, as well as higher speed impacts into the same luminaire support or higher severity impacts into different supports. This is to provide for lower severity and higher severity (from an occupant injury perspective) data points, necessary to completely define these relationships, and to provide for sufficient additional data points to obtain statistically significant relationships. 2. Because of the lack of stiffness present in the side structure of currently available small cars (weighing about 2,000 lb or less), it is anticipated that just a few inches of static crush (perhaps less than 6 in) may result in high values of the TTI-86 indicator and a resultant large potential for serious to fatal thoracic injury. This is because, even with the best of breakaway supports currently available on our nation's roadways, significant intrusion occurs before sufficient breakaway force is attained, the support releases and contact against the car is terminated. Additionally, many of the side impact fatalities resulting from collisions with fixed roadside objects are due to collisions with trees and utility poles, both of which are non-breakaway (from Table 2, trees and utility poles account for in excess of 50 percent of such fatalities). Many of these are on city streets, local roads and farm to market roads under the jurisdiction of numerous city, county and other local governmental agencies - many of which may 469</page><page sequence="13">not be fully aware of the potential adverse safety consequences regarding placement of objects in close proximity to the roadway. Because of this, it is recommended that the side stiffness of such cars, particularly at the lower sill and the upper roof line, be increased to the extent economically feasible (both from an initial cost standpoint, due to a potential for increased material costs, and from a continuing or operating cost standpoint, due to a potential for increased car weights). 3. subsequent to additional research involving side impacts into narrow roadside objects - research to better understand how injuries are caused and to establish and quantify one or more surrogate measures of occupant injury severity based upon test vehicle response parameters - design improvements to breakaway luminaire supports are also necessary. With the exception of test 2, all research conducted in the latest series of tests involved a breakaway luminaire support representative of the best (from a safety standpoint) of such devices currently in use on our nation's highways. Test 2, which involved a breakaway support more representative of the average currently in use, did not breakaway (that is, under side impact conditions it behaved in a manner similar to a fixed, rigid narrow object). One test does not fully characterize any particular breakaway support's safety performance under side impact test conditions. However, it does tend to indi- cate that design improvements may be warranted. Even with the better breakaway support, during test 6 it also did not breakaway - again, indicating that design improvements may be warranted. The reason for this failure is thought to be due to substantial engagement between the lower car sill and the fixed base of the luminaire support (which is only three inches high), although this hypothesis was never conclusively proved. As a result of this, it is felt that stub heights for side impact compatible supports may need to be lower than currently required (the current requirement isa maximum of four inches). Additionally, during all tests conducted directly in line with the dummy, substantial head contact and resultant high HIC values occurred. Therefore, techniques to limit head contact or to mitigate head trauma require attention if such injuries are to be reduced or eliminated. And finally, techniques to minimize or reduce intrusion of the narrow support into the occupant compartment (prior to breakaway, release and loss of contact) are deemed necessary to provide for acceptable levels of thoracic and pelvic injury resulting from side impact - fixed object collisions involving today's smaller cars. 4. In any follow-on research program to better characterize the relationships between TTI-86 and either Flail Space Velocity Change or Static Crush Depth, surrogate measures (based upon test vehicle responses) of estimating pelvic injury should also be developed. This is to ensure that countermeasures subsequently developed for side impact compatible breakaway supports do not reduce thoracic injury potential at the expense of pelvic injury potential. 5. A test program (or programs) consisting of tests of increasing impact severity near, but not directly on, the dummy may be warranted. This would provide for a parallel curve (or series of curves) relating thoracic and pelvic injury to vehicle based surrogate measures of injury severity. The result would be to characterize the entire area around a vehicle occupant (involved in a side impact accident with a narrow roadside device) from an injury potential standpoint. For example, perhaps a series of tests 6 in (or 12 in) forward (or rearward) from the shoulder of the dummy may be appropriate. In this manner, not only would a relationship for injury potential from impacts directly on the occupant be developed, but a related relationship (or relationships) would be developed for equally severe impacts with potentially less severe results on the vehicle occupant. The end result would be a better understanding of the side impact environment from an occupant injury potential standpoint. 6. In the future, consideration should be given to developing a computer model (preferably PC compatible) simulating a side impact into roadside objects. Such a simulation should be developed in stages. That is, first a relatively simple simulation should be formulated, validated to the extent feasible by existing test results, with improvements incorporated as understanding of the side impact - fixed roadside object accident environment increases. This simulation could include a lumped mass occupant model (inside the vehicle) if deemed desirable or necessary. In time, assuming acceptable results are forthcoming, this simulation could be used for further refinements to surrogate measures for injury prediction, as well as for safety improve- ments to roadside hardware.
