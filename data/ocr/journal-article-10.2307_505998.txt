Pp. 172, figs. 38, ills. 48. Stock- holm 1984. GRIECHISCHE FLUSSGOTTHEITEN IN VORHELLENISTI- SCHER ZEIT, by Carina Weiss. (Beitrdige zur Ar- chdiologie 17.) Pp. 256, pls. 16. Wiirzburg 1984. Comprehensive studies of mythological representations of specific heroes and deities are always welcome additions to the archaeological literature and one always hopes that a new study will help to solve old problems. Ahlberg-Cornell presents 137 examples of Herakles and the sea-monster out of a total of 161 known to her. Her book begins with a general introduction followed by the catalogue in which the material is divided into 12 groups that are ar- ranged chronologically. Then come 6 chapters that discuss these 12 groups in considerable detail. For each of these 12</page><page sequence="2">1986] BOOK REVIEWS 109 groups, the catalogue entries are repeated, but without bib- liographical citations. Presenting full catalogue entries for each group before it is discussed would have been a prefer- able arrangement for it would save the reader having to turn to the full catalogue to see if a vase is attributed or pub- lished. Discussion of each group of representations is di- vided into subheadings: state of preservation; dating and at- tribution; iconographical outline; development. Since the chronological framework for Attic black figure is well estab- lished and since very many of the vases in this book are at- tributed, it is not really necessary to give so much stylistic analysis under each "Dating and Attribution" subheading. This draws the reader's attention away from the real pur- pose of the book. After this, there are four more chapters: iconographic conclusions; iconographic context; develop- ment of theme; significance of theme. There is much repeti- tion of material in these 4 chapters; surely they could have been condensed into one. On p. 11, note 5, Ahlberg-Cornell states that studies by Brize (Die Geryoneis des Stesichoros und die friihe griechische Kunst [Wdirzburg 1980] esp. 66-105) and Glynn ("Herakles, Nereus and Triton: A Study of Iconography in Sixth Century Athens," AJA 85 [1981] 121-32) appeared too late to be included. This is a pity for they drew somewhat different conclusions from those of the author and Brize mentions a fragment of a neck-amphora found at Taranto that is signed by Exekias as potter and painter and has the earliest inscribed example of Triton. The text concludes with an appendix, an index of museums and collections, then four lists: bibliographical; periodicals; literary sources; and illustrations. Pictures of the material are arranged by catalogue number and one of the best features of the book is that every vase is illustrated, though a few photographs are too dark (e.g., IV, 11; V, 4; X, 13). It is maddening, however, that the illustrations are not referred to in the text; to find a vase, one must know its catalogue number, then leaf through the plates. The iconographical outline and the development within each group are chronicled in considerable detail from the earliest representations coming from the workshop of the Gorgon Painter to the latest ones by the Theseus Painter and the CHC Group. Early representations show the hero straddling the monster, their torsos in profile, but by mid- century, when the chests of both hero and monster are shown frontally for the first time and in a true attack, the result is a fully integrated group that is repeated again and again with minor variations and with occasional inclusion of spectators or allusions to the aquatic setting. Before 560, the monster represented is Nereus; afterwards, it is Triton, and in these scenes, Nereus sometimes appears as an old man looking on. From the very beginning, the sea-monster Nereus was conceived and thought of as entirely different from the younger monster Triton. Glynn (p. 132), following Boardman, suggests that the change from Nereus to Triton was a Peisistratid idea to commemorate sucessful Athenian activity at Sigeion (having Herakles fight Triton would be more suitable than having him attack the gentle Nereus). Brize (p. 99) attributes the change to the development of art in the 6th c. Ahlberg-Cornell (pp. 102-103) associates Ne- reus with the social reforms of Solon, but seems reluctant to take a position on the reason for the change from Nereus to Triton. Specific comments: p. 13: Berlin inv. 3764: the lion-headed sea-monster has a human head in its jaws (cf. AB V 11.19); this can hardly be interpreted as denoting "three successive stages of the meta- morphosis: human, lion and fish" (p. 100). p. 14: On Olympia B 1881, the sea-monster's body is cov- ered with scales, not "with small round knobs". p. 15: to refer to incision here and elsewhere as "needle- work" is particularly inaccurate. p. 19: Akrop. 733: the larger fragment is mispoised. One wishes the author had attempted a reconstruction drawing of this composition as she did for some of the others. p. 32: the attribution of Boston 99.522 (IV, 9) to the Ta- leides Painter does not seem quite right for the drawing is too fussy, not bold enough. p. 33: why compare the two Taleides Painter's hydriai stylistically detail-for-detail when the attributions are firm? p. 40: the author suggests that Boston 01.8058 (V, 2) and Toledo 1956.69 (V, 79) are by the same potter, but she only illustrates each panel, not the whole vase. In any case, this is irrelevant to the study. p. 41: Copenhagen, Thor. M 41: the artist has not mis- understood the position of the lionskin's paw; it hangs down right alongside Herakles' right thigh, overlapping the chest of Triton a little bit. p. 60: Ahlberg-Cornell wants to establish a relationship between the scenes by the Taleides Painter (ca. 540) and those by the Chiusi Painter (ca. 510). Recognizing a chro- nological problem, she conjectures "that the Taleides Paint- er is identical with the young Chiusi Painter, who took with him his sketch-books to the Leagros Workshop." Does the author really mean to say that the two painters are one and the same man? p. 90: I cannot seem to find the three footnotes that go with this page. Misprints are rather numerous in this book (e.g. "mon- struous" is used throughout for "monstrous") but if there is one overwhelming flaw it is with the style of writing. Three examples may suffice to illustrate the problem: p. 18: "The principle of human figures rowing may have caught the interest in the wedding themes of Helena and Menelaos and Peleus and Thetis which are predominant among the few mythical themes in the motif stock of Sophi- los." What the author is discussing is that processions of men and women begin in the work of Sophilos. p. 20: "One could interfere, in fact, that Herakles looks round as the result of a reminiscence from a prototype with animal protomes but not entirely disregard the possibility that here, for space reasons the painter consciously omitted a protome, which would then be hinted to by the turned off head only." pp. 58-59: "On the hydria (10) Herakles is shown in a deeper kneeling posture, with his upper body in a more backward postion, while the sea-monster's head is in an ac- centuatedly low placing."</page><page sequence="3">110 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 90 There is much useful material in this book, but at times it is like having to solve the riddle of the Sphinx to figure out what the author is trying to say. Ahlberg-Cornell promises a forthcoming study entitled "The Painter of Berlin 1686, Group E, and Exekias" (p. 38, note 26) and one of the Lea- gros Group (p. 56). These sound important and one hopes that she will have the assistance of a capable editor. The material deserves it. Turning now from salt water to fresh, Weiss presents an interesting study of river gods in pre-Hellenistic Greek Art. At the very outset, she states that her purpose is not to dupli- cate what has been done by others (especially by H.-P. Isler, Acheloos [Bern 1970]), but rather to show what great vari- ety exists in the rendering of river gods before the Hellenis- tic period. The main forms are the bull with human head, the bull-human-fish combination, and the horned or un- horned youth or man. Not always is it possible to determine exactly which god is being depicted, except for the early rep- resentations of Okeanos and those of Acheloos where Hera- kles or Deianeira appear. It is mainly in the 5th c. that the distinctions between specific river gods become somewhat blurred and only an inscription or a mythological setting can identify the river god represented. Weiss is particularly interested in the genesis of the river god in fully human form (sometimes with horns) for she wants to show that the fully human reclining river god is not an invention of the Hellen- istic era, but of the Classical, specifically in the East pedi- ment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and the West pedi- ment of the Parthenon. In ch. I, Weiss discusses river gods in Homer and the possibility that he describes rivers in human shape, espe- cially in Iliad 20.7 ff. where rivers may be understood as having "g6ttliche Pers6nlichkeiten" and 21.212 ff. where the Skamander is described as taking mortal likeness. Chs. II and III are devoted mainly to the cities of Sicily and South Italy which show river gods on their coins and it is surely no accident that all of these cities are located by or near a river, a point that the author stresses. Many of these river gods take the man-bull form which strongly suggests that this form was not always reserved for Acheloos. In this point, Weiss (p. 66) differs from Isler who interprets all man-bull forms on west Greek coins as Acheloos, and Weiss is perhaps correct to say that if all these river gods represent Acheloos, it would play down the official character of the coinage of a city which would naturally want to have its own river god represented. Ch. IV deals with the significance of the bull for the iconography of Greek river gods and shows that it can have many meanings, but always one associated with water, growth, and fertility, as well as with certain deities such as Poseidon, Dionysos, Demeter and Kore, and sometimes even Artemis. Having established in the preceding chapters that on oc- casion in the 5th c. B.C. a river god can appear in complete- ly human form, in ch. V Weiss presents this change as an invention of the 5th c. and asks why the transformation to a purely anthropomorphic form takes place, as seen for exam- ple in the stamnos by Hermonax in the Vatican (ARV2 484.21) where Asopos (inscribed) appears as a bearded old man with his daughter Aigina and Zeus. Weiss points out that in the Classical period monsters have more plausible forms and are often more humanized than before. She then suggests (p. 104) that the human form of the river god in art may be attributed to the designer of the Olympia pediment, though later in the chapter she does not exclude a depen- dency upon theater. Ch. VI brings us right to the heart of matters: the reclin- ing figures in the East pediment at Olympia (A and P) as well as the corner figures in the West pediment of the Par- thenon (A and W). Weiss believes Pausanias' description of the corner figures in the Olympia pediment as personifica- tions of the river Alpheios and its tributary Kladeos to be correct and she opts for "right" and "left" of Zeus as Zeus' proper left and right, not that of the viewer. She admits (p. 129), however, that Pausanias is ambiguous in this detail. Her interpretation, agreed upon by many scholars, makes A (the older figure) Alpheios, and P (the younger figure) Kla- deos, which coincides with their respective locations in rela- tion to the temple. Thus, figures K and G on Zeus' right would be Hippodameia and Pelops and figures J and F on his left Oinomaos and Sterope. The real problem with this arrangement lies in the interpretation of what figures K, G, J, and F are doing with respect to each other and to Zeus. First of all, if Weiss' arrangement is accepted, it means that the spear held by Oinomaos appears between him and Ste- rope and the one held by Pelops appears between him and Hippodameia. Thus, each spear would act as a divider of each pair; it makes much better sense iconographically and compositionally for the spears to be placed between king and Zeus and Zeus and suitor, therefore separating the Olympian world from that of mortals and emphasizing Zeus' appearance as an unseen but felt presence. Further- more, if Sterope and Oinomaos (F and J) and Pelops and Hippodameia (G and K) are switched around so that the sequence of the five central figures is F, J, H, (Zeus), G, K, the subtle interaction of Oinomaos dictating the terms of the race and Pelops listening intently would be stressed for Oi- nomaos would look towards Pelops instead of away (cf. Sif- lund, fig. 56 for this arrangement). The degree of emotion and the interaction of figures in Early Classical representa- tions are well documented and given the expressiveness of so many other figures in the sculptures of this temple, it would seem wrong to disregard it here. The arrangement of the five central figures (following the detailed discussion by Saf- lund) would force us to give up the river god theory for A and P (a tributary cannot be older than its source) and see these figures as spectators. Firmly believing Figures A and P at Olympia to be the earliest examples of reclining river gods in Greek art, Weiss then proceeds to tackle the knotty problem of identifying Figures A and W in the West pediment of the Parthenon and she opts for A as a river god and W as a spring. Weiss suggests A might be Kephissos, Ilissos, or Eridanos, and W Zeuxippe, Praxithea, or perhaps Kallihrroe. While one would like to know who these (and other) figures are, we perhaps do not yet have quite enough evidence to be sure of a firm identification. The same may also be said for the very fragmentary figure in the West pediment at Tegea. In ch. VII Weiss discusses funerary banquet reliefs as well as representations of the reclining Dionysos and Hera-</page><page sequence="4">1986] BOOK REVIEWS 111 kles for the evidence they may furnish for the 5th c. inven- tion of the reclining river god. Once again the evidence for an early connection seems a bit inconclusive. In the last chapter, VIII, Weiss deals with the few late 5th and 4th c. votive reliefs that have river gods on them. Since all of these river gods are shown standing, it seems to undermine Weiss' contention that the reclining river god appears as early as the 5th c. Her book concludes with a brief catalogue (Okea- nos at the Wedding of Peleus and Thetis; Acheloos in hu- man form; local river gods), a list of abbreviations, a general index, and plate captions. Greek water gods have many different forms and these studies, particularly the latter, make clear how complicated aquatic iconography in Greek art may be. MARY B.
