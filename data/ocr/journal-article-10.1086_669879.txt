      <p>Abraham Stoll offers significant insights on monotheism, a term coined in the seventeenth century by the Cambridge Platonist Henry More in his <italic>Mystery of Godliness</italic> (1660). Strongly informing this discussion is Jan Assmann’s <italic>Moses the Egyptian</italic>, inspired by Freud’s analysis of Moses, and in particular Assmann’s claim on “the Mosaic distinction—the border between the true religion of monotheism and the falsehood of polytheism” (28). Assmann explores the Egyptology of such figures significant to the emergence of deism as Ralph Cudworth and John Toland. <sup>1</sup> Stoll clearly, and justly, admires <italic>Moses the Egyptian</italic>. He might also have admired the economy of expression that allows Assmann’s argument to shine: <italic>Milton and Monotheism</italic> is twice as long as it should be.</p>
      <p>Monotheistic narrative, Stoll emphasizes, makes the border of the Mosaic distinction difficult to defend: in becoming a literary character, God is no longer an abstract principle and displays the anthropomorphism typical of pagan gods. In an informed first chapter, Stoll surveys several responses to this challenge. Tasso privileges the story world's verisimilarity to principles of truth, rather than to elements of reality. One way of sidestepping the problem is to eliminate the supernatural in epic poetry altogether, as Davenant does with such uninspiring results in <italic>Gondibert</italic> (1651). For all that Cowley finds a way to praise that work, his own <italic>Davideis</italic> (1656) makes a case for a biblical supernatural befitting epic poetry, and his notes duplicate the practice of Selden’s commentary on Drayton’s <italic>Poly-Olbion</italic> (1612), where poetic fancy is dutifully counterbalanced by the apparatus in a way that creates, in Stoll’s perceptive reading, “an attenuated version of narrative presence” (61). We see Milton’s anxious defense of the border between monotheism and paganism in his history of human idolatry in book 1 of <italic>Paradise Lost</italic>, itself drawn from Selden’s <italic>De diis Syris</italic> (1617), in its information on pagan gods, its comparatist approach of situating a broad range of idols in historical and geographical context, and its suggestion that the properties of the pagan gods are translatable from one to the next (32, 66).</p>
      <p>Chapter 2 focuses on “occult monotheism,” the principle in comparative religion that monotheism can be found in the background of polytheistic worship. Selden’s work again proves to be central to this narrative, particularly in the manuscript circulation informing <italic>Purchas his Pilgrimage</italic> (1613), with its view that history more than poetry respects proscriptions against idolatry (74–76). Gerardus Vossius develops Selden’s research in his <italic>De theologia gentili</italic> (1641), which informs the thought of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. In Cherbury’s “radical theology,” pagan and Christian religions are continuous to the extent that “the traditions of Judeo-Christian revelation may not be necessary” and indeed amount to little more than the wiles of priestcraft (81–82). Henry More rejects this position for its “lack of mystery,” namely, its cutting off the believer from the possibility of direct contact with the divine through miracle and revelation (89–90).</p>
      <p>Milton is positioned vis-à-vis latitudinarianism, Socinianism, and emerging deism in chapter 5. As is well known, the diary of Lieuwe van Aitzema suggests that Milton licensed for publication the Socinian <italic>Racovian Catechism</italic> (1651; trans. John Biddle, 1652), <sup>2</sup> and, as Stoll points out, John Dennis described Milton as “a little tainted with Socinianism” (quoted on 188). Cleaving to the principle of <italic>sola Scriptura</italic> and adopting the scholarly insights of Erasmus and the Socinians, Milton’s antitrinitarian statements in <italic>De doctrina Christiana</italic> cast doubt on the biblical passages suggesting a triune Godhead, 1 Timothy 3:16 and 1 John 5:7, the latter of which Erasmus eliminated from his New Testament as a “Latin interpolation” (191). Stoll points to Milton’s clear statement in <italic>De doctrina</italic> that the Son was begotten in time, a principle on display in the Son “begotten” by the Father’s “decree” in <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> (221–22). Milton’s epic is also consistent with his treatise in making the Son the instrument of the Father’s will in the Creation (229).</p>
      <p>Stoll describes Milton’s 1671 poems, <italic>Paradise Regained</italic> and <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic>, as experiments in a divine order lacking revelation. Though <italic>Paradise Regained</italic> offers a Jesus that is almost entirely human in a way recalling Socinianism, the final announcement by the angelic choir offers, Stoll argues following John Rogers, a “Christology that is specifically opposed to Socinianism” (233). The brief epic is thus a “serious experiment in the Socinian view,” and one that denies the Son’s divine attributes and his role as mediator (241). Here Stoll might have distinguished more clearly the heavenly Son and the incarnate Christ. In <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> we see the heavenly Son endowed with divine attributes and functioning as mediator from the moment that prevenient grace first moves Adam and Eve to repent: “all his works on mee / Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those / Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.” <sup>3</sup> The question is how much of that divinity remains in the god-man Jesus, a question on which Barbara Lewalski offers indispensable insight in her classic study <italic>Milton’s Brief Epic</italic>. Stoll dutifully cites this book but does not fully incorporate its scholarship. In <italic>Paradise Regained</italic>, Lewalski avers, Milton’s incarnate Christ displays <italic>kenosis</italic>, or “an emptying of divine attributes and powers,” which is consistent with <italic>De doctrina</italic> and its reading of Philippians 2:6–8. <sup>4</sup> Stoll suggests less persuasively that <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> and <italic>Paradise Regained</italic> are simply at odds in their view of the Son.</p>
      <p>If <italic>Paradise Regained</italic> finally claims the necessity of revelation against the Socinian view, <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic> addresses “the more opaque phenomenon of internal revelation” (265). In his seventh chapter, Stoll critiques Milton’s brief tragedy, though in a way revealing that he has sipped from the enchanting cup of those critics who willfully misread the text. Finding ingenious ways to set Milton against the traditions to which he adhered by divorcing Samson’s final act from divine inspiration has become something of a critical subspecialty, to which Stoll contributes in associating <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic> with Cherbury’s skepticism on internal motions (284–86). The angel of Judges 13, Stoll correctly notes, has no direct presence in Milton’s dramatic poem (272), and Milton does not introduce angels as Joost van den Vondel does in his tragedy <italic>Samson, or Holy Revenge</italic> (1660). But Stoll proceeds to the fallacy that Vondel’s tragedy proves the “necessity of angels to theodicy” (307). By this argument the supposed absence of revelation in <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic> defends the use in <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> of “angels and other forms of the supernatural” (308).</p>
      <p>Milton did take the existence of angels seriously, but he never presents them as necessary to revelation. Such necessity would associate Milton with something like a Dionysian order where revelation must pass through the angelic ranks on its way to humanity, a view that he strongly rejects—and that is equally rejected among the reformers and such fathers as Chrysostom. <sup>5</sup> Samson’s heroism of faith amounts to a quieting of human confusion and attunement to the kind of divine promptings he experiences in his marriage to the woman of Timnath and in his “rouzing motions.” <sup>6</sup> In his excellent reading of <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic>, Norman T. Burns identifies Samson’s development with antinomianism—that important article, and indeed a good deal of careful scholarship on <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic>, goes entirely unnoticed in this chapter. <sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Here we see the limits of Stoll’s approach to “monotheism,” by which he means the specific approach to monotheistic faith adopted in comparative religion, Socinianinsm, and emerging deism. Milton’s views on the Son do seem to have been influenced by the Socinians, but the dialogue of <italic>De doctrina Christiana</italic> with Ramist logic and the tradition of reformed systematic theologies—debts especially revealed by recent textual criticism of the tract—could receive more attention. <sup>8</sup> Although Stoll is often careful to indicate the distance between Milton and thinkers like Cherbury, that care breaks down in the case of <italic>Samson Agonistes</italic>.</p>
      <p>We might also raise questions about the discussion of Genesis 18 taken up in chapter 3. This is a strong chapter in several respects, arguing perceptively that <italic>Paradise Lost</italic> engages at key moments Abraham’s conversation with God over the fate of Sodom (Gen. 18:22–33). Milton describes the exchange in <italic>The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</italic> (1643) as one where “Abraham, ev’n to the face of God himselfe, seem’d to doubt of divine justice, if it should swerve from that irradiation wherwith it had enlight’ned the mind of man, and bound it selfe to its own rule” (quoted in Stoll, 104, 109, 134). Stoll leans on this passage rather heavily as decisive evidence that Milton’s God must adhere to principles of justice discernible to humankind. The common reformed view is that Abraham is making a humane intercession that pleases God in its display of mercy. <sup>9</sup> Stoll presents the passage as Abraham justifying the view of a “mechanical God” to be held to principles discernible to humanity; in the same spirit as Abraham in Genesis, the Son “ostentatiously disciplines God” in book 3 (110) and Adam is “disciplining” God when he requests a mate (136). These arguments fail to convince in that both episodes seem much more like the unfolding of God’s own intentions than they do moments of correction.</p>
      <p>Stoll’s book places Milton at some distance from the likes of Cherbury and Toland but may have placed him further still. Milton takes seriously the “inlibration” of God, and offers, as Phillip Donnelly has suggested, a view of right reason that must harmonize itself with the revelations of scripture and direct divine prompting. <sup>10</sup> Fuller clarity on that point might have made this book’s readings of Milton more even. But as a book on the emergence of “monotheism” in seventeenth-century comparative religion, Socinianism, and deism, it offers a good deal of outstanding scholarship.</p>
