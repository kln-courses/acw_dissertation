<plain_text><page sequence="1">IAN MACKENZIE Terrible Beauty: Paul de Man's Retreat from the Aesthetic Five years after writing that "Death is a dis- placed name for a linguistic predicament" Paul de Man died of a brain tumor, leaving Derrida to point out the correspondence, in French, between tumeur and tu meurs.1 De Man's unfortunate death sadly prevented him from completing a remarkable but perplexing set of essays detailing and attacking what he described as "the aesthetic ideology." In the short time since de Man's so- called "juvenile" wartime writings were redis- covered, it has become a commonplace to claim, with the inestimable benefit of hindsight, that the account of the aesthetic contained in his final work can only be explained as an attempt to redeem or exorcise his wartime espousal of an implicitly fascist notion of aesthetic totality. It remains to be argued that de Man's later attack on the aesthetic is misguided, or more specifi- cally, that whatever Anschluss of aesthetics may have occurred in the Third Reich, the notion of the aesthetic is not as inherently dangerous as de Man seeks to make out. As early as the mid-1950s, de Man attempted to show-quite rightly-that the "aesthetic" or "poetic" use of language does not allow it to match phenomenal experience. In the essays on literary theory and theorists posthumously col- lected in The Resistance to Theory, he put for- ward the more radical argument that rhetoric has no aesthetic component. In another series of essays, some of which still await publication, he took issue with Schiller's claim that an aesthetic education can produce in individuals an aes- thetic state that will enable them to live in har- mony with their fellow human beings in an aes- thetic State.2 He persuasively links Schiller's advocacy of pure form [Gestalt] and aesthetic semblance [Schein] with the extraordinary proposition to be found in Kleist's short story "Uber das Marionettentheater" that formal per- fection can best be achieved by mechanization and mutilation. He describes Schiller's argu- ment as a grievous misreading of Kant, but shows how Schiller was in turn misread and appropriated by Goebbels. De Man argues that "the Schillerian aesthetic categories, whether we know it or not, are still the taken-for-granted premises of our own pedagogical, historical, and political categories" (Romanticism, p. 266), and that "it is as a political force that the aes- thetic still concerns us as one of the most pow- erful ideological drives to act upon the reality of history" (p. 264). I will first oppose de Man's argument that tropes are wholly cognitive and devoid of any aesthetic function. I will then consider Schil- ler's use of Kant's Critique of Judgement in his series of letters On the Aesthetic Education of Man. I will try to show that the mechanization and formalization described in Kleist's story and practiced in the Third Reich have no neces- sary relation with de Man's account of the me- chanical nature of language, and that even though fascism can be partially redescribed in aesthetic terms, its essence remains power rather than language or form. I will conclude by arguing that Bakhtin's notion of dialogism equally disposes of the naive belief that lan- guage can capture phenomenal reality, but with- out the necessity of conceiving of language as mechanical. Where dialogism is suppressed, it is by the human agency of power, even though this may hide behind an aesthetic facade. RHETORIC AND AESTHETICS In various essays in The Resistance to Theory, de Man sets up parallel distinctions between The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 51:4 Fall 1993</page><page sequence="2">552 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism hermeneutics and poetics, and between aes- thetics and rhetoric. He raises "the fundamental question of the compatibility between the de- scriptive discourse of poetics and the normative discourse of hermeneutics," and insists that rhe- torical figures and tropes belong to the realm of the cognitive rather than that of the aesthetic.3 Hermeneutics attempts to determine the mean- ing of specific texts, and as such, de Man writes, "it postulates a transcendental function of un- derstanding, no matter how complex, deferred, or tenuous it might be, and will, in however mediated a way, have to raise questions about the extralinguistic truth value of literary texts" (pp. 55-56). Poetics, on the contrary, is a meta- linguistic, descriptive or prescriptive, and would- be scientific discipline, concerned with the tax- onomy and the interaction of poetic structures. The orthodox starting point in the attempt to discover the meaning of a text is to read it (ex- cept for those undergraduates who persist in going to the library to find the chapter by a helpful critic that will save them the effort), but this is not reading in de Man's sense. In her- meneutics, he writes, "reading necessarily in- tervenes, but like computation in algebraic proof, it is a means toward an end, a means that should finally become transparent and super- fluous; the ultimate aim of a hermeneutically successful reading is to do away with reading altogether" (p. 56). De Manian poetics, on the contrary, involves slow, careful, rigorous read- ing, leading to "the formal analysis of linguistic entities as such, independently of signification" (p. 56). De Man recalls a particular course at Harvard in which he was encouraged to start out from the bafflement that ... singular turns of tone, phrase, and figure were bound to produce in readers attentive enough to notice them and honest enough not to hide their non-understanding behind the screen of received ideas that often passes, in liter- ary instruction, for humanistic knowledge. (p. 23)4 The literary or linguistic reading that de Man seems to be calling for is purely formal, which is to say rhetorical rather than aesthetic. It "choose[s] to hear" what a text "actually says" rather than what it wishes to say, it considers "the modalities of production and reception of meaning and value prior to their establishment" (p. 7), and it "designates reference prior to des- ignating the referent" (p. 8). Since the impos- sibility of reading and of analyzing singular turns of tone, phrase, and figure independently of signification before making a decision as to their signification hardly needs to be pointed out,5 it seems necessary, at the very least, to read de Man's "prior to" in the light of his earlier statement that temporal concepts acquire a particularly rich complexity when made to refer to linguistic events.6 At the end of "Shel- ley Disfigured" (in Romanticism) and else- where, de Man recognizes that reading invariably proceeds by way of understanding, aesthetifica- tion, historicization, and monumentalization, while in "Reading and History," he points out with reference to the metaphor "Achilles is a lion," that "one has to have 'read' the text in terms of poetics to arrive at a hermeneutic con- clusion. One has to have become aware that it is a figure. ... But one also has to read it herme- neutically to 'understand' it as poetics" (Resis- tance, p. 56). Without either experience or an intuition of metaphors, the reader would make the hermeneutically disastrous deduction that Achilles was a large, tawny-colored, predatory, carnivorous, feline quadruped. But without an awareness of the difference between Greek heroes and large, tawny-colored, predatory, car- nivorous, feline quadrupeds, the reader would not be able to recognize the metaphor. Conse- quently, de Man concedes, "hermeneutics and poetics, different and distinct as they are, have a way of becoming entangled" (p. 56). But so do rhetoric and aesthetics, despite de Man's claim that "Attention to the philological or rhetorical devices of language is not the same as aesthetic appreciation, although the latter can be a way of access to the former" (p. 24). The corollary of close reading is that "litera- ture, instead of being taught only as a historical and humanistic subject, should be taught as a rhetoric and a poetics prior to being taught as a hermeneutics and a history" (pp. 25-26). De Man stresses that what most people call close reading but what he calls "mere reading" is "deeply subversive to those who think of the teaching of literature as a substitute for the teach- ing of theology, ethics, psychology, or intellec- tual history." Most readers, de Man claims, are willfully blind to the materiality of language and the subversive potential of tropes. The close reader, on the contrary, "cannot fail to respond</page><page sequence="3">MacKenzie Terrible Beauty: Paul de Man's Retreat 553 to structures of language which it is the more or less hidden aim of literary teaching to keep hid- den" (p. 24). De Man insists that if one reads attentively, without ignoring problematic figu- ral structures and textual aberrations, "the attri- bution of a reliable, or even exemplary, cog- nitive and, by extension, ethical function to literature ... becomes much more difficult" (p. 25). The correct reading of literature casts grave doubt on the Kantian notion that aes- thetics can reconcile pure and practical reason, or link a priori judgments with sensuous percep- tions: "Literary theory raises the unavoidable question whether aesthetic values can be com- patible with the linguistic structures that make up the entities from which these values are de- rived" (p. 25). Yet de Man's literary theory, and the close reading (or "the return to philology") that it claims to enable, rest on a moment-that de Man knows to be impossible-in which the reader studies linguistic structures before they begin to signify. Furthermore, the opposition of aesthetics and rhetoric as mutually exclusive terms is highly tendentious, if not wholly untenable. The stan- dard definition of rhetoric is that it is part of persuasive communication. Theorists of rheto- ric have always argued that persuasion involves, among other things, putting an audience in a suitable frame of mind, by way of pathos. The duties of an orator are traditionally listed as movere, docere and delectare-to arouse an audience's emotions, to instruct, and to do good or to give pleasure. (Plato, in his underhand attack on rhetoric in the Gorgias, rejects the idea that rhetoric can move and instruct, and has Socrates argue that it can only please; an idea echoed by Kant in the Critique of Judgement.) Classical rhetoric also enumerates five stages of composition, one of which is elocutio, the use of language appropriate to a subject matter, in- cluding figures and other stylistic devices. Fig- ures have often been subdivided into tropes, which involve a transference of meaning on a conceptual level, and schemes, which involve the reordering of words into a structure that goes beyond minimal communicative needs. The necessary overlap between rhetoric and poetics (particularly formalism) appears to be almost self-evident, as does that between rheto- ric and aesthetics, or the perception of (sym- bolic) beauty. Indeed, as Wilkinson and Wil- loughby point out in their bilingual edition of Schiller's Letters on Aesthetic Education, "Many have thought that Baumgarten [who first used the word dsthetisch in its modem sense in 1750] was simply giving a new name to an old thing, viz. Rhetoric and Poetics."7 De Man's notion of rhetoric, of course, rather differs from the traditional definition. He argues that all words, names, and concepts are meta- phorical at root so that language is a system of metaphors which, given their unstable status, deconstruct themselves even as they are as- serted. Consequently, "The paradigm for all texts consists of a figure (or a system of figures) and its deconstruction."8 Furthermore, he de- scribes persuasion as a derived sense of rheto- ric. Far from seeing "literariness" as the out- come of authors consciously using tropes and schemes in order to persuade and give pleasure, de Man defines it in terms of the "autonomous potential of language" and the "foregrounding of material, phenomenal aspects of the signi- fier" (Resistance, p. 10). But foregrounding requires a subject as well as an object, and if an author or reader chooses to foreground certain elements of language, or if a reader succeeds in recognizing effects manifestly intended by an author (while at the same time inevitably giving an interpretation to the words), this is no longer a matter of the autonomous potential of lan- guage. If what is foregrounded is tropes and schemes, neither their persuasive aspect nor their aesthetic effect can be bracketed. As an example of literariness, de Man dis- cusses the use of words for phonetic rather than semantic reasons (a defining instance of literari- ness since at least Jakobson's well-known essay "Linguistics and Poetics"),9 describing this, of course, as an "effect which language can per- fectly well achieve" (p. 10), rather than as an effect which language users can achieve. As had been pointed out by Jakobson himself, and by Henryk Markiewicz, the use of words for phonetic reasons is a trope, paranomasia or paranomasis. Markiewicz describes paranoma- sis as a sound-based form of metaphor in which the phonic resemblance imitates the possibility of a substitution at the level of substance (see de Man, Blindness, p. 284); but de Man insists that a particular use of paranomasis "bears no substantial relationship, by analogy or by onto- logically grounded imitation, to anything beyond</page><page sequence="4">554 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism that particular effect. It is a rhetorical rather than an aesthetic function of language ... that operates on the level of the signifier and con- tains no responsible pronouncement on the nature of the world" (Resistance, p. 10). The use of paranomasis gives language "considerable freedom from referential restraint, but it makes it epistemologically highly suspect and volatile, since its use can no longer be said to be deter- mined by considerations of truth and falsehood, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, pleasure and pain," from which de Man concludes that fore- grounding the materiality of the signifier "cre- ates a strong illusion of aesthetic seduction at the very moment when the actual aesthetic function has been, at the very least, sus- pended."'0 But this argument only holds if one accepts de Man's list of opposing pairs. If all language is inherently tropological, and the use of tropes makes language "epistemologically highly suspect and volatile," then there does indeed arise a problem concerning truth and falsehood which goes far beyond the use of paranomasis."1 But only if the claim that "beauty is truth, truth beauty" is accepted as a definition of the aesthetic do the pairs truth and falsehood, and beauty and ugliness become equivalent. If truth and beauty are not equivalent-and Keats's aphorism is clearly not all ye need to know about aesthetics-nothing prevents tropes or formalistic techniques having an aesthetic func- tion.'2 Not only paranomasis, but all the figures involving repetition and parallelism (anadiplo- sis, anaphora, antanaclasis, antimetabole, ho- moioptoton, homoioteleuton, isocolon, parison, ploche, polyptoton, and a large number of the other figures listed in any handbook of rhetoric) are often employed (usually by writers or speakers unaware that they are using a particular figure, long since named and classified), for aesthetic purposes-i.e., to please rather than to make truthful or responsible pronouncements on the nature of the world. Poets, politicians, advertis- ing copywriters, and advocates all attempt to use felicitous phrases for aesthetic effect, with- out too much concern for questions of truth. SCHILLER S AESTHETIC STATE The split between representational signification and non-representational, arbitrary signification is a recurrent theme in de Man's work, from essays such as "The Dead-End of Formalist Criticism" (1956) and "The Intentional Struc- ture of the Romantic Image" (1960), in which he first contested the notion that poetic tropes such as symbol and metaphor could capture the phenomenality of experience, to the late lec- tures on the Kantian sublime. Yet de Man is less interested in Kant's Critique of Judgement than in its reception. In "Kant's Materialism," he insists that most interpretations of Kant are based on a superficial reading, or a definite mis- reading, which makes the aesthetic appear to be frivolous, while "underestimating its powers of cognition and deep complicity with the phe- nomenalist epistemology of realism" (p. 1). He contests the genealogy that traces a line from Kant, by way of Schiller and Coleridge, to for- malism and Oscar Wilde's aestheticism, accord- ing to the false belief that in Kant the aesthetic is free from cognitive and ethical consequences. In "Kant and Schiller," he contests the "a priori valorization of art" and the "claim for the au- tonomy and power of the aesthetic" to be found in Schiller, Schopenhauer, the early Nietzsche, and Heidegger, and argues that in the reception of the Critique of Judgement, "There seems to be always a regression from the incisiveness and from the critical impact of the original" (p. 2). In particular, he contests Schiller's do- mestication of the Critique of Judgement in On the Aesthetic Education of Man, which revalor- izes the aesthetic and sets it up as an exemplary, unifying category; a model for education and for the State. De Man stresses that Schiller's formulation of the aesthetic "is primarily a social and politi- cal model .... The 'state' that is here being advocated is not just a state of mind or of soul, but a principle of political value and authority that has its own claims on the shape and the limits of our freedom" (Romanticism, p. 264). Before taking up de Man's attack on Schiller, I will summarize Schiller's notion of the aes- thetic state and the aesthetic State. Schiller describes humanity (or more pre- cisely, man) as a composite of two fundamental drives, the sense-drive and the form-drive, but suggests that a third drive, the play-drive, can unite them. The sense-drive arises from our physical, temporal existence and our sensuous nature. It gives us a thirst for change and sensa- tion, and awakens and develops our potentialities.</page><page sequence="5">MacKenzie Terrible Beauty: Paul de Man's Retreat 555 But at the same time it makes their complete fulfilment impossible, for "With indestructible chains it binds the ever-soaring spirit to the world of sense, and summons abstraction from its most unfettered excursions into the Infinite back to the limitations of the Present" (XII.3). The form- drive arises from our rational nature. It tries to bring harmony to our actions, and seeks eternal and necessary truth. It takes us out of time; where it prevails, "we experience the greatest enlarge- ment of being: all limitations disappear, and from the mere unit of quantity to which the poverty of his senses reduced him, man has raised himself to a unity of ideas embracing the whole realm of phenomena. We are no longer individuals, we are species. The judgment of all minds is ex- pressed through our own, the choice of all hearts is represented by our action" (XII.6). Schiller suggests that at first sight, these two drives seem to be diametrically opposed and irreconcilable, but this is not in fact the case: "It is true that their tendencies do indeed conflict with each other, but-and this is the point to note-not in the same objectives, and things that never make contact cannot collide" (XIII.2). Although the sensuous drive demands change, it does not extend this demand to the person and his or her principles. Although the formal drive demands unity and persistence, it demands this only of the person, but not his or her "condi- tion" and sensations. Thus to see the two drives as opposed is to mistake their nature and func- tion, and to confuse their spheres of operation. It is the task of culture, which develops our capacities for both feeling and reason, to keep the two drives within their proper frontiers. If the sensuous drive takes precedence over the formal, the world becomes a force rather than an object, and suppresses the person who ceases to exist as such. If the formal drive encroaches on the sensuous, and thought forestalls feeling, the person supplants the world, thereby becom- ing an object and ceasing to be an autonomous force and subject. Ideally, the drives give rise to and limit each other reciprocally, and come together in concert in what Schiller calls the play-drive, which attempts to reconcile becom- ing with absolute being and change with identity. Since the object of the sense-drive is life, including all material being and everything im- mediately present to the senses, and the object of the form-drive is form, in both the figurative and the literal sense, it follows that the object of the play-drive is "living form," by which Schil- ler means all the aesthetic qualities of phenom- ena, especially beauty. Beauty is form, because we contemplate it, but at the same time life, because we feel it. In the contemplation of beauty, reflection is completely interfused with feeling. Beauty, in the ideal, would be the most perfect possible union and equilibrium of reality and form, although Schiller concedes that in actuality there will always be a preponderance of the one element over the other. The best that we can hope for is an oscillation between the two principles. This is the aesthetic state, in which sense and reason are active at the same time and cancel each other out as determining forces, thereby leading sensuous man to form and thought, and bringing spiritual man back to matter and the world of sense. The aesthetic state thus favors all of our fac- ulties without distinction and is the ground of possibility of them all. Whereas truth requires that we abstract from everything material and contingent, beauty triggers free contemplation and allows us to enter the world of ideas with- out leaving behind the world of sense. The en- joyment of beauty, or aesthetic unity, therefore proves for Schiller the possibility of "sublimest humanity," in which man passes from beauty to truth ("since this latter is potentially contained in the former," (XXV.7)) and to moral freedom. "It is, therefore, one of the most important tasks of education to subject man to form even in his purely physical life, and to make him aesthetic in every domain over which beauty is capable of extending her sway, since it is only out of the aesthetic, not out of the physical, state that the moral can develop" (XXIII.6). Oddly, however, Schiller also writes that "beauty produces no particular insight what- soever, neither for the understanding nor for the will. It accomplishes no particular purpose, nei- ther intellectual nor moral; it discovers no indi- vidual truth, helps us to perform no individual duty and is, in short, as unfitted to provide a firm basis for character as to enlighten the understand- ing" (XXI.4). Which is to say that his "beauty" is a precondition for knowledge, truth, and so on, but empty-a function but not a value. Schiller is at least clear as to where beauty is to be found-in pure aesthetic form, which completely consumes material or content:</page><page sequence="6">556 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism In a truly successful work of art the contents should effect nothing, the form everything; for only through the form is the whole man affected, through the sub- ject-matter, by contrast, only one or other of his func- tions. Subject-matter, then, however sublime and all- embracing it may be, always has a limiting effect upon the spirit, and it is only from form that true aesthetic freedom can be looked for. (XXII.5) Aesthetic form is semblance, and the ideal is pure, autonomous semblance, which renounces all claims to reality: "From the moment it is dishonest, and simulates reality, or from the mo- ment it is impure, and has need of reality to make its effect, it is nothing but a base instru- ment for material ends, and affords no evidence whatsoever of any freedom of the spirit" (XXVI.11). An object in which we discover aes- thetic semblance need not be devoid of reality, but our aesthetic judgment must take no account of this reality. Since aesthetic semblance neither seeks to represent reality nor needs to be repre- sented by it, it cannot be prejudicial to either truth or morals, because it is never in danger of substituting for them-although, of course, it is also the path that leads us to them. AESTHETIC MUTILATION AND A GERMAN DESTINY Rather than mention the confusions and contra- dictions in Schiller's account of beauty, de Man attempts to show that it is potentially dangerous. In "Aesthetic Formalization," he suggests that Schiller's principles of aesthetic semblance and pure form are exemplified in the three anec- dotes that make up Kleist's short story "Uber das Marionettentheater." These concern mari- onettes that are more graceful than human dancers, men with wooden legs who can dance better than most men with their own two legs, a young man who is no longer able to reproduce the gracefulness of a statue after catching sight of himself in a mirror doing so accidentally, and a bear that is able to fence better than any man, because it is unmoved by all the feints and the artistry of a talented fencer.13 We learn that operating a marionette is sim- ply a matter of controlling its center of gravity: when this is displaced, the limbs will follow mechanically. Puppets, therefore, can be guilty of no affectation, unlike the unfortunate human dancer mentioned by Kleist's Herr C. who seems not to know his soul from his elbow. Puppets are raised by a force greater than the gravita- tional pull that draws them to the ground, whereas humans suffer from both the pull of gravity and the consciousness that results from having eaten the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, which disturbs natural human grace. Herr C. refers his interlocutor to the third chapter of the book of Genesis. (There is also a longer version by John Milton.) Kleist suggests that our fall from grace, our loss of paradise or the state of nature, can ultimately be recovered by way of art, but since, like both statues and mechan- ically-operated marionettes, men with wooden legs have more grace than unmutilated people, his story would logically seem to recommend mutilation for a dancer. This idea is all the more remarkable for the way in which it contrasts with Henri Bergson's well-known theory of comedy.14 Unlike Kle- ist's character, Bergson sees the perception of "the body taking precedence of the soul" (p. 94) as the essence of comedy rather than aesthetic grace. The artificial mechanization of the hu- man body is the primary cause of laughter: "The attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds us of a mere machine" (p. 79). The drastic price imposed by aesthetic semblance in Kleist's story seems to be a reduc- tio ad absurdum of the sort of behavior that Bergson says provokes "corrective" laughter in the rest of us. De Man, however, finds what he sees as Kleist's Schillerian logic (the implicit recommendation of a semblance of mechaniza- tion for the sake of aesthetic form) alarming rather than comic. Schiller claimed that "the most perfect of all the works to be achieved by the art of man: the construction of true political freedom" (11.1) nec- essarily passes through the aesthetic, and de Man states that our notion of politics is still rooted in Schillerian aesthetic categories. For Schiller, the problem of politics is unavoidable, because Every individual human being ... carries within him, potentially and prescriptively, an ideal man, the archetype of a human being, and it is his life's task to be, through all his changing manifestations, in har- mony with the unchanging unity of this ideal. This archetype, which is to be discerned more or less</page><page sequence="7">MacKenzie Terrible Beauty: Paul de Man's Retreat 557 clearly in every individual, is represented by the State, the objective and, as it were, canonical form in which all the diversity of individual subjects strive to unite. (IV.2) Since empirical man, existing in time, differs from ideal man, he must attempt to become the State by ennobling himself to the stature of man as Idea, given that the alternative-ideal man suppressing empirical man, and the State annu- lling individuals-is unacceptable: "a political constitution will still be very imperfect if it is able to achieve unity only by suppressing vari- ety. The State should not only respect the objec- tive and generic character in its individual sub- jects; it should also honour their subjective and specific character" (IV.3). Schiller claims that if "man is inwardly at one with himself, he will be able to preserve his individuality however much he may universalize his conduct, and the State will be merely the interpreter of his own finest instinct, a clearer formulation of his own sense of what is right" (IV.5). But for a man to be inwardly at one with himself, he must be in the aesthetic state, and thus part of an aesthetic State. Whereas the ethical State subjects the individual will to the general, "the aesthetic State ... consummates the will of the whole through the nature of the individual." Man is driven into society by his needs, and induced to behave socially by reason, but beauty alone can confer upon him a social character. Taste alone brings harmony into society, because it fosters harmony in the individual. All other forms of perception divide man, because they are founded exclusively either upon the sensuous or upon the spir- itual part of his being; only the aesthetic mode of perception makes of him a whole, because both his natures must be in harmony if he is to achieve it. (XXVII.10) Schiller makes grand claims for the aesthetic State: "No privilege, no autocracy of any kind, is tolerated where taste rules, and the realm of aesthetic semblance extends it sway. This realm stretches upward to the point where reason gov- erns with unconditioned necessity, and all that is merely matter ceases to be .... In the aesthetic State everything-even the tool which serves- is a free citizen, having equal rights with the noblest" (XXVII.11). Yet just as people require an aesthetic educa- tion in order to reach the aesthetic state as indi- viduals, the aesthetic State needs its "states- men-artists." Schiller writes that whereas neither the artisan nor the artist has any scruple in doing violence to formless matter, "With the pedagogic or political artist things are very dif- ferent indeed. For him Man is at once the mate- rial on which he works and the goal toward which he strives. ... The statesman-artist must approach his material with a quite different kind of respect from that which the maker of Beauty feigns towards his" (IV.4).15 De Man ends "Kant and Schiller" with the following quotation: Art is an expression of feeling. The artist is distin- guished from the non-artist by the fact that he has the power to give expression to what he feels. In some form or another: the one in images, a second in clay, a third in words, a fourth in marble-or even in histori- cal forms. The statesman is an artist too. For him the people is neither more nor less than what stone is for the sculptor. The leader and the led [Fiihrer und Masse] presents no more of a problem than, say, painter and colour. Politics are the plastic art of the state, just as painting is the plastic art of colour. This is why politics without the people, or even against the people, is sheer nonsense. To shape a People out of the masses, and a State out of the People, this has always been the deepest intention of politics in the true sense. This passage from Joseph Goebbels's novel Michael: A German Destiny provides de Man with a suitably dramatic ending to his lecture, but it is more soberly dealt with by Wilkinson and Willoughby in their lengthy "Introduction" to Schiller's Letters on Aesthetic Education, where they simply suggest that the State with which Goebbels was associated is not usually thought of as having represented the archetype or the canonical form of human being, which respected free, ennobled individuals, and en- joyed taste and harmony in the absence of privi- lege and autocracy (p. cxlii). De Man does not, of course, remark on the similarity of the dehumanizing metaphors (man as material, language as mechanical material, etc.) to be found in Schiller, Goebbels, and Paul de Man. He does concede that Goebbels griev- ously misreads Schiller's aesthetic State-even</page><page sequence="8">558 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism though "the principle of this misreading does not essentially differ from the misreading which Schiller inflicted on his own predecessor, namely Kant" (p. 42)-but he seems to suggest that Goebbels's misreading of Schiller alone suf- fices to condemn the very notion of aesthetic education. There is indeed a persuasive parallel between the coercive formalism of dance, and the totalitarian formalism of the Nazis' (rather than Schiller's) aesthetic State. Just as the per- formance of mechanized dance steps might be improved by mutilation, as in Kleist's tale, Goeb- bels's idea of an aesthetic State could only come into being if the Ftihrer succeeded in "mecha- nizing" the masses and shaping them into a People by repressing all signs of difference and dissent among them, a procedure that is entirely contrary to Schiller's proposals in the Letters. As Walter Benjamin pointed out in a dis- quieting conclusion to an essay on the necessity of politicizing the aesthetic,'6 the Nazis did the contrary and effected an aestheticization of pol- itics, from the mechanical formalism of the Nuremberg rallies to the ultimate horror of the "Final Solution"-the erasure from the canvas of Europe of people the Nazi leadership found aesthetically displeasing, beginning with the physically disabled (including those whom Kle- ist's Herr C. would have described as good dancers), and ending with entire races (or what de Man in 1942 had described as "extra-Euro- pean forces"). Yet rather than merely allow Goebbels's misreading of Schiller to stand in for what Schiller actually wrote (by suggesting that there is a necessary equation between aes- thetic semblance and mechanization), de Man goes on to suggest an analogy between the me- chanical figures of dance and what he sees as the mechanical and inhuman nature of lan- guage. This leads Cynthia Chase to claim that "The Kleist essay makes plain ... that the sheerly mechanical dimension of language is a violence that takes place not only at the level of individ- ual texts (such as Rousseau's autobiographies) but at the level of the state, of culture, and of politics."''7 However, the analogy between the mechanical nature of dance and the mechaniza- tion of the masses, between the individual aes- thetic state and the totalitarian aesthetic State, does not depend at all on de Man's claim that "a language that would not be definable in human terms, and that would not be accessible to the human will at all ... a language that would to some extent ... in a very radical sense not be human ... is entirely in the realm of possibility" ("Kant and Schiller," p. 38). The figurative ref- erences to "the Hitlerian soul" and to "extra- European forces" in Le Soir in 1941-2 are attributable to the young Paul de Man rather than to a sheerly mechanical dimension of lan- guage. Similarly, the decisions taken at the Wannsee Conference in 1942 that set in motion the "Final Solution" were attributable to spe- cific people with specific intentions (even if those intentions can be redescribed in aesthetic terms). Schiller's account of the role, function and nature of aesthetic education is confused and contradictory. But while its demands for aesthetic and formal purity are indeed easily recuperable and have seemed to some people to be a cause of or a justification for Nazism, it need not inevitably lead to the aesthetic State of Hitler and Goebbels. The mechanized art forms of the Nazis, such as the choreographed rallies at Nuremberg, owe little to a supposedly mech- anized language. Indeed it is hard to see the suggestion that they do as anything other than a product of the unfortunate early aesthetic edu- cation of Paul de Man. AESTHETICS AND DIALOGISM Schiller cannot be placed in de Man's category of Romantic and post-Romantic epistemologi- cal simpletons who naively ignore the disjunc- tion between aesthetic or phenomenal and cog- nitive experience. He explicitly states that his ideal of pure, autonomous semblance renounces all claims to reality. He does not suggest that particular poetic forms can capture phenomenal experience. Indeed, de Man even begins his essay on Kleist by quoting Schiller's English translators, who attribute to the author of the Letters on Aesthetic Education an awareness of "the essential tautology of all art ... its inherent tendency to offer a hundred different treatments of the same subject, to find a thousand different forms of expression for the thoughts and feel- ings common to all men" (p. cxxxi). No one who knows that there exist a thousand different forms of expression is likely to be mesmerised into believing that particular rhetorical forms have captured non-verbal reality. There is, however, an alternative theory of</page><page sequence="9">MacKenzie Terrible Beauty: Paul de Man's Retreat 559 thought and language that equally disposes of the "aesthetic ideology," but which considers human experience to be an essentially shared phenomenon, and celebrates the existence of different forms of expression. This is Mikhail Bakhtin's notion of dialogism, which conceives of both words and ideas as shared and intersub- jective entities. For Bakhtin, ideas can only live in dialogical communion between conscious- nesses, by entering into dialogical relationships with other ideas, with the voices of others. Words and ideas want to be heard, understood, and "answered" by other voices from other positions. Consequently, all utterances, includ- ing those which vainly claim uniquely to embody or express the truth, or to correspond to the structure of being, have inevitably absorbed the words and ideas of others, are responding to others, and in turn demand a dialogical re- sponse. Bakhtin insists that "dialogic relation- ships are a much broader phenomenon" than we tend to believe: indeed "they are an almost uni- versal phenomenon, permeating all human speech and all relationships and manifestations of human life-in general, everything that has meaning and significance."''8 He does not dis- pose of the notion of truth, but redefines it as requiring contact among a plurality of con- sciousnesses. A single consciousness can only seize the monologic, abstractly theoretical, finalized aspect of an idea. Living ideas are inseparable from embodied human voices: "In the mouth of another person, a word or defini- tion identical in content would take on another meaning and tone, and would no longer be the truth" (p. 55). Few people need to read de Man to realize that there is a gap between the world and words. No one who grows up in a family or in school playgrounds where more than one dialect or language collide, or indeed lives almost any- where except the proverbial remote farmstead, needs to read Bakhtin to discover the notion of heteroglossia, and its corollary, the necessary gulf between words and things. Given the wide- spread awareness of the multiplicity of dialects and speech genres, and the inevitability of con- flicting interpretations of events among as few as two people, one wonders who exactly is the naive reader who de Man believes might be beguiled by the aesthetic ideology to the extent of equating words and things, aesthetic forms and reality.'9 The exemplary candidate for such a reader would seem to be the young Paul de Man, who, in 1941-2, wrote that each nation has a spirit or a soul or a dominating artistic form or tendency, which belongs to the whole people rather than to individual imaginations, and that the very definition of a nation is that it has a characteristic art (rather than a culture, which must necessarily include extra-national ele- ments), arising out of the personality of an en- tire people. Thus "A sincere artist can never renounce his proper regional [character], des- tined by blood and soil, since it is an integrating part of his essence, which he has to utter." De Man repeatedly expressed a preference for German to French literature, largely because whereas German writers attempt to use "the subtle connections that exist between the indi- vidual and the community as mainsprings for novelistic fiction," in French writing, "man is being considered and analyzed only as an iso- lated individual." Yet even nations such as Ger- many, with what de Man called inexhaustible artistic wealth, could also take over, adapt and enrich the forms of neighboring countries; indeed "renovation usually occurs through the assimilation of foreign norms which are trans- formed and reduced to a number of specific and constant values, the own spiritual property of the nation." Where such values are ignored, "one can legitimately speak of degeneration." In Germany, the culprits were "specifically Jews."20 Those of us who have never believed that particular poetic forms express a nation's soul or destiny (and who have never disguised anti-Semitic and Nazi arguments as aesthetic ones) have little reason to claim that tropes have no aesthetic function, that an aesthetic educa- tion need lead to totalitarianism, or that lan- guage is mechanical and inhuman.

It is, of course, entirely possible to mouth utterances in foreign languages without understanding them. In the bad old days, students spent hours in language laboratories doing rep- etition and substitution drills, not infrequently without know- ing what they were saying, or why. What is known as com- municative language teaching is precisely a reaction against the manipulation of literally meaningless sentences. 6.

In "Reading and History," de Man also attempts to empty of aesthetic content the historical concretizations described by Hans-Robert Jauss in terms of readers' "hori- zons of expectation." Although Jauss's historical concepts "seem to dovetail perfectly" with the structural aesthetics of the Prague circle, and "this theoretical alliance achieves a genuine synthesis between hermeneutics and poetics" (p. 63), de Man questions whether the concretizations of lit- erary works described by Jauss, like the concretizations described by the formalists, are part of an aesthetic process. In particular, he rejects Jauss's description of resistances and linguistic difficulties thrown up by close reading as aesthetic devices. 11. The contrary of tropes such as paranomasis and meta- phor might seem to be mimesis, in which language does not enjoy considerable freedom from referential restraint, and where there surely is the possibility of considering truth and falsehood, good and evil, and so on. But de Man describes mimesis as merely "one trope among others, language choos- ing to imitate a non-verbal entity just as paranomasis 'imi- tates' a sound without any claim to identity (or reflection of difference) between the verbal and non-verbal elements" (p. 10), a state of affairs which "frees the discourse of literature from naive oppositions between fiction and reality." 12. At the beginning of "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," de Man describes "Keats's 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty"' as but one instance of the "gesture that links epistemology with rhetoric" which "recurs in many philo- sophical and poetic texts of the nineteenth century," includ- ing Nietzsche's On Truth and Lie (Romanticism, p. 239). Here he only quotes the beginning of Nietzsche's descrip- tion of truth as "a moving army of metaphors, metonymies and anthropomorphisms," although in Allegories of Read- ing he translates the complete sentence, which ends "... that are being poetically and rhetorically sublimated, transposed, and beautified" (p. 110). Which is to say that Nietzsche links epistemology, rhetoric, and aesthetics, while Keats's aphor- ism is more concerned with aesthetics than rhetoric. De Man writes in the same paragraph that "the continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment ... is the main tenet and the major crux of all critical philosophies and 'Romantic' litera- tures," but his dislike for this "philosophical phantasm" (Romanticism, p. 258), leads him to a far too hasty claim that rhetoric contains no aesthetic component. 13.

Adrian Stokes made a suggestive distinction between "carvers" who respect their raw material and "modellers" who do not, and related this to Melanie Klein's psychoanalytic theory of whole- and part-object relations. Stokes' distinction might also be extended to apply to readers of literature: see my "Theories of Reading: Carvers and Modellers," American Imago 44:4 (Fall 1987): 535-44. 16.
