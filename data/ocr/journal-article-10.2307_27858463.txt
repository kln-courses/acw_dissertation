<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL COGNITION The Great Divide Do Animals Think? Clive D. L. Wynne, viii + 268 pp. Princeton University Press, 2004. $26.95. Do animals think? Well, surely some do, you may think. And an in creasing number of researchers across disdplines would agree with you: They are trying to determine how?not whether?animals consciously process information about their social and nonsocial environments. What is going on in the minds of an imals? Do they have desires and be liefs? Zealots abound at both ends of a spectrum that ranges from those who believe that animals are merely thoughtless robotic automatons to those who argue that all are thinking creatures with rich cognitive lives. I imagine that the truth lies somewhere in the middle: A number of animals have the capacity for thinking about certain situations and showing flexible, adaptable behavior, whereas others may behave reflexively, with little or no thought at all. Psychologist Clive D. L. Wynne takes a firm behaviorist stance on the issue in his new book, Do Animals Think? He argues that animals, even those commonly believed to have ac tive minds and a good deal of con scious thought?companion animals, dolphins and great apes?really don't think much about anything. Here, and also in a brief communication and an essay published in the March 11 and April 8 issues of Nature, Wynne says that we should be very cautious about ascribing consciousness to animals and that anthropomorphic explanations have no place in the study of animal behavior. I should confess right away that I'm a member of the opposing camp?a rich cognitivist. Thus I was skeptical of Wynne's position from the outset. But I was also open to his arguments. And I did find some of the information he presents about bees, bats and other ani mals to be both fascinating and thought provoking. Unfortunately, Wynne's adversar ial tone and narrow choice of data made this book a difficult read for me. Throughout he takes potshots at well-known scientists, philosophers and advocates of animal protection: Roger Fouts especially, and also the late Donald Griffin, Sue Savage Rumbaugh, Frans de Waal, Jane Good all, Peter Singer, Steven Wise and even Linda McCartney. Wynne criti cizes them for using questionable in formation about animal sentience to support the view that we should be deeply concerned with animal well being. The book opens with an ac count of violence against humans by a member of the Animal Liberation Front, and it ends on a similar note, with Wynne criticizing animal protec tionists for flawed thinking. He claims that he longs for the certainty of those who attribute consciousness and the ability to experience pain to many an imals. But in fact, he advocates the opposite point of view with that same level of certainty. Although Wynne admits that we do not know very much about animal thinking, this does not stop him from arguing that his reductionist views are correct. He believes that the differences between animals and humans are greater, and more significant, than the similarities. But are they?

From Do Animals Think? species in his arguments for mental dissimilarity? He claims that The psychological abilities that make human colture possible?en thusiasm to imitate others, lan guage, and the ability to place one self imaginatively into another's perspective on events?are almost entirely lacking in any other species. What does "almost" mean? Nobody claims that other animals are identical to us, but arguments invoking evolu tionary continuity leave room for the conclusion that the differences are, in fact, small?differences in degree rather than differences in kind. Many observations show that members of some species imitate other animals, empathize with them, are able to take another's perspective in certain situa tions (there is neurobiological evidence to support the conclusion that some animals have a theory of mind), and have culture and rather sophisticated patterns of communication. The behaviorist view is little con cerned with evolution. It also fails to recognize that the behavior of many animals is far too flexible and situation specific to be explained in terms of simplified stimulus-response contin gencies. Marked within-species vari ability is quite common, and this adap tive variability often (although not always) lends itself readily to "cogni tive" explanations invoking conscious ness, intentions and beliefs. It remains to be shown how large the differences are between humans and oth er animals. Although Wynne claims to recognize that not enough data are avail able to make definitive statements, he offers them nonetheless, arriving at some sweeping generalizations. He argues for the objective study of behavior, but? ironically?much of his book serves to il lustrate that science isn't value-free and that every scientist has an agenda. Scientists who are skeptical about research on animal thinking typically criticize it for being anecdotal and an thropomorphic. They claim that anec dotes don't provide sufficient data (a view with which I and other rich cogni tivists generally agree) and that anthro pomorphic explanations are extremely imprecise. Wynne favors reductionistic stimulus-response explanations over ones that appeal to such notions as con sciousness, intentions and beliefs. How ever, he doesn't offer any scientific sup port for his position. And in fact there is no empirical evidence that the explana tions he favors are better for under standing and predicting behavior than those he eschews. Many who, like Wynne, favor mecha nistic explanations have not spent much time watching free-ranging animals. Were they to do so, the complexity and flexibility of animal behavior would force them to realize that no simple ex planatory scheme will be correct all of the time. What is more, they would ap preciate better how much more there still is to learn about animal behavior. Almost daily, surprising new find ings crop up: New Caledonian crows are better at making and using tools than many primates; fish show culture and likely feel pain; a dog named Rico knows about 200 words and can figure out, through exclusion learning, that an unfamiliar sound refers to an un familiar toy. So it's best to keep an open mind. The fact that an animal doesn't do something in one context doesn't necessarily mean that it won't be able to do it in another. Rehirning at the end of the book to the theme of his opening pages, Wynne expresses heavy skepticism about whether animals feel pain and whether that should influence how we treat them. On the one hand, he praises philosopher Jeremy Bentham's claim that the key question for deterrnining the moral and legal standing of animals is "Can they suffer?"?not "Can they reason?" or "Can they talk?" But on the other hand, Wynne notes that even if we could measure pain in ardmals, "it is still not clear that this would tell us what to do and to whom." Feeling pain is not, in his view, the only criterion for deciding whether animals are worthy of our concern. He says, revealingly, that animals "are valuable to us because of who we are, not what they are." Urtfortunately, a great divide remains between opposing camps. The polemi cal tone and lack of balance in the book make it difficult for me to recommend it as a text for a course unless it's read alongside a book that presents a variety of views on animal thinking. And incon sistencies in the argumentation make it hard for me to recommend it for a gen eral audience. I do think that the book will serve to stimulate discussion of such issues as what it means to "know" something, how much information must be available before we can draw reliable, sweeping conclusions, and how we de termine how certain we can be that those conclusions are correct. Studies of animal tliinking lend themselves nicely to that philosophical exercise.?Marc Belooff, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder</page></plain_text>
