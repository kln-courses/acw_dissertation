(Pp 361; ?12-50.) Faber and Faber. 1977. George Saintsbury, who appreciated good poetry and fine wine, wrote in 1914 of Erasmus Darwin: "Time is not likely to destroy and may rather increase, the credit due to Darwin's scientific pioneership: its whirligig is never likely to restore the faintest genuine taste for his pseudo-poetry."' This was a brave scientific forecast for a literary critic to make, for Charles Darwin had written in his autobiography: "I had previously read the Zoonomia of my grandfather, in which similar views (to those of Lamarck) are maintained, but without producing any effect on me. On reading it a second time after an interval of 10 or 15 years, I was much disappointed, the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts given." In a short 45 years the whirligig was to bring Erasmus more scientific credit than his grandson had given him. C D Darling ton in his book Darwin's Place in History gave Erasmus an approving chapter headed "The Great Precursor."2 There can be no dispute about poetic taste but in the decade before Saints bury's article was written German studies of Darwin's poetry had appeared, and in 1936 J V Logan published an admirable Princeton dissertation on The Poetry and Aesthetics of Erasmus Darwin.' In 1973 facsimile reprints of The Botanic Garden and The Temple of Nature appeared. Despite Saintsbury's prognosis, Erasmus Darwin had reached the foothills of Parnassus. Restoring a reputation Desmond King-Hele in this widely and scrupulously re searched biography, Doctor of Revolution, carries the restoration of his reputation to exalted limits when he claims that Erasmus was "the greatest Englishman of the eighteenth century." King-Hele lists in alphabetical order 75 subjects in which Erasmus was a pioneer (in one or more of five defined ways), from the "abolition of slavery" to "women's lib." The reputa tion of Erasmus, therefore, depends on his distinction in widely diverse activities. If this list is critically examined, we find that his prophecy in some cases is more prominent than the perfor mance, speculation more common than the establishment of fact, and opinion more evident than proof. Although I am ready to accept the King-Hele assurances for such items in the list as adiabatic expansion, aurorae, electrochemistry, ideal gas law, night airglow, outer atmosphere, and rocket motors, I should like to have heard Erasmus on biological pest control, nerve impulses, exercise for children (he deliberately avoided it for himself), organic happiness, the treatment of dropsy, and water closets which flushed automatically when the door was closed. King-Hele scores a win when he writes that Erasmus was more knowledgeable than his grandson on the subject of seed travel. Charles tentatively concluded that seeds might travel hundreds of miles, but Erasmus knew that cassia seeds carried by the sea from America to Norway were still capable of germination: "Soft breathes the gale, the current gently moves, And bears to Norway's coasts her infant-loves." Charles's copy of The Botanic Garden is heavily marked, but his grandfather's information on seed travel went unnoticed. King-Hele's qualifications for making an authoritative assess ment of Erasmus Darwin cannot be questioned. He has been interested in him for many years and in 1963 and 1968 published two books about him.4 He is FRS, an expert in space research, and in 1971 he published a book Shelley: His Thought and Work. The claims he puts forward on behalf of Erasmus concern his achievement as physician, inventor, evolutionist, botanist, and poet. He practised as a physician in Lichfield from 1756 to 1781, and in Derby from 1783 until his death in 1802. King-Hele writes that Erasmus was "widely acclaimed as the finest doctor of his time in England." This is a statement that can be neither proved nor tested, although it is true that his physicianly reputa tion came to the knowledge of George III. He has no place in the history of medicine and he would be unremembered there if he had not quarrelled with William Withering, who, although a difficult colleague, was a more distinguished physician than Darwin. The professional standards of the day were very differ ent from ours. Both men acted unethically in their disputes, but Erasmus's conduct can be excused only by his anxiety for the reputation of his sons-one dead, and the other seeking to establish his practice in Shrewsbury. The case for Erasmus as an inventor is not in doubt. He had a fertile and ingenious mind and was enthusiastic in assisting the mechanical advances introduced by fellow-members of the Lunar Society. He differed from the perverse Dr Johnson, who favourably contrasted the citizens of Lichfield with those of Birmingham: "Sir, we are a city of philosophers, we work with our heads, and we make the boobies of Birmingham work for us with their hands." Men such as Matthew Boulton, Josiah Wedgwood, James Watt, Edgeworth, and James Keir were then determining our industrial future for good and evil, and Erasmus was a notable catalyst in this ingenious company. Scores of the ideas roughly sketched in his commonplace book did not reach the drawing board and few were put into active use, but his mechanical ability was sufficiently demonstrated by those that were developed-the horizontal windmill employed by Wedgwood for grinding colours, the speaking machine, the wire-drawn river ferry, and the "artesian well" pipe, both in use in his Derby garden. Lover of plants and friends Erasmus was an enthusiastic and erudite botanist. In the 1780s he occupied his leisure by translating Linnaeus's System of Vegetables and Families of Plants. These are vast and scholarly works, their four volumes running to nearly 2000 pages. In 1789 he published The Loves of the Plants, a poetic version of Linnean botany, "to enlist Imagination under the banner of Science." The poem had an extraordinary success. The idea of vegetable sex was novel, and Darwin's 968 rhymed couplets were engaging: "What Beaux and Beauties crowd the gaudy groves And woo and win their vegetable loves." He pictured the anthropomorphic plants as happily sharing the sexual desires of men and women. The lychnis, for example, in which the male and female elements are on different plants, "In gay undress displays her rival charms, And calls her wandering lovers to her arms."</page><page sequence="2">BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 11 FEBRUARY 1978 355 The Economy of Vegetation published in 1781, together with The Loves of the Plants, completed The Botanic Garden. William Cowper described the poem as "strong, learned, and sweet," while Horace Walpole was overwhelmed with its beauties "charming, enchanting, gorgeous, beautiful, sublime." Coleridge and Wordsworth were early admirers, though they later regarded its influence as "injurious." In 1794 and 1798 two clever paro dies of the poem appeared, The Golden Age and The Loves of the Triangles, which some literary critics have thought more skilful and entertaining than the original. Erasmus was an indefatigable writer and, despite more than a million words of published poetry and prose, he found time to write frequent letters to his friends. He was an affectionate and compassionate man who kept his friendships "in constant repair." He wrote to James Watt who was suffering from depression: "Why will you not live at Derby? I want learning from you of all kinds. and would give you in exchange chearfulness which by some parts of your letter you seem to want and of which I have generally a steady supply. Why the d --- 1 do you talk of your mental faculties decaying, when you have more mechani cal invention, accuracy, and execution than any other person alive ?-besides an inexhaustible fund of wit, when you please to call for it ?" He loved his family and delighted in the company of women, as Charles Darwin observed. Sexual love was for him"the purest source of human felicity, the cordial drop in the otherwise vapid cup of life." Two of his children were illegitimate, borne by the amiable Miss Parker of Lichfield, and it was characteristic of his humanitarian spirit that these two daughters were brought up in the happy family home. King-Hele has a revealing sentence towards the end of his book defending his attitude to Charles (voyager, scientist scientist, anchorite), which is well on the dispassionate side of idolatry; "I should like to make it clear that I have the highest admiration for Charles, and believe his fame to be well deserved." Substitute "Erasmus" for "Charles" in this sentence, and you have my opinion of the brilliant cavalier whom King-Hele names Doctor of Revolution.
