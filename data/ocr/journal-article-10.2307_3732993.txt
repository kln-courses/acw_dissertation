This book has been long-awaited and much-needed. Now it is published, it is no disappointment. Would that the author had been able to deal with a longer period - but her choice of thoroughness instead of chronological spread is amply justified by the result. The book starts with a coup d'aeil at the privilege system as it developed across Europe, but quickly settles into a systematic analysis of all the aspects of the development and use of privileges in France until 1526, with chapters concerning the privilege-granting authorities, the legal procedures involved, the grounds on which privileges were granted, the dating and duration of privileges (in this period usually two or three years, with variations depending on the granting authority), the display and advertising of privileges, a subject analysis of the books protected (especially interesting), the ownership and transfer of privileges, and their enforce- ment and efficacy. Elizabeth Armstrong concludes that within twenty years the majority of books being printed for the first time were covered by privileges. Authors and publishers were prepared to invest not inconsiderable sums on fees in the expectation of a worthwhile return; later in the century the dwindling supply of unpublished literature placed a new emphasis on the authors of new literature as printers sought material to publish. Armstrong has examined thousands of books in pursuit of the basic knowledge which underpins this work, and further applied her profound knowledge of the literature of the sixteenth century. The result is far richer than a mere listing of the privileges she has unearthed. But for good measure there is a Register of some 400 privileges, divided usefully according to the authority by which they were granted (Royal Chancery; Parlements and other Sovereign Courts; Royal Officers; authority not known), presented in exemplary form. We must hope that the thousands of other privileges which Armstrong has recorded can somehow eventually be listed, and the lists published and analysed. The present work indicates just how valuable that information would be. UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW STEPHEN RAWLES The Dissident Montaigne. By MAX GAUNA. (American University Studies, 2: Romance Languages and Literature, 118) New York, Bern, Frankfurt a.M, and Paris: Lang. I989. xiv + 303 pp. ?31. This is an interesting but, in some ways, infuriating study: interesting because of the scholarly and pertinent points it raises, infuriating because of the pedestrian method employed. Max Gauna has set out to 'examine the credentials of the case to be made for considering the Essais as containing upwellings of that great countercurrent of dissidence which flows under the surface of religious conformity' (p. I). In pains- taking fashion he has gone through the Essais, chapter by chapter, page by page, and often line by line, commenting upon the significance of Montaigne's remarks about religion. He has forestalled eventual criticism to a certain extent by admitting that the Essais may say things which Montaigne may not have understood as such, or contradictory things in different contexts and with differing intentions (p. 3). He contrasts his own interpretation of Montaigne's words with that of previous readers such as Sclafert, Dreano, Smith, and Screech, especially the latter, often harshly. His conclusion is one which many of us could accept: that Montaigne had a healthy sceptical attitude towards religious tenets and that he had an 'inability to come to terms either intellectually or emotionally with anthropomorphic conceptions of the</page><page sequence="2">deity, all this co-existing often uneasily with emotional attachment, equally genuine and allowing suspension of disbelief, to the customs and rituals of the creed of his fathers: conviction that the maintenance of such customs and rituals is necessary for the internal discipline, identity and integrity of the State' (p. 283). Gauna may have shown us the seed of dissidence within the Essais which could be cultivated by others into a tree of dissent - the readers of the seventeenth century did not fail to do so - but I am not convinced that Montaigne's attitude was very different from that of any intelligent Catholic who preferred to steer clear of metaphysical argument. I found it hard work reading the commentary as such, for it needs constant reference to the text of the Essais and to the wider context of each chapter. Such hard work often yielded a satisfying reward and Gauna certainly provides valuable insights into the text and matter for discussion. UNIVERSITY OF EXETER KEITH CAMERON Moliere: 'Les Femmes savantes'. By NOEL PEACOCK. (Critical Guides to French Texts, 78) London: Grant &amp; Cutler. 1990. 89 pp. ?3.95. Taking as his starting-point Moliere's remark that 'les pieces ne sont faites que pour etrejouees', Noel Peacock considers Les Femmes savantes from the comic and dramatic angle. As he rightly comments, the more intellectual, literary, or social aspects have previously been studied exhaustively (he includes a useful bibliography). Peacock's technique is to discuss the broad outlines of selected aspects of the text as theatre, and then to illustrate them by detailed discussion of one or two specific points. He starts with plot, concentrating on how Moliere introduces his main themes in the exposition and on how he builds up suspense throughout the play. The chapter on comic structure, based on an incongruity theory of comedy, features an interest- ing discussion of comic entrances and exits: do characters appear opportunely or at awkward moments, and to what effect? The most substantial chapter is on comic language - appropriately enough, since for the femmes savantes 'language acquires the status of a religion'. Peacock makes some subtle points here. He quotes Vaugelas to demonstrate that despite their pretensions the femmes savantes have misunderstood the grammarian's principles. He examines Martine's speech, and shows that she is capable of sophisticated turns of phrase, and makes far more mistakes when addressing the femmes savantes than at other times: perhaps she is exaggerating her clumsiness with words to tease her mistresses. He contrasts the different groups of characters, the precieuses, the professionals, the conservatives, and the 'linguistic norm' (Henriette and Clitandre), and shows how the characters' use of language helps us to situate them in these groups. In the chapter on ideas, he touches briefly on the feminist (or anti-feminist) implications, and selects erudition versus ignor- ance as the main theme of the play. The remaining chapters, on social climbing and marriage, satire and literary sources, the unities, and the denouement, are much more sketchy. This seems reasonable, as these topics have been analysed by earlier critics. Less under- standable, in view of Peacock's theatrical interest, is the fact that he scarcely mentions challenging recent productions of the play (Ranjit Bolt's 1987 modern- dress adaptation, The Sisterhood, for instance, turns it into a farce on feminism). Peacock concludes that the play is a coherent, carefully structured, and balanced work. Overall, indeed, this study brings out the play's patterns and symmetry on many levels: between the different characters, between scenes, between characters' use of language. Moliere, it appears, aims for precision in every aspect of his play. Peacock's own writing is precise and clear. Though he makes no attempt at comprehensive coverage of the text, his detailed approach is highly rewarding, and Reviews 748</page></plain_text>
