As Chino Kaori has argued, this type of representation has been gendered as feminine, and was traditionally appre- ciated and understood within the domain of wa or "native" imagery.1 In other words, in shrine mandalas, the concepts of both wa and femininity were applied to kami deities. On the other hand, the appearance of Bud- dhist deities, who were represented in an iconic and anthropomorphic manner, was abstract and refined. In this sense, their depiction can be contrasted with that of the kami deities and situated, in opposition, as masculine and Chinese. These elegant, "mascu- line" Buddhist deities appear in the upper register of the shrine mandala and are placed in a high posi- tion both in the two- and three-dimensional sense, transcending nature and implicitly governing the kami. The kami, who bear the burden of feminin- ity, can be understood as taking on the function of a ground or stage- a mother earth who receives the Buddhist deities that have flown in from foreign lands. Within this scene, subtle and detailed motifs have been scattered throughout, adding a sense of purity and innocence to this sacred site of the shrine precinct. Furthermore, seasonal motifs convey a sense of cyclicality, emphasizing both its univer- sality and eternality. What is important here is the logic of the double image. On one hand, the shrine precinct, which is an embodiment of the kami , is transformed by the presence of Buddhas and bodhisattvas from a mere topographical view to a religiously charged site, and one must read the landscape as having as much "iconicity" as the Buddhist figures. On the other hand, the omniscient and ever-present aspects of the Buddhist deities, who transcend the topographical scheme of the landscape, are secured by virtue of their placement in the upper register of the shrine mandala.
