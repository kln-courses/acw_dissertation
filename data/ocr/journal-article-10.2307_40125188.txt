<plain_text><page sequence="1">Noted Marin Franicevic. Pod istim suncem. Zagreb. Naprijed. 1969. 175 pages. The main theme of Franicevic' book of poetry Pod istim suncem (Under the Same Sun) is man in nature and his closeness to it. Man is in search of his identity and lost relationship to nature. Things in nature are presented through anthropomorphism, but it is the essence of things, not their appearance, that interests the poet. Through that he arrives at the essence of nature and man. Thus nature and man are parts of one and the same phenomenon. The fact that sadness and hopelessness increase with every new poem and that the only human being appearing in the poems is the observer (as though the author speaks for all) underscores the solitary, contemplative, and pessimistic attitude of the poet. Franic'evic* (b. 1911), a member of the older genera- tion of Croatian writers, is also known as a literary historian and theoretician and a poet in his native dialect, Chakavian. He is an unassuming poet whose reputation, despite numerous collections, has been assured only lately. After these impressionistic and imagist poems about the two main sources of his poetry - the islands of his native sea and childhood - Franicevic cannot be overlooked as one of the best living Croatian poets.
