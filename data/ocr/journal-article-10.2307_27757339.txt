I am indebted to Russell McCormmach for invaluable criticisms and stimulating comments and to the National Science Foundation for support of my research in Japan. I want to make some remarks here on Japanese names. The normal order is family name first, then given name: ARAI Hakuseki. Reference to a person by a single name rather than by his full name, however, follows two rules: in pre-modern times, that is, pre-1868, persons are referred to by their given or chosen names, which often served as their pen names (ARAI Hakuseki would be referred to as Hakuseki); in modern times, that is, post-1868, a person is known by his family name (YUKAWA Hideki would be referred to as Yukawa). In accordance with Western scholarly convention, I have retained these practices. However, in order to avoid confusion in the notes where both Japanese and Western authors are listed, I have adopted a uniform convention: initial of the given name followed by the family name (H. Yukawa, D. Price). Also in accordance with Western scholarly usage I have employed the Hepburn system for the Romanization of all Japanese names and words. Not all Japanese use this system: Hiroshige Tetsu, for ex ample, prefers Hirosige Tetu for his own name and may be found under that Romani zation in some publications elsewhere. 3</page><page sequence="3">4 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Foreign Teachers 33 Mendenhall and Ewing 35 The Faculty of Science and the Development of Physics 37 The Tokyo School of Physics 39 The Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society 44 4.

In the face of domestic crisis and international tension Japan decided to transform itself into a great power under the slogan Fukoku kyohei, or "wealth and military strength for Japan." Internal factors that brought about the de cision were the feudal government's failure to resolve the problem of agrarian uprisings and a general deterioration in government control over domestic affairs. The external factor was pressure from the West for open</page><page sequence="4">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 5 trade. Japan had been closed under a rigidly enforced isolation policy for bidding contact with the outside world for more than two hundred years; in the face of new and increasing Western threats, the government's waver ing attitude underlined its weakness. Although the pressure exerted by the West on Japan was considerably less than that directed toward China, Japan reacted intensely to it.2 When China, a country long the object of Japan's admiration, was defeated by powerful British forces in the Opium War of 1840, Japan sensed that it, too, might at any moment suffer de feat.3 The psychological factor of fear inspired by the Opium War oper ated alongside a cultural factor in determining the nature of Japan's re sponse to external pressure. Under the feudal system in Japan relations between people were understood only as vertical; that is, as relations be tween superiors and inferiors or between governors and the governed. Thus, the feudal rulers were not able to conceive of any relationship with Western nations other than one in which Japan would be either dominant or dominated.4 Feudal Japanese society of the 1850's consisted of about 265 han or fiefs. Each fief was controlled by a daimyd or feudal lord, who in turn owed allegiance to the shogunate or military government headed by the Tokugawa family, members of which had successively controlled the country since 1600. Above this structure was the Emperor, who had no political power, but whose prestige as a symbol of Japan and of its history had to be recognized even by the Tokugawa shogunate. Although the con stituents of this complex polity differed in their reactions to the threat from the West, their initial response to the first Western overture was one of almost total unanimity against opening the country and establishing trade. In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry came to Japan from the United States with modern firearms and steam-powered warships, symbols of the powerful West, demanding that Japan open ports for American whaling ships and set up machinery for trade; in the years that followed, Japanese reactions changed quickly as direct contacts with the West increased. De 2The difference between the external pressure on Japan and that on other Asian countries was directly related to Japan's position as the last Asian country to be ap proached by Western powers. Having experienced considerable troubles in dealing with Oriental countries (in China, with the Opium War in 1840 and the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850's; in India, with the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857), the Western na tions assumed threatening postures but wished to avoid open military conflict with Japan. See S. Nohara, "Kyokuto o meguru kokusai kankei," in Nihon rekishi?Kindai (Tokyo, 1962), 1, 59-96. 3C. Blacker, The Japanese Enlightenment (Cambridge, 1964), p. 16. 4S. TOyama, Mei/7 ishin (Tokyo, 1951), pp. 73-7'4.</page><page sequence="5">6 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS clining opposition to opening Japan to the West was particularly con spicuous among the feudal lords and their followers. It was found even among those who had previously been the strongest advocates of isolation ism, as in such places as the Satsuma and Ch?sh? fiefs. Satsuma had been bombarded by the British fleet in 1863 in retaliation for so-called "terror ism" (the Richardson killing), and a year later Chosh? had been fired upon by an allied fleet of British, American, Dutch, and French ships in retalia tion for having fired at their ships. Such incidents convinced the Japanese, including the most stubbornly anti-Western, of the technological superior ity of "Western civilization" and of the need to open the country and ob tain the fruits of this civilization to survive.5 The changes initiated during the early stages of contact with the West led to the abolition of the closed-country policy, the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the establishment of a strong, new, centralized government headed by Emperor Meiji, to whom ultimate power and authority was restored in 1868. The new government abolished the feudal domains and the vertical class system of samurai, peasant, artisan, and merchant. It established a new taxation system and imposed other far reaching reforms. The path Japan took in achieving the Meiji Restoration is very complex and cannot be considered in the present study. It is im portant to note, however, that although Japan was awakened by the West and its revolutionary reforms were to a large extent based upon Western ideas, it did not seek to become a Western nation. Rather, Japan sought to become a nation capable of coping with external encroachments and of competing with the West, a nation of people who could be proud of them selves before Western people. Their nationalistic attitude was not explicit, however, but latent in the early years of the Meiji period, when they tended to disparage themselves before Westerners and to absorb everything Western. The word "nationalistic" is somewhat inappropriate at this stage, for the attitudes formed under the feudal system and during Japan's long period of isolation hardly resembled modern nationalism. Geographically isolated from the rest of Asia, Japan had evolved its own unique forms of government, language, religion, and culture. It was aware of its own in dividuality, but, as one Japanese intellectual wrote in 1875, it was not yet a nation.6 By the time of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905, however, Japan had risen from feudal obscurity to one of the five most powerful nations in the world and had acquired modern nationalistic attitudes.

At times the de velopment of science meant to the Japanese the development, even the survival, of the nation; at times words such as "physics" meant "science" and "science" meant "civilization." In the present study I will explore the complex phenomenon of the introduction of Western science into Japan through an examination of the history of Japanese physics. I do so not be cause I believe that the process observable in Japan will provide a model of success for other non-Western nations, but, on the contrary, to show among other things that it cannot be duplicated. 2. JAPAN'S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH WESTERN SCIENCE The Beginnings of Rangaku (Dutch Learning) In 1543 a Portuguese ship ran aground at Tanegashima, bringing the Japanese into direct contact with Europeans for the first time. From that introduction until the 1630's Western knowledge, limited primarily to astronomy (Ptolemaic theory), medicine, and navigation, entered Japan under Christian influence, mainly through the Jesuits. Western knowledge during this period was known as Nambangaku or "southern barbarian studies," a term appropriated from the Chinese, who used it to refer to the learning of the West borne to the East by the "uncivilized" Europeans on ships from the south. The Japanese showed considerable interest in the teachings of the Christian priests on the earth's configuration, falling stars, and other astronomical subjects and inquired about other natural phe nomena such as lightning, rain, and snow.7 By 1639, however, the Japanese government, suspicious of the political implications of aggressive Christian proselytizing, adopted its national iso lation policy. The only Europeans permitted to remain and to continue trade were the Dutch, and even they were restricted to a small island near Nagasaki called Dejima.8 During this sakoku, or closed-country, period from 1639 to 1853 the Dutch became Japan's main source of European knowledge. Rangaku, or Dutch learning, became the new term for Western knowledge; it consisted of the study of Western natural science?mostly medicine, astronomy, and botany?through the Dutch language. It is im portant to note that, aside from language study, Rangaku did not include the humanities. 7A. Ebizawa,NambangakuW no kenky? (Tokyo, 1959), pp. 41-42. 81639 is the date when Japan's isolation was more or less completed. The first iso lation order was issued in 1633 and was reissued every year until 1639. For a discus sion of the isolation policy in Japan, see E. Reischauer and J. Fairbank, East Asia: The Great Tradition (Boston, 1960), pp. 595-601.</page><page sequence="7">8 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Western knowledge in Japan?Nambangaku and Rangaku?was not ex tensive; Western and Japanese cultures were too different and met on too limited a basis for fundamental changes or profound mutual influence to occur during the early stages of contact. The Japanese were most attracted to the practical sciences?astronomy, medicine, and navigation?with which they could immediately improve their lives. Until the end of the seventeenth century Rangaku developed very slowly due to several factors. The confinement of the Dutch on Dejima severely limited their contact with the Japanese; Japanese interpreters lacked a sound knowledge of the Dutch language;9 and Japanese authorities pro hibited the importation of all Western books as well as their Chinese trans lations. The purpose of the book ban was to ensure that no works dealing with Christianity entered the country, but of course books on science such as the Chinese translation of Euclid's Elements10 were equally victims of the sweeping proscription. The rare contacts between the Japanese and the Dutch were provided by official liaison agents, suppliers, and inter preters for the Dutch, by Dutch visitors to the shogun in Edo (present-day Tokyo), and by a few Dutch medical and military tutors. A Dutch physi cian, Caspar Schambergen, became the unwitting founder of a type of medicine known in Japan as the Caspar School, and a Dutch gunner, Schaedel, taught the use of artillery to Japanese in Edo;11 in general the knowledge transmitted during this early period was of such a fragmentary nature that an adequate picture of Rangaku cannot be clearly presented. It was not until the late eighteenth century that the Japanese undertook systematic studies of Rangaku. In the early eighteenth century Dutch learning attracted the interest of a number of important Japanese who influenced the direction of its develop ment. Arai Hakuseki, a Confucian scholar and counselor to the shogunate from 1709 to 1716, interviewed an Italian Jesuit, G. B. Sidotti, who in 1708 had illegally smuggled himself into Japan to engage in missionary work and was captured and brought to Edo. Following their interview, 9Portuguese had been more popular than Dutch up to this time as a result of the more than one hundred years of trade between Japan and Portugal. A record written by a Dutch official in 1675 comments on the lack of efficiency in trade because of the poor knowledge of Japanese on the part of Dutch interpreters. See J. Numata, Yogaku denrai no rekishi (Tokyo, 1966), pp. 6-10. 10T. Itazawa, Nichiran bunka kosh?shi no kenky? (Tokyo, 1959), p. 456. These Western scientific books were prohibited nofbecause of their subject matter, but be cause they had been translated by Christians. 11 J. Numata, Yogaku denrai no rekishi, pp. 14-16.</page><page sequence="8">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 9 Hakuseki wrote two books, Sairan igen (A Selected View of Foreign Statements) in 1708, and Seiyo kibun (Report of the Occident) in 1713, in which he reported that Sidotti displayed an extensive knowledge of astronomy and world geography. "The man was very learned, and ap peared to have studied many subjects. I do not think that we can compete with them [Westerners] as far as the fields of astronomy and geography are concerned."12 He then modified his praise of the West by saying that Western knowledge was very accurate only in the practical sciences. He also criticized the current shogunate view of the dangerous, aggressive character of Christianity. Through his position as counselor to two sho guns, through his recognition of the value of Rangaku and the superiority of Western practical sciences, and through his insistence on the separation of Western science from Christianity, Hakuseki opened the way to the further development of Rangaku within the context of the prohibition of Christianity.13 The Impact of Rangaku In 1720 the eighth shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, decided to ease the ban against the importation of Western books by making them available to certain officially recognized scholars. The decision grew mainly out of Yoshimune's interest in calendar reform, but it was also influenced by his desire to improve domestic commerce through appropriate practical Western techniques and by his fascination with the exotic.14 Yoshimune agreed with Hakuseki that Rangaku was superior in practical matters, and after the ban was eased, most of the books that were imported dealt with astronomy and calendar making. Other subjects such as the geography of foreign countries, the species of Western animals and plants, and machinery 12Quoted in S. Sat&lt;5, Yogakushi kenky? josetsu (Tokyo, 1964), pp. 11-12. 13 S. Sato holds the opposite view on this point. He says that the recognition of the superiority of Western science with respect to application was more or less common among intellectuals (i.e., men such as the Confucian scholar, Kaibara Ekken, and the astronomer, Nishikawa Jyoken); it was not Hakuseki's contribution. He also says that the Western sciences were never considered to be part of Christianity, and that it is therefore meaningless to emphasize Hakuseki's role in separating the two. I wish to emphasize on the contrary that Hakuseki was not just a scholar but a counselor to the shogunate. Even if Sato's claims were true, Hakuseki's restatement and confirmation of the practical nature of Western science and his reassurances about the dangers of Christianity, voiced in the inner circles of the shogunate, are of considerable sig nificance.

Saito, 'Tokugawa Yoshimune to seiyo bunka," Shigaku zasshi, 47 (1936), 1356-1377.</page><page sequence="9">10 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS were also encouraged by Yoshimune and were studied under the guidance of the Dutch.15 In 1740, when scholarly interest in Western learning had grown suffi ciently to allow a full-scale development of Rangaku, Yoshimune ordered the two scholars Aoki Konyo and Noro Genjo to study Rangaku. Genjo, with the help of interpreters, studied mainly botanical science and trans lated a few Dutch books into Japanese; Konyo wrote several books on the Dutch language. Although the level of their studies was relatively low? Konyo's writings, for instance, reveal a mediocre knowledge of Dutch grammar at best?Konyo and Genjo were the first scholars, as opposed to mere interpreters, to be concerned with Rangaku. Their work may thus be regarded as the start of serious study of Western learning in Japan.16 By easing the restrictions against books and encouraging the study of Western knowledge, Yoshimune created a favorable atmosphere for the de velopment of Rangaku. Sugita Gempaku in 1815 in his book Rangaku kotohajime17 (The Beginnings of Dutch Learning [in Japan]) wrote: "There was no one well versed in Western things; it is just that somehow or other people no longer seemed indifferent to Western things. Although there was no relaxation of the ban on the ordinary person possessing Dutch books and the like, the temper of the time became such that one frequently encountered people who did possess them."18 The study of Rangaku gradually and spontaneously increased among the ordinary Japanese. The most important manifestation of their new interest was the private translation of a Dutch book on anatomy19 by a group of Japanese led by Sugita Gempaku and Maeno Ryotaku. Most members of the group were physicians who, under a variety of circumstances, had become in terested in Dutch medicine. In his Rangaku kotohajime, Gempaku de scribes how they came to translate the Dutch text. Gempaku, Ryotaku, 15 For detailed information, see for example G. K. Goodman, The Dutch Impact on Japan (1640-1853) (Leiden, 1967), pp. 63 ff. 16J. Numata, Yogaku denrai no rekishi, pp. 31-46. 17The original title is Rant? kotohajime (The Beginnings of Dutch Learning in Japan), but the work was better known as Rangaku kotohajime. Ranto and Rangaku are synonyms. 18G. Sugita, Ranto kotohajime in Nihon koten bungaku taikei (Tokyo, 1964), 95, 486. 19This book, called Kaitai shinsho (A New Book of Anatomy) in its Japanese trans lation, was a Dutch translation of a German anatomy book by J. A. Kulmus. The Dutch translation from which they were translating was called Ontleedkundige Tafelen, Benevens de daar toe behoorende Afbeeldingen en Aanmerkingen, Waar in het Zaamenstel des Menschelijken Lichaams, en het gebruik van alle deszelfs Deelen afgebeeld en geleerd word (Amsterdam, 1734).</page><page sequence="10">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 11 and others had been invited to view the dissection of the body of an old woman who had been executed for a crime. At the dissection Ryotaku showed Gempaku a copy of the Dutch book on anatomy which he had ob tained in Nagasaki and which he had brought to the dissection for com parison. Gempaku, too, had just received a copy of the same book from a Japanese interpreter and had likewise brought it with him in order to com pare the illustrations with what he would observe at the dissection. The two physicians found to their mutual astonishment that the anatomical drawings in the Dutch book agreed completely with the corpse's anatomy. On the way home the group of physicians marveled over the accuracy of the Dutch drawings and their superiority over the philosophical explana tions of the human body of the Chinese texts on which they had pre viously depended. They lamented that they had been practicing medicine for all these years without a knowledge of human anatomy,20 and al though only Ryotaku knew any Dutch and that sketchily they determined to translate the book. To the eighteenth-century Japanese, it was far from obvious that anat omy and medicine are closely connected, and that without a knowledge of the former one cannot adequately practice the latter. That Gempaku and his colleagues were able to make this connection was highly significant for Japanese medicine. The assertion of the connection, however, did not lead to fundamental methodological changes in medical studies. Instead of a methodological shift from Chinese theory to Western pragmatism, Japa nese medical science after Gempaku merely shifted the source of medical authority from Chinese medical tomes to Dutch ones. In short, Gempaku's association of anatomy with good medical practice did not turn Japanese from a book-oriented knowledge of medicine to an entirely new and ex perimental methodology. It is hard to say definitely that Gempaku did not somehow glimpse new possibilities for medicine, even methodologically, but we can definitely say, even if such were the case, that those who followed him did not interpret his Dutch orientation to mean anything more than that Dutch books were better than Chinese ones. Gempaku's contributions to Rangaku drew others, mainly physicians, to him and Ryotaku for the study of Dutch learning. Among them, Otsuki Gentaku was especially important to the further progress of Rangaku. Gentaku came to Edo in 1778 to study Rangaku under Gempaku, com pleting his studies in 1785 and becoming physician to the Edo members of the Sendai fief. In the following year, he opened in Edo the largest and 20G. Sugita, Ranto kotohajime, pp. 489-492.</page><page sequence="11">12 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS best known private school for Rangaku, the Shirando. He wrote many books, among them Rangaku kaitei (The Ladder of Dutch Learning), an advanced work on the origins of Japanese-Dutch contacts and an analysis of the Dutch language, published in 1788, and Rangaku haikei (Introduc tion to the Study of Dutch Words), a beginner's language text, published in 1795. These two works were read from this period on by almost everyone who was interested in Rangaku.21 Other Japanese "scientific" fields were, of course, influenced by Dutch learning; I have discussed mainly the development of medical science in relation to Dutch learning because it tended to dominate the field. Never theless, other subjects such as astronomy, calendar making, and botany also developed under the influence of Dutch learning. Since Rangaku had influenced some traditional Japanese sciences such as medicine, the question arises whether or not it could have furthered the development of other traditional sciences. A related question is whether or not Rangaku itself could have been developed in private research along purely scientific lines simultaneously with its utilitarian development under official support. Here we must keep in mind that when Western science was first introduced through Rangaku, traditional Japanese "sci ence" consisted only of medicine, astronomy, botany, and mathematics, and that Western science affected each of these fields differently. Whereas medicine, astronomy, and botany had felt an immediate impact, mathe matics was at first very little influenced by Western science, particularly as far as the orthodox Japanese mathematics known as wasan was concerned. The wasan mathematicians claimed that in mathematics Japan was better than the West.22 They were proud of having developed a mathematics unique to Japan and of having created the only pure, as opposed to ap plied, science among the traditional sciences. As a consequence, recog nition of the practical value of Western mathematics came from men out side the ranks of mathematicians. Despite the aloofness of the wasan mathematicians themselves, however, the debate leading to the adoption of Western mathematics began. In 1857 an elementary book on Western mathematics using only Western notation and computation was published by Yanagawa Shunsan, not a wasan mathematician but a scholar of Dutch.23 Whereas Japanese mathematics had early departed from its source Chinese mathematics?and had developed in its own direction, other sci 211.

(Tokyo, 1935), 1, 318.</page><page sequence="12">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 13 enees in Japan never achieved independent status. For example, Chinese astronomy dominated until Western astronomy took its place in the 1730's, The Japanese showed little interest in exploring astronomical matters on their own or in experimenting with practical uses of astronomy such as calendar making; they simply adopted the Chinese calendar and did not reform it until 1684.24 Having developed no astronomy of their own, therefore, they were more disposed to adopt Western astronomy than Western mathematics. In a study of the development of Western physics in modern Japan, we cannot ignore all reference to physics in the pre-modern period. The Japanese, however, had no science resembling physics among their tradi tional sciences, and Japanese scholars knew little of Western physics until the nineteenth century, when they first began to give serious attention to Dutch books on "natural philosophy." The most notable study of Western natural philosophy was a work called Rekisho shinsho (New Handbook on Calendrical Phenomena) by Shizuki Tadao, an official interpreter in Nagasaki. The book was excerpts and summaries in Japanese of John Ke?Ts Introductiones ad veram Physicam et veram Astronomiam Quibus accedunt, Trigonometr?a, de viribus Centralibus. De legibus Attractiones (editio novissima, London 1739), which was prepared from Johan Lulofs' Dutch translation Inleidinge tot de waare Natuur- et Starrekunde (Amster dam, 1741). After retiring as an interpreter, Shizuki Tadao devoted more than twenty years to the study and translation of this Dutch text and completed it in three manuscript volumes in 1798, 1800, and 1802. The work, which was never published but circulated only in manuscript form, introduced Newtonian natural philosophy into Japan for the first time.25 Other Japanese scholars also became interested in the study of natural philosophy. Hoashi Banri, a Confucian scholar who had read Shizuki Tadao's translation, was one of the first to write a book on physics. His Ky?ri tsu (Proficiency in Natural Philosophy) was based on about thirteen Dutch books26 and comprised eight volumes of manuscript. In 1860 three 24S.

(note 25), p. 155.</page><page sequence="13">14 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS volumes of the work were published posthumously; the others remained in manuscript. In 1827, Aochi Rinso, a Rangaku scholar and student of Chinese medicine, published the first physics book in Japan. It was en titled Kikai kanran, which loosely translated means something like Obser vations of the Billowing Waves of Air and Sea, and was most likely based on two Dutch works by Johannes Buys, Natuurkundig Schoolboek and Volks-Natuurkunde. Rinso's small work explained briefly, in one or two pages per subject, such phenomena as rain, snow, light, color, temperature, attraction, and electricity. Despite its brevity, it treated almost all basic concepts then considered part of physics, and it was read widely by scholars. Rinso's son-in-law, Kawamoto Komin, published a sequel for physicians called Kikai kanran kogi (Observations of the Billowing Waves of Air and Sea, Enlarged) in fifteen volumes between 1851 and 18 56.27 In 1856, the physician Hirose Genkyo published a two-volume work called Rigaku teiyo (Summary of Natural Philosophy). It was based on a German work by J. N. Isfording which had been translated into Dutch by Epen and published in 1826 as Natuurkundig handboek voor leerlingen in de heel- en geneeskunde. Genkyo stated in his preface that his translation was in tended for physicians, as the original probably was. In the West, he ex plained, physicians study natural philosophy first before going on to anatomy and physiology and other biomedical subjects, and its study is therefore basic to medical training.28 One notices connections with medicine in the careers of several of the early investigators of Dutch natural philosophy; however, primary sources are so scant and modern research so little advanced that we cannot dis cover the motivation, aim, or use of these early studies of physics in Japan. All that is clear is that the significance of physics in pre-Meiji Japan was slight. The difference between the natural philosophy of the Rangaku period and the physics of the Meiji period is great. Two Institutional Manifestations of Rangaku After flourishing in a more or less free and private atmosphere, Rangaku changed again into an official arm of the shogunate. The threat of the West had begun to be felt seriously around the time of the Opium War in 1839 1842, and the uneasiness of the times was reflected in a shift of emphasis in Rangaku. Whereas before students interested primarily in Western medi cine or astronomy had dominated Rangaku studies, now those primarily interested in military science predominated. Rangaku as a whole became 21Ibid., pp. 121-136 and pp. 163-177. 2*Ibid., pp. 181-189.</page><page sequence="14">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 15 more and more the study of military science, and translations of Dutch books on military science gradually increased. The shogunate began to adopt Western military arts and to manufacture firearms such as guns and cannons. From the 1830's to Perry's arrival in 1853, a power struggle within the shogunate caused the official attitude toward Western military science to vary, but the number of samurai studying Western military science steadily increased.29 After Perry's arrival, a number of new governmental institutions for the study of military science and Western learning were set up. The increase in shogunal business with foreign countries and pressures from Japanese leaders to create a Western style army for protection compelled the sho gunate to establish a better source of information than their small, limited Rangaku Yakukyoku (Translation Bureau for Dutch Texts). The latter had been set up in 1811 mainly to translate Huishoudelijk Woordenboek by Noel Chomel, a work better known as Chomel's Encyclopedia.30 In 1855 the shogunate set up the Nagasaki Kaigun Densh?sho (Nagasaki Naval Academy), in 1856 the Bansho Shirabesho (Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books) and the Kobusho (Military Academy), and in 1857 the Gunkan S?rensho (Training Academy for Battleships) and the Nagasaki Igaku Densh?sho (Nagasaki Medical School). Of these several institutions, the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books was especially significant. It was intended specifically as a means of meeting the shortcomings of the old Translation Bureau for Dutch Texts. In 1855 the Translation Bureau was replaced by a yogakusho, or a bureau of Western learning, and in 1856 the new bureau was named the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books. The new institution was not only made responsible for the translation of sensitive foreign documents and for the teaching of subjects related to military science, but it was also given authority over aspects of Dutch learning unrelated to government business; in short it was both a governmental office and a training academy. At first only the Dutch language was taught, but in 1860 the curriculum was ex panded to include English, French, German, Russian, and some chemistry. In 1862 the office changed its name to Yosho Shirabesho, or Office for the Investigation of Western Books.31 The Nagasaki Naval Academy was significant, too, because it was the 29S.

At the request of the shogunate, the Dutch sent a steam-powered gunboat and crew to set up a training center at Nagasaki in July 1855.32 The first training period lasted a year and three months. A second gunboat with crew was sent to Japan in August 1857, and although the training of a second Japanese group was begun, the program was terminated in January 1859 because of domestic turmoil and financial difficulties. The Dutch taught subjects related to navigation, but, according to Com mander PelsRijcken, the leader of the first group, they encountered a serious obstacle in the Japanese trainees' lack of knowledge in such funda mental subjects as mathematics. After a year of study, however, students who at the start of training had been unable to compute without the help of an abacus could now calculate square and cube roots and even solve some of the most difficult problems in arithmetic. Some went on to study algebra and trigonometry, and a few came to understand the theory and practical use of logarithms.33 On the second gunboat was a medical officer, Pompe van Meerdervoort, who came to Japan at the request of the shogunate to teach medical sci ence. In addition to medicine he taught the Japanese trainees such subjects as physics, chemistry, and physiology, and he, too, recognized that "a serious hindrance to their progress" was "the want of elementary instruc tion in arithmetic, algebra, and mathematics."34 In spite of these diffi culties, however, the trainees were anxious to learn, and showed a great interest in the application of physics and chemistry. Meerdervoort wrote: By means of physics and chemistry the people also are anxious to im prove their manufactories and institutions of arts; and my pupils so far as they are able, communicate to others what they themselves have ac quired. By this method several manufacturers and merchants have al ready introduced improvements in their cotton fabrics. These improve ments are observable in their application of both chemical ingredients and mechanical forces. The numerous questions which they have daily to propose, in regard to their instruction, give me pleasing evidence of their success, showing that they are not only indefatigable in their study of 32 The gunboat arrived as a goodwill gift from the King of Holland. 33J.

Western sciences were beginning to find a home in officially supported institutions, which was one of Rangaku's most important legacies to modern science. Rangaku and Meiji Science: Rupture and Continuity It becomes clear that, apart from the institutional or administrative con tributions of Rangaku, neither Rangaku nor the traditional Japanese sci ences provided the basis for the great successes of science in the Meiji period. The career of Nagaoka Hantar?, one of Japan's early physicists, is evidence for this view. As a young student in the early Meiji period, Nagaoka gave no thought to the achievements o? Rangaku; before deciding on a scientific career, he sought reassurance through Chinese science (rather than through Japanese work with Rangaku or through the tradi tional Japanese sciences) that Orientals had a potential for scientific achievement. He was able to ignore Rangaku and early Japanese science precisely because there was so little continuity between the Dutch and Japanese learning and Meiji science. In its attempt to Westernize, Japan dis carded many of the inheritances of the pre-Meiji period. The discontin uity between Rangaku and Meiji science can be further illustrated by the rapid rise of English, French, and German learning during the Meiji period and a concomitant rapid decline of Dutch learning. The foreign scientists who were invited to teach in Meiji Japan were mostly from America, England, France, and Germany, not from the Netherlands. The Japanese had been shocked to discover that there were actually very few Western ers who understood Dutch, and that the various nations of the Western world differed widely in their cultures. The departure of Rangaku is a conspicuous characteristic of Meiji Japan. Nevertheless, a certain continuity between Dutch learning and Meiji sci ence can be detected in the ways in which knowledge was acquired from foreign sources. One was the use of foreign instructors. Before the Meiji period, the visit by Philipp von Siebold was perhaps the most important by any Westerner. A German physician employed by the Dutch East India Company, Siebold was sent to Japan to practice medicine among the 35?btd, p. 215.</page><page sequence="17">18 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Dutch at Dejima Island. He later received permission from the commis sioner of Nagasaki to leave Dejima to teach medicine and other natural sciences to the Japanese outside the foreign settlement;36 he thus became one of the earliest officially recognized foreign teachers for Japanese students. Important in this connection were foreigners invited from abroad to teach Japanese trainees at the Nagasaki Naval Academy; although the main subject taught there was military science, the systematic instruction by foreign experts resembled that by foreign scientists in the Meiji period. The continuity between Rangaku and Meiji science is also seen in con tinued translations of Western books and the dispatch of students to Western countries for advanced studies.37 Meiji translations of Western books differed from the earlier only in their sources; Dutch books were replaced by English, French, and German ones; the eagerness with which translations of Western books was undertaken continued unabated, and when all restrictions were lifted, the number of translations greatly in creased. The dispatch of students to the West was largely a Meiji endeavor, but in 1862, before the Meiji Restoration, the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books had already sent students to Holland to study not only the natural sciences but also philosophy and law.38 Thus, in spite of the fact that Dutch learning ceased to exist and its accomplishments were ignored in the Meiji period, the methods by which the Japanese pursued Western learning and the foundations on which Japanese science was built remained largely the same during the shift from Rangaku to Meiji science. Because it was the one concrete source of continuity between the old and the new age of Japanese science, the establishment of the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books can be considered the most important contribution of Rangaku; it was this institution which, combined with others, formed the core of the University of Tokyo, and it was the Uni versity of Tokyo that was almost wholely responsible for the introduction and institutionalization of the Western science disciplines in Japan. The bridge between the pre-Meiji and post-Meiji "scientific" institutions in Japan was the samurai, who saw clearly the need for a strong Japanese 36J. Numata, Yugaku denrai no rekishi, pp. 137-139. 37From 1862 to 1868 there were five occasions when students were sent abroad by the shogunate to study the natural and social sciences. During this period forty-seven students were sent to France, England, Holland, Russia, and the United States. In ad dition to those sent by the government, a number of students were sent abroad by various fiefs. See M. Watanabe, "Japanese Students Abroad and the Acquisition of Scientific and Technical Knowledge," Journal of World History, 9 (1965), 254-293. Ibid., p. 258.</page><page sequence="18">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 19 military stance in a newly threatening world. Japan's first generation of physicists, indeed almost all of the early Japanese scientists who modeled themselves on the Western scientist, were former samurai. Japan's con frontation with the West in the early 1800's resulted in a strong reaction by the samurai rulers to the encroachment of the West and in their quick recognition of the superiority of Western military technology. In this re spect Japan presents a startling contrast to China, which failed to respond in any effective way at all.39 The speed and relative accuracy of Japan's perception of Western military strength were partly owing to its long his tory of military rule by feudal warriors, the samurai. Although the samurai were essentially military men, they constituted at the same time Japan's intellectual class. Prior to the seventeenth century the average samurai had been primarily a warrior occupied with the civil wars that had disturbed Japanese society for centuries. However, after Japan's reunification about 1600 had brought a peace that was to last some two hundred and fifty years, the samurai was forced to adopt a role appropriate to a peacetime society. It became the duty of the samurai to pursue both military train ing and general learning to make themselves better governors. By the end of the seventeenth century they had become "a reasonably literate and culturally polished class dedicated to the problem of civil administra tion."40 As the intellectuals of the nation, they constituted the main body of Rangaku scholars and, under the threat from the West from around 1830, the body best equipped to study Western military science. The emergence of Western military science as a major subject for study was of great importance to the development of science in Japan for at least two reasons. First, it created a body of men who later went beyond the study of military science per se to the study of the natural sciences. Second, it led to the establishment of the various institutes for military science to which foreign experts were invited and in which Western natural sciences such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and medicine were taught systematically for the first time in Japan. Westernization as Progress: The Bootstrap Psychology Since there was no common and fully developed understanding of Western science in Japan during the first half of the nineteenth century, it is important to determine the forces that united Japanese attitudes toward 39J.

Hall, Japan: From Prehistory to Modern Times (New York, 1968), p. 196.</page><page sequence="19">20 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS science in the Meiji era. Aside from military need as a conspicuous unifier, the Japanese shared an appreciation of the practical value of Western science generally. An account of the process whereby the Japanese attitude toward Western science changed from a narrow and suspicious stance to one of widespread enthusiasm is crucial to our understanding of the ulti mate success of Western science in Japan and of the physics discipline in particular. During the closing days of the Tokugawa period, while Rangaku was still Japan's only source of knowledge about the West, the Japanese looked upon Western scientific techniques as expedients to adopt for self protec tion; they ignored the rest of Western civilization, if they did not hold it in contempt. Their attitude was captured in the slogan Toy o dotoku, Seiyd gakugei, or "Eastern ethics, Western techniques," coined by the samurai scholar Sakuma Zozan. Zozan, a Confucian, took up Western gunnery, be came interested in chemistry, tried his hand at manufacturing glass and cannons, and in general advocated the adoption of Western military tech niques. He favored the opening of Japan to Western knowledge, but only to learn the techniques for defending it from the outside world. As far as the cultural or ethical side of civilization was concerned, he believed with most of his contemporaries that Japan was unquestionably superior.41 His viewpoint was completely appropriate to a society in which the ruling class sought to reinforce the old feudal order while supplementing it in material ways. With the Meiji Restoration in 1868, however, the distinctions between ethics and techniques were lost sight of in the initial wave of enthusiasm for all things Western. The old dichotomy between Eastern ethics and Western techniques would surface again after the Western enthusiasm had subsided; but for the first decade or so, Western civilization was imported and emulated so extensively that it began to affect all of Japanese life. A new national slogan emerged reflecting the new age of the fully opened door: Bummei kaika, or "Civilization and Enlightenment." Efforts by the Japanese to live up to the slogan resulted in considerable confusion. There were those who, wanting to be "civilized," threw out their traditional clothing and started to wear Western clothes. They also began to eat meat, a food that for economic and, more important, for religious reasons had never been eaten in Japan. Such emulation might seem superficial, even amusing, yet there were sound reasons for the Japanese to adopt some of 41R. Tsunoda et al., ed., Sources of Japanese Tradition (New York, 1959), pp. 603-616.</page><page sequence="20">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 21 the material aspects of Western civilization: flowing robes, wooden foot gear, and traditional hair styles produced indulgent smiles, if not guffaws, in Washington or London. Japan was urgently seeking equal status with the great powers, and it made the sad discovery that Westerners took a Japa nese statesman more seriously in a frock coat and with a beard than in a kimono and with a shaved forehead. The change in values that underlay the concerted effort to Westernize everything from architecture to food and clothing in the new Japan is ap parent from an illustration in a book published in the early 1870's (see frontispiece). Three Japanese are shown: one wears the traditional kimono and swords, and has his forehead shaved and his remaining hair tied back in the traditional chommage hairdo; the second wears a half-traditional, half-modern (half-Western) costume consisting of the kimono, an umbrella and a pocketwatch instead of a sword, and a Western cap instead of the chommage hairdo; the third wears a modern (Western) frock coat, trousers, and top hat, and carries a cane. The captions identifying the three read "uncivilized," "half-civilized," and "civilized" man.42 The illustration is neither naive nor trivial; by identifying the civilized or cultured man with the Western costume, the Japanese artist testified to the new sentiment. He expressed another important idea by presenting the three figures in a single picture. If the picture had shown only a man dressed in Western clothing and identified him as "civilized," it would have indicated a par ticular understanding of the concept of "civilized" as defined by a foreign model; but since the three figures are juxtaposed, the picture shows that the artist was aware that Japan was undergoing "progress" in the change from the old Japan to the new. Words like "progress" and "civilization" were attractive and inspiring to the Japanese of the latter half of the nineteenth century. They fully be lieved that progress, whatever that might be, was possible for Japan. The Japanese attitude toward these words was, of course, a result of the con frontation with the West in the 1850's, but there were other factors that contributed to it. In his discussion of the legacy of Tokugawa education, R. P. Dore points to some of them. According to Dore, the level of literacy in Meiji Japan was not low; education was widespread and eagerly sought, and it was not a case of the government's subjecting the people to un welcome instruction or "civilization." Dore argues that the "voluntary choice and sacrifice" of the Japanese to educate themselves in new ways 42 A reproduction of this illustration can be found in J. Fairbank, E. Reischauer, and A. Craig, East Asia: The Modern Transformation (Boston, 1965), plate 23.</page><page sequence="21">22 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS and their belief in the possibility of self-improvement are evidence that Japan was a society that had overcome one of the most difficult and most frequently encountered obstacles to modernization: the view that man's fate is unchangeable. In the ideal-typical "traditional society," things are as they are, and the individual does not see himself as offered the choice of doing, or not doing, anything to alter his society or his position in it. Japan was not such a society. By taking thought one could add an inch to one's, or one's children's, stature, perhaps improve their opportunities in a mate rial sense, certainly?in a society in which learning was generally valued? enhance their prestige and self-respect. This awareness, and desire for self-improvement, ensured that opportunities created by the technologi cal and political changes would be eagerly taken up. A competitive society could be more easily created because a large proportion of the population had been psychologically prepared to offer themselves as competitors. And where the notion of individual self-improvement was widely diffused the notion of national improvement could be more readily understood and accepted.43 Under these circumstances, therefore, it is not surprising to find that upon their encounter with the West the Japanese saw themselves as already ad vancing toward civilization, and they were eager to fully attain it. They expressed their desire for advancement in both domestic and international concerns. The strong conviction that a nation could improve itself appeared quite often in Japanese writings of the period. When the Darwinian theory of evolution and the Spencerian theory of social evolution were introduced into Japan in the late 1870's and early 1880's, they were, therefore, easily accepted, even welcomed.44 Both of these theories had a great influence 43 R. P. Dore, "The Legacy of Tokugawa Education," in Changing Japanese Atti tudes Toward Modernization, M. B. Jansen, ed. (Princeton, 1965), pp. 101-102. 44M. Koizumi, Nihon kagakushi shiko (Tokyo, 1943), pp. 457-458. The ease with which Darwinian theory was introduced into Japan is partially due to the lack of Christian influence at that time; there was even a certain hostility to Christian tenets. R. S. Schwantes has commented that "the missionaries quickly realized that the strongest opponent [to the conversion of the Japanese to Christianity] was not the religions and superstitions of old Japan but the skepticism of modern Europe"; the latter entered Japan with Western learning. See R. S. Schwantes, "Christianity versus Science: A Conflict of Ideas in Modern Japan," Far Eastern Quarterly, 12 (1953), 124.</page><page sequence="22">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 23 on Japanese views of society, especially in underscoring their belief in Japan's ability to lift itself out of a feudal middle age and compete on terms of equality with modern Western nations. At the same time the con cept of competition as represented by the Darwinian expression "survival of the fittest"? y?shd reppai, or "superior wins, inferior loses," as it was translated into Japanese?contributed to a broadening of the competitive spirit in Japan. For more than a thousand years the Japanese had valued an ethic of self-improvement that meant literally that one competes with oneself to improve oneself. Now that Japan was confronted with an ap parently superior and powerful West, the ethic no longer referred to indi vidual self-improvement, but to a national competition in which the entire nation lifted itself by its own bootstraps so that it could compete with the encroaching Western nations. The Selling of Western Science Apart from the government, which encouraged the adoption of various aspects of Western learning and civilization through its policies and through the founding of institutions, private popularizers played an indispensible part in the creation of Japan's positive attitude toward Western science and modernization. No man outside the government was more influential in this regard than Fukuzawa Yukichi, the most famous propagandist for Western learning and civilization in Meiji Japan. Born to a low-ranking samurai family in 1835, Fukuzawa went to Nagasaki in 1854 to study Dutch and Western gunnery with Rangaku scholars, a move that a number of samurai made in response to Perry's threatening arrival the year before. In 1855 he moved to Osaka to continue his Dutch studies and to learn the rudiments of Western physics, chemistry, and medicine from a well-known physician. In 1858 he was asked by his fief to start a school in Edo?which later became Keio University, one of Japan's first and most famous private universities?to teach Dutch to fief members residing there. On a visit to Yokohama, however, Fukuzawa was stunned to learn that the residents in the small foreign settlement there could not understand a word of Dutch and that his years of study had been in vain. He immediately set about teaching himself English, and in 1860 he signed onto a Japanese ship sailing to San Francisco as personal servant to the captain. Two years later he was sent to Europe as an interpreter for a treaty delegation; an avid ob server of Western life, he made prodigious notes on Western institutions and on anything that he felt would not be explained in books. His note books provided the basis for a book he wrote in 1866, Seiyd jijo (Con</page><page sequence="23">24 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS ditions in the West), which became a best seller and established Fukuzawa as one of the country's chief authorities on the West.45 Fukuzawa felt that at a time when Japan's confrontation with the West was marred by confusion about the West, his primary task must be to offer guidance to the Japanese public by informing them of the true nature of Western civilization and its potential contribution to Japan. Fukuzawa, though an educator and journalist and not a scientist, also played a key role in inculcating in the Japanese public an attitude receptive to Western science.46 He was fascinated by science, and he believed that as long as the Japanese did not view their natural environment as Westerners did, i.e., in a "scientific way," they would never grasp the spirit of Western civilization nor acquire a "civilizing" level of material and technical affluence. In 1868 he wrote Kummo kyuri zukai (Elementary Natural Philosophy with Illus trations), a book that was popular throughout the 1870's. Through it he hoped to instill in the general reader an appreciation of the necessity of examining his natural environment in light of the new Western explana tions of natural phenomena. The Japanese had always lived close to nature, but they had had an accepting, not a probing and questioning, relationship with nature. Western science now provided a new way of looking at and explaining the world. The new attitude is illustrated by the rejection of traditional explanations of lightning, one of which was that it was the anger of the lightning god, and the acceptance of the modern explanation of lightning as electricity. Although the view of lightning as electricity and that of lightning as the anger of a god might have been equally satisfying as explanations, the practical implications of the new explanation made it superior to the traditional one. In Japan the Western explanation of lightning was introduced together with a practical electrical device that could save people's lives, the lightning rod, and with vivid accounts of its efficacy in preventing disasters in the West.47 The traditional Japanese ex planation of lightning suggested prayer to the lightning god as the only 45For full details on Fukuzawa, see Y. Fukuzawa, The Autobiography ofYukichi Fukuzawa, trans. E. Kiyooka (New York, 1966). 46Fukuzawa's Gakumon no susume (Encouragement of Learning), written between 1872 and 1876, and Bummeiron no gairyaku (Outline of Civilization), written in 1875, were probably the most frequently read books of this period, arousing interest not only in the cities but also in rural areas. To this day it is possible to uncover copies of his works stored away among the treasured belongings of old Japanese farming families in remote areas. See D. Irokawa, Meiji no bunka (Tokyo, 1970), p. 68. 47A. Obata, Tempenchii (Tokyo, 1868).

The new explana tions, allowing for applications, served to break down old superstitions, to reduce fear, and to establish a new relationship between man and his environment. In his Kummo ky?ri zukai, Fukuzawa compared the man who lives in the midst of nature and yet is oblivious to its true workings to a horse that eats without knowing what it is eating. His discussion dealt mainly with phenomena of daily life: heat, air, water, weather, universal attraction, the seasons, and eclipses. Since he wrote the book for the general public, he confined himself to illustrating the new explanations of natural phenomena; he did not present natural philosophy or physics as something worth pursuing as a pure science. Fukuzawa urged the reader to reflect upon the various natural phenomena, but he did not provide a methodology or a theoretical basis for explaining all phenomena. He talked about universal gravitation, for instance, but only to explain the relation ship between the sun and the earth and to show why objects on earth do not fly away under the influence of centrifugal force.48 Fukuzawa, in short, gave Western science a popular formulation that allowed his Japa nese audience, which up to that time had been either indifferent or mis informed, to examine a selection of its contents for themselves. Although he made no pretense of teaching physics per se, he prepared the Japanese mind for the idea that, above all else, the principles of nature should be studied by the new citizen of the new age. In 1882 Fukuzawa published a short article "Butsurigaku no yoyo" ("The Necessity of Physics") which clarified his view of science:49 Physics is a study based upon the laws of nature which clarifies the properties of things, perceives their functions, and applies these findings in the service of human affairs, and it naturally has some elements which differ from other branches of knowledge. For example, although we now speak of economics and commerce and refer to both as branches of knowledge, under present circumstances things like economics and commerce still do not in the least base themselves upon the laws of nature. The reason I say this is that in economics and commerce there are those who advocate a free economy and those who are protectionists, 48 Y. Fukuzawa, Kummo ky?ri zukai (Tokyo, 1868). The third edition (1872) is re printed in Fukuzawa Yukichi zensh? (Tokyo, 1960); see pp. 269-272. 49 Y.

Scholars in England say that a free economy is reasonable, while scholars in America say that a pro tective economy is the proper way, and listening to them, it seems that both make sense. Thus we are compelled to say that the principles of economics and commerce in England and America are of different molds. [However,] the principles of nature are not at all that way. From the beginning of creation up until today the world has remained the same throughout ancient and modern times and has not changed. Water in the prehistoric age boiled when it met with heat at a temperature of 212?F, and water in the [present] Meiji period reacts in the same way. Steam in the West and in the East do not differ in expansive force. If an American dies of taking too much morphine, a Japanese also dies if he takes the same dosage. These we call the principles of nature, and the search for them and the use of them we call physics. There should be nothing which escapes these principles. If there is something which seems not to follow them, one should understand it to be a case where the search for principles has been insufficient.50 Fukuzawa was by no means the only spokesman for Western science, al though he was the most articulate and famous. He was unusual among scholars and popularizers of Western studies in being one of the first and most influential writers to demonstrate a concern for making Western science generally accessible in Japan. Japanese men of science did not devote much of their time to the popu larization of Western science. Only a few tried to reach beyond the scholarly community to explain science and its uses to the Japanese public and to affect public opinion. Some advocated science as the source of a new morality. Sugiura Jugo, for instance, who had been educated as a chemist in England from 1876 to 1880 and had returned to become a well known educator and nationalist, in 1888 attempted to explain all human affairs by means of the energy conservation law and the wave theory. According to Sugiura, the energy conservation law explains why a person who does good goes to heaven and one who does otherwise goes to hell: to do good is to store up the energy required to enter heaven.51 His use of the wave theory is as crude as his use of the energy conservation law. He sees all phenomena as possessing a cyclic nature to which the wave theory 50Ibid., p. 49. 51J. Sugiura, "Jinji mo mata butsuri no teisoku o hanarezu," Yomiuri shimbun (22 June 1888), reprinted in Sugiura Jugo sensei zensh? (Tokyo, 1945), 1, 126.</page><page sequence="26">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 27 can be applied; for him the rise and decline of a nation or person point to the application of the wave theory to all affairs in the universe.52 Sugiura's application of the energy conservation law is reminiscent of the philosophy of energy held by the German physical chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Around 1902 Ostwald tried to explain all phenomena, natural and social, by a single reality, energy. However, Ostwald's objective differed greatly from that of Sugiura, who seems to have had two purposes. One was to establish a moral system based upon science rather than religion. The other was to create a new theory by which all future mun dane events would become as predictable as astronomical phenomena, for Sugiura believed predictability to be one of the most important attributes of physics.53 In all of his considerations, however, he was much more con cerned with society than with nature, and it was perhaps this concern that led him to give up chemistry and to become an educational administrator and writer after his return from England. It is noteworthy that he in terpreted physics not as a weapon against nature, as it was so often in terpreted in the West, but as a key to the establishment of a new type of society. In this respect his view of physics resembled Fukuzawa's% One of the most articulate spokesmen for pure science was Kikuchi Dairoku, a graduate in mathematics from Cambridge University in 1877, who returned to Japan to become the first Professor of Mathematics at the University of Tokyo and to later serve as President of the University (1898) and Minister of Education (1901). In 1884 Kikuchi gave a speech about science in which he sought to clear up popular confusion about the difference between pure and applied science. Kikuchi felt no need to ex plain applied science, which was understood and which was indeed the main concern of government leaders. Rather he took particular pains to elucidate the importance of pure science. Using the discoveries of elec trical engineering as examples, he explained that without the foundation provided by prior basic research on electric current even hundreds of Edi sons and Bells could not have developed electric lights or the telephone.54 Kikuchi's defense of pure science shows how highly Japanese society valued practical science at that time. In emphasizing the benefits of pure science, he shows himself, too, a product of his age and he indicates an understanding of his audience. 52Ibid., pp. 127-128. 53Ibid., pp. 129-130. 54D.

They differed from their contemporary Sakurai Joji, who had received his education in chemistry at the University of London from 1876 to 1881, during the time that Sugiura was in England, and re turned to become Professor of Chemistry at the University of Tokyo and, later, Dean of the College of Science. In 1888, he published a short article, "Rigakusha no kairaku" ("The Pleasure of the Scientist"),55 in which he viewed science as an autonomous entity and described the scientist as the craftsman of a "castle of knowledge," who, by adding new knowledge to the castle, gains pleasure and honor. Sakurai's nonconformist interpreta tion of science and his failure to draw any moralistic conclusion from science point to an attitude close to one that values science for its own sake. That attitude was at best short-lived; science for its own sake does not seem to have had other advocates in Japan until Poincar?'s writings appeared there in the early decades of the twentieth century.56 Despite his early view of science, Sakurai gradually came to emphasize the value of science as a source of power for the nation. In 1899, eleven years after publishing his article "The Pleasure of the Scientist," Sakurai expressed this new view in his "Kokka to rigaku" ("The Nation and Science").57 At the beginning of the article he reiterated the view he had expressed in his 1888 article, but he used a different image. He said that science is that which advances human knowledge and which investigates the structure and operation of the vast machine called nature. He was evi dently the first in Japan to refer to nature as a machine placed at man's disposal.58 He used an image familiar to the machine age?to the age of steamships and locomotives that Japan had entered?and one more realistic and practical than that of a castle of knowledge. Sakurai's main point was that the nation in which pure science flourishes best acquires the most power. The change in Sakurai's position from insistence on the autonomy of scientific activity to an emphasis on the advantages the nation derives from science reflects the modernization process Japan had been under going during those years and the growing national self-confidence that accompanied it. 55 J.

That war was Japan's first after the outside world had begun to threaten it, and the first foreign war in its history. It was a time of rising self-esteem and national ism; after the war the Japanese spoke less of survival and more of pulling abreast with and surpassing the West. The West, which had tended to look indulgently on the "superficiality" of Japan's modernization, was amazed by the "reality" of its victory over China. Europe became extravagantly enthusiastic about Japan: its arts were admired and the kimono became a fad. Edwin Arnold wrote in The Spectator that "in attacking China in Corea, [Japan] is guarding the civilized world."59 The Western reaction further encouraged Japan's drive toward scientific excellence. The Japa nese could now believe that through science Japan had already pulled itself up by its bootstraps. It had survived, and now science was to lead it to the heights of civilization. 3. THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PHYSICS AND THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINES Japan's First University Throughout Japan's modern history the University of Tokyo has played the major role in the introduction of Western knowledge, especially of Western science. Table A (Appendix) shows in detail the gradual develop ment of educational institutions leading up to the founding of the Uni versity of Tokyo. In 1870 the Japanese government began to combine several educational institutions into one loosely coordinated "university." Its origins dated from the 1630's when the Hayashi family started what might be called a state university with the backing of the Tokugawa shogunate and offered a curriculum largely devoted to the Chinese classics and Confucian studies. This school was designated the core of the newly expanded institution and was referred to as the Daigaku or Uni versity. The descendent of the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books, known as the Kaiseijo (Kaiseijo Office), was renamed Daigaku Nanko, or University, Southern Division, in 1870, and was intended to 59Quoted in D.

Another division, Tokyo Igakk?, or the Tokyo Medical School, also joined the complex. Ironically, it was the original state university that failed to survive the transition. Debates over the nature of its role in the complex of facilities and the desirability of its concentration on Chinese and Confucian studies divided the faculty and administrators and led to the total collapse of the university. The Daigaku Nanko, or University, Southern Division, however, prospered and became more or less independent, simplifying its name to Nanko or Southern Division in 1871, to Daiichi Daigaku Ku Daiichiban Ch?gakk? (The First Middle School of the First University) in 1872, and to Tokyo Kaisei Gakko" (The Tokyo Kaisei School) in 1873; in 1877 it was combined with the Tokyo Medical School to form the University of Tokyo. The Tokyo Kaisei School was the descendent of the Office for the Investigation of Barbarian Books, separated from its ancestor by a period of seventeen years and many name changes. Similarly the Tokyo Medical School had evolved over a period of ten years and under various names from the Edo Shutojo (Edo Vaccination Office). Both original institutions had been established as the result of the impact of the West; their aims be came those of the University of Tokyo, which they ultimately formed. In 1886, in the last major change in university education, the Ministry of Education under the Meiji government issued the Imperial University Ordinance, which designated the University of Tokyo as Teikoku Daigaku, or Imperial University. For the first time, the University's role in a new Japan was clearly defined, as is clear from the first article of the Ordi nance: "The Imperial University is to take as its aim the teaching of the liberal and vocational arts which respond to the needs of the nation, as well as the pursuit of the deepest principles behind them."60 The University of Tokyo at its inception in 1877 had four faculties, those of law, medicine, literature, and science. Upon becoming the Im perial University in 1886, however, a college of engineering was added by absorbing into the University the Kobu Daigakk?, or School of Engineer ing, that had been run by the Ministry of Engineering since 1873. The latter, an independent scientific educational institution, had trained more than two hundred engineers for the Ministry by the time it joined the Imperial University. The decision to include the School of Engineering in the University clearly reflected the needs of the time in Japan; from the 60Quoted in T. Okubo,Nikon no daigaku (Tokyo, 1943), p. 315.</page><page sequence="30">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 31 standpoint of educational policy it was an unusual and farsighted move, recognized as innovative even by foreign observers.61 In 1886 the first graduate school was established, marking the com pletion of a modern university in Japan. The Imperial University went through one more name change when, in 1897, another Imperial Univer sity was built in Kyoto. The original Imperial University then took the name Tokyo Imperial University, and the new one the name Kyoto Im perial University. The Problem of Instructional Language In 1873 the Tokyo Kaisei School, one of the predecessors of the Uni versity of Tokyo, made the important decision to adopt English as its major foreign language.62 Since 1868, the students of the institution had been studying their subjects using English, German, and French. The abrupt change to English proved impossible for some students and com pelled school officials to find a device that would enable some to complete their studies in French or German. They created two temporary divisions of the Tokyo Kaisei School for this purpose: Shogeigakka and Kozangakka. The former was a Japanese equivalent of an Ecole polytechnique and was intended for students whose only foreign language was French; the latter was a newly formed Department of Mining which received all students who knew only German.63 Thereafter the school officials accepted no new ap plications for admission to these departments, for they planned to termi nate them as soon as the original students had graduated. The significant point is that educational divisions were made on the basis of the language of instruction, not on the basis of subject matter. However, these divisions proved too great a financial burden on the school, which was reluctant to provide the equipment necessary for the various subjects. The divisions 61Tanakadate Aikitsu, a physicist, recorded in his diary the following comment that W. K. R?ntgen made to him when he visited R?ntgen in 1898. R?ntgen said, "It was certainly farsighted of your country to class the engineering school on a level with the university. Although we are about to set up that sort of organization [in Ger many] , obstinate old men of theology and law object to it as if they understand everything, and so we have been hindered by them/' Tanakadate's diary is deposited at the National Science Museum in Tokyo. 62Needless to say there were no textbooks concerning scientific subjects written in the Japanese language. All books selected for classroom use were written in foreign languages. 63Tokyo teikoku daigaku goj?nenshi (hereafter abbreviated as TTDG) (Tokyo, 1932), 1, 258-259.</page><page sequence="31">32 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS were abolished in 1875, two years after they had been set up, and new divisions were organized for the remaining students. The school established two more limited departments: French Physics for the old Shogeigakka students and German Chemistry for the Kozangakka students.^ Since only ten students applied to the German Chemistry Department as compared to forty-three applicants to the French Physics Department, the school officials decided to cancel the German Chemistry Department.64 The French Physics Department, called Futsugo Butsurigakka, or Department of French Language Physics, survived until 1880 when the last students graduated from it; in all, it graduated twenty students: five in 1878, seven in 1879, and eight in 1880.65 By 1880 English was the main foreign language for all students. That year German became the required second foreign language, and French was discontinued as an option for students in the sciences.66 But from 1877, when the University of Tokyo was established, to 1880, physics had been taught separately in both French and English. The expensive duplica tion had the unforeseen advantage of preventing the dominance of any one Western country in the introduction of Western sciences. If in its efforts to modernize, Japan had fallen under the exclusive or predominant influence of a single Western country, it would have lost the freedom to choose whatever it wanted from different countries. In medicine, for instance, Japan adopted the German system and invited medical doctors from Germany to practice, teach, and help set up a national medical system. Or again, the Japanese navy was established according to the British system, the army according to the French system with later German modifications. The great advantage that Japan derived from free access to all of Western civilization was partly offset by the many problems arising from the im portation of various institutions from different countries with their differ ent cultures. Thus, Japan not only had to make an adjustment between her own traditional culture and Western culture, but also had to make effec tive compromises between different Western cultures. For instance, the Japanese army bought weapons from Germany, while the navy bought battleships from England. Since Germany and Britain used different mea suring systems, the standardization of imported industrial goods was a difficult problem; neither the army nor the navy was willing to compro 64Ibid., pp. 301-302. *5Ibid? p. 626. 66Ibid., pp. 640-646.</page><page sequence="32">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 33 mise. 7 In this example the conflict is clear, but subtler cases make it diffi cult to determine the overall effect of European cultural heterogeneity on Japan's modernization. The differences in approach to national problems, to education, and to personal relations among Europeans forced the Japa nese to conclude that they could successfully carry out the task of mod ernization only by a piecemeal introduction of Western civilization, select ing what seemed useful from the various countries. Nevertheless, the im portation of Western civilization in this way caused the Japanese living in the transitional period to feel a lack of continuity and to sense the lack of something capable of holding together the different cultures. Foreign Teachers Specialists, too, were imported along with Western learning. Between 1872 and 1898, the Japanese government employed more than 6,000 foreigners, mainly English, French, German, and American. If privately employed Westerners are included, there were more than 18,000 foreign specialists in Japan at various times during this period.68 The specialists were called oyatoi gaikokujin, or "honorable foreign em ployees," a term frequently abbreviated to oyatoi, or "honored em ployees." Although oyatoi gaikokujin had been brought to Japan prior to the Meiji period, the peak of their importation came in the mid-1870's; there were 524 employed by the government in 1874, and 527 in 1875. Thereafter, the number fell rapidly, decreasing by half in five years; in 1894 fewer than a hundred remained. The number of privately employed foreigners increased steadily, except for a short period of decline around 1886, reaching a maximum of 765 in 1897.69 The reason for the rapid de crease of the number of foreign employees in the government was largely financial. The salaries of the oyatoi gaikokujin employed by the University of Tokyo in 1877 made up as much as one-third of the entire budget of the Ministry of Education, a financial burden that hastened the replace ment of the oyatoi gaikokujin by Japanese in government institutions.70 Of the oyatoi gaikokujin employed by the government in 1880, the engineers and schoolteachers outnumbered all others. Throughout the Meiji period, the teachers of the natural sciences formed the largest class of 67N. Umetani, Oyatoi gaikokujin (Tokyo, 1968), 1, 215. Ibid., pp. 52-53. ^Ibid.

Of these, one half were German, approximately one fifth were British and another fifth American, and the remainder were largely French, with a few teachers from other countries. The engineers, however, were largely from England; the British contingent accounted for almost seventy-eight percent of the total.71 Generally speaking, therefore, German and British influence was strong in the natural sciences and engineering. With regard to physics I must qualify my conclusion: no German physics specialists were invited to Japan, so that there was no direct German contribution from the oyatoi gaikokujin to Japanese physics. However, from the 1880's on, a consider able number of Japanese physicists went to Germany for postgraduate work.72 The original members of the Faculty of Science, consisting of the five departments of Chemistry, Mathematics-Physics-Astronomy, Biology, En gineering, and Geology-Mining, are given in Table B (Appendix). Berson and Mangeot, together with a third professor, Prosper Fouque, who left in 1877 when the University of Tokyo was established, had been members of the French Physics Department. Mangeot left the University in 1879 and Berson in 1880 when the department was terminated.73 Most of the origi nal faculty were oyatoi gaikokujin, which indicates that Japan was still dependent on foreign expertise. Fourteen years later, however, the oyatoi gaikokujin in the College of Science had been completely replaced by Japanese professors. Two processes were at work during this period. First, as their contracts ran out the old oyatoi gaikokujin were replaced by new ones; by 1882 the original oyatoi gaikokujin had all left the University. Second, Japanese began to be promoted to professors. Of the faculty members representing physics or closely related disciplines, R. H. Smith, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, left the department in 1878, and in October of the same year James A. Ewing, a Scot, came as his replace ment; P. Veeder, Professor of Physics, also left in 1878, and Thomas C. Mendenhall, an American, was invited to replace him. In 1879 Yamagawa Kenjiro was promoted to Professor of Physics, and Mangeot, Professor of 71/fci&lt;?, p. 54 and pp. 88-89. 72For fuller discussion, see below, Chapter IV, section on "Foreign and Domestic Training." 73TTDG, 1, dlb-dll.

In 1880 Hiraoka Morisabur?74 was appointed Professor of Physics, and Debsky and Berson left. In 1881 Mendenhall left, as did Ewing in 1883, the year Cargill Knott, an Englishman, was hired. In 1886, when the University of Tokyo became the Imperial University and the Faculty of Science became the College of Science, only two oyatoi gaikokujin, Knott and another Englishman Edward Divers, Pro fessor of Chemistry, remained.75 The Physics Department consisted of two full Professors of Physics, Knott and Yamagawa Kenjiro, one Assistant Professor, Tanakadate Aikitsu, and one Lecturer, Muraoka Han'ichi. In 1888, when Tanakadate left for the University of Glasgow to study elec tricity and magnetism under William Thomson, Nagaoka Hantaro, then a graduate student, was invited to take over Tanakadate's duties while he was abroad. In 1890 Nagaoka was promoted to Assistant Professor of Physics, and in 1891 Tanakadate, returning from abroad after three years of study, was promoted to Professor of Physics to replace Knott who left Japan the same year.76 Knott was one of the last of the oyatoi gaikokujin. Mendenhall and Ewing Of the foreign scientists, Mendenhall and Ewing were especially impor tant for Japanese physics. Mendenhall, born in Ohio, had never received a formal higher education. He had studied science on his own and had taught in high schools when, in 1873, he was invited to teach physics and me chanics at Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Ohio State University). He was invited to Japan on the recommendation of E. Morse, one of the oyatoi gaikokujin. Mendenhall taught physics and directed the laboratory work of students majoring in chemistry and physics at the University of Tokyo. In training the physics students, he did not limit the laboratory experiments to mere repetitions of known experiments. To gether with his students, he measured the force of gravity in Tokyo, and in 1880 he took his students to the top of Mt. Fuji to determine the density of the earth. A year later, after he had left, his students carried out 74Hiraoka Morisaburo was born Ichikawa Morisaburo; he was adopted into the Hiraoka family in 1875. See J.

Besides these scientists at the University of Tokyo, there were a number of oyatoi gaikokujin at the engineering school. When Kobu Daigakko was erected in 1873, all eleven of the faculty members were oyatoi gaikokujin. After the institution became the College of Engineering at the Imperial University, only three out of twenty-two faculty members were foreigners: two pro fessors and one lecturer.

In the years that followed, similar experiments were carried out all over Japan and formed an important part of Japanese scientific activity. Although Mendenhall spent less than three years in Japan, his influence on Japanese physicists was great: he was the first professor of physics' at the University of Tokyo (the earlier physics professors had been in the French Language Physics Department), and he initiated experimental geophysical research that his students, especially Tanakadate Aikitsu, continued.77 Ewing was born in Dundee, Scotland. He was a graduate of the Uni versity of Edinburgh, where he studied engineering under Fleeming Jenkin. Jenkin, who together with William Thomson was in the business of manu facturing and installing submarine telegraph cables, recommended Ewing for a position on three cable-laying expeditions in South America. In 1877 Ewing accepted a professorship in mechanical engineering at the University of Tokyo, where he taught such subjects as mechanical engineering and heat engines to engineering students, and mechanics, electricity, and mag netism to physics students. However, it was through activities outside teaching, especially through his research in magnetism and seismology, that Ewing exercised most influence on Japanese physicists. The physics stu dents working under him, in particular Tanakadate Aikitsu, Fujisawa Rikitaro, Tanaka Shohei, and Sakai Saho, participated in his research on magnetism, conducting graduate experiments that were related to his hysteresis investigations. Although Ewing's contributions to hysteresis were largely rediscoveries of phenomena studied earlier by such physicists as Kohlrausch, Fromme, Cohn, Stoletow, Rowland, and Warburg,78 he and his students carried out their experiments without knowing the work of their predecessors. By allowing his students to aid him in his experi ments, Ewing gave them invaluable experience and training; he also made it possible for them to gain the confidence that the Japanese could make 77M.

Tanaka date expressed his gratitude to Mendanhall and Ewing for taking the initia tive among the oyatoi physics teachers in encouraging students to partici pate in their researches and for showing their students that their researches contributed to science in a fundamental way.79 Like Mendenhall's, Ewing's research on magnetism was continued and developed, though on a small scale and by only one of his students, Tana kadate. In 1888 Nagaoka Hantar?", one of the younger graduate students, also began related research on magnetism under Knott's influence, building on the groundwork Ewing had laid earlier. Nagaoka applied himself vigor ously to experiments related to the study of magnetostriction, and as a re sult was invited to report on magnetostriction at the First Physics Inter national Congress held in Paris in 1900.80 One of Nagaoka's students, Honda Kotaro, in turn carried on Nagaoka's investigations, moving grad ually on to the study of ferromagnetic substances, and playing a crucial role in the development of metallurgy in Japan. Mendenhall and Ewing initiated two different types of physical research that became institutionalized in Japanese physics. The research initiated by Mendenhall, namely, measurements of the force of gravity and terrestial magnetism in various parts of Japan, had local significance. By contrast, Ewing's work had universal significance for the properties of matter. Mendenhall's field activity and Ewing's laboratory activity represented different approaches to the conduct of physics. These two approaches were transmitted by the oyatoi gatkokujin to the Department of Physics and both continued to be developed by their students. The Faculty of Science and the Development of Physics T. Hiroshige has pointed out that the Faculty of Science at its birth in 1877 was oriented toward engineering and the practical.81 The structure of the Faculty of Science, indeed the orientation of the University itself, tended to favor sciences that were useful in solving practical problems facing the nation. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry were combined to make up one department, whereas engineering and geology-mining consti tuted separate departments. The practical orientation is also apparent in some of the arguments that emerged when the University curriculum was 79S. Nakamura, Tanakadate Aikitsu sensei, p. 70. 80H.

One was that as long as the institution bore the name "University," it ought to base its curriculum on that of Western universities and provide advanced studies to train scholars. The other was that in view of the practical problems Japan faced at the time, the University should establish a curriculum that was simple and useful to the Japanese people. Both opinions had shortcomings, and in the end the school officials decided to combine them in a curriculum that required each department to offer both pure and applied studies.82 The emphasis on applied subjects, however, does not sufficiently explain the apparent slighting of mathematics, physics, and astronomy in assigning the three subjects to one department. Tanakadate, recalling his days as a student in the department, says that the three subjects had been combined because University officials were concerned about the future careers of students. They worried that a student majoring in only one of the subjects, say physics, might not be able to find a job directly related to it after graduation.83 At the same time, physics was taught in both the chemistry and the engineering departments to first- and second-year students. The explanation is that the Japanese thought it less significant to pursue the discipline of physics in its own right than to use it as a tool in other disci plines. The subsequent development of physics shows how it emerged as an autonomous discipline. In the curriculum of 1877 there was still almost no difference between the programs for students of either mathematics, physics, or astronomy; by 1880 students were required to choose one of the fields as a major in their sophomore year. Physics students were re quired to take analytical chemistry but were not required to take pure mathematics or astronomy. A year later, when mathematics, physics, and astronomy were made into independent departments, pure mathematics and astronomy became requirements for physics students. The next great changes took place in 1886: the University of Tokyo be came the Imperial University, the Faculty of Science changed its name to the College of Science, and the School of the Ministry of Engineering was absorbed by the Imperial University as the College of Engineering. The engineering departments of the old science faculty were transferred to the College of Engineering, and for the first time the study of science in Japan became independent of the study of engineering. This did not mean, how ever, that science was to be studied for its own sake, free from all practical considerations. As indicated in the 1886 Ordinance, the Imperial Uni versity was to be useful to the nation; like all other researchers and edu *2Ibid.} p. 471. 83 A.

During the same year, 1886, graduate programs were established in each College, making the Imperial University the first institution in Japan capable of conducting advanced research. The University became the country's main center of academic and research activity in science; it remained so even after the establishment in 1897 of a second Imperial University in Kyoto. Turning to the production of trained physicists, we find that between 1878 and 1880 twenty men graduated from the old French Language Physics Department. The Mathematics-Physics-Astronomy Department of the University of Tokyo produced its first three graduates in physics in 1882, trained by men like Mendenhall, Ewing, and Yamagawa. From 1883 to 1892 there were one to three graduates each year, and from 1893 on there were six to ten each year (except in 1895, when there was only one graduate).84 Derek Price, in his Little Science, Big Science, gives some statistics about Japanese physicists on the basis of E. Yagi's study. He plots various curves, one giving the change in the number of Western physicists invited to Japan and of Japanese trained in the West; another shows the first generation of physicists trained in Japan, i.e., the students of those in the first curve; and a third gives the figures for second- and third-generation Japanese physi cists trained in Japan by Japanese physicists. On the basis of these curves, Price concludes that "there was a lag of nearly 20 years while the second generation [which grew in exponential fashion from 1894 to World War II] prepared. It seems important that the steady state arose only with this crop of entirely home-grown physicists."85 His study is revealing, but since it is based entirely upon the statistics of University of Tokyo graduates, it shows only part of the total picture. The Tokyo School of Physics Although the Imperial University was the center for physics research and teaching in Japan during the last decades of the nineteenth century, physics was also taught at a private institution, the Tokyo Butsuri K?sh?sho, or Tokyo Physics Training School, founded in 1881. This insti tution, which two years later was renamed Tokyo Butsuri Gakko, or Tokyo School of Physics, represented another side of physics education in Japan. Its contribution has been largely overshadowed by that of the pres Tokyo teitoku daigaku sotsugyDsei shimeiroku (Tokyo, 1926), pp. 283-285. 85D.

Until 1907 it was the only private institution in Japan that taught Western science; its primary aim was to train science teachers for Japanese secondary schools. The circumstances that led to the founding of this school deserve close attention. The school came into existence because some of the former students of the French Language Physics Department of the University of Tokyo wanted to expose the Japanese public to the principles of the physical sciences. The Japanese were then very much involved in politics and generally with the future of Japan. Law and political science were the main concern of youth, and consequently educational institutions, both governmental and private, emphasizing such disciplines flourished. In spired by such institutional activity and by a concern for Japan's future, a group of young physicists felt compelled to publicize the study of science. At first they planned a public lecture series on science reminiscent of the popular lectures on science given throughout France by former students of the Ecole polytechnique in the 1820's and by the members of Auguste Comte's "Association Polytechnique" of the 1830's and 1840's.86 At that time, however, there was considerable political turmoil;87 the Free Rights Movement was at its height and was pressing for the immediate establish ment of a Diet or Congress, and laws had been enacted to prevent this movement from getting out of hand. Policemen, teachers, and government officials were forbidden to meet in groups in public. Since most of the French-language physicists had become either teachers or government officials, their request for the lecture series was denied, despite its non political nature. Frustrated, they decided after long, serious discussions to create a school through which they could educate the public in the physi cal sciences and mathematics. Of the twenty-one founders of the Tokyo School of Physics, nineteen were graduates of the French Language Physics Department of the Uni versity of Tokyo, and the remaining two had studied there. Since six of the twenty-one founders were not in Tokyo when the school was set up, the actual teaching was carried on by the other fifteen. The faculty members received no compensation for their labors; they worked at their respective professions during the day and taught at the school at night.88 86H.

They rented a room in a primary school, and they borrowed apparatus from their alma mater, the Faculty of Science at the University of Tokyo. Despite initial small successes that made it possible for them to build a small schoolhouse and to add mathematics and chem istry to the original physics program, they eventually faced a serious finan cial setback. When the school was inaugurated, there were about twenty students in attendance, but because the teachers were inexperienced and the teaching schedule was poorly managed, the number of students de creased until at one point only one student remained. Serious discussions about the future of the school followed, in which some of the teachers proposed that the school be terminated. In 1885 they drew up a formal document outlining the measures they were to take to save the school. Each faculty member was to pledge an immediate donation of money to the school. He was further to agree to teach two nights a week or pay a fine if he failed to appear. Sixteen of the original twenty-one founders signed the pledge; one of the original twenty-one had died, two had earlier left the group, and two declined to sign for financial reasons. As a result of these stringent measures and the continuous efforts of the teachers, the school survived its most difficult years, and by 1887 it was able to balance its budget through the income from tuition.89 At the end of that year the school graduated its first student from what was then a one-year course. That same year the faculty extended the curriculum to two years, and eight years later, in 1893, they extended it to three years. The number of graduates was very small through 1888, but from 1889 to 1903 it in creased to between twenty and thirty a year, with the exception of two smaller classes in 1892 and 1893.90 During these years, there were two hundred to five hundred students attending the school, most of whom therefore did not complete the course. %9Ibid., pp. 16-26; and Z.

Since the opening of Japan, various Western systems of measurement had been brought in and used together with traditional Japanese systems. Government officials and scientists worked to resolve the resulting confusion until weights and measures were standardized by law in 1891. Thus there was an immediate need for people familiar with the new system of weights and measures. For this reason a new program was temporarily created at the Tokyo School of Physics; two years later it was terminated. During the two years sixty-eight persons graduated.</page><page sequence="41">42 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS The school offered three courses of study: a major in mathematics, one in physics and chemistry, and a double major combining the two. Among those who graduated, very few were physics and chemistry majors; most concentrated either on mathematics or selected the curriculum combining mathematics with physics and chemistry. In 1930 statistics were gathered on the postgraduate careers of the students; they revealed that out of 1,878 graduates, 1,056, or more than fifty percent, had become secon dary school science teachers. The rest had become businessmen, public officials, or had taken other jobs.91 Ogura Kinnosuke suggests that the large number of secondary school teachers among the graduates can be explained by the large proportion of the school's teachers who were them selves involved in secondary school education as their main occupation. He further points out that although education at the Tokyo School of Physics was not designed specifically to qualify students for the teachers' licensing examinations, students tended to view the school as a means to that end rather than as a place for gaining a profound understanding of science 92 per se. The Tokyo School of Physics had similarities with a religious movement. The founders were motivated and behaved as if they were missionaries of science, and despite difficult years they more or less succeeded in their mission. The large numbers of Japanese youths who responded to the founders' efforts are an indication that at that time the Japanese?both the founders of the school and the people in general?willingly answered the demands of a new age.

Similarly the importation of Western civilization, particularly of science and technology, was carried out as part of the policy of the Meiji government. The establishment of a national university was an official act aimed at bringing to the Japanese people a knowledge of various Western techniques and ideas. Foreign experts were brought into the Uni versity of Tokyo and into other government institutions at great expense. All of these efforts were initiated not by the people but by the govern ment. Nonetheless, people from all levels of society, rather than displaying indifference to a remote government's initiatives, responded in their own way. It was the mission of the University of Tokyo to educate Japanese scien tists to a level of competence equivalent to that of their Western counter parts, so that they could replace the foreign specialists and continue their work. The mission of the Tokyo School of Physics, however, was quite different. It was in no way motivated by the desire to advance research in physics, but solely by the desire to spread a knowledge of the physical sciences to the population at large as a service to society. The University of Tokyo and the Tokyo School of Physics differed in their positions and in their functions in society. The University of Tokyo had the best of everything; it had the best teachers, students, and equip ment in Japan, and, more important, it had the full backing of the govern ment. Those who taught there and those who graduated from there were the nation's elite. The Tokyo School of Physics was not comparable in any sense. The teachers were inexperienced, and since they had been among the earliest graduates from the University of Tokyo, they had re ceived a kind of transitional or intermediary education consisting of a mixture of astronomy, meteorology, mathematics, and electrical engineer ing. Products of the soon defunct French Language Physics Department, they did not succeed in becoming active physicists. The two institutions differed most, however, in the level of student ability. Anyone with a rough understanding of arithmetic and the ability to take lecture notes was admitted to the Tokyo School of Physics. Unlike the University of Tokyo, the school did not require students to pass an entrance examination or to study a foreign language. Needless to say, the facilities and equipment were poor. The success of two such different institutions illustrates the magnitude of change that Japan was undergoing: people of all strata in society were responding to the modernization process initiated by the Meiji government</page><page sequence="43">44 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS by assuming technical or scientific tasks. They not only imported science but domesticated it, making it a vital and natural part of the Japanese social order. The new society developed in such a way that not only the elite who graduated from the University of Tokyo but the common citi zens who graduated from the Tokyo School of Physics could also play a useful role. The Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society The establishment in 1884 of the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society (Tokyo S?gaku Butsuri Gakkai), an enlargement of the Tokyo Mathemati cal Society (Tokyo S?gaku Kaisha), also contributed to the institutionaliza tion of physics in Japan. The Tokyo Mathematical Society had been formed in 1877 by two mathematicians, Kanda Takahira and Yanagi Narayoshi, and had a regular membership of fifty-five. Almost all members were mathematicians; they included specialists in wasan mathematics, in Western mathematics, and in both. A few of the original members such as Muraoka Han'ichi and Terao Hisashi were physicists who had been trained in German or French.93 The aim of the Tokyo Mathematical Society was to promote mathematics through activities such as the creation of a mathe matical archive, the translation of Western mathematical treatises into Japanese, the circulation of mathematical problems for solution, and the publication of a journal.94 The society was not rigorously structured; its original bylaws contained only six articles regulating membership, fees, and the publication of the journal.95 In 1880 the society recognized that inadequate bylaws and poor financing had created a situation in which the society was not only failing to develop as expected, but was actually de clining. The resulting twenty-six formal regulations that were drawn up to replace the original six added astronomy and surveying as disciplines to be promoted by the society, revised the financing, and placed admissions under a new tight control that required all new members to have the sponsorship of an old one.96 The new regulations resolved the difficulties and injected new life into the society. The members elected new officers, asked certain members to assume responsibility for specific fields of mathematics so as to answer the questions and problems that were pre 93Tokyo s?gaku butsurigakkai kiji (hereafter abbreviated TSBGK), 1 (1885), 3. 94See K.

The monthly meetings and monthly journal continued as before. At the same time, a basic change was taking place in the membership of the society. In its formative years it was comprised of people of varying backgrounds?navy and army officers, government officials, and school teachers?and of mathematicians representing both wasan and Western mathematics. This diversity in the backgrounds and interests of the mem bers gradually vanished as the society became dominated by people who were or had been connected with the University of Tokyo. The change was inevitable because the University of Tokyo was almost the only source of recruitment for an academic society, and because the new restrictions re quiring sponsored admissions tended to limit new admissions to the stu dents or colleagues of old members. In 1884 Kikuchi Dairoku, then the Professor of Mathematics at the Uni versity of Tokyo, initiated a proposal to include the promotion of physics among the activities of the society. Kikuchi, an active member of the society, was one of the twelve officials responsible for academic disciplines and the journal, and was the society's specialist on mechanics and solid analytical geometry. He had been instrumental in ending inefficient figure head administration in the society by abolishing the presidency, a move that was interpreted as an effort to purge the society of officers who sup ported traditional wasan mathematics. Kikuchi may also have been the member who persuaded the society to move its monthly meetings to the University of Tokyo. In his proposal to include the discipline of physics in the society, Kikuchi emphasized what he considered to be the still inade quate quality of the Tokyo Mathematical Society. He argued that to im prove the society just as to improve Japanese science it was necessary to expand the sphere of activities in Western science. In forming the Tokyo Mathematical Society mathematicians had acknowledged this need, but they had not yet succeeded in satisfying it. Kikuchi proposed the new Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society specifically as a means to improve the quality of the Tokyo Mathematical Society, not just to enlarge it. Physics and mathematics, he argued, are closely related; to master physics one must master advanced mathematics, and to master mathematics one must seek to apply it in physics. Because physics and mathematics depend on each other, Western academic societies and journals combine the two disciplines. He concluded that since we already have several physicists in our society, and since the current state of science does not permit a</page><page sequence="45">46 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS society of only one discipline to flourish, it is both natural and necessary for the success of our society to promote the study of both.97 Kikuchi's proposal was approved unanimously by the members of the society.98 Whether Kikuchi's motion was political or purely academic, we cannot say; but with hindsight we can see that the move to include physics was indeed necessary for the survival of the society. Both its restricted membership and its dependence on the University of Tokyo as the sole producer of mathematicians had brought the society to an almost zero growth rate. Without the combined forces of both physicists and mathe maticians the society probably would have died out. Outside the society, Japanese physicists had come together on at least one project. A committee for the establishment of equivalents in Japanese for Western physical terms had been formed in 1883 under the leadership of Yamagawa Kenjiro, then Professor of Physics at the University of Tokyo. The translation of Western scientific terms was a horrendous task because science had been brought into Japan and studied through several European languages more or less simultaneously. Up to 1878 "physics," an entirely new concept to the Japanese, had appeared in at least five different translations: kakuchigaku, kakubutsugaku, ky?rigaku, rigaku, and butsurigaku. To add to the resulting confusion these expressions were sometimes used interchangeably in the same book, and the Japanese trans lator's task was further complicated by the existence of two expressions in English, namely, "physics" and "natural philosophy," for the same field of study. By 1878 all but one of the terms had dropped out of use; butsurigaku, which means the study of the underlying reasons behind, or principles of, matter or things, became the standard Japanese word for physics. Still, the confusion continued with respect to other terms. In 1880 the mathematician Nakagawa Masayuki came out strongly for unified translations in his field; soon engineers, chemists, and physicists pressed for similar agreement. When setting up his committee on physical terms, Yamagawa drew not only on physicists but on chemists, mathematicians, and engineers as well.99 Part of the working procedure of the committee, of which little is known, was to select three foreign language specialists in English, German, and French, respectively, and to have them draft equivalents; their recom mendations were voted on at the full committee meetings that were held ^Ibid., pp. 89-90. 98/bi'd., p. 92. "NKGT, 1, 547.</page><page sequence="46">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 47 twice a month.100 Tanakadate Aikitsu, then Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Tokyo, recalls the disagreement over the Japanese equivalent of "energy": some committee members argued that since the concept of energy is extremely important in the study of physics it should be translated into Japanese; others argued exactly the opposite; namely, that it is such an important term that it should not be translated, but adopted as is. The committee finally decided to leave it untranslated, transcribing it phonetically into Japanese as enerugi.101 They completed the first draft of a dictionary, Butsurigakujutsugo waeifutsudoku taiyaku jisho (Japanese Dictionary of Physics Terminology from English, French, and German), in three years and published the work in 1888. The meetings of the committee had great significance for Japanese physicists. There they could discuss the different scientific terminology in different languages, clarify the ambiguities inherent in these terms, and draft a dictionary which would give Japanese scientists a tool to help them think, discuss, and write about physics in Japanese. The work of the com mittee also reveals that the physicists had a leader to organize such meet ings and that there was cohesiveness among physicists despite the extra ordinary differences in their physics education. It appears that the physi cists could easily have formed their own academic society; there are no documents to explain why they did not. Physicists responded eagerly to Kikuchi's proposal for broadening the conception of the mathematical society. Three physicists were voted to membership in May 1884, the same month the proposal was approved, seven more in June, four in July, and another five in September.102 After adopting its new name, the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society set out to reshape itself and establish new regulations. Admission requirements were raised further. The society's journal was changed from a monthly publication to one that was to come out "at least three times a year." Aside from making certain members responsible for business matters and editing the journal, the society appointed ten members to report on foreign scientific journals at the monthly meetings, four on English journals, three on French, and three on German.103 In contrast to the Tokyo Mathematical Society, the new Tokyo Mathe matico-Physical Society of 1884 emphasized specialization; it reflected its l00Ibid., p. 548. 101 A.

The more academic and specialized the new society became, the more it became a closed society that was increasingly dependent on the University of Tokyo. In October 1884, a few months after the founding of the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society, thirty of the eighty-two members were connected with the University of Tokyo; of the members who attended the monthly meetings half had University affiliation. By the following year, the percentage of academics had increased so much that the monthy meetings were dominated by members from the University.104 A second major characteristic of the new society was the extent of its reporting on foreign scientific journals. In short while the society became restricted and closed domestically at the turn of the century, it remained open to the West, eager to absorb whatever was available in print from scientists abroad. 4. THE FIRST GENERATION OF JAPANESE PHYSICISTS: THE 1870's Japan's First Physicists Although physics emerged in Japan less than a hundred years ago, the names of all but the most famous of the first generation of Japanese physicists and all data on them are already hard to discover. One good source of names is the Japanese Dictionary of Physics Terminology from English, French, and German of 1888. The dictionary does not provide the names of all physicists in the 1880's?for example, six graduates of the French Language Physics Department at the University of Tokyo were not included?but it does list the persons who were considered active physicists at that time. In a study of early Japanese physicists, Yagi Eri has attempted to classify some of the physicists listed in the Dictionary by the language through which they learned physics.105 Yagi's classification, however, has short comings that produce peculiar groupings. She has a French-language group all of whom studied in Japan, and a German-language group all of whom studied in Germany;106 her English group is composed of those who studied in America and those who studied physics in English in Japan. Two l0*Ibtd., 3, 1-3, 119-138. 105E. Yagi, "Nihon saisho no butsurigakusha tachi," Butsungakushi kenky?, 1 (1959), 237-262. 106This includes Strasbourg, which from 1871 to 1918 belonged to Germany.</page><page sequence="48">K.ENKJCHIRO KOIZUMI 49 other groups are not language groups at all, nor are they made up of physicists; one is made up of engineers, irrespective of language, the other of yogakusha, of scholars of Western studies in a general sense, all of whom studied in Japan, mainly in English. Even the groups based purely on language present problems because, al though most of the dictionary's compilers were physicists, not all were; some of the language groups such as the English group that was trained abroad contain only one physicist, a category that can hardly be called a group. The German group should have been divided into the one man who was trained abroad and the rest who were trained in Japan but later studied in Germany. Perhaps the one interesting phenomenon Yagi observed is that those who had studied physics through English dominated the Physics Department at the Imperial University, but those who had studied physics through Ger man became faculty members only in the College of Agriculture or College of Medicine of the University. The reason for this, no doubt, was that English by that time had become the official language of the Physics De partment, whereas in the Colleges of Agriculture and Medicine, German was the primary language. Of those who had trained through French in the early French Language Physics Department, most became high school teachers or government employees; one became a member of the Astron omy Department at the University of Tokyo; and a very few joined the Physics Department as assistant professors, but were never promoted to professor and ultimately went elsewhere.107 It is more significant for a history of physics in Japan to define the char acteristics common to the first-generation physicists as a group and then to point out the distinctions between them and the physicists who came later than to divide them by language groups. The first generation was composed of some twenty-seven physicists. For some of these we know only their names and nothing at all of their careers. The twenty-one for whom data exist are given in Table D (Appendix). The sudden emergence in the late 1870's and early 1880's of such a sub stantial group of physicists is remarkable both in its own right and in its contrast with the situation that existed in the late 1880's. After the initial 107E. Yagi, op. ext. (note 105), pp. 242, 246, and 252. In the case of chemists in Japan, those who studied chemistry through English or German had almost identical careers to the physicists mentioned above. There were no chemists, however, who had studied through French, although a number had studied through Dutch and were naturally older than those whose language was English or German. See K. Sugawara, "Meiji shoki no kagakusha tachi (1859-1880)," Butsurigakushi kenky?, 6 (1970), 1-25.</page><page sequence="49">50 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS group, no clearly identifiable groups or blocks of physicists were pro duced; rather, the first group was followed by a more or less regular se quence of a few physicists a year who had remarkably uniform training and who, with a few exceptions, left no particular mark on the develop ment of Japanese physics. From the late 1880's the discipline of physics was established, the curriculum stabilized, and the educational machinery firmly installed and running smoothly. The first generation of Japanese physicists was born in the 1850's, which means that they experienced in their youth one of the periods of most rapid change in Japanese history. Instead of turning their backs on the changing situation, as some Japanese did, they eagerly sought new values. Another common characteristic of the group is that they came from samurai families and thus shared a strong background in Chinese studies.108 In order to understand the significance of this background, it is necessary to understand the nature of the samurai education these men had received before they studied physics. I will give a brief outline of this large subject. The Education of a Samurai Two aspects of the education of a samurai are relevant here: the curric ulum itself, including the teaching methods, and the philosophical con cepts upon which the educational process was based. The scientific education of Japan's first physicists was built upon a foundation comprising both these aspects. The two skills considered fundamental to Western ele mentary education, writing and arithmetic, were not a part of a formal samurai education; their pursuit was beneath his dignity. Writing in Japa nese was thought too easy a task to aid in the development of self-disci pline, which was one of the main purposes of Japanese education, and, in any case, the vernacular literature for centuries had been considered a matter for women. Arithmetic calculation for monetary or other material istic purposes was a crass occupation suited to merchants rather than the elite. Sometimes schools did not even bother to teach these subjects, so that the samurai often had to acquire writing skills in his native language, i.e., in calligraphy, and arithmetic outside the fief schools, either at home c ' 109 or rrom a private tutor. 108Probably all were samurai but the official record is unclear in one or two cases. What is known of their education indicates that even if the latter were not officially samurai, they had been educated as such. 109R. P. Dore, Education in Tokugawa Japan (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1965), p. 126.</page><page sequence="50">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 51 The traditional curriculum for a samurai of the Tokugawa period con sisted primarily in the study of the Chinese Confucian classics, in lessons on how to conduct himself on all occasions according to his station in life, and in the mastery of various military arts such as swordsmanship, riding, archery, and strategy. After entering the fief school at the age of six or seven, a young samurai devoted the next seven years of his educational life almost entirely to rote memorization of Chinese philosophical texts. Mili tary training usually did not begin until a samurai was eleven to thirteen years old. The object of reading Chinese philosophy was not to analyze or criticize the text or even -for the first few years?to understand it, but to make it one's own. The educational process was designed to tame childish inclinations to haste and superficiality. Although it was extremely boring and difficult for young samurai, no other training was deemed as effective in producing strict physical and mental self-control or in curbing impetuous curiosity. The Japanese practice of reading Chinese Confucian texts resem bles religious methods of achieving discipline. Normally the samurai had to master the "reading" of five major Con fucian classics?which he did by the age of thirteen or fourteen?before his teacher discussed their content or meaning. Even then the texts were pre sented dogmatically, not debated or interpreted. The student was asked to accept that all necessary explications had already been made by later Chi nese philosophers and that only in extraordinary cases had outstanding Japanese scholars written commentaries to Chinese works.110 Another reason for the emphasis on classical Chinese in samurai educa tion was that, although the Japanese had a rich and ancient tradition of belle lettres written in Japanese, almost all works on history, medicine, astronomy, law, and military strategy were in Chinese -the Latin of East Asia. Indeed the first works on Western science reached Japan through Chinese translations or through texts written in Chinese by the Jesuits. When the samurai completed his study of the Confucian classics and pro ceeded to higher learning at the age of fourteen or fifteen, he would ac quire it through Chinese texts no matter what subject he pursued. The close connection between Japanese higher learning and a foreign language, i.e., Chinese, molded Japanese attitudes toward the process of acquiring knowledge. Since its introduction via Buddhist scriptures in the fifth century, at a time when the Japanese had no written script of their own, Chinese had been the vehicle for transmitting "learning," and it re 110Ib?d., p. 133.</page><page sequence="51">52 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS mained so even after the Japanese created a script for their own vernacular and used it in their poetry and creative literature. Chinese writing and even the content of learned works were conspicuously non-Japanese; the Japa nese intellectual became used to the idea that the source and the language of learning were foreign. R. P. Dore writes of the "alienness of Chinese studies" and says it "lends force to the argument that the Japanese were more easily able than the Chinese to exchange the Confucian for the West ern world-view in that Confucianism was still for them only a 'suit of bor bowed clothes'."111 Although the Confucian worldview was perhaps easier to shed than a natively conceived one, there was another, more positive factor influencing the Japanese attitude toward Western studies. That Confucian studies were foreign meant that for centuries, despite geograph ical and political isolation, the Japanese recognized that knowledge prized by the governing class could and did come from beyond her borders. Equally important as the source, content, and vehicle of Chinese studies was their purpose; education had both a moral and a vocational goal. Schools taught the samurai the full extent of his duty to his lord and molded him into a loyal and useful servant and good administrator. In the seventeenth century Kaibara Ekken gave one of the simplest and most intelligible explanations of the Confucian worldview, of man's place in that world, and of the role education played in it.112 The Confucian world centers on tenchi, which is a physical heaven, an anthropomorphic deity, and a physical and ethical "natural law." Tenchi is the creator of the uni verse, and man is the favored progeny because he is endowed with mind, heart, and the five virtues of kindness, justice, wisdom, trustworthiness, and a knowledge of proper social conduct. Out of gratitude from being selected to be born a man rather than any of the other 10,000 life forms, man is under obligation to tenchi to devote his life to cultivating to its highest level of perfection his tenchi-given nature. His five virtues are con stantly threatened by natural appetites and materialism. To fight these threats, man models his conduct on that of the ancient Chinese sages who left the classics as a guide to succeeding generations. It is each man's duty to learn the Chinese classics as a precondition for a virtuous life; a success ful education is marked not by knowledge, but by virtuous conduct. Other scholars, including the founders of rival schools of Japanese Confucian thought, defined the Confucian worldview in different terms, but their ll?Ibid., p. 137, note 1. 112E.

The samurai's duty was not only to the powers of the universe that created him, but to the state as well. To be a samurai was to be a member of the governing elite; good government depended upon the proper moral training of those who were to govern; moral training, there fore, was occupational training. Whether moral or practical values were emphasized, both elementary and advanced study always implied training in self-discipline to achieve a higher moral nature rather than the acquisi tion of pure knowledge; samurai education was oriented toward an end that would serve the state. Education in the Tokugawa period was not conducive to innovation; rather it consisted in the passive absorption and transmission of tradition. To open new fields of knowledge was not part of scholarly activity; even to pronounce new interpretations of the Chinese classics was heresy and was severely criticized and even prohibited. Needless to say, a learning activity that consisted of man's search to satisfy his curiosity about his environment was not worthy of pursuit. Like all samurai, Japan's first physicists had received Confucian educa tions: they had been trained in the Chinese classics until they were about fifteen. Then they were chosen to pursue Western studies in Japan or abroad, rather than following the usual course of higher learning in Chi nese. Foreign and Domestic Training The institution that is of greatest importance to the history of early physics in Japan is the Southern Division, in existence from 1870 until the merger in 1877 that produced the University of Tokyo. The Southern Division was the first school under the Meiji government that was given the responsibility of educating large numbers of students in Western stud ies. The original plan called for a thousand students to enter in 1870, the first year, at least half of whom were to come from the fiefs in numbers proportional to their sizes. The fiefs sent about three hundred students the first year. The course of study was to extend over five years; applicants had to be between sixteen and twenty.113 The latter requirement is impor tant to note, since it means that most matriculating students were born in the 1850's and were of the same generation as the first physicists. It also means they had already completed their elementary Confucian training. The problems involved in inviting students from the fiefs were so great that the system collapsed a year after it began. In July 1871 the Southern U3-JTDG, 1, 147-149.</page><page sequence="53">54 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Division closed temporarily and all students were dismissed. By October 1871 the Southern Division had reopened, readmitting the students who had been doing well when the school closed.114 Among those readmitted, we find seven115 of the twenty students who graduated from the French Language Physics Department of the University of Tokyo in 1878-1880. They had survived the University's false starts and transitions during its opening years as it changed from the Southern Division to the Tokyo Kaisei School to the University of Tokyo; they had also survived the 1873 decision to change the instructional language to English. Instead of the originally planned five years of study they had undergone an eight- to ten year course in a constantly shifting science curriculum. At the same time that the Southern Division was established and students were sought from the fiefs, a policy encouraging study abroad was adopted and was another influence on the careers of some of the first generation of physicists.116 In 1870 Kitao Jiro (or Diro, as he preferred to spell his name), one of the first students at the Southern Division, was sent from there to Germany, and the next year Yamagawa Kenjiro was sent to America from his fief in Aizu, the only one of the first-generation physi cists to study there. The English-Language Physicists Yamagawa and Tanakadate became the most famous of the first genera tion of physicists. That both men studied physics through English and later taught at the Imperial Univeristy points up the importance of first-genera tion English-language physicists in Japan. The other two English4anguage physicists on the first-generation list had little impact on the physics disci pline. Ichikawa Morisaburo (who changed his name to Hiraoka) became Professor of Physics at the University of Tokyo in 1880, but he died two years later at the age of thirty at the very beginning of his career. Goto Makita was a somewhat unusual case. He studied at Keio University, a pri vate school founded by the social philosopher and scholar of Western studies Fukuzawa Yukichi, who had exerted such influence on the educa tional policy of the early Meiji period. Goto, therefore, had been trained in nHbid., p. 151. 115The seven were Kobayashi, K. Nakamura, Sakurai, Samejima, Sembon, and Yatabe. Nothing beyond their names is known about Kobayashi and Samejima.

Although he was technically a physicist and even did postgraduate work in physics at the Universities of Glasgow and Man chester, Goto was more an educator than a physicist, and like his mentor, Fukuzawa, he became a popularizer of his field, writing many articles for the general public on such topics as the elementary principles of elec 117 tncity. The German-Language Physicists Despite the importance of the official use of English to the development of the discipline of physics and the ultimate fame of two out of the four English-language physicists in the first generation of physicists, the German language physicists, too, had an impact on the University, if not on the Physics Department directly. As in the English group, there were four physicists in the German group, of whom one had studied abroad and three had started their studies in Japan. Kitao, the first of the students of the Southern Division to be selected in 1870 to go abroad to Germany with government support, stayed fourteen years and married a German. He studied first at the University of Berlin, then at the University of G?ttingen where he received a Ph.D. in physics, and finally returned to Berlin to re sume his research under Hermann von Helmholtz. His research in Germany probably dealt with hydrodynamics and optics; for he devised an optical instrument called a Leukoskop which was used to test color blindness, and after his return to Japan he wrote a famous series of papers on the dynam ics of typhoons.118 By the time he had returned to Japan, however, the Physics Department at the Imperial University had adopted English as its official language, so that despite his extensive training abroad he was un able to obtain a position there. He became instead Professor of Physics in the Agriculture Department, where German was a language of instruction. Of the other three German-language physicists, Muraoka was the most successful. He entered the Southern Division in 1870, the year it was 117M. Fukushima, "Goto Makita?Meiji kaikaki no rika kyoiku," Butsurigakushi kenky?, 6 (1970), 1-35. 118K.

Al though he survived the initial readjustments when English became the of ficial language in 1873, he was in effect shut out in 1875 when the univer sity cancelled the German Chemistry Department, its last concession to its earlier students who had the misfortune to start their careers in German. Finding employment with the Ministry of Education, he continued to study physics on his own and did part-time physics teaching at Joshi Shihan Gakk?, the Women's Teachers' College. In 1878 the Ministry of Education sent him to Strasbourg to study educational administration; dur ing his four years there he graduated from the Strasbourg Teachers' College and earned a B.S. in physics from the University of Strasbourg. After re turning to Japan in 1881 he became a lecturer in physics in the Medical Department, in which German was used, of the University of Tokyo, and in 1883 he was promoted to Professor of Physics in that department. In 1886 when the University of Tokyo became the Imperial University, Muraoka also began to lecture in the Physics Department, the only German language physicist of the first generation to do so. Muraoka became well known as an educator; he wrote many articles on physics education in pri mary and secondary schools, and in 1896 he became Professor of Physics in the Science-Engineering Department of the newly established Kyoto Imperial University.119 Shiga Taizan had begun German studies in 1872 when the Southern Division was called The First Middle School of the First University. He apparently failed to survive the language change and dropped out to teach physics at Tokyo Shihan Gakko (Tokyo Teachers' College). In 1884 he taught physics at Diagaku Yobimon (The University Gateway School), a preparatory school for the University of Tokyo. Possibly he also worked for the Ministry of Education and Commerce at that time. He was sent to Germany in 1885 where he concentrated his studies on agriculture and forestry, and upon his return to Japan he worked for the government, be coming an official of rank by 1890. In the same year he was also appointed Professor of Agriculture at the College of Agriculture at the Imperial Uni versity. Shiga is listed as a physicist because he began as a teacher of phys ics and wrote elementary books on physics and science for lower school students; he spent the later part of his career almost completely outside the physics discipline.120 Iimori Teizo (or lhmori as he preferred to spell his name), the last of the 119E.

He had begun his study of German at a government institution called Tokyo Gaikokugo Gakko (Tokyo Foreign Language School); he seems to have pursued the study of physics on his own by reading in German sources. In 1875 he began to teach at the Tokyo Medi cal School, one of the two institutions which joined to form the University of Tokyo in 1877. In 1879 he wrote a popular physics text for medical students which was used by the University of Tokyo Medical Department. At the same time he was employed by the University Gateway School as a physics teacher. Iimori used his own funds to go to Germany in 1884, and two years later he received a doctorate in physics from the University of Freiburg. On his return to Japan he became a teacher of physics at a pres tigious Tokyo high school, the Fourth Higher School, and then moved to Tokyo Joshi Koto Shihan Gakko (Tokyo Women's Higher Teachers' Col lege, a successor to the Women's Teachers' College).121 To summarize, two of the four German-language physicists became Pro fessors of Physics at the University of Tokyo: Kitao in the Department of Agriculture and Muraoka in the Department of Medicine. Iimori taught in the Department of Medicine but reached professorial rank only at another institution. Shiga left physics to become Professor of Agriculture and thus managed to stay at the University of Tokyo. Despite the language handicap the German-language physicists were important to the teaching of physics in Japan, but they did not equal the English-language physicists Yamagawa and Tanakadate who made contributions of great significance to physics as a scholarly discipline. The French-Language Physicists The number of graduates of the French Language Physics Department and their activities made them into a true group. Table F (Appendix) gives data on the thirteen of the twenty-one graduates of the program for whom career information exists. If one is to judge by the prestige of their positions, the four French-lan guage physicists who achieved greatest recognition were Terao Hisashi, Namba Tadashi, Miwa Koichiro, and Nakamura Tokio. The first three be came professors at one of the two Imperial Universities and the fourth be came Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory in Tokyo. Their contributions, however, were not to physics but to other sciences and were of a practical nature. 121Ibid., p. 244.</page><page sequence="57">58 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Terao was the outstanding man of the group. One of the first graduates of the French Language Physics Department in 1878, he went to France the next year, studying for four years at the University of Paris under Tisserand and receiving the licenci? es science math?matiques. After his re turn to Japan he became lecturer in astronomy and mathematics in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo in 1883 and was promoted to professor the next year. In 1888 he also became the first Director of the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, a facility of the Imperial University.122 Terao was a good mathematician but uneasy about the pleasure he derived from "pure" mathematics. In an address to young mathematicians at a meeting of the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society in 1889, he asserted that the difference between pure and applied mathematics is that it is only through the latter that one can contribute to society.123 He felt that it is not good for a person to study mathematics solely because of its inherent interest, and that to have no interest in applied mathematics is to have an asocial attitude. It was consistent with his interest in the practical aspects of science that he was one of the strongest supporters of the Tokyo School of Physics and was indeed its first president. Two other French Language Physics Department graduates, Namba and Miwa, became professors at the Kyoto Imperial University, but neither of them in physics. Namba graduated from the department in 1879 and then worked there briefly as an assistant professor. In 1880 he went to the University of Paris and two years later received a licenci? es science phy siques. He stayed on in Paris for another two years, then returned to Japan to work first for the Ministry of Education and then to teach at var ious higher middle schools. From 1896 to 1898 he studied electrical engi neering in France and the United States, and upon his return was appointed Professor of Electrical Engineering at Kyoto Imperial University. In 1919, a year before his death, he became head of the Society for the Study of Electricity.124 Miwa, who graduated in 1880, never studied abroad. He was employed by the University of Tokyo upon graduation and was promoted to Assis tant Professor of Mathematics in 1882. He was still teaching mathematics in the College of Science at that rank in 1886 when the Imperial University l22TBGG, pp. 113-115. 123Part of the speech is quoted in K. Ogura, S?gakushi kenky?

Finally, in 1893 he resigned from the Imperial University, and in 1900 he was made Professor of Mathematics in the College of Science and Engineering at Kyoto Imperial University.125 More than any other, the career of Nakamura was oriented toward the practical. Immediately upon graduation in 1879 Nakamura was employed to do meteorological studies for the Land Survey Division of the Geo graphical Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1886 he went to Europe at his own expense and spent three years there studying meteo rology. After his return to Japan he was employed in 1890 as a technician at the Central Meteorological Observatory, and five years later he was made Director of that facility, a position he retained for twenty-eight years.126 The members of the French-language group shared certain characteristics. Although all were trained in physics, none pursued physics as a career. Most were involved in occupations that were of direct, practical benefit to the development of modern Japan. Three of the thirteen for whom we have data attained life positions in government ministries; at least eight more spent part of their careers working for a ministry. Eleven of the thirteen had teaching experience, but only four became university professors, and none of them professors of physics. They taught in secondary schools, teachers' colleges, and military academies. A few of the French language group made significant contributions to the development of physical sci ence disciplines other than physics, but in general the men in this group committed themselves not to the advancement of knowledge but to the task of building a new Japan by applying the knowledge they had acquired from the Western sciences. The principal expression of their collective commitment was their establishment of the Tokyo School of Physics. 5. THREE MAJOR FIGURES IN EARLY JAPANESE PHYSICS Yamagawa Kenjiro Yamagawa was born on 17 July 1854 in the castle-town of Aizuwaka matsu, about one hundred and thirty miles north of Tokyo (then called Edo).127 He was the third son of Yamagawa Shigekata and his wife MSlbid,, pp. 101-104. Ibid., pp. 153-157. 127For a study of Yamagawa's life the following primary and secondary sources are available: Ko danshaku Yamagawa sensei kinenkai (comp.), Danshaku Yamagawa</page><page sequence="59">60 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Karaginu.128 The family's standing was quite high, since Kenjiro's grand father Shigefusa was one of the councillors under the head of the Aizu fief. Because of the early death of his father when Kenjiro was six his mother and grandfather came to play an important role during his formative years. In his reminiscences Kenjiro describes his mother as a woman who was neither sophisticated nor progressive in her ideas of education, but who seriously and enthusiastically looked after her children's training and their moral education. His grandfather was progressive in his views; he believed in smallpox vaccination at a time when Chinese medicine was still domi nant in Japan, and he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the military offi cials of his fief to adopt Western guns, which he favored over match locks.129 Education in the Aizu fief varied even within the samurai class. Since Yamagawa's family status was high, he received the best education the fief could offer. When he was eight, he entered the only school in the Aizu fief, the Nisshinkan, and studied there until he was fourteen. The Nisshinkan consisted of several divisions, providing education to all levels of students; its traditional curriculum was dominated by ancient Confucian texts and the military arts. The only subject resembling Western scientific studies was arithmetic, taught in the form of abacus practice. Yamagawa did not study that subject and did not learn arithmetic until he was fifteen. The purpose of education in the Aizu fief as in all fiefs was to make the samurai ruling class into an effective force for the preservation of feudal society. Without a sense of the moral code of feudal society and the devotion to uphold it even a man who was highly skilled in the various arts and letters would not have been regarded as educated.130 In 1868, the year that Yamagawa finished his basic education, the Nis shinkan was shut down because of the turmoil of the Meiji Restoration. The Aizu fief was loyal to the shogunate and fought against the Imperial army in an effort to prevent the restoration of imperial powers the shogun had usurped. Yamagawa was assigned to a corps of fourteen- to sixteen senseiden (Tokyo, 1939); Ko danshaku Yamagawa sensei kinenkai (comp.), Danshaku Yamagawa sensei iko (Tokyo, 1937); M.

As the ruling class of a defeated enemy of the throne, the Aizu samurai were forbidden to leave their territory, were stripped of the power to conduct normal fief activities, and were condemned to years of uncertainty and waiting. During this time they secretly dispatched an observer to travel around the country, and Yamagawa was assigned to accompany him. For several adventurous months Yamagawa travelled in disguise and under the threat of death if apprehended. During the waiting years he also read many Japanese and Chinese classics and studied a little French.132 Around 1870 Yamagawa went to Tokyo; his youth and status in the fief suggest that he did not make the decision on his own, but that one of his teachers or one of the officials in the Tokyo office of the Aizu fief rec ommended that he go. By 1870 the defeated fief had been given permission to reconstitute itself and had resumed administrative functions. During the postwar period the finances of the fief were in poor condition, leaving Yamagawa without any means of support for his studies and thus exposed to considerable deprivation during his first year in Tokyo. Lack of financial support also prevented him from entering one of the more important educational institutions such as the Southern Division or Keio Gijuku, the private school founded by Fukuzawa Yukichi. Although Yamagawa does not say so in his autobiographical memoir, he seems to have been interested in Western studies from the start.133 He studied introductory English in a class held at a temple called Tokusuiin for three months and then managed to gain entrance to a private establish ment called Numata Juku, where, for the first time, he studied elementary algebra and geometry.134 After only three or four months of study at the Numata Juku, Yamagawa suddenly received an order from the new Meiji government to go to Russia to study technology.135 The government had set for itself the task of 131Yamagawa owed his life to the release of the fourteen-year-olds from the corps. When the shogunate forces were defeated by the Imperial army, the surviving mem bers of the White Tigers committed harakiri or ritual suicide at the fall of Aizu castle. Had Yamagawa been one year older and not released from the corps, he would have done the same. 132IkD, pp. 192-193. l33Ibid? pp. 43 and 63. 134Ibid., do. 51-52. 135See Dajokan nisshi of 3 December 1870.

For that purpose the government established in 1869 an ad hoc division. The division decided to send thir teen young students abroad to obtain the knowledge necessary for devel oping a northern frontier. The selection of students was largely political; ten of the thirteen were chosen from the two fiefs whose forces had con tributed in a major way to the defeat of the shogunate and which were now rewarded with major responsibilities in the new Meiji government. The remaining three students were chosen from three different fiefs with cold climates; they were considered best for developing a cold island like Hokkaido. Aizu was one of the fiefs with a cold climate and for reasons that are not clear the division chose Yamagawa as the student from that fief.136 The original plan to send the students to Russia was soon dropped137 because Japanese returning from abroad reported that Russia was too un developed to serve as training grounds.138 Yamagawa and the other stu dents now were to go to the United States where study was judged to be more fruitful. The use of such simplistic criteria indicates inadequate plan ning. Yamagawa had studied very little English, had almost no background in Western learning, and was certainly ill-prepared for study abroad. Nevertheless, he left for the United States on 1 January 1871; he was seventeen years old. Before his trip to the United States Yamagawa had never dreamed of becoming a physicist.139 The incident that changed the course of his life took place while he was still in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on his way to America. Yamagawa records it in his recollections: At that time I was still not quite able to throw off that rather old fashioned anti-foreign attitude and still could not bring myself to feel respect for the likes of foreigners. But right off the thing that surprised me the most and made me feel that I must without fail learn from them was something that happened while I was still in the middle of the Pa cific Ocean. "Late tonight or at dawn tomorrow," they said, "we will 136Jjfe?&gt;, pp. 44-45. 137Printed in Daj?~kan nisshi of 3 July 1871.

See Den, p. 65. MlbUL, p. 25.</page><page sequence="63">64 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS meet the shipping company's Pacific Mail Ship. Those who wish to send letters back to Japan, please make correspondence ready." To say that the paths of two ships that had come to the middle of the ocean would precisely meet on such a vast sea was really a little too pretentious a boast, I said to myself dubiously. Nonetheless I wrote a letter. But it was about 3 or 4 in the morning, I think, when I saw at a distance of about 700 feet from us that a ship had come to stop and our ship was sending a boat out to receive letters and to deliver our items to the other ship. When I saw this I was profoundly convinced of how great their learning was, that Japan could be in no way a match for them, and that foreign learning was an unfathomable thing.140 In telling of his startling experience, Yamagawa did not specifically indi cate what he wanted to study, but he showed that he was strongly at tracted to scientific matters. The event transformed him from a passive traveler into an active seeker after knowledge, and made him an enthusias tic participant in the plans for his study abroad. After arriving in America Yamagawa entered a junior high school in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with the help of a Japanese who was already in the United States. He soon left there, however, and moved to Norwich, Connecticut, because he was anxious to avoid being distracted from his studies by the social activities of the many Japanese then living in the New Brunswick area. At times there were as many as thirty to forty Japanese studying there, and Yamagawa found it difficult to concentrate on his studies in such a lively community. Under the guidance and probably at the suggestion of the principal of his new junior high school in Norwich, Yamagawa prepared for the entrance examinations for the Sheffield Scien tific School at Yale University. In May 1872 he was granted admission pro vided he would study trigonometry during the summer.141 The Japanese government was not involved in Yamagawa's plans and movements; it had sent him off to learn, but left it to him to select the institutions and sub ject. By this time Yamagawa had formed a definite idea as to what he wanted to do in the future. The process by which he decided on a career and the way in which his decision reflected his earlier training are significant. He tells us in his recollections: I had never thought about my future as much as I did in those days. It was just at the time when Herbert Spencer's new philosophical works 140iM pp. 48-49. ?4lIbid., pp. 52-53, and Den, pp. 68-69.</page><page sequence="64">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 65 were being published, and they had a tremendous influence on young people's thinking. A man by the name of Dr. Youmans [Edward Living ston Youmans] in New York started to publish a magazine called The Popular Science Monthly [the first issue appeared in May 1872] which strongly advocated Spencer's principle [in a series of articles by Spencer starting with the first issue]. The more I thought about Youmans' idea, knowing that we must work to perfect Japan, the more I felt that in order to do so we must work to improve our government. But to improve government, one must improve society. To improve society, it is neces sary to study sociology. To study sociology it is necessary to learn biology as well as other natural sciences. Believing that above all to en rich the nation and strengthen the military one must bring to perfection the sciences of physics and chemistry, I made up my mind to study physics.142 Youmans' discussions of the applications of scientific methods in the early issues of his journal did not link the efforts of the individual scientist to a national goal. He limited himself to the argument that scientific in vestigation can and should be applied to all subjects:143 "[i] ntellect, feel ing, human action, language, education, history, morals, religion, law, commerce, and all social relations and activities."144 He said nothing spe cifically about biology, physics, or chemistry.145 Spencer, too, had spoken only of the need of scientific methods in sociology. Yamagawa connected Youmans' and Spencer's ideas to Confucian logic and ethics; the argument by which he decided upon a career links the idea of the usefulness of West ern science to the main tenets of his early education. One of the first Confucian texts Yamagawa would have learned as a child, The Great Learning, contains a passage that played a key role in Japanese education and was frequently quoted. The passage reads: Things being investigated, knowledge became complete. Their knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere. Their thoughts being sin cere, their hearts were rectified. Their hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated. Their persons being cultivated, their families were regu lated. Their families being regulated, their states were rightly governed. ^Ik?, p. 53. I43see The Popular Science Monthly, 1 (1872), 113-115. l**Ibid., p. 113. 145But in a summary of Spencer's thought in the "Editor's Table" of the December issue, Youmans mentioned biology as indispensable to the study of sociology. See ibid., 2 (1872), 240.</page><page sequence="65">66 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS Their states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tran quil and happy.146 The argument of the Confucian text is almost the same as Yamagawa's, although the order in which the argument is carried out is reversed: in The Great Learning it proceeds from the individual to the general; Yamagawa argues from the general to the specific. Through perfecting learning, Yama gawa wanted to perfect society in Japan, bringing his decision to study physics into perfect harmony with Confucian ethics and reasoning. When Yamagawa entered the Sheffield Scientific School in 1872, the school offered chemistry, civil engineering, agriculture, natural history, medicine, and mining and metallurgy as majors, but not physics. Yamagawa chose civil engineering "in the hope that it would provide a foundation for physics."147 The science course at Sheffield was designed to take three years. During the first year all science majors took introductory courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, and related subjects; in the second and third years they concentrated on one of the majors. The civil engineering program included courses in differential and integral calculus, mechanics, astronomy, and hydraulics, but it was after all a major for civil engineers and not at all adequate training for a physicist.148 In his Recollections, Yamagawa reports that he audited a graduate course in mathematics and read various physics books on his own;149 his account does not allow us to to judge the full extent of his study of physics. The only existing descrip tion of Yamagawa as a student at Sheffield occurs in a letter of introduc tion, dated 4 May 1875, from W. A. Norton, a professor of civil engineering who taught astronomy and applied mechanics at Sheffield, to S. Newcomb, an astronomer at the astronomical observatory in Washington, D.C. Norton explained that Yamagawa was "remarkably earnest and diligent in the prosecution of his studies, and maintained a distinguished rank in scholar ship."150 Despite further financial difficulties after the Japanese govern ment ceased to send money for his support, Yamagawa completed all of his courses with financial help from an American and returned to Japan in May 1875.151 146Quoted in Dore's Education in Tokugawa Japan, p. 41. 1477fe?&gt;, pp. 68-69. 148The information about the courses at the Sheffield Scientific School is from Watanabe's "Yamagawa," pp. 114-115. ^Iko, pp. 68-69. 150Quoted in "Yamagawa," p. 119. 151 Yamagawa's problems were the result of a policy by which in the 1860's and early 1870's various organizations took the initiative to send students abroad without standard examination requirements or procedures. Thus, the first students to be sent</page><page sequence="66">KENK1CHIRO KOIZUMI 67 In January 1876 Yamagawa was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at the Tokyo Kaisei School, one of the predecessors of the University of Tokyo. He must have been an attractive applicant since scientific training was still a rarity among Japanese at that time.152 He was required to assist Veeder, Professor of Physics, in instructing students in physics experiments. In 1879 Yamagawa was promoted to Professor of Physics, the first Japa nese to reach that rank. When foreign professors such as Mendenhall, Ewing, and Knott were invited to Japan to teach physics at the University of Tokyo, Yamagawa did not become assistant to the Western physicists again but continued in his rank. He was also influential in the Japanese scientific world through his leadership in the scientific dictionary project. After his student Tanakadate began teaching physics at the University of Tokyo in the 1880's, Yamagawa was able to limit his own teaching to such subjects as optics, thermodynamics, and acoustics. In 1888 the University granted its first doctorates and awarded Yamagawa a Doctor of Science degree.153 He did not retire from his professorship until 1901, the year of his twenty-fifth anniversary of teaching physics at the University of Tokyo; and the same year he became president of that institution.154 Since Yamagawa was the first Japanese professor of physics, I shall ex amine his scientific activities during his years at the University of Tokyo. Yamagawa wrote only two or three papers that might be considered scien tific; these dealt with the relation between the occurrence of fires and weather, with capillary action, and with the measurement of the thermal conductivity of marble.155 His other publications included popular essays abroad were not all the best. A debate arose in Japan over whether or not such stu dents should be called home immediately. Since it was difficult to screen the stu dents already abroad, it was decided that all but the truly exceptional students were to be recalled to Japan. Yamagawa, too, received the order to return, but he wanted to complete his studies and decided to stay at his own expense.

See Shimbun sh?sei Meiji hennenshi, 2, 338. 153In 1888 the Japanese government issued an ordinance stating that the Imperial University was to set up a system whereby doctoral degrees could be granted in rec ognition of outstanding work. The university complied by awarding fifteen doctor ates, five each in science, medicine, and engineering. l54Denj pp. 80-102. 155K.

That Yamagawa published on science at all is due to the presence of the foreign physics professors such as Ewing, Mendenhall, and Knott in Tokyo in the 1880's, and to the stimulating scientific atmosphere they created through their experimental work. His paper on "Fires in Tokio" was in fact suggested by Mendenhall. Just at that time, too, the first Japa nese academic journals began to appear; Memoirs of the Science Depart ment was started in 1879 and the Journal of the College of Science in 1887. (See Table C [Appendix].) Yamagawa may have felt obliged to support the journals by publishing in them.157 Yamagawa's teaching was praised and criticized. Kuwaki Ayao, a physi cist who studied under Yamagawa in the 1890's, recalls that Yamagawa's lectures were well prepared and easy to take notes from. On the other hand Takagi Teiji, a mathematician who was studying during the same years, re calls that while Yamagawa lectured, he constantly copied his lecture notes onto the blackboard in English and would become so engrossed in copying he even accidentally omitted sections of his notes at times.158 He was probably not a very stimulating professor. He was important all the same because he was one of the very few Japanese teaching physics at that time and the only full professor among them, and because he recognized the value of both academic and applied physics and passed this understanding on to his students. One crucial aspect of Yamagawa's thinking was that, in contrast to earlier Confucian-trained Japanese scholars, he firmly believed that learning should have a theoretical basis. Engineering, which in his view lacked theory, should be based upon mathematics, physics, and chemistry. His view of learning was supported, he felt, by the achievements of Fresnel ductivity of Marble," The Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University, Japan, 2 (1889), 263-281. 156See "Yamagawa," pp. 123-126. 157When the discovery of X rays reached Japan in early 1897, Yamagawa was one of the earliest to successfully repeat X ray experiments in that country. Although he gave speeches on X rays, he never published accounts of his experiments in academic journals. Neither did he publish accounts of his investigations on ESP and psycho photography (with the exception of one very brief essay). 158See A. Kuwaki, Kagakushi ho (Tokyo, 1944), p. 507, and T. Takagi, "Meiji no senseigata," in Sugaku to jinsei, Y. Yoshida et al., eds.

He also defended the importance of pure research in public. In a series of public lectures in 1907 Yamagawa mentioned a newspaper article written by a reporter after visiting the College of Science at Tokyo Imperial University. Upon ob serving research on the parasites of earthworms, the reporter wrote that "scholars are those who study such trivial things as this." Yamagawa re sponded: In the first place science took as its aim the search for truth about physi cal matter. It has nothing to do with the importance or triviality of the subject matter being researched. No one can know whether that which is being studied is ultimately important or trivial, insignificant or weighty, until we have looked at the results after the research has been concluded. If we make clear this truth, it will without fail yield us a useful and bene ficial result. About a hundred years ago Galvani discovered that if one inserts a copper wire into a frog's leg, inserts a steel wire into his back, and then touches the steel and copper wire together, the frog's leg will contract, and he investigated this phenomenon. If we had shown this to that newspaper reporter he would certainly have laughed at such non sense. How could it have been known then that the lights that illuminate this very room, or the streetcar by which you came here today, or even the wireless telegraph that succeeded so brilliantly in the Russo-Japanese War would all be the result of that research.160 Yamagawa was most successful as an administrator. He was made dean of the College of Science at the Imperial University in 1893 and president of the University in 1901; in 1904 he became a life member of the House of Peers. He organized and was the first president of the Meiji Semmon Gakko or Meiji Technical School, which opened in 1909. He became president of Kyushu Imperial University161 when it was founded in 1911, ?^Den, pp. 92-93. 160Printed inGakujutsu ts?zoku kdensh? (Tokyo, 1907), pp. 1-3. 161 Kyushu Imperial University was the fourth Imperial University. It had two Colleges: Medical and Engineering. Its College of Science was not set up until 1930. A third Imperial University had been established in Tohoku in 1907, its College of Science opening in 1911.</page><page sequence="69">70 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS but resigned two years later to resume the presidency of Tokyo Imperial University in 1913, a position he retained until 1920. Concurrently with the latter post, from 1914 to 1915 he held the post of president of Kyoto Imperial University. It is unique in Japanese educational history that one man was not only president of three Imperial Universities, but at one point held two presidencies concurrently. To have been president of Tokyo Im perial University twice would in itself have been enough to assure him lasting fame. In 1915 he was granted the title of baron in recognition of his achievements. I want to comment on the Meiji Technical School, which was a private engineering school founded in 1909 by Yasukawa Keiichiro, a business man who had made a fortune during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 1905. Yamagawa, having resigned from his first presidency of Tokyo Im perial University in 1905, was in semiretirement when Yasukawa approached him with the idea of the school in 1906. Yamagawa accepted the task of setting up the institution because he agreed with Yasukawa that science would make Japan capable of coping with the West and be cause he deplored the lack of training programs in scientific engineering in Japan's private universities. Yasukawa gave him complete freedom in the administrative and financial concerns of the school. Yamagawa selected faculty members from graduates of the College of Engineering of Tokyo Imperial University to teach three programs: mining, metallurgy, and machinery. Although in most respects the institution resembled other en gineering schools, it also incorporated the routines and disciplines of a military academy; in addition to the academic curriculum the program re quired target practice, drilling, field operations, and other forms of mili tary training.162 Yamagawa's educational innovation aimed at producing Meiji Technical School graduates who combined the skills of engineer and soldier and reflected the high value he attributed to loyalty and patrio tism.163 Yamagawa's second term as president of Tokyo Imperial University from 1913 to 1920 belonged to an important period in Japanese science. In the 1910's two major scientific institutions had been established: Rikagaku Kenky?sho, or the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, in 1917, 162The school had a four-year course. Twenty students studied mining, fifteen metallurgy, and twenty machinery. See Den, p. 166. Although the school is reminis cent of the Ecole polytechnique in France, that institution was not Yamagawa's model. The school was an embodiment of the educational values he personally prized. 163Den, pp. 161-172.</page><page sequence="70">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 71 and Kok? Kenky?sho, or the Aeronautical Research Institute, in 1918. The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research was set up with funds from both government and industrial circles and was modeled after foreign na tional research institutes such as the Imperial Physico-Technical Institute (Reichsanstalt) and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Germany, the National Physical Laboratory in Great Britain, and the National Bureau of Stan dards in the United States. Yamagawa did little lobbying for the establish ment of the Institute, but he was on its ad hoc planning committee, and he was appointed as its first consultant.164 He was more actively involved in the establishment of the Aeronautical Research Institute, probably be cause of the importance of airplanes to military affairs. At least two years prior to its establishment, he had lobbied the government for such a research center. After the budget of the new Institute was finally ap proved by the Diet, he pressed for an affiliation between the Institute and Tokyo Imperial University and devised a system whereby professors appointed to the University could devote themselves to the Institute's re search. In 1919, when the Japanese army and navy on the one hand and the Ministry of Education on the other independently announced pre liminary plans to establish a national aeronautical institute, Yamagawa firmly opposed these plans and succeeded in expanding the Aeronautical Research Institute instead.165 Yamagawa studied physics for the sake of Japan, believing that the sci ences serve the state; he also praised pure science such as Fresnel's and Leverriers' "victories of learning." Contradictory though these two aspects of his view of physics may be, he did not see them that way; they were reconciled by his primary concern that Japan be a first-rate country. He expressed no view of nature nor of matter, an aspect of Western science that was never his concern. In later life he became increasingly concerned with moral education in addition to scientific education, using the Meiji Technical School to cultivate both. His ideas on moral education were a 164K.

After the death in 1917 of Kikuchi Dairoku, the first director of the Institute, Yamagawa was asked to take over the directorship; he declined. He was asked again in 1921, when the second director Furuichi Koi resigned for health reasons; again he declined. Although he did not want to become director himself, he apparently influenced the ultimate choice of directors. See Den, pp. 283-285. I65j)en, pp. 331-332. When the Aeronautical Research Institute was enlarged in 1919, Yamagawa was asked to become director. He agreed to serve as acting director, but he declined, as he did in the case of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Re search, to become its permanent director.

The school dormitory bore a patriotic ancient Chinese name taken from an early classic, yet the young students living there were taught to become "gentlemen," even to the ex tent of applying the English term to themselves and learning the proper behavior of a gentleman from anecdotes about Western men.166 With ref erence to General Nogi, one of the last of the great traditional samurai and loyal supporters of the Emperor, Yamagawa was called "General Nogi in a frock coat,"167 an expression that well describes the cultural dualism he represented. To transform Japan into a first-rate country was the goal that determined Yamagawa's whole life; the means toward that end were pa triotism, morality, and the pursuit of physics or science in general. He conceived of the Meiji Technical School as the instrument with which to produce men with these three concerns. Yamagawa considered such men indispensable for the survival of Japan. Tanakadate Aikitsu The first son of Tanakadate Inazo and his wife Kisei, Tanakadate Aikitsu was born in 1856 in the Nambu fief (present-day Iwate Prefecture) on the northeast coast of Japan's main island of Honshu.168 His father was a teacher of the Jitsuyo school of military tactics, a profession the men in his family had already pursued for four generations; his mother came from a family of Shinto priests. As was customary for the first son of a samurai, Tanakadate began his studies at the age of four by learning Japanese writing and the art of callig raphy. At eight he began to study swordsmanship under the tutelage of a local samurai while continuing to study calligraphy. In the following year he entered a small private school, the Reisaijo, where he started Chinese studies while continuing his study of swordsmanship. In 1867 at the out break of the hostilities that were to lead to the Meiji Restoration, the Reisaijo was closed. Tanakadate briefly studied Chinese with Terii Kosaku, l66Iko, pp. 324-326 and pp. 285-289. 167Den, p. 515. Nogi Maresuke became general during the Russo-Japanese War and was particularly famous for winning the battle at Lii-shun. Out of loyalty to the emperor he and his wife committed ritual suicide at the death of Emperor Meiji in 1912. 168por a study of Tanakadate's life see the reliable biography Tanakadate Aikitsu sensei (Tokyo, 1946) by his former student Nakamura Seiji.

The Meiji Restora tion brought the abolition of the fiefs and put the central government in charge of education. The old fief schools experienced major changes in 1871 when it was decided to adopt Western studies as the main curricu lum; outraged at the change, the Chinese studies faculty resigned. Tanaka</page><page sequence="73">74 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS date was unhappy with the decision, too, and withdrew from school, con tinuing his Chinese and Japanese studies privately.169 At this time external circumstances made it advisable for the Tanakadate family to move to Tokyo. With the abolition of the fiefs, everyone throughout Japan began for the first time in Japanese history to look to Tokyo as the center of educational and political opportunity. Before, in dividual success had largely depended on a man's role in his fief; now his career depended on powerful persons in Tokyo. The Meiji Restoration had also officially abolished the samurai's role in society. This was difficult for all samurai, but hardest on samurai from fiefs that were suffering financial difficulties. During the fighting preceding the Restoration, the Nambu fief had supported the shogun and had engaged in some fighting with a neigh boring fief that supported the Imperial forces. As a consequence Nambu was required to pay reparations to the Meiji government after the Restora tion and was financially drained. Tanakadate's father, no longer able to function as a samurai or to teach military tactics in a fief suffering a de pression, had to seek a new livelihood and decided to become a merchant. To pursue this new career and to assure the best possible education for his children, he moved his family to Tokyo in 1872.170 By this time Tanakadate realized that to survive in the new Japan he would have to involve himself in some way with the Western studies he had previously spurned. In September 1872 he entered Keio Gijuku, a private college, and began studying the Western alphabet to learn English. There existed then two accepted methods of learning a foreign language: seisoku, or the exact method, and hensoku, or the altered method. The former re quired the student to master all aspects of the language. The latter aimed only at developing reading skills and ignored proper pronunciation. In 1873, Fukuzawa Yukichi, the founder of Keio Gijuku, formulated a major educational idea that was to influence Tanakadate's thinking. He said that the terms seisoku and hensoku should be given a broader meaning; they should no longer refer to language instruction only but to all study. Seisoku was the method whereby learning is pursued according to certain prescribed steps, the student moving from the basics to higher levels. Hensoku was the method whereby the student omits the basics and plunges directly into the study that is relevant to his immediate needs. Both types of education were found in Japan at that time, and Tanakadate was deeply impressed by Fukuzawa's insight into their distinction. Con 169Tanakadate, pp. 2-18. l Ibid., p. 20.</page><page sequence="74">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 75 vinced that, education in any field has proper steps that must be taken in the proper sequence and that in true learning one thing must be built upon another, Tanakadate decided that seisoku111 would be his educational method. The high costs of living in Tokyo and attending Kei? Gijuku, a private institution, forced Tanakadate to find a less expensive school. When he learned from a friend about Kobu Daigakko, or School of Engineering, a government institution that was considerably cheaper, he prepared for entrance examinations there. For this purpose he studied geometry and algebra on his own and was tutored in English by the wife of Montague Fenton, a teacher of Western music employed by the navy. Tanakadate did not go to the School of Engineering to inquire into the details of admission until some time later that year. His reaction shows us that his views were still determined by his past and early education. I went to the School of Engineering and got a copy of their catalogue. Looking at it I found that there was not a word on how to govern the nation, which was what I had previously been learning through Chinese studies. There was nothing mentioned but such things as how to build a lighthouse or how to construct a bridge, or, say, how to put up electrical wires. "It's meaningless to learn nothing but this sort of thing," I said to myself, and lost all interest in matriculating. After considerable thought my choice shifted to the University, Southern Division.172 Although Tanakadate refers to the University, Southern Division in this quotation taken from his recollections in 1943, the institution had already changed its name to the Tokyo Kaisei School when he decided to enter it in 1874. He entered the school in 1876 after two years in the English Division of the Gaikokugo Gakko, or School of Foreign Languages, where he had made up a language deficiency that had delayed his admission. The course of studies at the Tokyo Kaisei School extended over six years; it consisted of two years of preliminary general education, followed by four years of specialized study in a major. Tanakadate was critical of the new approach to learning: The curriculum of the first two years was not divided up according to majors, and for that reason the true flavor of our school life was found simply in the pleasure of pure learning itself. However, there were among 171Ibid., pp. 23-24.

In fact, I was one of them. People like us felt that physics and astronomy and the like were no more than trivial skills, and the atmosphere there was permeated by the sentiment that in order to govern the country, such skills are of no use whatsoever.173 Tanakadate's exposure to Western science during his first two years at the Tokyo Kaisei School made him see that learning could also lead to something other than methods of governing men. He was required to take a physics course taught by Yamagawa who, only two years older than Tanakadate, had just returned from the United States. The text Yamagawa used was Balfour Stewart's Physics, which he followed very closely, re quiring the students to all but memorize it.174 At the same time he illustrated the physical principles it contained with examples from ex perience. He related that during the military encounters at the Aizu fief before the Meiji Restoration, the warriors ran toward the enemy cannon positions when fired upon to escape the heaviest pieces of shrapnel. Yamagawa explained that a military man learns from experience, but his behavior can also be justified in terms of the principles of physics. Tanaka date recalled Yamagawa's accounts of Franklin and Fresnel, and he prob ably heard him speak of Fresnel's "victory of learning." Through such interpretations that were not contained in Western scientific texts, Tanakadate began to understand for the first time the Western concept of learning. He understood that "learning" could encompass something be sides a person's moral training in preparation for governing the country.175 Other events influenced the revision of Tanakadate's concept of learning. Most of the oyatoigaikokujin teaching in Japan were practicing Christians, many of whom contended that if Japan were to become an "advanced" nation, it would have to be converted to Christianity. There were skeptics among the foreigners as well, however, particularly those who believed and taught Darwin's theory of evolution. The resulting tensions among the foreign faculty sometimes created open conflict as when Edward Morse's lectures on Darwinism drew theological objections from colleagues. Such conflicts also caused considerable discomfort on the part of the Japanese, most of whom considered Christianity to be the intolerant religion of bar barians who had little or no spiritual sensitivity. No doubt in response to ?l3Ibid., p. 31. 174A.

Veeder stated that since the university is the capital of learning and research, religion and politics should be banished from its halls.176 His view so impressed Tanakadate that he remembered it clearly the rest of his life. The idea that learning could, or even should, be detached from social considerations must have been startling to the young ex-samurai who had been taught that politics was the main concern of education. In the same year, 1878, Tanakadate finished his preliminary two-year course and had to decide upon his specialization for the remaining four years of study. It was a time of indecision and inner conflict for him. He knew that he had to pursue Western studies in order to be effective in Japan, and yet he found it hard to abandon the maxim that "learning is for governing." He had been unable to discover anything conforming to that maxim in his studies at the Tokyo Kaisei School, by now the Uni versity of Tokyo. "Man's aim is to train himself and govern the country," the local elders had admonished me, "and so if you are unable to find employment use ful to your country you must leave written works for the benefit of later generations. To that end study letters." Up to this point, therefore, I had attempted to study the proper way of governing the nation. But as far as governing a country is concerned, from what I have seen so far, there are no Western books explaining how to train oneself and govern the nation that measure up to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. On the other hand, in the field of science there are things I would like very much to study. And so I feel that I want to master physics, which is the basis of all science, so as to make up on full measure for our country's deficiencies.177 The reasons for Tanakadate's choice of a physics career are obscure; but we can see in his decision a merging of several influences. His decision is, first, a compromise between his interest in physics and the old Confucian idea that learning serves the country: he will study physics because he wants to, but he is reassured that his training will contribute to the govern ment of the country. Second, his decision to do physics and not to educate himself for direct political action in government reflects Veeder's insis ll6Ibid., p. 37. 177JbiU, p. 39.</page><page sequence="77">78 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS tence on the "independence of learning." Finally, his words show that Fukuzawa's seisoku?the view that in true learning one thing must be built upon another?still informed his thoughts: "I want to master physics, which is the basis of all science. . . ,"178 Tanakadate's letter in which he informed his father of his choice is lost, but we have his father's reply. The elder Tanakadate told his son that all he wished for him was that by his choice of career he could make some contribution to mankind throughout the world. That reply must have been encouraging, recognizing possibilities for service even beyond the needs of Japan.179 For the next four years, from 1878 to 1882, Tanakadate studied with Yamagawa, Ewing, and Mendenhall. The two foreigners allowed him to participate in their research during this period: Mendenhall in his work on geophysics, Ewing in his on electricity and magnetism. After he graduated in 1882 from what was by then called the Department of Physics, he was made a lecturer in that department and for the next several years served as Yamagawa's assistant. In 1886, the same year that the University of Tokyo became the Imperial University, he was made assistant professor. When two years later the University sent him abroad to study, he went to the University of Glasgow with an introduction from Ewing to study with William Thomson. To the end of his life he spoke of the deep impression Thomson had made on him.180 At Glasgow he worked on experiments re lated to the work in electricity and magnetism that he had done under Ewing in Japan, and he published papers in English on such problems as the magnetization of soft iron bars and the thermal effects of magnetiza tion reversals.181 After two years at Glasgow, he spent a year in Berlin attending lectures by Helmholtz and I. L. Fuchs and a colloquium given by Planck, Kundt, and others.182 On his return to Japan in July 1891 he 178Italics are mine. 179 Tanakadate, pp. 39-40. 180Thomson treated him well in his laboratory and sometimes invited him to his house. When Tanakadate left Glasgow for the Continent, Thomson gave him about ten of his personal cards to use freely for introductions, an uncommon kindness in those days according to Tanakadate.

From then until 1916 he remained at the Imperial University as Professor of Physics; when he retired in 1916 at the age of sixty, he was honored with a celebra tion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his promotion to full professor.183 Tanakadate's scientific activity encompassed three subjects which to a certain extent corresponded to three different periods of his career. Tanakadate was introduced to the first subject, electricity and magnetism, by Ewing; he worked in it from the time he was a student until he returned in 1891 from a trip abroad. He had also early become interested in the second subject, geophysics, when he participated in geomagnetic measure ments under Mendenhall. This subject became his major concern after his return from Europe, largely because of the Nobi earthquake of 1891, which caused enormous damage and the loss of more than two thousand lives in the neighborhood of the city of Nagoya. As early as 1887, the year after he had become an assistant professor, he, Knott, and their stu dents measured Japan's geomagnetism; Knott was responsible for the northern half of the country and Tanakadate for the southern part in cluding the Nagoya area and the Nobi Plains.184 Tanakadate was, there fore, the Japanese scientist who was most experienced in geomagnetism at the time of the earthquake, and the University asked him to investigate its aftermath. His resulting new geomagnetic measurements differed from those he had helped make four years earlier, proving that earthquakes change the geomagnetism of an area.185 The discovery further increased his interest in the subject, and in 1893 he organized a four-year expedition sponsored by the University to make new geomagnetic measurements throughout Japan.186 His work in geophysics continued into the first Museum in Tokyo, but could not determine the name of the journal to which the paper was submitted. ^Tanakadate, pp. 87-141. 184A.

Since the earth is a magnet, it was thought that the presence of mechanical stress inside it should change the earth's magnetism.

In 1918, two years after his retirement from the University, he was appointed supervisor of the Aeronautical Research Institute; he also frequently traveled abroad to attend conferences on weights and measures. After World War II, Tanakadate's scientific activity gradually decreased because of his age; he was ninety-four when he died in 1950. Tanakadate's career represents a clear contrast to Yamagawa's despite the similarity of their backgrounds. Unlike Yamagawa, Tanakadate was not an administrator. His greatest influence on his students at the University and in Japan in general was in experimental physics. Like Yamagawa he chose physics to serve his country, but because of his training under Mendenhall and Ewing, which was far better than Yamagawa's, he also came to enjoy doing experimental physics for its own sake. Yamagawa and Tanakadate differed further in their contacts with Western scientists. Whereas Yamagawa never went abroad again after his four years of foreign study as a young man, Tanakadate traveled abroad with exceptional fre quency for a Japanese of that period. In addition to his first three-year trip to Glasgow and Berlin when he was in his thirties, Tanakadate went abroad more than twenty times between 1898 and 1935, sometimes sent by Japan and sometimes invited to attend international conferences.187 Most of his missions were scientific, but he also participated in the Inter national Congress of Linguists because he was interested in romanizing the Japanese language, and he was involved with the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. Tanakadate enjoyed going abroad; he used English as his main foreign language and broken French or German when necessary. Physics was Tanakadate's passport to the West; his discipline provided him with interests that he could share with foreign colleagues.

Although Yama gawa was able to discern the value of physics, he never questioned the Confucian tradition in Japan, and he tried to superpose Western civiliza tion on a more or less intact Japanese civilization. To the end of his life he could not conceive of learning or of schools without Confucianism. Tanakadate, on the other hand, questioned the simplistic dichotomy drawn between the East and West. In a 1915 lecture to a committee of the House of Peers on the status of current research on airplanes Tanakadate challenged what he assumed to be the common view of the West: As I proceed to inquire into your opinions on the subject, I find that the question of the harmony of Eastern and Western civilizations seems to present a problem. As I understand you, gentlemen, you feel that West ern civilization is a materialistic and mechanistic civilization. In other words, that it is a physical culture lacking in spiritual direction. And you feel that Eastern civilization is a metaphysical culture, and is spiritual; that humanity and a sense of duty are the unique characteristics of the East. It is my understanding that you hope somehow or other to har monize these two cultural viewpoints. But I question whether or not it is all right to interpret Eastern and Western civilizations in such an elementary manner.188 Tanakadate opposed the Japanese view that Western scientists and in ventors worked for material goods. He argued that Western civilization cannot be so trivial if Galileo was willing to die for his scientific beliefs. He insisted that Western civilization, which the Japanese condemned as materialistic, had spiritual values. Tanakadate was comfortable in both the Eastern and the Western world, and he functioned in the world of physical research which in principle recognized no national or cultural barriers. Tanakadate has been described as a man who failed to escape from the Confucian context.189 I agree inso far as Tanakadate justified his work in physics by Confucian arguments in the beginning; but he rapidly moved beyond that narrow context. The task of bringing Eastern and Western cultures into harmony ceased to be a real, personal problem for him. He was not a General Nogi in a frock coat, but a Japanese physicist of the new order. 188Quoted inTanakadate, p. 194. 189S.

By contrast, Nagaoka Hantaro represented a new phenomenon in the history of Japanese physics: he chose a career in physics from purely personal motivations and partici pated fully in the competitive world of theoretical and experimental physics. Nagaoka was born on 18 August 1865, the son of Nagaoka Jisaburo, a samurai of the Omura fief (present-day Nagasaki prefecture) in Kyushu, Japan's southernmost island.190 During the disturbances prior to the Meiji Restoration, the Omura fief had fought on the side of the Imperial forces. Because of his enthusiastic support of the Emperor during the fighting, Nagaoka's father was invited in 1871 to join the prestigious Iwakura Mis sion, a group of more than one hundred Japanese headed by leading states men like Iwakura Tomomi, Ito Hirobumi, and Okubo Toshimichi. The purpose of the mission was to initiate talks that might lead to the revision of the unequal treaties then in force between Japan and Western countries and at the same time to study Western institutions in situ.191 Nagaoka's father was deeply concerned about the education of his children, teaching them calligraphy and Chinese studies himself. While he was in England on the Iwakura Mission he bought used textbooks at Eton and Rugby, including a history of England, for his children. Although there is no record of the titles of the books, they were probably the texts used for the liberal arts and natural science courses then taught at the preparatory schools. The elder Nagaoka was so impressed with Western education that upon his return to Japan in 1873 he apologized to his son for having taught him the wrong subjects. "J. am not worthy to be your father for having misled you," he said to his eight-year-old son. "Western ers are studying these books and you too must become a person able to read them. Since I cannot teach you, you must study English." Nagaoka's father even tried to study the books he had brought back himself although he could read no English.192 190Just as I completed the present article, the first full-length biography of Nagaoka appeared. I refer the reader to this lengthy and detailed study for further informa tion: K. Itakura, T. Kimura, and E. Yagi, Nagaoka HantarJ den (Tokyo, 1973). 191H.

Nagaoka Hantaro around 1934 when he was president of Osaka Imperial University. The elder Nagaoka's extraordinary enthusiasm and determination to re place traditional learning with Western studies cannot be due entirely to his experiences in Europe. Since the Omura fief was close to Nagasaki, the the original center for Dutch studies and Japan's only window to the rest of the world during more than two hundred years of isolation, Nagaoka's father was probably psychologically better prepared for the trip than his countrymen from other parts of Japan and went with less hostility and greater receptiveness toward foreigners than was typical in his day. His attitude must have had a profound effect on his son, making it possible for</page><page sequence="83">84 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS the young Nagaoka to escape any inordinate reverence for Chinese studies which, under other circumstances, he might have retained.193 Nagaoka entered the Omura fief school, the Gokyokan, at the age of six. Two years later, in 1873, the fief schools were abolished. The Nagaokas moved to Tokyo in 1874, where for the next four years Nagaoka tried one Tokyo school after another, apparently seeking better English training. In 1877 he entered the University Gateway School to prepare for entrance to the University of Tokyo, but when his father was transferred to Osaka soon afterwards, Nagaoka was forced to change schools again, studying first at the Osaka English School and then at the Osaka Technical School; after the family's return to Tokyo in 1880 he re-entered the University Gateway School. As early as 1877 the twelve-year-old Nagaoka showed an interest in science books. He wanted to read G. P. Quackenbos' A Natural Philosophy, which proved to be too expensive for him, and he bought instead R. G. Parker's First Lesson in Natural Philosophy.194 Nagaoka's interest in these books may not have been exclusively scientific. It is known that some schools used such books as texts for studying English, and Nagaoka may have wanted them for the same reason.195 In 1882, at the age of seventeen, he entered the University of Tokyo. Nagaoka's frankness and self-awareness as well as his indifference to social concerns and his strong personal ambition set him apart from his prede cessors: A year after I had entered the University of Tokyo I became more or less acquainted with the things that were being studied in Europe and America, but I did not plan to follow the work of others or to devote my life to importing learning from abroad and to disseminating it among the Japanese. There was no point in my having had the good fortune to be born a man, if I failed to enter the advanced ranks of researchers and to contribute to the development of some field of learning.196 193 Nagaoka Hantaro's son goes so far as to say that his father would not have become famous if he had not been born in ?mura and had not had the father that he did.

At some time during his first year at the university Nagaoka was defi nitely attracted to science. However, the fear that the Japanese were some how, as a race, inferior to Westerners?a fear many Japanese had at that time?caused him temporarily to interrupt his university studies. The su periority of Western technology may have been one reason for this fear. Another may have derived from Western attitudes toward the Japanese; foreign visitors were often contemptuous of the Japanese or, worse, pa tronizing, treating them as children.197 Specifically, Nagaoka feared that because of his race he might not be able to become a great scientist. He recalled that none of the lectures he heard during his first year at the University referred to an Oriental contribution to physics.198 He said that in his second year at the university "I felt it would be a good plan first to clarify whether or not Orientals have a talent for scientific research, and then to take my time in determining my future course . . . and with firm resolve I asked for a year's leave of absence and tried investigating things related to science in China."199 During his year of research in Chinese science he found that the Chinese had such remarkable accomplishments as the invention of the south-pointing carriage and of gunpowder, the independent discovery of sunspots, and calendar making. He recalled that "in view of the fact that such research had already been achieved, I came to have confidence that Orientals, too, if they devoted themselves to it [science], would, in the end, reach a level not inferior to that of Europe and America."200 He goes on to say that if he had failed to find evidence 197An example that illustrates the racism in Japan at that time is the Normanton incident of 1886. A British cargo boat, the Normanton, was shipwrecked off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture. The British captain and the crew of the ship quickly escaped to safety, abandoning the twenty-three Japanese passengers on board, all of whom drowned. The Japanese responded to the incident with great anger and became even more outraged when at the trial of the British personnel the British Consul judged them innocent of any wrong doing. That judgement would have been im possible had the passengers been British. Protests by the Japanese government re sulted in a second trial at which the captain was finally declared guilty, but sentenced to only three months in jail. The whole episode caused considerable bitterness among the Japanese and aggravated racial antagonisms. See J. Et?, S?seki to sono jidai (Tokyo, 1970), 1, 123-124. 198H.

Both alternatives reflect a basic element in his character: an overwhelming de termination to make Westerners aware of the greatness of Oriental man. His recollections further reveal that neither Yamagawa's work nor Tanaka date's was sufficient to convince him that Japanese could become great pioneers in physics. In 1884 Nagaoka started to study physics at the university. In addition to attending lectures he did extensive outside reading in physics texts, studying, for example, Thomson and Tate's Natural Philosophy. He con sidered independent study an important part of his training, but he was handicapped by the high cost of Western books in Japanese bookstores. Some he obtained from Knott, who ordered his own books directly from England and included orders for Nagaoka and others.201 One year before Nagaoka graduated in 1887, the University of Tokyo became the Imperial University and established a graduate school. The change enabled Nagaoka to go on immediately to advanced studies at the graduate level and made him one of the first products of Japan's new, fully-established educational program in physics. In 1888 Nagaoka was asked to take over Tanakadate's experimental physics class when the latter was sent to Glasgow. Nagaoka, who was still a graduate student, was clearly recognized as a promising physicist. For Nagaoka himself, recognition, particularly by Western physicists, was still related to the racial question. His preoccupation with the question is vividly expressed in an English letter he wrote to Tanakadate in Glasgow. Imperial University 7-6-'88 Dear Tanakadate, I have received yours dated 17th April together with experimental notebooks. These notebooks are indeed convenient. . . . You seem now to be hard at work; how do you like the place? I think you'r[e] not yet much? [totally involved], because you speak so much about the western weaknesses. I find from your letters, that western civilizations were mostly superficial, the works of the tengu's [big-noses] very rough and not at all trustworthy, just [as] you supposed. I think those who praise the height of western civilization, and try to introduce everything done by the whites, considering whatever the whites do are 201H.

I think it is our duty to go ahead of those whites, beat them, and expose their real nature. This indeed as you say depend[s] on mv2/2. This of course can be near parallel with the whites; but I think the first difficulty we meet with in this country is this factor v2. Everything is rather injun [indecisive], and there is a great amount of lagging or reaction or friction in doing anything, either in personal affairs or official business or in almost every undertakings. We must work actively with an open eye, keen sense, and ready under standing, indefaticably and not a moment stopping. We must not allow those classes of people within our doors and interrupt our work, who though appearing as if they were intently at work, soon stops working whenever there comes anything that attract[s] the eye, or the mouth, or the purse. There is no reason why the whites shall be so supreme in everything, and as you say, I hope we shall be able to beat those yattya hottya [pompous] people in the course of 10 or 20 years: I think there is no use of observing the victory of our descendants over the whites with the telescope from jigoku [hell]. Another great requisite in beating those whites is how to make our work known. This is a great difficulty. As a first step we can not write in Japanese and make the westerners understand our writings. We must borrow their language and make the whites understand. Indeed, as you admit, the whites can speak upon any thing, but in our case, we are sometimes unable to speak even though there is sufficient material for talk. I think this is our great defect, and we must, if possible, learn to write and speak clearly and fluently. I don't think there is any choice of language, be it English, French, or German. Please reflect on this point. Now quitting these dreams, I shall speak of something that is going on here . . . ,202 The letter shows that Nagaoka's motivations and goals with respect to physics contrasted sharply with Yamagawa's and Tanakadate's. Instead of Yamagawa's dedication of his life and work to the creation of a safe and 2021 have added translations for the few Japanese words he inserted and a few words or plurals to clarify the meaning, while the rest stands as written.

Tanakadate, too, was not uncritical of the West and sometimes pointed out the weaknesses of Westerners. But Nagaoka's aim was to prove to the world that Japan could equal, if not exceed, Western achievements. Nagaoka was not a samurai afraid that Japan would be militarily over whelmed by Western technology; rather he sought to impress the West with Japanese intellectual capability by proving his worth in physics and through it that of his countrymen. It is hard to call Nagaoka's attitude simply a manifestation of nationalism; his letter suggests that he was driven by personal hatreds and psychological compulsions. He represents a dif ferent type of man than we have seen before. Throughout his life, Yamagawa identified his will with Japan's needs; Tanakadate, too, was motivated by devotion to Japan, but stopped short of a complete submis sion of his life and work. Nagaoka, however, was guided by his own needs, responsive to but not absorbed by Japan's needs; he believed that the Japanese were the coming race, and that he was in the vanguard. In 1890 Nagaoka became an assistant professor. In 1893 he received the Doctor of Science degree and was sent to Europe by the Imperial Uni versity for further study. There he went to the Universities of Berlin, Munich, and Vienna, listened to the lectures of Helmholtz, Planck, Kundt, Fuchs, Schwarz, Boltzmann, and others, and did experimental research.203 During his three-year stay he produced at least seven English or German articles on magnetism, especially magnetostriction, that he published in European journals; in addition he produced at least two English papers on Fraunhofer diffraction that he published in Japan.204 Nagaoka was pro moted to Professor of Physics on his return to Japan in 1896 and from that time on taught applied mathematics and theoretical physics at the Imperial University; at the same time he carried on both theoretical and experimental research.205 203A.

See TTDG, 2, 467-468.</page><page sequence="88">KENKICHIRO KOIZUMI 89 In general his scientific research can be divided into three subjects: magnetostriction, geophysics, and atomic structure and spectroscopy. He became interested in magnetostriction as a graduate student under Knott, who had performed experiments in this subject before his appointment to the University of Tokyo in 1883.206 Nagaoka continued his work in the subject while abroad and after his return to Japan, bringing it to a close only in 1904. He worked especially on the phenomenon of volume change accompanying magnetization and in general on the magnetization of metals.207 In recognition of this work he was invited to give a paper at the First International Congress of Physics held in Paris in 1900.208 He had succeeded in his goal of making the work of Japanese physicists known to their Western colleagues. Nagaoka's research, like Tanakadate's, was influenced by the Nobi earth quake of 1891. He was still an assistant professor at the time and had not yet gone abroad. As a member of one of several groups under the general supervision of Tanakadate, he carried out geomagnetic measurements after the quake and then continued to investigate both geomagnetism and the gravitational constant g until the early 1900's. Eventually he gave up field work, moved to laboratory and theoretical work in geophysics, and pub lished on seismology, tidal waves, volcanic action, and many other geo physical subjects. He retained an active interest in geophysical research throughout his life.209 Nagaoka first became interested in the third area of his scientific activity, atomic structure and spectroscopy, in 1900 at the First International Congress of Physics, where he saw Marie Curie's demonstration of radium and realized how complicated atoms must be. He was also impressed by Poincare''s remark that the study of atomic structure would be facilitated 206K. Itakura et dX.,Nagaoka Hantaro" den, p. 94. 207According to Nagaoka, Joule observed only a change in length in his experi ments on magnetostriction. Nagaoka and Honda also observed a change in volume, which W. Thomson called the "Nagaoka-Honda Effect." See H. Nagaoka, "Kaikodan," Nihon butsurigakkai shi, 5 (1950), 324. 208H.

Two were physicists: Yamaguchi Einosuke, who had graduated from the Physics Department three years before Nagaoka and was in Germany in 1900 doing research, and Mizuno Toshinoj?, who had graduated three years after Nagaoka. The other two, Odagiri Enju and Ohdachi Gentaro, were connected with the Japanese navy. See Travaux au Congr?s International de Physique (Paris, 1901), 4, 129-169. 209T.

In De cember 1903, he went before the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society and proposed his "saturnian atom," a large, positively charged central particle surrounded by many equidistant electrons revolving with a com mon angular velocity. He published a paper in English describing his model in the proceedings of the Tokyo society and again in the Philosophical Magazine the following year.213 J. J. Thomson also proposed an atomic model at this time.214 The response to Nagaoka's atomic model in Japan was rather cool at first. He recalled sardonically that the Japanese worshippers of such world shaking names as Kelvin and J. J. Thomson offered no comment at all; other Japanese physicists felt that the atomic structure he proposed would be unstable under collision in gases.215 Physicists in Europe were attentive, but skeptical. G. A. Schott criticized the instability of the "Saturnian atom."216 Poincare' called Nagaoka's model "a very interesting attempt, but not yet wholly satisfactory" and thought that "this attempt should be renewed."217 Nagaoka's model was received with so little enthusiasm that Rutherford had not read Nagaoka's paper nor heard of his model when he 210H.

It contributed to a growing confi dence in Japan that Japanese could work in the mainstream of world physics and have their work known internationally; it also resulted in the legend that Nagaoka had been the first to propose an atomic model that pointed in the right direction. Kuwaki Ayao adopted that view of Nagaoka when he wrote in 1921; "As a matter of fact, the atomic models conceived at [the] present time are not the same as those of 1903, but in so far as they resemble the solar system in miniature, his original conception still persists. That Professor Nagaoka was the first to propound the nuclear structure of the atom will ever stand to his credit in the history of sci ence."219 Through his involvement with atomic models, Nagaoka became interested in spectroscopy, but from about 1908 all of his work was ex perimental and no longer theoretical. He investigated the spectra of a wide variety of substances, showing a particular interest in the Zeeman effect of mercury. His papers on spectroscopy ultimately constituted at least forty percent of his published work.220 Unlike Yamagawa, Nagaoka loathed administrative responsibilities and managed for most of his life to avoid them. When a sixth Imperial Uni versity was established in Osaka in 1931, Nagaoka for once could not escape administrative duties. In a sharp controversy between the city of Osaka, which had long lobbied for its own Imperial University, and the Ministry of Education over an appropriate person to become the univer sity's first president, Nagaoka's name emerged as the only one acceptable to both sides, and he was, for all practical purposes, forced to accept the 218Rutherford wrote to Nagaoka on 20 March 1911: "You will notice that the structure assumed in my atom is somewhat similar to that suggested by you in a paper some years ago. 1 have not yet looked up your paper; but I remember that you did write on that subject. I gave a preliminary account of my results to the Manchester Lit. and Phil. Soc. recently, and hope soon to be published in the Philosophical Maga zine." Rutherford's letter is printed as Appendix I to E. Yagi, "On Nagaoka's Saturnian Atomic Model," pp. 46-47. The quotation is from page 47. Thus, Ruther ford mentioned Nagaoka in his 1911 paper ("The Scattering of a and 0 Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom," Philosophical Magazine, 21 [1911], 669 688), but only in a footnote. Rutherford heard of Nagaoka's paper from W. H. Bragg on 11 March 1911, but he had already given his report on his atomic model to the Manchester Library and Philosophical Society four days earlier.

But he was furious, and considered the three years during which he held the post to be his years "in prison."221 The nonteaching positions he held were always closely related to physics; he was, for example, Chairman of the Physics Division of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research from 1917 to 1922, and he served as Chairman of the Physics Division of the National Research Council of Japan from 1920 to 1943. Nagaoka's work won him recognition both at home and abroad. He was made an honorary member of the Socie'te' des Physiques et d'Histoires Nature lies in Geneva in 1901. In 1912 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Physical Society of London, which at that time had such distin guished foreign members as Marie Curie and H. A. Lorentz. Cambridge University awarded him an honorary degree in 1925, a distinction Nagaoka's father had surely never dreamed of when buying used Eton and Rugby texts some thirty years before. Nagaoka was elected to the Japanese House of Peers in 1937, and the same year he and his student Honda Kotaro received Japan's first Imperial Order of Culture, awarded for their work in physics. In 1939 he became president of the Imperial Academy, Japan's highest honorary learned society, of which he had been a member since 1905; he served in that capacity until 1948. Throughout his career Nagaoka was interested in philosophical or theo retical questions on the one hand and in the application of physics on the other. He not only read the works of Chinese philosophers for pleasure, but he related philosophy to physics in seeking an answer to the question: What is matter? It was an intellectual question that he could detach from the problems of Japan's technological advancement and from political and moral questions.222 Nagaoka's interest in atomic models was chiefly moti vated by the philosophical or theoretical challenge it presented. His prob ings into the philosophical question of the nature of matter led him to write articles in Japanese for intellectual and philosophical magazines; the subjects he wrote on can be seen from titles such as "The Development of Ideas on the Structure of Minute Particles of Matter" and "Recent Views on Matter."223 From 1904 on, Nagaoka advocated at every opportunity the application of physical principles to problems of technology.

In 1911 in a speech to secondary school physics teachers, he went so far as to say that the main aim of physics is to find ways of apply ing the principles of physics to technology.224 He engaged in a number of strictly utilitarian efforts such as the compilation of a table of elliptic functions and their integrals for the purpose of facilitating calculations of self-inductance and mutual inductance of circular coils.225 From time to time over a period of ten years he even worked on the problem of trans muting mercury to gold.226 It was consistent with Nagaoka's competitive nature that he also became an aggressive advocate for science in general. Unlike either Yamagawa or Tanakadate, he was constantly urging the advancement of Japanese sci ence. "Warning to our Scientific World," was the title of a speech he gave in 1913 in which he attributed the slow development of Japanese science to an insufficient "spirit of scientific research" and to a dearth of people to preach the values of science and to create opportunities for its advance ment.227 Writing on the state of physics research in Japan in a popular Japanese journal, he criticized blind imitation and chided that "when physicists in Europe and America look at the Japanese scientific world it must present as curious a sight as a silk top hat being worn on top of a samurai's top-knot."228 Although by the time he died in 1950 Nagaoka had published more than three hundred papers, far exceeding Tanakadate, who had published fewer than forty, he had made almost no written contributions to quantum or relativity physics, major areas of twentieth-century physical research. For this reason, even though his scientific activities fall entirely in the twenti eth century, we must consider him essentially a ninteenth-century physi cist.

He had con siderable respect for Helmholtz, and devoted to him at least three of the many short biographies he wrote on major Western scientists. He also seems to have admired Boltzmann. The mechanistic worldview held by these men was shared by Nagaoka.230 Nagaoka nonetheless conveyed the image of a modern physicist; Yama gawa and Tanakadate had failed him as models, but he became an inspiring model for young Japanese growing up in the twentieth century. Yukawa Hideki, Japan's first Nobel Prize winner in physics, wrote in 1967: "Look ing back on it, I feel that probably the one decisive factor in causing me as a high school student in the early 1920's to choose unhesitatingly the path of research physics, was the fact that one could find among the Japanese ahead of one [on the path] such a great physicist [as Nagaoka Hantaro] ,"231 Nagaoka's conspicuous activity in both theoretical and ex perimental physics, his articulate advocacy of high standards of achieve ment for Japanese science, and, behind it all, the legend of his role in the discovery of the atomic model made him perhaps Japan's first true physi cist. From his time on, physics was a naturalized discipline in Japan; or perhaps one should say that with him Japanese physicists entered the mainstream of world physics. Japan's first generation of physicists comprised many types of men with differing talents, driven by differing needs and motives. They lived through one of the most turbulent and yet stimulating periods of Japanese history. The groundwork they laid against incredible odds was firm enough to sup port the development of physics in Japan to the point where, some sixty years later, Japan had produced a Nobel Prize winner in physics.

IN CONCLUSION I will conclude my discussion of the first stages of the development of physics in Japan with a look at the state of Japanese physics shortly after the turn of the century. By that time physics in Japan had grown from nothing to a level where it was sufficiently institutionalized to permit Japanese participation in the international physics world. By 1900 Japan had established two universities that were producing physicists, Tokyo Imperial University and Kyoto Imperial University. The former, which was Japan's main center for physics teaching and research, had graduated over one hundred physicists by 1900, and it continued to produce at least four or five physicists a year thereafter.233 Its physics faculty consisted of three professors, three assistant professors, and two lecturers of physics, all Japanese. In 1901 the Physics Department was divided into a theoretical and an experimental section; by 1903 the newly organized department had graduated four theoretical and four experimental physicists.234 Kyoto Imperial University was not established until 1897 and hence did not pro duce any physics graduates until 1902; but its physics faculty in 1900 in cluded at least three professors.235 In the years around 1900 Japanese physicists drew international atten tion of various sorts. Invitations were extended to Tanakadate to attend the 1898 geodesy conference in Stuttgart and to Nagaoka to give a paper at the 1900 Paris Physics Congress. Yamaguchi's paper "Zur Kenntniss des thermomagnetischen Transversaleffect im Wismut"236 found recognition when Paul Drude cited it in his extremely influential paper "Zur Elek 232Yukawa won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1949 for his theoretical prediction of the meson. 233Tokyo teikoku daigaku sotsugyosei shimeiroku, pp. 283-285. 234JbtU, p. 285, and TTDG, 2, 444-445. 235Kyoto teikoku daigaku sotsugyosei shimeiroku (Kyoto, 1967), pp. 460 and 465. 236In Annalen der Physik, 4th ser., 1 (1900), 214-224.</page><page sequence="95">96 JAPAN'S FIRST PHYSICISTS tronentheorie der Me talle."237 Nagaoka's paper on atomic structure stimu lated comment from several Western scientists in 1904 and after.238 In addition to the establishment of physics as a disqipline in Japanese academic institutions and the international recognition of the work of Japanese physicists, there were other signs that the transplant of Western science had taken root in Japan. By 1901 the Tokyo Mathematico Physical Society had a membership of 175.239 Its journal, Tokyo s?gaku butsuri gakkai kiji, contained articles written not only in Japanese, but in romanized Japanese and in English, and in 1901 it also began to publish the Proceedings of the Tokyo Mathematico-Physical Society in which most articles were written in English. Tokyo Imperial University's Journal of the College of Science, published since 1887, also contained mostly English articles by Japanese physicists (see Table C). We can conclude that by 1900 the physics discipline in Japan was ca pable of autonomous development, even though Japanese physicists still felt the need of further stimulus from Western physics. Postgraduate stu dents, especially those who planned to become university teachers, con tinued to go to Europe for advanced study. When the establishment of Tohoku Imperial University was approved in 1907, almost all members of the proposed science faculty were sent to Europe for further training be fore the College of Science opened in 1911.240 Men like Tanakad ate and Nagaoka visited as many academic and commercial laboratories as possible on their trips to European conferences, and they purchased new scientific instruments abroad to take back with them to Japan. Generally speaking, at this time Japanese physicists tended to work on physics problems that Western physicists worked on, and they continued to do so after 1900. But a new era was beginning. The development of physics after the early 237Seeibid., 3 (1900), p. 400. 238Perhaps the earliest indication that Japanese physics was given serious attention can be found in a conversation recorded by Tanakadate. When he met Heinrich Hertz, probably in 1890, Hertz made complimentary remarks about Japanese physicists saying, "It looks as if from now on we are going to have to learn Japanese. What a problem that is going to be." Possibly Hertz was merely being polite; he was certainly exaggerating. Nevertheless, the remark showed recognition of Japanese achievements. See M. Yoshida, ed., "Tanakadate hakase o kakonde," in Gendai Nihon kiroku zensh? (Tokyo, 1970), 9, 39. 239Tokyo s?gaku butsuri gakkai kiji, 1 (1885), 120. The society doubled its membership every twelve years until World War II. In 1945 when it split into the Physical Society of Japan and the Mathematical Society of Japan, 1,812 of the members were physicists. H.

This period saw the maturation of physics in Japan. Not everyone was happy with the way in which the Japanese were im porting Western science, however. Some foreign science educators in Japan remained skeptical that their efforts had been successful. Erwin von Baelz, a German physician invited to Japan in 1876 to teach medicine at the newly founded University of Tokyo, vividly described his initial enthusi asm and final disenchantment at a celebration in 1900 marking his twenty fifth year of service in Japan: It seems to me that in Japan erroneous conceptions about the origin and nature of western science are widely prevalent. It is regarded as a ma chine which can turn out so much work every year, and therefore, as a machine which can without further ado be transported from the West to any other part of the world there to continue its labours. This is a great mistake. The western scientific world is not a piece of machinery, but an organism, and, like every other organism, if it is to thrive it needs a par ticular climate, a particular atmosphere. . . .241 He went on to say that to achieve the present "mental atmosphere" in the West, great minds labored through the ages to solve the secrets of the uni verse, and their "highway of the human spirit" was watered with their sweat and blood and lighted by execution fires. This spirit that will "sus tain us Europeans until the end of the world"242 cannot be learned in the lecture hall. It can be grasped only by working side by side with other re searchers. He chided his Japanese audience for having often failed to understand the intent of the Western teachers who came to Japan to teach science. The Western teachers "have been looked upon merely as purveyors of scientific fruit, whereas they really were, or wanted to be, the gardeners of science. Often you have expected them to hand over to you the finished 'product' of contemporary science, whereas their business was to sow the seeds out of which in Japan the tree of science could continue its inde pendent growth."243 Baelz's criticism reveals the feeling of superiority over Orientals often 241E.

Baelz's criticism, based upon long experi ence in Japan as a medical teacher, should not be treated lightly. However, in medicine, through its concern with human lives, theory and practice tend to merge more completely than in other sciences. Baelz had little occasion to observe the theoretical work done by Japanese in other sci ences like physics; by evaluating science on the basis of medicine, he no doubt obtained a distorted picture of the contemporary Japanese view of science. It is fair to say that Japan's success in producing the fruits of science was accompanied by continuous Western doubts about the quality of both seed and soil, largely because, despite enormous change, both remained somehow non-Western. In such a context even the "tree of science" seemed a priori an impossibility. There was in Baelz's day the insistence that "true" science is an "organism" that will grow only in one kind of climate, the kind that produced science in the West in the first place. Not only did foreigners such as Baelz believe this, but Japanese intellectuals such as Fukuzawa preached it too. Baelz did not want to be a fruit seller to Japanese ex-samurai; he wanted to "garden" in Japan until he had pre pared a soil recognizably Western. Only then could he trust the soundness of the fruit. Despite such views, two things are clear: no manner of cultivation could possibly transform Japanese soil into that of Europe; and yet still, Japan did, nevertheless, cultivate institutional "trees" that in turn pro duced recognizably Western-style scientists. An important observation by T. Hiroshige suggests reasons why Japan was able to develop these institu tions and scientists without having to meet the impossible demands of men like Baelz and Fukuzawa.245 Although there was a time lapse of two hun dred to three hundred years between the scientific revolution in the West and the period when Japan began to import Western science, the time lapse between the institutionalization of science in the West and in Japan was 244S.

Hiroshige has also noted that the more systematized Western science became in the nineteenth century, the more it shed its original philosophical and cultural aspects and became more readily ex portable.246 Hiroshige contends that these two factors played a key role in the success of the Japanese transplantation of Western science.247 The contention is certainly valid, especially with regard to the role of the University of Tokyo in the development of science in Japan. But the analysis also presents problems. First, it does not take into account the characteristics of the country into which Western science was imported. Although science may have become culturally more neutral and therefore more easily exportable in the nineteenth century, the social, political, and intellectual conditions of the importing country are the decisive factor. One may even ask whether or not it is necessary for science to be stripped of its philosophical and cultural aspects before it can be effectively im ported into a country where the cultural base is quite different. The ob servations of Erwin von Baelz throw some light on the subject. Indeed, if we accept at face value Baelz's criticism of the Japanese attitude toward the study of Western science, we must conclude that it was the Japanese themselves who stripped Western science of its philosophical and cultural aspects when they imported it. It is important, too, to realize that the successful importation of science into Japan between 1868 and the 1920's, cannot be viewed in isolation from the other social and political changes taking place at that time. Japan had transformed itself into a unified political state, and by 1910 it had won two major wars and thus tested its strength as a modern nation. Japan had survived the onslaught of Western pressure, which had been its motiva tion for modernization in the first place. The successful institutionalization of science in Japan was not merely due to the shortness of the fifty-year lapse between it and the institutionalization of science in the West, but was part of the larger Japanese success in modernization. Without this broader view many aspects of Japanese physics?the success of the Tokyo School of Physics, for example?cannot be understood properly. Despite their shortcomings, Hiroshige's observations are the most important to have emerged from studies of the development of science in Japan. 246Such science, he says, is what Thomas Kuhn calls "normal science."
