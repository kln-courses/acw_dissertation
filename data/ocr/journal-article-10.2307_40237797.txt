<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophical Implications of Ernesto Grassi: A New Foundation of Philosophy? Charles L. Fierz, Attorney Do Ernesto Grassi's writings offer a new philosophical founda- tion? The philosophical importance he assigns to rhetoric, espe- cially to metaphor, invites the task of examining his rôle as a contemporary philosopher. This invitation is both compelling and unique because Grassi chooses to limit himself to asserting the contributions of Renaissance Italian Humanism to rhetoric and philosophy and because he treats humanism not as literature, but as suggesting a foundational sensé, or core, of philosophy. Despite the potential contemporary relevance of Grassi's ideas, particu- larly as they contrast with scientific or metaphysical thought, no essays elaborating on them philosophically, or using them method- ologically, hâve appeared (Foss, Foss, and Trapp 1985, 64). This essay attempts to begin to elaborate Grassi's philosophical implica- tions, chiefly by contrasting them with those of Heidegger and existentialism, in order to show that, although Grassi philosophi- cally reinterprets Humanism through rhetoric, this reinterpreta- tion does not give rise to a new foundation of philosophy because of the limitations of his rhetorical perspective. Like Heidegger and thè existentialists, Grassi is anti-science, finding that the formulas and logicai methods of science hâve valid- ity only within its own System and cannot validly answer questions about the truth of what is being investigated (Grassi 1983, 13). Thus, according to Grassi, modem life lacks truth and may be seen as surrendering cultural narrative to "technology, finding meaning and purpose through analytically derived technology" (Verity 1992, 16). Professionally, Grassi was first a teacher of Italian literature. His study of Italian Renaissance Humanism led him to his view of rhetoric's prééminent rôle. Prior to the Renaissance, rhetoric had practically ceased to exist. Apparently, Petrarch inaugurated the revival of classical rhetoric when he discovered Cicero's orations in the fourteenth Century. In 1440, Aristotle's Rhetoric was trans- Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 27, No. 2, 1994.

George of Trebizond's Rhetoricum and Lorenzo Valla's Dialectica systematically organized rhetoric, giving it an emphasis on logic that may hâve led to the belief that the rhetoric revival was associated with science. Petrarch, however, was anti-science and logic was for him only a component of rhetoric, only part of a humanistic éducation consisting of grammar, poetry, history, and moral philosophy as well (Rabil 1988; see also Kristeller 1967). As humanism spread from Italy, it became associated everywhere with a revival of Platonism, which Grassi believes reached its culmina- tion in thè works of Giambattista Vico, whom Grassi refers to in virtually all of his writings for his views on the relationship between rhetoric and philosophy: At thè end of thè humanist period Vico - in whose théories: "the whole humanist tradition reached its highest philosophical conscious- ness . . . tries to reestablish the connection between philosophy and rhetoric and at thè same time, to reinstate the humanistic branches of knowledge . . . by rendering their philosophical significance." (Foss, Foss, and Trapp 1985, 149, citing Grassi in Rhetoric and Philosophy) In thus reviving the humanist tradition, Grassi asserts the primacy of rhetorical language over rational language and thus over the entire scientific tradition. It is necessary to focus on Grassi's unique concerns with the relationship between rhetoric and philosophy. He is not con- cerned with content or with the politicai or persuasive aspects of rhetoric; instead, he is concerned with the poetic, and with the power of the image to evoke, not just literary, but philosophical insight. Indeed, for Grassi, the metaphorical image is ontology, the foundation of human thought, which he "pulls out" of rheto- ric. This is quite différent from thè usuai récognition of rhetoric's philosophical component, but it is, in effect, the récognition of philosophy 's rhetorical component. Cicero and Petrarch had long ago noted this expedience-"tool" function of rhetoric, while Piato and Aristotle noted the content function (Seigal 1968, 9). Grassi approaches rhetoric, not as rational thinking, but as awareness itself: he joins rhetorical éloquence to philosophy and concludes that the two are the same, revealed somehow in the "poetical word" by metaphor. With its thesis of the prééminence of the rational déduction of beings, Grassi's conclusion about rhetoric bringing awareness</page><page sequence="3">106 CHARLES L. FIERZ through metaphor posits thè end of rational metaphysics and strikes a lethal blow at thè déification of science in thè contempo- rary world: The problem of thè essence of thè human genius and of its creativity cannot be reduced to that of rational déduction, which modern tech- nology is developing to improbable depths. (Grassi 1969, 43) Though Grassi states that "thè topic of our investigation is thè con- temporary relevance of Italian Humanism and its problems" (Grassi 1983, 17), his writings suggest broader philosophical concerns - particularly indicating disdain for German Idealismi stale rational- ism, similarly dealing with Heidegger, and, ali thè while, pleading for a proper appréciation of humanism's rejection of thè rational and its récognition of thè poetic through rhetoric. Grassi claims that thè "moving, insightful, originai" meaning of thè classics was first uncovered by thè humanist Leonardi Bruni (1369-1444), who, while translating ancient Greek texts, carne to thè discovery that thè meaning of a terni can be derived only from thè "discovery of its sense only in thè context of thè relationship in which it stands" - that it has no rational définition in itself . Bruni explained that "genuine" speech is not reason, but "adaptability, acuteness, momentariness, determined by in venti veness or imagi- nation," thè kind of speech found in rhetoric. Grassi called this thè "breaking of thè primacy of logicai thought whereby rhetoric be- comes thè genuine form of language"(1983, 19). Following Bruni, a similar kind of insight, according to Grassi, led Dante to observe that imaginative speech - poetry - is real speech and that "thè ex- périence of thè poetic word is thè origin of human historicity" (Grassi 1983, 18). It also led Boccaccio not only to note poetry's "veiled reality," as opposed to thè unreality of so-called real things, but also to note thè reality of fables. Salutati, too, consid- ered thè philosophical truth of poetry's "un-hidden-ness" (Grassi 1983, 22-24), giving rise to Vico's assertion that thè classics had been misinterpreted: For this reason Vico pointed out that thè philosophers and philolo- gists should have begun with study of poetic wisdom, which was thè first truth of thè heathen, in thè investigation of ancient wisdom, and not with thè abstract and reasoned truths of thè scholars. (Grassi 1983, 22-24) The discoveries with which Grassi crédits Bruni and his humanist successors are really only thè discovery of thè metaphor - that fig-</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 107 ure of speech that, as used ontologically, Grassi claims marks the end of metaphysics. This claim puts Grassi in direct opposition to the German Idealists, who denied that the metaphor - being only a sensé perception and not a true "thought," not a logicai conception, just a feeling - had philosophical importance. Hegel called the me- taphor an "untrue form" since it "remained at the lower level of externalities which only mind is capable of grasping in its rational content" (Grassi 1978, 88). Hegel's "rational content" is, of course, scientific thinking, which is what Grassi rejects, pref erring, instead, a "logic" that rests "conveying meanings and metaphor as the origin and basis of the interprétation of sensory phenomena, in contrast to rational logic; a logic of images and metaphors" (Grassi 1978, 93). Metaphor, then, is for Grassi the foundation of the perception of existence, the way in which humans actually work and become "hu- manized," using their ingeniousness to found social and politicai institutions and to convey (inferentially through poetry and the arts) human meaning, "reality characterized by urgency and intermin- ability" (Grassi 1978, 94). Thus verbalized, the metaphor is the key to Grassi's theory, often appearing in the form of "folly," "games," or thè "joke" (Grassi 1986, 131), but, nevertheless, standing as his ontology. Because Heidegger, also, devoted considérable attention to the importance of poetry and poetic image, Grassi, in his search for the foundation of knowledge, takes great pains to separate himself from Heidegger on this issue, overlooking the possible perspec- tives of others, such as Sartre and the existentialists. Grassi's effort involves the following propositions (the first two of which he calls Heidegger's "twofold thesis"): (1) Heidegger does not share Grassi's view that the discovery of the importance of the poetic and the metaphorical is attributable to the Humanists. (2) Heidegger's analysis is stili that of a rationalist philosopher; by missing the importance of humanism, Heidegger erroneously assumed that he was the "criticai break" with Western rational deductive metaphysics. (3) Since Grassi properly interpreted the humanists' interpréta- tion of the importance of the poetic and metaphorical to classical rhetoric, Grassi is that "criticai break" (Grassi 1983, 11). To examine thèse propositions, one must review Heidegger's thought and grapple with a fourth proposition, namely, what is the relationship of existentialism to the above three propositions?</page><page sequence="5">108 CHARLES L. FIERZ As to proposition one, Grassi quotes Heidegger as claiming that " 'through thè work of art as essent being, everything else that appears and is found is first confirmed and made accessible, expli- cable, and understandable as being or not being.' " And, " 'We do not learn who man is by erudite définitions . . . [but] when he créâtes original poetry, when he builds poetically' " (Grassi 1983, 26-27). These words seem similar to Vico's, but Heidegger states that humanism is not actually true post-metaphysical philosophy because it does not ask profoundly (presumably in thè way that Heidegger does) about Being's relationship to man and his essen- tial nature. It " 'hinders this question, neither recognizing it nor understanding it' " (Grassi 1983, 26-27, quoting Heidegger). As to proposition two, Heidegger had six définitions of being, ali admittedly contradictory (Grassi 1983), 1 which, according to Grassi, prove that he, Heidegger, and not thè humanists, failed to recognize or understand the true (noncontradictory for Grassi) nature of Being; he feels that Heidegger did not "break from" rational metaphysics, but was inherently caught up in its typically contradictory methods. Perhaps Heidegger is talking philosophy and Grassi poetry and nothing more; thèse questions are, at any rate, more complex for Heidegger (and Sartre and existentialism) than for Grassi. Apparently, Heidegger intends to be investigat- ing that which cornes before Grassi's metaphor, a priori ontology or foundation, however difficult and objectionably described. He intends to be equally as nonlogical as Grassi, to be equally as involved with the first moment of human awareness; Heidegger implies that metaphor is an act after that awareness, after the awareness of the whole world, not only of a word or words, but of the total environment one is born into and toward which one may use such "tools" as metaphor (Kaelin 1988, 75). Heidegger candidly acknowledges the limitation of mere words to describe human existence as he tries to adapt Husserl's phenomenology to the task of portraying "events in the world insofar as a subject is aware of them" (Kaelin 1988, 74). Whether or not he overcomes the limitation of words is debatable, but Heidegger seems to be, in good faith, trying to avoid the methods of rational metaphys- ics, not to utilize them, as Grassi seems to assert. As to proposition three, is Grassi the "real break" with rational metaphysics? Or, is Grassi, first trained as a teacher of Italian literature, using rhetoric in a literary sensé (certainly rhetoric may be defined many ways)2 and, therefore, emphasizing metaphor</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 109 because of his perspective? Is he, even though he also has a philo- sophical background, elevating metaphor, a mere figure of speech, to the level of a philosophical foundation? Heidegger's accomplish- ment, like that of the existentialists generally, is to try to create an ontology, with language, but without rational metaphysics. Such an accomplishment does not necessarily exclude metaphor; it uses metaphor as a communicative device, not as a substitute for a System. In order to de termine whether Grassi distorts metaphor, one must probe further into his philosophical insights, which in- clude considérable références to theological and religious ideas in addition to literary perspective. One also must discuss existential- ism's ontological perspective. Both Heidegger and the existentialists (at least as represented by Sartre, for purposes of discussion) place metaphor after ontology is first established, established clumsily, to be sure, by language that acknowledges itself to be incapable of Being itself . According to Sartre, this is pre-reflective, pre-Cartesian, pre-metaphorical (pre- metaphysical) language. It is, he says, thè "pre-reflective cogito," which is itself not capable of being reflected upon because it is not an object or a consciousness. Sartre's ontological foundation, this pre- reflective cogito, is the "imaginative act, (but not just metaphor), constituting, isolating, and nihilating," allowing, experiencing, against a negative background (Sartre 1956, xv). His foundation does more than metaphor, seems to corne before it, and is "directed at the world as a whole rather than at particular perceptions of images, a total being-in-the-world" (Sartre 1956, xv), which has to be. For Sartre, a human's being "has meaning only in the light of the future toward which he projects himself . Thus, he is not, at any one instant, what he wants to be or what he is said to be and he is that to which he projects himself but which he is not yet" (Sartre 1956, xxii). Ethical "bad faith" results from a human's interprétation of and attempi to guide, by rational processes, so to speak, his or her being. Sartre's nihilating pre-reflective cogito goes deeper, it may be argued, than Heidegger's six, contradictory, negating, définitions of being. As Sartre's translator, Hazel Barnes, points out: [Heidegger's view] cannot account for the Non-being which is in- volved in every question, in every negative judgment, in prohibi- tions, in ideas like "destruction" and "distance." Both Hegel and Heidegger, Sartre objects, hâve talked about Nothingness without providing a being in which this Nothingness is founded and which can establish the négations affected by this nihilating power. In short</page><page sequence="7">110 CHARLES L. FIERZ they both neglect thè structure of the human mind or consciousness. (Sartre 1956, xxii) It is unfortunate that Grassi does not address himself to Sartre and consciousness because Sartre's extensive, 798-page treatment of ontology, Being and Nothingness, clearly indicates that his pre- reflective cogito, as consciousness, occurs prior to Heidegger's on- tological ideas, and is more original. Grassi's arguments in support of the originality of metaphor, therefore, should hâve been di- rected at his real Opponent, Sartre. Sartre deals with the nature of Grassi's concerns, with thè "power of the image," but distinguishes and overwhelms them. For example, Sartre describes imagination as a négation of the world - which could be construed as being analogous to perceiving a metaphor - but for Sartre, the nature of that world itself is called into question. His world idea is not static; it is a dynamic world that is a "surpassing," an opposite, because of its own négation of something real: It appears that the image is a surpassing of the world that is in turn a surpassing of the real. Sartre argues that the image can surpass the world [présent itself as unreal] only if the world is already understood itself as a surpassing of the real. (Fell 1979, 69) The missing élément in Grassi's approach is his failure to define the world, or the world as "négation of real," as a part of knowl- edge précèdent to or a priori the metaphor, or as related to consciousness. This élément, notably, is glossed ο ver also by Heidegger. Joseph Fell has observed that Sartre's world négation of the real cornes close to imagination: It appears that the image is a surpassing of the "world" that is in turn a surpassing of the "real." Sartre is arguing that the image can "surpass" the world [présent itself as unreal] only if the world is already understood as itself a surpassing of the real. To "surpass" something is for Sartre, to "negate" it. To surpass something is to understand that the surpassing is other than (trans-) what is sur- passed and the surpassed is other than the surpassing; in Sartre's terms, there is a relation of négation between the surpassing and the surpassed. (1979, 68-69) AH of thèse words cause Fell to suggest that Sartre flirts with the methods of rational metaphysics to explain the reality of imagina- tion, which, of course, is simply unexplainable, according to Grassi. His unique choice of words along with his efforts to set</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 111 himself apart from rational metaphysics, however, makes it appar- ent that Sartre did not intend to be a rational metaphysician. In his book Heidegger and Renaissance Humanism, Grassi shows évi- dence of knowing that the existentialists were, generally, attempt- ing something new; nevertheless, he mentions only Heidegger, and no other existentialist, and criticizes Heidegger's method as estab- lishing being in a particular situation by rationality. Presumably, Grassi would label Sartre's methods, too, as mere rationality; the "imagination line" between Sartre and Grassi is thin and unex- plored: Grassi says only that he "leaves behind thè usuai under- standing of existentialism as we know it through Sartre, Merleau- Ponty, or Camus" (Grassi 1983, 32). Though he does not cali himself an existentialist, Heidegger was given that label by Sartre in a 1945 lecture. Ironically, Heidegger retorted to Sartre in a letter written in 1947, which Grassi purports to hâve published. This séries of events lends credence to thè idea that Grassi knew of Sartre's positions and could hâve offered his own comparative opinion on the Sartre- Heidegger ontological debate, but did not, choosing to leave oth- ers to examine his philosophical implications only in light of Heidegger, and choosing also to ignore thè basic ontological inves- tigation of the existentialists. Before turning back to Grassi's différences with Heidegger in more détail, it is important to note the clarification by Heidegger in his letter issued in 1947 after Sartre's lecture, with respect to language revealing being as a singularity. According to Fell: Heidegger's clarification of his own thinking and its relation to Sartre's position is centered on a single notion - the primacy, or ruling and grounding power, of Being in history through language. The "turn" has in essence consisted in "seeing through" nothing to Being, in comprehending nothing as the "veil of being, in regarding nothing as the self-dissimulation of and by Being itself." The appar- ent emptiness of Being, its appearance as a nihil that Sartre can interpret as "lack," a hole to be plugged by man is the appearance of Being in the mode of self-dissimulation. [But] the apparent empti- ness of nothing is a concealed fullness and we are on a plane where there is primarily being. Being is good, the clearing itself, world. . . . The "turn" has in essence consisted in seeing through nothing to Being, in comprehending nothing as "the veil of Being." (1979, 168, emphasis added) It can be seen that Heidegger rejects Sartre's "double néga- tion," the first being the négation as the world is perceived as</page><page sequence="9">112 CHARLES L. FIERZ other; thè second being the world as négation or surpassing itself . Heidegger views both négations as one - the becoming of Being itself. As one becoming, the Heideggerian view cornes close to Grassi's imagination, just as Sartre at times seems to be dealing only with imagination. Heidegger's perspective on language, how- ever, unlike Sartre's, is literary, with attention to the meaning of the poetic. This attention to thè poetic no doubt caused Grassi to hâve a special interest in him. Sartre, of course, did considérable creative writing - plays, novels, and the like - but his philosophi- cal writings do not reveal thè creative or poetic as a source and, therefore, may not have attracted Grassi's poetic perspective as Heidegger's writings did. Heidegger, in his quest for philosophical meaning in language and the poetic, dwelt on the nature of poetic thought, having been influenced by the poet Hölderlin; through Goethe he often turned to poetry for évidence of his arguments and to assist in his teaching (Bernasconi 1985, 30). His essay, The Origen of the Work of Art may be seen as an attempt to develop a vocabulary appropriate to aesthetics, reflecting, yet not describing ratio- nally, aesthetic expérience. Heidegger's attempt is, essentially, to describe the indescribable, something that Grassi seems unwill- ing to be drawn into, pref erring to let poetry, through metaphor, speak for itself. Grassi cloaks poetry in such terms as immedi- acy; as the founding of truth, of God, and so forth; as opposed to mediate, rational, language (Bernasconi 1985, 37). Such terms seem to describe what poetry does, rather than what it is; Grassi tries to avoid falling back on rational metaphysics by ref erring to poetry as originary language, the language of Being, whereby the poet "names the holy" (Bernasconi 1985, 37). The Origen of the Work of Art présents a side of Heidegger that approaches the world not substantially unlike Grassi, not unlike Renaissance Humanism, since "originary" may be interpreted similarly to Grassi's metaphorical imagination, calling into ques- tion metaphysical modes of thinking. This is how Bernasconi présents Heidegger: The ability to say what metaphysics is, is granted only to those who are no longer bound by metaphysics in the sensé of being within it; they can only say what it no longer is. Similarly, when it is said who the poet and the thinker are, to be a poet or thinker becomes something différent. To say who poet and thinker are in terms of aesthetics and metaphysics respectively, and at the same time to</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 113 show the inner unity of aesthetics and metaphysics, is to présent the conditions for a radical questioning of the very distinction between poet and thinker, a questioning that has its source in the dialogue between them. (1985, 46) Heidegger's interest in poetry surfaced in thè late 1950s in a séries of lectures on the poet Stefan George, wherein a poet is described as renouncing his control over words and things and their relationship, while Being is seen as "true" expérience, fleet- ing, evanescent, incapable of description. Heidegger also has dis- cussed metaphysics in his essay What is Metaphysics? (Bernasconi 1985, 34). Like Grassi, Heidegger addressed Renaissance Hu- manism, but only to give the impression that he places it in the rational metaphysical tradition. Therefore, Grassi criticizes Hei- degger for not realizing that poetry interested the Renaissance humanists in the sensé that they saw it as the foundation of know- ledge. Without attending to the perspective of the humanists, Grassi believes, Heidegger and, presumably, Sartre are lost - floundering about in a sea of words that futilely attempt to de- scribe thè indescribable. Grassi clearly distinguishes his humanist point of view of the value of poetry and metaphor from Hei- degger's, and he also clearly indicates why he, Grassi, chooses to "rest his case" relative to the humanist foundation of human thought, rather than to explore its implications by entering the land of the indescribable, to undertake the subject of ontology thoroughly. Instead of erecting his own ontology, Grassi implies the suprem- acy of his view of the foundation of philosophical thought by at- tempting to destroy Heidegger's twofold thesis: (1) The End of Philosophy, and (2) The Dawning of Poetic Speech. This attempt allows Grassi, first, to knock out the first part of that thesis by agreeing that traditional philosophy is irrelevant and, second, to move to the primacy of poetic speech and place its proper origin in Renaissance Humanism. This second part of Grassi's attempted destruction of Heidegger's thesis is of particular interest, for he states that Heidegger erroneously finds his historical antécédents in fragments of the pre-Socratic, prior to rational metaphysical thought: Heidegger's point is his interprétation of the fragments from Parmen- ides and Heraclitus and of the chorus in Sophocles' Antigone as well as, finally, the poems of Hölderlin and Trakl. From there he cornes to</page><page sequence="11">114 CHARLES L. FIERZ offer thè thesis that thè poet is thè one who founds thè time and thè piace of being there. (Grassi 1983, 13) In contrast, Grassi's starting point is always Renaissance Human- ism, starting with Bruni's translations and culminating, except for Grassi's personal theology, with Vico: The essence of humanism is thè rediscovery of man and his immanent values. This widespread interprétation is, for example, thè reason why - as we shall see - repeatedly engaged in polemics against hu- manism as a naive anthropomorphism. . . . One of thè centrai prob- lems of humanism, however, is not man, but thè question of thè original context, thè "horizon or openness" in which man and his world appear. The amazing thing, usually overlooked, is that these Problems are not dealt with in humanism by means of a logicai specu- lative confrontation with traditional metaphysics, but rather in terms of thè analysis and interprétation of language, especially poetic lan- guage. (1983, 17) Why did Heidegger "overlook" thè humanism that Grassi found so criticai to turn to? The answer may lie in thè differing disciplin- ary traditions that each scholar carne from. Grassi was a teacher of literature, and though educated as a philosopher, repeatedly identi- fies himself with rhetoric; Heidegger's perspective is philosophical and at times theological, using literature and poetry more spar- ingly. Further, whether or not Heidegger calls himself an existen- tialist, he has been identified with that philosophical movement. Nowhere does Heidegger claim to have anything to do with rheto- ric as a discipline unto itself . It is his rhetorical background that "favors" Grassi's perspective. It is also thè factor that limits his ability to take a fully developed philosophical perspective. Grassi contends that rhetoric "passes" for philosophy in an onto- logical sense by declaring that rhetoric initially détermines how speech is formed, prior to reason. For example, he states that rhetoric détermines thè first premise in a syllogism and that rea- son, through logic, only calculâtes thè conclusion from thè minor premise. But rhetoric is not so originai: each part of a persuasive effort, to be appealing, must contain attractive images, metaphors. It does not, therefore, attain its truth as ontology, but is an embel- lishment that may help lead to truth. Even Grassi seems to ac- knowledge this, pointing out that "poetry has thè power to lead human beings beyond thè sensés so that a discrepancy arises be- tween what thè sensés perceive and this new, revealed truth"</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 1 15 (1978, 94). For Grassi, thè sensés, apparently, process rhetoric, and this process is ontology. Without further explanation, Grassi's "system" is not unlike common sensé and certainly lacks the philo- sophical rigor of Heidegger or the existentialists. In the final analy- sis, Grassi deals with Heidegger's twofold thesis by off ering no alternative but to extol Vico over and over again. Having disposed of both metaphysics and Heidegger's use of poetry by resorting to Vico in order to indicate what his foundation of thought is not, Grassi takes a tentative step further, a step into "negative theology," which for Grassi substi tûtes for ontology; he off ers his spéculation as to how he, Grassi, would develop the implications of his views philosophically if he chose to do so. Grassi takes the negative theology step in the chapter entitled "Overturning of Religious Meaning" in his book, Heidegger and Renaissance Humanism. Setting up his "theology," Grassi reem- phasizes, directly before this chapter, that metaphor is his entire System, that "it is the rescue, there is no other kind . . . without metaphor, man, faced with urgencies by Being threatening to push him into the abyss, would most certainly be destroyed" (1983, 76). Grassi then argues, essentially, that Heidegger knows that meta- phor is the truth, the only correct System, by quoting to the effect that "God's appearance through the heavens consists of an expo- sure that allows what is to be concealed to be visible" (1983, 76). Grassi accuses Heidegger of "overturning" this religious truth by allowing metaphysical thinking to creep into his philosophy. Grassi's "overturning" chapter begins with a patient réitération of traditional metaphysics' failing - that it rationally describes rela- tions between Beings. He then states that Heidegger feil into such a failing by attempting to go behind, or before, metaphor as Being, by attempting to describe its unhiddenness, by attempting to formu- late a theory: "Before this question can be posed, philosophy, if it is to provide a foundation of its activity, must precede this with a theory of knowl- edge or consciousness, remaining on a path so that it is in the antechanger of philosophy and does not turn around its center." (Grassi 1983, 77, quoting Heidegger) This theory of consciousness is, of course, what Sartre also feit was necessary to a foundation of human knowledge, but what Grassi, relying on Italian Humanism, does not. Grassi asserts that the real issue is truth, the same issue posed by Plato's interprétation of</page><page sequence="13">116 CHARLES L. FIERZ Socrates, and that there is no theory or metaphysical capaci ty to deal with such an issue. Grassi approaches his theology and steers clear of metaphysics by distinguishing between "attitude" and "capacity." He points out that Heidegger sensed this distinction by purporting to phi- losophize about attitudes instead of about such capacities as memory, knowledge, and will - which all employ rational think- ing. Grassi, however, refines thè idea of attitudes by breaking it down into belief, hope, and openness - a breaking down that is not unlike Heidegger's attempi to describe Being, a breaking down that is accomplished, of course, by metaphysical-type lan- guage, but that breaks down into simple love. Love, for Grassi, is, thus, constituted of belief, hope, and openness, the three theological virtues associated with Western thought. Love, for Grassi, is thè set of virtues that comprise an ethical attitude that combines with metaphor into the foundation of human knowl- edge. Love is Grassi's way out of discussing his own philosophical implications. Grassi's belief, hope, and love attitude allows him to "step out of the day of rationality to the night of the abyss of Being." In sup- port of this "negative theology," Grassi turns to Dionysius the Areopagite (fifth Century A.D.) and John of the Cross (1542-91): Dionysius distinguishes between three forms of theology or ways of making assertions about God. The one speaks about God by rational arguments that give us "grounds" and names God with names that everyone can understand. He calls this a positive theology. The sec- ond kind, which Dionysius calls "symbolic," speaks of God in terms of "unsimilar similarities." It speaks of the divine through images that can be grasped through the sensés. The third kind of theology Diony- sius calls "negative." This recognizes that every word or proposition about God is actually an impossibility; we cannot name him or speak about God. Negative theology leads from the sphère of what can be "established" as a being, the sphère where logic is decisive, to a higher sphère where rational language and thought can no longer be regarded as decisive. (1983, 87) In other words, for negative theology, one must enter the dark- ness of what for rationality is not knowledge and must express himself, as in the case of John of the Cross, in poetic language, so that God is understood as that which originally speaks to us, but which cannot be thought of logically or spoken of in logicai terms. Grassi asserts without hésitation that John of the Cross is the</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 1 17 manifestation of the attitude of belief, hope, and openness, replac- ing the capacity of knowledge, memory, and will, the epitome of ontology. Grassi makes several claims for the theological importance of the writings of John of the Cross, including citations from his poems, such as "The Living Flame of Love." The most notable claim, however, and the one that most appears to undercut the force of Grassi's argument that metaphor is a complete founda- tion of human knowledge is Grassi's assertion that John of the Cross "finds the historicity of God in the unique phenomenon of Christ" (1983, 90). In ail of Grassi's works, this statement is found only at the end of Heidegger and Renaissance Humanism, in connection with Grassi's discussion of attitude. It is new terri- tory, to be sure, and is the final weapon that Grassi uses to try to demolish Heidegger by indicating that, presumably by not moving onto such viewpoints as that of John of the Cross and Christ, Heidegger is still situated in the territory of rational capacity and that his "sublimity" is in a "fundamentally différent sensé, for in negative theology the sublime and the elevated nature of God are defined as finally made visible only by relinquishing the rational capacities" (1983, 90). Having given thè reader a glimpse, through discussion of atti- tude, negative theology, John of the Cross, and mention of Christ, that the implications of his thought involve more than metaphor and the influence of Renaissance Humanism, Grassi concludes Heidegger and Renaissance Humanism by summarizing three types of philosophy, including Heidegger, but not including existential- ism by name. This summarization is apparently as close as one can get to Grassi's own conception of his thought compared to existen- tialism; the inference is that Heidegger represents, for Grassi, a point of view that is not unlike existentialism generally, despite the différences between Sartre and Heidegger that I hâve pointed out. The three types of philosophy are as follows: (1) Metaphysics: This is the language of reason, of science, ask- ing only about relationships between beings. (2) Negative Theology: This rejects the primacy of rational thought and identifies Being with God as not rationally definable. The poetic word allows access to Being conceived in an unhis- torical sensé, metaphorical thought furthering the "platonic form" of thought that opposes the historical. (3) (et al): Being is uncovered in its unhiddenness, but at the</page><page sequence="15">118 CHARLES L. FIERZ same time its claim must be established in a particular setting by rationality. Neither limiting oneself to the recollection of Being nor the déniai of beings, as in thè case of negative theology, nor adhering to the primacy of the rational, as in the case of the metaphysics of being, can lead us to the solution of unhiddenness (Grassi 1983, 92). Faced with thèse three types of philosophy, thè reader can con- clude only that Grassi's préférence is negative theology, which, as Grassi has explained it, is certainly more than metaphor but, with such éléments as John of the Cross and Christ, is certainly nothing new philosophically. It is clear that Grassi has nothing in common with metaphysics, but equally clear is the fact that, despite their common nonscientific, subjective approaches, Grassi's view and the Heideggerian view differ in theology, with Grassi, in the final analysis, finding Christian theology behind negative theology. Christ, not the metaphor, is, implicitly, Grassi's ontology. It would take volumes to discuss the implications of this, but it is fair to say that Grassi's ideas about the foundation of philosophical thought are not really new and do not necessarily emanate from Renais- sance Humanism. Grassi's rhetorical emphasis - using metaphor as a starting point - is unique; but to claim, through resort to Christian theology, that he has a new philosophical foundation of human thought, with little explanation except as the afterthought to a book on Heidegger and Renaissance Humanism, exaggerates thè scope of rhetoric and raises more questions than it answers. Grassi's description of a foundation of philosophy rests not upon the "new," solid ground of metaphor, but, instead, upon the shaky ground of his own theology. Conclusion Donald Verene has written two articles praising Grassi for his unique view of Renaissance thought, not as literature, but as phi- losophy and for his récognition that rhetoric is necessary to argu- ment . . . that "narrative is argument's lifeblood" . . . that argu- ments are not "interesting in themselves," as philosophers in the analytic tradition claim (Verene 1989, 143; 1986, 134). Massimo Marassi has noted how Grassi's view of rhetoric as philosophy brings out the human, finite, momentariness of philosophical in- sight (1986, 256), and Walter Veit has credited Grassi with "recon- structing thè historical background in which the debate about the</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GRASSI 119 status of rational and non-rational truth took place" (1986, 239). No writer has criticized Grassi, and, to be fair, thè comments of Verene, Marassi, and Veit are well taken - as comments address- ing particular aspects of Grassi's writings. The fact remains, however, that no essays hâve addressed Grassi's quest for a new foundation of philosophy. Grassi himself does not fully address the philosophical implications of that quest and by turning to "nega- tive theology" seems to avoid such implications. Because he limits his concerns to the contributions of Italian Renaissance Humanism to rhetoric and philosophy, Grassi has not succeeded in offering a new foundation of philosophy.
