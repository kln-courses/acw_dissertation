<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRANSITION FROM PRECLASSIC TO CLASSIC AT TEOTIHUACAN MICHAEL WEST ABSTRACT Four years of intensive archaeological survey, supple- mented by excavations in the TeotihuacAn Valley, Mexico, have greatly clarified our piicture of the transition from Preclassic to Classic. The definition of two new phases of culture history, Tezoyuca and Patlachique, that belong to the Terminal Preclassic (post Late Ticoman) strongly suggesits a local development of the great Classic city of Teotihuacan. This runs counter to the hypothes;is that a great migration, possibly from the Gulf Coast region, was responsible for the fully developed Classic TeotihuacAn culture. Present evidence indicates that the Patlachique phase is intrusive and appears in the Teotihuacan Valley possibly as the result of migrations from the southern Valley of Mexico, perhaps precipitated by the eruption of the volcano Xitli. When peoples carrying this culture entered the Teotihuacan Valley, they encountered the Tezoyuca culture and gradually absorbed it. The fusion of these two groups eventually produced Tzacualli, which is the first recognizable phase of the Teotihuacan culture. A SSESSING the historical interrelationships 1I. between the Preclassic and the Classic re- mains a major problem in the prehistory of the Valley of Mexico in general and of the Valley of Teotihuacain in particular. One school of thought attempts to explain these interrelation- ships in terms of large-scale migrations from distant areas. A second explains these relation- ships as arising from purely local processes with each cultural period having its roots in the pre- vious one. This paper is an investigation of the above problem and will attempt to expand the latter theory by utilizing data gathered during the past four years by the Teo,tihuacain Valley Project. However, it must be made clear that I am cognizant of the many possibilities and alter- natives that exist as explanations of the relation- ships in question and that the following is but a single and perhaps narrow approach to this problem. It has often been stated in the studies of the archaeology of the Valley of Mexico that the great Classic city of Teotihuacan represents a complete break or a new tradition Tzacualli (Armillas 1950) oir Teotihuac'an I Phase (Vai- lIant 1944) as the early material from its interior was designated. They contended that the struc- ture was built in the Classic period which fol- lowed Tzacualli, advancing this theory not only on the basis olf ceramic differences but also on the absence of other specific Classic traits, that is, art and architecture in other Late Preclassic sites. The general absence of Tzacualli occupa- tion in the vicinity of the Sun Pyramid also supported this argument. Noguera (1935: 75-7, 95) believed that the Tzacualli material represented the remains of a small Preclassic population that lived at Teo- tihuacan before the construction of the Pyramid. Vaillant (1938: 540-2, 560-1) reached substan- tially the same conclusion. Linne (1942: 182-3) concluded that the gap in the style of ceramics between Tzacualli and the later Classic phases was so great as to suggest a population displace- ment. It was generally accepted that the mate- rial from the interior of the Sun Pyramid was unrelated to the subsequent growth of Teotihua- can. It was postulated that the later Classic civilization which appeared was the result of a massive, large-scale migration of people from a distant region, perhaps the Gulf Coiast, carrying the fully developed Teotihuacan culture. War- ren (1962: 296) feels that the Tzacualli or Teo- tihuacan I phase might have been a "site unit intrusion" which was formational to Teotihua- can civilization. Millon (1960: 6) is not certain whether there was a migration from the Remo- jadas region of Central Veracruz to Teotihuacan, or just technological and stylistic diffusion. However, there are several factors which point to certain fallacies in the large-scale migration theory. First, no area outside the Valley of Mex- ico is known to possess Classic Teotihuacan traits, except in cases of trade, and this was contemporary with an already-flourishing cul- ture at Teo'tihuacan. By all indications there is no point of origin of Classic Teo,tihuacan traits outside the Valley of Mexico;. Secondly, no sherds of Classic pottery have been found in the interior of the Sun Pyramid. If the Pyramid was indeed built during the Classic period, then it is almost certain that some Classic pottery would have been mixed in the fill (Kidder and others 1946: 118). Millon (1960: 6) first placed the construction of the Pyramid in the Tzacualli phase but, after initiation of intensive survey of the urban zone at Teo,tihuacan, he asserts that it now appears that the temple was built to its present height at the end of Tzacualli and the beginning of Mic- caotli or Vaillant's Teotihuacain II (Millon 1964: 348-9). Sherds that resemble Miccaotli pottery 193</page><page sequence="2">194 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 2,1965 have occurred in samples from the interior of the upper stages of the Pyramid. It is quite pos- sible that these fragments are transi tional in con- trast to earlier rural Preclassic cultures. Noguera (1935) excavated a tunnel in the Pyramid of the Sun, the largest temple at Teotihuacan, and brought to light a unique ceramic complex dif- ferent from that of Classic Teotihuacan. This discovery raised the problem of dating the con- struction of the Pyramid, since the structure is architecturally integrated into the plan of the city and appears to be in the general Classic tradition. The pottery from the tunnel seemed similar to that from Late Ticoman as defined by Vaillant (1931). In addition, there was no known residential area in the zone that con- tained these unusual ceramics. Later, Noguera (1943) excavated at Chimal- huacan, a small village site on the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, where he revealed another pottery complex that was distinctive because it was similar to material from the Sun Pyramid but also resembled Late Ticoman po,ttery. Thus there were two groups of ceramics that were distinct but yet showed ties among themselves and with Late Ticoman. It was hypothesized that these materials from the Sun Pyramid and Chimalhuacan either represented a final phase of the Preclassic and were therefore after Late Ticoman or were regional variants of the latter and contemporaneous with it. Nearly all investigators at that stage of re- search were reluctant to place the building of the Sun Pyramid between Tzacualli and Miccaotli. Bennyhoff (personal communication) has de- fined this transitional phase further on the basis of survey material from Teo,tihuacan and has named it Apetlac. It is late Tzacualli in date and possesses transitional qualities that definitely link it with the succeeding Classic phase. One of the early major results of Millon's survey was the discovery that the size of the residential area of Teotihuacan during the Tzacualli phase was far greater than previously estimated. It is now apparent that, during the earliesit recognized phase in the Teotihuacain sequence at 'the site itself, Teotihuacan had al- ready reached a size of over 8 sq. km. By the end of the Tzacualli phase, Teotihuacan was already more than large enough to provide a base for the growth and expansion which occurred in the succeeding phases in the life of the city. Brainerd (1954: 19) estimates that, in order to build the Sun Pyramid, a minimal force olf 1800 men was necessary over a period of 20 years. He suggests a minimal population of nearly 10,000 con- tributed to its construction. The actual number may have been two, three, or more times this due to, low efficiency of work and, if other smaller projects were under way simultaneously, a cor- respondingly larger number of people must have been concerned. In view of the above data, one is inclined to accept the idea that there is substantial evidence for definite continuity between Tzacualli and the later phases of Teotihuacain. Tzacualli is an early phase of Teotihuacan and is not the re- mains of an earlier unrelated culture. The immediate problem, then, is to define the nature of the relatio,nships between Tzacualli and the later phases of the Preclassic in the Valley of Teotihuacan and to determine whether there is an earlier basis for the urban traits that appear in the Tzacualli phase. CUANALAN Recent data compiled by the Teottihuacain Valley Project under the direction of William T. Sanders have greatly clarified the situation. Fletcher (1962) has excavated and analyzed a large sample olf Late Preclassic pottery from Cuanalan (Fig. 1) near Teo,tihuacan. On the basis of the above analysis, Sanders (1963) cor- roborates Millon and Bennyhoff's earlier as- sumption (Millon 1960: 8) that Cuanalan itself is a regional variant of the last phase of Ticoman as defined by Vailliant at Ticoman in the west- ern part of the Valley of Mexico. The Cuanalan figurines also show many resemblances to the figurines of Chupicuaro, Guanajuatoi (Porter 1956). The site of Cuanalan, although undoubt- edly rural and lacking ceremonial architecture, was a nucleated community of substantial size (possibly 500 to 1000 population). The spatial relations furthermore demonstrate clearly that Tzacualli cannot be contemporary, since the Cuanalan site is no more than 15 km. from Teotihuacan. In addition, a series of sites with Cuanalan ceramics has been found only 2 or 3 km. from the urban zone. The term Cuanalan phase will be used here to denote the variant of Late Ticoman that occurs in the Teotihuacain Valley.

It was later learned that Millon and Bennyhoff in 1957 had also surveyed Cerro Tezoyuca and had expressed the feeling that the pottery from this site demonstrates links with the Chimalhuacain and Tzacualli phases, which presumably follow, and with the Late Ticoman complex from Cuanalan, which by all indica!tions precedes it (Millon 1961: 10-11). These suggested links are based on the similari- ties in ceramic forms and designs in these three periods. Siince the discovery of this site, several others with similar ceramics have also, been found. These collectively constituite the Tezo- yuca phase. CERAMIC COMPARISONS A brief comparison of Tezoyuca ceramics with Cuanalan phase material and the Tzacualli phase at Teotihuac'an reveals many of its tran, sitional traits. Typical of the Tezoyuca assem- blage is the hemispherical bowl (Fig. 2 a), an uncommon form at Cuanalan. The Tzacualli sample does have numerous rims of this form, but they differ in that the modal variant has a large flat base (Fig. 2 c), which is nearly as exten- sive as the basal-break bowl, and a very slight exterior convexity. It looks like an intermediate form between a hemispherical bowl and a flat- bottomed basal-break bowl. Flat-bottomed basal-break bowls are rare at Cuanalan (Fig. 2 d), more common (but not the major form) at Tezoyuca, and much more common in Tzacualli samples, where it may be the prototype of the later Classic forms (Fig. 2 f). Round-bottomed basal-break bowls (compos- ite silhouette bowl) show a nearly perfect gradu- al shift from Cuanalan to Tzacualli. The very high wall forms (6 cms. + ) are present only in the Cuanalan complex and the very low wall forms (2 cms. -) present aft Tezoyuca (Fig. 2 g) are absent at Cuanalan. By Tzacualli times, only the very low wall form remains (Fig. 2 i), and the vessel is without supports. Vessels with wall heights varying between 2 and 6 cm. occur both at Cuanalan and at Tezoyuca but are absent in the Tzacualli complex. However, the general form occurs in all three phases. Ollas from Cuanalan and Tezoyuca are very similar. Most olla rims in the Tezoyuca sample are simple variants of the direct flaring-rim form from Cuanalan (Fig. 2 j). One lip variant, the notched lip, is absent at Cuanalan, relatively rare at Tezoyuca, and common in Tzacualli samples. The wedge rim (Fig. 2 1), which is the dominant Tzacualli form, is, rare at Tezoyuca and absent at Cuanalan. Pedestal bases are common at Tezoyuca but missing from both the Tzacualli and Cuanalan samples. Support variations reflect the distinctiveness of the three units. In this case, Tezoyuca and Cuanalan are moire allied than Tezoyuca and Tzacualli, since supports do not occur in the latter. The Cuanalan and Tezoyuca phases share the trait of large, globular, single and mul- tibodied hollow supports. The anthropomorphic forms found at Cuanalan, however, are absent at Tezoyuca, and most of the supports at Tezo- yuca have white-on-red designs - a character- istic absent at Cuanalan. White-on-red designs are very rare in the Cuanalan phase and very common during the Tezoyuca and Tzacualli phases. In the last, opposed to the thick, "blobby" white so char- acteristic of Tezoyuca, there is a thinner, "feath- ery" white-on-red similar to that found on Aztec polychromes.</page><page sequence="5">WEST ] PRECLASSIC TO CLASSIC AT TEOTIHUACAN 197 Negative painting is common in both Tezo- yuca and Tzacualli ceramics but less so at Cuan- alan. In the former two phases the design is much more complex and is associated with two forms, hemispherical bowls and flat-bottomed basal-break bowls, which are rare at Cuanalan. Polychrome painting, including a combination of positive and negative painting, occurs in all three phases, but it varies in style in each and reaches a peak of frequency and skill of execu- tion during the Tzacualli phase. Red-on-buff designs crosscut all three periods and also link this general Late Preclassic period to Early Classic Teotihuacan. All Cuanalan red- on-buff and most of that of Tezoyuca consist of solid areas of red on a buff or tan background, red-banded rims, or red-on-buff combined with negative painting. However, a few sherds from Tezoyuca and most of the Tzacualli red-on-buff show a clear-cut resemblance to Classic San Martin red-on-buff with thin red bands on a yellow-brown or, more commonly, tan surface. Cuanalan and Tezoyuca are united by high frequencies of H4 figurines, which are absent in Tzacualli samples. There are no unifying figur- ine traits be,tween Tezoyuca and Tzacualli. Tezo- yuca and Cuanalan have high frequencies of ceramic earplugs, whereas these are missing in the Tzacualli assemblage. At this point one can be fairly certain that Tezoyuca ceramics show very strong ties with the earlier Cuanalan phase, and it is likely that the former was derived from the latter or a simi- lar Late Ticoman assemblage. The seemingly strong continuities that exist between Tezoyuca and Tzacualli suggest deriva- tion of the latter from the former. Hojwever, several differences between the two indicate the existence of additional ceramic factors involved in the formation of the Tzacualli tradition. Sev- eral of these factors may be Chimalhuacatn in nature. TEZOYUCA SETTLEMENT PATTERN Since a unique settlement pattern was utilized by the Tezoyuca populations, it is important here to discuss briefly the general trend of change in settlement patterns tha;t occurred from the Early Preclassic to the Terminal Preclassic, which is here under discussion. It is generally believed that slash-and-burn agriculture (tlacolol) was the major type of tillage during the Preclassic period (Wolf 1959: 58). A survey of Preclassic sites in ;the Teo,tihua- can Valley has revealed that sites of the Early and Middle Preclassic are o,n hillsides in inacces- sible areas, primarily on the southern side of the valley in the Patlachique Range. The paucity o,f flatland and alluvial soils in their vicinity seems to suggest a hillside slash-and-burn pattern for these phases. However, during the Late Pre- classic Cuanalan phase, there was a change in the ecological bias oif habitation. Most of the sites are still hamlets like those of the earlier period, but they are on the hilly flanks of the northern edge of the valley, and three large villages are on -the edge of or just within the alluvial plain - the scene of the main focus of agricultural activity for the Classic, Postclassic, and Modern periods. The physiographic posi- tion of such sites seems to indicate that a more intensive system olf alluvial-plain farming was evolving. In the succeeding Tezoyuca phase, some interesting and revolutionary changes in settlement pattern occurred. All the sites of this period are on low, isolated hills immediately adjacent to the piedmont of the alluvial plain and were easily defended (Fig. 1). Such sites are probably compact villages with ceremonial architecture in the form of small pyramid mounds, the earliest in the Teotihuacan Valley. The social atmosphere, as reflected by the settle- ment pattern, looks like a highly competitive one. An alternative interpretation of site patterns, in the light of the above evidence, is that there was a Maya-type settlement pattern. All sites have ceremonial structures and elaborate ce- ramic styles. The excavation at Tezoyuca un- covered a large platform with an accompanying patio that was probably the residence of an important personage. It is possible that these were ceremonial centers that served small popu- lations on the alluvial plain. However, as no remains of Tezoyuca occupation have been dis- covered in any other locale, it is doubtful if a Maya pattern existed. Furthermore, the deposits of ceramics on the sites suggest small nucleated communities. CHIMALHUACAN CERAMICS AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS A remaining problem is the relationships of Noguera's Chimalhuacan complex, as derived from excavations at a site outside the focus of the Teotihuacan Valley, to the Tezoyuca and Tzacualli complexes.</page><page sequence="6">198 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY L VOL. 31, No. 2, 1965 The discovery of many Chimalhuacan sites in the Teo,tihuacan Valley during the 1963 field season necessitated the choice of a lo!cal phase name for the culture. William T. Sanders, Rene Millo,n, James Bennyhoff, and Florencia Muller met in a series of seminars to, establish a basic ceramic itypology and chronology for the Valley of Teotihuacan. The name "Patlachique" was chosen to deno,te the Chimalhuacan culture as it occurs in the Teotihuacan Valley. Hereafter in this paper Patlachique will refer to a par- ticular local development as opposed to the general Chimalhuacan culture outside the Teo- tihuacan Valley (Fig. 3). At first, the ceramic relationships between Tezoyuca and Paitlachique were not very clear. However, a series of small stratigraphic pits at Noguera's Chimalhuac'an site of El Tepalcate and intensive survey in the Teotihuacain Valley have disclosed new information that may aid in the invesitigation o'f the above problem. The stratigraphic pits at El Tepalcate indicate two general periods of occupation. The earliest resembles Tezoyuca in many respects. Among them are variants of Late Ticoman olla rims, hemispherical bowls, high- and medium-walled basal-break bowls, flat-bo,ttomed basal-break bowls, and pedestal bases. H4 variant figurines and several fragments olf earplugs are present in this assemblage. Definition of the type of design and decoration is made difficult by the fact that the entire sample of early material is dark in color, possibly due to some action of the saline soil. Several sherds with characteristic Tezoyuca designs in white on the above-mentioned dark surface may actually be white-on-red. The sam- ple is significantly different, however, in olther respects, but it app,arently stems from the Late Ticoman tradition and is probably related to and in part contemporary with Tezoyuca (Fig. 3). The later ceramics were not affected insofar as surface color is concerned. This assemblage does not show as close a relationship to Tezo- yuca as do the earlier ceramics, but it retains generalized form characteristics from the latter complex. The changes that occur in the general forms from the earlier period, and which more closely resemble Tzacualli, are a high frequency of wedge-rim ollas (Fig. 2 k), low-walled basal- break bowls with round bottoms (Fig. 2 h), flat- boittomed basal-break bowls (Fig. 2 e), and hem- ispherical bowls (Fig. 2 b). Notched-rim ollas carry over into Tzacualli but are of a different style and are more closely related to forms pres- ent at Tezo,yuca. Red-on-buff is the dominant type of surface decoration. The Chimalhuacain assemblage possesses sev- eral unique new figurine traits that were first alluded to as being Tezoyuca because they ap- peared first in the Tezoyuca excavation. Their occurrence a,t Tezo,yuca is explained by the large overlapping Patlachique occupation, which may also explain the presence of wedge-and-notched- rim ollas in the Tezoyuca assemblage. The new figurine traits include Tezoyuca Polished Red, Types A, B, and C (based on the terminology first used to describe them in the Tezoyuca re- port; West 1963). In the Teoltihuacan Valley, survey work has revealed several important features that per- tain to the Patlachique occupation. Paramount is a large village on Cerro Colorado, a hill di- rectly adjacent to the presently defined archaeo- logical zone of Teotihuacan. This site adjoins the Tzacualli occupation thait has been delimited by Millon and Bennyhoff and is above the springs which serve the present-day irrigation system in the valley. Another large village was discovered on the alluvial plain between Cuana- lan and Cerro Tezoyuca and, in fact, extends over the flank of the hill and covers the Tezo- yuca site. Patlachique occupations are found covering all the Tezoyuca sites and as small ham- lets scattered olver the piedmont of the south side of the valley, but there is a tendency to cluster aroiund the central village or town in the middle of the valley. A large village site has been preliminarily excavated at Temesco, a very short distance from El Tepalcate (Dixon 1963). The ceramics are contemporary with materials from the mid- dle and upper levels of El Tepalcate, and the depth of the deposit suggeslts a short span of olccupa,tion. This site has several large pyramid structures; it has an extensive zone of habitation and was apparently a center serving a large area. CUICUILCO IV Recent work by Bennyhoff and others at Cui- cuilco in the southern Valley of Mexico has established a final phase of Ticoman develop- ment that was not noted by Vaillant in his stud- ies there (Bennyhoff, personal communication). This phase has been designated Cuicuilco IV and occurs later in time than the Cuanalan phase, which is contemporary with Cuicuilco III (Vaillant's Late Ticoman). According to, Benny- hoff, Cuicuilco IV developed out of Cuicuilco III</page><page sequence="7">WEST ] PRECLASSIC TO CLASSIC AT TEOTIHUACAN 199 and is represented by negative painting and white-on-red design styles. Characteristic also are pedestal bases, Cuanalan olla rims, high- and medium-walled basal-break bowls with round bottoms, H4 figurines, large multibodied supports, and hemispherical bowls. Similar ma- terial exists at Tlapacoya in the southeastern Valley of Mexico. This was ascertained by analy- sis of a large surface sample from the site and by comparison with illusitrations in "Tlapacoya" Un Sitio Preclassico de Transicion (Barba de Pifia Chan 1956) with ceramics from Tezoyuca. This author placels Tezoyuca and Early Chimalhua- can on the same time horizon as Cuicuilco IV, but as regional variants having the,ir foci in the southern Texcoco Plain and Teoltihuacan Valley (Fig. 3). This chronological placement would explain the persistence of several sitandard Late Ticoman and Cuicuilco IV traits, such as H4 figurines, earplugs, and high- and medium- walled, round-bottomed ba,sal-break bowls, as well as the development of white-on-red decora- tioin and negative painting. Their classification as regional variants allows for independent ac- tion along certain lines, in this case variations in olla rims and in design styles and the develop- ment of new forms, such as the low-walled basal- break bowl with round bottom. Also important is the presence of ceremonial architecture at Tezoyuca, a characteristic of the well-developed culture at Cuicuilco to the south. Chimalhuacan pottery has been found in the fill olf structures at Cuicuilco and occurs in quantities large enough perhaps to, warrant a Chimalhuacain occupation (Bennyhoff, personal communication). It is quite possible that Chi- malhuac'an is the product of local evoluition at Cuicuilco, growing out of Cuicuilco IV and rep- resenting the final phase of habitation before the eruption of the volcano Xitli. Even though Tezoyuca and Early Chimal- huacan at El Tepalcate share the same Cui- cuilco IV tradition, the much closer proximity of El Tepalcate to Cuicuilco may have stimulated a faster change in the ceramic styles of the former from Early Chimalhuacan to Chimal- huacan. The Tezoyuca populations further north, being more isolated, continued in the older Cuicuilco IV tradition. Surface collections and materials from the uppermost levels at El Tepalcate show very small quantities of typical Tezoyuca ceramics, mosit likely as trade items. The latter indicates that there was culture con, of Mexico Plain Teotlnuacan TZACUALLI (TEO. I) 0 A.D. PATLACHI ITU E\\ Tezoy-uca CHIMALHUACAN PATLACHIQUE assimilation 150 B.C. ?

RECONSTRUCTION OF CULTURE HISTORY A theoretical reconstruction of the culture his- tory of the Terminal Preclassic and the origin of the urban city of Teotihuacain will be presented below, utilizing the data and evidence that have been presented in this paper. The existence of similar phases of cultural development at Cuicuilco, Early Chimalhuac'an, and in the Valley of Teotihuacan illustrates the general homogeneity of culture in the Valley of Mexico during the Late and Terminal Preclassic. But during this period the Valley of Teo,tihua- can was clearly a marginal area with respect to the Valley of Mexico as a whole. The popu- lation was light. Ceremonial architecture and presumably the entire hieratic complex that was the primary vehicle of Mesoamerican civilization in the earlier phase of its growth were developed much earlier in the southern Valley of Mexico, as evidenced by the sites of Tlatilco and Cui- cuilco. T-his is understandable, since the better- watered southern valley would be much more favorable for settlement. Disrupting factors developed as climatic vari- ables began to affect the existing populations. A striking result of the Teotihuacan Valley Project was the discovery of climatic stability through- out the entire span of time represented by human occupation (Sanders 1964: 12). How- ever, there are indications of minor cycling of wet and dry periods, but there is no evidence for the long-range cycles postulated by Sears (1951). Evidence of minor climatic fluctuations was dis- covered at El Tepalcate. This site is on the lake bed, indicating that the lake at this time</page><page sequence="8">200 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY I VOL. 31, No. 2, 1965 had been reduced by a period of decline in rain- fall. One trench profile clearly showed alternat- ing layers of sand and pottery, suggesting inter- mittent periods of rainfall and flooding of the site from time to time. In addition, near Venta de Carpio, on the northern edge of the lake, there is evidence of continual occupation on and near the lake bed from the Middle Preclassic through the Classic and again during the Aztec period. In the Teotihuacan Valley the distribution of the Cuanalan phase village sites o,n or near the alluvial plain and around the springs may be cultural responses, in the form of new agricul- tural practices, to cycles of aridity and loss of hillside land resulting from erosion. This general settlement pattern was continued in the follow- ing Tezoyuca phase, although with modifica- tions, and alluvial-plain cultivation became the principal form of agriculture. Irrigation on a very simple level may have been instituted dur- ing this period or earlier. Recent analysis of pollen samples from cores taken near the springs suggests that swamps which had formed were drained during the Preclassic period. The har- nessing of drainage water to floodland may have constituted the beginning of the practice of irri- gation in the Teotihuacan Valley. Palerm (1961: 299-300) reports tracing po,s- sible irrigation canals, that disappear under the lava flow at Cuicuilco,. Although there is no conclusive proof that these canals served this purpose, the presence of irrigation at Cuicuilco is understandable when account is taken of the large population, centralized authority, and availability of water that presumably existed there. It may be noted that during the Cuanalan and Tezoyuca phases in the Teotihuacan Valley there is no evidence of population pressure, and therefore i;t is doubtful whether this factor was operative in the shifting of farming activity, as it may have been at the large site of Cuicuilco'. One of the significant events in the culture history of the Valley of Mexico, was the eruption of the volcano Xitli, whose lava flow covered Cuicuilco and displaced the resident and sur- rounding populations to other areas of the Val- ley of Mexico. The presence of Chimalhuacian pottery at Cuicuilco suggests that it was the final phase of occupation before the eruption. The significance of this event and this impact on the history of the Valley of Teotihuacan is reflected in the subsequent population expansion. The defensive positions of the Tezoyuca sites, if they may be so interpreted, is an indica- tion of the conflict that possibly occurred when the displaced Chimalhuac'an peoples moved into the valley. This is suggested by four impor- tant features that appear in the Tezoyuca exca- vation: (1) a high frequency of small projectile points as opposed to a low frequency in the pre- ceding Cuanalan phase; (2) large quantities of fired-clay fragments which appear to, be the remains o,f a wattle-and-daub structure that had been burned; (3) the stairway of the platform was apparently intentionally destroyed; and (4) the o,verlying Patlachique pottery o-ccurs only in the uppermost levels. If the implied conflict did actually occur, the result was the subjugation and absorption of the Tezoyuca culture. Patlachique sites are fo,und all over the valley. However, nearly all are sitill small hamlets on hilly flanks at bo,th sides of the valley. One large village is on the alluvial plain between Cerro Tezoyuca and Cuanalan in the lower part of the valley. The most important Patlachique site is a huge village sprawling over some 50 hectares near the northwestern border of the Classic city and in an excellent position to domi- nate use of the springs. These people may have brought with them the knowledge of irrigation or inherited it fro,m the previous population that had been experimenting with it, and con- trol of the above water source would have per- mitted them to maintain such a system. The results of such a functional relationship based on irrigation are well documented in the history of the early civilizations. At Teo,tihuacan it may have provided an expanding base for the urban economy which became evident in the Tzacualli and the following Classic phases. During the Tzacualli phase, a real population explosion occurred in the Teotihuacan Valley. The Patlachique village grew into a very large village that covered some 700 hectares and had a boundary that partly coincided with that of the later Classic city but extended to the no,rth- west well beyond its borders. The emergence of the Tzacualli ceramic tra- dition may be viewed as the result of the fusion of Patlachique traditions with the assimilated Tezoyuca culture. A comparison of the ceramics from the three phases strongly suggests this. It was pointed out earlier that many of the diag- nostic Tzacualli ceramic forms are seemingly derived from Tezoyuca and that several impor- tant Tzacualli traits, such as notched- and wedge,</page><page sequence="9">WEST ] PRECLASSIC TO CLASSIC AT TEOTIHUACAN 201 rimmed ollas and form variations in low-walled basal-break bowls with roiund bolttoms and flat- bottomed basal-break bowls are closely allied to Patlachique characteristics. The profusion of decora,ted types that occur in Tzacualli suggests derivation from Tezoyuca ceramic art styles. This is reinforced by the unusually low fre- quency of decorated types in the Patlachique assemblage. In general, the characteristics that comprise the Tzacualli ceramic tradition were equally drawn from Patlachique forms and Tezo- yuca styles. The culture pattern that evolved at Teotihuacarn may be visualized as the product of interactioon with enviro,nmental conditions, the introduction of a new culture complex that possibly carried specialized adap,tations, and cul- tural processes that went into effect when the new complex interacted with the old. In a sense then, the earlier interpretation -that one or more migrations were responsible for the urban traits at Teo,tihulacarn is true. But the lack of more substantial and precise data led the interpreters to err in their basic assumptions. The Chimalhuacarn migration to- the Teo,tihua- can Valley was one of the main local movemernits that repeatedly oiccurred in the Valley of Mex- ico. These local movements in that small area were one of the dynamic processes in the evolu- tion of Prehispanic culture. Acknowledgments.
