The issue of a Highgod or All-Father in "primitive religion" sparked one of the classical debates in anthropology, involving strongly partisan views from orthodox evolutionism on the one hand and Highgod proponents, above all Fr. Wilhelm Schmidt, on the other. The author of this paper argues that the All-Father concept is not an indigenous belief form, but is essentially of Christian provenance skillfully adapted to an Aboriginal cognitive background. The religious concept is interpreted as a politically active form of symbolism related to questions of power and socio-political interests in Aboriginal society at the time.

References Cited). The question whether some Australian Aboriginal groups traditionally possessed a monotheistic form of belief prior to the advent of Christianity, has aroused anthropological and theological minds, in- termittently, for some decades. In this paper I am going to re-examine the so-called All-Father figure in the Aboriginal pantheon. My discussion will focus chiefly on the following major aspects: first, I shall re-appraise the ethnographic record and outline the debate pro and contra the authenticity of this concept; then I shall evaluate the merits of the case and argue for the non-authenticity of this belief, and provide evidence by adducing, briefly, cases from other parts of the world which seem comparable to me insofar as they show, upon analysis, the influcence of Christianity; then I shall try to underpin my point by drawing on a theory of religious symbolism, and lastly I shall outline a "sociology of knowledge" in traditional Aboriginal society. 1. Introduction In the 19th century, ethnographers working main- ly in south-east Australia, recorded a widespread belief among Aborigines in a supreme male deity who seemed to surpass others in importance and exaltedness. Aborigines knew of him by various names, such as Baiarne, Nurrundere, Nurelli, Mar- tumnere, Biamban, Bunjil, Daramulun, Mami-nga- ta, Mungan-ngaua, and countless others many of which mean "father," or "our father," or simply "elder." In the anthropological literature, subse- quently, this deity was referred to as All-Father, Sky God, High-God (Hochgott), Supreme Spirit, and Supreme Being and surrounded by such an ethnographic aura as to invest it with qualities of (almost) monotheistic proportions. Aborigines seem to have believed this divine character to dwell in the sky and to be, though somewhat otiose, of a benign disposition towards humanity. Basic creative deeds, of both a natural and cul- tural kind, were attributed to him, such as having shaped basic features of the earth, having instituted initiation ceremonies and life-giving rituals, laid down laws and customs, and the like. On a more abstract level of exegesis, one might say that he represented the principle of good, having combat- ted and triumphed over evil in some form or other. Having retreated from his sojourn on earth, he was believed now to live in the sky, aloof aloft, and, according to some beliefs, sitting on a throne. The Narrinyeri, for instance, spoke of a Su- preme Being whom they called Nurrundere and Martumnere. He was credited with having created all things on earth, having given men weapons, and having instituted all rituals which the Ab- origines practised. "On inquiring why they adhere to any custom, the reply is, because Nurundere commanded it" (Taplin 1878: 55). Similarly the Wiimbaio talked of Nurelli with great reverence. He was supposed to have made the land, rivers, trees, and animals and to have given the Aborig- ines their laws before ascending to the sky where</page><page sequence="2">10 Erich Kolig he can now be seen as a celestial constellation (Howitt 1904: 489). In south-west Victoria Nurelli is replaced by a being known as Pirnmeheeal: a good spirit who, in the form of a gigantic man, lives above the clouds and who, though of kindly disposition towards humanity, does not play a great part in worldly affairs, and is seldom spoken of (489). Further examples include the belief in Baiarne among the Kamilaroi. He is said to have created all things and to live now in the sky as a bearded old man. Those tribes which attended the Yuin Kuringal ceremonies professed a belief in a spirit called Daramulun, also known by the name of Biamban or Papang (meaning master and father respectively). He was said to have dwelt on earth when it was still barren and there were no men, only animals and birds. After creating the human ancestors, he gave them their laws and customs, told them how to live, and made the bull-roarer whose sound is said to represent his voice. He then ascended to the sky where he watches over everything, punishing those who breach his ordi- nances (Howitt 1884a: 192). When someone dies, Daramulun meets his spirit and cares for it (188). The Wotjobaluk, the Mukjarawaint, the Kulin, the Wurunjerri, and the Kurnai had a deity Bunjil or Mungan-ngaua which translates as "our father" or "father of all of us" (Howitt 1904: 489 ff.). While there is some variation in the conceptual- ization of this deity, on the whole he is seen as a great, old man who had once lived on earth, performed deeds of creation, and then ascended to the sky. According to Kurnai belief, before he did so, he unleashed a cataclysm involving a great deluge when the esoteric secrets of the Jeraeil were revealed to women (Howitt 1904: 493). Howitt correctly surmised that these various deities are in fact manifestations of only one divinity, and, indeed, the overall similarity among all of them seems to warrant this assumption. Almost all relevant ethnographic information was gathered by amateur anthropologists, many of them missionaries. I consider this very signif- icant in view of what shall later be said about Aboriginal suggestibility. Apparently as early as the 1850s, among others, George Taplin (1873 [1878]) had gathered data on a Supreme Being belief among south-eastern Aboriginal groups. But the principal recorder of this information, who managed to make a considerable impression on the prevalent anthropological tenet of his time, was A. W. Howitt (1830-1908). However, it seems that the available information on the subject was more than a little ambiguous as he wavered in the inter- pretation and it seemed to take him some time to make up his mind. In his earliest publication: "Ka- milaroi and Kurnai" (with L. Fison, 1880 [1967]), he does not speak of a Supreme Being. He re- fers repeatedly to missionary activity and presents much of the relevant information in the context of mission influence (1967: 186, 254). Here he appears to incline to the view that the belief in what subsequently came to be seen as a Supreme Being or Sky Being is the result of Christian in- fluence. "We have here an Aboriginal belief mod- ified by contact with the whites" (210). He curtly dismisses some Aboriginal beliefs as inauthentic as the informant may have been influenced by Christianity (247). In his later papers on the subject (1884ö, 1884ft, and 1885) he is more forthright, now apparently taking the word of his informants that there were no Christian influences at the root of the divine concept in question. (Surely one must wonder at his sudden gullibility accepting now such information at face value, uncritically, and without apparently making an attempt to verify it in any form. Even if the informants have spoken in good faith and without intention of misleading, they might have been wrong.) Even so, Howitt appears still to have been somewhat reluctant as to whether one can speak of a religion proper in Aboriginal culture (1884a: 198). But later on (1884ft: 459) he is more confident asserting that Aborigines do have religion in the sense of "beliefs which govern tribal and individual morality under a supernatural sanction." But he still seems some- what hesitant to put forward his information on a "Supreme Spirit." In this uncertainty he probably just mirrors the general scientific sentiments of his day, which denied Australian Aborigines the intellectual development thought necessary to hold any kind of religious conceptions. Howitt may simply have been reticent to challenge head-on this anthropological doctrine of his day. Where Aboriginal beliefs were known at all, they were usually and derisively labelled "superstitions" (see, for instance, Palmer 1884). In any case, in his book "The Native Tribes of South-East Australia" (1904) Howitt seems not only to have overcome his earlier doubts but also to have now convinced himself of the genuine antiquity and authenticity of the All-Father concept. Of equal interest are the two papers by Ho- witt's contemporary R. H. Mathews (1841-1918), a surveyor who had collected information from Europeans and, to some extent, from Aborigines in the early 1890s on a Bora ritual held in 1893 which he, however, had not witnessed himself, and on the Burbung ritual (1895-1896). Whether or not he was influenced by Howitt in the interpretation Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="3">Religious Power and the All -Father in the Sky 1 1 of his second-hand material and therefore inclined to see an All-Father where otherwise there might have been none, remains unclear. Not much later Mrs. Langloh Parker offered similar observations and interpretations in her book on the Euahlayi (1905). R. Brough Smyth supplied a brief laconic statement on the Supreme Being Baiarne among Aboriginal groups in the north-west and west of New South Wales and on Pundjel or Bunjil among neighbouring groups (1876/1: 423, 424, 428; II: 285). However, recordings of a supreme male deity in Aboriginal religion were not con- fined to the south-east. The centre and western parts seemed to offer similar data. Another early recorder of such a belief was the Spanish bishop Dom Rudesindo Salvado, founder of New Norcia mission north of Perth. "The natives from round about New Norcia do not adore any divinity, true or false. However, they have an idea of an all-pow- erful being, creator of earth and sky, whom they call 'Motogon.' They think of this Motogon as a very strong man, tall, wise, of the same colour and the same country as themselves; and they say that when he created the kangaroo, the sun, the trees, etc., he used these words: 'Land, come forth!' (and he blew, and the land was created); 'water, come forth!' (and he blew, and the water was created) - and so on for the other things. This account greatly resembles the words of Sacred Scripture, 'Let there be light, and light was made'; and by adding the words 'blew,' it makes us realize that there is extant among them the tradition expressed in the Book of Genesis, though the word is used there only of the creation of man." Here, I think, Salva- do, by drawing this parallel between Christianity and a supposedly indigenous Aboriginal belief puts his finger precisely on the problem. He continues: "They also have the idea of an evil spirit who is superior to them, whom they greatly fear, and whom they call 'Cienga'" (Salvado 1977 [1851]: 126). In central Australia the Lutheran missionary Carl Strehlow (1907: If. and 1908: 1) recorded a supreme, good deity Altjira in the pantheon of the Aranda, and his equivalent Tukura among the Loritja. This god was said to be a great, strong anthropomorphic being with long, yellow hair and red skin who somewhat incongruously is possessed of emu feet (see also von Leonhardi 1907). He is not credited with the creation of human beings and is remote to their existence. The Aranda have neither love nor fear for him. (Altjira means "not-created" and is a name which probably refers to all Dreamtime beings.) Altjira Anthropos 87.1992 is said to be surrounded by beautiful young men and maidens, while the Loritja said that he has a wife and a child who never grows up - appar- ently a close resemblance to the Biblical motive of the Holy Family. The southern neighbours of the Aranda, the Dieri, are also on record, due to the efforts of the missionary Reuther, to have a belief in a "good spirit creator" Mura Mura who is spoken of with great reverence and who has created humans, instituted marriage laws and the totemic order (von Leonhardi 1907: 287; but von Leonhardi goes quickly on to disprove this belief as an error of recording by Reuther; see also von Leonhardi 1909). The famous ethnographer duo Spencer and Gil- len offered similar findings from among the cen- tral Australian Aranda (Arunta in their spelling). They refer to a supreme deity in superlative form as a "very special of the mythical Alchera Be- ings," "the great outstanding central figure," and the "supreme ancestor overshadowing all others." This deity who allegedly is called Inkata Alchera Numbkalla by the Aranda, had no special totem, but had made and "owned" them all, the creator of many topographical features of the land, totems, animals, plants, and churingas (Spencer and Gillen 1927/1: 355 f.). In 1904 (498 ff.), Spencer and Gil- len had recorded a faintly similar figure, the sky god Atnatu. Even in the far north of Western Australia, sim- ilar beliefs seem to have been found. In the 1930s, Andreas Lommel thought he noticed a belief in a creative divinity of exalted status among the Wunambal (1952: 10). This divinity, Walangan, was said to have created the sky, fresh water, animals, and plants. However, the impact of his findings is somewhat diminished through Petri's who worked at the same time among the Nga- rinyin, a neighbouring and closely related group among whom Walangan was only attributed with a very limited creation not unlike other Wandjinas (Petri 1954: 111 ff.) 2. The Debate The information on a supposedly supreme deity in Aboriginal belief sparked off a lively, at times impassioned debate, which exceeded a reasoned, detached consideration concerning the ethnograph- ic authenticity of the reports and of the anthro- pological ramifications resulting from them. Ob- viously, it was not merely considered a matter of whether there was or was not missionary influence responsible for the existence of a High God con-</page><page sequence="4">12 Erich Kolig cept among Aboriginal tribes. Much more was at stake. The affair had escalated to one of ideolog- ical partisanship and anthropological dogmatism, as two opposing world views collided forcefully with each other. On the one hand, there was the orthodoxy of evolutionist thinking which, holding Aborigines as the most primitive people on earth and as representative of the early beginnings of social and cultural evolution, saw them as quite incapable of forming a theological concept of a supreme deity. Such a concept being not too far removed from Christian monotheism, was con- sidered theologically rather too sophisticated to fit the primitiveness of both culture and mind of such people. As Sir James Frazer (1960: 72) was to express this notion: "Among the aborig- ines of Australia, the rudest savages as to whom we possess accurate information, magic is uni- versally practised, whereas religion in the sense of a propitiation or reconciliation of the higher powers seems to be nearly unknown." Worship of a supreme deity clearly did not fit into this preconception which dominated anthropological thinking for several decades. Not even the work of Spencer and Gillen, Howitt, and Carl Strehlow succeeded in making obvious the fallacy of this doctrine and to convince the scientific world at large of the existence of an intricate religious life in Aboriginal society. It was to be left to Durkheim to change anthropological thinking profoundly. In his "Les formes élémentaires" (1912) he treated Aboriginal religion as a serious matter, worthy of intensive investigation. (However, his treatise had the unfortunate result of biasing anthropology in another way, namely in now perceiving religion as an epiphenomenon of society.) Sydney Hartland spoke of the "antecedent im- probability" that naked savages, who have no or- ganized government and are incapable of counting to seven, should have such an exalted philosoph- ical concept, i.e., a moral, eternal, and omniscient creator figure and judge (1898: 290-329). Arnold van Gennep was similarly unconvinced by the eth- nographic records and simply judged the concept to be an exaggeration (by whom?) of an ancestral figure (cited in Schmidt [1912] 1926: 319ff.) While the evolutionary perspective could not reconcile itself with the view that Aborigines could possibly have evolved a religious belief intellectu- ally of such disconcerting similarity to Christianity and assumed that, if the ethnographic information was correct, it could only have originated through mission influence, opponents of this view seem to have accepted the ethnographic information at its face value. Some may simply have been more open-minded wishing to let the evidence, or what they took as such, speak for itself, despite the heavy dominance of the evolutionary paradigm in anthropology of that time. Howitt, however, prob- ably because of his awareness of the fact that his work, if it were to gain respectability in anthropo- logical circles, could not openly contradict evolu- tionism, tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to bring about a reconciliation of his concept of a Supreme Being with the prevalent notion of the Aborigines' primi- tiveness. His attempt to account for the presence of such a "sophisticated" religious concept by linking it with the "more advanced" social structure of the Aborigines in the south-east (1904: 500, 506), does not sound convincing today. It does not sit well with the discovery of similar beliefs in central Australia and other parts whose Aboriginal groups could not be seen as "more advanced"; nor is the idea of "more advanced" social structures vis-à-vis those supposedly less so considered of much merit nowadays. Besides Aborigines in the south-east do not to a significant extent differ in their social arrangements from groups elsewhere who do not espouse the All-Father belief. However, at the time, this notion was seriously entertained. There are indications that Taplin (1878: 120) already maintained that the High God belief is the remnant of a higher state of culture possessed once by the relevant tribes. Similarly Howitt (1904: 500 and 506), perhaps inspired by Taplin, sees this reli- gious concept represented by those groups who at least in traces have greater social advancement in terms of having developed a chiefly system, who have progressed from group marriage to individual marriage, from matriliny to patriliny, and from a "class system" (?) to "locality" (of descent?). For whatever reason then, Howitt, Mathews, Parker, and others accepted the authenticity and antiquity of the concept with an amazing lack of scepticism, despite their awareness of ethno- graphic features which should have raised more than just fleeting doubts. However, such doubts, if they arose at all, were dismissed by them some- times with what can only be called astonishing carelessness. N. W. Thomas, in a rather confused paper (1905), mentions that several missions had been established in south-east Australia from very early on, but then goes on in what seems a wild non-sequitur, to insist that Baiarne was certain- ly not of mission origin, as though he had just established this beyond a shadow of doubt (52). Similarly in his book "Natives of Australia" (1906) he denies any possible Christian influence (216), though conceding (217) that in one case at least missionary influence is undeniable; but hints that Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="5">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 1 3 this influence may have crept in through the bias of the ethnographer, a Mr. Manning. Later of course there were some, Andrew Lang and most notably Father W. Schmidt, who tried to reverse the orthodox evolutionary scheme, by positing a highly developed religious system at the beginning of cultural evolution. Seeing, as other evolutionists did, Aborigines as representatives of an early phase of human development, they as- cribed to them now what they considered to be the earliest religious ideas, namely an "Urmono- theismus." Thus one side of the evolutionary coin emphatically denied Aborigines the capability of any form of religious thought, let alone a more advanced theological concept, while the other - or some extreme proponents at least - insisted that they were the bearers of its highest form: monothe- ism. Thus, interestingly, evolutionism, with regard to the Aborigines, espoused the notion of both the Noble and the Ignoble Savage at the same time. While the idea of an "Uroffenbarung," which had been preserved by ancient hunter/gatherer societ- ies, portrayed them as the Noble Savages par ex- cellence, the opposing evolutionary view, holding with the idea of the Aborigines' unmitigated prim- itiveness and simplemindedness, placed them in the proximity of the image of the Ignoble Savage bereft of reason and high culture. E. M. Curr, a staunch proponent of unilineal evolutionism, eloquently decried the notion that Aborigines were capable of religious thought in his monumental four volume work, "The Australian Race" (1886-87). He thought them quite incapable of any thought of god or of worship of the divine. It is obvious from his writing that he had so narrow and bigoted a concept of religion as to be totally blinkered to a more reasoned interpretation of the ethnographic data of which he was abundantly aware and which should have alerted him to the fact that Aborigines engaged in elaborate rituals involving notions of divinities. Instead he deni- grated the undeniable evidence of ritual worship as mere corroborées, dramatic representations of episodes of the tribal life and history, and, at best, credited Aborigines with a belief in spirits (1886/1: 44, 90, 158). Reports by missionaries and others about monotheistic beliefs among Aborigines of which he was well aware, he dismissed out of hand (44 f.). Questioning the reports' validity, he accuses the missionaries of having been duped by the Aborigines who invented these stories simply to please (45). Doctrinaire as Curr's views are otherwise, he may have a point in this regard. Anyone who has worked with Aborigines will testify to the fact that unwritten cultural courtesies Anthropos 87.1992 compeli Aborigines to be extremely "cooperative" and tell the enquirer exactly what they think he wants to hear. Whether Curr had this in mind, and indeed was aware of it, or simply was being doctrinaire, is impossible to tell. C. Strehlow made this point rather unflatteringly with the following words (von Leonhardi 1907: 286): "as you know, the Australian blacks are in general great liars; that means to check and check again. Towards the White and especially the missionary the Blacks want to show themselves in a good light and give their legends a Christian tinge. . . ." He continues: . . . "one must never develop one's own opinion vis-à-vis a Black and then ask: is that so? This question will more often than not be answered in the affirmative . . ." (my translation). If Strehlow himself, however, has heeded his own warning with regard to his information on a High God among the Aranda and Loritja remains doubtful. The giant of evolutionary thinking in anthro- pology at the time, E. B. Tylor, entered the de- bate by defending the notion that all peoples had some form of religious belief, ergo also Australian Aborigines (1873: 457). This today must certain- ly be seen as a step in the right direction. But placing them in the phase of his Natural Religion or animistic spirit belief phase, Tylor held the Aborigines to be too simpleminded to be capable of so advanced a theological form as a belief in a supreme deity. The suggestion that such primitive people should have a quasi monotheistic concep- tion, which in his mind was representative of a much higher stage of intellectual development, seemed quite preposterous to him (1892: 290 ff.). If its presence in this culture could indeed be con- firmed, he argued, and was not simply an error of recording, it could only point to one thing, namely missionary influence. "If then Baiarne, unknown to well-informed observers till about 1840, suddenly appears then with markedly Biblical characteris- tics, the natural inference is that he arose from the teaching of the missionaries" (1892: 294). He cites as further evidence that this belief occurs in a region in which missionary activity had been most intense, namely the south-east of Australia (295). Orthodox evolutionary thinking persisted well into this century, as is apparent in particular in Sigmund Freud's work. In his "Totem und Ta- bu" (1913) he perpetuated notions, at that time already somewhat outdated, that Aborigines were the "most retarded and pitiful savages" (1956: 9) and held forth with his view that "it is doubtful if one can attribute to them even traces of re- ligion" (10). The amazing persistence of views of an earlier anthropological period was possible</page><page sequence="6">14 Erich Kolig through a heavy reliance on antiquated sources such as James Frazer's (Totemism and Exogamy; 1910), Andrew Lang's, and MacLennan's religious schemes, and by ignoring the much more detailed ethnographies of Spencer and Gillen, Roth, and others. Despite drawing on some Australian eth- nographies, Freud does not refer to the All-Father belief, presumably as this would have required him to reconcile it with his dogmatic statements about the extraordinary "primitiveness" of the Aborig- ines. Yet, as we shall see later, in his "Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion" (1939), he implicitly pointed towards a valid interpretation of the All-Father concept in south-east Australia. Hegel had argued that no primeval people had been enlightened by god, could have been en- dowed with revealed insight and perfect wisdom, or were in the possession of knowledge of a spiritual truth. Such a notion would clearly have antagonized his cosmological scheme of a spiritual principle "Geist," gaining self-consciousness or awareness of itself through a process of dialec- tical development in which reason plays a major role as propelling force towards attainment of the "Absolute." Placing recognition of the truth - in whatever form: spiritual or intellectual - at the beginning of the evolutionary process would have been antithetical to the thrust of his argument. Hegel's scheme and with it the orthodox evo- lutionism of Tylor, Curr, and others were turned on their heads by Father Wilhelm Schmidt who wished to support his contention of an "Urof- fenbarung" by which God was supposed to have revealed himself to humanity. In a belated attempt to reverse Teilhard de Chardin 's synthetization of evolutionary science and Catholicism, Schmidt was keen on finding evidence of monotheistic traits in all societies, but especially those of ex- traordinary "primitiveness" which, on the basis of evolutionary notions akin to those he wished to refute, he thought had preserved features of early mankind. Earlier of course Andrew Lang and Max Müller had propounded schemes in which ab- stract and higher religious forms precede fetishism and other forms which represent degradations (see Morris 1987: 93). The implication of Schmidt's contention, if taken literally, is that the All-Father belief is the oldest religious form in existence, and, leaving aside the speculative history of religions, there should be some corroborative evidence through archaeological findings which at least tentative- ly underpin the ancientness of beliefs one may reasonably consider associated with the relevant material manifestations. Careful analysis of the rockpaintings in the Kakadu National Park in the northernmost part of Australia has revealed the presence of extinct animals and a change in the subjects depicted after about 7000 to 9000 years ago when the sea rose to its present level. The well known religious image of the Rainbow Serpent (cf. Buchler and Maddock 1978) begins to appear in the rock art of that time. Perhaps the postglacial swallowing up of vast tracts of coastal land by the advancing sea may have given rise to this divine character which is nearly always associated with floods and rain- storms. At any rate, the appearance of the Rainbow Serpent as a distinct motive in the rock art of that period makes it the longest continuing religious belief documented for Australia, and perhaps for the whole world.1 Archaelogical evidence of burials, grave offer- ings, and cave art testify to the existence - or more cautiously phrased, the probability of the existence - in Australia of some forms of religious beliefs for some considerable time. However, the evidence unearthed so far does not lend itself to the inference of more concrete conclusions. All that can be gathered from the galleries of rock art depicting animals and sometimes plants is that to- temic forms of belief and worship probably are of considerable antiquity. Inferences attempting to go beyond that are de rigeur moving into the area of fanciful speculation, if not outright fantasy. There is no evidence pointing unambiguously, or even obliquely, to the prehistoric existence of worship of a supreme deity of monotheistic dimensions, which would transcend the usual framework of to- temic conceptions as known from historical times throughout Australia. To see evidence in anthropo- morphic representations found in rock engravings in south-east Australia (e.g., near Sydney) by inter- preting them as depictions of such a supreme god, must remain highly doubtful. So-called Bunjil's cave in the Grampian National Park is such a case 1 The Rainbow Serpent is perhaps rivalled as the longest enduring religious concept by the mother goddess cult of the European paleolithic. This concept of a female fer- tility divinity (or mistress of animals, earth mother, etc.) is evidenced by so-called Venus figurines of which the Venus of Willendorf is the most famous and is estimated at about 25 000 years. A more recent find, the so-called Venus vom Galgenberg from the same region, is thought to be even older: about 30 000 years. However, in this case it is doubtful whether the figurine represents a female - it is certainly of porportions quite different from those of the Venus figures found throughout Europe and Russia. If Duerr (1984) is to be believed, the mother goddess cult continued well into the agricultural period of the Hittites, i.e., survived in some form some 20000 years or more. Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="7">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 1 5 in point. It is rather unusual. The anthropomorphic figure depicted in the cave and said to represent Bunjil, is shown in a squatting, Buddha-like pose, quite unlike the standard representation of human or human-like images in Aboriginal art. Moreover, it is painted with nonnatural colours, i.e., it clearly dates from the postcontact period (see Flood 1990: 227 f.; also 222, 272, and 279). Even if Aborigines had given such an interpretation at the time of early European contact that in itself would not have established the ancientness of the art motive or the relevant belief, and even if a painting or engraving should manifestly be of considerable antiquity, it would not unambiguously prove a specific moti- vation for having executed it in previous centuries or millennia. It is interesting that Father E. Worms seems ini- tially to have been heavily influenced by Schmidt, but later totally rejected monotheistic claims for Aboriginal religion. In an address to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies he placed the belief in a personal sky-being under the "essentials" of Aboriginal religion and as anterior to later accre- tions such as ancestor spirits, hero spirits, wan- der myths, etc. Although Worms does not quote Schmidt directly, but only refers to his work in the bibliography, the influence is clear. Certainly his argument that high sky-beings (of the type of deus otiosus), as distinct from secondary beings, are primal forms would point to a heavy intellectual debt to Schmidt, even though he does not speak of monotheism (1963: 232, 235, 247). T.G.H. Strehlow's criticism of this position is incisive and totally convincing (1963: 250). Perhaps as a consequence of Strehlow's refutation, in a later publication, Worms had totally dropped the ur- monotheistic baggage which had been so obvious in his 1963 address, and now totally turned against this notion (see below). In contemporary anthropology the previous po- larization of views has considerably lessened. In fact, the existence of quasi monotheistic beliefs among Aborigines does no longer seem to require special devices to explain their presence amidst a thoroughly totemic culture. In his classical work "The Australian Aborigines. A Portrait of their So- ciety," the leading australianist Kenneth Maddock (1972: 112 ff .) distinguishes between transcenden- tal powers and totemic powers, thus simply jux- taposing two phenomena without attempting to bring them into some kind of relationship, intel- lectually or developmentally (cf. also Maddock 1987). In a sense, the criticism by Lévi-Strauss (1969: 115) concerning Elkin's treatment of Aus- tralian totemism and his "nominalist tendencies" Anthropos 87.1992 applies here: Maddock typologically dismembers Aboriginal beliefs and comes to terms with the pieces. Totemic powers are simply those affiliated with particular social groupings and are bound to them, while transcendental ones are those not so affiliated and bound up. While the former espouse social and cosmic order, the latter transcend it. Even though Maddock admits to a certain paucity in transcendental powers in Aboriginal belief (in comparison with the wealth of totemic beliefs), he takes the veracity of ethnographic recording on the subject for granted. Indeed, while these beliefs are sticking out sufficiently to require a special category, the category itself and its presence in the Aboriginal world of beliefs does not appear to him to be in need of justification. Earlier, of course, A. Elkin ([1938] 1964: 252 ff.) and Mircea Eliade (1966) had already fully embraced the antiquity and veracity of All-Father beliefs in Australia. Eliade speaks of a pretotemic belief. His excursion (p. 128) into the celestial connections of the All-Father and its cryptic asso- ciation with a world tree and sky ladder which sup- posedly represent an older cultural stratum must remain a very bold, but ultimately dubious spec- ulation in the mould of "Kulturhistorie." The ap- parent similarities with beliefs in Asia and Europe (in fairy tales and the shamanistic syndrome which all show features of a world tree) in itself are no sufficient proof for its antiquity. While earlier evolutionary thinkers did not wish to concede the presence of an almost monotheistic All-Father concept among Aborigines, fearful of the implications of such a fact, later views are not so encumbered. Clearly, the worldview and scientific paradigm of evolutionism did not admit the recognition of pieces of ethnographic evidence which would have contradicted it. However, this is not to say that, nowadays, anthropologists are free of prejudices or are unblinkered by paradigmatic preconceptions. The dominant underlying ideolog- ical substratum today is a benign one harking back to earlier notions of a Noble Savage. Views of Aborigines nomadically and aimlessly roaming about and parasitically living off nature have been replaced by epithets such as "resource managers," "firestick farmers," and the like stressing images of an active, purposeful, and intelligent role Ab- origines supposedly played in their relationship with the natural environment. Rather than being simply exploitative, Aborigines are seen now to have been beneficiently intervening in the work- ing of nature, and this is believed now to have yielded them a rather more comfortable way of life than was thought possible by anthropologists some</page><page sequence="8">16 Erich Kolig decades ago. The picture of Aborigines miserably eking out a living in a precarious niche grudgingly conceded them by a harsh nature has effectively been replaced by one of the Original Affluent Society, an expression coined by M. Sahlins. In line with this revised view of Aboriginal society, it must now appear much less of a puzzle that Aborigines should have developed monotheistic forms of belief, to which there is still attached a latent, residual notion of sophistication. While it is rarely stated explicitly, it appears that the debate from its inception has been en- cumbered by premises for which there is no basis in fact and which are highly "ideologically" tinged. Even modern anthropology does not seem to be free of such biases which sometimes seem to just be inversions of 19th century prejudices. 3. A Christian Derivative Leaving this problem aside, there appears to be yet another misconception saliently associated with the High God question. As Schmidt ([1912] 1926: 147) says, this belief in a Supreme Being must be seen as a kind of monotheism. Even though this being is anthropomorphic, the qualifying charac- teristic is that he is the guardian of moral behaviour in this life and the afterlife. However, in my mind, the assumption, be it open or implied, that the so-called All-Father belief represents a monotheis- tic form, is totally misplaced. The character of a sky-god, master of heavens, principal creator, etc., does not necessarily signal monotheism stricto sensu. As Zeus, the Father figure of the Greak pantheon, was only a primus inter pares, any prin- cipal deity may just be one among a multitude of deities. Indeed, celestial gods with attributes of supremacy over others occur in several cultures, and while they may be physically and symboli- cally elevated, it remains misleading to speak of monotheism. Baal Shamaim, the Lord of Heavens, was generally recognized by all Phoenicians, but was especially venerated in Byblos in the 10th century BC (see Ribichini 1988: 106). It has yet to be suggested that the Phoenicians of Byblos were monotheistic in their religious practice. Similarly, in Aboriginal culture, the All-Father was no more than one among several diverse divine beings, most of them clearly totemic. He was embedded in a network of deities with whom he stood in a kinship relationship as father, husband, etc. Evans-Pritchard went even as far as suggesting that "a theistic religion need not be either mono- theistic or polytheistic. It may be both. It is a question of the level, or situation, of thought rath- er than exclusive types of thought" (1956: 316). (R. Horton suggests [1967: 62] that which of such theistic forms are coming to the fore in a particular situation depends on the level on which explana- tions are sought for empirical events.) The Phoenician example may throw a signif- icant light on the issue. Phoenician city states developed each a particular godhead of the pan- Phoenician pantheon and elevated him or her to supremacy over the rest. This was used as a device to underline one's separate identity as well as stress political autonomy. Placed at the summit of a local pantheon, the supreme godhead sym- bolized, through its status and relationship with other gods, the power of the particular city state. The godhead was celebrated in feasts and rituals, the distinctiveness of worship and ritual trappings being used as a marker of social and especially political distinctiveness. These data not only point to a political reason rather than a theological or intellectual one in developing quasi monotheistic features, but also show the ease of transition from polytheism to a semblance of monotheism - an ease that could have been employed equally well in arriving from a totemic multitude to a supreme deity. Let us look in more detail at the figure of the Aboriginal All-Father. On closer inspection, the ethnographic evidence points to a Christian origin of several features of this concept. (Even though Eliade remarks [1966: 1 15] that Howitt had convincingly disproved Curr's objections and his claim that the Aboriginal All-Father is simply the product of missionary influence, this is not so.) I am not asserting that the All-Father figure as a whole was a crude "import" of an ethnically alien concept. Much rather it was a form well adapted to suit Aboriginal needs as perceived by them at the time and was developed both from indigenous totemic roots and a process of Aboriginalization of salient Christian ideas. A closer examination of the evidence bespeaks the Christian origin of the All-Father concept, and other circumstantial evidence points to postcontact modification of traditional belief. When Howitt, Mathews, and others recorded the All-Father figure they placed it at the centre of the Bora ritual (or rituals with different names but the same function among various "tribes"; such as the Jeraeil, the Kuringal, and the Burbung). The Bora was mainly a male initiation ceremo- ny involving earth-sculptures of the All-Father, various other effigies, the revelation of esoteric secrets, bullroarers, toothevulsion, etc. Mathews Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="9">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 1 7 (1895: 416) mentions that among the effigies con- i structed on the Bora ground was the body of ; a bullock formed from logs, earth, and a real i bullock's skull complete with horns; and that of &lt; a man dressed in old clothes in the manner of a i scarecrow and adorned with a crescent-shaped tin plate (resembling the brass breast plates handed &lt; out to prominent Aborigines and declaring them | as "kings" of a tribe). There were also represen- ; tations of a horse and parts of a vehicle and the effigies of humankind's original parents Boobarby and Numbardy (415) - which seems to be an ; allusion to Adam and Eve. Another alien element i was obviously the use of flags in the Bora ritual : by which groups of female guardians marked their : presence (425). &lt; Equally striking and clearly indicative of post- contact intrusion is the use of earth-pictures, scratched into the ground, of bulls and pigs, which in the course of the ritual were symbolically &lt; speared - an action to which R. Berndt attributes "increase intent" (Berndt 1974: 44, pictures pp. 49 and 56). The appearance of such paraphernalia is re- markable and should not be overlooked in its potential for signalling change. Not infrequently is this phenomenon accompanied by a change in motivation or some kind of adjustment to new cir- cumstances. Even if the ritual in the form observed by Howitt and others is faithful to the original, there is the possibility of discontinuity with the past in terms of the ideas and motivations which inspire its performance. Howitt (Fison and Howitt 1967: 186) himself draws attention to the wide- spread breakdown of old customs and the intrusive effect of Christianity in Gippsland. Areas of New South Wales may have been similarly affected. One wonders how this erosion of old customs goes with the perpetuation of a traditional ritual if this was not linked in one form or another to the impact of Christianity or to the presence of an alien culture in general. Howitt also indicated that this ceremony had previously lapsed and had been revived only recently. Such a break in a ritual practice, its discontinuation and subsequent revival, is certainly of some significance and is a very likely indicator of changes in meaning and motivation. R. Berndt may have put his finger on the prob- lem when he writes (1974: 29) with respect to Kuringal, Burbung, and Bora that they expressed a preoccupation with a hereafter and thus were in contrast to other Aboriginal ritual which was more concerned with fertility and the here and now. (Berndt says this despite his attributing "increase Anthropos 87.1992 intent" to the spearing of the earth-pictures; see above.) Perhaps the difference in "flavour" be- tween those rituals celebrating the All-Father and other traditional ritual is due to the postcontact character of the former. Moreover, Howitt (Fison and Howitt 1967: 210) described the All-Father figure with distinct Euro- pean and Christian attributes such as that he was associated with cattle, were sitting on a throne with pillars of crystal rising on the sides thus in fact describing a truly non-Aboriginal imagery, as for instance Worms did not fail to point out (1968: 241). In the context of describing the Bora ritual of which she seems to have had only a rather superficial knowledge, Mrs. Parker also speaks of a crystal seat on which Baiarne is supposed to sit (1905: 76), and speaks of "prayers" being addressed to Baiarne (1905: 8, 79). Unfortunately, she does not elaborate on whether she meant pray- ers in a Christian sense, or whether she referred to a traditional Aboriginal incantation. Aborigines believed that Baiarne had threatened, if they would not keep the Bora rites, he would make Aborigines die out and only white devils would live in the land (1905: 76). The white devils most probably refer to Europeans and their increasingly numerous pres- ence among Aborigines. This clearly points to the change in motivation for the ritual's performance I have referred to above. The All-Father is often described as a powerful, all-good deity who has opposed an evil trickster and punished him thus relieving mankind of a spiritual oppressor. The polarization of good and evil is as un-Aboriginal as it is characteristically Christian. Tylor (1873: 419), in referring to the ethnographic record, refers to Turamullun as "the chief demon" who has a serpent as associate. (If it is the Rainbow Serpent which was meant by Aborigines, this would indicate the totemic nature of the belief, otherwise it would point clearly to a Christian origin.) Also, the fact that the All-Father was said to have a son (or sons) shows more than just a superficial semblance to the Christian trinity (e.g., Howitt 1904: 502). Eliade in his thorough study of the All-Father concept (1966: 111) refers to myths which speak of the Supreme Being as having caused a cosmic cataclysm and thus almost having brought about the end of mankind in a fit of anger. Does this not remind one of the Biblical my theme of the deluge? His disappearance into the sky is said to have brought to an end a fabulous period on earth. This is quite in tune with the totemic belief that at the end of the Dreamtime the divine beings removed themselves from the surface of the earth,</page><page sequence="10">18 Erich Kolig choosing either a chthonian or a celestial retreat, after which the human phase began. While the Dreamtime could well be described by Aborigines as a "fabulous period" rich in magical power and mystery this notion of a "fabulous period on earth" seems to have rather the flavour of the Garden of Eden. With a minimum of modification of tradi- tional beliefs, inspired by Christian thought, one arrives at these notions. Characteristically, the material cited by Schmidt in support of his "Hochgott" argument often shows clearly to a less biased mind the undeniable Chris- tian influence and thus proves the exact opposite of his point. For instance in vol. 1 of his "Der Ursprung der Gottesidee" (1926: 355) he describes Mamengorook (which means "our father") of the Gippsland Aborigines, by using attributes such as "white, very clean, and of great lustre and glory." Leaving aside the telling attribute of whiteness, the characteristics of cleanliness and glory reflect European values and are totally meaningless in Aboriginal culture. Cleanliness (whether next to godliness or not) has no importance to Aborigines and if specifically attributed to a deity by them must have a source other than traditional culture. Mamengorook, incidentally, is counterpoised by evil spirits from whom all evil stems. Again, the juxtaposition of good and evil is totally un- Aborig- inal. On p. 351 (1926) Schmidt mentions a creation story in which Bunjil shapes a dark-skinned and a light-skinned man. This story obviously is meant to point out the fact of two different skin colours, black and white, and to express the notion that both are equally worthy as god's creation. Only missionary teaching could be the source of this idea. The many creation stories cited by Schmidt in the same context (1934: 842) and in which man and woman are said to have been formed by the supreme creator from clay and mud, reveal equally thoughts of Christian provenance. The concept of afterlife is similarly indicative. Even a scholar unfamiliar with Aboriginal culture should harbour few doubts about the true origin of such a vision of an afterlife as described by Schmidt: the wrong- doer enters an underworld where he is tortured and burnt in a fire by Eleanbah Wundah, while the good souls ascend to heaven which is rich in flowers (851 f.). Thus Schmidt's "evidence" cited in support of his "Hochgott" argument achieves the exact opposite from what he intends: it points to a Christian source. Others, who had the same preconception, al- so inadvertently put their finger on the Christian flavour of those beliefs they thought were autoch- thonous to Australia. Salvado himself draws atten- tion to the close resemblance between Aboriginal beliefs and the words of the Bible (see above), apparently naively assuming the likeness to be coincidental. The figure of the evil spirit Cienga (also rendered as "mallo," 1977: 258) he translates as devil and so unwittingly comes close to the truth. B. Smyth in describing the belief in Baiarne - and incidentally in so doing drawing heavily on the work of missionaries - lapses into the language of Christianity when he says that Aborigines at- tribute immortality, power, and goodness to this deity. The maker of earth, water, and sky delivered humanity from the demon of evil and welcomes the dead to a paradise of peace and plenty in the sky (Smyth 1876/11: 285). Father E. A. Worms, an expert of Aboriginal religion through years of firsthand experience, saw clearly the un- Aboriginal character of the All-Fa- ther concept: "In biblischer Weise, aber durch- aus unaustralisch, wurde Baiami das Richteramt nach dem Tode zugeschrieben und eine 'apoka- lyptische Größe und Erhabenheit' beigelegt, was einem Adaptionsversuch Ehre tut, aber die origina- len Gedankengänge der australischen Mythologie verwischt" (1968: 241), he remarks sceptically but aptly. His analysis reveals the essentially totemic character of the Supreme Beings. Bundjil is the eagle hawk married to two swan wives. His sons are birds and bats. Lun or Mungan-ngaua is the pelican. And as birds are always connected with the sky it is not inconceivable that the traditional pantheon placed these totemic figures in the sky or among the stars. Worms also cites evidence that missions made liberal use of these concepts to translate them into Christian parlance and use them for their teachings. Thus "Bundjil Maman . . . fand . . . Eingang in die Bibelübersetzungen, Gebetsformen und Kirchengesänge der ersten Mis- sionare Victorias und wurde mit 'Gott oder erste Ursache' übersetzt" (1968: 235). In Gippsland, Mungan-ngaua was translated by the missionaries as God (238). Even though it is not clear whether at the time the adaptation by missionaries was done, Baiami, Mungan-ngaua, etc., were still to- temic or already exalted, or whether their exalted position in Aboriginal belief is a result of the missionaries' interest in this concept. But at least it shows the interpénétration of Aboriginal and Christian concepts from a very early period on. Worms' material further suggests that deities with similar celestial or basic creative characteristics existed throughout Australia, but in most areas were not activated into becoming Supreme Beings after the Christian model, as it seems to have happened in south-east Australia on a larger scale. Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="11">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 19 Spencer and Gillen (1904: 498 ff.) recorded a myth about a sky god Atnatu who had created himself before alcheringa, the Dreamtime. He had wives and sons, also called Atnatu, some of whom neglected his sacred services and were expelled from the sky. This mytheme has an uncanny re- semblance with the Biblical fall from grace of some angels and their banishment to the nether- world. Another mytheme from the region, cited by Schmidt ([1912] 1926: 155) with approval, seems even more obviously influenced by Christian ideas. The Aranda's emu-footed Great Father in the Sky was said to possess long blond hair and reddish skin (see also T.G.H. Strehlow 1963: 250 and 1964: 725). It has to be said that the reference to blond hair in itself is not directly indicative of European influence, as blond hair occurs in the central Australian Aboriginal population and is not the result of miscigenation. However, in con- junction with red skin complexion it does suggest another interpretation. A Supreme Being to whom Spencer and Gil- len devoted a great deal of attention (1927/1: 355 f.), was "unmasked" by T.G.H. Strehlow (1970: 138 f.) as a missionary concoction. Inka- ta Alchera Numbkalla, the name of the Supreme Being, actually means Lord God Eternal, and this composite label was given to the Christian God by the Lutheran missionaries at Hermannsburg. Undeniably, a piece of foreign influence is re- vealed in the following information. According to Eylmann (1908: 183) the Narinyeri travel myth about Ngurrunduri (his spelling) starts from the northpole loo-ung-poon-thulg. Ngurrunduri, inci- dentally, accepts the souls of the dead into heav- en (189). I find revealing an incident to which Frazer (1910: 151 f.) draws attention. Someone enquir- ing about the Supreme Being Brewin among the Kurnai, questioned two men of whom one was a member of the church of England. After consulting together, they came up with the answer that they thought he was Jesus Christ. When their answer proved unsatisfactory to the enquirer who believed he knew better, they put their heads together again and finally declared that he was the devil (original- ly from Fison and Howitt 1967: 255). But while Howitt does not draw any conclusions, obvious as they may seem, from this, Frazer sees it as proof of the unreliability of Aboriginal informa- tion about their beliefs. Clearly they have been "contaminated" by Christianity. To my mind the incident shows three things. First, that Aborigines were sufficiently well informed about Christian beliefs and conversant with the relative importance Anthropos 87.1992 of these concepts to European thinking. Second, it shows that Aborigines were not adverse to reinterpreting (at least vis-à-vis Europeans) their traditional beliefs in terms of Christianity when the situation demanded that their traditional culture be made intelligible to outsiders. And thirdly, it may show that Aborigines were not adverse to reinterpreting their traditional religion and culture in the light of new theological information beyond the convenience or demand of the moment or to satisfy the curiosity of some Europeans, but rather to take up an intellectual challenge. Thus to demonstrate not just the compatibility of their traditional beliefs with Christianity but perhaps to demonstrate the equality of their beliefs and thus make an implied statement about the status of two cultures. For practical reasons it is not possible to cite more data. But even so, one conclusion must be drawn. The entire available material on the ex- istence of a belief in a supreme deity, a benev- olent sky-dwelling creator, in Aboriginal culture, is so riddled with more or less obvious analogies to, and resemblances with, Christian theological ideas (and other foreign influences), as to become totally unsuitable for establishing the concept's indigenous authenticity. The number and quality of resemblances exceed any coincidental conver- gence that can reasonably be expected to occur. The only conclusion justly to be drawn is that such resemblances are the outcome of a process of incorporation of salient and well-known Christian elements into the traditional religious framework or of adaptation of traditional religious concepts to a Christian frame of reference. The All-Father on balance must be taken as an in-principle Ab- original totemic belief on which some Christian features were bestowed which, in turn, made this concept more conspicuous to ethnographers. Ap- pealing to ethnographers' sense of the unusual and extraordinary, by the fact of the existence of such a concept of great similarity with Christian belief among a people so vastly different from European society, it was likely to be given prominence in ethnographic recording at the expense of other totemic beliefs. Unfortunately, when data about these beliefs and myths were gathered last century, little care was taken to check their authenticity, to trace possible Christian influences, and to record the context in which such information was given and by whom. The problem is compounded by the fact that some ethnographic sources can be faulted for their obvious exaggeration and inaccuracy. There is suf- ficient evidence to suggest that it is sometimes the</page><page sequence="12">20 Erich Kolig ethnographer's own bias which is at fault when a perfectly ordinary totemic creature is endowed with a new exaltedness not inherent in the in- formation received from Aborigines. Typical is a passage from W. Wyatt's account (1879: 166) in which he writes about a "principal personage" of the mythology, a big "Monaincherloo" or "Teendo yerle, sunfather" who is said to have made sun, moon, stars, men, and "plenty of things." Wyatt feels justified to surmise: ". . . by which is probably meant all things," thus arriving at an omnipotent creator figure. From Taplin's description of the so-called Su- preme Being Nurundere or Matummere (the spell- ing varies) it does not follow that this being was of such exaltedness as to justify the label Highgod. The Narrinyeri relate "many ridiculous traditions about his doings ..." (1878: 55 ff.), though they name him "with reverence." On closer inspection Nurundere' s myth does not seem to be different from any ordinary travel myth in which geograph- ical features are brought into being by accidental or whimsical acts of the particular myth being wandering about and minding his/her own busi- ness and without exhibiting a particular sense of responsibility for posterity or humanity. Nurun- dere creates small islands and other similar things, rather than the whole world (see Meyer 1879: 205; Schürmann 1879: 238 f.). The myth was later re- corded by R. Berndt (1940), and in his rendition it fits perfectly the normal pattern of a totemic travel myth. Berndt concludes: ". . . although Ngurunderi appears to be of major importance, it would be difficult to grade him in relation to other mythic beings. All of them were responsible in different ways for establishing the culture of the Narinyeri people, and all were religious beings. In other words, it does not seem appropriate to speak of any of them as supreme beings . . ." (1974: 26). Similarly, the All-Father belief of central Aus- tralia to some extent appears to be the result of an exaggeration on the part of the ethnogra- pher. C. Strehlow (1907: 1 f.) speaks of Altjira as "höchstes gutes Wesen" and "guter Gott," while in fact there does not seem to be a ranking order which would place Altjira above other Dreamtime beings, nor are there any attributes of morali- ty or beneficence apparent which would justify Strehlow' s characterization. In fact, he mentions that Altjira is not concerned with human affairs, and that the Aranda neither fear nor love him. Clearly, the recorder's Christian predisposition had a heavy influence here on the presentation of the ethnographic data. One of the outstanding features of the Highgod concept is that he appears to stand above and beyond the totemic order which otherwise encom- passes the whole world, physical and metaphysi- cal. This transcendence does not always seem to be an accurate portrayal. Bundjil - one of the Highgod figures -, for instance, is also Eagle Hawk and as such is closely associated with one moiety, and so is Krokitch, another of the many High Gods, who is White Cockatoo, the totem of a particular moiety. Both are in a contrasting, or complementary, relationship with Crow and Black Cockatoo, their respective moiety opposites (see Schmidt [1912] 1926: 339). As mentioned before, there is the distinct possi- bility that European inquirers asked leading ques- tions, weaving in Christian ideas of their own in the process. Bride (1898: 258) addresses this problem of the Aborigines' suggestibility, when he says that any information received from them has to be treated cautiously: . . . "they will at any time admit or say anything which they think will please their interlocutor. ... in short, if leading questions are put to them, as is usually done by enthusiastic inquirers, who are following up their own ideas, they [the natives] may, I think, be made to say or describe anything." That many ethnographers may have approached the problem by asking goal-directed questions already loaded with preconceptions should hardly be doubted. In a sense this problem of biased inquiry is exemplified in a letter by Hugh Jamieson to Bishop Perry from 10 October 1853 (in Bride 1898: 381): "As regards their religious opinions," he writes, "they [the Aborigines of the lower Murray and Arling] have none; they have no knowledge whatever of a Supreme Being." Apparently he had made a direct inquiry to this effect, probably portraying an image very like the Christian God, and, encoun- tering either honest or slow-witted informants, had received a negative answer. At least in this case the well-known "suggestibility" of Aborigines had not had the upper hand. The central and characteristic feature of Aborig- inal religion as it was found and amply recorded from throughout Australia is of course "totemism." Despite some cultural variation, there was a fairly uniform set of beliefs in a theriomorphic pantheon consisting of thousands of divine beings most in the form of animals or plants. None of these were accredited with unlimited powers, be they creative or destructive, and in a moral sense they, having mostly human-like needs and wants, espoused a mixture of good and evil. The world as it tradi- tionally existed was believed to have been formed in the Dreamtime, the primordial creative epoche, Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="13">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 21 by the exploits and adventures of these beings, but not by way of a creatio ex nihilo; rather through a gradual process of shaping and transforming of the landscape. Similarly, the sociocultural medium was believed to have emerged as the traditional and enduring forms with which Aboriginal man traditionally was familiar, through the somewhat cumbersome trial and error process undergone by these beings. The evidence of this creative work by the Dreamtime heroes was then seen to be in the plethora of shapes and features of the land- scape all around and in the customs and practices of traditional society. At the end of the creative period the new world had been handed over to human beings whose duty it was now to ensure the continued existence and regeneration of the world without any alterations or additions. This formed the ideological basis for the performance of ritual, all of them designed in one form or another to uphold and to ensure the unchanged continuation of the received structure of the world. All ritual and indeed all human activity was seen as the recreation of sacred precedent, while any change, introduced accidently or wilfully, was believed to bring with it the danger of collapse of the world order. The entire Aboriginal society was organized in terms of distinct groupings of a kinship and totemic nature (clans, sections, moieties, etc.). The characteristic was that all of them were linked to, and represented by natural species, by spiritual beings, and by parts of the geographical landscape where relevant mythical deeds had occurred in the Dreamtime. The groups in Aboriginal society were thus related not only to each other by this system but even more intimately to nature, to the land and to the structure of the world itself. "For in Aus- tralia the operation of the concept of the totemic landscape ensured that such things as the stabil- ity of tribal boundaries and of linguistic groups, the distribution of interlocking and intermarrying subgroups, and even the firm establishment of authority - and hence of the agencies of social control, and of law and order - were all based on the geographic environment" (T. G. H. Strehlow 1970: 92). Clearly, the concept of a Supreme Being ap- pears to be at odds with this view of the whole of the world, society and indeed creation and the metaphysical world being pervaded and dominated by a cosmological structure which divides all these spheres equally and by the same rules. It clearly does not fit with the system of totemism where- by groups are related to a particular or a set of animals, plants, or natural phenomena which are Anthropos 87.1992 considered sacred and whose relations also deter- mine, or reflect, the relations governing human in- teraction. A divine being which is totally outside of these totemic relationships would have no part and no apparent function in determining the nature of these relationships. As the structure of the religion and the structure of society were intimately related and virtually co-variable, one would expect the presence of divinities to be intimately interwoven with this structure. Also, the creative function at- tributed to the Supreme Being, as a single dom- inant creator, does not fit the Dreamtime scheme of things. It is in direct opposition to the notion of many and separately acting Dreamtime beings interacting and forming the world, as if almost by accident, through their individual piecemeal actions. The resultant creation, bringing about a restructured world and an ordered society, is a pastiche of a multitude of whimsical, human-like acts, the by-product of beings who selfishly went about their own business with little regard for human posterity. The concept of a supreme creator who takes a benign interest in the welfare of his human progeny that comes after him, sits uneasily in this totemic, theriomorphic pantheon. If this Supreme Being then really is an introduc- tion into traditional Aboriginal religion, and not solely the invention of biased ethnographers asking leading questions, the question may be asked why it is obviously associated with many traditional Aboriginal cultural and social forms and how such a wealth of beliefs and practices conjoined with this deity could have sprung up around it in such a relatively short period of time. Associated with this question is the problem why this concept, if it is indeed of Christian provenance, does not exhibit a more distinctly Christian flavour, making it easier to discern its origin? The point is that this belief did not need to be developed from nothing, nor does it represent simply a piece of alien importation. The most likely course of events for the concept's develop- ment seems to have been for the Aborigines, who seem to have been exposed to missionary teach- ing for some time, to take a traditional totemic figure and endow it with some of the qualities and characteristics of the Christian creator god. By so doing, the rites and traditional associations connected with the totemic deity would remain in place and, if so desired, could be added to, for instance, by including the postcontact features mentioned before. The whole concept then could now simply be projected as above and outside the traditional totemic order thus assuming now an all-encompassing magnitude.</page><page sequence="14">22 Erich Kolig There is considerable evidence for this view. Bird-like totemic deities existed throughout Aus- tralia, as Worms has aptly pointed out (1968: 233, 238, 239, etc.), lending themselves readily for an association with a god of an exalted, celestial abode such as the Christian one. Not surprisingly many of the All-Father figures have also a flip side which reveals them as birds such as pelicans or eagle hawks (as mentioned before). (Bunjil, for instance, means eagle hawk; Howitt in Fison and Howitt 1967: 210). Both Tylor and Worms contend that such beliefs are likely to have arisen as a result of a confusion in translation and transmis- sion of Christian ideas, words, and concepts into Aboriginal terms and ideas. In trying to convey their message the missionaries used already ex- isting Aboriginal terms; whether they did so on their own accord or prompted by Aborigines does not matter. The traditional Dreamtime heroes were therefore used as analogies for Christian concepts. Worms relates (1968: 235) how Bunjil, the eagle hawk hero, as Bunjil Maman found entry into the Biblical translation, prayers, and hymns of the first missionaries of Victoria, and was translated as God or primary cause. Presumably, the eagle hawk totem has as much to do traditionally with primary causes as the multitude of other totemic heroes - namely only in a very limited sense. Worms concludes aptly (1968: 232): "The existing material and our observations over many years as well as those of Stanner's and T. G. H. Strehlow's do not provide sufficient ground to assume they [the Aborigines] had a belief in one god, let alone a High God" (my translation). 4. Christianity and Power Christianity has had many and varied effects on traditional religions and worldviews in various societies with which it had come into contact. In some instances this has resulted in the total or partial embracement of the Christian faith, in others it had entailed considerable modification of the gospel before it became acceptable. In some instances syncretistic forms sprung up which are still easily discernible as Christian-derived. And in yet other cases, a much subtler and clandes- tine influence has been exerted by Christianity, leaving the autonomy and integrity of the indig- enous religion seemingly intact and revealing its presence only after careful analysis. In such cases, Christian elements and symbols have been uplifted from their original context and grafted onto and incorporated into the indigenous religious system weaving them in so tightly as to all but obliterate their origin. So-called millenarian or chiliastic movements are attempts to rally religious or magical powers to a political cause, be it to regenerate or reju- venate a traditional form of society or to create an entirely new, unprecedented one. Revelations and soteriological elements of such movements in historical, colonial times often show a distinc- tive Christian influence. Christian elements, for instance, are present in the various millenarian movements of the 19th and early 20th century in Maori society, which form examples of the more obvious and noticeable intrusion of Christian elements (cf. Elsmore 1987). The grafting of the black Jesus Jinimin belief on the traditional cult of Worgaia in north-west Australia is also a fairly distinct form of Christian-indigenous syncretism (see Petri and Petri-Odermann 1970: 258 f.). Less obvious is perhaps the case of the Jon Frum move- ment on Tanna in Vanuatu. While the cross and the use of Christian icons (such as pictures of Christ and the Virgin Mary) are beyond doubt as to their origin, the theme of a saviour and the expected second coming of Jon Frum espouse less obviously Christian messianism. (A clue is provided by the history of the movement which reveals that it was started by Tannese who had previously embraced Christianity, but then became disenchanted with it; see, e.g., J. Guiart 1951: 229.) The myth of Io in postcontact Maori society, equally, represents a case where it remains debatable whether Christian influence was at its roots (see Kolig 1987). The first and foremost question which then needs to be addressed is why such symbols are found isolated from their Christian context. All of these examples stem from a situation of culture contact between Western civilization and indig- enous societies. Such a situation is not simply an intellectual encounter but first and foremost physical and intensely political. In such situations the potential for change is enormous, regardless of whether the indigenous societies involved had previous experience of contact with other societies, or not. The entire system of relations within such a society which may have been quite stable and durable before, is suddenly thrown into jeopardy. And what is more, a new system of relations emerges linking it to the encroaching society. Not only would there appear alternatives to the institu- tions of power on which the society is traditionally based, but the position of the society in relation to the encroaching one becomes critically acute. There are often no developed institutions and sometimes no cognitive instrumentariums within Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="15">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 23 such societies to deal with and cope with the ensuing relationship between the two societies, yet some way must be found to address the new situation. The potential problematic for a society in this position is increased enormously if the culture with which it has come into contact is clearly domi- nant - as is the case with Western civilization. In such situations Western society as a whole remains characteristically unperturbed, largely unchanged, and supremely confident of its own dominance and superiority. Adjustments of any kind are largely to be made on the part of the indigenous society. Basically, the society is faced with one major problem: it must either try and address this deficit in power or resign itself to the prospect of be- coming subservient to, or consumed by, Western civilization. There are a number of options by which a society could react to the encroachment by West- ern society, or any other dominant one. It could attempt to alter the balance of power through physical means (i.e., direct confrontation and war- fare), through political or social manoeuvering, through economic strategies, or through metaphys- ical means. Of these, with all but the last one, in many cases there is little chance of success, short term or in the long run. Given this dilemma, the obvious road towards altering the relations of power is one which can operate at an internal level of the particular society thus without the dominant society becoming acutely aware of it. So when other more pragmatic methods of em- powering oneself vis-à-vis a dominant society fail or are recognized a priori as unsuccessful, it is likely that symbolic, magico-religious means will be brought into play. The institution of religion in many indigenous societies is one which by nature lends itself to this purpose as its function is to deal with relations of power, be they of a natural or social kind. In indigenous societies religion and political and social structures are commonly closely inter- twined. If this is the case, then it is likely that religion would not appear to be existing above or independent of the sociopolitical order. The forces of religion would be believed to be active not just on a supernatural, metaphysical plane, but would be seen as closely tied to and concerned with success or failure in the secular political and social realms. Sahlins (1985) in putting forward his concept of "mythopraxis," has argued that indigenous cultures in contact situations inevitably try and deal with the situation in terms of their traditional forms of Anthropos 87.1992 understanding (a point I have made also some time ago; cf. Kolig 1972). It is therefore reasonable to assume that indigenous societies on the basis of their traditional perception see a similar relation- ship between Christianity, the religion of Western society, and its symbols and customary actions on the one hand and the sociopolitical institutions of Western society and the power these muster on the other. If this is the case, then the sphere of religion, both in terms of Western and indigenous one, in fact presents itself as the proper medium in and with which to operate in order to bring about desired effects in the sociopolitical arena. As I have already hinted, the Aboriginal High God belief is not just the result of intellectual spec- ulation to satisfy a need to explain primal causes, or a construct expressive of a new postcontact morality, but a reflection of social and political conditions. It has arisen out of the conflict between two peoples of which one side, namely Europeans, asserted its claim to the higher divinity and under- lined it with political dominance. The Christian theological claim that God from an elevated posi- tion had created all, oversees and knows all and controls all was supported by political conditions on the ground, where those people espousing this belief were in a similarly "controlling" position. The question remains to be answered why would Aborigines attempt to incorporate Christian elements into their traditional religious system, or into those parts which were retained or revived from a crumbling traditional cultural world. Curi- ously, it is Freud who, despite his assumption that Aborigines were incapable of religion, has advo- cated a view of monotheism which may be useful in interpreting the puzzle, by drawing attention to the political roots of monotheism. In his book on Moses and monotheism ([1939] 1975: 36 f., 130) he discusses the rise of Mosaic monotheism and the roots it may have in the Egyptian worship of the sun god Ra. Ra too originally was one in a multifacetted pantheon but was elevated as the sole deity by Pharao Echnathon. The Hebrews, desirous of strengthening their identity and cultural distinctiveness, as well as trying to maintain ethnic purity, adopted this belief of their oppressors once they had broken free. Freud's historical data and their use in reconstructing these ancient events may be questionable, but his implicit reasoning is interesting. Though perhaps drawing the wrong inferences, his chain of argument is stimulating. Freud extends his political view of monotheism by arguing that quasi-monotheistic forms may arise when various tribes enter a confederacy. Their gods are assembled into a "family" over which</page><page sequence="16">24 Erich Kolig one assumes primacy. Freud's argument may be dubious and questionable in more ways than one, but one must give him credit for relentlessly pressing the point that religious beliefs in gener- al and monotheistic ones in particular, are to be seen as reflections of power relationships "on the grounds." This can be usefully supplemented by the view that religion per se, in addition to its concern with rendering meaning to human exis- tence, is also concerned with power (albeit not in the specific Marxist sense of social power through delusion, but rather in the Weberian sense of a societal power programme). Seen in these terms, on one level the All-Father concept seems to be a case of Aborigines adjusting the indigenous pantheon to underline, not just a basic compatibility of their belief system with Christianity, but to assert theological equality. It serves as an implicit statement on the worth of their cultural tradition as a whole. The aim, I would submit, of this process of theological re-thinking was to establish the essential worth of indigenous traditions whereby the foreign creed, as the one of the powerful and dominant society, is conceded the status of giving a benchmark of worth or unworth. Thus the All-Father belief in Aboriginal reli- gion is not a crude, unreflected graft so as to produce a fake-similarity. This I find paralleled in Vanuatu today where there also are moves afoot in various Christian churches to reinterprete their dogma so as to assert the essential worth of in- digenous culture. In the search of the cultural past for relevances and reference points to relate it to the present, and thus to give guidance, there is an interpretation abroad that Christian principles were espoused already by traditional Vanuatuan culture and that it enshrined principles which were also claimed by missionary Christianity later. This is to claim that there was an indigenous Christianity inherent in the traditional culture, its customs were informed by a Christian spirit and morality, pre- dating the arrival of the European missionaries. In other words, Vanuatuan Christianity is actually a pre-Christian, indigenous one, or, inversely, tradi- tional culture, when measured against Christianity, the religion of the dominant society (or former colonial master), is equally worthy. M. Taussig in his excellent study of shamanism and violence in South America (1987: 467) writes that the Indians have drawn the Christian God into an explanation of their halluzinogenic drug yage. But God in this context is not the all-powerful, omniscient creator. He is surprised when Indians offer him yage. He has to learn its use and effects. He tries it out and, as a consequence, "he vomits, trembles, weeps, and shits" like any other man consuming the drug. He learns from suffering as every shaman using yage does. In fact, God is so imperfect, so far from being all-knowing that he has to learn from Indians. He does not seem to realize the implications of his creation, if, in fact, he is credited with having created the yage plant. God is here clearly humanized, by bringing him down to a very earthy level - to the level of the Indians who, in their own eyes, have a status lower than Europeans. God is portrayed as imperfect, in need of learning like any other ignorant human being, and indeed he has to learn not from the clever Europeans with all their technology, but from "ignorant" Indians. Moreover, how could demoting God be better stressed than by attribut- ing to him functions of the digestive tract. The Czech novelist Milan Kundera in his novel "Die unerträgliche Leichtigkeit des Seins" (1988: 235) frivolously wonders whether God has intestines. Clearly this is theologically inconceivable, perhaps the ultimate blasphemy, even though man is said to have been created in his image and God therefore must be human-like in many respects. Indians, by using Christian imagery, reformulating it and building it into their traditional culture, make a strong statement about the relative position of two cultures vis-à-vis each other. That is one possibility of using Christian con- cepts to express power relationships between groups or societies, and thus "intellectually" to try to redress or compensate for power deficiencies. Aborigines in south-east Australia have seemingly chosen another option to achieve the same effect: they have attempted to elevate their theology to what they perceived as the Christian level by approximating some of their beliefs to what they knew or learned from their Christian overlords. The presence of Christian symbols and mean- ings in traditional contexts should, however, not be examined simply in terms of the relation between two religious systems. Such an approach would only be able to consider these symbols in terms of their "meanings" within different cosmologies, or as embellishments of new exotic deities and concepts for traditional belief systems. Rather, one should consider the purpose for which Christian elements have been incorporated. The inclusion of such foreign elements then should be analysed as forms of symbolic action - an action which is directed primarily at trying to rectify a perceived deficit in the balance of power. It should be clear now that the conflict with which we are dealing here is not so much a conflict between systems of belief or deities as Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="17">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 25 between social systems, and that this conflict is being played out at a symbolic level. A view which dealt with this issue simply as a religious conflict would seriously miss the point, misinterpret the nature of religion in indigenous societies, and, ultimately, could not account for the degree of syncretism which historically occurred. If it were for indigenous societies only a conflict between two religious systems, carried out on a "theological level" of intellectual debate, a different pattern would emerge. A theological rivalry would result in the Christian doctrines being decried as false by the indigenous society, as much as Christianity, be- ing disinterested in the question of empowerment vis-à-vis another society, could decry indigenous religions as heathen or pagan and as untrue. In such a perspective, there is no incentive to accept alien beliefs, and the integrity and desirability of existing beliefs can remain intact. (Hence the unwillingness of most missionarydom to "com- promise" Christianity by allowing syncretisms or adaptations changing the purity of the gospel.) If Christianity would not in any way be associated with the political threat of an encroaching alien society, similarly there would be no incentive to come to grips with it. However, the reality is that elements of Christianity frequently in contact situations came to enter into traditional myths and religions which is in itself an admission of the perceived power of Christianity. For the symbolic statement involved in the inclusion of Christian elements to be worth making it is necessary that what is being referred to is itself worthy of con- sideration. In this case then, if these Christian elements which one often finds are thought of as themselves representative of what is powerful about Western society, their presence becomes more explicable - they are not mere theological statements but are indicative of wider relations of power. That the absorption of Christian elements into traditional religion was associated with consider- ations of power-obtainment is at least true for those Aboriginal groups which augmented their All-Father concept with forms of ritual worship (as traditional Aboriginal ritual is always concerned with power in one form or another) and perhaps to a lesser degree only for those groups who estab- lished only a conceptual link between Christianity and traditional belief forms (by drawing compari- sons, explaining one in terms of the other, etc.). At this stage it may be objected that if Chris- tianity is linked so strongly with the power of Western society, why does this not create univer- sally a desire to absorb this power by total con- Anthropos 87.1992 version? Indeed, arguments have been put forward that Christianity in this place or that had been embraced as a whole for the sake of gaining the associate power.2 In some cases, disillusionment followed, when the expected empowerment did not eventuate, and a process of turning away from Christianity resulted (as seems to have happened on Tanna and led to the formation of the Jon Frum movement). But the situation is by no means so simple. The collective reaction to the situation of cul- ture contact is dependent on many factors includ- ing the nature and intensity of contact; whether it is friendly, indifferent, hostile, genocidal, etc., whether, as in the case of missionization, it is actively seeking to change the society dominated, whether there are real or perceived opportunities for genuine advancement and integration into the dominant society, and so on. The composition and nature of the indigenous society are other variables causally involved making generalizations exceed- ingly difficult to maintain. And of course, whatever the response may be, it may not necessarily be a conscious deliberate one, a well-planned and thought-out strategy to empower oneself. In any case, rarely will people be ready to throw away their customary beliefs and embrace wholeheart- edly a foreign creed. The crucial point, I seek to make, is the experi- enced deficit of power. Power of course does not 2 In some cases, however, Christianity may have been ac- cepted not as an end, but as a means towards receiving the tools of power. In Polynesia Christianity seems to have been widely embraced not because it itself was seen as powerful, but as the only possible avenue through which the perceived instruments of power, namely literacy, could be obtained. The conversion of Polynesia resulted quasi as a by-product, since the supposed means of empowerment came inseparably packaged with the gospel. This is how Parsonson (1984) interprets the situation. Although quite plausible, there is, however, a logical inconsistency inherent in this argument. Polynesians allegedly were aware of the fact that the missionaries were suffering from a lack of power in their own society, thus reducing the attractiveness of conversion. How could the Polynesians then come to believe that the missionaries could be the bearers of a secret the obtainment of which leads to power? If Polynesians as a people made the logical inference, based on partly correct and partly incorrect observation, that literacy leads to pow- er, as enjoyed by Europeans sui generis, one would expect them to be equally logical, again supported by empirical observation, in recognizing that an apparently powerless group could hardly hold the keys to empowerment. The notion of logical risk that efforts of obtaining literacy might turn out to be in vain and that one would end up as powerless as the missionaries supposedly were, should have, again logically speaking, resulted either in inertia or in the search of empowerment by other means.</page><page sequence="18">26 Erich Kolig exist in any tangible form. Power "does not exist in a "pure form" but is always inherent in social relationships of varying types" (Cohen 1974: xi). If this is so, then we must ask how power is exercised and becomes manifest in the eyes of the people involved in the social relationships resultant from so-called culture contact. Power may exist overtly of course, such as through the successful exercise of physical force, but also through the use of symbols, through the implicit insinuation and manipulation of their relation and affinity with power. Here it is in order to briefly look at a theory of symbolism, so as to underpin my point that sym- bols are not simply "good to think with," but are "good to manipulate" because of their inherent po- tency or their ability to empower the manipulator. Symbols form a part of how the world is thought of and conceived. They can represent not only objects and be objects, but they can also be and refer to abstract entities. Thus ideas, concepts, and the spiritual world through symbolization gain an actual presence in the world. And thus sym- bolism is perhaps most often associated with re- ligion, as religion by its very nature and function is symbolic. "Everything in religion is a symbol, since the object of religion is the transcendent and the real self, and these are beyond immediate representation" (Ell wood 1979: 92). The concept of God is also a symbol, and its inclusion in a religious system is capable of performing the functions expected of symbols as such. Symbols of religion, myth, and ritual, as the works of most notably G. Bateson, C. Geertz, and Victor Turner show, form a metalanguage, a dis- course on society and the world at large. They are no mere reflexion of society, as Durkheim held, but represent critical evaluations, social commentary, social critique, idealization, and utopianization, a longing for alternatives and perfections, alterna- tive models, and the like. But at the same time, such symbols are more than an intellectualized game. Symbols and symbolic actions are capable of performing a variety of functions. "It is indeed in the very essence of the symbolic process to perform a multiplicity of functions with economy of symbolic formation" (Cohen 1974: 32). Sym- bols can express and evoke feelings and emotions. They can provide tools for communication, for representing ideas, or, as Geertz (1973: 92) points out, "[symbols can] provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes external to themselves can be given a definite form." Symbols are also a power-programme: they ex- ist in association with power, and their function is to empower. It is precisely in this sense that Euro- pean-derived symbols are often used. The Umeda villagers see hair as a symbol of potency. They imitate the cropped style of Europeans, because traditionally status and power is encoded in hair style. Europeans per se are seen as powerful, and so, if their power is to be emulated, the symbol which manifests their power must also be imitated and accepted (Gell 1975: 300). Symbols, of course, do not exist in isolation. "Meaning" is imposed upon them and is always relative to the context. Thus what may be seen as an important symbol in one culture may be totally meaningless in another, or may have a different meaning attached to it. For example, Ivo Strecker (1988: 205 ff.) relates a Hamar transition rite in which the initiate has sand poured over him. To a European watching this symbolic act it will mean little or, if it does, it will evoke different modes of meaning. The Western observer . . . "has lived his own life and this may well provide him with evocations when he watches the boy pouring sand over the initiate. Yet these evocations are specifically his own. He has imported them into the situation. This is the reason why they can't serve him as a key to an understanding" (Strecker 1988: 215). In other words, the significance of this action can only be appreciated if it is understood as part of a system of culturally specific meanings, as part of a set of cultural practices and idiomatic thinking (cf. Leach 1976: 95). The patterns of symbolic action "are provided by society and are always loaded with special con- sequences many of which are unintended by the actors" (Cohen 1974: 40). As symbolic meanings can exist on many levels, the actors may simply be unaware or unconscious of many of the possible implications. Given that the context determines to a large part the meaning of a symbol, it follows that, if it is somehow changed, then the meaning of the symbol will be altered accordingly. That is, the relation of the symbol to other symbols, objects, and events within the system of cultural understandings will be affected. Deciphering the "meaning" of sym- bols - Sperber (1975) calls this the cryptological approach and does not hold high hopes for it - is fraught with difficulties, as Bloch (1986: 183) and Cohen (1974: 5) aptly pointed out. It is mostly guesswork with little prospect of ultimate proof that it is correct. I do not propose, therefore, to argue about the meaning of symbols per se, but the meaning of symbolic action. This quality of symbols by which their mean- ings are never absolute but are always relative, Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="19">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 27 and which means that their position and meaning in relation to other symbols can be changed, gives rise to the possibility of deliberate manipulation so as to achieve just such ends. By so altering the apparent relations of the symbols in a symbolic system the relative association of the symbols may be similarly altered. Symbolic action involves the manipulation of symbolic forms to try and initiate some change in the perceived relations between symbols and therefore by extension between the things they represent. Symbolic action is usually engaged in with a purpose. It is not normally performed as an in- tellectual exercise or with the deliberate intention of fulfilling some social cohesive function for ex- ample, though indeed this may very well be an effect, intended or unintended. Symbolic action is usually intended to produce some form of tangible effect. Implied in this is that people believe that symbolic action is effective in achieving desired ends. "People who practise . . . [symbolic acts] . . . believe that they will produce desired ends. If people did not believe this one might have thought they would hardly practice [them]," says Beattie (1970: 243). Exactly how the use of symbols in trying to achieve practical effects in the real world or in a metaphysical realm is able to achieve effica- ciousness, is of course an open, as yet unanswered question. Many anthropologists have addressed themselves to this problem (cf., e.g., Beattie 1970; Lévi-Strauss 1963: 201; La Fontaine 1977; Kolig 1989: 9ff.). Others simply attribute this question to the domain of psychology and wish to confine anthropology to the study of the social role of symbolism. Cohen, for instance, says (1974: 4): "psychology can certainly shed light on the na- ture of the psychic 'origin' of symbolic action in general. It can contribute significantly towards the analysis of symbolic and artistic creativity and of the psychic experience which is induced by the performance of ceremonials and rituals. But the social significance of symbolic action can be dis- covered only when it is studied within the context of social relationships." The nature of these desired ends will obviously vary with the context in which the symbols are used and with the type of symbolic action engaged in. So, for example, in an act of communication the desired end will be simply to communicate an idea, while in an act of magic, for instance, the desired end will be to effect some actual change in the empirical world. It may be objected that the application of in- tentionality to the use of symbolic action may be Anthropos 87.1992 inappropriate. People may engage in many forms of symbolic action such as ritual not because of any internal state or expectations but because they are constrained to do so by their tradition or culture (cf. Radcliffe-Brown 1952: 123 ff.). Recognizing this addresses a problem of fundamental difference in the sociological realm and treating it here would entail going vastly beyond the framework of this essay. What we ought to bear in mind, is simp- ly that so-called intentionality need not be fully conscious to the actor, but may refer to a dimly perceived or even unconscious expectation. Symbols act on people. Symbolic action, by being able to alter the perceived relations between symbols and between the things they represent, is able to thereby change how the world is perceived, and so relations between people, between ideas, and between people and objects can actually be altered. This is because the perceived change in relations means that people will act and react differently to the relevant situations. This then also applies to relations of power. As Ivo Strecker (1988) has argued, the multi- levelled nature of symbols creates ambiguity and uncertainty which can be deliberately exploited to derive power. Subtle symbolic statements are effective because they cannot be openly countered, thus remain unchallenged, and then do their work cryptically. Through symbols relations of power may be institutionalized and made manifest and visible as Gohen has argued. Ceremonial displays of power, for instance, symbolic markers of status and power serve this function of marking relations of power without the need to continually renew and reassert them. "Social relations are developed and main- tained through symbolic forms and action" (Cohen 1974: 5). Symbolic manipulation is, therefore, an impor- tant device in the maintenance and change of relations of power. As various forms of relations between things, including relations of power, can be affected by symbolic manipulation then it is not surprising that the spiritual realm, which is by its very nature symbolic, is especially prone to this activity. Any change in symbolic representations may also entail for those concerned a change in their actual relations. Thus the adoption of the concept of God, of such significance in Western society, is a form of symbolic manipulation to address and alter rela- tionships of power existing between two societies.</page><page sequence="20">28 Erich Kolig 5. An Aboriginal "Sociology of Knowledge" If indeed the All-Father belief is a Christian de- rived concept, why is it so difficult to establish this fact? Why does it blend so inconspicuously into traditional Aboriginal religion as to create confu- sion among anthropologists? It seems as though this concept has been so carefully blended in with traditional forms of belief to obscure its origin. What I am suggesting here is that this is no coin- cidence, but is the outcome of a deliberate attempt to disguise the origin of this introduced concept and "dress it up" as an indigenous belief. Although I do not see this in terms of a conspiracy, as the sinister machination of powerhungry individuals, it is the result of conservative orthodoxy and vested interests at work. Aboriginal religion was in traditional Aborig- inal society an intellectual institution which en- compassed everything that could be known and understood about the world. It embodied the col- lective philosophies about people, world, meta- physics, and power; and outside it, at least official- ly, there was no knowledge or truth. Even though there was, as I have termed it, an underground knowledge, rivalling to some extent the official wisdom and dogma (see Kolig 1989: 106 f.), such enclaves of contradicting knowledge were both small and rare. When the process of Western con- tact challenged the Aboriginal view of the world, it was in a way which could be intellectually resisted but not ignored for any length of time. Previously, the evidence of religious and ritual power was ubiquitous in this society, as its continuance was seen as proof of the validity of their religious wis- dom and potency. With the advent of Europeans this was to change. It would become increasingly obvious that the power which was supposed to flow from their beliefs and rituals was ineffective in preventing their society from succumbing to the intrusion and changing beyond recognition. But why was this society so cautious to react and, linked with this question, why was the All-Fa- ther belief so carefully assimilated as if to disguise its Christian provenance? The primary institution in Aboriginal society was religion. It was, therefore, up to religion, we may surmise, to instigate some form of collective response to the forces unleashed by the presence of the Whites. And indeed, I have argued that religion did respond, after a brief period of traumatized inertia in the very beginning, in various forms (see Kolig 1989). But why did it not respond in a bold new way and why did it seek to disguise religious changes? The entire authority structure in this society was not only legitimized by religion but had its basis in the institution of religion per se. Through a system of inclusion-exclusion, one sector of society was placed in a position of indebtedness for bliss meted out by another section which was thereby placed in a position of dominance. It was in the system and dogmas of religion that relations of domination and subordination were elaborated, justified, and formalized (see Bern 1979). Given this intimate link of religion with author- ity and power, it follows that any drastic change to the doctrines of religion could constitute a serious challenge to the existing power structure. Vested interest, therefore, made for religious conserva- tism. The elaboration and perpetuation of doc- trines lay exactly with that sector of society which stood to gain from the status quo. Any possible rethinking of doctrines and a reinterpretation could only come from within this sector, as there was no tradition for renewal from the outside through charismatic innovation, externally inspired refor- mation, and the like. But exactly this social group had the least interest to revolutionize the religious system and thus perhaps undermine and jeopardize its dominant status. The unification of religious thought and power in one and the same hands creates a social and cultural conservatism which goes well beyond that of politically entrenched groups in other societies. Any blatant borrowing of Christian elements within the legitimate Aboriginal traditional frame- work would soon be recognized as such, if it were not disguised. The possibility of the admission of sources of legitimate religious authority outside the traditional religious system was not likely to be entertained by those in power who would have thus seriously undercut their own position. The dilemma Aboriginal society, or that sector entrusted with a leading role in an intellectual and political sense, faced was on the one hand a need for change, for reorientation to take in new realities, and to empower society at large vis-à-vis an intruding society and disruptive forces brought in the train of this intrusion, and on the other to maintain its position. It should not surprise that the intellectual circles in Aboriginal society exper- imented rather cautiously with religious innovation and, if changes were to be made, made sure they blended in well with the existing system. An abridged version of this paper was presented at a seminar at the Catholic University of Nijmegen in May 1990. To the chairman of the seminar, Dr. A. Borsboom, Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="21">Religious Power and the All-Father in the Sky 29 and the participants my sincere thanks. I was fortunate in being able to extend my studies, in particular with regard to Father Wilhelm Schmidt's work, while being Visiting Professor at the Institut für Völkerkunde at the University of Vienna during the Summer Semester of 1990. I am indebted for the invitation to Prof. K.R. Wernhart, Rektor of this University. Another brief ver- sion was presented in September of that year at the 15th Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions in Rome. Later this year a term as an Honorary Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Western Australia in Perth allowed me further library studies on this subject. After completion of my paper my attention was drawn by Dr. Tony Swain to his fine article (1990) in which he deals with the same subject. Despite some overlap between his paper and mine I did not think it necessary to alter either my argument or my presentation of it. Swain's paper is putting forward the view, quite in accord with mine, that the All-Father figure is a postcontact affair. He argues for the basic flexibility and adaptability of traditional Aboriginal religion and worldview which made it possible that within a short period of time after the advent of the Europeans innova- tive and syncretistic phenomena could arise. I basically pursue the same line of argument, although I do not share Swain's view that Aborigines reacted "with great, almost feverish speed to the new challenge." I think their response was somewhat more measured and cautious. However, there is a greater difference in the way Swain and I seek to provide a plausible explanation as to the specific purpose and reason for developing the particular piece of religious innovation. Swain argues that the introduction of a sky-based monotheism followed an intellectual necessity to take into account the destruction of locative site-kin religious traditions, while my paper places the accent somewhat differently on the search for a new power stratagem which was still based essentially on traditional assumptions about the sources of power needed to deal with everyday and political realities.

Er war eine herausragende Gestalt in der au- stralischen Social Anthropology. Seit fast 50 Jahren leistete er mit seiner Frau Catherine Pionierarbeit im ethnologischen Feld Australiens, vor allem durch seine hervorragenden Arbeiten über zahlreiche Gruppen von Aborigines, ihre soziale Organisation, ihre Kulte, ihre Kunst und besonders ihre traditionelle orale Literatur. Für diese Verdienste wurde das Ehepaar Berndt am Australia Day 1987 durch Aufnahme in den Order of Australia geehrt. Ronald Murray Berndt wurde am 14. Juli 1916 als Sohn einer australisch-französischen Hugenottin und eines deutschen Neu-Australiers in Adelaide, Südau- stralien geboren. Das Interesse des Vaters an fremden Kulturen fiel bei dem Sohn auf fruchtbaren Boden und weckte seine Begeisterung für die Völkerkunde, wozu nicht zuletzt zahlreiche Spaziergänge der beiden zum Südaustralischen Museum beitrugen. Diese Besu- che hatten ihn mit der materiellen Kultur der Aborigines bekannt gemacht, aber auch mit einigen Angehörigen des südaustralischen Narrinyeri-Stammes. Schon früh wurde ihm klar, daß er von den Menschen bei wei- tem mehr fasziniert war als von den Museumsobjekten. Nach seinem Schulabschluß ermutigte ihn sein Vater, eine Berufsausbildung zu beginnen. Er besuchte einen Kurs für Buchhaltung, der aber als einziges Ergebnis eine lebenslange Abneigung gegen Mathematik in ihm wachrief. So widmete er sich erneut der Völkerkunde, die er nun zielbewußter betrieb. Ende der 30er Jahre wurde er zum "Honorary Ethnologist" am Südaustrali- schen Museum ernannt. Norman B. Tindale und C. P. Mountford nahmen ihn unter ihre Fittiche. Er konnte wichtige Kontakte zu Aborigines aufnehmen. So kam 1939 seine erste „richtige" Feldarbeit bei den Narrinyeri von Murray Bridge zustande. Da er auch Angehörige anderer Gruppen traf, wurde ihm klar, daß er sie nicht Anthropos 87.1992 alle studieren konnte, sich auf einzelne beschränken mußte, was ihm keineswegs leicht fiel. Auf Einladung der University of Adelaide nahm er noch im selben Jahr an einer Expedition nach Ooldea in der Nullarbor-Ebene teil. Diese Unternehmung festigte seinen Entschluß, "an- thropological research" zu seiner Lebensaufgabe zu ma- chen. Dazu brauchte er eine professionelle Ausbildung, die er jedoch nur in Sydney bei Prof. A. P. Elkin bis zu einem akademischen Grad durchfuhren konnte. Seine Reise nach Sydney 1940 wurde wohl das wichtigste Ereignis für sein späteres Leben, denn er begann nicht nur seine Karriere, sondern traf am zweiten Studientage seine zukünftige Frau Catherine, eine Neuseeländerin, die ebenfalls Anthropology studieren wollte. 1941 heira- teten die beiden und bildeten von da an ein untrennbares Team im Leben wie in der Forschung. "The Berndts" wurden zu einem Markenzeichen. Ein kleines Stipendium machte ihnen eine erste ge- meinsame Feldarbeit möglich - in Ooldea. Ihre Ar- beitserfahrungen unter primitivsten Umständen waren eine gute Schulung für spätere Unternehmungen in noch entlegeneren Gebieten. Während ihres weiteren Studiums untersuchten sie die Beziehungen zwischen Aborigines und Europäern in Südaustralien und West- New South Wales, das erste "applied anthropology"- Projekt in Australien. 1944-46 arbeiteten die Berndts als Anthropologists und Welfare Officers bei der Aus- tralian Investment Agency im Northern Territory. Diese Firma, Eigentum des englischen Lords Vesty, umfaßte eine Anzahl großer Rinderzuchtstationen. Berichte über miserable Behandlung der einheimischen Cowboys und Landarbeiter waren an die Öffentlichkeit gedrungen. Ein Report der beiden Anthropologists sollte Klarheit über die Arbeitsbedingungen und das Leben der Aborigines in den Camps dieser Stationen bringen. Das gesammelte Material enthielt soviel sozialen Sprengstoff, daß es vertraulich behandelt wurde und über 40 Jahre unter Verschluß blieb, bis es 1987 unter dem Titel "The End of</page><page sequence="24">32 Miszellen an Era" erscheinen konnte. Nach dieser deprimierenden Erfahrung kehrten die Berndts zu wissenschaftlicher Arbeit im Rahmen des Departments of Anthropology an der Sydney University zurück. Doch Arnhemland und seine Menschen ließen sie nicht mehr los, und sie kehrten, so oft es ihre Mittel erlaubten, zu neuen Feldforschungen in dieses Gebiet zurück. Sie schlös- sen viele dauernde Freundschaften, die sich bis heute bewährt haben. Ronald M. Berndts berühmte Bücher "Kunapipi" (1951) und "Djangawul" (1952) erschienen zu dieser Zeit. Später folgten "An Adjustment Move- ment in Arnhemland" (1962), "Man, Land, and Myth in Northern Australia: The Guwinggu People" (1970) und "Love Songs of Arnhemland" (1976). Die offizielle akademische Laufbahn Ronald M. Berndts begann mit dem BA 1950 und dem MA with first class honours 1951. Um die Doktorwürde zu er- langen, entschlossen sich die Berndts zu Studien an der London School of Economics bei Raymond Firth. Da man sie mittlerweile fast nur als Australien-Spezialisten betrachtete, wählten sie Forschungen in den Eastern Highlands von Neuguinea zum Thema ihrer Doktor- arbeiten. Die hierzu unternommenen Feldforschungen (1951 und 1953) sollten die schwierigsten ihrer Lauf- bahn werden. Ronald M. Berndt erhielt den Ph. D. mit der Dissertation "Excess and Restraint". Ihren Rückweg von London nach Australien nahmen Ron und Catherine Berndt über die USA, was eine Carnegie Fellowship möglich machte. Sie trafen viele Anthropologen, die gar nicht dem Stil der ihnen ver- trauten "British School" entsprachen. Diese Erfahrungen spielten für Ronald M. Berndt eine wichtige Rolle beim späteren Aufbau seines eigenen Departments. Zunächst aber galt es, in Australien neu zu beginnen. Ronald M. Berndt entschloss sich, in Westaustralien Fuß zu fassen und ein Department ganz nach seinen eigenen Ideen zu begründen. 1956 wurden die ersten Lehrveranstaltungen im Rahmen des Department of Psychology angekün- digt. Die Studentenzahl wuchs von Jahr zu Jahr, bis 1959 auch "postgraduate studies" hinzugefügt werden konnten. Im selben Jahr erhielt Berndt seine Ernennung zum Reader und konnte 1960 Peter Lawrence als ersten angestellten Wissenschaftler gewinnen. 1961 wurde das Anthropology Centre zu einem selbständigen Depart- ment, und 1962 erhielt Berndt den Ruf als Gründungs- professor. Er blieb Head of Department bis kurz vor seinem Ruhestand. Über die Jahre wuchs die Zahl der Studenten erheblich an, und damit vergrößerte sich auch der Stab des Departments von 2 auf 16 vollbeschäftigte Mitglieder 1978. 1981 trat Ronald M. Berndt in den Ruhestand und wurde zum Emeritus ernannt, was in Australien keine Routine ist. Befreit von der Last der Verwaltung widmete er sich seinen Forschungen. Akademische Karriere und Lehre waren eine wichti- ge Komponente in Ronald Berndts Leben, doch Feldfor- schung mit dem engen Kontakt zu anderen Menschen, den Möglichkeiten, das Wesen und den Reichtum frem- der Kulturen zu erfassen, war das Hauptanliegen für ihn. Mit seiner Frau Catherine besuchte er neben Südaustra- lien und dem Northern Territory auch die westliche Wü- ste und auf kürzeren Trips Nordwest-Australien. Bände über Bände von Feldnotizen sammelten sich an. Da er ein ebenso begeisterter und disziplinierter Schriftsteller wie Feldforscher war, gab er sein Wissen in zahlreichen Veröffentlichungen weiter. "The World of the First Aus- tralians", das er zusammen mit Catherine schrieb, wurde ein Klassiker, der in zahlreichen Auflagen erschien. Von seinen vielen Arbeiten über die Kunst der Aborigines sei nur genannt: "Aboriginal Australian Art. A Visual Per- spective" (1982 zusammen mit Catherine B. und John E. Stanton). Sein Interesse an der Kunst und seine Sammel- leidenschaft, die er schon als Kind bewies, führten zu einer hervorragenden Kollektion von traditioneller und moderner Kunst der Aborigines, die den Grundstock für das Anthropology Research Museum an der Universität von Westaustralien bildete. Ronald M. Berndts große Liebe gehörte jedoch immer den oralen Überlieferun- gen der Aborigines. Zwei umfangreiche Penguin-Bände, die er mit seiner Frau zusammenstellte, sollten einen Einblick in die Reichhaltigkeit dieser Literatur geben. 1988 erschien "The Speaking Land. Myth and Story in Aboriginal Australia". "The Singing Land", für das Berndt noch seine Kapitel vollenden konnte, wird post- hum erscheinen. Ein dritter Aspekt im Leben Ronald Berndts war sein politisches Engagement für die Belange der Aborigines. Er gehörte zahlreichen Gremien an, wovon besonders das Institute of Aboriginal Studies zu nennen ist, zu des- sen Begründern er zählt. Er war Mitglied des Aboriginal Art Board of the Australia Council, des State (W. A.) Advisory Council on Aboriginal Affairs, des Aboriginal Advancement Council (W. A.) und der Gründerpräsident der Anthropological Society of Western Australia. Alle diese Institutionen profitierten von seinem Wissen und seiner Erfahrung, denn er kannte die Menschen, von denen er sprach, genau. Er war gewiß kein bequemer Mann, wenn er etwas durchsetzen wollte, doch auch er konnte die Sterne nicht vom Himmel holen für die Aborigines. Die Widerstände, die es zu überwinden gilt, um echte Verbesserungen im Dasein der Aborigines zu bewirken, sind sehr zäh. Es sieht so aus, als sei das Leben Ronald Berndts voll ausgefüllt gewesen durch seine Wissenschaft, die er als Berufung empfand. Doch liebte er gastliche Geselligkeit, interessante Gespräche bei einem guten Wein und einem Mahl, oder auch nur bei einer Tasse Tee. Mit Hingabe grub und pflanzte er in seinem Garten. Er freute sich über eine gutgeratene Süßkartoffel genauso wie über eine hübsche Rose. Eine besondere Würze seines Lebens war sein Interesse an indischer und tibetischer Kultur. Mehrere Reisen hatten ihn in diese Länder geführt. Viele Wissenschaftler aus der ganzen Welt hatten Kontakt zu Ronald M. Berndt, so verlor nicht nur die australische, sondern auch die internationale Anthropol- ogy/Ethnologie einen hervorragenden Vertreter. Seine Arbeiten haben einen entscheidenden Anteil an unserem Wissen über die Kultur der australischen Aborigines und damit über die Kulturen der Welt.
