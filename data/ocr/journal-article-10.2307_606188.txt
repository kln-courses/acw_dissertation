<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books in respect to positions of animals and human figures in narra- tive representation. The basic outline is contained in an intro- ductory chapter on problems of interpretation. This is followed by the interpretations themselves; a lengthy study of the Palette of Nar'mer; and, finally, an appendix addressed to principles of narratological research. The title of the book refers to a limited part of this complex study. Reduced to the simplest terms, Davis contends that predatory animals are unseen by their prey, and that human hunters or warriors are unseen by their enemies. Blows remain potential or disguised. When this principle is applied to the Palette of Nar'mer, so that Nar'mer's mace-wielding stance on the reverse translates into a blow on the saucer-and thus on the viewer-on the ob- verse, several assumptions require validation. Davis assumes that the larger palettes, including the Hunter's Palette, the Ox- ford Palette, and the Palette of Nar'mer, were held by the viewer and turned over and over like the pages of a book so that the nar- rative on one side provides the key to interpreting the continued narrative on the opposite side. On the Oxford Palette and the Pal- ette of Nar'mer, part of the action is perceived as taking place between the sides of the objects, that is, within the thicknesses of the palettes themselves, in unseen but nonetheless dimen- sional space. A second assumption is that the viewer can and should read the narrative. Apart from the physical difficulty of flipping the palettes over, actually or even metaphorically, it is unlikely that an ancient viewer and a contemporary art historian share the same kinds of sophistication. To us, the "serpopards" on the Oxford Palette perform an obscure act as they lick a horned animal. The ancient Egyptian, on the other hand, might imme- diately recognize magical spells in which licking would be either helpful or harmful, for such spells must have existed long before they were written into the Pyramid Texts. A final assumption of Davis is that narration implies spatial and probably temporal passage from one activity to the next. Davis attempts to prove this point through careful textual analysis. But in pharaonic art, objects within a composition have reference only to each other, not to a viewer, and exist in a kind of continuous present. That Davis' non-canonical art of prehistory was conceived in radically different terms is a puz- zling concept, difficult to follow. Many of Davis' observations are commonsensical and needed to be said. Still others are remarkably acute. His analy- sis of how the artisan worked in carving the Palette of Nar'mer is particularly instructive. There are a few minor quibbles. The selection of Naqada II painted pottery, used also in his earlier book, Canonical Tradi- tions in Ancient Egyptian Art, is ill-chosen. The drawing on p. 47, figure 7, represents a pot purchased in Egypt by W. M. Flinders Petrie and subsequently labeled by him "fake." In fact, the pot is ancient but the painting modern. The pot in figure 6 may be an- other such example. The boat standard comprising double oval lines is unknown in prehistoric painting, and the row of female peg figures seems to have wandered in from the Gebelein linen. The left-hand figure appears uncharacteristically to touch the head of the next in line. Alternatively, the linear appendage is not an arm but a device worn by the second figure. It scarcely mat- ters, since neither the gesture nor the hairstyle existed in prehis- toric art. On p. 86, final line, the word "its" is wrongly omitted before "own death." The relationship of man to nature, which Davis begins to explore with persuasive authority, is an important subject de- serving further study. ELIZABETH FINKENSTAEDT UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY The Formation of Nabatean Art: Prohibition of a Graven Im- age Among the Nabateans. By JOSEPH PATRICHE. Jerusalem: MAGNES PRESS, THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY; Leiden: E. J. BRILL, 1990. Pp. 231. This slender volume is a thorough, well-documented, rich study of Nabatean art viewed against the background of con- flicting native and foreign cultural forces which influenced it. The three central thrusts of the book are: 1) an attempt to pro- vide a unifying, aniconic principle which, for the author, is the single most important characteristic of Nabatean art (p. 165 and throughout); 2) a serious attempt to define the cultural borders of Nabatea (pp. 40ff.), to provide a framework for in- telligent discussion of the characteristics of Nabatean art; and 3) a successful attempt to distinguish between native strains and those which reflect Hellenistic-Roman impact. The book consists of four chapters. The first, "An Introduc- tion to the Nabateans and Their Art," provides us with an up- to-date historical and archaeological survey of the Nabateans, a discussion of their ethnic composition, a summary of Na- batean art beginning with Strabo's testimony, the history of the author's research, a comparison of the art of the Hauran and that of the Nabateans, and a "classification of the figura- tive representations in Nabatean art." Chapter two, "Representations of the Gods Among the Na- bateans," has nine subheadings, including sections on the lit- erary sources and epigraphic evidence and discussions of the gods as represented in various media: steles, coins, and clay figurines. In this chapter the manner of representation of the gods is the overriding concern and organizing principle, while the discussions of the gods represented in various media are intended to present the material in a more controlled fashion. Chapter three, "Nabatean Art," includes discussion of ancil- lary art forms: rock-carved facades, capitals, painted pottery, oil lamps, coins, jewelry, and figurative architectural ornamenta- tion in which the aniconic principle dominated. The chapter 665</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) concludes with a discussion of Nabatean iconoclasm, rock draw- ings (petroglyphs), and the significance of the non-figurative trend in Nabatean art. The final chapter, "Nabatean Art and Other Oriental Cul- ture," is an attempt to place Nabatean art in its general cul- tural milieu and discusses the worship of betyls and stelae beyond Nabatea, the Nabateans and the Jews, and Nabatea and Arabia. Though the book is an important contribution to Nabatean studies, there are several issues of concern. Patriche focuses on the aniconic character of Nabatean art, particularly in its reli- gious and funerary aspects and on its tendency to represent gods in the form of a stele, yet he fails to isolate the Nabatean moti- vation for adopting an aniconic approach to art. While he dis- cusses this point cursorily in different places (pp. 19, 20, 39, 152, 166), the discussions are inconclusive as well as scattered. Secondly, on occasion the author raises interesting points yet fails to follow through or to draw implications from the data. For example, Patriche fails to develop his observation that Na- batean pottery found in Moabite, Edomite, and northern Sinai sites, and in the Negev, is not found in excavations of Nabatean Si'a (p. 45), and that, as opposed to Petra, where figurative art was found on architectural ornaments, none was found at Madacin Saleh, er-Ramm, or at the Nabatean sites in the Negev (pp. 151, 152). Some discussions requiring conclusions lack them (see p. 60, end of paragraph one). His writing is occasion- ally unclear (p. 61, beginning of paragraph two) and, in other instances, contradictory. On p. 64, his statement that "the orien- tation of the stelae varies from place to place, and no one orien- tation dominates" contradicts the following sentence that "... there is a definite system of orientation that has proven to be valid for more than 95 percent of the stelae . . ." Moreover, he should have exercised more restraint. Rather than categorically stating that the Nabateans abstained from using images (p. 19 and elsewhere), he should have said that they had a bias toward non-figurative art, but that exceptions exist, such as stone anthropomorphic statuary on the temple to the Nabatean god Dusares, on the main temple at Petra, and the temple to the goddess al-Uzza (pp. 142, 143). Since he makes categorical claims for an aniconic Nabatean art, one wonders about the numerous exceptions. Indeed, in his zeal to defend the notion that the art is aniconic, he argues in a circu- lar fashion: since the numerous anthropomorphic and horse terra-cotta figurines are iconic, they cannot represent gods. However, organization is the most serious flaw of the book. Since chapter two is devoted to representation of the gods and chapter three to other media wherein the gods are not repre- sented, why put the discussion of Nabatean iconoclasm in the second chapter (pp. 153-57)? Likewise, if, as he argues, the human and animal terra-cotta figurines do not represent gods, why discuss them in chapter two? Though there is a certain logic in his apparent haphazard juxtaposition of topics, that juxtaposition is jarring. For example, in his section on "Clas- sification of the Figurative Representations in Nabatean Art" (pp. 48-49), he devotes almost half the space to a discussion of non-figurative art. Furthermore, Patriche's text and arguments could have been improved by gathering all relevant discussion about specific is- sues, such as his central thesis, in one section, perhaps even a chapter where he could have summarized the main points of his thesis, the aniconic character of Nabatean art, adduced the rele- vant evidence, and successfully responded to problems such as the numerous exceptions to the aniconic tendency. Because of inadequate attention to organization many of the author's excel- lent points are lost. His judgments differ at various points. In one of his discussions of the coins, he correctly notes that while the city gods are anthropomorphic, a stele is used to depict the Nabatean god Dusares (p. 70); though figurative art is found in some temples, the actual objects of veneration are non- figurative (p. 173); and though figurative rock drawings depict humans and human animals, these are not deities (p. 160). Moreover, he argues that the vast majority of examples of figu- rative art at Petra and elsewhere in Nabatea can be described as actually of Hellenistic-Roman impact and imitation. In a more technical vein, the illustrations are occasionally poor, and do not clearly support the point made in the text (e.g., p. 58 and ills. 10, 11). Finally, a reference map locating the sites discussed in the text would have been helpful. Nevertheless, the individual discussions demonstrate a com- mand of the vast literature and monuments, and Patriche's posi- tions are generally well argued and well documented. The book is therefore a very important contribution to a much-neglected area and period in the art and archaeology of Palestine and Jor- dan. It shows how art can contribute to a richer understanding of the cultural values of a society. It also prods the reader to pay attention to easily overlooked details. Finally, it serves as a model for caution in approaching the study of art from a re- gional perspective.
