The Chiloango sculptures were all minkisi of the type usually called nkondi, heavily nailed anthropomorphic figures. Nkisi (the singular) is the term in the Kongo language for complexes of material objects and ritual procedures intended to benefit clients of the owner-operator, the nganga (pi. banganga), by identifying and punishing wrongdoers supposed to have caused misfortunes, sickness, and death, or by providing benefits such as fertility of crops and women. Minkisi, great and small, owed their importance and effectiveness to the stories of origin that attended them, and to their distinctive appearance. In theory a nkisi was revealed exclusively to the man (occasionally a woman) who became its original owner-operator (ngudi a nganga), its name and the story of its origin serving to distinguish it from other minkisi. In practice, some names recur over considerable distances of time and space, attached to minkisi of dissimilar appearance and function. The most aggressive minkisi were called mbau on the coast and nkondi in the interior. Mbau (pi. zimbau) denotes the nails, spikes, and wedges that are driven into such figures.2 Nkondi (pi. minkondi or zinkondi), like mbau, is a term of convenience rather than a definite class. Between the collapse of the Loango kingdom in 1870 and the Portuguese appropriation of Cabinda in 1885, the maintenance of a degree of law and order depended heavily on the operations of three particularly famous minkondi: Mangaaka, Mabyala Mandembe, and 1.

Several of the minkisi grouped by Bassani are known to have been examples of Mangaaka, and the presumption is that all were, given their similarity. There were other "Mangaaka" that did not belong, stylistically, to this group. The sculptural styles of several coastal minkisi known to share the name and aggressive functions of Mabyala Mandembe are very different from each other; moreover, although Mabyala was famous on the coast as a guarantor of treaties and reconciliations, inland, in eastern Mayombe, the name appears as that of a minor nkisi for divination. Evidently, even on the coast, a number of sculptors produced blanks for various Mabyala and their banganga, whose relations to each other will remain unknown.3 As we will see, the same diversity characterizes Mavungu. This paper seeks to explain an apparent contradiction. Basing themselves on indigenous statements, scholars including myself have said that if a nkisi was to be based on a wooden figure, the nganga to whom the composition and operation of this nkisi had been revealed commissioned a sculptor to make a blank (indubi) of appropriate form, which the nganga then transformed into a nkisi by adding medicines (bilongo) and other attributes to furnish it with its particular powers.4 The owner might in turn train apprentices (baana ba nganga). Yet in the case of Mangaaka both the sculptures and their attributes are all much the same, suggesting the products of teamwork, as Bassani points out. Why would "the Chiloango workshop" be mass producing Mangaaka and for whom? The answer to this question invites a new look at the aesthetics of nailing and of form in minkisi. The same problem of serial production arises with respect to Mabyala Mandembe, which the trader R. E. Dennett said was produced in Kakongo, on the coast 3. A beautiful "Wife of Mabyala" in Leiden (present address of husband unknown) is clearly a Chiloango product, entirely different in style from the Kakongo Mabyala Mandembe.

Robert Visser collected a Mabyala now in the Grassi Museum für Völkerkunde, Leipzig. The heavily nailed figure featured a knotted fiber bundle hanging from its upraised hand, which held a knife. On the belly of the figure were two rectangular medicine packs outlined in white and faced by mirrors. Below them an object that might be a cup hung from a sort of apron. On top of its head the figure had a sort of headdress, a wild collection of feathers. These details are to be gathered from Visser's photograph of the piece, made into a souvenir postcard sold on the coast; captioned, "Le grand Fetish Mabialla Mandembe," the image is a relatively rare example of a nkisi almost "as collected."5 The nkisi itself, now in Leipzig, has lost the headdress, the knife, the fiber bundle, and the "cup"; its legs are wrapped in blue baft (a coarse cotton cloth made in Britain for the African trade) and it still has its apron (fig. 1). All these details help to identify the group of minkisi to which this one belongs, of which I have been able to identify nine members, along with a painting of one more by Eduard Pechuël-Loesche (see below). The distinctive features of the group are the double mirror and a curiously appealing face with open mouth. Other minkisi have open mouths, sometimes showing teeth or a tongue, but this face is, I believe, recognizable as the work of a particular sculptor; it also appears in other minkisi, unnamed, that have only a single mirror.6 With two exceptions known to me, the double belly pack occurs only with this face. The exceptions, having nothing else in common with Visser's Mabyala, are a Mabyala obviously by a different hand, and an anonymous nkondi also collected by Visser.7 My hypothesis, which could be tested by inspecting more of the minkisi in question, is that in addition to the distinctive face and the double belly pack, the Mabyala of this group all had among their attributes a knife, an occipital hole for "medicines," a "crown" of feathers surmounting the bald head, a ball of fibers, a bell on a chain, and an apron in front of which hung an object that may have been a cup for administering 5.

Some of the attributes on the list are missing from figures now in museums, as the table shows. This Mabyala group indicates a second production team similar to the one posited by Bassani, and raises the same challenge to the conventional idea of a nkisi as the unique product of the operations of a single nganga, performed over time on a sculpted body provided by a carver. Evidence of the identity of the group comes from study of the individuals. The generally bald head of Mabyala is an unusual feature, because the head is a favored location for medications, often a whole array of aggressive teeth, "guns," and spikes, embedded in a pack mounted on a stub carved to support it. In Mabyala the cranial medicines were contained in a cavity, the figure's "fontanelle." On the bald head the crown of feathers formed a sort of fence around the medicated hole and a fixing nail (on which more to follow). Exactly this arrangement is also found in a war nkisi collected by Visser.9 Because museums do not usually take aerial photographs of their possessions, it is difficult to be sure from a photograph whether the occipital hole is present, but in the catalogue picture of a Mabyala in Coimbra, Portugal, a wisp of white cotton can be seen on top of the head, indicating a similar cavity.10 The upper mirror of this nkisi appears to be a reconstruction, but it carries the round fiber bundle. The figure wears baft trousers, though they are not blue, and the medicine pack now missing from the back has left a space shaped like that on the back of both the Mabyala in Leipzig and the one in Tervuren.11 A nkisi that appears to be Mabyala is shown as the frontispiece of Dennett's book, although he says it is Mavungu. It is now in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford.12 Once again, a comparison of the nkisi in its present state with an old photograph is informative. It has the 8.

At some point, presumably after the object's arrival in England, its hand and face were painted blue, its lips bright red, and its legs brown, apparently to make its appearance more grotesque. On the top of the head as it now is, however, we see a large nail and a cylinder or tube stuck in, neither of them visible in the original photograph. The fixing nail is probably authentic, and the cylinder marks the medicinal hole for us. Dennett did not own the Pitt Rivers "Mavungu"; he borrowed it to photograph for his book, just as he attempted, unsuccessfully, to borrow a Mangaaka. After a Portuguese government round-up of minkisi in the early 1890s, "Secretary 11lus™ Senr. José Chichorro" gave it to the traveler Mary Kingsley, who subsequently gave it to the Pitt Rivers.13 Dennett says it had lost the trousers of blue baft that it once wore, a garment we have already noted in the Leipzig figure. I believe that he was mistaken in calling this nkisi Mavungu, for reasons that will now appear. The observations of the naturalist Eduard Pechuël Loesche concerning Mabyala provide the earliest 13.

He made a watercolor painting of Mabyala that appears in the recently published edition of his diary.14 An engraving based on the watercolor appears as an epigraph for the chapter in his Volkskunde von Loango in which he describes the making and eventual fate of a Mabyala (fig. 2).15 The painting shows the characteristic face, the double mirror, and a "shawl" of nails, nearly all of the same kind, suggesting that they were inserted at the same time. Pechuël-Loesche's testimony and that of Visser as to the correct name of the open-mouthed, nailed nkisi with the double mirrors, Mabyala, seem to outweigh that of Dennett. The watercolor shows the nkisi wearing a headdress of the red tail feathers of the gray parrot; the panache above the headdress seems to be planted in an occipital hole.16 The legs of the sculpture 14.

This cup is clearly present in a Mabyala (one of two) at Coimbra in Portugal, attached by a chain to the apron, from which it could presumably be detached for use; this Coimbra Mabyala appears to be the most complete of those now in museums, the closest to what the original may have MacGaffey and Harris (see note 3), fig. 16. In Central Africa the gray parrot is believed to reveal secrets and is therefore associated with divination. The headdress is called nsala mpongo. been like (fig. 3). A similar cup, on a chain, hangs from the arm of the Mabyala in Berg en Dal;17 the remains of the apron are hooked below the belly packs. Like the Mabyala inTervuren, the Mabyala in Faro, Portugal, carries a single clapperless bell on a chain; the belly packs on this figure have disintegrated, revealing that they were mounted over square-cut holes.18 The prominent nail in the skull of the Pitt Rivers Mabyala, misnamed "Mavungu," is there to "fix" the medicines in the cavity; the Faro Mabyala carries a similar nail. Lehuard and others are mistaken in supposing that every nailed nkisi, even one with just a single nail, is nkondi. A lone fixing nail, larger than others in its vicinity, can often be seen at the twelve o'clock position above the belly pack; sometimes the difference in function is made clear by the use of a screw instead of a nail.19 Such nails serve to "fix" the medicines; the verb koma, "to nail," also means "to arouse, to activate." Mabyala, like Mavungu and Mangaaka, was much in demand to manage disputes and crime on the Loango coast after 1870. All this activity was profitable for the owners of these minkisi, who charged money not only for the invocation and nailing of the device but for removing the nail and lifting the curse. For example, R. Cobden Phillips, who traded on the Congo River for sixteen years at the end of the nineteenth century, tells how a certain man dismissed his wife and took up with a younger woman. The wife had a fetish nailed so that her rival should not marry her ex-husband, but the elders decided she was in the wrong and obliged her to pay to have the nail withdrawn. "This cost her £10, at a moderate computation, as the fetish-man could ask his own terms in the matter."20 A. M. Lutangu, a Christian convert writing in Kikongo for the missionary K. E. Laman in 1915, explained that chiefs liked to have a major nkisi because it would attract clients from other villages, and the whole clan would benefit from the fees in goats or 17.

In his diary entry for July 9, 1875, he tells us that, hoping to recover a large quantity of gunpowder stolen by two employees, he enlisted the help of his friend Phillips, the trader, to have "the powerful theft-fetish" (mächtigsten Diebes-Fetisch) Mabyala Mandembe sent from Loango.22 The arrival of the fetish created great alarm in the neighborhood, and crowds came to watch; it was said to drive thieves mad. Four days later, the owner (Besitzer) of the nkisi, who brought it but was apparently not its operator, summoned the local banganga. At ten in the morning the ngudi a nganga arrived with his assistants; drums and other instruments sounded and the ritual began. The essence of it was an ordeal in which the accused were required to eat pieces of manioc that had been stuffed into the open mouth of the nkisi- the innocent would vomit, the guilty would swell up and die. In the course of the proceedings, the ngudi a nganga took off the fetish's parrot-feather headdress before striking its head and then his own forehead three times with the flat of his hand in order to identify himself with Mabyala. He then paraded in a grand costume, wearing the same headdress, and obliged the accused persons, in turn, to approach the fetish in a prescribed manner; each was to take from its mouth a piece of manioc, smeared with tukula (red camwood powder) and marked with a black circle, which he was to swallow whole, followed by a large amount of water. Meanwhile the nganga danced, brandishing an old French saber, banging it on the ground in front of the fetish, and uttering curses. Despite these efforts, nothing happened; by late afternoon the nganga was assuring Pechuël-Loesche that the accused would surely swell up overnight and die in a couple of days. But though the accused admitted the theft from the start, they refused to say where they had disposed of the loot. The exercise was a failure. Pechuël-Loesche was reduced to warning the local headmen that nails had been driven into Mabyala, which would surely kill the holder of any of the missing gunpowder. His account explains the open mouth of the nkisi and the use made in 21. P. Geary, "Sacred Commodities: The Circulation of Medieval Relics," in The Social Life of Things, ed. A. Appadurai (Cambridge, 1986), pp. 169-191. On Lutangu's writings, see MacGaffey (see note 20), pp. 35-37. 22. See Pechuël-Loesche (see note 14), pp. 179 and 184-187 for the full narrative. the ritual of the bald head and the parrot-feather crown. No nailing occurred, although Pechuël-Loesche indicates that the nganga could also have made use of the nkasa poison ordeal and the nailing procedure.23 In his expedition report Pechuël-Loesche tells us that the nganga who created the original Mabyala, or at least the Mabyala with which we are concerned, was so successful that other men sought a share in the enterprise. He obliged them not only by training them in the medicines and performance routines but also by providing them with copies ("children") of the nkisi, on the condition that they operate them only in their own villages (daheim) and thus, in effect, sign a non compete clause with respect to his own more lucrative traveling business. This franchising explains the existence of multiple copies of Mabyala and presumably also of Mangaaka; the copies were imbued with some of the aura of the original and would do for local purposes.24 Pechuël-Loesche then tells us that while the originating nganga was crossing a river in response to a demand from the king for his services, the original Mabyala (the Urfetisch), weighted with nails, fell in the water, irretrievably. Its owner was forced to promote one of the copies (fig. 3).25 If art historians had been less preoccupied with attributing sculptures to the Kongo "sub-tribes" supposed to have produced them, they would surely have noticed other signs of the work of particular hands, although only the most successful, money-making minkisi would have been franchised. Its notoriety would suggest that Mavungu was one such, but evidence is lacking.26 Two formidable nkondi, both from Mayombe and both labeled Mavungu, are very different from each other and from the Mabyala we have been considering.27 The only other "Mavungu" known to me, in the Minneapolis 23. Banging on the ground took the place of nailing to "awaken" the fetish. After the failed ritual, Phillips took the thieves away in chains; he later wrote that one of them had fallen ill and confessed what happened to the gunpowder! 24. Zoë Strother tells me that the Pende practiced a similar "franchising," but of masks (I thank Professor Strother for her advice while this paper was being written). All over Central Africa, dances and cultic practices, some of which included proprietary images, were similarly franchised. 25. Pechuël-Loesche (see note 15), pp. 380-381. 26. No good description of Mavungu at work exists; the subheading of Dennett's "Religion of the Fjort" (see note 13) is "Mavungu," but he has nothing useful to say about it. 27. K. E.

The appearance of a Mavungu that Richard Burton saw at Noki on the south bank of the Congo in 1875 resembles an anonymous nkondi now in the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution: bowler hat, large belly pack with mirror, open mouth, and abundant attachments.28 28. R. F. Burton, Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo (London, 1876), vol. 2, p. 219; MacGaffey and Harris (see note 3), fig. 64a. The bowler or "billycock" hat, popular with sailors, was devised by London hat makers in 1849. Nails could be hammered into nkondi such as Mabyala to provoke it into taking action. The procedure was called koma nloko, translatable as "hammering a curse," although the nkisi could also be provoked by insulting it, exploding gunpowder next to it, banging on the ground in front of it, even by making obscene references to its mother-in-law. Nails in the chest of the figure could cause the target of the curse to experience the characteristic chest pains of lubanzi, "the disease of the ribs," but it is evident from the figures themselves that nails could be driven into every available space without regard to anatomical specificity. Besides punishing offenders, nkondi could sanction treaties; Lehuard, relying only on travelers' reports, doubts that this was in fact the function of nkondi, which he thinks provide only "strengthening magic." Misunderstanding a description by the missionary ethnographer Bittremieux of Mabyala Mandembe in use, he asks: "Why are these nails said to be curses if they are commemorating a reconciliation?"29 In fact, the parties to an agreement swore oaths on the nkisi, which was then expected to punish any violator. Owners might require slaves to swear on a nkisi that they would not abscond, and a person who felt he was in danger of being enslaved might invoke the protection of a nkisi in the same way that he might "insult" a chief whom he wished to secure as a patron.30 Eyewitnesses assure us that the bodies of minkondi were progressively covered with metal in the course of use, each nail bearing mute witness to a violently passionate event. Pechuël-Loesche, like Phillips, is among the authorities who say that once the punishment had been inflicted the nail would be withdrawn. Scholars have debated the point, but it appears that practice varied from place to place or perhaps from nkisi to nkisi. Lehuard shows a nkondi eaten away almost to nothing by nailing, but notes that this is one of the rare examples to show evidence of regular removal.31 Moreover, visual evidence suggests that, for at least some kinds of nkondi, nails were inserted as part of the composition before the 29.

Lehuard argues convincingly that the hardware driven into the most spectacular nkondi is an intrinsic element: The nails are not planted randomly. They follow a rigorous distribution, giving the impression that the artist willed this regularity, this equilibrium, this marriage of wood and iron. Without their cladding these statues would be, to our eyes, incomplete. And although we may well say that it is the bilongo [medicines], sealed under a resinous paste, that give the object its force, one cannot help thinking that nkondi that were collected before they were "completed" stand there naked and clumsy.32 Lehuard goes on to quote a Kongolese who told the missionary Struyf, "the more nails, the more beautiful the nkisi."33 "Beautiful" is probably not the right translation of the Kongo idea; zimbau were impressive, causing "astonishment" (ngitukulu), but above all frightening (.nkadulu a nsisi). As Pechuël-Loesche noticed, they owed their effectiveness as regulators to the fear they aroused, which was due in part to their visual impact as nailed figures, even though in his own experiment no nailing occurred. This is action sculpture. Blades driven into an anthropomorphic figure make us wince, inescapably calling up the action, even though we did not see it or. hear the invocation: "Lunkanka, wake up! Drive a knife into his chest, make his nose bleed, wring his neck, make his heart pound, may he cough incessantly."34 In a context of entirely different beliefs, missionaries were frightened too, burning minkisi as works of the Devil.35 It is hard to imagine a nail-less nkondi, "standing there naked and clumsy" the first time it was called upon to deal with theft or witchcraft. The evidence that not only an arrangement of nails but other accessories as well (beard, skirt, belly pack with cowrie) were included as part of the original design is most evident in minkisi that are copies. If we return now to Bassani's Mangaaka and focus on their armature of added features, we observe that, despite their imperfect condition today, the armatures are more uniform than the sculptures to which they are attached. The added features include a resin beard filled with medicines, supported on iron stays and generously fringed with goat hair; a round belly pack fronted by a large cowrie, rather than the usual mirror; and a "skirt" of folded raffia cloths hung over a belt.

It is striking that both Mabyala and Mangaaka have relatively few of the added elements, besides nails, that testify to successive individual invocations: additional pieces of rag, small extra minkisi, miniature rat-traps "to catch ghosts and witches," packets of materials to remind the nkisi of the task assigned to it, and so on.36 The Mangaaka sculptures usually have delicately carved caps; glaring eyes made of ceramic material; nsunga protective woven bracelets on the upper arms; and, instead of an upraised arm, hands on hips in the aggressive pose called vonganana, which imitates an angry chicken. The glaring eyes and the pose suggest an inner, motivated personality whose capacities are otherwise described only by the semantic connotations of the "medicines" secreted in the beard and the belly pack. But it is hard to believe that the exceptionally aggressive versions of Mangaaka now in the Pigorini Museum (Rome),37 the Field Museum (Chicago),38 the Detroit Institute of Arts,39 and the one recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art40 were produced by the same hand as the relatively sedate, squat figures in the Linden Museum (Stuttgart),41 Wereldmuseum (Rotterdam),42 and Rijksmuseum Volkenkunde (Leiden).43 It seems that more than one sculptor was at work in the Chiloango atelier to provide blanks for franchised copies of Mangaaka. The caps of the more aggressive figures are more extensively carved than the others, and the artist responsible for them had clearly been studying European "picture papers," which were available in Loango at this time for sculptors to pin up on their walls.44 Evidence 36. A nkondi in the Sociedade de Geografia, Lisbon, is clearly a "knock-off" of Mangaaka, having some of the distinctive features but singularly failing to achieve a comparable artistic impact.

The effort to suggest powerful musculature contrasts sharply with almost all other large Kongo sculptures, in which the form of the back rarely departs far from the tree trunk it was made of. Other sculptors in the past had produced copies of St. Anthony figures (Toni Malau), imitating the folds of the saint's robe; in Mangaaka, however, the sculptor's intent was not to copy but to harness a visual effect to a new purpose, producing a hybrid of extraordinary vigor. Interest in the aesthetics of form has often been missing from scholarly studies of African art, which instead concentrate on meaning and function. Susan Vogel writes, "Recent publications tend to concentrate on the growing body of information about the function and significance of African art and limit remarks about form to praiseful descriptions."45 Since Vogel's comment, scholarship has not done much to remedy the problem she identified. Patrick McNaughton remarks that collectors and curators have done much better in this regard.46 Many collectors say things like, "Owning this piece has changed my life," while they remain indifferent to its ethnographic context. A review of exhibition catalogues will show, however, that it is above all sculptural 1orm that they value, even though they no longer limit themselves to "realistic" sculptures, or strip them of added material or wax them like furniture.47 Most minkisi have lost some or even all of the extra sculptural elements that were essential to their original function, but our aesthetic judgment should respect the totality of a work, even when it is a diminished totality. For Michèle Coquet—writing about the fetishes of the Bwabo in Burkina Faso but with reference to Kongo nkondi also—the "fetish style," the "aesthetic of the fetish," depends on the ensemble of accumulated elements, which gain new meaning by their incomplete incorporation with others in a new form, as in certain collages by Picasso in which a piece of newspaper is no longer just a piece of newspaper. This was surely also the case in the view of the original public for a major 45. S. Vogel, Closeup: Lessons in the Art of Seeing African Sculpture (New York: Center for African Art, 1990), p. 7. 46.

For each element one could tell a story about its meaning: white chalk (luvemba) might be included, "that the eyes of the nkisi should be clear," but in its new context the chalk entered into a play of difference with other materials. Coquet argues that concentration on ethnographic information and on decoding meanings tends to bypass the form of the object, which remains autonomous, partly independent of context, and thus capable of being appropriated into other contexts and subject to new interpretations.48 Collectors on the coast in the 1890s were impressed by appearances, competing for the best ones while despising what they thought were the functions of their trophies and ignoring local interpretations. The copied armatures of franchised Mabyala and Mangaaka suggest that their original public also responded to the visual effect of these particular accumulations. Coquet's analysis is very much to the point but remains static. A great nkisi, especially of the kind formerly known as nail fetishes, was and still is an entity in four dimensions. In its original place and time of use, the public knew that it had come into existence as an extraordinary revelation to a particular individual whom it instructed as to the form of the nkisi, the medicinal content, and the activating rules and procedures. There followed a complex and bloody process of composition by which, or so it was believed, the souls of victims were imprisoned in it to provide its energy. Oaths sworn on the nkisi imposed obligations and sanctioned treaties; the collective memory of the community it served also registered the punishments it had inflicted and the benefits attributed to it. All this frightened Pechuël Loesche's neighbors before they even set eyes on Mabyala. As Alfred Gell explains, an instructed person would not see in such a fetish a mere form: "what is seen is the visible knot which ties together an invisible skein of relations, fanning out into social space and social time . . . these relations have produced this particular thing in its concrete, factual presence; and it is because these relations exist(ed) that the fetish can exercise its judicial role."49 The agency of a franchised copy of the 48.

Great artworks have the capacity to attract history and social entanglements. The enrichments of time and context did not cease when an African piece was "collected" and then exhibited as Art, even though the original empowering story was forgotten. In the 1920s its new public approached it initially with minds filled with opinions about "the Negro mind," often taken to be spiritually superior, because more primitive, to the decadent or materialistic modern world. It was important to know that the piece was truly "traditional," made for ritual use by a particular "tribe" and not for the market. Later, as the activity of collection itself expanded, new attitudes and new knowledge shaped evaluations of African works, which came to be judged by their relationship to celebrated, iconic models. Bought, sold, exhibited, and flattered by glossy photographs, the most valued pieces, such as a Mangaaka, even a "copy," trail a history of increasing distinction and commercial value; once again, "an invisible skein of relations, fanning out into social space and social time." is, in Bamana terms, 'empty,' without nyâmà, and non-functioning, no matter how beautiful it may be."
