<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some problems with property ascription Nicola Knight University of Michigan/London School of Economics and Political Science Rita Astuti London School of Economics and Political Science We discuss the practice of property ascription in anthropology. While recognizing that it is an inevitable and often useful way to convey the knowledge that anthropologists have acquired through ethnographic fieldwork, we identify three of the most common ways in which ascription can be misleading. First, when a property is ascribed to a collective entity, but it is unevenly distributed among social sub-groupings; second, when an ascribed mental property is alleged to cause an individual's behaviour, but the property proves to be empirically unsupported; third, when a belief is ascribed to an individual, while another belief that effectively contradicts the first one is also entertained by that same individual. We review anthropological and psychological solutions to these problems. Ascription in general Through fieldwork, anthropologists acquire knowledge about what individuals in a social group tend to do and say. They also progressively become able to make accurate inferences about the desires, beliefs, preferences, and so on, of some individuals in that group. In writing ethnography, anthropologists routinely ascribe such behavioural and mental properties to some or all individuals in their chosen population. In this paper, we look at some troublesome aspects of the practice of ascription in anthropology. To begin, we need to specify what we mean by ascription. Ascription refers to the practice of attributing a property to an individual or a group. There are several kinds of ascription, dealing with different aspects of the individual or group in which one is interested. Most individual physical properties can be ascribed after a single observation (e.g. *x has blue eyes'). In contrast, behavioural properties, while observable, require at least repeated observation to be accurate. For example, imagine that an observer wishes to state that a certain individual wears hats - clearly, a single observation of hat-wearing behaviour is not sufficient. Of course, this is not to say that individual behavioural properties cannot be ascribed at all. Someone need only observe a consistent pattern over a period of time and report it; if the person in question wears a hat significantly more frequently than others in his social group,1 then lournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="2">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S143 the ascription is warranted. This is not to say that it is an error-proof endeavour: for example, once a working hypothesis has been established (in this case, that someone wears hats), the observer can unwittingly assign more weight to instances that confirm, rather than disconfirm, the hypothesis.2 Luckily, biases of this sort can easily be con trolled by simple statistical means. In many cases anthropologists are interested in going beyond simple behavioural observations to describe mental activity - beliefs, desires, preferences, emotions, and so on. This endeavour still requires the anthropologist to rely on the observation of behaviour, and to infer the existence and characteristics of mental activity from those observations.3 This process of inference is more error-prone than that involved in the ascription of readily observable properties, such as behavioural or physical traits, because an inferential step is added in order to understand the non-observable cogni tive processes believed to be the cause of behaviour (Jones 2000). The complexity of this inferential process is also compounded by the fact that we do not yet fully com prehend the nature of thought. To appreciate the extra layer of complexity that this problem generates, consider the following comparison. Celestial bodies that are too remote to be visible from earth, while not observable, can still be perceived in many cases. The discovery of their existence (and the estimation of their location and mass) often derives from the observation of unexpected movements in the trajectory of other, visible objects. Thus astrophysicists, like anthropologists, have to rely on the observation of the perceivable in order to make inferences about the non-perceivable. But anthropologists encounter an additional problem. The visible and invisible objects in which astrophysicists are interested are fundamentally homogeneous. This has resulted in the establishment of standard proce dures for locating non-visible objects in space. Thought, on the other hand, is quite different from behaviour. Thinking ultimately takes the form of electrical activity in the brain. Beyond that, there is no agreed-upon description of the form of mental activity except that it consists in some sort of computation. That is problematic, because the neural level is not necessarily the most valuable level of description of all cognitive processes. Psychology, and the cognitive sciences in general, have not yet reached a stage of development where they can produce laws of mental activity comparable to those of astrophysics. Because there exist no universally applicable formal principles to guide belief ascription, social scientists often use an intuitive process. This, a component of the human 'mindreading' system (Harris 1992; Nichols &amp; Stich 2003; Perner 1993; Wellman 1990; Wellman, Cross &amp; Watson 2001), is remarkably efficient in guiding our everyday interactions with other human beings (and some animals, some imaginary entities, and perhaps even some inanimate objects), and as such it is routinely exploited by anthropologists in the field, even without their awareness. Lienhardt (1961), while describing an instance of Dinka sacrifice, invokes the notion of Collec tive concentration of attention on a single action, and postulates that this is a defin ing characteristic of such ritual activity. He does not operationalize this notion or speculate on its psychological nature; and yet, as inferred by Carrithers (1992), he is able to perceive that collective concentration is taking place from a variety of cues such as eye gaze, body orientation, and changes in activity. The nature of many intui tive cognitive systems devoted to the understanding of social dynamics is such that they are often employed by anthropologists in the field before becoming the object of psychological research. Indeed, psychological arguments for the existence and importance of the joint attention mechanism as a building block of the human Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="3">S144 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti capacity for culture have only recently been made by Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, and Moll (2005). The capacity of anthropologists to use intuitive, informal attribution has the distinct advantage of allowing them to understand the people they study with reasonably high success and reasonably little effort, and to pass on this knowledge to others. At the same time, the unreflective use of ascription can lead to inaccurate or misleading descrip tions. By way of example, let us consider a typical anthropological ascription: 'The Dobuans are bad sailors, hugging the reef and disembarking every nighf (Benedict 1989 [1934] : 157, our emphasis). The italicized claim is a behavioural ascription, based on Reo Fortune's observations during his fieldwork in Dobu, and is entirely justifiable - assuming that it is supported by easily obtainable and verifiable evidence. We can guess that Fortune accurately observed that Dobuans did not stray far from the reef, nor did they show any willingness to sail overnight (in sharp contrast with the members of other Melanesian societies). But note that the quote also carries an implicit ascription of a mental property, captured by the evaluative expression 'bad sailors'. In this case, it is clear that by the use of the word 'bad', Fortune intends to emphasize that the Dobuans' tendency to hug the reef does not derive from, say, a religious rule prohib iting high-seas navigation, but rather from the fact that the Dobuans, lacking any special necessity to engage in demanding sailing activities, devote little effort to the improvement of their nautical skills. It would be surprising if a competent anthropologist such as Fortune had completely failed to grasp the reason for the Dobuans' lack of sailing proficiency; readers are aware of that and so, when reading the above statement, are immediately able to understand what it entails. But not all forms of ascription are as useful as this one; and the ease with which anthropologists produce ascriptions, and readers understand them, means that some misleading ones may well go unnoticed. There are many ways in which ascription can be misleading. We will focus on what we see as the most common and problematic cases, namely those where: 1. a property is ascribed to a collective entity, but it is unevenly distributed among social sub-groupings; 2. an ascribed mental property is alleged to cause an individual's behaviour, but its existence is empirically unsupported; 3. a belief is ascribed to an individual, although another belief that effectively contradicts the first one is also entertained by the same individual. The first sort of problem has been recognized by anthropologists and has been, in our opinion, successfully dealt with. The other two, which deal with anthropological claims about cognition, will need to be rethought in the light of what we now know about the operating principles of the mind. Collective ascription and social variability Collective ascription refers to the practice of attributing properties to groups rather than to individuals. This is in many ways unavoidable, in that the aim of most anthro pologists is to present culturally distributed patterns of action and belief, rather than idiosyncratic ones. However, when a property is unevenly distributed among the members of a society, and its distribution happens to map onto some social sub groupings, ascribing that property to the entire society is unwarranted. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="4">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S145 A number of anthropologists, starting more formally with the establishment of the 'ethnoscience' approach in the 1960s, have tried to show how collective ascription has the potential to mask the diversity present in even the smallest society (Bernard et al. 1986; Pelto &amp; Pelto 1975; Rodseth 1998; Vayda 1994). While these anthropologists did not dispute the usefulness of generalized abstraction, they also believe that it should not be the discipline's single aim or sole form of presentation of evidence. Vayda (1994) and Pelto and Pelto (1975) went further by saying that the study of variation is potentially even more revealing than the study of shared properties. This approach takes as its starting-point empirical observations of intra-cultural differences in knowledge or belief and tries to map them onto grouping variables such as age, urbanization, and gender. These grouping variables are implicitly assumed to be (at least in part) causally responsible for the existence of differences. A number of empiri cal studies demonstrate the existence of, and propose explanations for, intra-cultural differences in a variety of domains, including: preference for delayed economic grati fication in Uganda, across the rural/urban axis (Thompson 1975); medical knowledge in a Tarascan community, across age and expertise levels (Garro 1986); botanical knowledge among the Aguaruna, across expertise levels (Boster 1986); and beliefs about the role and significance of breastfeeding among the Navajo, across age and degree of bilingualism (Wright, Bauer, Clark, Morgan &amp; Begishe 1993). It has now become impossible for anthropologists to ignore the uneven distribution of cultural content across adults in any society. More recently, some anthropologists have proposed that differences between chil dren and adults are also very relevant. In particular, Toren (1993) and Hirschfeld (2002) have noted how, since anthropology is primarily concerned with culture, and since much of culture is believed to be socially transmitted, interactions between older and younger generations are presumably responsible for the reproduction of a large amount of cultural knowledge. In spite of these crucial implications for the study of culture, and of the availability of several ethnographies dealing with childrearing prac tices, child health and nutrition, and other related matters, no strong anthropological interest in development has emerged. Conversely, the psychological study of cognitive development has generated an impressive number of findings relating to the develop ment of the understanding of the biological world, other people's beliefs and desires, number and mathematics, physics, and social groupings, which are all but ignored by anthropologists, regardless of how relevant they may be to their concerns. The use of collective ascription (perhaps a reflection of this neglect) can obscure the highly impor tant processes whereby culture is acquired, and misleadingly present an image of society where a 7-year-old, an adolescent, an adult, and an elderly person perceive and think about the world in just the same way. The theoretical stance of these ethnoscientists and developmental anthropologists, regardless of their differences, contrasts sharply with old and new defenders of the particularist approach, particularly of the postmodern variety (e.g. Crapanzano 1980; Price 1998), who, while anti-essentialist in orientation, are not concerned with the explanation of variability. The non-postmodern approach to intra-cultural variability, we might say, is concerned with variability that is not random with respect to the socio-cultural environment (Malley &amp; Knight in press). Many postmodern anthro pologists, instead, are in general interested in variability per se. Variability, in this latter sense, is perceived as being irreducible to social or cultural categories - or at least such reduction is judged to be uninteresting. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="5">S146 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti Ascription of empirically under-supported mental properties The type of collective ascription criticized above fails because social variability is not taken into account. If a property is temporary or in flux, or if not all members of a social group can be shown to possess a certain property to a similar extent, unquali fied collective ascription is not an adequate means of description. Other problems with ascription are neither as obvious to see nor as easy to correct. In some cases, anthropologists explicitly state that the property they ascribe to a group is meant to be possessed by all of its members; the degree of intra-cultural variability is presumed to be minimal.4 There is nothing psychologically unsound about this approach; but if the ascribed property proves to be empirically unsupported, the ascription is unwar ranted. Here, we look at two examples: the ascription of 'structuring' and 'irrational' beliefs. The ascription of 'structuring' beliefs Naming one of his influences as Freudian psychoanalysis, L?vi-Strauss is well known for ascribing unconscious motives to people that cause their thoughts to be structured in certain cross-culturally recurring ways. Defenders of the structuralist approach postulate the existence of a level of cognition which is inaccessible to conscious thought, but which none the less informs it. L?vi-Strauss, like Freud, insisted (quite rightly, as it turns out) that people are often unaware of what drives them to action. The L?vi-Straussian unconscious, however, differs in significant respects from the Freudian one, most importantly in that the former is not thought to originate in the affective bonds of the family and society (H?naff 1998). In a sense, L?vi-Strauss adds to claims about the psychic unity of humanity a multi-layered view of the mind, in which primacy is given to the structuring unconscious (the mind that causes) over the conscious (the mind that thinks). But besides the now dated characterization of psy chological processes as either fully accessible or fully inaccessible to consciousness, the problem with structuralism and similar psychoanalytic theories is that most of the explanatory work is done by mental structures whose nature and workings are extremely vague. As a result, while they can be invoked to produce plausible a posteriori explanations of certain phenomena, it is very difficult to produce a test that can give evidence for the phenomena being the product of these structures, or of some quite different structures or processes. For example, L?vi-Strauss proposes that all humans are endowed with a 'dualistic' or 'binary' mind. A direct consequence of this is that all sorts of cultural phenomena - ranging from social organization patterns to categorization to myth - are dually struc tured, one part standing in opposition to the other in various ways. While it is true that many cultural products are indeed dually structured, we should not immediately subscribe to L?vi-Strauss's conclusion that they are so structured because they are a product of a dualistic mind. Indeed, almost everything we know about cognition today suggests that the brain is a collection of specialized mechanisms dedicated to handle specific input (see, e.g., the papers in Hirschfeld &amp; Gelman 1994). L?vi-Strauss's theory can account for the patterns we observe, but it is neither strongly predictive (because all sorts of cultural objects can stand in all sorts of binary, ternary, quaternary, etc., opposing relations to almost anything else), nor does it converge with other evidence about mental processes. Other symbolic approaches run into similar problems. Jones classifies structuralist ascriptions of cognitive properties as a type within the category of ascription of Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="6">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S147 unconscious symbolic beliefs, which he defines as '[beliefs] in which, without being aware of it, one categorizes things as having attributes far different from the ones that appear on the surface' (2000:132). Jones observes that the cognitively na?ve theory of the unconscious that characterizes such kinds of ascription makes it impossible to decide which thoughts are being processed beyond what can be directly perceived from the environment. This impossibility renders arbitrary the choice of one thought over others as a means of explanation. Jones defends the idea that there are empirically sound ways to constrain the range of possible thoughts taking place in someone's mind at a specific time. Psychological theory, unlike structuralist and psychoanalytic theories, allows one to place such constraints by postulating that the mind is organized in such a way that only a restricted number of related thoughts can become available at any one time. The associative structure of semantic memory is an example of a mechanism that could serve this purpose, at least in some cases. The ascription of 'irrational' beliefs 'The Bororo ... boast that they are red Araras [Macaws].' That does not simply mean that after their death they become Araras, nor that the Araras are Bororo metamorphosed, and must be treated as such. It means another thing altogether. 'The Bororo,' states von den Steinen, who did not want to believe them, but had to give in to their formal statements, quite clearly state that they actually are Araras, exactly as if a caterpillar stated that it is a butterfly.' This is not a name that they are giving themselves; this is not a parentage that they are proclaiming. What they want to mean is a relationship of fundamental identity. L?vy-Bruhl 1910: part I, chap. 2, quoting von den Steinen 1894 (authors' translation) This is a well-known account of lowland South American Indians recorded by von den Steinen and used by L?vy-Bruhl as one of the main pieces of evidence for his theory of primitive mentality. This sort of ascription carries with it the implication that some fundamental cognitive properties displayed by the traditional subjects of anthropo logical inquiry differ dramatically from those of Westerners. Debates about the ratio nality of primitives' have a long history in philosophy and the social sciences and focus on many different aspects (Hollis &amp; Lukes 1982; Wilson 1970). Here, we will focus on 'irrational' beliefs of the sort reported by von den Steinen and briefly sketch the two most popular positions taken in this debate - intellectualism and symbolism - and one possible solution to the disagreements, and then relate these three positions to the practice of ascription. Many anthropologists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were concerned with showing how 'irrational' beliefs such as those relating to magic were in fact fully rational, given the limited or erroneous knowledge available to people in the specific group in which such beliefs obtained. This approach, championed by J.G. Frazer (Frazer 1976 [1890]) among others, has become known as 'intellectualism'. In contrast, defendants of the symbolist approach like Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, and L?vi-Strauss propose that the language used to express apparently irrational beliefs is not to be interpreted literally. Such beliefs are simply an indirect expression of other domains, ranging from cosmology to social structure to ways of classifying the world and its contents. Therefore, apparently irrational beliefs are unproblematic - for the same reason that metaphors are not irrational. For example, a more recent ethnogra pher reinterpreted the Bororo assertion reported by von den Steinen in terms of social relations: Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="7">S148 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti It turns out that (i) only men say 'we are red macaws;' (2) red macaws are owned as pets by Bororo women; (3) because of matrilineal descent and uxorilocal residence, men are in important ways dependent on women; (4) both men and macaws are thought to reach beyond the women's sphere through their contacts with spirits (Crocker, cited in Sperber 1982:152). Symbolist interpretations of apparently irrational beliefs thus appear to be quite plausible; yet when attempting to interpret other 'irrational' beliefs in the same way, one soon finds out that not all such beliefs can be so reduced to other rational meanings. For example, the Bororo also state that they can have real contact with spirits, and are quite adamant about the literal truth of such statements. Sperber (1982) has proposed an explanation that is neither intellectualist nor symbolist, but rationalist and universalist. He noted that propositions by themselves cannot be rational or irrational; it is what one does with propositions that determines their rationality. It is possible that these 'apparently irrational beliefs' are unlike other beliefs; in particular, that people have a conscious appreciation of an epistemological difference between them and purely factual beliefs. Apparently irrational beliefs are believed, but are believed in a different sense from such things as 'water wets the skin when applied to it'.5 Sperber, in other words, introduces the notion that commonly used terms used in ascription, such as thought and belief, may refer to a suite of related, but different, phenomena. The possibility that different forms of beliefs might exist should not be ignored. Anthropologists are understandably drawn to unusual, surprising, or counterintuitive utterances; but when they assert that these reflect a speaker's beliefs, they risk producing unwarranted ascriptions. Over the years, statements like 'we are red macaws' have caused observers to ascribe to the speakers the properties of irrationality, of limited understanding of the natural world and causality, and of symbolic/associative thinking. None of these strategies provides strong evidence that the property being ascribed is what is causing the 'irrational' utterance to be produced. In contrast, an approach like Sperber's is more psycho logically plausible and open to empirical confirmation. For example, when people reason about apparently irrational beliefs, we should expect that their inferential pro cesses be impaired, producing fewer and shallower chains of inference; that the prod ucts of such inferences be less readily agreed upon; and that the holders of these beliefs refer to authority more often. Intra-individual variability, context effects, and the ascription of belief In this section, we argue that ascription can fail because of another way in which the common usage of the category of belief is misleading. We start by reviewing empirical work that suggests that incompatible representations of a single concept6 may exist in the mind and be accessed in different contexts, and we will suggest that to ascribe one form of belief when one has evidence of incompatible representations is deceptive.7 In the following discussion, we take it for granted that there is value in studying aspects of culture in relative isolation. We recognize that this is not an uncontrover sial claim. Stafford (this volume) argues that the uneasy relationship between anthro pologists and psychologists originates in this very issue, and rightly points out that there is much to be learned by looking at many aspects of a culture at once. Here, as in the rest of this paper, we have no intention to dismiss anthropological methods altogether, but wish to suggest that the problems that we illustrate in this section Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="8">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S149 can in most cases be circumvented through careful use of methods derived from psychology. Evidence for the existence of incompatible representations 'Virgin birth' among the Australians and Melanesians Starting in the late 1800s, ethnographic reports started appearing which purported to show that people in some Australian and Melanesian societies lacked knowledge of the link between sexual intercourse and procreation (or, in other interpretations, of the sperm and egg fertilization process, and in others still, of physiological paternity). These reports provoked widespread discussion in anthropological circles. In an early review, Ashley-Montagu stated that 'by far the largest number of field-workers assert that the Australians are ignorant of the relationship between intercourse and childbirth' (1937: 176). He also noted how contemporary critics either believed that Australians never possessed this knowledge, or that they had, but then lost it through the acquisi tion of new and incompatible spiritual beliefs. Several decades later, Leach (1961; 1966) reignited the debate, partly in response to the continued claims of some anthropologists (notably Spiro 1968) about lack of knowledge of physiological paternity among Australians. Leach, in his typically impassioned style, presents several strands of evidence for his conviction that Aus tralians and Trobrianders are not ignorant of such facts. First, he notes how Roth, the author of the late eighteenth-century ethnography of the Tully River Blacks that started the controversy, reports that his informants freely stated that the cause of pregnancy in animals other than humans is indeed copulation. Secondly, Leach refers to more recent ethnography by Meggitt, which suggests that context may make a difference to how Walbiri talk about conception: '[I]n ritual contexts, men speak of the action of the guruwari (spirit entities) as the significant factor; in secular contexts they nominate both the guruwari and sexual intercourse. The women, having few ritual attitudes, generally emphasise copulation' (Meggitt 1962, cited in Leach 1966: 40). Lastly, Leach suggests that Roth's and other anthropologists' tendency to attribute implausible beliefs to non-Western people is simply a reflection of their beliefs in the irrationality of primitive peoples. After all, Westerners also have beliefs about virgin birth, but these are imbued with religious significance, and play an insignificant role in everyday life; therefore, these 'untrue' beliefs about procreation should be interpreted in structural terms, as key elements of a cross-culturally recur rent pattern of ideas. Unfortunately, the evidence is insufficient to allow us to settle the question of what Australians and Melanesians actually knew about reproduction.8 But it is possible that they had incompatible representations of reproduction in which one version of the concepts was used in everyday contexts (e.g. when talking about non-human animals, and possibly in some instances even when talking about humans), while the other, akin to religious dogma, was reserved for the ritual context and for answering direct questions about the process of social reproduction. Leach seems to intuit this possibility, but he is unable to articulate this in psychological terms because of his reliance on the old anthropological notion of belief that Sperber criticizes. We will return to the question of belief and rationality at the end of this section, after giving further examples of incompatible representations from the anthropological and psy chological literature. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="9">S150 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti Understandings of biological inheritance among the Vezo During her fieldwork in Madagascar, Astuti noted that Vezo adults invoke a variety of social mechanisms to account for the physiognomy of their young infants. For example, a child might be said to look like someone his mother used to dislike when she was pregnant or like someone in whose company she used to spend a lot of time; the infant's appearance might suddenly change because of a spirit's unwelcome visitation; the birth of a baby with a misshapen foot might be explained by the fact that the mother, when still a child, used to make fun of a person with a similar handicap; and so on. What is striking about these causal accounts is that they all establish the resem blance of infants with people who are not biologically related to them. Therefore, based on what they say about their children, one could conclude that Vezo adults do not distinguish between social and biological causality, as they seemingly ignore the role that procreation plays in the transmission of bodily properties from parents to off spring. This conclusion has great theoretical relevance for anthropology, because it appears to support the culturalist orientation in kinship studies, which claims that people in different cultural traditions have radically different understandings of the process of birth and of biological kinship, often emphasizing social aspects at the expense of biological ones. Yet Vezo adults are also able to articulate a different view of the processes that give babies their looks. When asked to reason about the hypothetical adoption of a child whose birth parents had died soon after the birth of their son, Vezo adults over whelmingly judged that the adopted child would grow up to have the same bodily properties of his birth parents, while sharing the beliefs, skills and customs of his adoptive parents (see Astuti, Solomon &amp; Carey 2004 and Bloch, Solomon &amp; Carey 2001 for further details). Vezo informants thus articulated different representations of the process of procreation and reproduction and of the link that exists between parents and their offspring. Crucially, the biological representation is articulated when people reason inferentially about fictional kinship relations. In contrast, when people are engaged in social life, they tend to articulate the non-biological view. By claiming that infants resemble those who are not biologically related to them, people manage to extend and stretch kinship relations well beyond the boundaries of bio logical kinship. Understandings of non-human life forms among the Ma' Betis?k Karim (1981) reports that the Ma' Betis?k of Malaysia hold a belief system about plants and non-human animals and their relation to humans that contains two irreconcilable views. The first, expressed by the concept of tulah (curse), refers to the idea that plants and animals, having been cursed by the ancestors, are fit for human consumption. The second, expressed by the concept of kemali (tabooed object), refers to the idea that 'acts involving the killing and destruction of plants and animals bring humans misfortune and death because both plant and animal life are derived from, and are essentially similar to, human life' (Karim 1981:1). As in the Vezo case, tulah and kemali ideas are often relegated to specific contexts - the former appearing more frequently when people engage in economic activities, the latter when they do so in ritual ones. Understanding of God among US students Barrett and Keil (1996) found a discrepancy between the way US college students thought about God when asked directly and while engaged in recall tasks. As the authors Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="10">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S151 expected, participants explicitly represented God as possessing a number of non anthropomorphic properties such as omnipotence, omnipresence, infinity, non materiality - in accordance with current theological principles. However, when asked to recall and paraphrase stories, they attributed more anthropomorphic traits to God: for example, they tended to imagine God as moving very swiftly from place to place rather than being everywhere at the same time. This example suggests that the non anthropomorphic properties that people learn and explicitly maintain to be characteristic of God are not easily accessible when performing moderately taxing cognitive tasks. Self-construal among Westerners Psychologists Hazel Markus and Shinobu Kitayama (1991) have argued for a cultural tendency to construe and perceive the self as more or less interdependent, or con nected to other members of one's group. They have also suggested that different patterns of self-construal prevail regionally, and in particular that the Japanese and other East Asians rate high on the interdependence scale, while Americans of Euro pean descent rate low. More recently, a large number of studies have shown that forms of self-construal appear to affect other aspects of cognition, such as categorization, inductive reasoning, and so on (Knight &amp; Nisbett 2007; Nisbett 2003; Nisbett, Peng, Choi &amp; Norenzayan 2001). Yet, regardless of their broad cultural patterning and wide cognitive impact, these conceptions of the self have also been found not to be fully stable within cultures. Gardner, Gabriel, and Lee (1999) showed that it is possible to make European-Americans answer questions about social values in a more interde pendent manner if they are subtly primed beforehand by having to circle plural (rather than singular) pronouns in a text, as part of an unrelated reading task. The effect found by Gardner etal., while not invalidating the findings of Markus and Kitayama (1991), shows that the cross-cultural differences may be best explained by the culturally influenced preferential adoption of a cognitive style. This hypothesis is both plausible, because it does not require radically different cognitive endowment at birth, and interesting for anthropologists, because it offers a way of explaining cul tural variability. More to the point, it shows once again that people can hold con trasting and incompatible representations of the same concept - in this case, the self - and deploy them in different contexts. Theories of incompatible representations and their relation to ascription In the above examples, the context in which a concept is deployed was shown to have an effect on the way it was represented. It is trivially true that all of cognition takes place within a context. It is equally self-evident for anthropologists that different contexts elicit different behaviours. The role of context in shaping behaviour is a popular topic in psychology (see, e.g., Darley &amp; Batson 1973; Ross &amp; Nisbett 1991), but the possibility of concepts being represented and deployed in radically different ways according to context is relatively understudied. This possibility significantly impacts the practice of ascription. Statements to the effect that: Australians and Melanesians believe that there is no link between sexual inter course and procreation; the Vezo believe that bodily properties are socially transmitted; the Ma' Betis?k believe that animals and plants are human-like and therefore unfit for human consumption; Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="11">S152 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti European-Americans believe God to be omnipresent and the self to be an inde pendent and bounded entity are not erroneous. However, they are incomplete, because they fail to mention that virtually opposite forms of these beliefs are held by the same individuals and deployed in certain contexts. It is true that anthropological terms such as 'contested' and 'negotiated', routinely used to qualify the nature of ascribed meanings and beliefs, are evidence of an intuitive appreciation of the problems of belief ascription. However, such terms rarely carry with them the precision necessary to do justice to this particular phenomenon. The need for a change in language is clear, but exactly what sort of change is needed depends on a full understanding of the cognitive underpinnings of incompatible representations. While we are still far from such an understanding, contemporary theories of con cepts offer some clues. It has often been assumed that concepts are represented by linguistic (or language-like) lists or networks of features. These feature lists are thought to be instantiated in a non-linguistic, amodal form in the brain. A closely related and widely accepted assumption is that concepts are context-independent - the representation of the concept of chair, for instance, includes features such as has legs, is used to sit on, and so forth, but excludes such information as where a chair is usually found. Some psychologists, however, disagree. Lawrence Barsalou and his col leagues (Barsalou 1982; 2002; Barsalou et al 1993; Yeh &amp; Barsalou 2006) have argued that concepts are mentally represented by a combination of generic and episodic information. Furthermore, they have challenged a fundamental assumption of cat egory learning, that the cognitive system collects shared features of concepts while discarding information about the situations in which one is likely to encounter the concepts. According to Barsalou, background information of this sort is stored along with feature information, and influences performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. The information that is relevant for a concept varies depending on the goal of the situation. For example, Barclay, Bransford, Franks, McCarrell, and Nitsch (1974) pre sented participants with a series of sentences containing the same word (e.g. piano) in different contexts. Some of the sentences stressed one feature of the target word (e.g. The man lifted the piano) and some another (e.g. The man tuned the piano). After studying the sentences, participants were asked to recall them, and were given cue words to help recall. Sentence recall was significantly better when cues were related to the situation-specific concept of the target word (e.g. heavy, for the first example) than when they were related to the target word but not to the situation (e.g. has a nice sound, for the first example). Barsalou and colleagues' proposal offers a very general explanation for the sort of phenomena we are describing. However, the situated cognition model needs some modifications if it is to be used to explain our examples of incompatible representa tions. Whereas the features of the piano evoked in different contexts in Barclay et a/.'s experiment are not contradictory (it is easy to state that a piano is both heavy and sounds nice in the same sentence), the features of the cases we describe above are always so (it is harder to state that sexual intercourse does and does not play a role in procreation at the same time). In other words, while it is true that a certain situation may cause participants to be more attentive to certain features at the expense of others, in the examples we outlined above situations seem to cause participants to attribute to concepts certain features in one situation and their opposites in another. By analogy, we lournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="12">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S153 should be able to devise a situation in which people readily attributed the feature of lightness to a piano - that, however, does not seem plausible. This issue should not induce us to believe that incompatible representation is not explainable within the framework of situated cognition. It is possible that the set of incompatible representations we looked at form a subset of all instances of situated cognition, characterized by this peculiar context-dependent denial or affirmation of features. We give two arguments to support this suggestion, one psychological and proximate, the other anthropological and ultimate. First, current psychological models of semantic memory can provide a simple implementation of the process of incompatible representation. Network theories of semantic memory suggest that incompatible representations may not require special ized psychological machinery. Memorized concepts are generally believed to be roughly instantiated in network form, with a central node and several associated properties instantiated as links to other nodes. Each of the links that connects central and peripheral nodes is weighted: that is, it is more or less strongly associated with the concept. The number and weight of links attached to each concept vary according to social, cultural, and individual factors. Some concepts are linked to a number of attributes in complex ways: different contexts may cause the weights to alter so that some properties become more strongly activated and others less so. If we think of concepts as network representations with a weighted set of properties, it becomes possible to sketch a basic psychological model of how incompatible representations may be processed in the brain. The properties of concepts with incompatible repre sentations could be grouped into two (or more) mutually exclusive subsets. When a certain context causes a significant number of the members of the first subset to fire, members of the other subset stop firing and become inhibited, and vice versa. The difference between incompatible and normal representation could, therefore, be merely quantitative. But this account of process is insufficient; we also need to ask why incompatible representations should exist at all, where ordinary cognitive tasks can be tackled with little effort by the situated cognition model. Maurice Bloch (1989a; 1989t) has suggested that anthropologists' fascination with rituals and the ritual context has often obscured their understanding of other, more mundane ways of conceptualizing the world that take place outside of that context and in many ways contradict it. Non-ritual ways of thinking about the world are based in humans' (evolved) cognitive capacities interact ing with, and developing in, a varied social and ecological environment. Yet anthro pologists have been singularly reluctant to talk about non-ritual cognition, perhaps because it is less obviously variable across cultures (and thus less 'visible'), or perhaps because of a vested disciplinary interest in emphasizing difference. Bloch (1989t) has suggested that several anthropological claims about ways of experiencing and under standing the world presented as being peculiar to certain societies (such as the non durational concept of time that Geertz ascribes to the Balinese) are indeed incomplete. What they show is not the existence of radically different ways of conceptualizing the world, but rather the fact that people in different cultures will use in the ritual context versions of some everyday concepts, ideas, and so on, that are incompatible with their everyday use. In another paper, Bloch (19890) has also proposed that the products of cognition in the ritual context be termed 'ideology'. Cognition in the ritual context is only explainable with reference to the process of political domination. The practice of ritual creates images of society that contradict everyday understandings of it; these Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.), S142-S158 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="13">S154 Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti images are endorsed by those who hold the power, and serve both to legitimate power and to 'mystify, invert and hide the real conditions of existence' (Bloch 1989a: 130). The everyday/ritual distinction seems to provide a prima facie explanation for most of the cases of incompatible representation we outlined above. It is also psychologically plausible, in that it underscores the role of cognitive effort in dealing with certain concepts or, more accurately, with certain ways of representing concepts. Cognition in the ritual context seems to be more expensive - affording fewer and shallower infer ences, and so on. This is not surprising; after all, Bloch's argument is an evolutionary one, suggesting that the mechanisms used in non-ritual contexts are better suited for the majority of mental activity, which happens to take place in the everyday, non-ritual context. However, it appears that not all cases of incompatible representation can be mapped on an everyday/ritual context shift. Take, for example, the shift between independent and interdependent views of the self that Gardner et al. (1999) demonstrated. This phenomenon does not appear to be dependent on ideology and the ritual context. Both views of the self are equally ontologically plausible and philosophically defensible; both are emphasized in US culture. This suggests two alternative interpretations. On the one hand, it may be that what we are calling incompatible representations are a psycho logically unitary phenomenon, which in some (or even in most) cases can be explained in terms of Bloch's theory. Cases such as the representations of the self could simply be less typical exemplars. On the other hand, it may be that incompatible representations are only superficially similar phenomena with different psychological underpinnings. From the few instances of context-dependent incompatible representations that have been described by anthropologists and psychologists, it is difficult to choose between these two alternatives. Conclusions In the course of this paper, we have noted several problems with ascription as it has been practised in anthropology. We would like to emphasize once again that ascription is a given of anthropological writing, in many ways unavoidable, and in a large number of cases even beneficial to understanding. Collective ascription that is justified and well supported is an excellent way to present data in a compact and easily interpretable way. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on cases where the common language of ascription is an inappropriate way of presenting evidence. Some of these cases have been success fully addressed by anthropologists. With the knowledge we now have about how ideas, beliefs, skills, expertise, and so forth, are unevenly distributed within social groups, careless claims - common only a few decades ago - that the x do or believe y (Jones 2005) have become harder to defend, and fallen out of favour among anthropologists (although they remain popular in everyday language). But the ascription of cognitive properties without sufficient justification is still practised in anthropology. The disci pline's ambitious (though not universally shared) aim to be a science of humankind means that practitioners of other, more strictly bounded and epistemologically uniform disciplines will often take issue with the methodology, theoretical orientation, or form of evidence presentation of anthropologists - this much is unavoidable, and should not necessarily discourage anthropologists from attempting to answer big ques tions. Yet to make strong claims about cognition without engaging with psychologists and other cognitive scientists is not defensible, and ultimately counterproductive, as parts of anthropology become liable to be taken over by related fields.

Royal Anthropological Institute 2008</page><page sequence="14">Nicola Knight &amp; Rita Astuti S155 A different problem arises from our description of recent findings that suggest that concepts may be deployed in context-specific, incompatible forms. This is a more difficult issue, since there is no consensus in psychology and allied disciplines as to the cognitive underpinnings of these phenomena. Until a mapping of their domain and explanation of their psychological nature are available, anthropologists would be well advised to consider contextual effects on representation, and to temper strong ascrip tions of belief in the light of the cross-cultural evidence reviewed here. NOTES We thank Maurice Bloch, Matthew Engelke, Jonathan Parry, Charles Stafford, and the participants of the 'Objects of evidence' workshop at the London School of Economics and Political Science for helpful com ments. 1 Just how much of the time one needs to be wearing a hat to have that property ascribed depends on one's assumptions and objectives. For example, imagine we want to contrast the behaviour of an individual - call him Paul - with some people who never wear hats. If we want to ascribe to Paul the behavioural property of hat-wearing, we might be satisfied if he wears a hat only infrequently. In contrast, if our aim is to compare Paul to a group of people who often wear hats, the proportion of time when Paul wears a hat needs to be significantly higher if the ascription is to be more than trivial. This, of course, is also true if we substitute groups for individuals. 2 Comprehensive descriptions of the psychological characteristics of this and other biases are available in many textbooks and collections, including those edited by Gilovich, Griffin &amp; Kahneman (2002) and Kahneman &amp; Tversky (2000). 3 Not all mental activity is inaccessible to the same degree. For example, it is argued that physiological markers of some emotions, such as fear or embarrassment, can be directly measured without necessarily having to look at measures of mental activity. Similarly, behavioural economists are able to elicit preferences by having people make choices in experimental situations, rather than stating their preferences outright. The advantage of these techniques is that they allow the investigator to circumvent problems inherent in self report described by Nisbett &amp; Wilson (1977). 4 In the previous section, we encountered cases where the property shows variability, and where this variability can be shown to map onto social sub-groupings. Now we are going to deal with cases where the property is supposed not to show variability, and therefore to be equally distributed among social sub groupings. There is, of course, another possibility: that the property shows variability, and that the variability does not map onto social sub-groupings. An example of such a property is blood type; properties of this kind are not interesting to anthropologists, because their presence and distribution in a population are not attributable to socio-cultural processes. 5 Sperber further suggests that many apparently irrational beliefs - which can take the form of statements such as 'God is everywhere' - do not refer to single, well-understood propositions. He uses the term semi-propositional to refer to those representations that can be plausibly interpreted in different ways within or across individuals. 6 Here we deal with the simplest case, in which two representations are clearly dissociable. However, we cannot exclude that in some instances, even including several of the cases we describe, further representations may exist. 7 It could be argued that the examples we review can be explained in terms of Sperber's theory, outlined in the previous subsection. That is, the Bororo could have a dual incompatible representation of the self- one as humans, the other as red macaws. While this is indeed possible - and even likely - we treat the cases we look at in this section separately, because they do not all focus on claims of irrationality. 8 Helpful evidence would include a simple experiment that required people to reason about human procreation in unfamiliar contexts. Several of the following illustrations rely on such experiments to argue for the existence of incompatible representations. REFERENCES Ashley-Montagu, M.F. 1937. Physiological paternity in Australia.
