<plain_text><page sequence="1">FACT AND VALUE IN ETHICS It is the purpose of the following paper to point out certain diffi- culties involved in the notion of value as applied to ethical problems- difficulties which spring from the ontological basis of this notion. Their analysis, therefore, may stimulate a reconsideration of the philo- sophical presuppositions and convictions underlying the contemporary theory of value. In spite of the great variety of discordant views within this theory, it may be possible to express its gist in a brief formula. This elemen- tary formula has to meet two requirements. It must (a) be sufficiently determinate to define unequivocally a basis common to the multifarious types of value doctrine; and it must (b) be sufficiently broad to allow for widely divergent interpretations of the basic assumption. The philosophy of values implies a dualistic conception of experi- ence. It is, however, not dualism as such with which we wish to take issue. Our criticism is aimed only at that specific kind of dualism which is typified in value theory, a modern variety cut loose from Platonic ontology as the ground in which the original dualism was anchored. In the dualistic view of modern value doctrine facts or events are set over against values. The terms of this alternative are defined in contradis- tinction to each other: fact is conceived as non-value and value as non- fact. Analyzing any sector of reality we arrive at a series of factual elements F1, F2, F3, and so forth. In certain cases, however, a remainder will be left which, though a part of the whole experience, belongs in an entirely different class. WSAe call this heterogeneous element a value. The analysis, for example, of a human action may reveal a series of com- ponents such as motive, volitional impulse, situation, purpose, execution, result, etc. To complete the description the analyst will finally record the courage or cowardice exhibited by the action, its value or its worth- lessness. The resulting complex may then be symbolized by F', F2, F3, . . .V. Both the meaning of V and its 'relation to the other elements of the compound admit of widely divergent interpretations. But for our present purpose this divergence and the controversies between the vari- ous schools of value theory to which it has given rise may be disre- garded. It makes little difference to our formula whether we take value to mean an unanalyzable and undefinable quality as G. E. Moore does; or whether we define it with Max Scheler and Nicolai Hartmann as an ideal entity. What matters is the basic assumption common to these and other related doctrines: the supposed heterogeneity of factual ele- ments on the one hand, and value elements on the other; and, as a</page><page sequence="2">502 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH corollary following this dichotomy, the distinction made between fac- tual and valuational judgments. The peculiar dualism characteristic of value theory is indicative of its origin. Modern thought came gradually to eliminate from the meta- physical conception of reality certain elements which it branded as "anthropomorphic," first of all the idea of ends or purposes inherent in nature. But it soon became evident that the new concept of a reality levelled down to an aggregate of facts failed to cover the whole range of human experience; and the unavailing attempts of the historical, psychological, and sociological studies to save their scientific dignity by mimicking physics only served to emphasize this failure. In an attempt to remedy the situation it then seemed advisable to fall back on the remnants of the abandoned metaphysics, formerly segregated and robbed of their ontological significance. They were combined into a "realm of values" distinct from the sphere of mere factuality which it was designed to supplement. The theory of values is the product of a process of decomposition. There is a psychological interpretation of value according to which it consists in the interest that a person or a group of persons takes in an object; or in the desire which it arouses. On this view the specific differ- ence between fact and value vanishes and our formula becomes mean- ingless. Value is reduced to a kind of fact, to the factual act, namely, of "taking an interest in . . ." or "desiring something." We are no longer facing an object of evaluation but rather the object as a factual compound in conjunction with another set of facts composed of human responses to this compound. No serious effort is made by this theory to pass from the interest which is actually taken by individuals to the intrinsically "interesting," from the listing of actually desired objects to the notion of the inherently desirable. But only the attempt to per- form this passage and to thus break through the narrowness of a "fac- tualized" conception of reality would bring the psychology of value in touch with the problem under discussion. The difficulties, therefore, under which the value theories expounded by R. B. Perry, F. R. Tenant, and other psychologists labor do not fall within the compass of our present study. So much for the justification of our formula. I now propose to point out some difficulties involved in the formula, or rather in the view which it represents. From the numerous arguments which might be set forth in this connection I select two, the first (I) taken from the idea of action as a limited unit, the other (2) from the nature of the moral judgment and its emotive basis. (I) Every action, as an event within reality, initiates a casual chain of an incalculably large number of links. Evidently it is of the</page><page sequence="3">FACT AND VALUE IN ETHICS 503 utmost importance to decide which of these causally connected events are parts of the action and which are not. Only after this is determined are we able to complete the list of factual elements constituting the action. And only on the basis of a complete account of what the action is may we discover what it is worth. By definition the statement of fact is anterior to the valuational judgment. Our formula is not reversible; and the moral appraisal is concerned with action in a precise sense of the word: not with all the events causally connected with a volitional impulse but only with those among them for which the moral agent is held responsible. But how is it possible to draw a border-line between action and incidental consequences? Shall we regard as parts of the actions only those events and elements of events which are foreseen and willed by the agent? But this is a dubious restriction. The ignorance with regard to certain circumstances or the failure to foresee certain consequences does not always exonerate the agent. Lack of foresight and knowledge frequently constitute a guilt, that is, they are considered morally rele- vant elements of the action rather than the measure of its extension. Grown into a habit this deficiency breeds vices such as levity and reck- lessness. Vigilance and circumspection, on the other hand, are insepa- rable from virtue. Thus we shall come to lay down a rule establishing the normal degree of foresight and familiarity with the situation which may reasonably be expected from any person under given circumstances. This may be a very expedient measure, helpful and even indispensable for the purposes of every day life, especially in the practice of law. From the point of view of our problem, however, the recourse to this rule of thumb is a begging of the question. What do we mean by a "normal" degree of foresight? The idea of normalcy, in this case, is neither given as a fact nor is it deducible from facts. It expresses an expectation which contains, inextricably entwined, two skeins of thought: the knowledge of what a man is able to do, and a notion of what he should do. Thus, we cannot determine an action, nor can we indicate where the action ends and the sphere of neutral happenings begins without availing ourselves of a "valuational" statement. Action as a fact with which moral theory has to deal is not a mere fact. It is wholly informed by a normative idea. Hence the supposition of two consecutive and irreversible phases of ethical reflection-statement of facts and evaluation-appears to be untenable. We have to abandon our formula, and along with it the basic assumption of the doctrine of value which this formula expresses. The distinction of facts and values in ethics proves to be destructive of the object of ethics. (2) The second, parallel argument takes its departure from an analysis of the moral judgment. An action is considered morally good</page><page sequence="4">504 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH or morally bad. According to the value theory, the process which issues in a judgment of this type passes through two distinct phases: in the first the factual elements (F', F2, . ..) are accumulated and combined into a unit, in the second phase this unit is subjected to evaluation. But this account is at variance with the data of experience. Not only do the two phases temporally overlap but they are interwoven to such a degree as to make their order reversible. The assertion that evaluation takes place on the basis of factual information can be countered with the equally correct remark that the facts are discovered in the light of the values. But this is another way of saying that the two terms of the disjunction, fact and value, are not sufficiently distinguishable to war- rant a bipartition of the process of judging. Again it becomes clear that, within the sphere of human life, facts are never given as "naked" facts; and we hasten to add that, on the strength of the same argument, values are never apprehended as disembodied entities, unrelated to facts. Notions such as just, generous, brave, etc., are present to our mind as structural principles, immersed in a factual material which they inform. As components or aspects of a model of human behaviour their identity and legitimacy result from the place which they hold within the compre- hensive pattern of a "good life." But if this is so, the word "value," suggesting as it does an externally affixed predicate, is hardly adequate and it seems advisable to replace it by the less confusing term "virtue." The distinction of two phases in the process of judgment implies still another fallacy. According to the above account, the second phase is assigned to the act of evaluation. But on a closer examination we discern a third element interposing itself between the recording of facts and their subsequent assessment. The judgment expresses an attitude that we assume, or an emotion we feel in the presence of a moral ex- perience. We witness the behavior of a person torturing a child, we are horrified, and then, translating our indignation into rational terms, we pass a judgment on this action. No matter how the precise relation between the intermediary and the resultant judgment is defined, un- questionably the latter to some extent depends on the former. There is no moral judgment without an emotional response which precedes it; no adequate judgment without an adequate response. But what is the meaning of the required adequacy? The responsive emotion or attitude which is to afford the basis for a judgment cannot itself be a judgment. It rather comes under the class of actions, and then its adequacy is synonymous with its rectitude. Consequently, the moral judgment would depend for its validity on the moral quality of an action; this quality, in its turn, cannot be established save by a moral judgment, and this second judgment would again need justification. Thus, the attempt</page><page sequence="5">FACT AND VALUE IN ETHICS 505 at the verification of a moral judgment inevitably results in an infinite regress. The argument taken from the emotive, response as a basis of the moral judgment goes beyond its immediate objective. It applies not only to the value doctrine but to any theory which approaches the ethical problem from the side of the moral judgment and its validity. In spite of the Kantians, the problem, "How are moral judgments possible?" though legitimate and even important, ranks after and not with the primary questions regarding the principles of human conduct. It is true that, as Aristotle pointed out, the good action is essentially praise- worthy, the evil action blameworthy. But the actual award of praise or blame concerns the application of the principles to individual cases rather than the principles themselves. The umpire in war-games must base his decision on his knowledge of strategy as well as on his insight into the actual situation. But it does not follow that the study of strat- egy hinges on the question: how can a just arbitration in war-games be achieved? Ethics has to develop the principles which delineate the pat- tern of a good life. The translation of the pattern from theoretical terms into terms of action is of primary import for the theory itself; for its meaning ultimately consists in projecting action. But the appli- cation of the same pattern as a standard for moral censorship is of secondary importance. We may uphold very definite ethical principles and yet be convinced that all moral judgments are merely tentative and devoid of finality. Such skepticism would be the theoretical counterpart to the practical principle which forbids us to sit in judgment over our fellow-men. Those who base ethics on a logic of the valuational judg- ment put the horse before the cart. The above considerations may prompt us to search for an ethics which is not a theory of value in the defined sense. But it seems difficult to detect an alternative. It is precisely the dualistic element of the value doctrine which fits in well with every day thought. Is it not the common way first to see what is, and then to form a judgment as to the value of the thing? Contemporary instrumentalism holds that ethics is but a develop- ment of the purposeful reflection which springs from the maladjustment of the living being within a concrete situation, i. e., from conflict and perplexity. Once we disengage this view from its naturalistic setting, we find in it not only a true observation but the premonition (or should we rather say: the relic?) of a more adequate method in moral philoso- phy. We may note the following characteristics of moral reflection as set over against other types of cognition. First, moral reflection is not the impartial and disinterested cognizance of what is, but it is guided by an interest-the interest we take in the gratification of our desires,</page><page sequence="6">5o6 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH and, more specifically, in the attainment of the ultimate goal of all desires, the realization of the supreme good. The quest for truth, in ethical reflection, is an aspect of the moral striving itself, the intelli- gence inherent in it. Secondly, the states of mind and inner experiences, made transparent by moral reflection, are intrinsically related to an end. What human nature is, stands revealed in relation to what it is not but what it might be and ought to be. The forms of inner life as, discovered by moral reflection are conative entities. Finally, the reflective thought not only elucidates that which existed anterior to it as an object of inclination and appetite. While shedding its light upon them, it subjects the objectives of striving to a critical revision and establishes an order of preference. Thus the emergence of moral reflection which culminates in the conception of ethics as a theory marks a break in life itself, the attainment of a fresh mode of action. Not only do we pass from an instinctive pursuit to a conscious grasp of our aims, but goals un- dreamed of before are envisaged. And this passage is in the nature of a drama rather than of an evolution. A perplexity in which the former means of orientation prove useless forces us into the conquest of a new freedom. The Socratic question, "What is good?" arises. Moral reflection, we conclude, moves in a sphere beyond the dualism of factual and valuational judgments, and so would an ethics which faithfully carries on the pre-philosophical process. A peculiarity of a theory of this type would consist in that any error in ethics, to be refuted as discordant with experience, would be indicative of a devia- tion from the moral process itself. Thus the testimony of every day experience which seems to favor the dualistic conception of the value doctrine is easily impeached. It expresses the superficiality of the con- sciousness bound up with the daily routine of life. We commonly be- lieve we are confronted with facts, and the facts such as they offer themselves to our inspection leave us no doubt as to their value. But we fail to engage in a deeper scrutiny which might show that the picture of the facts themselves has been inadvertently distorted by some bias or some narrowness in our moral consciousness. We fail to recognize that truth in the ethical sphere-the simple truth concerning what is-is in- separable from a knowledge, however fragmentary, of what should be, from a "conversion" of the whole mind toward its goal. Is an ethics of the type envisaged in these pages possible? If the preceding analysis is correct, no other ethics is, or ever was, possible. It is beyond the scope of this paper to show that the modern attempts at an ethics of value live on borrowings from an older theory whose principles they deny; and that this traditional ethics, ignorant of the modern dichotomy, simply took for granted what nowadays it has be- come necessary to prove. For our present purpose it may suffice to call</page><page sequence="7">FACT AND VALUE IN ETHICS 507 attention to an engrained ontological prejudice that paralyzes philo- sophical thought not only in the field of ethics. We discover something in the field of our experience, a stone, an animal, an emotion, a triangle, and we attribute to this object the title of "being." No matter what the mode of their existence be, these ob- jects "are." In a rapid survey of the meaning widely attributed to this ontological denominator we discern two chief elements. (I) Whatever is, is the object of a possible or actual knowledge, and as such it is the independent norm of the truth of that knowledge. (2) Not only is the being of a being object independent of any act of cognition, but its relationship to cognition as to a manifestation of a specifically human mode of existence is extrinsic. Not only were animals and plants and other beings things possible before man came into being (this is a matter of course), but the existence of an animal equipped with reason has no intrinsic relation to the universal pattern of existence into which all things fall. Apply these criteria to the problem in hand, and it at once becomes obvious that the concept of being as defined by them does not cover the subject-matter of ethics. An action as generous, charitable, selfish, wicked, etc., can be recognized only by a knowledge which is guided and illuminated by an interest, i.e., by a cognitive process conceived as a specifically human activity. Thus the object of this type of apprehen- sion, violating the second of the above criteria, forfeits the title to being in the strict sense of the word. We may continue to say, "This is nobly done," but we should be aware that this is a delusive form of speech. Only the substratum underlying the praised deed, a morally neutral behavior, actually is. Engrafted upon this solid, being substratum there is the relation to something which has no being but only "validity," the value, namely, of nobility. Again the unity of the object of ethics which we endeavor to vindicate is dissected into two heterogeneous elements which no logical subtlety will succeed in reuniting. Measured by the two ontological criteria the type of theory which we advocate stands convicted as "anthropomorphism." In refutation of this view our former argument must be set forth again, translated, however, from the language of ethics into the more comprehensive terms of ontology. The noble action truly is, and so also the base action, and no ontological trickery should be allowed to rob them of this title and therewith of their essential unity. Rather than cast a doubt on the ontological dignity and logical unity of moral facts we should reconsider and, if need be, reject an ontology which enforces unacceptable conclusions. Broadening the concept of being we may refuse to acknowledge the second criterion. This refusal does not result in idealism. The first criterion, the main-stay of the realistic interpre-</page><page sequence="8">508 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH tation of truth as adaequatio- intellectus, remains unchallenged. It is true that, as we cancel the second criterion, we are compelled to adopt an anthropomorphic concept of being. But is this step necessarily fatal? We suggested that the theory of values should be regarded as the product of a decomposition, with "facts" and "values" as relics, as the broken halves of an original unity. Supplementing this assertion we now contend that this disintegration took place as a result of the reduc- tion of the notion of being from a concrete, structural concept to an abstract logical denominator, from a metaphysically fruitful notion to a notion metaphysically barren but allegedly purged of all anthropo- morphic ingredients. It is the second of the two criteria of being which clinches this process of sterilization. Our present question of an ethics based on the idea of "value" cannot be severed from the larger philo- sophical context. within which it emerges. The problem of fact and value is ultimately an ontological problem. Ethics, dealing with its specific problems, has to make use of a concept of being which comes to it from contemporary metaphysics and epistemology as well as from the less articulate but pervasive ontolQgical convictions current in our time. And it so happens that this contemporary ontology, largely modelled on physical knowledge, fails to encompass the mode of exist- ence characteristic of man. Even the idealistic or phenomenological variety of the modern value theory is a twin-brother of the much despised cruder physicalism of the Neo-positivists. Man finds himself a part of the universe which he investigates; and the awareness of this situation, just as every act of human knowledge, is in its turn an event among other events which together make up the temporal texture of the world. This fact itself is undeniable, but every- thing depends upon the way in which it is interpreted and exploited. First, we may conceive of it in negative terms and consider it the ineluctable limitation of our knowledge. According to this view, our being human and therewith being in the world and a part of the world is, as it were, the only loophole granted us for a glimpse of the totality of objects. But we should as best we can abstract from the foreshort- enings and the limited range of vision entailed by the place and nature of the human observer-distortions and curtailments which are foreign to the nature of things and fortuitous in respect to the aim of knowl- edge. Like a person peeping through a chink we must be warned not to mistake the shape of the chink that frames our field of vision for the shape of the world. The followers of this negative ontology occasionally complain that all our scientific knowledge is ultimately useless to us for the conduct of our lives. It yields, they say, information on facts but no directive meaning. As a matter of fact, they play hide and seek with themselves: first having evacuated man from a concept of being which</page><page sequence="9">FACT AND VALUE IN ETHICS 509 they borrow from a misinterpreted or over-interpreted physics, they then utter surprise at not finding a place for man (for themselves) in their ontological vacuum. The other and, as it would appear, more sensible and more philo- sophical way of coming to terms with the fact of our partnership in the very world which we wish to comprehend is the attempt to make the most of this fact. We recognize in it the one avenue opening toward the core of reality; and, at the same time, we envisage the further idea that this avenue, in its turn, is an important element, nay, a basic struc- tural feature, a constituent, of reality. Man being the sole particle of being regarding which we possess an inside knowledge, despair only in the enterprise of human science can advise us to slight this unique opportunity for at least an inkling of metaphysical truth. There is no knowledge of being as such, unless this ultimate object of research be a meaningful whole. But the only imaginable standard by which both this oneness and meaningfulness can be judged is the ability of man to integrate himself within being. Terms such as world, universe, and, consequently, metaphysics are necessarily "anthropomorphic" concepts, if we mean by that name not the unwarranted transference of human characteristics to non-human reality, but the recognition of the onto- logically distinguished status of man. If the totality of being is such as not to lay itself open to a specifically human (i.e., humanly relevant) knowledge, then it is simply non-existent and metaphysics a verbal exer- cise. A positive ontology, on the other hand, far from disregarding the idea of limits of human knowledge, gives it a definable meaning. The finiteness of our knowledge, viewed as resulting from the finiteness of man, becomes indicative of the very reality which it debars from our sight. Once we have restored the concept of being to its "anthropomor- phic" fullness, the notion of facts which are something more than "mere facts," namely, intrinsically good or bad, is not only logically possible but the most natural expression of a verifiable experience. At the same time, the dichotomy of values and facts in ethics is revealed as an arti- fice which does violence to the phenomena. With the restoration of a concrete ontology, the boundary between metaphysics and ethics be- comes flexible and, at a certain level of the analysis, it vanishes alto- gether. If the integrability of man in being is accepted as a criterion of its meaningful oneness, the actual integration-man's endeavor to prop- erly fill his place in the scheme of things-on the one hand, and the comprehension of this scheme on the other, appear to be aspects of an indivisible process which aims at wisdom. The metaphysical ordo rerum becomes transparent only if matched in the human mind by the ordo</page><page sequence="10">5IO PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH amoris This being so, the question of the relation between truth and goodness arises-a problem which passes beyond the scope of the present paper.
