<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER: A CONTRIBUTION TO THE POETICS OF HIS NOVELS HEINZ-JOACHIM MULLENBROCK In recent literary critical discussions, the openings of novels have received particular attention.' The following investigation examines the importance of the novel opening in the work of E. M. Forster. Although scholarship on Forster has taken on considerable dimensions,2 this aspect of his work has received little attention. The various functions of the openings of Forster's novels will be shown by means of detailed interpretations. The Longest Jour- ney, Howards End, and A Passage to India will be used to reveal the methods the writer uses to introduce readers to his fictitious world. The Longest Journey is taken as a representative example of the fairly similar openings of the earlier novels. The opening chapter of the work reveals the advantages of the method of opening employed in the so-called Italian novels, which will be drawn on for purposes of comparison, but particularly recommends itself because of the virtuosity displayed in both style and content. To equate the openings of the novels with the first chapters is compatible with Forster's mode of opening; this procedure is further sup- ported by the consideration that it is usually only after reading the first clearly marked passage of a book that the reader decides to commit himself. Let us now turn to the introductory chapters, which are treated in chronological order. I The scenic opening of The Longest Journey (1907) corresponds in manner to the openings of Where Angels Fear to Tread and A Room with a View. Yet the opening discussion among the group of friends at Cambridge on the problem of appearance and reality reveals how different The Longest Journey- is from the so-called Italian novels. The playfully amateurish discussion and the triviality of the object in question ("'The cow is there,' said Ansell, lighting a match and holding it out over the carpet"3 is the first sentence in the novel) evoke an atmosphere of a Cambridge student group. 4 Yet, from the start, we are aware of a more serious note behind the surface of local color, even though we may not be conscious that the book's decisive theme is being adumbrated. The young man in whose room the dis- cussion is taking place-the novel's hero- finds difficulty in concentrating on the conversation. His eyes wander to the college grounds: "The great elms were motionless, and seemed still in the glory of mid- summer, for the darkness hid the yellow blotches on their leaves, and their outlines were still rounded against the tender sky. Those elms were Dryads-so Rickie believed or pretended, and the line between 1 Cf.

[Modern Philology, February 1973] 216</page><page sequence="2">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 217 the two is subtler than we admit" (p. 8). The lyrical tone which creeps into the description of his view contrasts with the exuberant dialectics of his friends and is itself a means of characterization. At the same time, the authorial comment 5 reveals that Forster has chosen for himself the role of omniscient narrator. Meanwhile, Rickie attempts to join the debate: Either way it was attractive. If she was there, other cows were there too. The darkness of Europe was dotted with them, and in the far East their flanks were shining in the rising sun. Great herds of them stood browsing in pastures where no man came nor need ever come, or plashed knee-deep by the brink of impassable rivers. And this, moreover, was the view of Ansell. Yet Tillyard's view had a good deal in it. One might do worse than follow Tillyard and suppose the cow not to be there unless oneself was there to see her. A cowless world, then, stretched round him on every side. Yet he had only to peep into a field, and click! it would at once become radiant with bovine life. [Pp. 8-9] The quotation reveals how Rickie's attempt is immediately sabotaged by his own imagination, which is inspired to flights of fancy by this somewhat ordinary animal. He forgets the problem itself, only touching on it briefly with regard to Ansell's posi- tion, and he seems to attach some im- portance to this person. The sentences introduced by "yet" show how there is little room for ratiocination in Rickie's nature by emphasizing his helplessness when faced with the two alternatives. He can only turn to his imagination, and so he gets hopelessly lost in his attempt to clear up the problem. The subjective epithet "bovine" seems to offer a safety valve for the author's growing enthusiasm for his material-that academic genre painting to which he soon adds further strokes. These confirm the reader's assumption that Ansell holds the position of high priest among these philosophic friends. Neverthe- less, it is Rickie who receives most of the reader's attention in the opening chapter of this novel of development, which focuses more closely on the hero than even the first chapter of A Room with a View. This sensitive hero and admirer of the Greek nature poet Theocritus has been out of his joyless public school for only a year6 and is benefiting from the mild intellectual climate among like-minded friends at Cambridge. As the discussion slowly fades away, his thoughts turn to the events of the day, which is likewise fading. An attractive and indignant lady breaks into these idyllic surroundings,7 throwing all but Ansell into flight and consternation. Her sprightly words to Rickie--"'I shall punish you again later'" (p. 11)-have an irony which only becomes apparent when they have been tragically fulfilled. The girl is Agnes Pembroke, whom Rickie had invited for the weekend together with her brother Herbert; he has completely for- gotten this arrangement. When he wishes to introduce her to Ansell-the only one of his friends who had not been put to flight-Ansell makes an insulting show of ignoring her and leaves the room shortly afterward: esoteric behavior which puts to the test the reader unfamiliar with the Bloomsbury rites. Rickie's explanatory remark about Ansell's humble origins (which Agnes interprets as a sign of Rickie's growing snobbishness) soon clears the air; her earlier displeasure now appears as a well-played role. Our impression of Agnes's attractive outward appearance is modified while Rickie is engaged in trying to find something to eat-a modification 5 Forster's opinion-treated in his work on the novel-that the author may take the reader into his confidence on matters of philosophy is manifest here (see Aspects of the Novel [London, 1963], p. 79). 6 In this, as in other matters-such as their artistic aspira- tions-Rickie's situation and that of the young Forster are identical. On the autobiographical aspects see, for example, Crews, p. 50. 7 Godfrey (p. 46) uses the expression "Cambridge Eden."</page><page sequence="3">218 HEINZ-JOACHIM MUJLLENBROCK which is not to her advantage. Naturally inclined to "pass things over" (p. 12), she delights in imagining how her athletic fiance, Gerald, would set upon Ansell if he ever heard of his behavior toward her. The next minute she is walking around Rickie's room ("for she hated to keep quiet" [p. 13]) where she sees a photograph of Stockholm, which she confuses with Venice. The reader may well pass over this detail, or associate it at most with a grow- ing picture of Agnes's superficiality; it is a typical example of Forster's subtle art of the casual detail which only retrospectively receives full significance-here, when the reader discovers that Rickie's mother (who is mentioned in the next sentence) fled to Stockholm together with her lover, the father of Rickie's half-brother, Stephen.8 Eventually, Agnes notices her host's deformed shoes; Rickie has a clubfoot-a deformity which links him with Maugham's Philip Carey, who also shares his un- fortunate taste in women. The horror she feels on contact with the abnormal is soon supplanted by the thought of Gerald's perfect physique. Agnes is pleased that she can banish this unpleasant phenomenon from her consciousness. Yet it is less this insight into her character which lingers in the reader's mind than that strange tension between the weak hero and the imposing guest, whose original threat struck a note which reverberates in the reader's imagina- tion. Agnes's brother Herbert now appears, having looked for a place to spend the night. Now, the emotive and poetic language used earlier is displaced by the harsher effects of social satire. Herbert has been pushed into the gutter by some lively students-his right foot is dripping wet- and so his natural anger at Rickie's for- getfulness is increased. He gives vent to his feelings in words which let his moral indignation grow apparent: "'I notice a great change in university tone"' (p. 15). His weighty entrance fully justifies the introduction which Forster gives him in a formal character sketch:9 Mr. Pembroke was nearly twenty years older than his sister, and had never been as hand- some. But he was not at all the person to knock into a gutter, for though not in orders, he had the air of being on the verge of them, and his features, as well as his clothes, had the clerical cut. In his presence conversation became pure and colourless and full of under- statements, and-just as if he was a real clergyman-neither men nor boys ever forgot that he was there. He had observed this, and it pleased him very much. His conscience permitted him to enter the Church whenever his profession, which was the scholastic, should demand it. [P. 15] The vague description-vague in its account of Herbert's appearance, yet pre- cise in its account of his personality- leaves no doubt as to the author's inten- tions and, with that, as to its reception by the reader. The closing sentence especially -which is inspired by the narrator's providential omniscience o1-clearly re- veals the author's satiric intentions with regard to this character from the start. The ensuing dialogue between Agnes and her brother fulfills our expectations: forced into the use of French by the presence of a serving woman, Herbert decisively pro- nounces on Rickie: "'He wants pulling up sharply. There is nothing original in absent-mindedness. True originality lies elsewhere"' (p. 16). Forster also uses the 8 See Gransden, p. 66; and Brander, pp. 110-11. 9 In this form, which Forster occasionally uses (see, e.g., Cecil Vyse's introduction to A Room with a View [Harmonds- worth, 1966], p. 93), we may perhaps detect the influence of Jane Austen, who herself uses the method of the formal character sketch in the tradition which reaches back to the seventeenth century. See Ludwig Borinski, Englischer Geist in der Geschichte seiner Prosa (Freiburg, 1951), p. 133; and Der englische Roman des 18. Jahrhunderts (Frankfurt am Main und Bonn, 1968), p. 304. It is also possible that certain stimuli came from Trollope, who, alone among the better known Victorian novelists, continues this tradition. 10 Herbert Pembroke actually does become a cleric!</page><page sequence="4">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 219 medium of situational comedy: "He still remembered their desolate arrival, and he could feel the waters of the Pem eating into his instep" (p. 17). Herbert's mentality is thrown strongly into relief on Rickie's reappearance. Herbert's inquisitorial mode of conversation disconcerts Rickie, who replies to questions about his future plans with obvious displeasure. Nevertheless, Herbert brings all his worldly wisdom into play: "'I have seen so many promising, brilliant lives wrecked simply on account of this-not settling soon enough. My dear boy, you must think. Consult your tastes if possible-but think. You have not a moment to lose"' (p. 19). The philistine manner of these words casts an ironical but also a sinister light on their speaker. The comic element comes close to carica- ture,"1 simultaneously making Herbert appear increasingly repellent; at the same time Herbert becomes Rickie's opponent. Even if he does not feel that Herbert represents a threat to him, Rickie is depressed by the self-assured manner of his guests. Agnes, who has moved to the background for the time being, is felt by the reader to belong completely to her brother's world, even though she quietly tries to restrain him. Herbert's manner of speech emanates from his narrow, success- oriented mentality: "'If you think that this writing is practicable, and that you could make your living by it-that you could, if needs be, support a wife-then by all means write. But you must work. Work and drudge. Begin at the bottom of the ladder and work upwards"' (p. 20). Rickie, who owes this advice to a hesitant admission of literary ambition, is over- powered by so much competence. That is why he does not think of replying that the artist must follow other laws and must try to attain the peak at the first attempt: "This is hard, hot, and generally un- graceful work, but it is not drudgery. For drudgery is not art, and cannot lead to it" (ibid.). The authorial weight of the com- mentary is not obvious since it could also stem from Rickie, who, the reader feels, is connected to the author by their common interest and the identity of their situations. The opposing ways of life are juxtaposed too glaringly in the meeting between Rickie and the Pembrokes, when Herbert's prosaic and Rickie's poetic viewpoints are confronted in a passage where Rickie poetically glosses Herbert's words: "'I think so too,' said Mr. Pembroke, sipping his coffee. 'Life without an ideal would be like the sky without the sun.' Rickie looked towards the night, wherein there now twinkled innumerable stars-gods and heroes, virgins and brides, to whom the Greeks have given their names" (p. 21). With that, the Pembrokes have served their purpose and Forster drops them for the time being, just as he drops others permanently. We see how Forster's narra- tive characteristics can already be observed down to their very details in the openings of his novels. The end of the chapter is dominated by Ansell, to whom Rickie goes as soon as his guests have left, in order to question him about his rude behavior toward Agnes. But Ansell obstinately denies having met her, particularly since he sees that Rickie has not remained unimpressed by her. And when Rickie triumphantly reminds his friend of the position he took in the dis- cussion, Ansell condescendingly declares: "'Did it never strike you that phenomena may be of two kinds: one, those which have a real existence, such as the cow; two, those which are the subjective product of a diseased imagination, and which, to our destruction, we invest with the semblance 11 Compare the following passage, where the comic effects precipitated by the nature of his character are reinforced by situational comedy: "Mr. Pembroke did not reply, firstly, because the meringue he was eating was, after all, Rickie's; secondly, because it was gluey and stuck his jaws together" (p. 19).</page><page sequence="5">220 HEINZ-JOACHIM MULLENBROCK of reality ? If this has never struck you, let it strike you now'" (p. 22). Here it becomes manifest that the meaning of the key word "real"-which has already been used on the first page of the novel-goes far beyond that epistemological problem which had served only as a pretext for a sham fight, for otherwise Ansell's position would be illogical.12 Doubtless, the reader is meant to extract Ansell's intuitive perception of Agnes's true character from this remark--a character which Rickie has already en- veloped in illusion. At this important point for our understanding of the word "real," the word has an ethical meaning; the question of the evaluation of objective facts is raised. And it is judgments, indeed, which make up the substance of this novel; Rickie must make them again and again. Because Ansell can see the dis- crepancy between the real Agnes and the one in Rickie's imagination he calls her "the subjective product of a diseased imagination." She does not come up to his standard of value and, in this sense, has no reality. For Ansell, that is the end of the matter, and Rickie can do no more than watch his friend complete a somewhat baffling drawing: Rickie "watched his clever friend draw within the square a circle, and within the circle a square, and inside that another circle, and inside that another square." When Rickie then asks the question, "'Are they real?"' he receives the answer, "'The inside one is-- the one in the middle of everything, that there's never room enough to draw"' (p. 23). In this last sentence of the chapter-- which is a paraphrase of Forster's key concept of the unseen 13-the word "real" is filled with further semantic content.14 Ansell's image adumbrates the meta- physical problem which is followed up in the novel in the form of an actual search for a last, perhaps unfathomable meaning of the universe. After reading the opening chapter of this novel, the reader will pre- pare himself for an ambitious and difficult undertaking. As in the Italian novels, the scenic representation which draws the reader directly into the story hardly permits him to notice expository necessities. As in those novels, Forster presents the majority of his main characters in the first chapter-a manner of procedure which enables him to intensify the field of contact between persons without losing the reader's atten- tion by the lengthy introduction of further characters. Other similarities can also be noted. As in A Room with a View, only more plainly so, the nucleus of the novel's conflict is contained in the opening chapter; this comes out in Rickie's contact with his unconventional Cambridge friends on the one hand, and with the bourgeois Pem- brokes on the other, wherein his future choice becomes manifest.15 In terms of external form, The Longest Journey is more like the first of the Italian novels. Although it has not the formal regularity of Where Angels Fear to Tread, the opening of The Longest Journey falls clearly into three parts. In this, the triadic structure of the novel is clearly foreshadowed. But one could go further and see an adumbration of Stephen Wonham, who dominates the third part of the book, in the picture of concentric squares and circles; for Rickie attains the symbolic knowledge that Stephen is his half-brother under the central tree of the Cadbury Rings,16 which have a similar pattern." Above all, the reader will forget the expositional situation in the immediate realization of the action. 12 See Crews, p. 61. 13 See Bonamy Dobr6e, "E. M.

M. Forster (Ithaca, N.Y., 1957), p. 110.</page><page sequence="6">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 221 Moreover, the opening is well suited to the conception of the story and reveals Forster's characteristic manner. Over and above this, the first chapter of The Longest Journey is characterized by a note of Forsterian complexity.18 While the de- scription of the student meeting is often clothed in a poetic aura, the ironic language of the satirist dominates the passages-so rich in dialogue-with Her- bert Pembroke. To this is added the symbolism of the last passage. Since the various elements are here not yet in opposition to one another, this variety, and the many-sided nature of the per- sonality behind the creation, stimulate a fascination which the reader repays by increased interest. The somewhat abrupt opening of Howards End (1910), which reveals Forster's desire to try another means of exposition, is not exactly encouraging in its effect on the reader: "One may as well begin with Helen's letters to her sister." 19 But the mild psychological damper which this mark of authorial indifference at such a key point sets into motion does not hold for long. The writer's racy style sees to that: "Dearest Meg, It isn't going to be what we expected. It is old and little, and altogether delightful-red brick" (p. 5). These first words about the house, whose name is found at the head of the undated letter, express joyful surprise at her temporary place of residence. Helen and her sister Meg had obviously imagined Howards End to be very different. The fairly quick tempo of the letter speeds up in the second part of the first paragraph, which is taken up with a description of the house's interior-a sign that Helen does not wish to spend much time on this part of the description, in spite of her own spontaneous satisfaction. The following lines, which describe the area surrounding the house, evoke greater interest and stronger emotion: "Then there's a very big wych-elm-to the left as you look up-leaning a little over the house, and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow. I quite love that tree already. Also ordinary elms, oaks-no nastier than ordinary oaks-pear-trees, apple-trees, and a vine. No silver birches, though. However, I must get on to my host and hostess" (ibid.). The wych elm on the border between the garden and the meadow differs from the previous descriptive in- formation and so helps to fill out the pic- ture of Howards End. Helen has already taken pleasure in this unusual tree-other, ordinary trees stand nearby. While an addition like "no nastier than ordinary oaks" presents a humorous Helen, the slightly disappointed note behind her remark on the missing silver birches-an example of Forster's poetic vein-suggests her to be a person of sensitivity and fine perceptions. The regretful "however" shows that she would have gladly lingered longer over this point. In any case, Howards End in no way matches the picture that the two sisters had conjured up previously, as a result of their ac- quaintance with its inhabitants, who had called to mind expensive hotels rather than the actual Howards End: "Mrs. Wilcox trailing in her beautiful dresses down long corridors, Mr. Wilcox bullying porters, etc. We females are that unjust" (ibid.). In the third paragraph of her letter, in which she announces her return on Satur- day, Helen complains about her brother Tibby's moods; because of the hay fever he contracted in London-of all places- 18 Among others, Lord David Cecil has described this: "Indeed the flavour of a Forster novel is eminently complex. The poet, the satirist and the moralist all contribute in- gredients to it .... It is this variety which gives his books their peculiar fascination" ("E. M. Forster," Poets and Story- Tellers [London, 1949], p. 193). 1' Howards End (Harmondsworth, 1961), p. 5.</page><page sequence="7">222 HEINZ-JOACHIM MULLENBROCK he needs Margaret's care. She even lets a mood approaching anger appear toward her pampered brother; Charles, the older Wilcox boy, suffers from the same malady, but he lets no one notice: "Men like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a power of good. But you won't agree, and I'd better change the subject" (ibid.). This passage docu- ments Forster's conception of his char- acters. Helen, the more impulsive of the two sisters, although later becoming a bitter critic of the Wilcoxes, is at first deeply impressed by them, and so tries to place their advantages in the best light. Margaret, the more reserved of the two, never shares her sister's sudden enthusiasm and can, therefore, at a later stage form a lasting relationship with the Wilcoxes which is based on a clearer and more rational judgment of their nature. Helen then returns to the subject which had earlier enlivened her report. She writes enthusiastically of the pleasant environment of the house, which is en- twined by a beautiful grapevine. When she looked out of the window in the morning, she discovered that Mrs. Wilcox was already outside: "She was watching the large red poppies come out. Then she walked off the lawn to the meadow, whose corner to the right I can just see. Trail, trail, went her long dress over the sopping grass, and she came back with her hands full of the hay, that was cut yesterday-I suppose for rabbits or something, as she kept on smelling it" (p. 6). That is how Mrs. Wilcox is first seen by the reader. The onomatopoeic "trail," which at first had a slightly surprising effect, makes her appear connected with the earth. Even the hay that she carries in her hand seems to speak of a secret sympathy with nature. Already at this, the first stage of acquaintance with this fictitious world of Forster's, the hay is experienced as an attribute of Mrs. Wilcox--an early example of that technique which Forster called "rhythm"-a recur- ring motif which, in its "lovely waxing and waning,"'20 reveals that intuitive wisdom gained from the past which is embodied by Mrs. Wilcox.21 Only later-the gap in time gains symbolic importance as it emphasizes her proximity to nature-do the rest of the Wilcoxes arrive on the scene, which is enlivened by their sporting activity: "They are keen on all games" (p. 6). Helen watches them play croquet and lets her sister share her first im- pressions: "Then I hear more clicketing, and it is Mr. Wilcox practising, and then 'a-tissue, a-tissue': he has to stop too. Then Erie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage-tree--they put everything to use-and then she says 'a-tissue,' and in she goes. And finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears, trail, trail, still smelling hay and looking at the flowers" (ibid.). This extract from the letter is particularly functional since it throws light both on the nature of the Wilcoxes and on the letter writer. The other members of the family, who subject even nature to practical purposes, are made to seem officious even while passing the time with sport. All other Wilcoxes are- significantly-allergic to hay.22 When Mrs. Wilcox comes into view, immediately a soothing breath seems to spread over the garden which had been filled with her family's sneezes. Her affinity to the natural world of Howards End, carried over into the kinetic sphere by the gentle repetition of "trail," transports her into a different sphere from the other Wilcoxes, who almost appear a little helpless with their reaction to the hay, which symbolizes the cycle of nature. It is hardly noticeable that the collective description of the Wilcox family is slightly stylized, since this mode of 20 Aspects of the Novel, pp. 153-54. 21 It even serves Forster for metaphorical characterization: "She was a wisp of hay, a flower" (p. 71). 22 See McConkey, p. 125; and Beer, p. 105.</page><page sequence="8">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 223 description is characteristic of Helen's impressionistic way of perceiving things. Her mischievous gift for observation manifests itself linguistically in the diminu- tive "clicketing," in the playful use of the word "tack," and also in the amusing "'a-tissue."' The latter also indicates an intimate relationship of some standing between Helen and the addressee, while the well-placed "calisthenic," which gently mocks the "unfeminine" behavior of the Wilcox daughter, reveals Helen and her sister as members of the educated upper class. That mutual intellectual interests unite Margaret and Helen, who clearly finds amusement in the Wilcoxes' activities, can be seen in the following, more re- flective passage: "I inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama, and one must learn to distinguish tother from which, and up to now I have always put that down as 'Meg's clever nonsense'" (p. 6). The last paragraph contains various omissions which, together with incon- spicuous details such as the missing date, reveal a trait of carelessness and, thus, a small blemish in Helen's charming and spontaneous character. She cannot hide her delight at the magnificent roses and, after her impish avowal of her "modified love to Tibby" (ibid.), promises further news on Thursday. The second letter is written on a Friday. In it, she shows her- self completely blinded by the Wilcox family: "I am having a glorious time. I like them all. ... They are the very happiest, jolliest family that you can imagine" (p. 7). Her first, long letter had been written from an amused distance, saying how delightful it was for her to look at the Wilcoxes' very different way of life. After only three more days at Howards End she is almost rapturous about her hosts. A fascination emanates from them to which Helen gives herself up completely with an almost self-destructive willingness, al- though it is totally contrary to her own intellectual standard of life:23 The fun of it is that they think me a noodle, and say so-at least, Mr. Wilcox does-and when that happens, and one doesn't mind, it's a pretty sure test, isn't it ? He says the most horrid things about women's suffrage so nicely, and when I said I believe in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I've never had. Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less ? I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life.... I couldn't say a word. I had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some book-probably from poetry, or you. Anyhow, it's been knocked into pieces, and, like all people who are really strong, Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting me. [P. 7] Although she doesn't give up her values, she is suddenly ashamed of her own idealistic views, which evaporate into thin air when confronted with Mr. Wilcox's self-assurance. Yet the careful reader may note that this has nothing to do with any objective values that Helen may have. For the ambivalent language24 of the passage quoted reveals that she is less prepared to question her intellectual beliefs than let the arid way of life bound up with them be put in doubt. It is now clear that the super- latives "happiest" and "jolliest," with their ingredient of inexact emotionality, had-as illustrated in the previous quota- tion-seemed to bring this aridity into question. As is shown particularly by the last sentence of the longer quotation, it is above all the masculine strength of the Wilcoxes which has drawn a receptive Helen into its net.2" This attraction captivates Helen, who probably sees her earlier world as unsatisfactory, and so she 23 See Stone, p. 246. 24 Already a word such as the adjective "horrid" supports Wilde's remark: "She happily watches her intellectual edifices crumble" (p. 110). 25 This has been most clearly stated by Trilling, albeit with the use of more material (Lionel Trilling, E. M. Forster, rev. ed. [London, 1967], pp. 108-9). Yet it clearly emerges from Helen's second letter.</page><page sequence="9">224 HEINZ-JOACHIM MiJLLENBROCK asks her sister a little reproachfully, "Meg, shall we ever learn to talk less?" Contact with the masculine world of the Wilcoxes suddenly makes her egalitarian ideals and the demand for "women's suffrage" and "equality" appear irrelevant; such words as these themselves place the novel in the years of agitation for votes for women,26 and from the start give the novel a par- ticular period coloring, which, in the semantic area, mirrors the usage of Edwardian England-as in the use of "motor" for "motor-car" soon afterward. Helen delights in being driven around in the Wilcoxes' motorcar, a sign that her flirtation with their way of life is growing more serious. But the detail hardly reveals its full meaning in this context. As so often in Forster, it only gains full signifi- cance later in the story. The sociological fact of their possession of a motorcar is only fully comprehended by the reader when he sees the Wilcoxes with their hands on the lever of economic power, even though the appropriate historical associa- tions have always been present. Similarly, the reader will only later notice the connec- tion between the "nomadic" Wilcoxes' enterprising spirit-symbolized by the motorcar for Helen-and the inroads upon the country made by urban civilization. That their energetic way of life has become a major experience for the impressionable Helen after but a short stay is shown by the last lines of her second letter in which she announces her intention of staying a day longer: ".. . at night we squeeze up in this lovely house. The whole clan's here now- it's like a rabbit warren. Evie is a dear. They want me to stop over Sunday-I suppose it won't matter if I do. Marvellous weather and the views marvellous-views westward to the high ground. Thank you for your letter. Burn this. Your affectionate Helen" (p. 7). Helen appears to have been over- come by a kind of Wilcox euphoria which spreads her enthusiasm evenly over house, family, and environment. Expressions such as "clan" and "rabbit warren," which naturally suit her diction of playful intimacy, are a sign that it is the mas- culine attraction of the Wilcoxes which has put her into such good spirits. Helen's contact with the Wilcox way of life highlights the electric tension between the sexes. Her Sunday letter tells of its immediate effect, which forms the drama- tic, but psychologically not unmotivated, ending of the chapter. It consists of a short note: "Dearest, Dearest Meg, I do not know what you will say: Paul and I are in love-the younger son who only came here Wednesday" (ibid.). The mainly scenic-and therefore fairly long-opening of The Longest Journey should introduce the reader to the majority of important characters and also raise certain expectations with regard to the novel's themes. Forster has exploited the possibilities of the form chosen for the opening of Howards End to achieve a similar effect in a far shorter space-the letters take up a mere three pages. The house in Hertfordshire which gives the novel its title appears in the first sentence of Helen's letter; thanks to the succeeding descriptions, it gains a firm place in the reader's imagination. It commands the immediate opening and then forms the background for Helen's further descrip- tions. The house is ever present in the reader's imagination, whether the action moves to London, Dorset, or Shropshire- as it does in the central portion of the novel-until at the end of the novel the various strands of the story come together at Howards End. After Helen's pre- liminary description, Howards End as a material object merges into the background 26 See Heinz-Joachim Mllenbrock, Literatur und Zeit- geschichte in England zwischen dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts und dem Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges, Britannica et Americana 16 (Hamburg, 1967), p. 110, n. 23.</page><page sequence="10">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 225 to becoine a part of its own natural sur- roundings. The close contextual link between the wych elm,27 which symbolizes the genius loci, and the hay, which from the first represents more than itself,28 prepares us for the gradual process which associates the house with the constant flow of nature as opposed to the unsteady change of modern life.29 This aspect can also be seen on the personal level. Mrs. Wilcox, whom we see as Helen had first described her right up to her untimely death, belongs more to Howards End than to her own industrious family.30 The distinction which is early drawn between her and her family, together with her closeness to nature, introduces the mystical function which she fulfills in the novel. With the house in the background play- ing its symbolic role, those antinomies which have such central importance in Forster's work are already crystallizing. Yet the warring principles could achieve nothing without the vividness of his characters. And so, the opening of the novel gains its charm above all from the fact that the reader makes his acquaintance with Helen's delightful character through the epistolary medium. We have seen how Forster lets Helen's mentality appear in her mode of expression; how individual turns of phrase, and even an unusual epithet, reveal her character. Only in the mirror of this brief yet telling character sketch do the descriptions of Howards End itself gain full significance. It is Helen's lively and intelligent nature which leads the reader over the threshold of the fictive world. Although she is not the main character, the opening of the novel does justice to Helen's position in the novel. Her impulsiveness gives the novel im- portant contours: her disappointing en- counter with Paul Wilcox will later drive her into the arms of Leonard Bast in an excess of zeal for social reform. Of course, the insight into other characters cannot be as great, because of the limitations on space necessitated by Helen's whirlwind style, which at greater length might dissipate the reader's interest. Yet enough is said about the others for the reader to associate particular ideas with them. Helen's close relationship to her sister shines through her letters. Although not a single sentence of Margaret's letter is quoted, the reader recognizes her position as that of the superior of the two who has a fond love for her livelier sister. The similarity of interests expressed in the letters and the sisters' spiritual intimacy show them in contrast to the sporty and practical Wilcoxes; because of this contrast, the two appear as a single unity in the reader's imagination. Helen's comparatively whole- sale characterization of the Wilcoxes is even functional in that it helps to convey the family's anti-individualism. Her brief letters show the contrasting groups which, the reader is already led to suppose by the title, will meet at Howards End. With that, the actual plot of the novel can begin, which the reader awaits with almost an excess of that singular and elementary tension elsewhere scorned by Forster. III The opening chapter of A Passage to India (1924) reveals that the difference between this and the earlier novels is much greater than that between any of its predecessors. Shorter than the earlier openings, the chapter consists of a general description-a form of exposition which 27 See Gransden, p. 59; see also McConkey, p. 128, n. 8. 28 Thomson gives an extensive treatment of the symbolism connected with the house (pp. 180-92), yet his detailed system of correspondences may well be better thought out than it is accurate.

Forster (London, 1938), p. 106.</page><page sequence="11">226 HEINZ-JOACHIM MijLLENBROCK Forster uses for the first time in his novels: "Except for the Marabar Caves-and they were twenty miles off-the city of Chan- drapore presents nothing extraordinary. Edged rather than washed by the river Ganges, it trails for a couple of miles along the bank, scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish it deposits so freely. There are no bathing-steps on the river front, as the Ganges happens not to be holy here; indeed there is no river front, and bazaars shut out the wide and shifting panorama of the stream." 31 After the very first words have attracted the reader's attention by their mention of the apparently interesting Marabar Caves-the natural accent of the opening is emphasized by the stress of the restrictive clause-he is met by an im- pression of gray monotony practically from the very beginning. The town on the Ganges with its bazaars which preclude a view of the water is hardly distinguishable from the rubbish which is so freely deposited. The fact that there are not even bathing steps because the river is not holy at this point is an ironic touch which-and Forster's humoristic tendency is under greater control from the very start of this work-fits in with the depressing view offered by Chandrapore in every sense: "The streets are mean, the temples in- effective, and though a few houses exist they are hidden away in gardens or down alleys whose filth deters all but the invited guest" (p. 9). The picture of hopelessness thus created is taken to another level at the end of the first paragraph: "The very wood seems made of mud, the inhabitants of mud moving. So abased, so monotonous is everything that meets the eye, that when the Ganges comes down it might be ex- pected to wash the excrescence back into the soil. Houses do fall, people are drowned and left rotting, but the general outline of the town persists, swelling here, shrinking there, like some low but indestructible form of life" (ibid.). The quotation reveals that the previous descriptions were far more than an impressionistic picture; indeed, through their drab vocabulary they contributed to the description of the existential conditions of the inhabitants of Chandrapore. The scatologically colored language-"rubbish," "filth," the twice- used "mud," "rotting"-which runs through this part of the opening is now used to characterize the inhabitants. They in no way stand out from the surrounding hopelessness of the filthy streets and de- caying houses but simply represent one aspect of the whole and even seem to be assimilated by the general hopelessness. They are a part of the general monotony, helplessly exposed to the flood tides of the Ganges which cover them like some ir- resistible force. Subjected to the vicissi- tudes of nature, the unordered but obstinately resilient life of Chandrapore goes on. Inland, the scenery changes. From the height of the civil station-the first sign of British presence-Chandrapore appears as a garden town. The tropical vegetation-- exotic plants stimulate the reader's imagi- nation-hides the picture of the uniformity of the decaying bazaars, and instead reveals a rich magnificence which gives the town the appearance of a pleasure ground. But even this splendid view of Chandrapore is determined by the superiority of nature over the works of man. While the lower town down by the Ganges oppresses the inhabitants with its cheerless dirt and, as it were, imposes upon them a lower form of existence, the lusciousness of the Indian vegetation which engluts abandoned tem- ples-and so becomes the realm of the birds-likewise exudes a menacing atmos- phere. Thus, the contrasting landscapes emphasize man's precarious existence and reveal the power of inorganic nature in this 31 A Passage to India (Harmondsworth, 1965), p. 9.</page><page sequence="12">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 227 country: "Seeking light and air, and endowed with more strength than man or his works, they [the tropical plants] soar above the lower deposit to greet one another with branches and beckoning leaves, and to build a city for the birds. Especially after the rains do they screen what passes below, but at all times, even when scorched or leafless, they glorify the city to the English people who inhabit the rise" (p. 10). Within this confusing tropical splendor, the English colony forms a strangely heterogeneous element: "As for the civil station itself, it provokes no emotion. It charms not, neither does it repel. It is sensibly planned, with a red- brick club on its brow, and farther back a grocer's and a cemetery, and the bungalows are disposed along roads that intersect at right angles. It has nothing hideous about it, and only the view is beautiful; it shares nothing with the city except the over- arching sky" (ibid.). The very fact that this does not provoke an emotional reaction suggests its stifling oddness, which is underlined by the prim, biblical ring of "it charms not, neither does it repel." It seems to represent a pathetic attempt to oppose the all-usurping freedom of Indian nature by the rational planning typical of Euro- pean civilization, most manifest in the right- angled layout of the streets. The incon- gruous sequence of the places named-club, store, and cemetery-reveals Forster's ironic questioning of the English attempt to impose rationality upon all things-- including even death-in India.32 If the dirty shabbiness of local life appears as self-resignation in the face of India's fate, the English attempt to introduce the order- liness of Europe into the land has the appearance of the irony of the inap- propriate. The gulf between the two cultures is defined by the sentence which states that the English settlement and the town have nothing in common but the sky which arches above them both. Even the sky is subject to changes, which appear to belong to the physiognomy of this strange country, but which are, in its case, less pronounced than with the vegeta- tion and the river. The sky even creates an impression of a certain constancy, for blue is at all times the dominant ingredient in its color scheme; yet finally it withdraws into infinity, which is itself unsoundable and alien to human value judgments:33 "Then [by night] the stars hang like lamps from the immense vault. The distance between the vault and them is as nothing to the distance behind them, and that farther distance, though beyond colour, last freed itself from blue" (p. 10). Man, whose uncertain existence in this naturally determined land was illustrated in the earlier descriptions, is now more precisely placed in proper perspective by the cosmic description which reveals him in all his insignificance.34 Instead of narrowing his perspective to a few characters, as, for instance, Dickens does in his first chapter of Little Dorrit,35 Forster expands the description of landscape to even greater dimensions, and thus impressively in- tensifies its effect at the end of his intro- duction: The sky settles everything-not only climates and seasons but when the earth shall be beautiful. By herself she can do little-only feeble outbursts of flowers. But when the sky chooses, glory can rain into the Chan- drapore bazaars or a benediction pass from horizon to horizon. The sky can do this 32 See also Gerhard Stebner, "Edward Morgan Forster: A Passage to India," Der moderne englische Roman: Inter- pretationen, ed.

Oliver Stallybrass (New York, 1969), p. 137. 04 Forster will manage the technique of reaching out to the macrocosmic sphere-and thus the questioning of human judgments and values against the ever receding incompre- hensibility of India-with great success. The following ex- ample must suffice: "Outside the arch there seemed always an arch, beyond the remotest echo a silence" (pp. 51-52). 35 See Wilhelm Fiiger, "Zur Kunst des Erzihlanfangs bei Charles Dickens," Die neueren Sprachen 67 (1968): 18-19.</page><page sequence="13">228 HEINZ-JOACHIM MUiLLENBROCK because it is so strong and so enormous. Strength comes from the sun, infused in it daily, size from the prostrate earth. No mountains infringe on the curve. League after league the earth lies flat, heaves a little, is flat again. Only in the south, where a group of fists and fingers are thrust up through the soil, is the endless expanse interrupted. These fists and fingers are the Marabar Hills, con- taining the extraordinary caves. [Pp. 10-11] The aloof tone which gives the chapter its special quality here receives its justification as nature, working even in the cosmic regions, is, as it were, introduced as the protagonist. The exceptional power of the sky, on whose benevolence the town depends, implies that the actual characters will be less important, even before they have themselves appeared. Their signifi- cance is limited before the beginning of the action by a setting whose life is more dependent on timeless natural phenomena than on history, not to speak of human creative powers.36 The contained tension, which has lain over the chapter from the start,37 reaches its climax in the final passage where attention is dramatically returned to the sky, which not only condi- tions the climate and the seasons but also gives Chandrapore a brief allure. It even seems to offer hope in this strange co- existence of attractive and hostile elements which make the landscape appear uncanny and disunited. Yet it remains a part of the Indian nature which, with its indifference, mocks at any harmonious mode of exis- tence, and in the last great scene it will be the sky which will sanction the vanity of human striving. Only in the south is the endless flatness of the Indian landscape broken by the Marabar Hills, with their threatening "fists and fingers." The omi- nous sound of this wording, which no doubt comes from the tension between the anthropomorphic concrete and the ab- stract elements which form a strong contrast,38 then proceeds to the caves, which were given a prominent position in the first sentence and with the mention of which the first chapter concludes. The epithet "extraordinary," 39 unexceptionable in its vagueness, yet emphasized by its repetition, which on later repetition 40 also conveys the sinister nature of the caves,41 has helped to give these caves a privileged place in the reader's imagination. Thus, the reader will associate the vague premoni- tions of evil conjured up during the course of the chapter above all with the fore- boding presence of the Marabar Caves. The opening chapter of A Passage to India-reminiscent of the symbolic opening of Conrad's Nostromo in its magnificent landscape description-is markedly dif- ferent from Forster's earlier opening chapters. The general description of Chandrapore42 stands apart from the narrative time of the novel and is, there- fore, totally removed from the flow of the action.43 For this reason, characters are not introduced, but the scene is shown in 36 The introduction broaches what, during the course of the novel, will become an oppressive insight: "The image of India as a whole is more important than any of the figures, English or Indian, who move across it" (Crews, p. 144). 37 Gransden has completely mistaken the nature of this tense and-beneath the surface-agitated first chapter when he writes of the "calm descriptive opening" (p. 88) which characterizes the beginning of the novel. I also oppose Brander's view when the latter calls the actual description of Chandrapore "quiet" (p. 164) and reserves greater linguistic intensity for the end. Rather, Forster, whose opening sentence denotes the key of the whole, has brilliantly managed to evoke a gentle and multi-layered tension which culminates in the final paragraph and dramatically arouses the reader's ex- pectation. 38 See Anna Maria Fadda, Edward Morgan Forster e ii Decadentismo, Universita di Cagliari Facolta di Lettere e di Magistero 6 (Palumbo, 1962), p. 119. 39 In Alexandria: A History and a Guide (1922), where we can first study Forster's art of describing nature from the historical and geological points of view, he forms his mode of using this word, as can be seen in the following quotation from the introductory chapter "The Land and the Waters": "The shores of this sea were a limestone desert. The coastline was smooth as a rule, but at the north-west corner an extra- ordinary spur jutted out from the main mass" (Alexandria: A History and a Guide [Gloucester, Mass., 1968], p. 5). 40 See, for instance, pages 75 and 124. 41 Frank Kermode writes: "Henceforth, in this novel, the word 'extraordinary' is never used without reference to the opening sentence. It belongs to the caves" ("Mr. E. M. Forster as a Symbolist," Listener, January 2, 1958, p. 17). 42 Forster's novels reveal only three examples of chapters which begin with general descriptions; they are all to be found in this novel (chaps. 1, 10, and 12): see Renate Jungel, "Die Zeitstrulurlin den Romanen E. M. Forsters" (Ph.Diss., Graz, 1953), p. 90. 43 Characteristically, it is A Passage to India which once again offers a parallel-here, of a chapter which stands apart from the flow of the narrative (see Jungel, p. 111).</page><page sequence="14">MODES OF OPENING IN THE WORK OF E. M. FORSTER 229 its eternal state, untouched by human influence. This style of opening creates that detachment which puts Anglo-Indian mat- ters in their true context, in which, as Stone has noted,44 the geological rather than the historical time scale prevails. That is why the characters, when they gradually appear on the scene, have already under- gone a diminution in perspective. Their actions will take place in a setting which is subject to forces which have prejudged human endeavor from the start. The hidden moment of this unique opening chapter should make us beware of inter- pretations which overstress the socio- political aspects of the book, for it shows us man in his greater, cosmic context with its attendant perils.45 Thus the explicitly formulated question in the second chapter -whether friendship between Indians and Englishmen is possible-is already lessened in importance through the thematic ampli- fication of the first chapter. The contrast between the Indian and the English ways of life in Chandrapore, which, in its sharpness, suggests the basic disharmony of the two cultures, is overlaid by the far greater contrast between human nothing- ness and the omnipotence of Indian nature shown in all its cosmic implications. This last polarity announces a more far- reaching theme which transcends merely political considerations and raises the idea of man against the universe to the level of discourse; in this way it allows the philosophical content to emerge.46 Without going into, say, Hardy's nuances, the whole description evokes the fathomless mystery of India, and so marks out the massive frame within which human activity is to be seen. Man sees himself surrounded by the tremendous irrational presence of India, which overshadows his own exis- tence. By endowing the central symbol of the caves with the mysteriousness of this country in trenchant manner, Forster can be seen to prepare consistently for that strange episode which forms the core of the novel.4" His art of exposition in the opening chapters, which moves from scenic representation over the epistolary upbeat to general description, reaches its climax in the concentrated richness of meaning of this chapter, which, as no other, contains the whole subject in essence 48 and prophetically comments on the deeds of the actors in a manner comparable to the prologues of Greek tragedy. HAMBURG UNIVERSITY 44 See Stone, p. 316. 45 Trilling, as an exponent of a mainly politically orientated interpretation, does not do sufficient justice to the concept of the work which is mirrored in the opening chapter: "The characters, that is, are in the events, the events are not in them: we want a larger Englishman than Fielding, a weightier Indian than Aziz" (p. 126). 46 The thematic implications of the opening chapter are missed by Arnold Kettle, who dismisses it as "backcloth": "The subject of A Passage to India is stated very clearly at the beginning of the second chapter, the first consisting entirely, and most economically, of backcloth" (An Introduction to the English Novel [London, 1965], 2:153). Gransden also judges somewhat hastily: "The short first chapter is purely descriptive" (p. 88). 47 See Oliver, p. 67. 48 This is not as applicable to the first part as it appears to be from McConkey's remarks based on Brown (p. 158) but projects a "complete picture" onto the reader's imagination, as does the opening chapter of The Longest Journey, in spite of the considerable difference in length.</page></plain_text>
