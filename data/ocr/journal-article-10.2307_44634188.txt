Yannaccone Forensic Safety Group Gary R. Whitman and Larry A. Sicher ARCCA Ine ABSTRACT The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in cooperation with the Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), and the Ministry of Health &amp; Long-Term Care, Ontario (Canada), conducted a test program to evaluate the capability of mobile restraint systems to protect occupants in the patient compartment of an ambulance. This paper focuses on the vehicle chassis behavior and acceleration pulses as seen in each test conducted to support the program. This program consisted of testing one Type I ambulance mounted on a Ford F-350 truck chassis (1994 vintage), and three Type III ambulances mounted on Ford E-350 van chassis (two 1993, and one 1999 vintage). A vehicle-to-vehicle side impact test was conducted using the Type I ambulance with a targeted change in velocity of 27.4 kph (17 mph). A 1984 Chevrolet Sierra 2500 was the impacting vehicle for the side test. Fixed barrier frontal tests were conducted using the Type III ambulances with a targeted impact velocity of 48 kph (30 mph). In addition to an x-axis, or forward component, each of the frontal crash pulses was found to have a significant z-axis, or vertical, component which caused a forward rotation of the patient compartment ranging up to approximately 16.5 degrees. Significant cab-intrusion was observed as a result of the frontal tests that were conducted. Vehicle weights ranged up to 5005 kg (1 1 ,035 lbs.) and were similar to operational weight conditions. The paper includes a detailed description of the crash test setup as it pertains to the chassis, vehicles tested, instrumentation, limited crush measurements, testing observations, and the resulting multi-axial pulses measured at multiple frame and patient compartment locations. This data will be of interest to ambulance and other multi-stage vehicle manufacturers for use in design, modeling, and sled testing. INTRODUCTION Vehicles in the US are regulated by Title 49 Transportation, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and primarily by Part 571, titled the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The FMVSS 49CFR571.208 exempts individual vehicle manufacturers from meeting federal crash safety standards when they manufacture fewer than 5,000 vehicles of a given type. Because the number of ambulances manufactured per year by all U.S. manufacturers totals less than 5,500 vehicles, ambulances are built and operate outside the general safety umbrella covering most other on-the-road vehicles. As a result of this exemption, existing standards and regulations requiring dynamic or crash testing of completed ambulances do not apply to ambulance construction. Further, this exemption results in a lack of appropriate test data and design criteria on which to base design decisions or evaluations of ambulance patient compartment crashworthiness and occupant crash safety. There are three classifications of ambulances as defined by the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Specification for the Star-of-Life Ambulance, currently KKK-A-1822E1. A Type I is a truck-based chassis cab with an attached patient compartment. A Type II is a standard van with an integral body and a Type III is a van based chassis cab vehicle with an attached patient compartment. The majority of these vehicles are built on Ford F-350/450 (Type I) and E-350/450 (Type II and III) chassis. In general, an ambulance patient compartment built today is a box-shaped structure constructed of extruded aluminum framing with aluminum or fiberglass body panels and is mounted to the chassis with padded mounts. However, it should be noted that some older boxes were made of wood or a combination thereof. All 316</page><page sequence="2">ambulance patient compartments tested in this test program were constructed using aluminum framing with aluminum or fiberglass body panels, mounted with padded mounts per the chassis manufacturer's recommendations, and installed on Ford chassis.2 Because most of the discussion of the patient compartment in this paper is mechanical, it will often be referred to generically as a box. The overall mounting configuration for an ambulance patient compartment varies little from other commercial box trucks and short buses based on truck and van chassis cab vehicles. These vehicles consist of a truck or van chassis with a box or other body type mounted by a second stage manufacturer. While there are differences in curb weight, all of these vehicles have the potential to be loaded to their gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) at times, resulting in the possibility that they are at maximum weight during a crash. The weight of an ambulance patient compartment is approximately 2,268 kg (5,000 lbs.). Because of this, ambulances generally weigh in the 4,536kg to 6,350 kg (10,000 to 14,000 lbs.) range. Commercial chassis cab vehicles are not tested as complete vehicles. Instead, FMVSS 49CFR571.208.s8. 1.1 requires the chassis cab to be tested at 136 kg (300 lb) above curb weight prior to the installation of the patient compartment or a similarly loaded box structure, rather than at or near the GVWR seen in operation or potentially in the crashes of this type of vehicle.3 The primary goal of the project was to evaluate the potential for occupant restraints to provide similar protection for patient compartment occupants as is provided for the front seat occupants during the 48 kph (30 mph) Delta-V NHTSA FMVSS 208 compliance tests. However, the coincident crash testing of four (4) ambulances has provided the research team with vehicle pulse data on which future design decisions may be based to support improvements in ambulance crashworthiness and occupant protection systems. Though anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) were used to test restraint systems in the ambulance patient compartment, no ATDs were present in the cab of the vehicle. Future papers and presentations will address the performance of various occupant protection systems used in this testing and occupant kinematics issues. This paper will review the crush measurements, the acceleration pulse from each vehicle, and provide a generalized pulse recommendation for any future testing of ambulances or related equipment. TESTING AND RESULTS Testing included one side and three frontal crashes of ambulances. It was performed at PMG Technologies, Inc., Blainville, PQ, Canada, through multiple, but related, contracts to the team partners. Testing was performed under the direction of NIOSH and its contractor ARCCA. FRONTAL CRASHES Frontal Impact Test Setup Three ambulances were tested in 48 kph (30 mph) frontal fixed barrier crashes. Two were Type III meeting the GSA (General Services Administration) KKK-A-1822C specification in effect for the year in which they were manufactured and one was a Type III meeting the applicable Ontario Provincial Land Ambulance &amp; Emergency Response Standard.4 The 1993 through 1999 vintage trucks are identified specifically in Table 1, and are shown in Figures 1 through 3, respectively.

In some cases, the vehicle had signs of minor impact damage such as slight bumper distortion or minor body panel distortion. For the tests, the ambulance fuel tanks were filled with Stoddard fluid, and the batteries were removed. The large number of external and internal cabinets of an ambulance served well for holding test equipment. Video recording equipment was located in the front left external patient compartment cabinet. The data acquisition system (DAS) system and DAS battery were located in the right rear external cabinet. A completed ambulance has a payload capacity of 680 to 739.7 kg (1,500 to 1,750 lbs) as specified by GSA KKK-A-1822E. The actual payload limit for the vehicles tested, all dual rear wheeled modular ambulances, was the full 739.7 kg (1,750 lbs.). A typical operational load might include, the driver, EMT, and a patient at 79.5 kg (1751b) each, as well as; main and portable oxygen bottles; stretchers; cots; patient handling equipment; portable and removable medical devices; durable and disposable medical items; communications equipment; chargers; and rescue equipment. While the ambulances tested did not have medical equipment in the patient compartment, their final weight was representative of an operational ambulance, as they were near or above GVWR. The ambulances were loaded with approximately 545 kg (1 ,200 lbs) of test equipment including 5 ATDs, instrumentation, and a cot system, as estimated in Table 2. Approximately 200 kg (440 lbs) of roof insulation, skins and padding was removed from each ambulance in order to let in light from the overhead bank of test lights and to mount lights and cameras with views inside. However, the roof frame-work was left intact. Supplementary supports were added to the box structure to facilitate mounting of the camera systems and restraint systems tested in the ambulance. It is unknown how these added to the structural integrity of the box. Some of the external camera mounts can be seen in Figures 1 through 3. All instrumentation work was completed by PMG Technologies test personnel using vehicles provided by NIOSH (3) and the Ontario Ministry of Health (1). This included the installation of high speed cameras in the interior of each vehicle to capture the motion of each ATD during each crash and exterior to the crash to capture each vehicle's response. There were 116, 116 and 110 channels of data, respectively for each frontal test, monitoring ATD, cot, and vehicle responses. All accelerometers were Endevco brand accelerometers on each vehicle, and the data acquisition system was a DTS TDAS Pro system. Chassis and box accelerometers were mounted on tri-axial blocks. Chassis and patient compartment data was taken at 10 KHz and filtered at CFC 60 as per SAE J211 guidelines. Twenty-four channels, of data, were dedicated to monitoring the accelerations of the patient compartment and chassis. All other channels were used to monitor the ATDs, cot and restraints. Accelerometers were placed at 8 locations on the chassis frame and patient compartment: (Figure 4). It is important to note that accelerometers were placed in locations with the individual axis located along the chassis rails or box members. The effect, of deformations and rigid body rotation of the entire ambulance during the event, was to rotate the local coordinate systems. No attempt was made to transform data from the moving local coordinate systems into the static global coordinate system, parallel to the floor of the test facility. When reading the data it is important to realize that it is with respect to the attitude of the accelerometer at that point in time, for example, the box accelerometers are always parallel to the floor of the ambulance. 318</page><page sequence="4">Accelerometer Location Legend #1 Left-Mid-Chassis Frame Rail (x,y,z) #2 Right-Mid-Chassis Frame Rail (x,y,z) #3 Left-Rear-Chassis Frame Rail (x,y,z) #4 Right-Rear-Chassis Frame Rail (x,y,z) #5 Lower-Front-Box (x,y,z) #6 Lower-Rear-Box (x,y,z) #7 Upper-Front-Box (x,y,z) #8 Upper-Rear-Box (x,y,z) #2 #4 i u : V -®~j Y| I V#7,#5 I #8, #6* X- J #1 #3^ V#7 #8* , "~3 #5 #6 S v v #1 ,#2 #3, #4 Figure 4: General Accelerometer Locations Post Impact Observations and Video Analysis Visually, the reactions of each ambulance in the frontal tests were similar. As the vehicle impacted the barrier, the front end of the ambulance began to crush and the front wheels deflated as they were driven into the bumper. The front cab continued to deform as the rear portions of the vehicle continued moving forward. About 30 ms after impact, the frame between the box and the front cab, began to deform. As the frame bent, the rotating box crushed the top rear of the driver's cab. Once the front lower corner of the box contacted the test facility floor at about 130 ms, the rear tires rose off the ground until the remaining crash energy was dissipated. The ambulance continued to rise until approximately 200-250 ms, (as can be seen later in Figure 9). At beyond 400 ms, slam-down occurred and the entire event was over, as evidenced in the appendix for each test. Ultimately, cab space was compromised by intrusion from both front and rear. Video frames showing crush are shown in Figures 5,6,7 and the included appendices. Restitution, or springback, is expected during a test, producing a different and greater dynamic crush during the test than is measured afterward. Restitution can be seen in the appendices between the 1 60 ms and 400 ms frames of each test at the cab to box interface. Figure 5: Ambulance A, Post Frontal Impact Results Figure 6: Ambulance B, Post Frontal Impact Result Figure 7: Ambulance C, Post Frontal Impact Result Vehicle crush across the front was not uniform top to bottom on the grill. Each front end crushed with an angle to the cab, producing varying degrees of crush top to bottom. The cab rotation produced the angle backward from the front of the cab to the vertical reference plane, while the bottom measurement seemed to represent the vehicle's shortened length in the x-axis. Parallelogramming of the cab during the rotation appeared to reduce the angle in the grill, seen to the 319</page><page sequence="5">greatest extent in ambulance A. Varying crush measurements were taken for the front of each vehicle as ranging from 482.6 mm to 736.6 mm (19 to 29 inches) depending upon the vertical location of measurement. On average, six parameter crush measurements, laterally across the bumper, were 609.6 mm (24 inches) for test A, 673.1 mm (26.5 inches) for test B and 533.4 mm (21 inches) for test C. These values are repeated in Table 2. Figures 8a and 8b show the resulting crushed driver's cab of ambulance A after the frontal crash. Of the three ambulances tested, the post crash space available to the driver was the least in ambulance A. Overall, the steering wheel-to-seat clearance was estimated to be 139.7 to 165.1 mm (5.5 to 6.5 inches) in ambulance A, 165 to 254 mm (6.5 to 10 inches) in ambulance B, and 330.2 to 355.6 mm (13 to 14 inches) in ambulance C. Recognizing SAE J833, Human Physical dimensions (1989), lists chest depth range for the 95th male to 5th female as 280 mm (1 1.02 inches) to 200 mm (7.87 inches) respectively, and SAE J 1522, Truck Driver Stomach Position, would require more clearance for large stomachs, it would appear the post-test clearance available to the driver is inadequate for both ambulance A and B. This can be attributed to the changes in vehicle response and crush when operating with a high mass, high center-of-gravity (CG) loading, as is found in an ambulance patient compartment box. Figure 8a: Cab Crush of Ambulance A Figure 8b: Cab Crush of two (2) of the ambulances. White bar shows the distance between the seat back and top of the steering wheel. Video from a Redlake Camera at 1000 Hz was analyzed at 10 frame (10 ms) intervals to produce the box rotation vs. time graph shown in Figure 9. The pitch was taken as the positive downward angle of the box from level. None of the boxes were observed to be more than 1 .5 degrees out of square in this set of frames. The rotation rate was approximately 83 degrees per second. The rotation of each ambulance was consistent for the first 10° and 150 ms of the tests. Also, note that this graph shows no rotation for the first 20-30 ms of the crashes. Rotation, box mounting, and slight box deformation discrepancies likely account for the bulk of the differences in accelerations for each chassis in both the x-axis and z-axis. It should be noted that the rotation seen in the box resulted in significant z-axis acceleration with the back of the box producing a vertical component in the upward direction while the front of the box accelerated in a direction normal to the floor. 18 I i - - ; 1 ! 1 16 1 Test A - i *"wm " aí 14 .

Figure 10: Longitudinal Frame Rail Accelerations - Ambulance A In the first 20 ms of the crash there was an acceleration of the frame in the forward direction or into the barrier. This indicates that after the initial contact with the barrier, the ambulance frame began to slow then accelerated into the barrier before again being decelerated. When the longitudinal acceleration of the patient compartment or box was reviewed, this acceleration into the barrier, shown in Figure 1 1 , did not exist. This graph also shows the very close agreement between the front and rear accelerometers at both the upper and lower box locations. Comparable agreement was found for each vehicle tested. Figure 1 1 : Longitudinal Patient Compartment Accelerations - Ambulance A This anomaly on the frame accelerations is seen in all three of the frontal impacts conducted. Though the pulses are shaped somewhat differently from vehicle to vehicle, the acceleration of the frame into the barrier was present in each test. Using a comparison of the averaged frame (Accelerometers # 1 through #4), the lower box (Accelerometers #5 and #6), and the upper box accelerations (Accelerometers #7 and #8) of ambulance A, as shown in Figure 12, it is clear the acceleration of the lower patient compartment or box slightly lags the averaged frame acceleration and that the onset rate is less. In addition, the averaged upper patient compartment acceleration lags the averaged frame acceleration even further. Figure 12: Averaged Frame Acceleration, Averaged Lower Box Acceleration, and Averaged upper box acceleration for Ambulance A Upon further review of the electronic and visual data, it was hypothesized that this forward acceleration of the frame occurred when the patient compartment, which is mounted to the frame through rubber bushings, as seen in the Figure 13a, shifts on the frame initially so that its mass is not fully coupled to the frame. At this point, the box is moving at a higher velocity than the frame. As the bushings compress, the mass of the patient compartment becomes fully coupled to the frame, the frame accelerates and the two again decelerate at the same rate. Evidence of the bushing frame interaction is shown, in Figure 13b, by the tearing of the frame at one of the bushings during testing of ambulance B. Indeed, Huang states, while speaking about trucks, that "... the impulsive transient responses at the beginning of the crush are mainly controlled by the damping characteristics of the body mounts, positioned between the compartment (or cab) and frame."6 The additional lag between the upper and lower patient compartment accelerations are due to the distortion or parallelogramming of the box itself and other differences in transmissibility of the mounting locations. As noted from the video analysis there was a dynamic box deformation of approximately 1 .5 degrees out of square during the crash. 321</page><page sequence="7">Figure 13a: Frame-to-box mounting Figure 13b: Deformed F-Type frame bushing (circled) showing post- crash tearing of the chassis frame-rail during Test B The frame accelerometer data from ambulances B and C has more oscillations in the initial 50 ms than the data for ambulance A and occur at a frequency of 60 to 70 Hz. Due to these oscillations, the ambulance frame data was difficult to analyze. For this reason, and recognizing the primary focus of this test program was the patient compartment and its occupants, analysis of the vehicle pulse is based on the patient compartment accelerations as opposed to the frame accelerations. Furthermore, as seen in Figure 12, there are differences between the upper and lower patient compartment accelerometers due to distortion of the box during the crash. In addition, the lower accelerometer data is the most conservative design measurement because it is more closely coupled to the frame and expected to have the highest values within the patient compartment. Therefore, the lower patient compartment accelerometers were used for the analysis of the pulse. The graph in Figure 14 shows the average of the lower front and rear longitudinal accelerometers on the patient compartment for the three tests. Figure 14: Averaged Lower Box Accelerations (#5 and #6) in the X- Axis for all three vehicles. While the patient compartment accelerations have similar oscillations as the frame in ambulances B and C, the underlying signal is much cleaner. Other than the elevated peaks that occur in the first 30 ms, the pulses are very similar in shape, duration, and peak acceleration. The total changes in velocity calculated from these pulses are all within 1 .4 to 4.3 kph (0.9 to 2.7 mph) of the approach speed, which is consistent with the minimal rebound off the barrier seen following the tests. Frontal Impact Results: Z-Axis Acceleration Using ambulance A as the example for this portion of the discussion, Figure 15 shows integrated velocity data for the rear frame, lower box, and upper box. Overall, data for all three ambulances indicates the vertical or z-axis Delta-V range for the rear frame to be 1 1 to 16 kph ( 7 to 10 mph), -10 to -15 kph (-6.2 to -9.3 mph) for the rear of the box, and 9.9 to 15.7 kph (6.1 to 9.7 mph) for the front of the box. It was this difference in z-axis velocity front to back which provided the rotation. While this is small relative to the 48 kph (30 mph) change in the test overall, it is large enough to warrant consideration in the design of some systems, including occupant protection systems and equipment anchorage. Double integration of these signals showed 25 to 66 cm (9.8 to 25.9 in.) movement in the z-axis which is consistent with test observation. 322</page><page sequence="8">9n ZU : : LOC#5 Z TEST A 9n ZU Ì I : : i L0C#6 Z TEST A L0C#5 Z TEST B j.

This was likely due to the deformation of the box structure local to the accelerometers. In addition, upper accelerometers were mounted on less stiff crosswise box members, which led to greater signal attenuation and higher frequency vibrational components. Figure 16 shows this same result to be true in the analysis of z-axis accelerations as well. For instance, in test C a safety net failed and caused the roof members to vibrate with peaks as high as -40 g seen on the z-axis of accelerometer 7. Double integration of the difference between accelerometers 5 and 7 implied the roof members were vibrating approximately 1 cm peak-peak after the net released its tension. In general the data for the three ambulances was very consistent for the first peak which represents the bumper and front sections of the frame responsible for a controlled crush. For ambulance A this peak was 1 1 .5 g in the box front and -15 g in the box rear at 20 ms. The other ambulances had their first peak in the 20-30 ms range. The second major peak occurs at 66-76 ms for the signals. For ambulance A this occurred at 76 ms and was at a level of 1 8.7 g in the box front and -1 1 .8 g in the box rear. Frontal Impact Results: Y-Axis Acceleration Acceleration in the lateral or y-axis was measured during the frontal impact testing. However, given the controlled nature of the testing, acceleration values measured in the y-axis were understandably negligible and likely attributable to slight differences in the lateral CG of each vehicle. Some of the peak values were in the 20-30 g range but were of a generally oscillatory nature, comprising a very negligible change in velocity. Double integration to yield displacement provided values of approximately 305 mm (12 inches). This was similar to the lateral rotation visually observed. Because of the comparative low-energy of these values no more discussion will be made. Resultant Accelerations: Lower Box: The resultant peak acceleration of the patient compartment was somewhat higher for ambulance C, while the pulse duration of ambulance C was also about 15 ms shorter than that of ambulances A and B. This finding is consistent with the less severe frontal crush damage for ambulance C and as seen in the three photographs (Figures 5 through 7). Table 2 provides a summary of the key pulse components for all three ambulances tested, as well as, resultant pulses measured in this test effort. Figure 17a, 17b, and 17c. provides a review of the resultant accelerations plotted for each of the three frontal impact tests completed.

LATERAL IMPACT TEST The purpose of the side impact testing was to support the investigation of occupant protection systems in the patient compartment. Only one vehicle was tested because the test program focused on the frontal mode. The test scenario was selected for several reasons. First, a comparable test for two side facing occupants being tested in the patient compartment was desired. Second, the team was trying to crash in a comparable manner to sled testing we had previously performed. And finally, a 90 degree impact would deliver a more significant change in velocity in the lateral direction. Lateral Impact Test Setup The fourth crash test conducted was an impact into the left or street side of a stationary Type I ambulance. The ambulance used was built on a 1994 Ford F-350 chassis. It was impacted by a 1984 GMC Sierra C2500 crew cab dump truck, weighing 3351 kg (7388 lbs.). The pre-impact speed of the truck was 64.0 kph (39.8 mph). The goal of this test was to have the ambulance experience a crash with a change in speed or Delta-V of 27.4 kph (17 mph). The approach speed of the truck was chosen accordingly. The ambulance was pre-positioned such that the center of impact for the crash was at the center of gravity of the ambulance in its test configuration. The impact position and vehicle orientations are shown in Figures 18 and 19, respectively. 324</page><page sequence="10">Figure 18: Ambulance Position, Pre-Lateral Impact Figure 19: Ambulance and Bullet Vehicle Alignment, Pre-Lateral Impact The ambulance accelerations, in all three axes, were measured at eight locations as in Figure 4; four on the frame, two on the lower patient compartment, and two on the upper patient compartment. Two accelerometers were mounted on the left and right frame rails of the ambulance, approximately two feet rearward of the junction between the driver's compartment, and two were mounted behind the rear wheels. The patient compartment accelerometers were mounted to the front and rear of the patient compartment on the structural members that support the floor and ceiling. However, in this test there was a three-axis accelerometer placed in the bullet vehicle cab. The x-axis was aligned longitudinally along the bullet vehicle. Lateral Impact Observations and Data Analysis Review of the vehicle acceleration data from the side impact revealed a very complex crash pulse with wide variation in data among the accelerometer locations. Much of this complexity was the result of distortion of the ambulance chassis and localized deformations near the accelerometers during the impact. As can be seen in the series of video frames presented in Figure 20, the center of the ambulance was more rapidly accelerated during the initial impact as the ambulance wrapped around the intruding truck, while the front and rear sections remained nearly stationary. A more detailed look into the crash is available in Appendix D. Figure 20: Lateral Impact, Front Exterior View As seen in the graph in Figure 21, distortion of the ambulance resulted in much lower accelerations at the rear frame than at the mid-frame. As would be expected, the acceleration measured on the impacted left side of the mid frame led the acceleration on the right side of the frame. The graph of the frame accelerations also shows that the right frame rail experienced higher lateral (y-axis) acceleration than the left side. This is likely related to localized distortion in the initial 10 to 15 ms of the crash. The data from the right side mid-frame accelerometer was lost at 40 ms and the left side mid-frame accelerometer data is questionable beyond 100 ms. Given the variations seen between the frame's lateral acceleration data, the data from the lower ambulance box accelerometers was reviewed. 70 A MID FRAME LEFT 0Q Ą A ' ACCELERATION Y |.

Considering solely the forward box accelerometer, one might conclude that the crash was less than 80 ms. However, the rear box acceleration indicates the crash duration is over 160 ms. The measured difference is due to the bending and rotation of the ambulance during the impact. As the data from the box acceleration indicates, and is shown in Figure 22, the front of the box was rapidly accelerated by the impact and reached its peak velocity of 32.5 kph (20.2 mph) in approximately 75 ms. Subsequently, this portion of the ambulance actually began to decelerate. As seen in the video and the still frames in Figure 20, the rear of the ambulance did not accelerate as rapidly as the center section of the ambulance. In fact, the rear box accelerometer indicated that the back of the box continued to accelerate for 165 ms before reaching its maximum velocity of 28.0 (17.4 mph). The graph in Figure 23 illustrates these velocities. 70 i 1 1 = .

However, the actual magnitude and duration of the accelerations that would be experienced by occupants varies greatly with the actual position in the vehicle. The crash duration was confirmed by the longitudinal acceleration of the bullet vehicle shown in Figure 24. 5 ^ &lt;1 0.05 I ~ 3 5 ~ -20 J Figure 24: Longitudinal Bullet Vehicle Acceleration Review of the bullet vehicle longitudinal acceleration and the crash video indicates the center portion of the ambulance was accelerated for the first 80 ms at which point the ambulance tires began to slide laterally. At the same time the deceleration of the bullet vehicle decreased, as is seen on the graph in Figure 24 where the acceleration plot crosses zero for the first time. The ambulance continued to accelerate for about 180 ms due to loading from the bullet vehicle. This is coincident with the second time the bullet vehicle acceleration crosses zero. In addition Figure 23 supports this by showing that the bullet vehicle velocity, determined by integration, dropped below the average box velocity at 161 ms and 25 kph, and the bullet vehicle velocity dropped below the lower front box velocity at 176.9 ms and 22.3 kph. While there continued to be interaction between the bullet vehicle and the ambulance beyond 1 80 ms, it had little effect on the velocity of the ambulance. Thus, the data from the accelerations of both vehicles are consistent with a crash-pulse duration of between 160 and 180 ms. Additionally, as Figure 23, the lateral ambulance box velocity graph shows, the front and rear of the box were traveling an average of 25 kph (15.5 mph) at 200 ms. Analysis using the conservation of momentum and the masses and initial velocities of the two vehicles predicts an exit velocity for both the vehicles of 25.9 kph (16.1 mph). This speed falls between the velocities of the front and rear of the box between 160 and 180 ms. What is clear from this test is that the interaction of these two vehicles is very complex and not as easily quantified 326</page><page sequence="12">as it is for the frontal rigid barrier impacts. In fact, following the impact, the ambulance initially began to tip toward the bullet vehicle before rolling away and coming to rest on its right side, i.e. a 90 degree roll. The tip toward the bullet vehicle during the crash and the final position of the ambulance are shown in the photographs in Figures 25 and 26, respectively. Figure 25: Tip Toward Bullet Vehicle, Time = 240 ms Figure 26: Final Ambulance Position Given the analysis just discussed, the basic crash parameters, based on the accelerations from the patient compartment of the ambulance are shown in Table 3: Table 3: Lateral Crash Test Results Bullet Vehicle Approach Speed 64.01 kph kph (mph) (39.78 mph) Delta-V from Box Gy kph (mph) (^5 5^mph) Peak of Average Lower Box Gy 1 m Q 1 Signal 1 m Q Peak of Average Lower Box 1Q7 Resultant G Signal Approx. Pulse Duration (sec) 0. 1 60 - 0. 1 80 CONCLUSION Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards exempt the manufacturers of ambulance patient compartments from many of the safety requirements imposed on passenger vehicle manufacturers. In addition, prior to the development and completion of this test program, the industry did not have readily available crash test pulse data on which to base basic design, test, or evaluation decisions to improve the safety of the vehicle independent of Federal regulations. As a result of this work, the industry is now provided with front and side impact data of modern ambulances at FMVSS test levels which can be used to develop test criteria or to model and assess the safety of both equipment and the patient compartment of Type I and Type III ambulances. Through this work, several vehicle design considerations have been revealed which can have a significant impact on the safety and health of both front seat and patient compartment occupants. It is clear that ambulance chassis cab designers should consider the crush effects not only to the front of the vehicle, but also to the back of the operators cab, during a frontal impact. Figures 8a and 8b best illustrate this design issue. The severity of this damage directly results from the high mass of the ambulance itself. As there appears to be a trend toward increasing the mass of these vehicles, the energy that must be dissipated in a crash through crush of the vehicle will continue to increase. While stiffening the vehicle frame would serve to reduce the level of intrusion found in the driver's cab, this would potentially increase vehicle accelerations on occupants due to a reduction in vehicle crush. It is obvious that a systems approach to energy management should be considered to protect all occupants in the front and back. While no truck based ambulances were tested, the authors believe this problem is amplified in the van type chassis due to the lack of available crush space forward of the driver. The greatest problem pointed to by this data is that the chassis are required to be tested by the chassis (incomplete vehicle) manufacturer at what appears to be the curb weight plus 300 lbs. Thus a chassis weighing 327</page><page sequence="13">5,000 lbs would be tested at 5300 lbs. However the operational weight of a completed vehicle built using the chassis would be about 1 1 ,000 lbs. This equates to a crash energy approximately 2.07 times higher than the tested chassis. As a comparison, in order for the 5300 lbs. chassis cab to be tested at that energy level it would have to be crashed at a velocity 1.44 times higher; this would be 43 mph instead of 30 mph. In addition, ambulance and chassis manufacturers should consider a systems design approach where the box interaction, chassis performance, and increased weight effects are taken into account. While performing testing might be difficult for small individual ambulance manufacturers (complete vehicle), it should be possible for the chassis manufacturers (incomplete vehicle) to test and design the chassis with a similar load , mounting scheme and CG height. Recognizing too few vehicles are built by any one ambulance manufacturer to require crash testing at an estimated GVWR of approximately 1 1 ,000 lbs, the resulting situation is that ambulance manufacturers and other commercial vehicle manufacturers, are probably using chassis from all manufacturers, which are not tested at more than half their GVWR. This test program provides baseline acceleration pulses that can be used for the design, development, evaluation, and testing of ambulance components including seating and restraint systems, gurneys, gurney mounting systems, and various equipment and equipment mounting systems that are present in the ambulance patient compartment. The crash data provides acceleration levels that can be used in conjunction with the mass of the item to be restrained, to generate future design and static test requirements. Additionally, the pulses from this testing can be used to define the input loading for dynamic testing of each ambulance component, piece of equipment, or for occupant safety. Any design effort in the patient compartment of an ambulance should recognize that a significant acceleration in the vertical plane (z-axis) is likely to exist due to the pitch up, or forward rotation of the patient compartment, during a frontal impact. Similar vertical accelerations also occur during rollover and slam down crashes and should be considered. Inclusion of this component can also have significant ramifications for the design and installation of occupant restraints and equipment mounts in the patient compartment of an ambulance. Pertinent results to best assess this component of the frontal crash pulse are found in Figure 16 and in the appendices. Two primary tenets of occupant protection are that the occupant space must be maintained and that there should be no equipment flying around to injure the occupants. The aluminum structure of the patient compartments tested maintained their shape and though not shown, virtually no intrusion into the patient compartment was observed in the selected frontal or side impact scenarios. Data has been presented which will aid in the future design and evaluation of occupant safety systems. Given the acceleration levels seen, the authors believe there is promise for the future design of safer occupant protection systems and equipment retention standards in these vehicles.
