ABSTRACT A finite element model of the human lower extremity has been developed to predict lower extremity injuries in full frontal and offset frontal impact. The model included 30 bones from femur to toes. Each bone was modeled using crushable solid elements for the trabecular bone and damageable shell elements for the cortical bone. The models of the long bones for the lower extremities were validated against data obtained from quasi-static 3-point bending tests by Yamada (1970). The ankle, knee and hip joints were modeled as bone-to-bone contacts and included major ligaments and tendons. The ankle model was validated against data obtained from quasi-static dorsiflexion, inversion and eversión tests by Petit et al. (1996) and against data obtained from dynamic impact cadaveric tests by Kitagawa et al. (1998). The possibility of using this model to predict injuries was discussed. The Tibia Index, which has been used to predict lower extremity injuries in automotive crashes, was calculated and the effectiveness of the Tibia Index was discussed. INTRODUCTION Lower extremity injury is the second most common injury after head injury in automotive crashes. Such injuries are seldom fatal as in the case of head injury, but can result in long-term disability and impairment. Morgan et al.(1991) analyzed NASS data from 1979-1986 and reported that lower extremity injuries amounted to about 25% of AIS 2+ injuries in all body regions for both non- belted and belted occupants in frontal automotive impacts. Based on an analysis of 1990-1992 NASS files, Crandall et al.(1994) reported that upper and lower extremity injuries are still frequent in drivers protected by airbags while head and neck injuries decreased in com- parison to cases without the airbag. These reports sug- gest that no countermeasure has been proven to be effective in reducing lower extremity injuries. Therefore, a good understanding of the lower extremity injury mecha- nisms and a good tool for predicting these injuries is a critical step in the improvement of current measures taken to protect occupants in automotive crashes. Among lower extremity injuries, ankle and foot injuries are very important because of their frequency and asso- ciated long-term impairment. Morgan et al.(1 991 ) reported that ankle/foot injuries are the most commonly injured area with a rate of 32% and 34% for non-belted and belted occupants, respectively. An extensive survey of NASS data suggested that a probable ankle injury mechanism was the transfer of load through the pedal to the ankle causing dorsiflexion as well as an axis passing through the talus-tibia-fibula. Otte et al.(1992) studied various types of ankle and foot injuries based on data from 140 belted drivers from 1985 to 1990. Ankle joint injury was the most frequent at a rate of 37.1% followed by the metatarsal bone at a rate of 36.1%. This study also suggested that the origins of lesions were from direct pedal impact at the foot, foot rotations and com- pression between intruding structures and the body's inertial effect. Kitagawa et al.(1998) conducted dynamic impact tests using human cadaveric lower legs to investi- gate the combined effects of muscle preloading during an emergency braking and pedal impact force. They reported that preloading of the Achilles tendon signifi- cantly increased the tibial axial force and that the combi- nation of impact force from the pedal resulted in 5 pylon fractures and 1 0 calcaneal fractures out of 1 6 specimens. Injury risk due to pedal interaction with and without mus- cle preloading and intrusion has been discussed in previ- ous work. However, the injury mechanisms of the ankle/ foot region are not well known. 846</page><page sequence="2">The Tibia Index (TI) is the injury tolerance criterion for the combined axial and rotational dynamic loading of the lower extremity as measured by anthropometric test dummy tibial load-cells (Mertz,1993). Haland et al.(1998) studied the effect of an Inflatable Carpet on lower extrem- ity injuries by using foot acceleration, tibial axial force and Tibia Index of Hybrid III dummy as injury assessment ref- erence values. Foot acceleration was reduced by 33 to 66%, the tibia force by 22 to 49% and the upper Tibia Index by 30 to 62%, when the results from tests with the Inflatable Carpet were compared with the tests without it. Thus, the Tibia Index has been used in the automotive industry as an injury criterion for the lower extremity. However, some reseachers have questioned the effec- tiveness of the Tibia Index because the basis of the index is not entirely clear and therefore its use may lead to unsafe vehicle designs. Schreiber et al. (1998) conducted 3-point bending tests using cadaveric lower leg including soft tissues. They noted that the Tibia Index is likely to underestimate the failure threshold of bones in both quasi-static and dynamic bending. Recently, a relatively high number of finite element mod- els of the lower extremity have been developed to repro- duce the kinematics and kinetics, and to explore the injury mechanism of the lower extremity, especially the ankle/foot complex. Tannous et al. (1996) developed a detailed ankle/foot model including all bones of the ankle/ foot region, ankle joint ligaments, retinacula and plantar soft tissues. The model was validated against accelera- tion and force time histories from axial impact cadaveric tests of the plantar surface of the foot by Yoganandan et al. (1995). Stress and strain of bones predicted by the model were compared with the ultimate stress and strain in the literature. Beaugonin et al.(1997) also developed an ankle/foot model including the bones, ligaments and retinacula of the ankle/foot region. They validated this model against force and angle time histories for dorsiflex- ion and acceleration time histories for inversion and ever- sión of cadaveric tests conducted by Begeman et al. (1991 and 1993). Beillas et al.(1999) also developed an ankle/foot model including bones, ligaments and plantar soft tissues, which was validated against moment-angle properties of cadaveric dynamic dorsiflexion tests per- formed by Crandall et al.(1996). Thus there are some models which can reproduce the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity and can be used to calculate the stress and strain response of bones in the ankle/foot region. However, none of the above mentioned models can be used to predict the injuries of the lower extremity. In this study, a finite element model of the human lower extremity has been developed to predict the injuries in full frontal and offset frontal impacts. As a first step, joint ele- ments including the moment-angle properties in each articulation were used to model the articulations of the ankle, knee and hip as reported by Furusu et al. (1999). The model including the joint elements was validated against dynamic ankle dorsiflexion tests conducted by Crandall et al. (1996) and volunteer sled tests conducted by Begeman et al.(1980). This method could be used to model the joint articulations which were not focused in the analyses in order to save CPU time. As a second step, the ankle, knee and hip articulations were modeled by bone-to-bone contacts with major ligaments and ten- dons. In this paper, the joint articulations were modeled by bone-to-bone contacts and the ankle/foot regional model was validated against quasi-static dorsiflexion, inversion and eversión and dynamic impact tests. All sim- ulations were conducted using the explicit finite element analysis code PAM-CRASH. LOWER EXTREMITY MODEL The finite element model of the human lower extremity used in this study is shown in Figure 1 . Basic anthropo- metric data of the skeletal portion of the lower extremity model were taken from a commercial data package of the human lower extremity geometry (Viewpoint Datalabs), which was scaled to fit a 50th percentile male. This model included 30 bones from the femur to toes. Each bone was modeled in two parts. The trabecular bone was modeled using crushable solid elements and the cortical bone was modeled using damageable shell elements. The basic material properties of each bone were taken from Yamada (1970). This model also includes the ankle, knee and hip joints, which were modeled as bone-to-bone con- tacts with the major ligaments and tendons. Each liga- ment was modeled using membrane elements with elastic properties in tension and each tendon was mod- eled using bar elements. Figure 2 shows a finite element model of the ankle/foot region. The basic material proper- ties of the ligaments and tendons were based on those reported by Yamada (1970) and Abe et al.(1996). The dimensions of the ligaments and tendons were deter- mined by refering to anatomical texts and illustrations by Gray(1973). The material properties used in this lower extremity model are shown in Table 1 . Figure 1 . A finite element model of the lower extremity 847</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2.

Contrary to implicit meth- ods, the analysis of quasi-statically loaded problems, in which there are no inertia effects, is not easily treated using the explicit method. Recently, the explicit dynamic codes were used for quasi-static large deformation analy- sis using two methods as described by Pickett et al. (1992). The first method artificially increases the mate- rial density to obtain acceptable solutions with minor iner- tia effects. The second approach uses the "Dynamic Relaxation" technique in which an iterative solution of the dynamic equations of motions with viscous damping is made to yield an approximate static solution. In this study, the first method was used with the application of a suitable load function and by increasing the material den- sity by 1 00 times. By adopting this method, realistic solu- tions can be achieved without the cost of high CPU time from many practical studies. QUASI-STATIC BENDING RESPONSES OF LONG BONES - In 1970, Yamada published load-deflection data from quasi-static 3-point bending tests of wet long bones from cadavers of age ranging from 20 to 39 years. In these tests, the long bones were supported by plaster or concrete at bottom ends and then the center of the long bones was loaded to failure by the loading head of a testing machine in an anteroposterior direction. In this study, quasi-static 3-point bending simulations were con- ducted to validate the model of the femur, tibia and fibula against force-deflection properties. Each bone was fully fixed at the posterior ends and the center of each bone was compressed gradually at a constant velocity of 1 00 mm/s to reproduce test conditions as shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows a comparison of simulation results and test data for force-deflection curves of the femur, tibia and fibula. Simulation results shows good correlation with test data for all tests of long bones. The results show that all three long bone models have a human-like response for the quasi-static bending in anteroposterior direction. Figure 3. Quasi-static bending simulation model of the femur.

QUASI-STATIC DORSIFLEXION, XVERSION RESPONSES OF THE ANKLE JOINT - Parenteau et al.(1995) conducted quasi-static tests in dorsiflexion, inversion and eversión using amputated cadaveric lower limbs, and obtained moment-angle responses of the human ankle joints about an average center of rotation without muscle tension on the Achilles tendon. In this study, the quasi-static simulations in dorsiflexion, inver- sion and eversión were performed to validate the responses of the ankle joint model without muscle ten- sion. Figure 5 shows a set-up of the quasi-static simula- tions. The boundary conditions assumed by the model were the same as those described in detail by Petit et al.(1 996). In their experiments, muscle tension was added to the experiments described by Parenteau et al.(1995). The leg was amputated 15cm above the malle- olus and the proximal end of the leg was fixed to a flat plate which was free to move in the X and Z directions. To balance the leg on the flat plate, a constant tension of 1 1 N was applied through wires that were used to connect the flat plate and the Achilles tendon. A motor shaft was connected rigidly to the calcaneus along the Y direction for dorsiflexion and along the X direction for inversion/ eversión. An angular movement can be applied by the shaft at a constant velocity of 0.1rad/s in both dorsiflexion and inversion/eversion tests. The moment-angle responses at the center of rotation of the ankle were cal- culated both in dorsiflexion and inversion/eversion. Figure 6 compares the moment-angle responses of simulation results with test data in dorsiflexion. Simulation results are within the corridors and show good agreement with test data. Figure 6 compares the moment-angle responses of simulation results with those of test data in inversion/eversion. Simulation results also show good agreement with test data. These results show that the ankle joint model represents a human-like response simi- lar to the quasi-static response of the human ankle joint. Figure 6.

(1998) conducted dynamic impact tests using human cadaveric lower leg to investigate the com- bined effect of muscle preloading by emergency braking and the associated pedal impact force. A constant tendon force was applied to the calcaneus, while an external impact force was applied to the forefoot by a rigid pendu- lum. In this study, the dynamic impact simulations were conducted to validate the ankle/foot region of the model against dynamic responses with simulated muscle ten- sion applied to the Achilles tendon in frontal impact. Fig- ure 8 shows the setup for the dynamic impact simulations. The boundary conditions used for the simu- lations carefully reproduced those parameters used in the tests conducted by Kitagawa et al.. The leg was cut at the proximal end. The nodes at the proximal end of the tibia and fibula were fixed to a flat plate which was free to 849</page><page sequence="5">move only in the axial direction (the Z direction). The dis- placement of the proximal end with the flat plate was con- strained to allow no more than 10mm displacement in order to reproduce the entrapment of the knee by the lower dashboard in a frontal crash. The foot plate was modeled by shell elements and a part of it was rigidly attached to the forefoot. The pendulum was modeled by a pad and a small portion of the rigid impactor. The vertical position of the centerline of the pendumum was located 50mm below the tibial axis. An 1kN Achilles tendon force was applied to a node of the calcaneus. This force was increased gradually (over 45ms) from zero to 1 kN before impact and then a constant force was maintained until the end of impact. The soft tissue was added to the plantar surface of the foot in order to absorb part of the impact energy. The pendulum hit the forefoot at 3.5m/s, which was the average velocity of the injured specimens in the tests. The impactor force, and the force and moment at the proximal tibial end were calculated. Data from a test in which calcaneal fractures were sustained was used for comparison with simulation results. Figure 9 compares the impactor force and the tibial axial force of simulation results with those of test data. The impactor force and tib- ial force of simulation results showed good agreement with those of test data at the first and second prominent peaks, although both forces of simulation results were dif- ferent from those of test data from 8ms through 30ms after impact. The reason for this inconsistency is not yet clear. Figure 10 compares the sagittal moment My and the lateral moment Mx measured at the proximal tibial end for both simulation results and test data. A negative My corresponds to dorsiflexion and a positive Mx corre- sponds to eversión. Simluation results generally show good agreement with test data in My, although Mx of sim- ulation results is quite different from that of test data from 4ms through 17ms after impact. This inconsistency is probably due to the stiffness of some ligaments which could play a major role to restrain the movement in inver- sion and eversión. Figure 8. Simulation model for dynamic impact. DISCUSSION Simulations based on the criteria in fracture mechanics could be needed to predict fractures and failures of biom- aterials using the finite element method. Bedewi et al. (1998) conducted quasi-static fracture simulations of long bones based on a Crack Tip Opening Angle Criteria and a plastic energy criteria in fracture mechanics. They were able to predict crack propagations in axial tension, axial compression, pure axial torsion and simple four- point bending. However, their method could increase the CPU time and has not been adequately established for dynamic fracture simulations to warrant its use. As an alternative, it is believed that injuries can be predicted when mechanical values predicted based on an assumed injury criterion exceed injury thresholds. It is also believed that the regions of injury would be coincident as those regions with high mechanical values. In this study, as an injury criterion, bone fractures were assumed to occur when the maximum equivalent stress exceeded the ultimate strength obtained from the literature for the corti- cal bone. Yamada (1970) also reported on the failure loads of long bones in quasi-static 3-point bending tests. Table 2 compares the applied load for simulation results and test data at which the bone fractures occurred. Test data show the average failure loads of wet long bones from cadavers of age ranging from 20 to 39 years. Simu- lation results show good correlation with test data. Figure 9.

They found 5 pylon fractures and 1 0 calcaneal frac- tures out of 16 specimens. Figure 1 1 shows stress distri- bution in the cortical bones at 6 ms after impact. In all cadaveric tests where injuries were seen, the maximum peak in the tibial axial force appeared 5 or 6 ms after impact. It was at this time that pylon fractures or the cal- caneal fractures occurred. Stresses predicted by the model exceed the ultimate strength of the cortical bone (140MPa) at the calcaneus and the distal tibia where fractures were observed upon autopsy. Although it is not clear that bone fractures occur when the maximum stress exceeds the ultimate strength in actual bones, these results demonstrate that bone fractures in the lower extremity can be generally predicted by this model and this criterion. Figure 1 1 . Stress distribution of cortical bones of the ankle/foot region in dynamic impact. As described by Schreiber et al.(1998), the Tibia Index (TI) is given by F M TI =- +- &lt;1.0 F&lt;8kN (1) Fc Mc Where F is the measured compressive axial force (kN) in the Z direction. M was originally the measured bending moment in the Y direction (Nm), but was later revised to, M = a/Mx2 + My2 (2) That is, M is the resultant bending moment in the X and Y directions. Mc and Fc assumed to be 225Nm and 35.9kN, respectively, for a 50th percentile male occupant. A TI of 1.0 or greater exceeds the injury threshold. A threshold of 1 .3 in TI is currently in use by the EEVC. The TI has an additional constraint which has a upper limit of 8kN in Z component, twice the load required to fracture either the medial or lateral aspects of the tibial plateau or femoral condyles. The magnitudes of Mc and Fc are based on values published by Yamada (1970) from stud- ies on quasi-static 3-point bending and axial compres- sion. In the dynamic impact simulations, TI was calculated at the distal tibia and the proximal tibia as shown in Figure 12. As mentioned above, bone fractures at the calcaneus and the distal tibia occurred at about 6ms after impact in both the cadaveric tests and the dynamic impact simulations. However, TI at the distal tibia was 0.5 and TI at the proximal tibia was 0.42 both at 6ms after impact, which were below the value of 1 .0 for the TI threshold. No injury could be predicted by TI. This shows that TI may underestimate the injuries in frontal impact. This reason was taken into consideration by com- paring Figure 12 with Figures 9 and 10. As shown in Fig- ure 9, the tibial axial force was about 7kN at 6ms after impact, which was less than 35.9kN of Fc. As shown in Figure 10, Mx and My were both about 70Nm at the same time, which were less than 225Nm of Mc because dorsiflexion and eversión were rather small in magnitude. Therefore, TI could be less than 1.0 according to the equation (1). In this dynamic impact, muscle preloading at the Achilles tendon significantly Increased the tibial axial force, and the tibial axial force caused injuries to occur at about 7kN before the dorsiflexion and eversión of the ankle, which increase the moment term of the equation (1). Therefore, the validity of the force term of the equation (1 ) should be questioned. As described by Schreiber et al.(1998), results obtained from the calcu- lated TI in dynamic simulations under the restricted con- dition show that the TI is likely to underestimate the injuries of lower extremity in frontal impact. Figure 1 2. The Tibia Index at the distal tibia and the proximal tibia obtained from the simulations. 851</page><page sequence="7">Although more studies are needed to further validate the lower extremity model, it was shown that the model could be a good tool to predict the injuries and understand the injury mechanism. Furthermore, the model may be useful to develop an index for use as the lower extremity injury criteria. In this study, this lower extremity model was inte- grated into other pre-existing finite element models of the human body developed in several of our recent studies. The whole body model was then integrated into a simpli- fied internal structures of a vehicle as shown in Figure 13. In future work, more studies using this whole body human model including internal structures of a vehicle will be performed and simulation results will be compared with that obtained from sled tests. It is hoped that better understanding of the injury mechanism could be achieved. Subsequently, additional occupant protection devices will be developed and tested in full frontal and offset frontal automotive crashes. Figure 1 3. A finite element model of the whole human body for analyses of lower extremity injuries in frontal and offset frontal crash. CONCLUSIONS 1 . A finite element model of the human lower extremity has been developed to predict lower extremity inju- ries for later application in full frontal and offset fron- tal crashes. 2. Long bone models of the femur, tibia and fibula were validated against load-deflection curves of quasi- static 3-point bending tests. Simulation results demon-strated good agreeement with test data. 3. The ankle joint model was validated against quasi- static response in dorsiflexion, inversion and eversión and simulation results demonstrated good agree- ment with test data. 4. The ankle/foot region of the lower extremity model was validated against cadaveric dynamic impact tests with muscle tension on the Achilles tendon. Although the model did not perfectly match the test data, simulation results for impactor force, and force and moment at the proximal tibial end show good agreement with test data. 5. Fractures of the long bones under quasi-static bend- ing were predicted well by the model. Additionally, by assuming that bone fractures occur when the maxi- mum stress obtained from a simulation exceeds the ultimate strength that was published in the literature, fractures of the bones of the ankle/foot region can be predicted well using the injury criterion selected for this model. 6. The Tibia Index (TI) calculated using the model was lower than that reported for the TI threshold when bone fractures occurred both in the cadaveric tests and in the dynamic impact simulations. These find- ings suggest that the TI could underestimate the injury in frontal impact.
